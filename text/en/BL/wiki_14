<text>Legend Entertainment Company was an American developer and publisher of computer games, best known for creating adventure titles throughout the 1990s. The company was founded by Bob Bates and Mike Verdu, both veterans of the interactive fiction studio Infocom that shut down in 1989. Legend&#x27;s first two games, &quot;Spellcasting 101: Sorcerers Get All the Girls&quot; and &quot;Timequest,&quot; had strong sales that sustained the company. Legend also profited from negotiating licenses to popular book series, allowing them to create notable game adaptations such as &quot;Companions of Xanth&quot; (based on &quot;Demons Don&#x27;t Dream&quot; by Piers Anthony) and &quot;Gateway&quot; (based on the eponymous novel by Frederik Pohl)&quot;.&quot; Legend also earned a reputation for comedic adventures, with numerous awards for &quot;Eric the Unready&quot; in 1993. As the technology of the game industry changed, Legend continued to expand its game engine to take advantage of higher graphical fidelity, mouse support, and the increased media storage of the compact disc.

These industry changes led to difficult competition by the mid-1990s, especially in the adventure game genre. Legend secured an investment from book publishing company Random House and developed additional book adaptations, such as &quot;Death Gate&quot; and &quot;Shannara&quot;, as well as original titles such as &quot;Mission Critical&quot;. However, the company&#x27;s expenses for graphics were rising without a similar increase in sales, causing Random House to exit the game industry. Legend found game publishers to take over marketing and distribution so it could focus its efforts exclusively on development. While the studio&#x27;s adventure titles suffered in the changing marketplace, working with game publishers allowed Legend to experiment with more action-oriented titles such as &quot;Star Control 3&quot;. In its final years, Legend fully pivoted to first-person shooters thanks to a growing relationship with &quot;Unreal&quot; developer Tim Sweeney and an acquisition by publisher GT Interactive. The studio released the 1999 game adaptation of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; book series, designed using the Unreal Engine as a first-person action game. However, Legend&#x27;s sales continued to dwindle, followed by the difficult development and commercial failure of &quot;Unreal II: The Awakening&quot; in 2003. The studio was shut down in January 2004, with staff moving to other game companies.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Legend Entertainment was founded in 1989 by Bob Bates and Mike Verdu. The duo met in the 1980s working at Infocom, a critically acclaimed developer of adventure games and interactive fiction. After the commercial success of the &quot;Zork&quot; series, Activision acquired Infocom in 1986. They closed the studio three years later due to rising costs, falling profits, and technical issues with MS-DOS. Bates decided to seek investment for a new game company, hoping to succeed where Infocom had declined. He told investors that the adventure genre was still viable, but it needed to evolve beyond just text. After securing funding from defense contractor American Systems Corporation, Legend Entertainment opened by the end of the year, choosing the name &quot;Legend&quot; for its connotations in storytelling. Through its lifetime, the studio operated out of Chantilly, Virginia, the home of American Systems Corporation.

Initially, the studio recruited former colleagues from Infocom for their experience, including programmer Mark Poesch, and Steve Meretzky as an author and developer. Founder Bob Bates worked with Meretzky on the company&#x27;s first games. Although they had experience developing an adventure game engine at Infocom, Legend hired an outside team to develop their new text parser in order to avoid infringing the copyright of their old Infocom engine. Legend&#x27;s debut title was &quot;Spellcasting 101: Sorcerers Get All the Girls,&quot; which expanded on Infocom&#x27;s text-based adventures by adding graphics for each of the game&#x27;s rooms. Meretzky described this as a &quot;fusion of the depth and detail of Infocom games with a graphical presentation that would be more in keeping with what audiences circa 1990 demanded&quot;, which led to greater sales than their former studio had. Although Legend was worried that the game&#x27;s raunchy humor might upset their investors in the defense industry, they were relieved that their investors were supportive. At the same time, Bates was developing &quot;Timequest&quot; with the goal of proving there was still a market for adventure games with intricate puzzles. Legend released &quot;Timequest&quot; the following year. These first two games earned attention for continuing the legacy of Infocom and signaled a potential rebirth for the adventure game genre.

Legend also benefitted from a strong relationship with traditional book publishers, securing licensing deals for their team&#x27;s favorite authors while costs were still low. One of the first major licenses was Frederik Pohl&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Gateway&quot;, adapted into a game of the same name using Legend&#x27;s now-established adventure game engine. While all of Legend&#x27;s games featured graphics, it was possible to turn off graphics for their first few games, and play them as if they were classic text adventures. By the end of 1992, Legend were able to buy back American Systems Corporation&#x27;s stake in the company, and they were selling enough games to easily sustain themselves.

=== Point-and-click adventures ===
In 1993, Legend released &quot;Gateway II&quot; as their last graphic adventure that could still be played in a text-only mode. The studio continued to expand their game engine, adapting to the popularity of the mouse and the increased media storage of the compact disc. The first project to take advantage of CD-ROM technology was &quot;Companions of Xanth&quot;, which signaled Legend&#x27;s shift from traditional text adventures to a point-and-click interface. Programmer Michael Lindner had gained valuable design experience from working on &quot;Gateway&quot;, allowing him to create &quot;Companions of Xarth&quot; as a solo project. Based on the novel &quot;Demons Don&#x27;t Dream&quot; by Piers Anthony, the game was the first of several games built on the same graphic adventure engine. &quot;Companions of Xarth&quot; was released in 1993, followed by the release of &quot;Eric the Unready&quot;. The latter game received several awards and nominations, particularly &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Adventure Game of the Year in 1993 (as a tie with &quot;Star Control II&quot;). With the release of &quot;Companions of Xanth&quot; and &quot;Eric the Unready,&quot; Legend earned a reputation for comedic adventures. However, Legend&#x27;s business also began to shift with rising production costs for game graphics. 
Around this time, Mark Poesch joined full-time as the director of research and development. In 1994, Legend enabled Glen Dahlgren to release his first solo project as &quot;Death Gate&quot;, an adaptation of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman&#x27;s fantasy book series &quot;The Death Gate Cycle&quot;. That same year, Legend released &quot;Superhero League of Hoboken&quot;, where writer Steve Meretzky updated his brand of comedy. The game was nominated for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1994 &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; award, praising Meretzky&#x27;s comedic dialog and imagination. However, the game sold fewer than 25,000 copies and became Meretzky&#x27;s last title with Legend.

Adventure games were at their peak in the early 1990s, but the studio was facing difficult competition in the genre from Sierra On-Line and LucasArts, who had larger budgets and greater sales. By 1995, Legend attracted a major investment from book publisher Random House, who created a new division called Random Soft to enter the multimedia software industry. At the time, this investment secured Legend from the rising competition due to the booming interest in CD-ROM-based games. Their relationship with Random House also encouraged them to work with more of their authors, leading to the 1995 release of &quot;Shannara&quot; based on the eponymous novels by Terry Brooks. The same year, Legend released &quot;Mission Critical&quot;, which became notable for the role of Michael Dorn, of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; fame. These games were the studio&#x27;s most graphically complex thus far, but sales were not enough to offset their rising development costs. Random House decided to abandon its ventures into interactive fiction and terminated their partnership with Legend.

Both Legend founders described this period as a &quot;blessing and a curse&quot;, gaining higher graphical fidelity and simplified development on a single compact disc, but slowly watching their costs rise until their games were no longer commercially sustainable. In hindsight, Bates lamented the loss of the text interface, which removed the &quot;magic&quot; of having players see that the game recognized and rewarded surprising inputs. Meretzky also felt the shift towards graphics made the games easier and less literary, as well as more expensive.

=== Transformation and dissolution ===

In the late 1990s, Legend began seeking new partners to sustain the company, particularly game publishers. This led to new opportunities for Legend, working with publisher Take-Two Interactive for &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Crosstime Saloon&quot;, and working with Accolade for &quot;Star Control 3&quot;. The creators of the first two &quot;Star Control&quot; games had moved onto other projects, so Accolade hired Legend to create the third game because of the team&#x27;s enthusiasm for the series. As Legend was beginning to explore opportunities outside the adventure game genre, &quot;Star Control 3&quot; combined aspects of adventure, action, and strategy games. The 1996 release was considered a modest commercial success, surpassing 100,000 sales in its first two months of distribution. Legend continued to report sales of 100,000–150,000 copies for their adventure games, at a time where the future of the adventure genre was in question. However, 1997 brought the commercial failure of &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Crosstime Saloon,&quot; an adaptation of Spider Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Callahan&quot; book series that was poorly marketed by Take-Two. In 1998, Legend released a game adaptation of John Saul&#x27;s &quot;Blackstone Chronicles&quot;, which ultimately became their final adventure game release.

While the company still experienced sales growth each year, the adventure genre was being outsold by other genres. Legend shifted strategies with the rising popularity of the first-person shooter. Game developer Tim Sweeney was developing an engine that would eventually become the Unreal Engine, and Legend designer Glen Dahlgren impressed Sweeney with a vision for &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; (based on the book series). This led to a partnership with Epic Games, which led Legend to be acquired by publisher GT Interactive in 1999, as the publisher had worked with both Legend and Epic. Legend released &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; in 1999, a first-person action game that represented a major shift from their reputation for adventure games. The game enjoyed more critical than commercial success, overshadowed by other major titles in the first-person shooter genre. Bates lamented that &quot;it was hard to watch as adventure games became less popular. But it was exciting to take our expertise in storytelling and puzzle design into a whole new genre.&quot;

After a difficult year for parent company GT Interactive, they were acquired by French game company Infogrames. Legend co-founder Mike Verdu left the company in 2001, deciding he was not happy in the multi-national corporate environment. Although Bates had similar feelings, he continued with the company. Epic Games was impressed with Legend&#x27;s work on &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;″s story and their skill with the Unreal Engine, and agreed to let Legend develop the sequel to &quot;Unreal&quot;. Epic president Mark Rein announced that &quot;Unreal II&quot; was expected to be released in late 2000. However, the game&#x27;s development was fraught with challenges, and the 2003 release was met with an underwhelming reception.

&quot;Unreal II&quot; would be Legend&#x27;s final game, by which point GT Interactive had been rebranded as Infogrames, Inc., and later Atari, Inc. Legend pitched a few ideas to their parent company, conversing with Atari&#x27;s offices in New York and Infogrames&#x27;s in France. However, none of Legend&#x27;s ideas fit with the company&#x27;s corporate strategy. After shipping the &quot;Unreal II: eXpanded MultiPlayer&quot; expansion, Atari shut down Legend Entertainment on January 16, 2004. Many of the former Legend staff went on to have successful careers elsewhere in the industry. Bob Bates became the chief creative officer for Zynga, Glen Dahlgren became one of the lead designers on &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, and Mark Poesch became a developer at AOL and Accenture. Mike Verdu became an executive producer at Electronic Arts, before becoming a vice president at Facebook and later Netflix.

<text>Ma Lik, GBS, JP (; 23 February 1952 – 8 August 2007), was a Legislative Councillor, and was the Chairman of the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), a pro-Beijing political party in Hong Kong.

==Education==
Ma Lik attended the Pui Kiu Middle School. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree (with Honours) from the Department of Chinese from United College, Chinese University of Hong Kong.

==Early years==
He was born in Guangzhou and is of Xiamen, Fujian ancestry. was a teacher in the Pui Kiu Middle School, a pro-Chinese secondary school in Hong Kong. He was a deputy publisher of the &quot;Hong Kong Commercial Daily&quot; and a local Deputy to the National People&#x27;s Congress.

==Career==
Ma was formerly the Secretary General of the DAB, and became the Chairman of the DAB in December 2003 when Jasper Tsang resigned following the poor performance of the party in the November 2003 District Council elections; in those elections, the pro-democratic camp won 150 seats, while DAB secured only 62 seats out of the 205 DAB candidates fielded. Ma was re-elected leader on 25 April 2007.

Ma served in the Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee, Hong Kong Cheshire Home Foundation, and Committee on the Promotion of Civic Education. He was formerly the Chief Editor of the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, Deputy Secretary General of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee, Director of Treasure Land International Property Consultants, General Manager of The Hong Kong Institute for Promotion of Chinese Culture, and member of the Selection Committee for the First Government of HKSAR.

Ma was active in the political circles in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Ma wrote weekly and daily columns that appeared in &quot;Hong Kong Economic Times&quot;, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot;.

Ma announced in 2004, prior to standing for election to the Legislative Council, that he had been diagnosed with colon cancer.

==Death==
He left for treatment in Guangzhou soon after the Tiananmen controversy he sparked (see below). He died on 8 August 2007 at 2 pm in Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University. His body was transported back to Hong Kong on 11 August 2007. The funeral was held on 23 August. He was cremated according to his wishes.

Ma&#x27;s death precipitated the 2007 Hong Kong Island by-election, which was won by Anson Chan on 2 December 2007.

==Tiananmen Square Massacre denial furore==
On 15 May 2007, during an informal meeting Ma had with journalists to discuss political reform, Ma was asked on his views on the &quot;Tiananmen massacre&quot;. Ma caused huge furore which hit radio broadcasts, the front pages and editorials of several of the local newspapers, which cited him denying that clampdown of the protesters was a &quot;massacre&quot;.

He said of 4000 students at the scene, not everyone was killed; certain student leaders, namely Chai Ling, Wuerkaixi, Feng Chungde, and Hou Dejian, were able to leave the protest site without incident, therefore it is not a massacre. Comments which appeared to cause the most offense related to the alleged army tanks&#x27; rolling over protesters, and the PLA&#x27;s cremation of victim&#x27;s bodies on-site:

Ma questioned whether &quot;Gweilos&quot; (a racial epithet for Caucasians) should be the ones to interpret the truth about &quot;Tiananmen&quot;, and asserted that Hong Kong was &quot;not mature enough&quot;, for believing a massacre took place. Hong Kong lacked patriotism and national identity, and would thus not be ready for universal suffrage until 2022.

Ma also asked the Education Department to define massacre as events where over 4,000 were dead, which would make Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 not a massacre under the new definition. He later withdrew the redefinition request.

===Responses===
Democrats and relatives of victims all attacked Ma for his comments. Szeto Wah called Ma &quot;shameless&quot;, questioning if killings had to be on the scale of the Nanking Massacre to qualify. He said that &quot;facts written in blood cannot be twisted by lies&quot;. Democrat Cheung Man Kwong criticised the attempt at &quot;whitewash&quot;, and denounced Ma as &quot;cold-blooded&quot;. Student leader of the protest, Wang Dan, said Ma was &quot;utterly devoid of a conscience&quot;. Albert Ho said: &quot;Ma&#x27;s remarks have put salt on the open historical wounds&quot;.

Outraged by Ma&#x27;s comments, 127 &quot;Tiananmen Mothers&quot;, led by Ding Zilin, demanded a retraction and a public apology for the humiliation he has heaped on those who died.

The day after the remarks appeared in the headlines, Ma attended an RTHK radio phone-in, where he apologised for making &quot;frivolous and giddy&quot; remarks. Ma claimed he was merely trying to bring the rash claims about the number and manner of deaths reported in the foreign press into proper perspective. He admitted he had perhaps been careless with his words, and would assume full responsibility for what he said. He stopped short of apologising for his comments in general.

One DAB Vice Chairman Tam Yiu Chung defended Ma, but questioned the timing: &quot;people will understand it gradually&quot;. Fearing political fallout, another DAB Vice Chairman, Lau Kong Wah (), distanced the party from Ma, saying that Ma had expressed &quot;a personal opinion&quot;. Chan Wing-kee (), the head of ATV and CPPCC Standing Committee member declared Ma &quot;a patriot&quot; for his comments. Chan furthermore denounced the perennial Legco debate on the 4 June incident as &quot;unnecessary&quot;. Another CPPCC member, Chang Ka-mun, chimed in, saying it was &quot;irrational&quot; to compare 4 June to the Nanjing massacre.

The Central committee of the DAB declined any further action after their meeting on 22 May, stating that Vice-chairman Lau&#x27;s response was adequate. There was no formal apology.

The annual vigil in memory of Tiananmen attracted an increased turnout in 2007. An estimated 55,000 people, more than a few of whom appear to have been spurred to attend by Ma&#x27;s comments, packed Victoria Park, up from 44,000 one year earlier.

===Possible motives===
Analysts began to comment that Ma&#x27;s remarks might have been part of a concerted propaganda attempt by Beijing to dampen expectations for universal suffrage. The timing of the above statement by NPC Chairman Wu Bangguo to a NPC deputies&#x27; meeting in March 2007, is considered important, as Donald Tsang promised a green paper (consultative document) on electoral reform would be published in the summer. 

More recently, some local loyalists have issued statements pushing back the date for universal suffrage. Most notably, Cheng Yiu-tong ruled out direct elections for the Chief Executive in 2012. He further warned pro-democracy advocates that universal suffrage in 2017 was unlikely. He blamed the lack of progress on the &quot;intransigence&quot; of democrats, who blocked reform proposals put forward in December 2005. Cheng said that the electoral system would &quot;march on the spot again in 2012&quot;.

==Other controversies==

===Anti-RTHK===
On 20 October 1999 the pro-Beijing group fiercely attacked Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK). Ma Lik publicly attacked RTHK from changing the role from a &quot;watchdog&quot; to a &quot;mouthpiece&quot; of the Hong Kong government.

===Criticising Hong Kong===
Ma Lik criticised the rate at which Hong Kong is moving. And that it would take until 2022 for the public to have acquired enough patriotism to accept Communist party rule.

<text>Sir William Snow Harris (1 April 1791 – 22 January 1867) was a British physician and electrical researcher, nicknamed Thunder-and-Lightning Harris, and noted for his invention of a successful system of lightning conductors for ships. It took many years of campaigning, research and successful testing before the British Royal Navy changed to Harris&#x27;s conductors from their previous less effective system. One of the successful test vessels was which survived lightning strikes unharmed on her famous voyage with Charles Darwin.
==Life and work==
Harris was born in Plymouth on 1 April 1791. His family was well established as solicitors in the town, and he went to Plymouth Grammar School. His childhood in the seaport which included the naval dockyard renamed Devonport gave him an enduring interest in ships.

He went to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine and qualified as a physician, then returned to Plymouth and set up a medical practice. His interest in the emerging science of electricity led him to invent his improved lightning conductor for ships in 1820. In 1824 he married, and decided to abandon his profession of medicine to concentrate on his studies of electricity. His paper &quot;On the Relative Powers of various Metallic Substances as Conductors of Electricity&quot;, read before the Royal Society in 1826, led to him being elected a fellow of the society in 1831. He read papers on the elementary laws of electricity to the Society in 1834, 1836 and 1839, and also sent accounts of his experiments and discoveries to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His experimental investigations into the force of high intensity electricity were published in the Philosophical Transactions of 1834. In 1835 Harris received the Royal Society&#x27;s Copley Medal for his &quot;Experimental Investigations of the Forces of Electricity of high Intensity&quot;.

Harris was curator of apparatus in the museum of The Plymouth Institution (now The Plymouth Athenaeum) and held the office of President twice.

His work on lightning conductors for ships gained him a government annuity of £300 &quot;in consideration of services in the cultivation of science&quot;, and to overcome continued objections to his proposals he published an 1843 work on &quot;Thunderstorms&quot;, as well as contributing papers to &quot;The Nautical Magazine&quot; on lightning damage. He was knighted in 1847 after the system had been adopted and shown successful, and was given a grant of £5,000. Though his continued research did not find new discoveries, his manuals of &quot;Electricity, Galvanism and Magnetism&quot; were published between 1848 and 1856 and went through several editions. When he died in Plymouth on 22 January 1867 he had a &quot;Treatise on Frictional Electricity&quot; in preparation, and it was published later that year.

==Lightning conductor for ships==
The lightning rod invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752 suggested a way of avoiding the common problem of lightning causing damage to the wooden sailing ships of the period. In Britain, the Royal Navy chose a protection system with a chain draped into the sea from the top of the mast as a lightning conductor. This system proved unsatisfactory: the chain was only supposed to be raised up the mast when lightning was anticipated, and lightning often struck unexpectedly. When the chain was raised it was a nuisance to seamen aloft in the rigging to deal with the square rigged sails, and even when it was raised, lightning strokes would sometimes damage the chain or the ship. There were also fears that the conductors would attract lightning to the ship, and prejudices against their use. The French navy devised a modified system in which the chain was led down the permanent rigging to connect to the copper sheathing which was used to protect the hull below the waterline against damage from collisions and shipworms. In the early 19th century they replaced the chains by metal cables.

Harris invented a new system in 1820, with lightning conductor plates fixed along spars and down the aft side of the mast, right down through the hull to connect to the copper sheathing of the hull. All the principal metallic masses in the ship were to be bonded to the conductor to ensure that there were no side flashes. He proposed this system to the Admiralty in 1821 but found them unresponsive to his proposals, and he campaigned to persuade the Navy to test his system, and to publicise the extent of the problem. They agreed to test the system on eleven vessels, starting in 1830.

===Trials on HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;===
One of the first vessels outfitted for the test was , which had returned from its first survey voyage to South America, and was extensively rebuilt and refitted for the second survey voyage. As part of this work, &quot;lightning-conductors, invented by Mr. Harris, were fixed in all the masts, the bowsprit, and even in the flying jib-boom.&quot; The captain, Robert FitzRoy, had been given command in the middle of the first expedition after the previous captain committed suicide. Before being given that command, FitzRoy had been a lieutenant on board HMS &quot;Thetis&quot; in Rio harbour when her foremast was struck by lightning. The &quot;fore-topmast was shivered into a mere collection of splinters&quot; and the foremast irreparably damaged, delaying the ship for almost two months while &quot;the foremast was taken out afterwards, and replaced by another, purchased from the Brazilian government at a great expense.&quot;

Near the end of 1831, while the &quot;Beagle&quot; was still being fitted out at Devonport in preparation for sailing, the recently graduated Charles Darwin arrived in Plymouth to take up the opportunity of sailing on the ship as a self-funded gentleman naturalist who would be a companion to the captain while the ship was at sea, and who would make his own expeditions inland while the ship&#x27;s crew was surveying the coasts. He told his sister that he had &quot;breakfasted yesterday with a Mr. Harris whom I like more than anybody I have seen.— He has written a great deal on Electricity&quot;, and wrote to tell his university tutor John Stevens Henslow about his progress, noting that he had met &quot;one or two pleasant people, foremost of whom is Mr. Thunder &amp; Lightning Harris, whom I daresay you have heard of.&quot; In his diary he noted that on the evening of 21 November he attended a &quot;popular lecture from Mr Harris on his lightning conductors&quot; at the Athenaeum. Harris used an &quot;Electric machine&quot; for a thunder cloud and a tub of water for the sea, then with &quot;a toy for a line of battle ship he showed the whole process of it being struck by lightning &amp; most satisfactorily proved how completely his plan protects the vessel from any bad consequences. This plan consists in having plates of Copper folding over each other, let in the masts &amp; yards &amp; so connected to the water beneath. — The principle, from which these advantages are derived, owes its utility, to the fact that the Electric fluid is weakened by being transmitted over a large surface to such an extent that no effects are perceived, even when the mast is struck by the lightning. — The Beagle is fitted with conductors on this plan; it is very probable, we shall be the means of trying &amp; I hope proving the utility of its effects.&quot;

The voyage took almost five years, and although the &quot;Beagle&quot; was frequently exposed to lightning and was thought to have been struck by lightning on at least two occasions, &quot;when—at the instant of a vivid flash of lightning, accompanied by a crashing peal of thunder—a hissing sound was heard on the masts; and a strange, though very slightly tremulous, motion in the ship indicated that something unusual had happened&quot;, there was never the &quot;slightest damage&quot;. Darwin himself reported this effect, and his conviction that &quot;but for the conductor, the results would have been serious.&quot; FitzRoy reported that the copper plates stayed firmly in place, even in small spars, and strengthened the spars rather than weakening them. FitzRoy gave the lightning protection high praise: 
===Naval adoption of the Harris conductors===
Harris continued his extensive campaign to publicise the extent of the problem of lightning damage. He presented a report listing the damage caused to British naval vessels during the period from 1793 to 1838, including lightning causing 62 deaths and 114 injuries. Two study committees gave favourable recommendations for his system, but full implementation continued to be blocked by the opposition of the First Sea Lord until a change of government led to him being replaced by a new First Sea Lord late in 1841. In June 1842 the Royal Navy at last adopted the Harris conductors. By then the Imperial Russian Navy had already adopted Harris&#x27;s invention, and in 1845 the Tsar presented him with a valuable ring and vase, in acknowledgment of his services.

Harris continued to record the effects of lightning on ships of the Royal Navy, and published details of this research. In 1853 a report in &quot;The Nautical Magazine&quot; proudly stated that between 1830 and 1846 none of the ships protected by Harris conductors had suffered casualties from lightning, and they had not been struck by lightning to nearly the extent that unprotected ships had been. Taking a comparable period, at least 45 unprotected ships had been terribly damaged by lightning. It reflected on the boldness of leading the conductors down through the ship past crowded areas and combustible materials, and the prejudices the scheme had to overcome. It noted that the measure was founded on sound principles of science, and had been backed by eminent scientists including Sir Humphry Davy. Recalling the earlier opposition to Harris&#x27;s proposals, it concluded with &quot;feelings of satisfaction approaching to exultation at the complete success which has crowned his exertions&quot;.

<text>SS &quot;Californian&quot; was a British Leyland Line steamship. She is thought to have been the only ship in sight of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, or at least her rockets, during that ship&#x27;s sinking. The crew took no action to assist.

The United States Senate inquiry and British Wreck Commissioner&#x27;s inquiry into the sinking both concluded that many or all of the lives lost could have been saved, had &quot;Californian&quot; responded promptly to the&quot; Titanic&quot; distress rockets. The U.S. Senate inquiry was particularly critical of the vessel&#x27;s captain, Stanley Lord, calling his inaction during the disaster &quot;reprehensible&quot;.

Despite this criticism, no formal charges were ever brought against Lord or his crew. Lord disputed the findings and spent the rest of his life trying to clear his name. In 1992, the UK Government&#x27;s Marine Accident Investigation Branch re-examined the case and while condemning Lord&#x27;s inaction, held that due to the limited time available, &quot;the effect of &quot;Californian&quot; taking proper action would have been no more than to place on her the task actually carried out by , that is the rescue of those who escaped... [no] reasonably probable action by Captain Lord could have led to a different outcome of the tragedy&quot;.

&quot;Californian&quot; was sunk in the Eastern Mediterranean during World War I on 9 November 1915 by the German submarines and , while serving as a transport ship.

==Construction and early career==

&quot;Californian&quot; was a steamship owned by the Leyland Line, part of J.P. Morgan&#x27;s International Mercantile Marine Co. She was constructed by the Caledon Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company in Dundee, Scotland, and was the largest ship built in Dundee up to that time. The ship was built to the maximum dimensions that were allowed to moor and outfit her in the Dundee Docks. The ship&#x27;s size and importance to the local shipbuilding industry meant that there was a lot of local interest in her construction as it progressed. There were also some problems – when both of the ship&#x27;s boilers were being transported through the streets from a foundry to the shipyard the weight of them (carried on a wheeled bogie) caused considerable damage to the city&#x27;s roads, as well as breaking a number of underground water pipes. Later when a crane was being used to rig a spar on one of the &quot;Californian&quot; four masts, the spar became tangled in nearby telephone wires and severed them.

She was designed primarily to transport cotton, but also had the capacity to carry 47 passengers and 55 crew members. The primary clientele was those passengers with too limited the means to travel on board large liners. By offering them comfortable cabins at an affordable prices (£10 per crossing in the direction Liverpool — Boston, £50 in the opposite direction), Leyland Line was able to secure some profits this way. Nonetheless, the ship was still primarily a freighter, as evidenced by her massive bunkers. She was named &quot;Californian&quot; according to a tradition specific to the company which gave its ships the name of one of the 46 states of the United States at the time. She measured 6,223 tons, was long, at her beam, and had a triple expansion steam engine powered by two double-ended boilers. Her average full speed was .
The accommodation of most of the fifty or so crew members was located below the foredeck. They stayed there in cabins designed for four to eight people that were quite uncomfortable, poorly ventilated and lit. In all, the crew included the captain, four officers, a radio operator, and 49 crew members (sailors, drivers, trimmers, etc.). The cabins were located in the superstructure. The officers of the crew resided on the starboard side and the passengers on the port side. The facilities for passengers corresponded to the second class of most ships of the time. Although the cabins were not of high quality, they remained comfortable and had electric lighting, which was not the case on all contemporary ships. The passengers of the &quot;Californian&quot; also had at their disposal a smoking room on the upper starboard deck, decorated with oak panels and linoleum, a novelty at the turn of the century. The dining room was also decorated and comfortable.

&quot;Californian&quot; was launched on 26 November 1901 and completed her sea trials on 23 January 1902. From 31 January 1902 to 3 March 1902, she made her maiden voyage from Dundee to New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Subsequently, she made transatlantic crossings, generally carrying around thirty passengers in addition to her cargo. In 1902, she was chartered by the Dominion Line for five crossings to Portland, Maine. She then returned to the Leyland Line service to serve the southern United States. From 1901 to 1911, she was commanded successively by four captains before being finally put under the command of Stanley Lord.

Between late 1911 and early 1912, &quot;Californian&quot; had a Marconi wireless apparatus installed in a refitted cabin. Her first radio operator was Cyril Furmstone Evans.

==Sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot;==

On March 30, 1912, the &quot;Californian&quot; made a stopover in London on a trip to New Orleans during which she had to face a storm which damaged part of her cotton cargo. Stanley Lord, who had commanded &quot;Californian&quot; since 27 March 1911, was her captain when she left the Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool, England on 5 April 1912 on her way to Boston, Massachusetts. She was not carrying any passengers on this voyage. On the navigation bridge, Lord was accompanied by three officers and an apprentice: George Stewart (second in command or chief officer), Herbert Stone (second officer), Charles Groves (third officer) and apprentice James Gibson.

The first week of the crossing was uneventful. On Sunday 14 April at 18:30 ship&#x27;s time, &quot;Californian&quot; only wireless operator, Cyril Furmstone Evans (born 1892 in Croydon, Surrey, United Kingdom), signalled to the &quot;Antillian&quot; that three large icebergs were five miles to the south. &quot;Titanic&quot; wireless operator Harold Bride also received the warning and delivered it to the ship&#x27;s bridge a few minutes later.

&quot;Californian&quot; encountered a large ice field at 22:20 ship&#x27;s time, and Captain Lord decided to stop the ship and wait until morning before proceeding further. Before leaving the bridge, he thought he saw a ship&#x27;s light away to the eastward but could not be sure it was not just a rising star. Lord continued to the engineers&#x27; cabins and met with the chief, whom he told about his plans for stopping. As they were talking, they saw a ship&#x27;s lights approaching. Lord asked Evans if he knew of any ships in the area, and Evans responded: &quot;only the &quot;Titanic&quot;.&quot; Lord asked Evans to inform her that &quot;Californian&quot; was stopped and surrounded by ice. Lord ordered Evans to warn all other ships in the area, which he did.

&quot;Titanic&quot; on-duty wireless operator, Jack Phillips, was busy clearing a backlog of passengers&#x27; messages with the wireless station at Cape Race, Newfoundland, away, at the time. Evans&#x27;s message that SS &quot;Californian&quot; was stopped and surrounded by ice was heard very strongly on &quot;Titanic&quot; due to the relative proximity of the two ships and drowned out a separate message Phillips had been in the process of receiving from Cape Race, bringing Phillips told Evans to stop transmitting in the straight diction of wireless operators: &quot;Keep out. Shut up; I am working Cape Race.&quot; (or, in morse code, &quot;DDD&quot;). Contrary to belief, Evans was not offended nor took the common code for &quot;stop transmitting&quot; to be an insult. Instead, he listened in for a while before he switched off his wireless equipment and went to bed. A few minutes later, at 23:40, &quot;Titanic&quot; hit an iceberg. Shortly after midnight, she transmitted her first distress call.

Third Officer Charles Groves of the &quot;Californian&quot; testified to the British inquiry that at 23:10 ship&#x27;s time, he had seen the lights of another ship come into view 10 or 12 miles away, 3.5 points above &quot;Californian&quot; starboard beam. At about 23:30, Groves went below to inform Lord. The latter suggested that the ship be contacted by Morse lamp, which was tried, but no reply was seen. To Groves, she was clearly a large liner, as she had multiple decks brightly lit. The ship finally seemed to stop and extinguish her deck lights at 23:40, the same time &quot;Titanic&quot; stopped her engines. At the British inquiry, Groves agreed that if the ship he saw had turned two points to port, it would have concealed her deck lights.

Slightly after midnight, Second Officer Herbert Stone took watch from Groves. He testified that he, too, observed the ship, judging it to be about five miles away. He tried signalling her with the Morse lamp, also without success. Apprentice officer James Gibson, who had been doing the Morse signalling, testified that at 00:55, Stone told him he had observed five rockets in the sky above the nearby ship. Stone testified that he had informed Captain Lord, although the British inquiry did not ask whether or not he communicated the number. Lord asked if the rockets had been a company signal, but Stone did not know. Lord and Stone both testified that Stone reported they were not distress signals. Lord ordered Stone to tell him if anything about the ship changed, to keep signalling it with the Morse lamp, but did not order that it be contacted by wireless.

Gibson testified that Stone had expressed unease to him about the situation: &quot;A ship is not going to fire rockets at sea for nothing&quot;, Stone said. &quot;She looks very queer out of the water—her lights look queer.&quot; Gibson observed, &quot;She looks rather to have a big side out of the water&quot;, and he agreed that &quot;everything was not all right with her&quot;; that it was &quot;a case of some kind of distress&quot;. Stone, however, under increasingly incredulous questioning by the British inquiry, testified repeatedly that he did not think at the time that the rockets could have been distress signals, and that the possibility did not occur to him until he learned the &quot;Titanic&quot; had sunk.

By 02:00, the ship appeared to be leaving the area. A few minutes later, Gibson informed Captain Lord as such and that eight white rockets had been seen. Lord asked whether he was sure of the colour. Gibson said yes and left.

At 02:20, &quot;Titanic&quot; sank. At 03:40, Stone and Gibson, still sharing the middle watch, spotted rockets to the south. They did not see the ship that was firing them, but at about this same time RMS &quot;Carpathia&quot; was coming quickly from the southeast, firing rockets to let &quot;Titanic&quot; know that help was on the way. At 04:16, Chief Officer George F. Stewart relieved Stone, and almost immediately noticed, coming into view from the south, a brilliantly-lit, four-masted steamship with one funnel; &quot;Carpathia&quot; arrived on the scene shortly after 04:00.
Captain Lord woke up at 04:30 and went out on deck to decide how to proceed past the ice to the west. He sent Stewart to wake Evans and find out what happened to the ship they had seen to the south. They subsequently learned from the &quot;Frankfurt&quot; that the &quot;Titanic&quot; had sunk overnight. Lord ordered the ship underway. &quot;Californian&quot; course took her west, slowly passing through the ice field, after which she turned south. &quot;Californian&quot; was sighted at 06:00 by steaming from the north. &quot;Californian&quot; actually passed the &quot;Carpathia&quot; to the west, then turned, and headed northeast back towards the rescue ship, arriving at 08:30.

&quot;Carpathia&quot; was just finishing picking up the last of &quot;Titanic&quot; survivors. After communicating with &quot;Californian&quot;, &quot;Carpathia&quot; left the area, leaving &quot;Californian&quot; to search for any other survivors. However, &quot;Californian&quot; only found scattered wreckage, empty lifeboats, and corpses, and continued on its route to America. Upon arrival, several key crew members, including Lord and Evans, were summoned to give evidence at the American inquiry. Evans also gave evidence at the British inquiry into the tragedy. Like others involved in the disaster, he was offered large sums of money from newspapers for his story, but he refused it.

===Aftermath===
A United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; started on 19 April 1912, the day &quot;Californian&quot; arrived unnoticed in Boston. Initially, the world was unaware of her proximity to the disaster. On 22 April, the inquiry discovered that a ship near &quot;Titanic&quot;, whose identity then was unknown, had failed to respond to the distress signals.

The next day, a small newspaper in New England, &quot;The Clinton Daily Item&quot;, printed a story claiming that &quot;Californian&quot; had refused aid to &quot;Titanic&quot;. The source for the story was &quot;Californian&quot; carpenter, James McGregor, who stated that he had seen &quot;Titanic&quot; lights and distress rockets. On the same day, the &quot;Boston American&quot; printed a story sourced by &quot;Californian&quot;″s assistant engineer, Ernest Gill, with essentially the same account.

Captain Lord also spoke with several Boston area newspapers but gave conflicting accounts. In a &quot;Boston Traveller&quot; article dated 19 April, Lord claimed that his ship was 30 miles from &quot;Titanic&quot;, but in a &quot;Boston Post&quot; article dated 24 April, he claimed 20 miles. Lord told the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; that his ship had spent three hours steaming around the wreck site trying to render assistance, but Third Officer Grove later stated that the search ended after two hours, at 10:40. When reporters asked Lord about his exact position the night of the disaster, he refused to respond, calling such information &quot;state secrets&quot;.

After the newspaper revelations on 23 April, the U.S. Senate inquiry issued subpoenas for multiple members of the crew, including Gill and Lord. During his testimony, Gill repeated his claims. Lord&#x27;s testimony was conflicting and changing. He detailed three different ice conditions; he admitted knowing about the rockets, despite having told Boston newspapers that his ship had not seen any rockets, but insisted that they were not distress rockets. He also asserted they were fired not from &quot;Titanic&quot; but a small steamship, the so-called &quot;third ship&quot; of the night. Yet the testimony of Captain J. Knapp, U.S. Navy, and a part of the Navy Hydrographer&#x27;s Office, made clear that &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Californian&quot; were in sight of each other, and no third vessel had been in the area.

The issue of &quot;Californian&quot;&#x27;s so-called &quot;scrap log&quot; was also scrutinised; the unofficial log from which the information in the official log is drawn, having been approved by the captain. Company policy of International Mercantile Marine Co., the parent of both Leyland Line and the White Star Line, required scrap logs to be destroyed daily. The official log mentioned neither a nearby ship nor rockets. At the British inquiry, Stone was not asked to recall the notations he had actually written in the scrap log, during his bridge-watch between midnight and 4:00 on 15 April.

On 2 May, the British Wreck Commissioner&#x27;s inquiry into the sinking of the Titanic began. Again, Lord gave conflicting, inconsistent, and evasive testimony. The crew of &quot;Californian&quot; also gave conflicting testimonies. Most notably, Lord said he was not told that the nearby ship had disappeared, contradicting James Gibson, who testified he had reported it to Lord, who had acknowledged him.

By contrast, Captain Arthur Rostron of &quot;Carpathia&quot;, at each inquiry, gave consistent and forthright testimony. During the British Inquiry, Rostron was asked to confirm an affidavit he had made to the United States Inquiry. Among the other things in his affidavit, he confirmed that &quot;It was daylight at about 4.20 a.m. At 5 o&#x27;clock it was light enough to see all around the horizon. We then saw two steamships to the northwards, perhaps 7 or 8 miles distant. Neither of them was &quot;Californian&quot;.&quot;

Also during the inquiries, &quot;Titanic&quot; survivors recalled seeing the lights of another ship after &quot;Titanic&quot; had hit the iceberg. To &quot;Titanic&quot;″s Fourth Officer Boxhall, the other ship appeared to be off &quot;Titanic&quot;″s bow, five miles (8 km) away and heading in her direction. Just like &quot;Californian&quot; officers, Boxhall attempted signaling the ship with a Morse lamp, but received no response. However, &quot;Titanic&quot; lookout Frederick Fleet, who was in the crow&#x27;s nest when the iceberg was sighted and remained there for another forty minutes, testified at the US inquiry that he did not see the lights of another ship while in the crow&#x27;s nest. He only saw a light later after leaving the ship on a lifeboat.

&quot;Titanic&quot;″s Captain Edward Smith had felt the ship was close enough that he ordered the first lifeboats launched on the port side to row over to the ship, drop off the passengers, and come back to &quot;Titanic&quot; for more. Moreover, lifeboat occupants reported the other ship&#x27;s lights were seen from the lifeboats throughout the night; one lifeboat rowed towards them but never seemed to get any closer.

Both the American and British inquires found that &quot;Californian&quot; must have been closer than the claimed by Captain Lord, and that each ship was visible from the other. Indeed, when &quot;Carpathia&quot; arrived at the wreck site, a vessel was clearly seen to the north; this was later identified as &quot;Californian&quot;. Both inquiries concluded that Captain Lord had failed to provide proper assistance to &quot;Titanic&quot;, the British Inquiry concluding that had &quot;Californian&quot; rendering assistance &quot;… might have saved many if not all of the lives that were lost&quot;.

In the months and years following the disaster, numerous preventive safety measures were enacted. The United States passed the Radio Act of 1912, which required 24-hour radio watch on all ships in case of an emergency. The first International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea formed a treaty that also required 24-hour radio monitoring and standardized the use of distress rockets.

Despite the criticisms of Lord&#x27;s conduct, no formal charges were ever brought against him. As a result, he had no right of appeal against the inquiry&#x27;s findings. The issue was not considered again until the publication of Walter Lord&#x27;s (unrelated to Captain Lord) book &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; in 1955 and the release of the 1958 film of the same name prompted Lord to seek a re-hearing of the inquiry relating to his ship, to counter the allegations made in the book and his portrayal in the film. Petitions presented to the UK Government in 1965 and 1968 by the Mercantile Marine Service Association (MMSA), a union to which Captain Lord belonged, failed to get the matter re-examined. However, when the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot; was discovered by Ballard&#x27;s expedition in 1985, it was found to be 13 miles from its reported position (the location accepted by both inquiries), so the Board of Trade ordered a re-examination.

The British Government&#x27;s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) concluded its reappraisal of evidence in 1992. The conclusions were those of Deputy Chief Inspector, James de Coverly, stating: &quot;What is significant, however, is that no ship was seen by the &quot;Titanic&quot; until well after the collision… watch was maintained with officers on the bridge and seamen in the crow&#x27;s nest, and with their ship in grave danger the lookout for another vessel which could come to their help must have been most anxious and keen. It is in my view inconceivable that the &quot;Californian&quot; or any other ship was within the visible horizon of the &quot;Titanic&quot; during that period; it equally follows that the &quot;Titanic&quot; can&#x27;t have been within the &quot;Californian&#x27;s&quot; horizon.&quot; The report went on: &quot;More probably, in my view, the ship seen by &quot;Californian&quot; was another, unidentified, vessel.&quot;

The original investigator of the 1992 reappraisal was a Captain Barnett, who unlike de Coverly, concluded &quot;that the &quot;Titanic&quot; &quot;was&quot; seen by the &quot;Californian&quot; and indeed kept under observation from 23:00 or soon after on 14 April until she sank... [based on] the evidence from Captain Lord and the two watch officers, Mr. Grove and Mr. Stone&quot;. It was after Barnett&#x27;s original report was submitted that Captain de Coverly was given the task of further examination. Both Barnett and de Coverly had concluded that &quot;Titanic&quot; rockets had been seen and that Stone and Lord had not responded appropriately to signals of distress.

The 1992 MAIB report concluded that Captain Lord and his crew&#x27;s actions &quot;fell far short of what was needed,&quot; but conceded that absent this, &quot;Californian&quot; could not have arrived on the scene until &quot;well after the sinking&quot;. It also noted that when he did know of &quot;Titanic&quot; distress, Lord twice took his ship across an ice field to help search for survivors. Captain Lord&#x27;s chief defender, union attorney Leslie Harrison, who had led the fight to have the &quot;Californian&quot; incident re-examined by the British government, called the dual conclusions of the report &quot;an admission of failure to achieve the purpose of the reappraisal&quot;.

The 1992 report by the MAIB was published just months after their publication of another controversial report, on the subject of the &quot;Marchioness&quot; disaster of 1989. This report had led to questions over the evidence-gathering, conduct and judgements of the MAIB.

Author Paul Lee accused Captain Lord of an &quot;inability or unwillingness to adjust to an entirely new situation&quot;. Although Lord had stopped his ship upon encountering ice, the British inquiry concluded that if &quot;Californian&quot; had acted upon the rockets and pushed through the ice, the &quot;Californian&quot; &quot;might have saved many, if not all, of the lives that were lost&quot;. The U.S Senate inquiry was also critical of Lord&#x27;s inaction, the final report stating that &quot;such conduct, whether arising from indifference or gross carelessness, is most reprehensible, and places upon the commander the &quot;Californian&quot; a grave responsibility&quot;.

Senator William Alden Smith, in a speech to the U.S. Senate inquiry, said: &quot;the failure of Capt. Lord to arouse the wireless operator on his ship, who could have easily ascertained the name of the vessel in distress and reached her in time to avert loss of life, places a tremendous responsibility upon this officer from which it will be very difficult for him to escape&quot;. Author Daniel Allen Butler wrote: &quot;The crime of Stanley Lord was not that he may have ignored the &quot;Titanic&#x27;s&quot; rockets, but that he unquestionably ignored &quot;someone&#x27;s&quot; cry for help.&quot;

Others have suggested that, considering all the circumstances, there was actually little if anything the &quot;Californian&quot; could have done to prevent or reduce the loss of life. Allegations have been made that trade unions defending Captain Lord succeeded in influencing the reports from the official investigations before they were available to the public. Williams and Kamps wrote in &quot;Titanic and the Californian&quot;: &quot;Bearing [the] distance in mind, and recalling that a mere fifty-five minutes had elapsed from the time Captain Lord was first informed about the rockets to the moment the &quot;Titanic&quot; slipped beneath the waves, it would have been nothing short of a miracle for Lord to bring his ship to the &quot;Titanic&quot; and effect a rescue in such a short space of time.&quot;

&quot;Titanic&quot; historian Tim Maltin theorized that the &quot;Californian&quot;&#x27;s inaction was the result of a cold water mirage, or superior mirage, arising from differences in air temperature over the warmer waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the colder waters of the Labrador Current. Maltin suggested that this would cause a superior refraction, superimposing and stretching and distorting the edge of the sea and lifting images of objects, distorting their appearance. This would explain why the &quot;Titanic&quot; Morse lamp was believed to be a flickering oil lamp on the mast of a much smaller ship, and why Capt. Lord thought the &quot;Titanic&quot; was a different vessel. If correct, Maltin&#x27;s theory may further explain why the &quot;Titanic&quot; lookouts did not spot the iceberg earlier.

Cyril Evans continued his service with the Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company and its successor companies (Eastern Telegraph Company and Cable &amp; Wireless: the later part of his career was spent as manager for Cable and Wireless on the West Indian island of St Lucia) for the rest of his life. He also served at sea in World War I and World War II, running mobile telecommunications for the British Army in North Africa and then Italy. He married and raised a family. In the film &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, Evans was portrayed by Geoffrey Bayldon.

==Later career and sinking==
On 2 July 1913, &quot;Californian&quot; was docked in Veracruz when a fire erupted in her 3 and 4 holds, sustaining serious damage to herself and her cargo.

&quot;Californian&quot; continued in normal commercial service until World War I, when the British government took control of her. She was responsible for transporting equipments and troops for the Allies mired in the Battle of Gallipoli.

At 07:45 on 9 November 1915, while en route from Salonica to Marseilles at a speed of 12 knots, with a French torpedo boat escort, she was torpedoed by the German U-boat . The escort tried to take her under tow, but the tow rope broke at 13:20. During a second attempt at 14:15, she was torpedoed again by sister and began to sink quickly. The crew evacuated onto the patrol boat, and finally &quot;Californian&quot; sank in 10–13,000 feet of water, approximately south-southwest of Cape Matapan, Greece. Fireman Richard John Harding was killed during the first torpedo attack, and two other firemen were scalded. To date, &quot;Californian&quot;″s wreck remains undiscovered. &quot;Californian&quot; sunk less than from where , a sister ship to Titanic, would sink only a little over a year later by striking a mine laid by German SM U-73.

==In popular culture==
The involvement of the &quot;Californian&quot; in the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; is examined in the 2012 BBC TV drama &quot;SOS&quot;&quot;The Titanic Inquiry&quot;. The drama tells the story of the original British Inquiry into the sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot;, which decided, using the facts that were available at the time, whether the &quot;Californian&quot; was in near enough proximity to the vessel to rescue some, if not all, of the 1,500 lives lost.

The 2016 novel &quot;The Midnight Watch&quot; by David Dyer explores the &quot;Titanic&quot; tragedy from the perspective of the crew of the &quot;Californian.&quot; The narrative centres around a fictional American reporter who tries to uncover what really happened on board the &quot;Californian&quot; that fateful night.

<text>The former Tsui Museum of Art in Hong Kong housed a privately owned collection.

==History==

Hong Kong businessman T.T. Tsui began collecting antiques in the 1970s, featuring rotating exhibits from the 3,000-piece collection. Formerly located in the old Bank of China building, the museum had moved to Henley Building, at 5 Queen&#x27;s Road, Central prior to its closing in the late 1990s.

Chinese ceramics ranging from the painted pottery of the Neolithic period to the porcelain of the Qing dynasty formed the collection&#x27;s cornerstone. In addition, the scope of the Tsui Museum encompassed bronzes; bamboo, wood and ivory carvings; jade, enamelled ware, glass, furniture, Han dynasty tomb statues.

Mr. Tsui has also founded the Tsui Art Foundation, and loaned a part of his collection to the University Museum and Art Gallery, Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Heritage Museum and has made donations to galleries in Australia, England and the United States.

<doc id="395918" wikidata="Q691152" url="?curid=395918" title="Royal Geographical Society">
<text>The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers), often shortened to RGS, is a learned society and professional body for geography based in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1830 for the advancement of geographical sciences, the society has 16,000 members, with its work reaching the public through publications, research groups and lectures.

The RGS was founded in 1830 under the name &quot;Geographical Society of London&quot; as an institution to promote the &#x27;advancement of geographical science&#x27;. It later absorbed the older African Association, which had been founded by Sir Joseph Banks in 1788, as well as the Raleigh Club and the Palestine Association. In 1995 it merged with the Institute of British Geographers, a body for academic geographers, to become officially the Royal Geographical Society &quot;with IBG&quot;.

The society is governed by its council, which is chaired by the society&#x27;s president, according to a set of statutes and standing orders. The members of council and the president are elected from and by its fellows, who are allowed to use the postnominal title FRGS. As a chartered body, the RGS holds the Register of Chartered Geographers in the public interest, a source of qualified, practising and experienced professional geographers. Fellows may apply for chartership if they fulfil the criteria.

==History==
The RGS was founded on 16 July 1830 under the name &quot;Geographical Society of London&quot; as an institution to promote the &#x27;advancement of geographical science&#x27;. The seven founding members of the society were Sir John Barrow (geographer), Sir Roderick Murchison (geologist), Robert Brown (botanist), Lord Broughton (politician), Mountstuart Elphinstone (colonial administrator), Bartholomew Frere (diplomat) and William Henry Smyth (Admiral). The first President of the Society was the former Prime Minister Viscount Goderich and the first Secretary Alexander Maconochie (who became the first professor of Geography at the University College London), with another notable council member being Sir Francis Beaufort. Like many learned societies, it had started as a dining club in London, where select members held informal dinner debates on current scientific issues and ideas. It later absorbed the older African Association, which had been founded by Sir Joseph Banks in 1788, as well as the Raleigh Club and the Palestine Association.

From 1830 to 1840 the RGS met in the rooms of the Horticultural Society in Regent Street, London and from 1854 -1870 at 15 Whitehall Place, London. In 1870, the society finally found a home when it moved to 1 Savile Row, London. The society also used briefly a lecture theatre in Burlington Gardens, London which was lent to it by the Civil Service Commission. 

Under the patronage of King William IV it later became known as the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) and was granted its royal charter under Queen Victoria in 1859. Another notable early member was Sir John Franklin.

A new impetus was given to the society&#x27;s affairs in 1911, with the election of Earl Curzon, the former Viceroy of India, as the society&#x27;s President (1911–1914). The premises in Savile Row (once described by Curzon as &quot;cramped and rather squalid&quot;) were sold and the present site, Lowther Lodge in Kensington Gore, was purchased for £100,000 and opened for use in April 1913. In the same year the society&#x27;s ban on women fellows was lifted.

Lowther Lodge was built in 1874 for the William Lowther by Norman Shaw, one of the most outstanding domestic architects of his day. Extensions to the east wing were added in 1929, and included the New Map Room and the 750 seat Lecture Theatre. The extension was formally opened by the Duke of York (later King George VI) at the RGS centenary celebrations on 21 October 1930.

The history of the society was closely allied for many of its earlier years with &#x27;colonial&#x27; exploration in Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the polar regions, and central Asia especially.

It has been a key associate and supporter of many notable explorers and expeditions, including those of Darwin, Livingstone, Stanley, Scott, Shackleton, Hunt and Hillary.

The early history of the society is inter-linked with the history of British geography, exploration and discovery. Information, maps, charts and knowledge gathered on expeditions was sent to the RGS, making up its now unique geographical collections. The society published its first journal in 1831 and from 1855, accounts of meetings and other matters were published in the society proceedings. In 1893, this was replaced by &quot;The Geographical Journal&quot; which is still published today.

The society was also pivotal in establishing geography as a teaching and research discipline in British universities, and funded the first geography positions in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
With the advent of a more systematic study of geography, the &quot;Institute of British Geographers&quot; (IBG) was formed in 1933, by thirteen geographers including Hilda Ormsby, Andrew Charles O&#x27;Dell, as the RGS was seen as too focused on exploration. IBG activities included organising conferences, field trips, seminars, and specialist research groups and publishing a journal, &quot;Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers&quot;. The RGS and IBG co-existed for 60 years until 1992 when a merger was discussed. In 1994, members were balloted and the merger agreed. In January 1995, the new Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) was formed.

The society also works together with other existing bodies serving the geographical community, in particular the Geographical Association and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society.

In 2004, the RGS&#x27;s historical collections relating to scientific exploration and research, which are of national and international importance, were opened to the public for the first time. In the same year, a new category of membership was introduced to widen access for people with a general interest in geography. The new Foyle Reading Room and glass Pavilion exhibition space were also opened to the public in 2004. For example, in 2012 the RGS held an exhibition, in the glass Pavilion, of photographs taken by Herbert Ponting on Captain Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s expedition to the South Pole in 1912.

== Governance ==

=== Council ===
The society is governed by its board of trustees called the council, which is chaired by its president. The members of council and the president are elected from its fellowship. The council consists of 36 members, 22 of which are elected by fellows and serve for a three-year term. In addition to the elected trustees, there are honorary members—who include the Duke of Kent as honorary president—who sit on the council.

The society has five specialist committees that it derives advice from: the Education Committee, Research Committee, Expedition and Fieldwork Committee, Information Resources Committee, and the Finance Committee.

===Presidents===
==Membership==
There are four categories of individual membership:

===Membership===
Anyone with an interest in geography is eligible to apply to become a member of the RGS-IBG.

===Student Membership===
Students who are studying geography (or an allied subject) at GCSE, A Level or as an undergraduate (or at equivalent levels).

===Associate Fellowship===
This status is available by application from postgraduate students &quot;or&quot; those within five years of graduating from their first degree.

===Fellowship===
Fellows of the RGS come from a wide range of professional backgrounds. They must either be proposed by an existing fellow or an individual may submit evidence of his or her own work and academic publications in the field of geography and closely related subjects such as international development, climate change and expedition medicine. Applicants must be of at least 21 years of age and provide evidence of a body of relevant work; alternatively, a previous five-year commitment at the regular member level (less, at the council&#x27;s discretion) is also considered for eligibility. Fellows may use the post-nominal designation &quot;FRGS&quot; after their names.

==Chartered geographer==

Since 2002 the society has been granted the power to award the status of chartered geographer. The status can be obtained only by those who have a degree in geography or related subject and at least 6 years&#x27; geographical experience, or 15 years&#x27; geographical work experience for those without a degree. Being awarded the status allows the use of the post-nominal letters &quot;CGeog&quot;.

Chartered geographer (teacher) is a professional accreditation available to teachers who can demonstrate competence, experience and professionalism in the use of geographical knowledge or skills in and out of the classroom, and who are committed to maintaining their professional standards through ongoing continuing professional development (CPD).

==Research groups==
The society&#x27;s research and study groups bring together active researchers and professional geographers in particular areas of geography. There are 27 active research groups, with each group organising their own seminars, conferences, workshops and other activities.

==Medals and awards==
The society also presents awards to geographers that have contributed to the advancement of geography.

The most prestigious of these awards are the Founder&#x27;s Medal and the Patron&#x27;s Medal. The award is given for &quot;the encouragement and promotion of geographical science and discovery&quot;, and are approved by King Charles III. The awards originated as an annual gift of fifty guineas from King William IV, first made in 1831, &quot;to constitute a premium for the encouragement and promotion of geographical science and discovery&quot;. The society decided in 1839 to change this monetary award into two gold medals: Founder&#x27;s Medal and the Patron&#x27;s. The award has been given to notable geographers including David Livingstone (1855), Nain Singh Rawat (1876), Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen (1878), Alfred Russel Wallace (1892), and Frederick Courtney Selous (1893) to more recent winners including Percy Harrison Fawcett (1916), Professor William Morris Davis (1919), Sir Halford John Mackinder (1945), Professor L. Dudley Stamp (1949), Professor Richard Chorley (1987) and Professor David Harvey (1995). In 2004 Harish Kapadia was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal for contributions to geographical discovery and mountaineering in the Himalayas, making him the second Indian to receive the award in its history. In 2005 the Founder&#x27;s Medal was awarded to Professor Sir Nicholas Shackleton for his research in the field of Quaternary Palaeoclimatology and the Patron&#x27;s Medal was awarded to Professor Jean Malaurie for a lifelong study of the Arctic and its people. In 1902 they awarded khan Bahadur Sher Jang a Sword of Honour (the Black Memorial) in recognition of his valuable services to geography.

In total the society awards 17 medals and awards including honorary membership and fellowship. Some of the other awards given by the RGS include:
* The Victoria Medal (1902) for &quot;&quot;conspicuous merit in research in Geography&quot;
* The Murchison Award (1882) for the &quot;publication judged to contribute most to geographical science in preceding recent years&quot;
* The Back Award (1882) for &quot;applied or scientific geographical studies which make an outstanding contribution to the development of national or international public policy&quot;
* The Busk Medal (1975) for &quot;conservation research or for fieldwork abroad in Geography or in a geographical aspect of an allied science&quot; 
* The Cuthbert Peek Award (1883) for &quot;those advancing geographical knowledge of human impact on the environment through the application of contemporary methods, including those of earth observation and mapping&quot;
* The Edward Heath Award (1984) for &quot;geographical research in either Europe or the developing world&quot;&quot;
* The Cherry Kearton Medal and Award for &quot;a traveller concerned with the study or practice of natural history, with a preference for those with an interest in nature photography, art or cinematography&quot;.
* The Ness Award for &quot;travellers, particularly those who have successfully popularised Geography and the wider understanding of our world and its environments&quot;

==Collections==

The society&#x27;s collections consist of over two million documents, maps, photographs, paintings, periodicals, artefacts and books, and span 500 years of geography, travel and exploration. The society preserves the collections for the benefit of future generations, while providing public access and promoting collections-related educational programmes for schools and lifelong learners. The Foyle Reading Room acts as a consultation space for using the society&#x27;s collections, and hosts showcases and workshops as well as the &quot;Be Inspired&quot; series of talks.

===Artefacts===
The artefacts collection includes over a thousand items brought to the Society, consisting mainly of cultural objects from around the world, ranging from Inuit boots (from Canadian Arctic) to ceremonial leopard&#x27;s claws (from the then Belgian Congo), paraphernalia of exploration, for example oxygen sets used in the various attempts on Everest, and personal items belonging to explorers, such as Shackleton&#x27;s Burberry helmet. Artefacts from the collection have been loaned to exhibitions around the world and are in continual demand.

===Books and journals===
The library collection holds more than 150,000 bound volumes that focus on the history and geography of places worldwide. Example volumes include information on European migration, a 19th-century guidebook to Berlin, and David Livingstone&#x27;s account of his search for the source of the Nile. It currently receives around 800 journal titles, as well as many more journal titles that are either not currently subscribed to, or have ceased publication, allowing society members access to the latest geographical academic literature in addition to the journals published by the RGS-IBG itself.

===Expedition report===
The RGS-IBG houses a collection of 4,500 expedition reports. These documents contain details of the achievements and research results of expeditions to almost every country of the world. The catalogue of these reports, and over 8,500 planned and past expeditions, is held on a database which provides contact with a wide variety of sporting, scientific and youth expeditions from 1965 to the present day.

===Maps and atlases===
The society holds one of the largest private map collections in the world which is continuously increasing. It includes one million sheets of maps and charts, 3000 atlases, 40 globes and 1000 gazetteers. The earliest printed item in the Collection dates back to 1482. The RGS-IBG also holds manuscript materials from the mid sixteenth century onwards, aerial photography from 1919 and contemporary satellite images.

===Manuscript archive===
The manuscript archive collection consists of material arising out of the conduct of society business and manuscripts relating to persons or subjects of special interest. The document collection includes a few papers from before the society&#x27;s founding in 1830, and is particularly useful to biographers of nineteenth and early twentieth century travellers and geographers, as well as research into the development of geographical knowledge and the historical development of geography.

===Events recordings===
Since 1994, the society has recorded the majority of its Monday night lectures. Society members and fellows can watch selected lectures from 2006 onward online.

===Photographs and artworks===
The society&#x27;s picture library holds over half a million photographs, artworks, negatives, lantern slides and albums dating from around 1830. Historic images range from the Antarctic adventures of Scott and Shackleton to the pioneering journeys of Livingstone, Baker, Speke and Burton.

==Grants==
The RGS-IBG provides funding for geographical research and scientific expeditions. The society offers a number of grants to researchers, students, teachers and independent travellers. More than 70 projects are supported each year and in excess of £180,000 is awarded annually. Research has been conducted in more than 120 countries, from Namibia to Brazil to Greenland.

===Expeditions, fieldwork and independent travel grants===
Every year the RGS-IBG helps teams of students and researchers to get into the field with Geographical Fieldwork Grants, the society&#x27;s longest running grant scheme. The newest initiative is the RGS-IBG International Field Centre Grants, for work in international field centres in developing nations. Independent travel grants support geographical expeditions.

===Student grants===
Each year, the society supports more than 50 student fieldwork projects, from PhD students collecting data for their dissertation to groups of undergraduates looking to get out into the field for the first time. Grants are available for both human and physical geography projects, in any area of the world.

===Research grants===
The society supports a range of field and desk-based research by academic geographers, from established researchers undertaking fieldwork to early career academics working on smaller projects. The RGS-IBG also supports academics attending geographical conferences around the world. Some awards focus on particular geographical regions or topics, with others open to any aspect of the discipline.

===Teaching grants===
The society supports innovation in teaching geography at secondary and higher education level, offering several awards for school teachers to work alongside researchers in geographical research, so to develop educational resources for the classroom, and to create teaching materials.

==Public engagement==

===21st Century Challenges===
21st Century Challenges is the society&#x27;s discussion series that aims to improve public understanding of, and engagement with, some of the big issues likely to affect our lives and society in the coming years. The talks are held at the society&#x27;s headquarters with all talks available to watch online along with additional information.
=== Discovering Britain ===
Discovering Britain is a website featuring a series of self-led geographical walks that help explain the stories behind the UK&#x27;s built and natural landscapes. Each walk explores a particular landscape, finding out about the way in which the forces of nature, people, events and the economy have created and shaped the area. There are now more than 120 walks on the Discovering Britain website, covering all regions of the United Kingdom. Walks are themed according to the landscape in which they are located, including built, prehistoric, historic, working, hidden and changing landscapes. Walks also look at people in the landscape, and shaping, preserving and exploiting the landscape.

===Hidden Journeys===
Hidden Journeys is a public engagement project of the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) that started in 2010. The Hidden Journeys website combines images, stories and maps (many from the Society&#x27;s geographical collections) into a series of interactive guides of popular flight paths, enabling people to explore the incredible places they fly over and might see from the air. Since launching, online guides have been published for more than 25 flight paths, including London to Johannesburg, New York City to Los Angeles, Sydney to Singapore, Madrid to Rio de Janeiro.

The Hidden Journeys project is also integrating its content with the moving maps aboard airliners, as a new form of in-flight entertainment (IFE) that has been termed geo-entertainment or geotainment.

In December 2013, Singapore Airlines began a trial of an enhanced moving map that featured Hidden Journeys content. Developed in partnership between Hidden Journeys and the IFE software company Airborne Interactive, the enhanced map is available for the Singapore-London route on the airline&#x27;s brand new Boeing 777-300ER (flight number SQ308 and SQ319), and features a range of geographical facts and highlights, photography and maps, all curated by the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG). Information is delivered in real time, with content changing as the flight progresses, so for example, while a passenger is passing over the United Kingdom, they&#x27;ll be met with a pop-up that explains the origins and importance of the English Channel.

==Schools==
The RGS-IBG education department offers courses, resources, accreditation, grants, awards, competitions and school membership, all for the benefit of teachers, students and parents. It also runs the Geography Ambassador scheme.

===Educational resources===
The society produces cases studies, lesson plans and activity ideas for an all levels of learning, from KS1 up to post-GCSE. The Geography in the News website is available for student members and young geographers. It has more than 300 topical case studies. Many of the society&#x27;s other resources are free to use.

===Geography Ambassadors===
The Geography Ambassadors scheme recruits, trains and supports volunteer undergraduate, postgraduate and graduate geographers from universities and business. Geography Ambassadors deliver lively, activity-based sessions at schools and they engage with more than 30,000 pupils each year. The scheme is aimed at introducing students to the benefits of studying geography beyond a compulsory level in schools, but also into higher education and employment.

=== Competitions ===
The society also has competitions for students studying geography. The Young Geographer of the Year has four categories for students in KS2 through to A-Level. All students have to produce posters on a given topic, except the A-Level students who are expected to write an essay. For A-Level students there is also the David W. Smith Memorial Award, an annual essay competition, and the Ron Cooke Award for the best A-Level coursework.

==Publications==

===Journals===
The Royal Geographical Society (with IBG)&#x27;s scholarly publications provide an outlet and support for the dissemination of research across the breadth of the discipline. The Society states that its research publications are accessed over a million times per year.

<text>Saare County ( or &quot;Saaremaa&quot;; ; ; ; ) is one of 15 counties of Estonia. It consists of Saaremaa, the largest island of Estonia, and several smaller islands near it, most notably Muhu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi. The county borders Lääne County to the east, Hiiu County to the north, and Latvia to the south. In 2022, Saare County had a population of 31,292, which was 2.4% of the population of Estonia.

== Municipalities ==
The county is subdivided into municipalities. There are 3 rural municipalities ( – parishes) in Saare County.

== Geography ==
The largest islands of the county are Saaremaa, Muhu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi. Arable land is and it has a mild maritime climate. The mean annual air temperature is and the mean annual precipitation is .

== Religion ==

The largest number of congregations in the county are of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (EELC) and there are 15 congregations in the county, which are administered by the EELC&#x27;s Saarte Deanery.

14 Orthodox congregations in the county are under the administration of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church.

Five congregations of Baptists, and other Christian congregations operate in the county.

Among other religions, there is a congregation of the Estonian Neopagan religion in the county.

== Ancient Saare county (Oesel) ==
According to archeological finds, the territory of Saaremaa has been inhabited for at least five thousand years.

In the first centuries AD, political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (kihelkond) and the county (maakond). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century, the following major counties had developed in Estonia: Saaremaa (Oesel), Läänemaa (Rotalia or Maritima), Harjumaa (Harria), Rävala (Revalia), Virumaa (Vironia), Järvamaa (Jervia), Sakala (Saccala), and Ugandi (Ugaunia).

In old Scandinavian sagas, Saaremaa is called &quot;Eysysla&quot; which means exactly the same as the name of the island in Estonian: &quot;the district (land) of island&quot;. This is the origin of the island&#x27;s name in German and Swedish, &quot;Ösel&quot;, Danish, &quot;Øsel&quot;, and in Latin &quot;Oesel&quot;. The name &quot;Eysysla&quot; appears sometimes together with &quot;Adalsysla&quot;, &#x27;the big land&#x27;, perhaps &#x27;Suuremaa&#x27; or &#x27;Suur Maa&#x27; in Estonian which refers to mainland Estonia. Sagas talk about numerous skirmishes between islanders and Vikings. Saaremaa was the wealthiest county of ancient Estonia and the home of notorious Estonian pirates, sometimes called the Eastern Vikings. The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia describes a fleet of sixteen ships and five hundred Oeselians ravaging the area that is now southern Sweden, then belonging to Denmark. In 1206, the Danish Valdemar II the Victorious built a fortress on the island but they found no volunteers to man it. They burned it down themselves and left. In 1227, Saaremaa was conquered by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, but remained a hotbed of Estonian resistance. The Order founded the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek there. When the Order was defeated by the Lithuanian army in the Battle of Saule in 1236, Oeselians rebelled. The conflict was ended by a treaty that was signed by the Oeselians and the Master of the Order.

The Oeselians along with the Curonians were known in the Old Norse Icelandic Sagas and in Heimskringla as &quot;Víkingr frá Esthland&quot; (in English, Estonian Vikings). Their sailing vessels were called pirate ships by Henry of Livonia in his Latin chronicles from the beginning of the 13th century.

&quot;Eistland&quot; or &quot;Esthland&quot; is the historical Germanic language name that refers to the country at the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea in general and is the origin of the modern national name for Estonia. The mainland of modern Estonia in the 8th century Ynglinga saga was called &quot;Adalsyssla&quot; in contrast to &quot;Eysyssel&quot; or &quot;Ösyssla&quot; that was the name of the island (Swedish): Ösel or (Estonian): Saaremaa, the home of the Oeselians (). In the 11th century, Courland and Estland (Estonia) were both denoted separately by Adam of Bremen.

On the eve of the Northern Crusades, the Oeselians were summarized in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle thus: &quot;The Oselians, neighbors to the Kurs (Curonians), are surrounded by the sea and never fear strong armies as their strength is in their ships. In summers when they can travel across the sea they oppress the surrounding lands by raiding both Christians and pagans.&quot;

===Conquest of Saaremaa===
In 1206, the Danish army led by king Valdemar II and Andreas, the Bishop of Lund landed on Saaremaa and attempted to establish a stronghold, but without success. In 1216 the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the bishop Theodorich joined forces and invaded Saaremaa over the frozen sea. The following spring the Oeselians raided the territories in Latvia that were under German rule in revenge. In 1220, the Swedish army led by king John I of Sweden and the bishop Karl of Linköping conquered Lihula in Rotalia in Western Estonia. Oeselians attacked the Swedish stronghold the same year, conquered it and killed the entire Swedish garrison including the Bishop of Linköping.

In 1222, Valdemar II again tried to conquer Saaremaa, this time establishing a stone fortress housing a strong garrison. But the Danish stronghold was besieged, and surrendered within five days, and the Danish garrison returned to Reval, leaving bishop Albert of Riga&#x27;s brother Theodoric and few others behind as hostages for peace. The castle was leveled to the ground by the Oeselians.

In 1227, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, the town of Riga and the Bishop of Riga organized a combined attack against Saaremaa. After the surrender of two major Oeselian strongholds, Muhu and Valjala, the Oeselians formally accepted Christianity.
In 1236, after the defeat of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the Battle of Saule, military action on Saaremaa broke out again.

The Oeselians again accepted Christianity by signing treaties with the Master of Teutonic Order in Livonia Andreas de Velven and the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek in 1241. The next treaty was signed in 1255 by the Master of the Order, Anno Sangerhausenn, and, on behalf of the Oeselians, by men whose &quot;names&quot; (or declaration) were transcribed by Latin scribes as Ylle, Culle, Enu, Muntelene, Tappete, Yalde, Melete, and Cake The treaty granted several distinctive rights to the Oeselians. The 1255 treaty included clauses concerning the ownership and inheritance of land, the social system and autonomy from certain religious rules.

In 1261, warfare continued as the Oeselians had once more renounced Christianity and killed all the Germans on the island. A peace treaty was signed after the united forces of the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order, the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek, and the forces of Danish Estonia, including mainland Estonians and Latvians, defeated the Oeselians by conquering the Kaarma stronghold. Soon afterwards, the Teutonic Knights established a stone fort at Pöide.

On July 24, 1343, the Oeselians again killed all the Germans on the island, drowned all the clerics and started to besiege the fort at Pöide. After its surrender, the Oeselians levelled the castle and killed all the defenders. In February 1344, Burchard von Dreileben led a campaign over the frozen sea to Saaremaa. The Oeselians&#x27; stronghold was conquered and their king Wesse was hanged. In the early spring of 1345, the next campaign of the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order took place; it ended with a treaty mentioned in the Chronicle of Hermann von Wartberge and the Novgorod First Chronicle. Saaremaa remained the vassal of the master of the Teutonic Order in Livonia, and the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek.

<doc id="395922" wikidata="Q545006" url="?curid=395922" title="Swainson's thrush">
<text>Swainson&#x27;s thrush (Catharus ustulatus), also called olive-backed thrush and russet-backed thrush is a medium-sized thrush. It is a member of genus &quot;Catharus&quot; and is typical of it in terms of its subdued coloration and beautiful, ascending flute-like voice. Swainson&#x27;s thrush was named after William Swainson, an English ornithologist.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Catharus&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;katharos&quot;, &quot;pure or clean&quot; and refers to the plumage of the orange-billed nightingale-thrush &quot;C. aurantiirostris&quot;. The specific &quot;ustulatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;burnt&quot;, from &quot;urere&quot;, &quot;to burn&quot;.

==Habitat==
The breeding habitat of Swainson&#x27;s thrush is coniferous woods with dense undergrowth across Canada, Alaska, and the northern United States; also, deciduous wooded areas on the Pacific coast of North America.

==Range and distribution==
These birds migrate to southern Mexico and as far south as Argentina. The coastal subspecies migrate down the Pacific coast of North America and winter from Mexico to Costa Rica, whereas the continental birds migrate eastwards within North America (a substantial detour) and then travel southwards via Florida to winter from Panama to Bolivia. Swainson&#x27;s thrush is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. It has also occurred as a vagrant in northeast Asia.

==Threats==

This species may be displaced by the hermit thrush where their ranges overlap. Possibly, the latter species adapts more readily to human encroachment upon its habitat. At least in the winter quarters, Swainson&#x27;s thrush tends to keep away from areas of human construction and other activity.

==Description==
This species is in length. The wingspan averages at and the wing chord is . The bill measures in length and the tarsus is long. This species&#x27; body mass can range from . This thrush has the white-dark-white underwing pattern characteristic of &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes. Adults are brown on the upperparts. The underparts are white with brown on the flanks; the breast is lighter brown with darker spots. They have pink legs and a light brown eye ring. Birds in the east are more olive-brown on the upperparts; western birds are more reddish brown. This bird&#x27;s song is a hurried series of flute-like tones spiralling upwards.

==Diet==
They forage on the forest floor, also in trees. Swainson&#x27;s thrushes mainly eat insects, fruits and berries. They make a cup nest on a horizontal tree branch.

==Subspecies==

Four subspecies are recognised, &quot;Cathartus ustulatus alame&quot;, &quot;C. u. swainsoni&quot;, &quot;C. u. ustulatus&quot; and &quot;C. u. oedicus&quot;. Subspecies &quot;Cathartus ustulatus alame&quot; and &quot;C. u. swainsoni&quot; summer east of the British Columbian Coast Mountains, the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada, and &quot;C. u. ustulatus&quot; and &quot;C. u. oedicus&quot; summer west of these ranges. There is a small area of overlap in the Coast Mountains. Recent molecular systematics work confirms that these two pairs of subspecies form two genetically distinct clades, referred to as the continental and coastal clades, which diverged during the Late Pleistocene era, probably about 10,000 years ago as the last ice age came to its end and habitats shifted across North America.

The genetic differences between the subspecies, and the circuitous migratory route of the continental birds, strongly suggest that these species underwent a rapid range expansion following the end of the last ice age, with populations originally summering in the south-east of North America expanding their ranges northwards and westwards as the ice retreated. Details of the molecular genetic analysis support the hypothesis of rapid expansion of both coastal and continental populations. The current migratory routes of the continental birds, especially the western populations, are not optimal in ecological terms, and presumably represent an inherited, historical route pattern that has not yet adapted to the birds&#x27; modern population locations.

These results notwithstanding, analysis of mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 as well as nuclear β-fibrinogen intron 7 sequence data shows that Swainson&#x27;s thrush is the most ancient North American species of its genus; it is not closely related to other &quot;Catharus&quot; and the outward similarities with the other North American species are due to convergent evolution.

<text>Jasper Tsang Yok-sing (; born 17 May 1947) is a Hong Kong politician. He is the founding member of the largest pro-Beijing party the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) from 1992 to 2003 and the 2nd President of the Legislative Council from 2008 to 2016.

Graduated from the University of Hong Kong, Tsang chose to teach in the leftist Pui Kiu Middle School and became its principal before he stepped into politics in the 1980s. In 1992 he founded the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong and first contested in the 1995 Legislative Council election in which he lost the race. He was elected in Kowloon West in the first Legislative Council election after the handover of Hong Kong in 1998. He was also the member of the Executive Council from 2002 to 2008.

He became the President of the Legislative Council in 2008. Due to his relatively fair and accommodating presiding styles and his relatively liberal image within the pro-Beijing camp, he enjoyed high popularity within his last years before his retirement from the Legislative Council in 2016. He also expressed interest in running in the 2012 and 2017 Chief Executive elections but did not stand eventually.

==Early life and education==
Tsang was born in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China on 17 May 1947. Tsang&#x27;s father, Tsang Chiu-kan was a clerk at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, a pro-Beijing business organisation in the colony. He moved to Hong Kong when he was two years old and grew up in Sai Wan&#x27;s Academic Terrace. Tsang received his primary and secondary education at St. Paul&#x27;s College run by the Hong Kong Anglican Church. He studied mathematics at the University of Hong Kong, graduating with first class honours.

Tsang grew his patriotic sentiments and interest in Marxism by reading the leftist newspaper &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; which his father brought home from work everyday and worshipped Qian Xuesen, a renowned scientist who returned to the mainland from the United States in the 1950s. In 1966, he went back to Guangzhou with his mother and was impressed by the socialist life there. He proclaimed himself a Marxist and studied works of Karl Marx and Mao Zedong with like-minded classmates at a time when the majority of the students at the University of Hong Kong supported the colonial rule and had negative views on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

==1967 riots and teaching life==
He joined several university students in making donations to the leftist unions through &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; following the industrial dispute at the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Works in April 1967 which later escalated to large-scale riots. He joined the demonstrations in Central and founded a student journal called &quot;New HKU&quot; to launch a counter-propaganda against &quot;The Undergrad&quot;, the official publication of the Hong Kong University Students&#x27; Union which was critical of the riots. His brother, Tsang Tak-sing, was arrested, tried and convicted for distributing anti-government leaflets at school, and was imprisoned for 18 months. In the wake of his brother&#x27;s event, Tsang gave up the plans to further his studies abroad although he had been accepted by four prominent universities in the United States.

After graduating from the University of Hong Kong, Tsang gave up his supposedly bright future as a university graduate and joined the leftist Piu Kiu Middle School as a teacher under the patronage of principal Ng Hong-mun, at the time the pro-CCP leftists were marginalised by the colonial government. After the downfall of Gang of Four in 1976, Tsang began to question his own socialist beliefs. He obtained a Graduate Diploma of Education in 1981 and a Master of Education at the University of Hong Kong in 1983. He went on to become the principal of the Piu Kiu Middle School in 1986 until he left his position to become a full-time politician. He became the supervisor of the school and was also the supervisor of a newly established direct-subsidised school, the Pui Kiu College.

==Political career==
===Stepping into politics===
Despite the events of Gang of Four and the political instability, Tsang remained faithful to the Chinese Communist Party. Due to his good education background, Tsang became a high-flyer within the leftist camp. He stepped into the politics in 1976 when he was appointed a member of the Guangdong provincial committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He later became a member of the CPPCC National Committee in 1993.

In the mid-1980s, Tsang was actively involved in the discussion of the drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the mini-constitution after the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. He was one of the members of the &quot;Group of 38&quot; proposal consisting of educators with leftist background led by Basic Law Consultative Committee member Cheng Kai-nam which put forward a middle-of-the-ground proposal between the uncompromising rift of the pro-business conservative &quot;Group of 89&quot; and the pro-democracy liberal &quot;Group of 190&quot; proposals.

During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, Tsang called for the support of the teachers and students of the Pui Kiu Middle School to support the Tiananmen students and their cause for a democratic China. After the massacre on 4 June, he told the reporters that he was &quot;shocked and sad&quot;. However he and other leftists soon reiterated their position on the event and were recalled under Beijing&#x27;s command.

===DAB Chairman===
After the defeat of the traditional leftist candidates in the first direct election of the Legislative Council by the pro-democracy candidates of the United Democrats of Hong Kong in the wake of the pro-democracy sentiment after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, Tsang and other leftists founded the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong in 1991 under the call of director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Lu Ping to gear up the &quot;patriotic force&quot; in the territory. Tsang became the first chairman of the party. He was subsequently appointed to the Preparatory Committee for the establishment of Hong Kong.

In the 1995 Legislative Council election, he ran in Kowloon Central but was defeated by the less known candidate Liu Sing-lee from the pro-democracy Association for Democracy and People&#x27;s Livelihood (ADPL). He received around 16,000 votes, 43 per cent of the total vote share. He was subsequently elected to the Provisional Legislative Council in 1996 by the Beijing-controlled Selection Committee.

Tsang was first directly elected to the Legislative Council in the first post-handover election in 1998, representing the Kowloon West constituency. In 2002 he was appointed to the Executive Council by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. In 2002 the fifth anniversary of the Special Administrative Region, he was awarded the Gold Bauhinia Star (GBS) by the government.

As the ally of the Tung administration, the DAB suffered criticisms with the unpopular government. During the controversy surrounding the enactment of the national security bill in Hong Kong, Tsang drew criticism for his party&#x27;s support of the government&#x27;s legislative initiatives. Following the 1 July 2003 protests and disappointing performance of his party in the 2003 District Council election, he resigned from the party&#x27;s chairmanship in December 2003.

===Legislative Council President===
He gave up his Kowloon West seat and ran in the Hong Kong Island in the 2008 Legislative Council election. After the election, he was elected to the presidency of the Legislative Council, replacing the retired Rita Fan. He is widely assumed to be a member of the Chinese Communist Party, in part because, when asked directly, he has stated only that, &quot;Since the foundation of the DAB, I have been asked whether I am a Communist Party member many times. And I can say frankly, I have never answered this question. The reason is, Hong Kong people&#x27;s attitude to the concept of the Communist Party is very negative.&quot; He resigned from the Executive Council after being elected the President.

Tsang was also criticised for the manner in which he presided over Legislative Council meetings, which led to walkout protests, though he was generally perceived to be fair and accommodating and enjoyed friendly relations with both pro-Beijing and pan-democratic members. He softened his early years&#x27; staunch pro-Beijing image during his presidency in the Legislative Council and became increasingly sympathetic with the pro-democracy cause. On the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, which he referred to as &quot;suppressing students was surely wrong.&quot; In the run-up to the 2012 Chief Executive election, he was noted for his relatively liberal views on issues such as universal suffrage, and initially expressed interest in putting himself forward as a candidate, before later backing out.

After the legislative vote of the 2015 Hong Kong electoral reform in which the pro-Beijing legislators undertook a controversial and embarrassing walkout, the &quot;Oriental Daily&quot; published leaked messages in which Tsang was seen to have discussed voting strategy with a pro-Beijing legislator in a WhatsApp group before the electoral reform package and suggesting the legislators delay their speeches so that the pan-democrats could not control the timing of the vote. The pan-democrats questioned Tsang&#x27;s neutrality in the chamber, seeing the text messages as &quot;clear evidence&quot; that he was colluding with the rest of the government&#x27;s allies and planned to mull a no-confidence vote against him. He apologised to the legislators but refused to resign.

In annual polls conducted by the University of Hong Kong Public Opinion Programme, Tsang was voted &quot;Hong Kong’s most popular Legislative Councillor&quot; for each of the last 13 years he was in office, 2004-2016 inclusive. In 2016, his support rating was 63.1 percent, ahead of, in order, Regina Ip with 49.6 percent, Alan Leong with 48.2 percent and Starry Lee with a 45.6 percent. On 1 July 2015, Tsang was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the SAR&#x27;s highest honour, in recognition of his public service, particularly his presidency of the Legislative Council.

==After Legislative Council==

In July 2016, after announcing the end of his Legislative Council career, Tsang announced that he was ready to stand in the 2017 Chief Executive election, just as he had publicly toyed with the idea in the 2012 process. He said he would stand against incumbent Leung Chun-ying, expected to seek a second term, in order &quot;to offer a genuine choice&quot;. However, two or three months later he was told privately by the Beijing government not to join the process, he later revealed, and so he publicly distanced himself from any run at the Chief Executive role, describing it as “not a good position to be in” and adding that it required one to serve “two bosses” – Hong Kong society and Beijing.

==Family and personal life==
In 2009, Tsang married Ng Kar-man, a dance instructor, in a ceremony officiated by former Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung. He was previously married to Young Sun-yee.

Tsang&#x27;s younger brother, Tsang Tak-sing, is a pro-establishment politician who served as the Secretary for Home Affairs from 2017 to 2015. 

In February 2017, Tsang was revealed to have had a critical heart condition and underwent angioplasty surgery. Speaking shortly afterwards, he said, &quot;I have narrowly escaped death.&quot;

<text>Lassie is a fictional female Rough Collie dog and is featured in a 1938 short story by Eric Knight that was later expanded to a 1940 full-length novel, &quot;Lassie Come-Home&quot;. Knight&#x27;s portrayal of Lassie bears some features in common with another fictional female collie of the same name, featured in the British writer Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s 1859 short story &quot;The Half Brothers&quot;. In &quot;The Half Brothers&quot;, Lassie is loved only by her young master and guides the adults back to where two boys are lost in a snowstorm. 

Knight&#x27;s novel was filmed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1943 as &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;, with a dog named Pal playing Lassie. Pal then appeared with the stage name &quot;Lassie&quot; in six other MGM feature films through 1951. Pal&#x27;s owner and trainer, Rudd Weatherwax, then acquired the Lassie name and trademark from MGM and appeared with Pal (as &quot;Lassie&quot;) at rodeos, fairs, and similar events across America in the early 1950s. In 1954, the television series &quot;Lassie&quot; debuted and, over the next 19 years, a succession of Pal&#x27;s descendants appeared on the series. The &quot;Lassie&quot; character has appeared in radio, television, film, toys, comic books, animated series, juvenile novels, and other media. Pal&#x27;s descendants continue to play Lassie today.

==History==
===Elizabeth Gaskell short story===
An early depiction of Lassie is found in British writer Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s 1859 short story &quot;The Half-brothers&quot;. In the story, Lassie is described as a female collie with &quot;intelligent, apprehensive eyes&quot; who rescues two half-brothers who are lost and dying in the snow. When the younger brother can no longer carry on, elder brother Gregory, Lassie&#x27;s master, ties a handkerchief around Lassie&#x27;s neck and sends her home. Lassie arrives home, and leads the search party to the boys. When they arrive Gregory is dead, but his younger half-brother is saved. Thus, Gaskell apparently originated the character Lassie and, at the same time, defined the &quot;Lassie saves the day&quot; storyline that is the essence of subsequent Lassie tales.

===World War I incident===
According to writer Nigel Clarke in the &quot;Shipwreck Guide to Dorset and South Devon&quot;, the original Lassie that inspired so many films and television episodes was a rough-haired crossbreed who saved the life of a sailor during World War I.

Half collie, Lassie was owned by the landlord of the Pilot Boat, a pub in the port of Lyme Regis. On New Year&#x27;s Day in 1915 the Royal Navy battleship was torpedoed by a German submarine off Start Point in South Devon, with the loss of more than 500 men. In a storm that followed the accident, a life raft containing bodies was blown along the coast to Lyme Regis. In helping to deal with the crisis, the local pub in Lyme Regis, called the Pilot Boat, offered its cellar as a mortuary.

When the bodies had been laid out on the stone floor, Lassie, a crossbred collie owned by the pub owner, found her way down amongst the bodies, and she began to lick the face of one of the victims, Able Seaman John Cowan. She stayed beside him for more than half an hour, nuzzling him and keeping him warm with her fur. To everyone&#x27;s astonishment, Cowan eventually stirred. He was taken to hospital and went on to make a full recovery. He visited Lassie again when he returned to thank all who saved his life.

When the officers heard the story of Lassie and what she did to rescue Cowan, they told it again and again to any reporter who would listen as it was inspirational and heart-warming. Hollywood got hold of the story, and so a star was born.

===Eric Knight short story and novel===
The fictional character of Lassie was created by English author Eric Knight in &quot;Lassie Come-Home&quot;, first published as a short story in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1938 and later as a full-length novel in 1940. Set in the Depression-era England, the novel depicts the lengthy journey a rough collie makes to be reunited with her young Yorkshire master after her family is forced to sell her for money.

===Movies and television===
In 1943, the novel was adapted into a feature film, &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) that starred Roddy McDowall and Elizabeth Taylor. The movie was a hit and enjoyed favorable critical response. MGM followed this with several additional films, including a sequel entitled &quot;Son of Lassie&quot; (1945), starring Peter Lawford and June Lockhart, and &quot;Courage of Lassie&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor. A radio series, &quot;Lassie Radio Show&quot;, was also created, airing until 1949.
Between 1954–1973, the television series &quot;Lassie&quot; was broadcast, with Lassie initially residing on a farm with a young male master. In the eleventh season, it changed to U.S. Forest Service rangers as her companions, then the collie was on her own for a season before ending the series with Lassie residing at a ranch for orphaned children. The series was the recipient of two Emmy Awards before it was canceled in 1973. Lassie won several PATSY Awards (an award for animal actors). A second series followed in the 1980s. In 1997, Canadian production company Cinar Inc. produced a new &quot;Lassie&quot; television series for the Animal Planet network in the U.S. and YTV in Canada. It ran until 1999.

In 2005, a remake of the original &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; movie was produced in the United Kingdom. Starring Peter O&#x27;Toole and Samantha Morton, &quot;Lassie&quot; was released in 2006.

Additionally, two animated TV series featuring the canine were produced. The first was &quot;Lassie&#x27;s Rescue Rangers&quot;, created by Filmation Associates, which aired on ABC from 1973 to 1975. Nearly four decades later, a new animated series titled &quot;The New Adventures of Lassie&quot; was co-produced by Superprod and Classic Media, in which Lassie was owned by the Parker family and lived in a national park. The series was primarily a traditionally animated (2D hand-drawn animated) TV series, though it also used some CGI animation. It was first seen in the United States starting in 2020 via the CBS All Access streaming service, then carried over to successor service Paramount+.

Lassie continues to make personal and TV show appearances as well as marketing a line of pet food and a current pet care TV show, &quot;Lassie&#x27;s Pet Vet&quot; on PBS stations in the United States. Lassie is one of only four animals (and one of very few fictional characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Kermit the Frog, and Bugs Bunny) to be awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame—the others being silent-film stars Rin Tin Tin, Uggie and Strongheart. In 2005, the show business journal &quot;Variety&quot; named Lassie one of the &quot;100 Icons of the Century&quot;—the only animal star on the list.

Lassie is featured in &quot;Our Nation&#x27;s 200th Birthday, The Telephone&#x27;s 100th Birthday&quot; (1976) by Stanley Meltzoff for Bell System.

<text>The First Battle of the Stronghold (January 17, 1873) was the second battle in the Modoc War of 1872–1873. The battle was fought between the United States Army under Lieutenant Colonel Frank Wheaton and a band of the Native American Modoc tribe from Oregon and California, led by Captain Jack (&quot;Kintpuash&quot; in Modoc).

The US Army forces tried to dislodge the Modoc from the natural fortress, now called Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold, in the lava beds along the south shore of Tule Lake in northeastern California. They had illegally left the Klamath Reservation in Oregon, to which they had been relocated from their territory in order to enable European Americans to settle in the area. The Modoc soundly defeated the Army, inflicting numerous casualties and forcing it to retreat. Factors aiding the Modoc included their excellent defensive position, steady patience, and a thick fog that obscured portions of the battlefield.

==Background==
Immediately after the inconclusive November 27, 1872 Battle of Lost River in Oregon, the Modoc escaped to the lava beds in what is now Lava Beds National Monument, California. Their band included women and children. There they joined a Modoc band led by Shacknasty Jim from Hot Creek, who had not been involved in the Lost River action. The Modoc were encamped at a natural fortress of caves and trenches wide and long in the lava beds, which they had improved to make more defensible. The Modoc had captured about 100 head of cattle which they relied on as a food supply.

The Army moved units from across the Department of the Columbia to the south end of Tule Lake, where the units established two encampments, the larger at Van Brimmer&#x27;s Ranch, about 10 miles west of the Stronghold, and a smaller force at Louis Land&#x27;s Ranch, to the east.

==Forces==
===Modoc===
The Modoc bands numbered about 160 people, 53 of whom were warriors. The leaders of the group were Captain Jack, Shaknasty Jim, Scarfaced Charley, Hooker Jim, and John Schonchin.

===United States===
The US Army force in the field consisted of about 400 men. Lieutenant Colonel Frank Wheaton was in command, and had his headquarters at Van Brimmer&#x27;s Ranch. Major John Green commanded the force in the west, and Captain Reuben Bernard was in command of the forces in the east.

The west force, under Major Green, consisted of the 21st Infantry under Major Edwin Mason; two companies of the Oregon militia under General John E. Ross; 1st Cavalry, Troop F, under Captain David Perry; a company of California volunteers under Captain John O. Fairchild, and one section of two 12-pounder (5 kg) mountain howitzers under 2nd Lieutenant W. H. Miller.

Captain Bernard&#x27;s much smaller force consisted of 1st Cavalry, Troop B under Captain James Jackson and Troop G under 2nd Lieutenant John Kyle; and a company of Klamath scouts under Dave Hill.

==Preparation for attack==
Colonel Wheaton planned a two-pronged attack. The main force in the west would launch the primary attack, with a secondary attack from the east to prevent the Modoc escaping. The two forces were to spread out and meet in the middle of the lava fields, south of the Stronghold, trapping the Modoc against Tule Lake. The howitzers were to provide support for the western attack. All men were to proceed on foot.

The units left their camps on January 16 to move into position. Major Green&#x27;s units arrived at the southwest corner of Tule Lake at 1 pm; the artillery, which had traveled a longer, though flatter route, arrived after dark. Their camp was at the top of a bluff, overlooking the lava beds, about 3 miles west of the Stronghold.

Captain Bernard&#x27;s group also advanced on the 16th, their objective being Hospital Rock, two miles east of the Stronghold. However, a thick fog obscured their view and the forces came within a mile of the Stronghold. At this point Bernard ordered a withdrawal, but the Modoc had already observed them and gave chase. They began firing on Bernard&#x27;s left flank and pack train, before being run off. Three of Bernard&#x27;s men were wounded in the exchange. Bernard&#x27;s force withdrew to Hospital Rock, and prepared for the next day&#x27;s battle.

==Battle==
On the morning of January 17, the battlefield was covered with a thick fog and the weather was damp. In the west Major Green formed a skirmish line, with the 21st Infantry battalion and California volunteers on the left flank, next to the lake, and the Oregon militia on the right flank. He held a detachment of the 21st Infantry and 1st Cavalry, F Troop, in reserve to defend the howitzers. In the east, Bernard&#x27;s force formed up with the Klamath Scouts and B Troop on the left flank, and G troop on the right flank, next to the lake.
The battle orders called for the howitzers to fire three shots as a signal for Bernard to begin the attack, then they were to pause for 15 minutes before resuming firing to give the Modoc a chance to move their women and children out of the Stronghold. However, due to the fog, the howitzer crews could not determine where their shots were landing, and they did not resume firing after the signal shots for fear of hitting their own forces.

Green&#x27;s force advanced on the Stronghold, and after covering , reformed with F Troop taking the extreme right flank, to attempt to join up with Bernard&#x27;s force. At about this time the western force first began taking fire from the Modoc, who had left the Stronghold to attack the Army in the lava beds. Green&#x27;s advance was slowed to almost nothing as the rough terrain and the enemy fire combined to make advance difficult. The Modoc, concealed by the fog and hiding in the rock formations, shot any target presented to them as they slowly gave ground, causing many casualties among the Army. At about 2 pm, Green&#x27;s force came to a &quot;very deep chasm&quot;, which stopped their advance.

In the east, after advancing to about from the Stronghold, Bernard&#x27;s force also came under fire from the Modoc; they charged the enemy as the ground on the east was much easier than on the west. However, after advancing , they encountered a deep gully which they determined to be impassable, and withdrew . Here Bernard&#x27;s force began building crude fortifications out of the available rock.
At this point, Colonel Wheaton abandoned the plan to join the two forces south of the Stronghold. Major Green suggested that they instead attempt to join the units along the lake shore, north of the Stronghold. Orders were shouted to Bernard, who accepted the change in plans. However, Bernard&#x27;s force, behind their makeshift walls, were unwilling to renew the attack. The east force did maintain their position and drew the enemy&#x27;s fire.

With the exception of the Oregon militia, who claimed to be stopped by a ravine, Green&#x27;s force began to move to the north along the shore. The California volunteers, 21st Infantry, and F Troop advanced behind the Stronghold, and were within north of the Stronghold when they were pinned down on the shore by overwhelming Modoc fire. Major Green was wounded when he stood up and urged his men forward, an act for which he later received the Medal of Honor. F Troop and half the 21st Infantry eventually made it to Bernard&#x27;s force, but the rest of the Infantry and the California volunteers were pinned down along the lake shore and were ordered to remain in place until dark. At 5 pm, Colonel Wheaton realized he had failed to capture the Stronghold, and signaled Green and Bernard to retreat. The forces withdrew to their camps, a process that was not completed until after nightfall on January 18. The US soldiers the Modoc had killed were left on the battlefield, which provided the Modoc with additional rifles and ammunition.

The US lost 37 men killed or wounded; the Modoc suffered no casualties. Given the fog and rock cover, no Army survivors reported having seen a Modoc during the battle. The Modoc&#x27;s spiritual leader, Curley Headed Doctor, took credit for raising the fog through his rituals.

==Aftermath==
The defeat of the Army at the First Battle of the Stronghold strengthened the Modoc position. The United States began peace negotiations from a position of weakness. The Modoc also gained confidence in their ability to defend their position against a superior force.

Lt. Col. Wheaton was relieved of command, and replaced by Col. Alvan Gillem, a veteran of the Seminole War. The US Army brought reinforcements to Tule Lake from San Francisco, Nevada, and Oregon. It recruited additional scouts from the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, while the Oregon militia and California volunteers left the field.

During the peace conferences that followed the battle, Major General Edward Canby, commanding officer of the Department of the Columbia, came to the lava beds to lead the peace effort. Mistakenly thinking that killing leaders would encourage the Army to leave the Modoc alone, on Good Friday, April 11, 1873, Captain Jack and some of his men ambushed and killed General Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas, and wounded two more. This act ended the peace talks. The Army initiated the Second Battle of the Stronghold starting April 15.

<text>The French Academy of Sciences (, ) is a learned society, founded in 1666 by Louis XIV at the suggestion of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, to encourage and protect the spirit of French scientific research. It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, and is one of the earliest Academies of Sciences.

Currently headed by Patrick Flandrin (President of the academy), it is one of the five Academies of the .


== History ==

The Academy of Sciences traces its origin to Colbert&#x27;s plan to create a general academy. He chose a small group of scholars who met on 22 December 1666 in the King&#x27;s library, near the present-day Bibliothèque Nationale, and thereafter held twice-weekly working meetings there in the two rooms assigned to the group. The first 30 years of the academy&#x27;s existence were relatively informal, since no statutes had as yet been laid down for the institution.

In contrast to its British counterpart, the academy was founded as an organ of government. In Paris, there were not many membership openings, to fill positions there were contentious elections. The election process was at least a 6-stage process with rules and regulations that allowed for chosen candidates to canvas other members and for current members to consider postponing certain stages of the process if the need would arise. Elections in the early days of the academy were important activities, and as such made up a large part of the proceedings at the academy, with many meetings being held regarding the election to fill a single vacancy within the academy. That is not to say that discussion of candidates and the election process as a whole was relegated to the meetings. Members that belonged to the vacancy&#x27;s respective field would continue discussion of potential candidates for the vacancy in private. Being elected into the academy did not necessarily guarantee being a full member, in some cases, one would enter the academy as an associate or correspondent before being appointed as a full member of the academy.

The election process was originally only to replace members from a specific section. For example, if someone whose study was mathematics was either removed or resigned from his position, the following election process nominated only those whose focus was also mathematics in order to fill that discipline&#x27;s vacancy. That led to some periods of time in which no specialists for specific fields of study could be found, which left positions in those fields vacant since they could not be filled with people in other disciplines.

The needed reform came late in the 20th century, in 1987, when the academy decided against the practice and to begin filling vacancies with people with new disciplines. This reform was not only aimed at further diversifying the disciplines under the academy, but also to help combat the internal aging of the academy itself. The academy was expected to remain apolitical, and to avoid discussion of religious and social issues.

On 20 January 1699, LouisXIV gave the Company its first rules. The academy received the name of Royal Academy of Sciences and was installed in the Louvre in Paris. Following this reform, the academy began publishing a volume each year with information on all the work done by its members and obituaries for members who had died. This reform also codified the method by which members of the academy could receive pensions for their work.

The academy was originally organized by the royal reform hierarchically into the following groups: Pensionaires, Pupils, Honoraires, and Associés.

The reform also added new groups not previously recognized, such as Vétéran. Some of these role&#x27;s member limits were expanded and some roles even removed or combined throughout the course of academy&#x27;s history. The Honoraires group establish by this reform in 1699 whose members were directly appointed by the King was recognized until its abolishment in 1793.

Membership in the academy the exceeded 100 officially-recognised full members only in 1976, 310 years after the academy&#x27;s inception in 1666. The membership increase came with a large-scale reorganization in 1976. Under this reorganization, 130 resident members, 160 correspondents, and 80 foreign associates could be elected.

A vacancy opens only upon the death of members, as they serve for life. During elections, half of the vacancies are reserved for people less than 55 years old. This was created as an attempt to encourage younger members to join the academy.

The reorganization also divided the academy into 2 divisions:

One division, Division 1, covers the applications of mathematics and physical sciences,

the other, Division 2, covers the applications of chemical, natural, biological, and medical sciences.

On 8 August 1793, the National Convention abolished all the academies. On 22 August 1795, a National Institute of Sciences and Arts was put in place, bringing together the old academies of the sciences, literature and arts, among them the and the Académie des sciences.

Also in 1795, The academy determined these 10 titles (first 4 in Division 1 and the others in Division 2) to be their newly accepted branches of scientific study:

# Mathematics
# Mechanics
# Astronomy
# Physics
# Chemistry
# Mineralogy
# Botany
# Agriculture
# Anatomy and Zoology
# Medicine and Surgery

The last two sections are bundled since there were many good candidates fit to be elected for those practices, and the competition was stiff. Some individuals like Francois Magendie had made stellar advancements in their selected fields of study, that warranted a possible addition of new fields. However, even someone like Magendie that had made breakthroughs in Physiology and impressed the academy with his hands-on vivisection experiments, could not get his study into its own category. Despite Magendie being one of the leading innovators of his time, it was still a battle for him to become an official member of the academy, a feat he would later accomplish in 1821. He further improved the reverence of the academy when he and anatomist Charles Bell produced the widely known &quot;Bell-Magendie Law&quot;.

From 1795 until 1914, the first world war, the French Academy of Science was the most prevalent organization of French science. Almost all the old members of the previously abolished Académie were formally re-elected and retook their ancient seats. Among the exceptions was Dominique, comte de Cassini, who refused to take his seat. Membership in the academy was not restricted to scientists: in 1798 Napoleon Bonaparte was elected a member of the academy and three years later a president in connection with his Egyptian expedition, which had a scientific component. In 1816, the again renamed &quot;Royal Academy of Sciences&quot; became autonomous, while forming part of the Institute of France; the head of State became its patron. In the Second Republic, the name returned to Académie des sciences. During this period, the academy was funded by and accountable to the Ministry of Public Instruction.
The academy came to control French patent laws in the course of the eighteenth century, acting as the liaison of artisans&#x27; knowledge to the public domain. As a result, academicians dominated technological activities in France.
The academy proceedings were published under the name &quot;Comptes rendus de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot; (1835–1965). The &quot;Comptes rendus&quot; is now a journal series with seven titles. The publications can be found on site of the French National Library.

In 1818 the French Academy of Sciences launched a competition to explain the properties of light. The civil engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel entered the competition by submitting a new wave theory of light. Siméon Denis Poisson, one of the members of the judging committee, studied Fresnel&#x27;s theory in detail. Being a supporter of the particle-theory of light, he looked for a way to disprove it. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he demonstrate that Fresnel&#x27;s theory predicts that an on-axis bright spot would exist in the shadow of a circular obstacle, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle-theory of light. The Poisson spot is not easily observed in every-day situations and so it was only natural for Poisson to interpret it as an absurd result and that it should disprove Fresnel&#x27;s theory. However, the head of the committee, Dominique-François-Jean Arago, and who incidentally later became Prime Minister of France, decided to perform the experiment in more detail. He molded a 2-mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax. To everyone&#x27;s surprise he succeeded in observing the predicted spot, which convinced most scientists of the wave-nature of light.

For three centuries women were not allowed as members of the academy. This meant that many women scientists were excluded, including two-time Nobel Prize winner Marie Curie, Nobel winner Irène Joliot-Curie, mathematician Sophie Germain, and many other deserving women scientists. The first woman admitted as a correspondent member was a student of Curie&#x27;s, Marguerite Perey, in 1962. The first female full member was Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat in 1979.

Membership in the academy is highly geared towards representing common French populace demographics. French population increases and changes in the early 21st century led to the academy expanding reference population sizes by reform in the early 2002.

The overwhelming majority of members leave the academy posthumously, with a few exceptions of removals, transfers, and resignations. The last member to be removed from the academy was in 1944. Removal from the academy was often for not performing to standards, not performing at all, leaving the country, or political reasons. In some rare occasions, a member has been elected twice and subsequently removed twice. This is the case for Marie-Adolphe Carnot.

== Government interference ==
The most direct involvement of the government in the affairs of the institute came in the initial nomination of members in 1795, but as its members nominated constituted only one third of the membership and most of these had previously been elected as members of the respective academies under the old regime, few objections were raised. Moreover, these nominated members were then completely free to nominate the remaining members of the institute. Members expected to remain such for life, but interference occurred in a few cases where the government suddenly terminated membership for political reasons. The other main interference came when the government refused to accept the result of academy elections. The academies control by the government was apparent in 1803, when Bonaparte decided on a general reorganization. His principal concern was not the First class but the Second, which included political scientists who were potential critics of his government. Bonaparte abolished the second class completely and, after a few expulsions, redistributed its remaining members, together with those of the Third class, into a new Second class concerned with literature and a new Third class devoted to the fine arts. Still this relationship between the academy and the government was not a one-way affair, as members expected to receive their payment of an honorarium.

== Decline ==
Although the academy still exists today, after World War I, the reputation and status of the academy was largely questioned. One factor behind its decline was the development from a meritocracy to gerontocracy: a shift from those with demonstrated scientific ability leading the academy to instead favoring those with seniority. It became known as a sort of &quot;hall of fame&quot; that lost control, real and symbolic, of the professional scientific diversity in France at the time. Another factor was that in the span of five years, 1909 to 1914, funding to science faculties considerably dropped, eventually leading to a financial crisis in France.

== Present use ==

Today the academy is one of five academies comprising the . Its members are elected for life. Currently, there are 150 full members, 300 corresponding members, and 120 foreign associates. They are divided into two scientific groups: the Mathematical and Physical sciences and their applications and the Chemical, Biological, Geological and Medical sciences and their applications. The academy currently has five missions that it pursues. These being the encouraging of the scientific life, promoting the teaching of science, transmitting knowledge between scientific communities, fostering international collaborations, and ensuring a dual role of expertise and advise. The French Academy of Science originally focused its development efforts into creating a true co-development Euro-African program beginning in 1997. Since then they have broadened their scope of action to other regions of the world. The standing committee COPED is in charge of the international development projects undertaken by the French Academy of Science and their associates. The current president of COPED is Pierre Auger, the vice president is Michel Delseny, and the honorary president is Francois Gros. All of which are current members of the French Academy of Science. COPED has hosted several workshops or colloquia in Paris, involving representatives from African academies, universities or research centers, addressing a variety of themes and challenges dealing with African development and covering a large field spectrum. Specifically higher education in sciences, and research practices in basic and applied sciences that deal with various aspects relevant to development (renewable energy, infectious diseases, animal pathologies, food resources, access to safe water, agriculture, urban health, etc.).

== Current committees and working parties ==
The Academic Standing Committees and Working Parties prepare the advice notes, policy statements and the Academic Reports.

<text>Jiangmen (), alternately romanized in Cantonese as Kongmoon, is a prefecture-level city in Guangdong Province in southern China. It consists of three urban districts (Pengjiang, Jianghai, Xinhui), Heshan, and the more rural Siyi (Xinhui, Taishan, Kaiping, and Enping), which is the ancestral homeland of approximately 4 million overseas Chinese. As of the 2020 census, Jiangmen had a total population of about 4,798,090. Its urban region, consisting of Pengjiang, Jianghai, and Heshan, had 2,657,062 inhabitants.

==Names==
Jiangmen is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese name or , based on its pronunciation in the Mandarin dialect. Its former Wade-Giles spelling was . The Postal Map spelling &quot;Kongmoon&quot; was based upon the same name&#x27;s Cantonese pronunciation &quot;Gong¹-moon⁴&quot;. Other forms of the name include Kongmoon, Kongmun, and Kiangmoon.

Jiangmen is also known as Pengjiang. Its rural hinterland is known to the Chinese diaspora as the &quot;Four Counties&quot; (q.v.), although the addition of Heshan to Jiangmen has prompted the remaining locals to begin calling it the &quot;Five Counties&quot; instead.

==History==
Jiangmen was forced to open up to western trade in 1904, after a 1902 declaration which made it a treaty port. During the subsequent period of western influence, a number of western-style buildings were constructed along the city&#x27;s waterfront, and currently, the city&#x27;s government is partaking in a renewal project to restore many of these buildings.

On 6 August 1925, the Guangdong provincial government placed Jiangmen under direct administration of the provincial government. Jiangmen was given a city government on 26 November of the same year. In 1931, this status would be revoked, and the city was placed under the administration of Xinhui County.

The city was incorporated into the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 23 October 1949, and was proclaimed a city in 1951. The city later became the prefectural seat for the Sze Yup (&quot;Four County&quot;) region including Taishan, Kaiping, Xinhui, Enping. In Mainland China but not abroad, the area became known as the &quot;Five Counties&quot; when Heshan was added to Jiangmen&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In June 1983, the city was upgraded to a prefecture-level city.

In 2011, the city banned pet dogs in public after rabies killed 42 people over the preceding 3 years. The city reserved a 13-acre site to allow rural Chinese to adopt the 30,000 dogs, but public outcry led to a softer implementation where violators would be told to leave rather than have the dog confiscated.

In 2017, Jiangmen Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone ranked 64th among national hi-tech zones in China.

In 2020, Jiangmen Station of the West Pearl River Delta Transportation Center opened to the public.

==Geography==
The city is located on the lower reaches of the Xi River and the , in the western section of the Pearl River Delta in the middle of southern Guangdong Province. It faces the South China Sea in the south and is away from Guangzhou and Zhuhai by highway. Jiangmen city has an area of , about one quarter the size of the Pearl River Delta.

==Climate==

The climate is subtropical with monsoonal influences. The annual average temperature is .

==Economy==
Jiangmen was selected by the Chinese state as a pilot city for a nationwide information programme. It was also chosen by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) as a trial city for the Regional Integration for Sustainable Economics (RISE) project. According to the World Bank&#x27;s &quot;Report on Investment Environment in China&quot; for 2005, Jiangmen was ranked the sixth most conducive city in China for investment.

The economic development strategies within Jiangmen focus on the three urban districts, and the south, middle and north lines. It is planned to develop four main economic areas: the central urban district of the city, the Yinzhou Lake () economic area, and two economic areas along the various transport axes.

In 2018, the city reported a GDP of 290.041 billion Yuan, government revenue totaling 24.393 billion Yuan, and retail sales totaling 140.758 billion Yuan. In 2024, the city reported a GDP of 4022.96 billion Yuan.

===Manufacturing industries===
Similar to other cities in the western Pearl River Delta, the manufacturing sector plays a significant role in Jiangmen&#x27;s economy. The chief industries include manufacturing of New energy, machinery, textiles, paper, food products, electronics, and building materials. Other major industries include high-speed rail, motorcycles, household appliances, food processing, synthetic fibers and garments, and stainless steel products. Global brand names with a presence in the city include BP, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Hyundai, Panasonic, Veolia, Hutchison Whampoa, ABB and Tesco. Some worldwide brand which have factories in Jiangmen such include Basf, Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings and Lee Kum Kee foods.

====Uranium processing plant====
The city was the proposed site of a $6.5 billion, 40 billion renminbi, uranium processing plant which would have supplied about half of the enriched uranium needed by China&#x27;s nuclear power plants. Announcement of the plant in July 2013 was met by public protests. The proposal was withdrawn out of &quot;respect for public opinion&quot; shortly thereafter.

===Jiangmen port===
Jiangmen Port is the second largest river port in Guangdong province. The local government plans to develop a harbour industrial zone with heavy industries to include petrochemical and machinery plants, as well as an ocean-based economy.

==Administration==
==Culture==

Jiangmen is the ancestral homeland of approximately 4 million overseas Chinese, who live in 107 countries and regions throughout the world. Strong oversea connections are especially found in the villages. The dialect spoken in Jiangmen city itself is a Siyi Yue dialect, but is distinct from the Taishanese spoken in Taishan City. Every year, A unique dragon dance is performed in water during Pan Village Lantern Festival in Shuikou Town, Kaiping, Jiangmen, Guangdong.

==Tourism==

A significant amount of historical heritage survives from the period of mass emigration prior to World War II. The most significant are the fortified multi-story towers found mainly in Kaiping. These are known as &quot;Gold Mountain Towers&quot; or diaolou. A number of natural hotspring resorts has been developed successfully by using its wealthy natural heated ground water resources such as Gudou Hotspring Resort (). Guifeng Mountain, a mountain visited by many tourists, is the peak of Jiangmen with an elevation of 545 meters above sea level.

The local government&#x27;s economic development strategies emphasize the development of tourism and protection of the environment.

==Education==
===Universities and Colleges===
Wuyi University is the only university which is founded within the city, whereby it&#x27;s one of the member of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao University Alliance (GHMUA). And Guangzhou Huali College Jiangmen campus is also located in the city.

And there are also some Vocational colleges in the city: 
* Jiangmen Polytechnic College, located at Chaolian Island, enrolls about 13,000 students in various technical and humanities programs.
* Guangdong Jiangmen Chinese Medicine College
* Guangdong Jiangmen Preschool Normal College
* Guangdong Nanfang Institute of Technology

===Secondary Education===

The only international school in Jiangmen is Boren Sino-Canadian School, while bilingual schools include WuYi Country Garden Bilingual School and China-Hong Kong English School.

Jiangmen No. 1 Middle School is claimed to be the top middle school in the district. It used to be one of the best middle schools in Guangdong Province in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the quality of its education has been dropping in recent years and within the district of Jiangmen, its status is being constantly challenged by schools such as Xinhui No. 1 Middle School in Xinhui, Kaiqiao (Kaiping Emigrant) Middle School in Kiaping and Heshan No.1 Middle School in Heshan.

==Transport==
===Roads and highways===
Jiangmen has a mature network of inter-city and intra-city highways and expressways, whose total length has reached as of 2016. G15 Shenyang–Haikou Expressway travels at the north, connecting downtown Jiangmen to three of its administrative divisions Heshan, Kaiping and Enping, as well as nearby cities Yangjiang, Zhongshan and Foshan. goes along Jiangmen&#x27;s coastlines, linking Zhuhai at the east and Yangjiang at the west.

===Railways===
Although the very first railway, Sun Ning Railway, began operation in 1909, it was discontinued in 1938 to deny its use by the Japanese military. The second operational railway is the Jiangmen branch of Guangzhou–Zhuhai intercity railway (opened 2011), which provides frequent service from Jiangmen railway station / Jiangmen East railway station to Guangzhou South Railway Station, where connections to the nation&#x27;s high-speed railway network are available. Since the late 2012, Jiangmen is also served by the freight-only Guangzhou–Zhuhai Railway. Shenzhen–Zhanjiang high-speed railway, which opened in 2018, connects Jiangmen at Jiangmen railway station and Xinhui railway station, Shuangshuizhen railway station, Taishan, Kaiping South railway station and Enping railway station.

<doc id="395938" wikidata="Q1367569" url="?curid=395938" title="Gray-cheeked thrush">
<text>The gray-cheeked thrush (Catharus minimus) is a medium-sized thrush. This species is in length, and has the white-dark-white underwing pattern characteristic of &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes. It is a member of a close-knit group of migrant species together with the veery and Bicknell&#x27;s thrush; it forms a cryptic species pair with the latter. The gray-cheeked thrush is all but indistinguishable from Bicknell&#x27;s thrush except by its slightly larger size and different song. The two were formerly considered conspecific. Of all the American spotted thrushes, the gray-cheeked has the most northern breeding range.

==Description==

The gray-cheeked thrush is slightly larger than other &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes, about 16 to in height and weighing between 26 and 30g. Wingspan ranges from 12.6-13.4 in (32-34 cm). The bird can be identified by its grayish face, partial pale eyering, drab gray-brown upperside and extensively dusky flanks. The area between the eye and the beak is grayish as well, but the area running from the beak to above the eye is grayish white. The gray-cheeked thrush is nearly identical to the Bicknell&#x27;s Thrush.

There are two subspecies: the northern gray-cheeked thrush (&quot;Catharus minimus alicia&quot;), and the nominate subspecies, the Newfoundland gray-cheeked thrush (&quot;C. m. minimus&quot;). &quot;C. m. minimus&quot; can be distinguished by its overall browner coloration and buffer wash to the breast compared to &quot;C. m. alicia&quot;. &quot;C. m. minimus&quot; also has an extensive brighter yellow area at the base of the lower part of the beak. &quot;C. m. alicia&quot; has a grayish olive upperpart (whereas &quot;C. m. minimus&quot; has a brownish olive upperpart) and flanks, a lightly washed cream breast and duller lower part of the beak.

==Taxonomy==
In addition to being almost identical physically, the gray-cheeked thrush is sister species to the Bicknell&#x27;s thrush (&quot;Catharus bicknelli&quot;). The divergence of the two species is very recent since only little genetic divergence separate them. Dr. Henri Ouellet was the first to propose the separation between the Bicknell&#x27;s and the gray-cheeked thrush in 1996.

==Habitat and distribution==
The gray-cheeked thrush is a long-distance migrant species with a migration on average of 300 km. They are believed to spend their winter in the Amazon basin and will cross the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico during their spring migration.

They are present in their breeding ground from May to August. They breeding range includes the northern boreal forests from Newfoundland to Alaska in North America and across the Bering Sea to Eastern Siberia associated with dense conifer and broadleaf shrub thickets. &quot;C. minimus&quot; remains uncommon to rare in most regions of North America but can be spotted in any wooded habitat. The breeding range extends north of the treeline into low Arctic willow and alder beds. Grey-cheeked thrushes prefer low coniferous woods, including young regenerating forests, open canopy old growth forests having a dense growth of shrubs and small conifers in the understory, and dense, stunted spruce and fir on windblown sites and near the tree line.

The subspecies of &quot;C. minimus&quot; are also separated by their different breeding ranges: &quot;C. m. alicia&quot; breeds from Labrador west to Siberia, and &quot;C. m. minimus&quot; breeds on the island of Newfoundland and possibly adjacent portions of southern coastal Labrador.

== Behavior ==
=== Vocalizations ===
The vocalizations of the gray-cheeked thrush are the most reliable way to identify it, compared to the Bicknell&#x27;s Thrush. It has a complex song of burry flute-like notes, usually inflecting downward at the end. It resembles a descending spiral like the veery (&quot;Catharus fuscescens&quot;), but higher, thinner, and nasal with stuttering pauses: &quot;ch-ch zreeew zi-zi-zreeee zizreeew&quot;. The flight call is a high, penetrating, nasal &quot;queer&quot;. It is more likely to hear its nocturnal flight call during spring and fall migration than to observe the species on the ground. The nocturnal flight note a one or two note &quot;whe-eer&quot; dropping in pitch.

=== Diet ===
&quot;C. minimus&quot; consumes mainly insects, such as beetles, weevils, ants, wasps, and caterpillars, in addition to arachnids as well as fruits and berries (wild cherries, blackberries, and raspberries). It also feeds on crayfish, sow bugs, and earthworms.

Their habits of eating berries contribute to the dispersion of seeds.

=== Reproduction ===
&quot;C. minimus&quot; exhibits secretive behaviour during breeding season, and nesting pairs are rarely found in high densities as their territories are well-spaced. They build their nests on the ground or in low shrubs, typically less than 2 meters high. Females build the nest with dried grasses mixed with a supporting layer of mud. There is only one brood per season, although they will lay a second brood if the first nest fails early in the season.

There is an average of 4 eggs per nest, but it may vary between 3 and 5 eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 13 to 14 days. The eggs are greenish blue, marked with light brown dots and oval to short oval in shape. Nestlings fledge 11 to 13 days after hatching and the young are cared for by both parents. Individuals breed at one year of age and are presumed monogamous.

<text>Jane Srygley Mouton (April 15, 1930 – December 7, 1987) was an American management theorist, remembered in particular for developing the Managerial grid model with Robert R. Blake.

==Biography==
Mouton was born in Port Arthur, Texas in 1930. Her father, Theodore Quarles Srygley, was an educator and her mother, Grace Stumpe Srygley, was a psychologist. She married an investor, Jackson, C. Mouton, Jr. on December 22, 1953. The Moutons had two daughters named Jane Martha and Jacquelyn Cruse.

Jane Srygley Mouton received her Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Education from the University of Texas at Austin in 1950 and later returned to complete a PhD in 1957 (Contemporary, 2004). She also received a Masters of Science from Florida State University in 1951. She was loyal to the University of Texas at Austin with her working positions including being a research scientist from 1953 to 1957, a social science researcher and instructor from 1957 to 1959, and assistant professor of psychology from 1959 to 1964. She was furthermore vice-president of Scientific Methods Inc. from 1961 to 1981 and presided as president of the company after 1982.

Mouton was a former student of Robert Blake from the University of Texas. Together they are known for their creation of the aforementioned Managerial Grid which was admittedly composed of Mouton&#x27;s creation and Blake&#x27;s name (Bokeno, 2007).

The Grid came into existence when Blake and Mouton were hired as consultants by Exxon. It was during this time that their supposedly combined efforts produced the grid as a method of finding a median between McGregor&#x27;s Theory X and Theory Y workers (Capstone, 2003). Originally, their work was reflected upon the National Training Laboratories (NTL) who they had worked with as a means of bringing their ideas into the organizations (Kleiner, 1996).

Mouton was among the few women to lead one of the NTL&#x27;s T-Groups (Training Groups) during the 1950s. However, Blake and Mouton&#x27;s methodology was more focused on treating the organizational issues rather than simply diagnosing them. This was contrary to standard NTL practices. Thus, they separated from the company. Blake had copyrighted the Grid so that only by franchising with him could someone else use the Grid for training, thus ensuring that everyone would use it in the way Blake and Mouton deemed fitting. Therefore, through their work with NTL leading T-Group&#x27;s and the creation of Mouton&#x27;s Managerial Grid, Blake and Mouton became famous, eventually co-founding Scientific Methods, Inc. in 1961 (Ultimate, 2003).

<text>Anne Waldman (born April 2, 1945) is an American poet.
Since the 1960s, Waldman has been an active member of the Outriders Poetry Project experimental poetry community as a writer, performer, collaborator, professor, editor, scholar, and cultural/political activist. She has also been connected to the Beat Generation poets.

==Personal life==
Born in Millville, New Jersey, Waldman was raised on MacDougal Street in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, and received her B.A. degree from Bennington College in 1966.

Waldman has been quoted, describing growing up in Greenwich Village in the early 1960s: &quot;we benefited from the trials of young women who had struggled to be creative and assertive before us, and we were certainly aware of the exciting artistic and liberal heritage of our New York environs and yet many of us fell into the same retrograde traps. Being dominated by relationships with men— letting our own talents lag, following their lead — which could really result in drug dependencies, painful abortions, alienation from family and friends… I knew interesting and creative women who became junkies for their boyfriends, who stole for their boyfriends, who concealed their poetry and artistic aspirations, who slept around to be popular, who had serious eating disorders, who concealed their unwanted pregnancies raising money for abortions on their own, who put the child up for adoption, who never felt like they owned and appreciated their bodies. I knew women who lived secret or double lives because love and sexual attraction to another woman was an anathema. I knew women in daily therapy because their fathers had abused them, or women who got sent away to mental hospitals or special schools because they&#x27;d taken a black lover. Some ran away from home. Some committed suicide.&quot;

Waldman has been a fervent activist for social change. In the 1970s, she was involved with the Rocky Flats Truth Force, an organization opposed to the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility ten miles to the south of Boulder, Colorado. With Daniel Ellsberg and Allen Ginsberg, she was arrested for protesting outside of the site. She has been a vocal proponent for feminist, environmental, and human rights causes; an active participant in Poets Against the War; and she has helped organize protests in New York and Washington, D. C. Waldman says that her life&#x27;s work is to &quot;keep the world safe for poetry&quot;.

Waldman married Reed Bye in 1980, and their son, Edwin Ambrose Bye, was born on October 21, 1980. The birth of her son proved to be an &quot;inspiring turning point&quot; for Waldman, and she became interested in and committed to the survival of the planet. Her child, she said, became her teacher. Waldman and Ambrose Bye perform frequently, and the two have created &quot;Fast Speaking Music&quot; and have produced multiple albums together.

==Career==
During the 1960s, Waldman became part of the East Coast poetry scene, in part through her engagement with the poets and artists loosely termed the Second Generation of the New York School. During this time, Waldman also made many connections with earlier generations of poets, including figures such as Allen Ginsberg, who once called Waldman his &quot;spiritual wife.&quot; From 1966 to 1968, she served as assistant director of the Poetry Project at St. Mark&#x27;s; and, from 1968 to 1978, she served as the Project&#x27;s Director.

In the early 1960s, Waldman became a student of Buddhism. In the 1970s, along with Allen Ginsberg, she began to study with the Tibetan Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche. While attending the Berkeley Poetry Conference in 1965, Waldman, with poet Lewis Warsh, was inspired to found &quot;Angel Hair&quot;, a small press that produced a magazine of the same name and a number of smaller books. It was while she was attending this conference that she first committed to poetry after hearing the Outrider poets.

In 1974, with Trungpa, Ginsberg, and others, Waldman founded the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado (now Naropa University), where she remains a Distinguished Professor of Poetics and the Director of Naropa&#x27;s celebrated Summer Writing Program.

In 1976, Waldman and Ginsberg were featured in Bob Dylan&#x27;s film &quot;Renaldo and Clara&quot;. They worked on the film while traveling through New England and Canada with the Rolling Thunder Revue, a concert tour that made impromptu stops, entertaining enthusiastic crowds with poetry and music. Waldman, Ginsberg, and Dylan were joined on these caravans by musicians including Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Eric Anderson, and Joe Cocker. Waldman reveled in the experience, and she often thought of recreating the poetry caravan.

Although her work is sometimes connected to the Beat Generation, Waldman has never been, strictly speaking, a &quot;Beat&quot; poet. Her work, like that of her contemporaries in the 1970s New York milieu of which she was a vital part—writers such as Alice Notley and Bernadette Mayer, to name only two—is more diverse in its influences and ambitions. Waldman is particularly interested in the performance of her poetry: she considers performance a &quot;ritualized event in time&quot;, and she expresses the energy of her poetry through exuberant breathing, chanting, singing, and movement. Waldman credits her poem &quot;Fast Speaking Woman&quot; as the seminal work that galvanized her idea of poetry as performance. Ginsberg, Kenneth Koch, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti all encouraged her to continue to perform her poetry.

Waldman has published more than forty books of poetry. Her work has been widely anthologized, featuring work in &quot;Breaking the Cool&quot; (University of Mississippi Press, 2004), &quot;All Poets Welcome&quot; (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2003), &quot;Women of the Beat Generation&quot; (Berkeley, CA: Conari Press, 1996), &quot;Postmodern American Poetry&quot; (New York: W.W. Norton, 1994) and &quot;Up Late (Four Walls Eight Windows, New York, 1988)&quot; among other publications. Her poems have been translated into French, Italian, German, Turkish, Spanish, and Chinese. Waldman is also the editor of several volumes relating to modern, postmodern, and contemporary poetry. Over the course of her career, Waldman has also been a tireless collaborator, producing works with artists Elizabeth Murray, Richard Tuttle, Meredith Monk, George Schneeman, Donna Dennis, Pat Steir; musicians Don Cherry, Laurie Anderson, and Steve Lacy; dancer Douglas Dunn; filmmaker and husband Ed Bowes; and her son, musician/composer Ambrose Bye.

Waldman has been a Fellow at the Emily Harvey Foundation (Winter 2008) and the Bellagio Center in Italy (Spring 2006). She has also held residencies at the Christian Woman&#x27;s University of Tokyo (Fall 2004); the Schule für Dichtung in Vienna (where she has also served as Curriculum Director in 1989); the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey (1984). She has served as an advisor to the Prazska Skola Projekt in Prague, the Study Abroad on the Bowery (since 2004), and has been a faculty member in the New England College Low Residency MFA Program (since 2003). She is the recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Contemporary Artists Foundation, and the Poetry Foundation. With writer and scholar Ammiel Alcalay, she founded the Poetry Is News Coalition in 2002. Waldman also won the International Poetry Championship Bout in Taos, New Mexico, twice. In 2011, Waldman was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.

Her archive of historical, literary, art, tape, and extensive correspondence materials (including many prominent literary correspondents, such as: William S. Burroughs, Robert Creeley, Diane Di Prima, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, and Ken Kesey) resides at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Special Collections Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan. A 55-minute film titled &quot;Anne Waldman: Makeup on Empty Space&quot;, a film by poet Jim Cohn, documents the opening of the Anne Waldman Collection at the University of Michigan.

In an interview with &quot;The Wire&quot; from the Jaipur Literature Festival in 2017, Waldman was asked about the way her poetry crosses forms and incorporates songs and chants, and how she develops this type of poem. She said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been interested in a bigger form, one that doesn&#x27;t just rest quietly on the page. The performative quality is there because there needs to be an extra emphasis. Rather than reading quietly, I feel the physical need to do something bigger. I don&#x27;t walk around as an angry person all the time, but there are different states of minds. Like in Hinduism, the gods and goddesses embody different states of being and experience. That&#x27;s the idea. Then, some things are written for protest. They have the need to arise.&quot;

Waldman is set to curate “Beat Art Work: Power of the Gaze&quot; as part of the 2024 Outsider Art Fair. The exhibit includes visual art by poets such as William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Diane di Prima, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and Joanne Kyger.

==Municipalities==
The county is subdivided into municipalities. There is one urban municipality, Haapsalu ( – town) and 2 rural municipalities ( – parishes) in Lääne County.

== Religion ==

== History ==
In the first centuries AD political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish () and the county (). A parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. A county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major districts had developed in Estonia: Saaremaa (Osilia), Läänemaa (Rotalia or Maritima), Harjumaa (Harria), Rävala (Revalia), Virumaa (Vironia), Järvamaa (Jervia), Sakala (Saccala), and Ugandi (Ugaunia).

Läänemaa (, Low German: &quot;Wiek&quot;) was an independent country on the east coast of the Baltic Sea, bordered by Revala, Harjumaa, Alempois, and Sakala. Läänemaa had an area of approximately 1900 hides. Early in 1220 troops from Sweden, initially led by King John I, had invaded Läänemaa. The Swedish army took the Lihula stronghold and set up a small garrison. Swedish Jarl Karl Döve and Bishop Karl Magnusson of Linköping, both from the powerful House of Bjälbo, also remained in the castle. On August 8, 1220, the united Œselian and Rotalian armies encircled the castle at dawn. It was set ablaze in the course of the fierce battle that ensued. The Swedish troops tried to make their way out, but were killed on site apart from a few who succeeded in escaping to Tallinn, held by Denmark. The Jarl, the Bishop, and almost 500 other Swedes were killed, leaving no Swedish presence in Estonia at all. The short-lived Swedish attempt to gain foothold in Estonia was motivated by the quickly advancing Danish and Low German crusaders who had been able to conquer most of the area in the early 13th century. Defeat in the Battle of Lihula discouraged the Swedish expansion to Estonia for more than 300 years, and the country was left for the Teutonic Knights, Low German Bishops and Denmark to divide. In the meantime, Sweden focused on Finland and the Swedish-Novgorodian Wars. After the Livonian Crusade Läänemaa became the main territory of the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek, an independent Bishopric. Parts of the Bishop&#x27;s castle are still preserved in Haapsalu.

===Historic parishes (&quot;kihelkonnad&quot;)===
*Hanila
*Cozzo (Karuse)
*Corbe (Kõrve)
*Lihula
*Ridala
*Soontagana (:et:Soontagana)
*around Märjamaa

After the German conquest in 1227, Lääne County became the center of the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek, an independent principality within the Livonian Confederation. Parts of Bishop&#x27;s castle are still preserved in Haapsalu.

<doc id="395948" wikidata="Q18969" url="?curid=395948" title="Bicknell's thrush">
<text>Bicknell&#x27;s thrush (Catharus bicknelli) is a medium-sized thrush, at and . One of North America&#x27;s rarest and most localized songbirds, it breeds on coniferous mountain tops and disturbed habitats of northeastern North America. While very similar in appearance and vocalization to the gray-cheeked thrush (&quot;Catharus minimus&quot;), the two species, with two completely different breeding ranges, differ slightly in their morphology and vocalizations. It was named after Eugene Bicknell, an American amateur ornithologist, who made the first scientific discovery of the species on Slide Mountain in the Catskills in the late 19th century. John Burroughs, in his essay, &quot;The Heart of the Southern Catskills&quot; (1886), writes effusively about the voice of Bicknell&#x27;s thrush heard near the summit on his climbs of Slide Mountain, and how on his stays on Slide saw them nowhere else but &quot;about the summit&quot;, and saw no other thrush but Bicknell&#x27;s.

==Description==
Bicknell&#x27;s thrush is just slightly smaller than the other northern migratory &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes, with an average length of approximately and a weight ranging generally from 26 to 30g. Both sexes are identical in the field and are roughly the same size, although males average slightly larger in wing length. Adults are olive-brown to brownish on the upperparts (head, nape, back) contrasting with chestnut-tinged tail. The contrast is, however, less evident in worn plumage. The underparts are off-white with gray on the flanks; the breast is off-white with buffy wash, showing dusky spots that becomes more diffuse toward the sides and the lower breast. They have pink legs, a faint grey eye ring, and gray cheeks. Two-thirds of the lower mandible is yellow colored, while the tip of the lower mandible and upper mandible is blackish. They average slightly smaller than the very similar gray-cheeked thrush but are all but indistinguishable in outward appearance. The song is a jumbled series of flute-like tones ending on a higher note.

== Taxonomy ==
A member of the family Turdidae, Bicknell&#x27;s thrush belongs to the genus &quot;Catharus&quot;. This genus includes twelve species, five of which are found in North America. The closest relative of the Bicknell&#x27;s thrush is its sister species, the gray-cheeked thrush. Together, the gray-cheeked and Bicknell&#x27;s thrush form a cryptic species pair, and were indeed formerly considered conspecific. However, DNA analysis showed a divergence between the two species about 1 million years ago.

==Habitat and range==
Bicknell&#x27;s thrush scattered breeding range extends from southeastern Quebec to Nova Scotia in Canada and the sky islands of northern New England and the Adirondacks and Catskills in New York. It is the rarest and most secretive of the breeding thrushes in North America, and it is the only bird species whose breeding range is entirely restricted to the northeastern part of the continent. It is a habitat specialist in its breeding range. It is known to favor high altitude coniferous forests affected by strong winds and heavy ice conditions. They usually breed at higher elevations, normally nesting above . However, they do not only live in this habitat, they also inhabit successional forests that have recently been affected by the forest industry. Its habitat is therefore best characterized by highly disturbed forest, where trees are small and stunted.

Conversely, Bicknell&#x27;s thrush is more a habitat generalist in migration. The Bicknell&#x27;s and gray-cheeked thrushes, along with the veery, make up a close-knit group of migrant species. The birds migrate to the Greater Antilles, with an estimated 90% of the individuals wintering in Hispaniola (mostly in the Dominican Republic, but also Haiti). During the winter, they live in broadleaf forests at various elevations but generally preferring higher elevations. Wintering individuals have been recorded from the mountain ranges of the Cordillera Central, Sierra de Baoruco, and Cordillera Septentrional in the Dominican Republic, the Massif de la Hotte in Haiti, the Cordillera Central in Puerto Rico, the Blue Mountains in Jamaica, and the Sierra Maestra in eastern Cuba.

==Behavior==

=== Vocalization ===
Vocalizing mostly at dawn and dusk, the song is mostly performed by the male, but sometimes also by females. Like all North American thrushes, Bicknell&#x27;s thrush song is flute-like. High pitched and vibrant, the song is composed of four phrases: “&quot;chook-chook, wee-o, wee-o, wee-o-ti-t-ter-ee&quot;”. Unlike in the gray-cheeked thrush, the pitch of the last phrase is constant or rising.

The primary call is a downward whistle named the “Beer call” “&quot;beer”&quot;. Other calls include growl call given in alarm situations “&quot;crr-rr-rr&quot;” and flight call “&quot;cree-e-e&quot;”

 John Burroughs, in his essay, &quot;The Heart of the Southern Catskills&quot; (1886), writes effusively about the voice of Bicknell&#x27;s thrush heard near the summit on his climbs of Slide Mountain, and how on his stays on Slide saw them nowhere else but &quot;about the summit&quot;, and saw no other thrush but Bicknell&#x27;s. 

===Breeding===
Bicknell&#x27;s thrushes have an unusual mating system in which females mate with more than one male. Such a practice, known as polyandry, is not known to occur in other thrushes. As many as four males perform duties connected with one nest, including bringing food for the nestlings. It is possible that females decide to mate with more males when preys are less abundant. Pair formation is thought to occur after female arrival to breeding site in late May. The nest itself is typically a bulky cup made of twigs and moss, close to the trunk of a conifer at base of horizontal branches, usually 2 meters above ground. The female builds the nest alone and lay three or four eggs per clutch. While the incubation period is about two weeks, nestlings, fed by both parents, grow rapidly, developing in 12 days from peanut-sized hatchlings to completely feathered adult-sized birds.

=== Ecology ===
Ticks, blowflies, and lice are some of the parasites with which Bicknell&#x27;s thrush must contend. The American red squirrel is the main predator of eggs and nestlings, according to breeding ecology. Predators confirmed to hunt nesting adults have consisted of the sharp-shinned hawk, the long-tailed weasel, and the northern saw-whet owl. On the nesting grounds there are at least six other predators suspected or likely to depredate nests and at least three other predators that may attacks nesting adults, to say nothing of potential predators during migration or on wintering grounds.

===Diet===
The thrush&#x27;s diet consists mainly of insects, beetles and ants being the main preys. They also start eating wild fruits in late summer (mid-July), and continue to do so during migration, and on the wintering grounds. They forage on both insects and wild fruits in winter. They usually forage on the forest floor, but also catch flies, and glean insects from the foliage of trees. Individuals eating fruits on wintering ground forage higher in the tree than those eating insects. Foraging technique varies but Bicknell&#x27;s thrush mostly searches by pausing and peering, marked by hops and short flights. Sometimes food scratch on the ground, especially in wintering range.

==Conservation and threats==

=== Population monitoring ===
Mountain Birdwatch data suggest that Bicknell&#x27;s thrush populations have declined by an average of -3.88% per year (95% Bayesian credible interval: -5.27% to -2.52%) in northern New England and northeastern New York since 2010. The steepest declines (&gt;60% decline between 2010 and 2022, 95% Bayesian credible interval: -75.31% to -33.33%, ) were observed in the Catskill Mountains in New York, USA, the southernmost portion of the Bicknell&#x27;s thrush global breeding range. At that rate, it is possible that Bicknell&#x27;s thrush may be extirpated entirely from the Catskills by 2050, with an estimated population loss of &gt;95%. The Catskills, however, likely harbor less than 5% of the U.S. Bicknell&#x27;s thrush population. The species has already been extirpated from Massachusetts, with the last record there being on Mount Greylock. The U.S. population of Bicknell&#x27;s thrush is likely around 70,000, and the Canadian population estimated between 40,570 and 49,568, with a global population of less than 120,000. The species was considered a &quot;Special Concern&quot; species by Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada in April 1999. This was later re-examined to consider &quot;C. bicknelli&quot; &quot;Threatened&quot; in November 2009, and was re-assessed again as such in December 2022.

=== Threats ===
Its numbers are declining in some parts of its already limited range as a result of habitat degradation. Scientists believe that industrial pollution is one of the main reasons for the decline of the red spruce, an important element in Bicknell&#x27;s thrush habitat in the United States. Airborne heavy metals may also damage high-elevation forests in the northeastern United States. Furthermore, based on expected substantial carbon dioxide increases by the end of the century, scientists predict a radical reduction of balsam fir forest in the eastern United States and Canada. If average global temperatures increase and forests change as much as predicted, Bicknell&#x27;s thrush habitat is very likely to be altered in ways that may seriously affect the species&#x27; survival. Indeed, models predict that Bicknell&#x27;s thrush will lose more than 50% of its breeding habitat over the next 30 years. Furthermore, recreational development, telecommunication towers and windmills increase is a major cause of habitat fragmentation and deterioration.

Industrial forestry practices, although possibly harmful, may be modified to aid in conservation efforts to protect Bicknell&#x27;s thrush. While more study is needed, the bird&#x27;s apparent acceptance of certain commercial second-growth forest gives promise to possibilities of man-made &quot;growing&quot; Bicknell&#x27;s thrush habitats in the future.

Non-native species are potential risks throughout the thrush&#x27;s range; introduced moose on Cape Breton Island consume the saplings of the tree species birds breed on, and invasive brown and black rats in the Caribbean may pose a potential threat. With climate change shifting temperature up elevation on mountains, Bicknell&#x27;s thrush may suffer from asymmetrical and aggressive competition from the Swainson&#x27;s thrush (&quot;Catharus swainsoni).&quot;

Bicknell&#x27;s thrush has a higher concentration of mercury in its blood than any lower-elevation &quot;Catharus&quot; thrush. Mercury level increases greatly with altitude and its concentration bioaccumulate in the food web, probably explaining why it decreases as breeding season advances and birds begin to feed more on fruits. High mercury concentrations may cause reproductive impairment.

There is also considerable concern about the degradation of Bicknell&#x27;s thrush&#x27;s wintering habitats. The Dominican Republic&#x27;s native forests are under considerable pressure from naturally occurring events such as hurricanes, as well as changes from agricultural activities, particularly at low altitudes. The forested lands of Haiti have been almost eliminated, and in Cuba, most of the known suitable habitat exists only in protected parklands.

=== Management ===
Few management actions are known to be in place, even though management procedures for the species’ conservation have been established by the International Bicknell&#x27;s Thrush Conservation Group (IBTCG). Near ski trails, maintaining vegetation on edges in a gradual slope and keeping large forested “islands” between leaves better habitat for Bicknell&#x27;s thrush. Limiting vegetation management outside of the breeding season near mountain tops is another way to diminish disturbance. In areas where infrastructures are built in favorable Bicknell&#x27;s thrush habitat, restoration of non-permanent modifications in the environment by reforesting is recommended. Signs or barriers along trails leading to the infrastructure to minimize disturbance is another suggested measure. As regenerating forests are known to be a good habitat for this species, assuring a continuous forest regeneration after clear-cuts benefits Bicknell&#x27;s thrush. On winter range, reforestation of agricultural lands is proposed way to protect this declining thrush.

<text>Rapla County ( or &quot;Raplamaa&quot;) is one of the fifteen counties of Estonia. It is situated in the north-western part of the country and borders Järva County to the east, Pärnu County to the south, Lääne County to the west, and Harju County to the north. In 2022 Rapla County had a population of 33,529 – constituting 2.5% of the total population of Estonia.

== History ==
The first written records of Rapla date back to the 1241 Danish census (&quot;Liber Census Daniae&quot;).

== County government ==
The County Government (Estonian: &quot;Maavalitsus&quot;) is led by a governor (Estonian: &quot;maavanem&quot;), who is appointed by the Government of Estonia for a term of five years. Since 2015, the Governor position is held by Tõnis Blank.

== Municipalities ==

The county is subdivided into municipalities. There are 4 rural municipalities (Estonian: &quot;vallad&quot; – parishes) in Rapla County:

== Religion ==

== Geography ==
Natural resources found in Rapla county include limestone, dolomite, peat, and clay.

== Miscellaneous topics ==
The church of Rapla was built in 1901. However, much of the interior dates back to several hundred years earlier and is of high structural quality and historical value. In the churchyard there are several crosses remaining from the 17th century.

<text>The Lingdingyang Bridge () is a proposed bridge crossing the Lingdingyang, Pearl River estuary between the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai in Guangdong province. 

The bridge was originally proposed by the former Zhuhai prefecture mayor in the late 1980s as a link between Zhuhai and Hong Kong, with landing points at Qi&#x27;ao Island and Tuen Mun of the respective cities. The Qi&#x27;ao Bridge was completed in 1998 to link mainland Zhuhai with Qi&#x27;ao Island as part of the preliminary work for the proposed Lingdingyang bridge. Nonetheless the proposal was dropped to give way to the later-proposed Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which links Hong Kong at Lantau and Zhuhai at Gongbei, with a connection to Macau as well.

In November 2019, Zhuhai government announced plans for a Shenzhen-Zhuhai bridge, officially named the Lingdingyang Bridge. The bridge will start in Qianhai, Shenzhen and go towards Qi&#x27;ao Island, Zhuhai, and will be long. The cross-sea section of the bridge is planned to be both an expressway and a railway. A two-way eight-lane expressway and a four-lane railway with a designed speed of have been planned.

<doc id="395953" wikidata="Q4378204" url="?curid=395953" title="List of U.S. military vessels named after living Americans">
<text>The naming of United States Navy vessels after living people was common in the earliest years of American history, but as the 20th century began, the Navy had firmly established a practice of naming ships for people only after they had died. In 1969, a Navy panel formally decreed that warships would no longer be named after living persons. 

That lasted until 1974, when President Richard Nixon announced the naming of an aircraft carrier after United States Representative Carl Vinson. Over the next half-century, the Navy named more ships for living people than it had in the previous two centuries. From October 2020 to March 2023, the Navy named a ship for a living person every eight months, a pace unseen since 1776.

U.S. Navy ships are named by the Secretary of the Navy under U.S. law, explicitly until 1925 and implicitly since. 

No ships were named for living former Navy secretaries until 2001; since then, every Navy secretary save one has named a warship for a living predecessor, accounting for more than one-quarter of the ships they named for living people. 

No one has named more U.S. ships for living people than Ray Mabus, who did so eight times during his service as secretary from 2009 to 2017. &quot;I think it&#x27;s...important, when we can, to honor people who are still with us and thank them for what they did,&quot; Mabus said in 2016. 

The U.S. Navy generally announces the name of a ship some time before it is launched, and well before it is accepted for purchase and commissioned into active service.
==List of ships==
The following ships received their names while their namesakes were alive. The list includes several ships whose namesakes died before the ships were commissioned.

<text>Liverpool John Moores University (abbreviated LJMU) is a public research university in the city of Liverpool, England. The university can trace its origins to the Liverpool Mechanics&#x27; School of Arts, established in 1823. This later merged to become Liverpool Polytechnic. In 1992, following an Act of Parliament, the Liverpool Polytechnic became what is now Liverpool John Moores University. It is named after Sir John Moores, a local businessman and philanthropist, who donated to the university&#x27;s precursor institutions.

The university had students in , of which are undergraduate students and are postgraduate, making it the largest university in the UK by total student population.

It is a member of the MillionPlus, the Northern Consortium and the European University Association.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Founded as a small mechanics institution (Liverpool Mechanics&#x27; School of Arts) in 1823, the institution grew over the centuries by converging and amalgamating with different colleges, including the F. L. Calder School of Domestic Science, the C. F. Mott College of Education, before eventually becoming Liverpool Polytechnic in 1970. The university also has a long history of providing training, education and research to the maritime industry, dating back to the formation of the Liverpool Nautical College in 1892.

The institution then became a university under the terms of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 under the new title of &quot;Liverpool John Moores University&quot;. This new title was approved by the Privy Council on 15 September 1992. The university took its name from Sir John Moores, the founder of the Littlewoods empire. Moores was a great believer in the creation of opportunity for all, which embodies the ethos of LJMU in providing educational routes for people of all ages and from all backgrounds. This belief led Sir John Moores to invest in the institution and facilities, such as the John Foster Building (housing the Liverpool Business School), designed by and named after leading architect John Foster. With the institution&#x27;s backgrounds dating back as far as 1823, many of the university buildings date back also, with aesthetically pleasing Georgian and Victorian buildings found on a few of the campuses.

=== Present day ===

LJMU now has more than 27,000 students from over 100 countries world-wide, 2,400 staff and 250 degree courses. LJMU was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize in 2005.

Currently, Liverpool John Moores University is receiving more applications than previously seen; according to data in 2009, the total number of applications submitted to LJMU was 27,784.

On 28 March 2022, former student and founder of Mowgli, Nisha Katona was installed as Chancellor of the university. Previously, in 2008, astrophysicist and Queen lead guitarist Brian May was appointed the fourth Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University. He replaced outgoing Chancellor Cherie Blair, wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Honorary fellows in attendance at the ceremony included astronomer Sir Patrick Moore and actor Pete Postlethwaite. May was succeeded as Chancellor by judge Sir Brian Leveson in 2013.

LJMU is a founding member of the Northern Consortium, an educational charity owned by 11 universities in northern England.

== Campuses ==
The university is separated into two campuses in Liverpool:
* City Campus, mainly situated on Byrom Street and surrounding Great Crosshall Street up to Liverpool Exchange railway station, housing buildings such as the; James Parsons Building and Tithebarn Building, of the faculties of Science; Engineering and Technology and; Health.
* Mount Pleasant Campus, next to the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral and Liverpool University, containing the John Lennon Art and Design Building and home to the Faculty of Business and Law and the Faculty of Arts, Professional and Social Studies. The Liverpool Science Park is also regarded to be part of this campus.

Between the two campuses is the Copperas Hill Site, opened in summer 2021, containing many faculties moved from the former IM Marsh Campus, and home to the Student Life and LJMU Sports Buildings. Its location between the two sites has been described by the university to help connect both of its campuses together, and is not regarded to be part of either. It is however closer to the Mount Pleasant Campus and separated from the City Campus by the A5047, and Liverpool Lime Street railway station.

=== Libraries ===
There are currently two libraries operated by LJMU, one for either campus:

*The Aldham Robarts Library is part of the Mount Pleasant Campus, and provides for students studying at the Mount Pleasant Campus or otherwise residing in the central Knowledge Quarter area. The library is situated on Maryland Street and caters mainly for the Faculty of Business and Law and the Faculty of Media, Arts and Social Science.
*The Avril Robarts Library is part of the City Campus, and mainly provides services to students studying in the City Campus. It is located on Tithebarn Street, and covers three faculties: Faculty of Health, the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Technology and Environment. The library hosts the Superlambanana sculpture at its front.

There is an LRC present in the Learning Commons of the Student Life Building on the Copperas Hill site between the two campuses. 

Students of the university can use any library in term-time and some non-term time periods within the library&#x27;s opening hours. The Student Life Building is open 24/7 in term time. Students need their student identification card for entry to all buildings.

There are more than 68,500 books in the Libraries&#x27; collections, with 1,630 work spaces available for students 24 hours a day. In addition to this there are over 16,000 e-books and 5,000 e-journals available. It is a member of the Libraries Together: Liverpool Learning Partnership (evolved from Liverpool Libraries Group) which formed in 1990. Under which, a registered reader at any of the member libraries can have access rights to the other libraries within the partnership.

===Tom Reilly Building===
The Tom Reilly Building houses the School of Sports and Exercise Sciences and the School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, which are both part of the Faculty of Science. Some 8,000 students use the building which is located at LJMU&#x27;s City Campus on Byrom Street. The five storey, building was completed in November 2009 and opened in March 2010 by Liverpool F.C. captain Steven Gerrard. The building provides sports and science facilities including; appetite laboratories, psychology testing labs, neuroscience labs, an indoor 70-metre running track, force plates, caren disc, physiology suites, a DEXA scanner, a driving simulator and a chronobiology lab.

==Organisation and structure==

=== Faculties ===

The university is organised into five faculties (which are each split into schools or centres), most of the faculties are based at a particular campus site however, with many joint honours degrees and some conventional degrees, the faculties overlap meaning students&#x27; degrees are from both faculties. The five faculties are:

; Faculty of Business &amp; Law
* Liverpool Business School
* School of Law

; Faculty of Arts, Professional and Social Studies
* Liverpool School of Art and Design
* Liverpool Screen School
* School of Education
* School of Humanities and Social Science

===Governance===
==Academic profile==
LJMU is highly ranked for teaching and research in Sports and Exercise Sciences. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) awarded LJMU £4.5 million over five years for the establishment of a Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL). The CETL award recognises LJMU&#x27;s record for Physical Education, Dance, Sport and Exercises Sciences. LJMU is the only United Kingdom university to be awarded an Ofsted Grade A in Physical Education and it is also the premier institution for both teaching and research in Sport and Exercise Sciences.

===Business School===
Liverpool Business School (LBS) is located in the Redmonds Building on the Mount Pleasant Campus and has over 2,500 students and 100 academics.

LBS offers undergraduate, postgraduate (including an Executive MBA) and research based programmes. Research areas include International Banking, Economics and Finance, Sustainable Enterprise, Public Service Management, Development of Modern Economic Thought, Performance Management, Marketing, Project Management, and Market Research.

=== Research ===

In the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), LJMU reported notable research strengths in general engineering and sports-related sciences. By the 2008 RAE, LJMU was the top-performing post-92 university for Anthropology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, General Engineering, Physics (Astrophysics) and Sports-Related Studies. According to the UK Research Assessment Exercise 2014 (RAE 2014), LJMU every unit of assessment submitted was rated as at least 45% internationally excellent or better. In 2012, the university&#x27;s scientist published notable research suggesting that the dinosaur&#x27;s extinction may have been caused by increased methane production from the dinosaurs, with some informally saying that dinosaurs &quot;farted&quot; their way to extinction.

=== Rankings ===
Liverpool John Moores University was included in the new 2013 Times Higher Education 100 under 50, ranking 72 out of 100. The list aims to show the rising stars in the global academy under the age of 50 years.

First Destination Survey results show that 89% of LJMU graduates are in employment or undertaking postgraduate study within six months of graduating.

==Student life==
=== Students&#x27; Union ===
Students at the university are represented by the John Moores Students&#x27; Union.

Representation for all students is central and is conducted by executive officers elected annually. In most cases, these students will be on a sabbatical from their studies. The election process is normally contested in mid April, successful candidates assuming office the following academic year.

=== Sports ===
Liverpool John Moores University has BUCS-registered teams in badminton, basketball, cricket, football, cycling, hockey, netball, rugby league, rugby union, tennis, volleyball, swimming, and American football. Many of the sports teams compete in BUCS competitions. Liverpool Students&#x27; Union has 15 BUCS sports, from which 36 teams run, catering for over 800 athletes. In recent years, LJMU students have competed for BUCS representative squads, in national finals and at World University Championships. In addition, the Students&#x27; Union also runs intramural sports leagues.
The university also enjoys success at national and world level. Gymnast Beth Tweddle studied at LJMU and has achieved national, Commonwealth, European, and World medals whilst also competing at the Olympic Games.

<text>A subtle body is a &quot;quasi material&quot; aspect of the human body, being neither solely physical nor solely spiritual, according to various esoteric, occult, and mystical teachings. This contrasts with the mind–body dualism that has dominated Western thought. The subtle body is important in the Taoism of China and Dharmic religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, mainly in the branches which focus on tantra and yoga, where it is known as the &quot;Sūkṣma-śarīra&quot; (). However, while mostly associated with Asian cultures, non-dualistic approaches to the mind and body are found in many parts of the world.

Subtle body concepts and practices can be identified as early as 2nd century BCE in Taoist texts found in the Mawangdui tombs. It was &quot;evidently present&quot; in Indian thought as early as the 4th to 1st century BCE when the Taittiriya Upanishad described the Panchakoshas, a series of five interpenetrating sheaths of the body. A fully formed subtle body theory did not develop in India until the tantric movement that affected all its religions in the Middle Ages. In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, the correlation of the subtle body to the physical body is viewed differently according to school, lineage and scholar, but for completion stage in yoga, it is visualised within the body. The subtle body consists of focal points, often called chakras, connected by channels, often called nadis, that convey subtle breath, often called prana. Through breathing and other exercises, a practitioner may direct the subtle breath to achieve supernormal powers, immortality, or liberation.

Subtle body in the Western tradition is called the &quot;body of light&quot;. The concept derives from the philosophy of Plato: the word &#x27;astral&#x27; means &#x27;of the stars&#x27;; thus the astral plane consists of the Seven Heavens of the classical planets. Neoplatonists Porphyry and Proclus elaborated on Plato&#x27;s description of the starry nature of the human psyche. Throughout the Renaissance, philosophers and alchemists, healers including Paracelsus and his students, and natural scientists such as John Dee, continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between earth and the divine. The concept of the astral body or body of light was adopted by 19th and 20th-century ceremonial magicians.

The Theosophy movement was the first to translate the Sanskrit term as &#x27;subtle body&#x27;, although their use of the term is quite different from Indic usage as they synthesize Western and Eastern traditions. This makes the term problematic for modern scholars, especially as the Theosophist view often influences New Age and holistic medicine perspectives. Western scientists have started to explore the subtle body concept in research on meditation.

==Asian religions==
The Yogic, Tantric and other systems of Hinduism, Vajrayana Buddhism, as well as Chinese Taoist alchemy contain theories of subtle physiology with focal points (chakras, acupuncture points) connected by a series of channels (nadis, meridians) that convey subtle breath (prana, vayu, ch&#x27;i, ki, lung). These invisible channels and points are understood to determine the characteristics of the visible physical form. By understanding and mastering the subtlest levels of reality one gains mastery over the physical realm. Through breathing and other exercises, the practitioner aims to manipulate and direct the flow of subtle breath, to achieve supernormal powers &quot;(siddhis)&quot; and attain higher states of consciousness, immortality, or liberation.

=== Hinduism ===

==== Early ====
Early concepts of the subtle body (Sanskrit: &quot;sūkṣma śarīra&quot;) appeared in the Upanishads, including the &quot;Brhadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; and the &quot;Katha Upanishad&quot;. The &quot;Taittiriya Upanishad&quot; describes the theory of five koshas or sheaths, though these are not to be thought of as concentric layers, but interpenetrating at successive levels of subtlety:

* The &quot;anna-maya&quot; (&quot;food body&quot;, physical body, the grossest level),
* The &quot;prana-maya&quot; (body made of vital breath or prana), 
* The &quot;mano-maya&quot; (body made of mind), 
* The &quot;vijñana-maya&quot; (body made of consciousness)
* The &quot;ananda-maya&quot; (bliss body, the subtlest level).

Subtle internal anatomy included a central channel (nadi). Later Vedic texts called samhitas and brahmanas contain a theory of five &quot;winds&quot; or &quot;breaths&quot; (&quot;vayus, pranas&quot;):

* &quot;Prāṇa&quot;, associated with inhalation
* &quot;Uḍāna&quot;, associated with exhalation
* &quot;Vyāna&quot;, associated with distribution of breath within the body
* &quot;Samāna&quot;, associated with digestion
* &quot;Apāna&quot;, associated with excretion of waste

==== Later ====
A millennium later, these concepts were adapted and refined by various spiritual traditions. The similar concept of the is seen as the vehicle of consciousness in later Samkhya, Vedanta, and Yoga, and is propelled by past-life tendencies, or &quot;bhavas&quot;. Linga can be translated as &quot;characteristic mark&quot; or &quot;impermanence&quot; and the Vedanta term sarira as &quot;form&quot; or &quot;mould&quot;. &quot;Karana&quot; or &quot;instrument&quot; is a synonymous term. In the Classical Samkhya system of Isvarakrsna (ca. 4th century CE), the &quot;Lińga&quot; is the characteristic mark of the transmigrating entity. It consists of twenty-five tattvas from eternal consciousness down to the five organs of sense, five of activity (&quot;buddindriya&quot; or &quot;jñānendriya&quot;, and &quot;karmendriya&quot; respectively) and the five subtle elements that are the objects of sense (&quot;tanmatras&quot;) The &quot;Samkhyakarika&quot; says:

The classical Vedanta tradition developed the theory of the five bodies into the theory of the koshas &quot;sheaths&quot; or &quot;coverings&quot; which surround and obscure the self (atman). In classical Vedanta these are seen as obstacles to realization and traditions like Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedanta had little interest in working with the subtle body.

==== Tantra ====
In Tantra traditions meanwhile (Shaiva Kaula, Kashmir Shaivism and Buddhist Vajrayana), the subtle body was seen in a more positive light, offering potential for yogic practices which could lead to liberation. Tantric traditions contain the most complex theories of the subtle body, with sophisticated descriptions of energy nadis (literally &quot;stream or river&quot;, channels through which &quot;vayu&quot; and &quot;prana&quot; flows) and chakras, points of focus where nadis meet.

The main channels, shared by both Hindu and Buddhist systems, but visualised entirely differently, are the central (in Hindu systems: &quot;sushumna&quot;; in Buddhist: &quot;avadhuti&quot;), left and right (in Hindu systems: &quot;ida&quot; and &quot;pingala&quot;; Buddhist: &quot;lalana&quot; and &quot;rasana&quot;). Further subsidiary channels are said to radiate outwards from the chakras, where the main channels meet.

Chakra systems vary with the tantra; the &quot;Netra Tantra&quot; describes six chakras, the &quot;Kaulajñana-nirnaya&quot; describes eight, and the &quot;Kubjikamata Tantra&quot; describes seven (the most widely known set).

In the Dzogchen tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the subtle body takes a different form. More specifically, the tradition points to four areas of particularly concentration of bodily energy – viz. the heart (&quot;tsitta&quot;), where the enlightened energy resides; the &quot;luminous channels&quot; (&quot;‘od rtsa&quot;), through which the energy flows; the skull (&quot;dung khang&quot;), where it spreads before finally being released through the fourth hot-spot, namely the eyes (&quot;tsakshu&quot; / &quot;briguta&quot;). Flavio Geisshuesler, who has studied the functioning of the Dzogchen subtle body in the context of the practice of sky-gazing, argues that many of the specific motifs that appear in the tradition&#x27;s conception of the body are of pre-Buddhist origin. More specifically, he notes that the Dzogchen body&#x27;s motifs of &quot;deer-hearts, silk-channels, buffalo-horns, or far-reaching lassos [...] reproduce the terminology of the hunting of animalistic vitality as if internalizing the quest for precious substances.&quot;

==== Modern ====

The modern Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba stated that the subtle body &quot;is the vehicle of desires and vital forces&quot;. He held that the subtle body is one of three bodies with which the soul must cease to identify with in order to realize God.

===Buddhism===

In Buddhist Tantra, the subtle body is termed the &quot;innate body&quot; () or the &quot;uncommon means body&quot; (&quot;asadhdrana-upayadeha&quot;), or , rendered in Tibetan as &quot;traway-lu&quot; (transliterated &quot;phra ba’i lus&quot;). The subtle body is sometimes known as , the “body made of mind” and is the means for synchronising the body and the mind, particularly during meditation.

The subtle body consists of thousands of subtle energy channels (nadis), which are conduits for energies or &quot;winds&quot; (lung or prana) and converge at chakras. According to Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, there are three main channels (&quot;nadis&quot;), central, left and right, which run from the point between the eyebrows up to the crown chakra, and down through all seven chakras to a point two inches below the navel.

Lati Rinbochay describes the subtle body as consisting of 72,000 channels, various winds and a white and a red drop whilst a further very subtle body is a wind abiding in a drop at the centre of the heart chakra. The central channel is then described as being squeezed by two channels that encircle it at each chakra and thrice at the heart chakra, ensuring the winds do not move upward or downward until death.

Buddhist tantras generally describe four or five chakras in the shape of a lotus with varying petals. For example, the Hevajra Tantra (8th century) states:In the Center [i.e. chakra] of Creation [at the sexual organ] a sixty-four petal lotus. In the Center of Essential Nature [at the heart] an eight petal lotus. In the Center of Enjoyment [at the throat] a sixteen petal lotus. In the Center of Great Bliss [at the top of the head] a thirty-two petal lotus.In contrast, the historically later Kalachakra tantra describes six chakras.

In Vajrayana Buddhism, liberation is achieved through subtle body processes during Completion Stage practices such as the Six Yogas of Naropa.

=== Other traditions ===
Other spiritual traditions teach about a mystical or divine body, such as &quot;the most sacred body&quot; (&quot;wujud al-aqdas&quot;) and &quot;true and genuine body&quot; (&quot;jism asli haqiqi&quot;) in Sufism, the meridian system in Chinese religion, and &quot;the immortal body&quot; (&quot;soma athanaton&quot;) in Hermeticism.

== Western esoteric tradition ==
The &quot;body of light&quot; is elaborated on according to various Western esoteric, occult, and mystical teachings. Other terms used for this body include &quot;body of glory&quot;, &quot;spirit-body&quot;, &quot;radiant body&quot;, &quot;luciform body&quot;, &quot;augoeides&quot; (&#x27;radiant&#x27;), &quot;astroeides&quot; (&#x27;starry&#x27; or &#x27;sidereal body&#x27;), and &quot;celestial body&quot;.

The concept derives from the philosophy of Plato: the word &#x27;astral&#x27; means &#x27;of the stars&#x27;; thus the astral plane consists of the Seven Heavens of the classical planets. The idea is rooted in common worldwide religious accounts of the afterlife in which the soul&#x27;s journey or &quot;ascent&quot; is described in such terms as &quot;an ecstatic, mystical or out-of body experience, wherein the spiritual traveller leaves the physical body and travels in their body of light into &#x27;higher&#x27; realms.&quot;

Neoplatonists Porphyry and Proclus elaborated on Plato&#x27;s description of the starry nature of the human psyche. Throughout the Renaissance, philosophers and alchemists, healers including Paracelsus and his students, and natural scientists such as John Dee, continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between earth and the divine. The concept of the astral body or body of light was adopted by 19th-century ceremonial magician Éliphas Lévi, Florence Farr and the magicians of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, including Aleister Crowley.

== Western syncretic tradition ==

=== Theosophy ===
In the 19th century, H. P. Blavatsky founded the esoteric religious system of Theosophy, which attempted to restate Hindu and Buddhist philosophy for the Western world. She adopted the phrase &quot;subtle body&quot; as the English equivalent of the Vedantic &quot;sūkṣmaśarīra&quot;, which in Adi Shankara&#x27;s writings was one of three bodies (physical, subtle, and causal). Geoffrey Samuel notes that theosophical use of these terms by Blavatsky and later authors, especially C. W. Leadbeater, Annie Besant and Rudolf Steiner (who went on to found Anthroposophy), has made them &quot;problematic&quot; to modern scholars, since the Theosophists adapted the terms as they expanded their ideas based on &quot;psychic and clairvoyant insights&quot;, changing their meaning from what they had in their original context in India.
=== Post-theosophists ===

The later theosophical arrangement was taken up by Alice Bailey, and from there found its way into the New Age worldview and the human aura. Other authors treated the subtle body in varying ways. Max Heindel divided the subtle body into the Vital Body made of Ether; the Desire body, related to the Astral plane; and the Mental body. Barbara Brennan&#x27;s account of the subtle bodies in her books &quot;Hands of Light&quot; and &quot;Light Emerging&quot; refers to the subtle bodies as &quot;layers&quot; in the &quot;Human Energy Field&quot; or aura.

=== Fourth Way ===
Subtle bodies are found in the &quot;Fourth Way&quot; teachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, who write that one can create a subtle body, and hence achieve post-mortem immortality, through spiritual or yogic exercises. The &quot;soul&quot; in these systems is not something one is born with, but developed through esoteric practice to acquire complete understanding and to perfect the self. According to the historian Bernice Rosenthal, &quot;In Gurdjieff&#x27;s cosmology our nature is tripartite and is composed of the physical (planetary), emotional (astral) and mental (spiritual) bodies; in each person one of these three bodies ultimately achieves dominance.&quot; The &quot;divine body&quot; represents a fourth way, and the ultimate task of the teachings is to harmoniously develop the four ways into a single way.

== Meditation research ==
Western scientists have started to explore the subtle body concept in relation to research on meditation. The subtle body model can be cross-referenced onto modern maps of the central nervous system, and applied in research on meditation.

<text>The AC Ace is a sports car produced by AC Cars of Thames Ditton, England, from 1953 until 1963. About 220 AC Aces and 466 Ace-Bristol cars were produced during its 10 year run.

==History==
AC came back to the market after the Second World War with the 2-Litre range of cars in 1947, but it was with the Ace sports car of 1953 that the company really made its reputation in the post war years. Casting around for a replacement for the ageing 2-Litre, AC took up a design by John Tojeiro that used a light, ladder-type tubular frame, all independent transverse leaf spring suspension, and an open two-seater alloy body made using English wheeling machines, possibly inspired by the Ferrari 166 MM barchetta.

Early cars used AC&#x27;s elderly two-litre overhead cam straight-six engine (first seen soon after the end of the First World War), which, according to a 1954 road test by &quot;Motor&quot; magazine, gave a top speed of and in 11.4 seconds and a fuel consumption of . It was hardly a sporting engine however, and it was felt that something more modern and powerful was required to put the modern chassis to good use.

Joining the Ace in 1954 was the Aceca hard top coupé, which had an early form of hatchback rear door but used the same basic timber framed alloy body.

From 1956, there was the option of Bristol Cars&#x27; two-litre straight-six with 3 downdraught carburettors and slick four-speed gearbox. Top speed leapt to with in the nine second bracket. Overdrive was available from 1956 and front disc brakes were an option from 1957, although they were later standardised.
In 1961 a new 2.6-litre () straight-six &#x27;Ruddspeed&#x27; option was available, adapted by Ken Rudd from the unit used in the Ford Zephyr. It used three Weber or SU carburettors and either a &#x27;Mays&#x27; or an iron cast head. This setup boosted the car&#x27;s performance further, with some versions tuned to , providing a top speed of and in 8.1 seconds. However, it was not long before Carroll Shelby drew AC&#x27;s attention to the Cobra, so only 37 of the 2.6 models were made. These Ford engined models had a smaller grille which was carried over to the Cobra.

For the Ace as well as the Aceca, AC used chassis numbers beginning with AE for AC-engined cars, BE for Bristol-engined ones, and RS for those equipped with the Ford unit. An &quot;X&quot; following the first two letters indicated an export model. With the engine set well back in the chassis, the Ace handled well and was successful in competition.

==Motorsport==
The car raced at Le Mans in 1957 and 1958. In the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ted Whiteaway and John Turner drove their AC Ace Bristol, registration 650BPK, to the finish, claiming top honours for the 2,000cc GT class and seventh overall behind six 3 litre cars. Few cars with this provenance have survived and are extremely valuable. They can range from $100,000 or more for an unrestored car, even one in pieces, to in excess of $400,000 for a restored AC Ace.

==AC Cobra==

When Bristol ceased building their 6-cylinder engine in 1961, AC&#x27;s owner, Charles Hurlock, was approached by Carroll Shelby to use a Ford V8 in the Ace chassis, producing the AC Cobra in 1962. Production of the Ace ended the same year. The AC Cobra came in small block and later big block configurations. It was Ford&#x27;s 289 that powered the winning car in the GT class at Le Mans in June 1964. At the time, the AC Cobra 427 was the fastest &quot;production&quot; car in the world.

==AC Automotive==

AC Automotive, based in Straubenhardt, Germany, built AC cars under the original name from 2010 to mid-2023. Cars were sold in Germany, France and England, with sales in Luxembourg, Holland, Lichtenstein, Switzerland, and Belgium slated for the future. Pricing for the standard ACGT model starts at £104,400 before options. The AC Automotive company went into liquidation on July 24, 2023.

==Replicas==
As with the Cobra, some AC Ace replicas have been made, such as the Hawk Ace, but are much rarer.

<text>Iligan, officially the City of Iligan (; Maranao: &quot;Bandar a Iligan&quot;; ), is a highly urbanized city in the region of Northern Mindanao, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 363,115 people making it the second most populous city in Northern Mindanao after Cagayan de Oro.

It is the largest city in the province of Lanao del Norte both in population and land area wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the Philippine Statistics Authority, but administered independently from the province. It was once part of Central Mindanao (Region 12) until the province was moved under Northern Mindanao (Region 10) in 2001. Iligan is approximately 90 kilometers away from the capital of the province, Tubod, and approximately 800 kilometers from the capital of the Philippines, Manila.

Iligan has a total land area of , making it one of the 10 largest cities in the Philippines in terms of land area. Among the 33 highly urbanized cities of the Philippines, Iligan is the third-least dense, with a population density of 421 inhabitants per square kilometer, just behind Butuan and Puerto Princesa.

== Etymology ==
The name Iligan is from the Higaunon (Lumad/Native of Iligan) word &quot;Ilig&quot; which means &quot;to go downstream&quot;. However, some also claim that the name of Iligan was taken and inspired by the Higaunon term &quot;iligan&quot; or &quot;ilijan&quot;, which means &quot;fortress of defense&quot;, an appropriate term due to frequent attacks incurred by pirates as well as other Mindanao tribes.

==History==
===Higaonon Manobo settlement of Bayug===
Iligan was first settled by Higaonon Manobos on Bayug island, now in Barangay Hinaplanon, four kilometres north of the present city centre. It was a settlement of sea dwellers.

In Dapitan, &quot;Datu&quot; Pagbuaya of Panglao received the Spaniard Miguel Lopez de Legazpi&#x27;s agents in 1565. Later, Pagbuaya&#x27;s son Manooc was baptized as &quot;Don Pedro Manuel&quot; Manooc. Sometime afterward by the end of the 16th century, Manooc subdued the Higaonon Manobo settlement of Bayug and turned it into one of the earliest Christian settlements in the Philippines.

=== Spanish rule ===

Although Bayug survived other raids from other enemies, especially Muslims from Lanao, the early settlers and Christian converts moved their settlement from Bayug to Iligan, which the Augustinian Recollects founded in 1609. During Christianization, the Spaniards in Iligan received a hundred Spanish soldiers.

The Jesuits replaced the Recollects in 1639. Iligan was the Spaniards&#x27; base of operations in attempting to conquer and Christianize the Lake Lanao area throughout its history. A stone fort called Fort St. Francis Xavier was built in 1642 where Iliganons sought refuge during raids by bandits. But the fort sank due to floods. Another fort was built and this was named Fort Victoria or Cota de Iligan.

In 1850, because of floods, Don Remigio Cabili, then Iligan&#x27;s gobernadorcillo, built another fort and moved the poblacion of the old Iligan located at the mouth of Tubod River west of the old market to its present site.

Being the oldest town in Northern Mindanao, Iligan was already a part of the once undivided Misamis Province by the year 1832. However, it did not have an independent religious administration because its diocese by then was based at Misamis, the provincial capital. It was one of the biggest municipalities of Misamis Province.

The Spaniards abandoned Iligan in 1899, paving the way for the landing of the American forces in 1900.

===American rule===


In 1903, the Moro Province was created. Iligan, because of its Moro residents, was taken away from the Misamis Province. Then, Iligan became the capital of the Lanao District and the seat of the government where the American officials lived and held office. Later in 1907, the capital of the Lanao District has transferred to Dansalan.

In 1914, under the restructuring of Moroland after the end of the Moro Province (1903–1913), Iligan became a municipality composed of eight barrios together with the municipal district of Mandulog. After enjoying peace and prosperity for about 40 years, Iligan was invaded by Japanese forces in 1942.

The liberation of Iligan by the Philippine Commonwealth forces attacked by the Japanese held sway in the city until 1944 to 1945 when the war ended. On November 15, 1944, the city held a Commonwealth Day parade to celebrate the end of Japanese atrocities and occupation.

===After WW2===
===Establishment of the Iligan Steel Mill===
The Iligan Steel Mill was established in 1952 as a government-initiated project of the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation (NASSCO). After NASSCO applied for a $62.3 million loan from the United States–based Eximbank to fund projects, the latter suggested a transfer of the facilities&#x27; management to the private entity. The company was sold in 1963 to Iligan Integrated Steel Mills, Inc. of the Jacinto family.

===Cityhood===

Using the same territorial definition as a municipality, Iligan became a chartered city of Lanao del Norte on June 16, 1950. It was declared a first-class city in 1969 and was reclassified as First Class City &quot;A&quot; on July 1, 1977, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 465. In 1983, Iligan was again reclassified as a highly urbanized city.

===Rising conflicts during the late 1960s===

The election of Ferdinand Marcos as President of the Philippines saw a large influx of Christian groups settling in Mindanao, displacing many locals and resulting in numerous land ownership conflicts. The Marcos administration encouraged these new settlers to form militias, which were eventually nicknamed the Ilaga. The Ilaga were often associated with committed human rights abuses targeted at the Moro and Lumad people. This resulted in a lingering animosity and a cycle of violence between Moro and Christian communities which still persists today. Despite this local violence, prominent Moro thought leaders were mostly not politically active until the news of the 1968 Jabidah massacre ignited the Moro insurgency. Reports of Moro men being recruited into the Philippine Army and then being massacred when they had a dispute with their commanding officers led to the conviction that Moros were being treated as second class citizens. Ethnic tensions arising from this led to the formation of secessionist political movements, such as Cotabato Governor Datu Udtog Matalam&#x27;s Muslim Independence Movement and Lanao del Sur congressman Haroun al-Rashid Lucman&#x27;s Bangsamoro Liberation Organization.
Additionally, the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis led to social unrest throughout the country, and violent crackdowns on protests led to the radicalization of many students, with some joining the New People&#x27;s Army, bringing the New People&#x27;s Army rebellion to Mindanao for the first time.

===Iligan during martial law and Marcos administration===

Towards the end of the last term allowed to him by the Philippine Constitution, Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in 1972, which had the effect of further increasing tensions in Mindanao. It marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one-man rule, historically remembered for its human rights abuses In Iligan, one incident documented by a 1975 fact finding mission of Amnesty International documented the killing of twelve detainees, which was staged the incident to make it look like a prison break. The witness was himself detained without a warrant at the time, and was regularly being subjected to torture and forced labor.

The proclamation of Martial law also helped escalate the moro secessionist situation by banning political parties and organizations. The formal establishment of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) one month after Marcos&#x27; proclamation of Martial Law thus marked a shift to a more military phase of the Moro conflict, taking in the members of the former BMLO, and attracting members who had become dissatisfied with the MIM. Lanao del Sur and Iligan itself were deeply affected by the conflict, with the Armed Forces of the Philippines&#x27; conflicts with MNLF and its later splinter group the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) affecting combatants and civilians alike.

Aside from political groups, Marcos&#x27; proclamation of Martial law also shuttered press outlets - television stations, national newspapers, weekly magazines, community newspapers, and radio stations - throughout the country, including in Iligan and Lanao del Sur. The 14 years of the Marcos dictatorship saw the killings of many Mindanao journalists, with prominent examples being Bulletin Today Lanao provincial correspondent Demosthenes Dingcong, Philippine Post Iligan correspondent and radio commentator Geoffrey Siao, and DXWG Iligan commentator Charlie Aberilla.

Numerous activists arose from Iligan during the 1970s, despite significant personal risks. These included Iligan natives such as prominent Nurse empowerment advocate Minda Luz Quesada (who would later be invited to the Philippines&#x27; 1987 Constitutional Convention); Electrical workers&#x27; union leader David S. Borja; religious youth organizer Edwin Laguerder; activist professor and writer Ester Kintanar of the MSU Iligan Institute of Technology; and even activist politicians such as Masiding Alonto Sr. who was a prominent supporter of opposition leader Ninoy Aquino. Some of these activists were eventually killed in the pursuit of their beliefs, including farm workers organizers James Orbe and Herbert Cayunda.

Dingcong, Quezada, Borja, Kintanar, Laguerder, Alonto Sr., Orbe, and Cayunda were all later recognized by having their names inscribed on the Wall of Remembrance of the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors those who fought for the restoration of democracy and against the authoritarian regime of the time.

===Contemporary history===
===Asian financial crisis and recovery===

During the 1997 Asian financial crisis Iligan City experienced a severe economic slowdown. A number of industrial plants were closed, most notably the National Steel Corporation. 

The city began to see some economic recovery with the reopening of the National Steel Corporation, which was renamed Global Steelworks Infrastructures, Inc. (GSII) in 2004. This reopening marked a critical turning point for Iligan, as it restored a significant number of jobs and revitalized the local economy. The re-establishment of steel production brought renewed hope and stability to the community, encouraging further investments and business activities in the region.

In October 2005, GSII officially took a new corporate name: Global Steel Philippines (SPV-AMC), Inc. This rebranding was part of a broader strategy to rejuvenate the company’s operations and re-establish its presence in the steel industry both locally and internationally. The transition signified not only a change in name but also a commitment to modernizing the plant&#x27;s facilities and improving production processes to compete effectively in the global market.

===Lone district===
Republic Act No. 9724, an Act separating the City of Iligan from the First Legislative District of the Province of Lanao del Norte was approved, by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on October 20, 2009. This legislative change elevated Iligan to the status of a lone congressional district, providing it with greater political autonomy and representation. The creation of a separate legislative district allowed Iligan to have its own representative in the Philippine Congress, ensuring that the city&#x27;s specific needs and interests were more effectively addressed at the national level.

This move was seen as a step towards fostering greater local governance and development. It enabled the city to receive more focused attention and resources from the national government, which in turn could help drive further economic recovery and growth. By having its own legislative district, Iligan could better advocate for policies and programs tailored to its unique economic and social landscape, promoting sustainable development and improved quality of life for its residents.

==Geography==
Iligan is bounded on the north by three municipalities of Misamis Oriental (namely Lugait, Manticao and Opol), to the south by three municipalities of Lanao del Norte (Baloi, Linamon and Tagoloan) and two municipalities of Lanao del Sur (Kapai and Tagoloan II), to the north-east by the city of Cagayan de Oro, to the east by the municipality of Talakag, Bukidnon; and to the west by Iligan Bay.

To the west, Iligan Bay provides ferry and container ship transportation. East of the city, flat cultivated coastal land gives way to steep volcanic hills and mountains providing the waterfalls and cold springs for which the area is well known.

===Climate===
Iligan falls within the third type of climate wherein the seasons are not very pronounced. Rain is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. Because of its tropical location, the city does not experience cold weather. Neither does it experience strong weather disturbances due to its geographical location (being outside the typhoon belt) And also because of the mountains that are surrounding the city.

<text>Symon Vasyliovych Petliura (; – 25 May 1926) was a Ukrainian politician and journalist. He was the Supreme Commander of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army (UNA) and led the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic during the Ukrainian War of Independence, a part of the wider Russian Civil War.

Petliura was born to a family of Cossack heritage in Poltava. From an early age he embraced socialism and Ukrainian nationalism, which he advocated through his highly prolific career as a journalist. After the 1917 February Revolution overthrew the Tsarist monarchy, the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was proclaimed and Petliura was elected head of its military. The Republic was briefly interrupted by the pro-German Ukrainian State, but in late 1918 Petliura, along with other members of the socialist Directorate of Ukraine, organised a revolt and overthrew the regime, restoring the Republic. He became the leader of the Directorate in early 1919, after the Bolsheviks invaded Ukraine and drove the UNA to Galicia. Facing imminent defeat, Petliura entered an alliance with Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s Poland. The Polish–Soviet War concluded with Polish victory but Ukraine remained under Soviet control, forcing Petliura into exile. He initially directed the government-in-exile from Poland, but eventually settled in Paris.

During the Civil War, the UNA were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Jewish civilians, and Petliura&#x27;s role in the pogroms has been a topic of dispute. In 1926, Petliura was assassinated in Paris by Jewish anarchist Sholem Schwarzbard, who had lost relatives in the pogroms.
== Career to 1917 ==

Born on in a suburb of Poltava (then part of the Russian Empire), Symon Petliura was the son of Vasyl Pavlovych Petliura and Olha Oleksiyivna (née Marchenko), of Cossack background. His father, a Poltava city resident, had owned a transportation business; his mother was a daughter of an Orthodox hieromonk (priest-monk). Petliura obtained his initial education in parochial schools, and planned to become an Orthodox priest.

Petliura studied in the Russian Orthodox Seminary in Poltava from 1895 to 1901. While there he joined the Hromada society in 1898. When his membership in Hromada was discovered in 1901, he was expelled from the seminary. In 1900 Petliura joined the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party (RUP). In 1902, under threat of arrest, he moved to Yekaterinodar in the Kuban, where he worked for two years – initially as a schoolteacher and later as an archivist for the Kuban Cossack Host helping to organize over 200,000 documents. In December 1903 he was arrested for organizing a RUP branch in Yekaterinodar and for publishing inflammatory anti-tsarist articles in the Ukrainian press outside of Imperial Russia (in Austrian-controlled Lemberg, currently named Lviv, in Galicia). Released on bail in March 1904, he moved briefly to Kyiv and then to Lemberg.

In Lviv, Petliura lived under the name of Sviatoslav Tagon, working alongside Ivan Franko and Volodymyr Hnatiuk as an editor for the journal &#x27; (&quot;Literary Scientific Herald&quot;), the Shevchenko Scientific Society and as a co-editor of &#x27; newspaper. He also contributed numerous articles to the Ukrainian-language press in Galicia.

At the end of 1905, after an nationwide amnesty was declared by the authorities, Petliura returned briefly to Kyiv, but soon moved to the Russian capital of Petersburg in order to publish the socialist-democratic monthly magazine &quot;Vil’na Ukrayina&quot; (&quot;Free Ukraine&quot;) along with and Mykola Porsh. After Russian censors closed this magazine in July 1905, he moved back to Kyiv where he worked for the newspaper &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Council&quot;). In 1907–09 he became the editor of the literary magazine &quot;Slovo&quot; (, &quot;The Word&quot;) and co-editor of &quot;Ukrayina&quot; (, &quot;Ukraine&quot;).

Because of the closure of these publications by the Russian Imperial authorities, Petliura had once again to move from Kyiv. He went to Moscow in 1909, where he worked briefly as an accountant. There in 1910 he married Olha Bilska (1885–1959), with whom he had a daughter, Lesia (1911–1942). From 1912 until May 1917, he served as a co-editor of the influential Russian-language journal &quot;&quot; (&quot;Ukrainian Life&quot;).
==Journalism and publications==

As the editor of numerous journals and newspapers, Petliura published over 15,000 critical articles, reviews, stories and poems under an estimated 120 noms-de-plume. His prolific work in both the Russian and Ukrainian languages helped shape the mindset of the Ukrainian population in the years leading up to the Revolution in both Eastern and Western Ukraine. His prolific correspondence was of great benefit when the Revolution broke out in 1917, as he had contacts throughout Ukraine.

===Publications before 1914===
As the Ukrainian language had been outlawed in the Russian Empire by the Ems Ukaz of 1876, Petliura found more freedom to publish Ukraine oriented articles in Saint Petersburg than in Ukraine. There, he published the magazine &quot;Vilna Ukrayina&quot; (, &quot;Independent Ukraine&quot;) until July 1905. Tsarist censors, however, closed this magazine, and Petliura moved back to Kyiv.

In Kyiv, Petliura first worked for &quot;Rada&quot;. In 1907 he became editor of the literary magazine &quot;Slovo&quot;. Also, he co-edited the magazine &quot;Ukrayina&quot;.

In 1909, these publications were closed by Russian imperial police, and Petliura moved back to Moscow to publish. There, he was co-editor of the Russian-language journal &quot;Ukrayinskaya Zhizn&quot; to familiarize the local population with news and culture of what was known as Malorossia. He was the chief editor of this publication from 1912 to 1914. In Moscow, he married his wife Olha Bilska in 1915 (later she was also known as her husband under the surname of Marchenko). There, in Moscow was born the daughter of Petliura, Lesia (Olesia).

In Paris, Petliura continued the struggle for Ukrainian independence as a publicist. In 1924, Petliura became the editor and publisher of the weekly journal (&quot;Trident&quot;). He contributed to this journal using various pen names, including V. Marchenko, and V. Salevsky.

==Revolution in Ukraine==
===Rise to power===
In May 1917 Petliura attended the First All-Ukrainian Congress of Soldier Deputies held in Kyiv as a delegate. On 18 May he was elected head of the Ukrainian General Military Committee, today seen as the ultimate progenitor of the modern Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. With the proclamation of the Central Council of Ukraine on 28 June 1917, Petliura became the first Secretary (Minister) for Military Affairs.

Disagreeing with the politics of the then chairman of the General Secretariat Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Petliura left the government and became the head of the , a military formation of Sloboda Ukraine (in Kharkiv). In January–February 1918 the Haidamaka Kish was forced back to protect Kyiv during the Uprising at the Kyiv Arsenal Plant and to prevent the capture of the capital by the Bolshevik Red Guard.

After the April 1918 Ukrainian coup d&#x27;état, Pavlo Skoropadskyi&#x27;s government arrested Petliura and incarcerated him for four months in Bila Tserkva.

Petliura participated in the Anti-Hetman Uprising of November 1918 and became a member of the Directorate of Ukraine as the Chief of Military Forces. Following the fall of Kyiv (February 1919) and the emigration of Vynnychenko from Ukraine, Petliura became the leader of the Directorate on 11 February 1919. In his capacity as head of the Army and State, he continued to fight both Bolshevik and White forces in Ukraine for the next ten months.

===1919===

With the outbreak of hostilities between Ukraine and Soviet Russia in January 1919, and with Vynnychenko&#x27;s emigration, Petliura ultimately became the leading figure in the Directorate. During the winter of 1919 the Petliura army lost most of Ukraine (including Kyiv) to Bolsheviks and by March 6 relocated to Podolia. In the spring of 1919 he managed to extinguish a coup-d&#x27;etat led by Volodymyr Oskilko who saw Petliura cooperating with socialists such as Borys Martos. During the course of the year, Petliura continued to defend the fledgling republic against incursions by the Bolsheviks, Anton Denikin&#x27;s White Russians, and the Romanian-Polish troops. By autumn of 1919, most of Denikin&#x27;s White Russian forces were defeated — in the meantime, however, the Bolsheviks had grown to become the dominant force in Ukraine.


===1920===
On 5 December 1919, Petliura withdrew to Poland, which had previously recognized him as the head of the legal government of Ukraine. In April 1920, as head of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, he signed an alliance in Warsaw with the Polish government, agreeing to a border on the River Zbruch and recognizing Poland&#x27;s right to Galicia in exchange for military aid in overthrowing the Bolshevik régime. Polish forces, reinforced by Petliura&#x27;s remaining troops (some two divisions), attacked Kyiv on 7 May 1920, in what proved a turning point of the 1919–21 Polish-Bolshevik war. Following initial successes, Piłsudski&#x27;s and Petliura&#x27;s forces had to retreat to the Vistula River and to the Polish capital, Warsaw. The Polish Army defeated the Bolshevik Russians in the end, but the Red Army remained in parts of Ukraine and therefore Ukrainians were unable to secure their independence. Petliura directed the affairs of the Ukrainian government-in-exile from Tarnów in Lesser Poland, and when the Soviet government in Moscow requested Petliura&#x27;s extradition from Poland, the Poles engineered his &quot;disappearance&quot;, secretly moving him from Tarnów to Warsaw.

===After the revolution===
Bolshevik Russia persistently demanded that Petliura be handed over. Protected by several Polish friends and colleagues, such as Henryk Józewski, with the establishment of the Soviet Union on 30 December 1922, Petliura, in late 1923 left Poland for Budapest, then Vienna, Geneva and finally settled in Paris in early 1924. Here he established and edited the Ukrainian-language newspaper &quot;Tryzub&quot;.

==Promoting a Ukrainian cultural identity==
During his time as leader of the Directorate, Petliura was active in supporting Ukrainian culture both in Ukraine and in the Ukrainian diaspora.

===Supporting culture in Ukraine===
Petliura introduced the awarding of the title &quot;People&#x27;s Artist of Ukraine&quot; to artists who had made significant contributions to Ukrainian culture. A similar titled award was continued after a significant break under the Soviet regime. Among those who had received this award was blind kobza player Ivan Kuchuhura-Kucherenko.

===Promoting Ukrainian culture abroad===
He also saw the value in gaining international support and recognition of Ukrainian arts through cultural exchanges. Most notably, Petliura actively supported the work of cultural leaders such as the choreographer Vasyl Avramenko, conductor Oleksander Koshetz and bandurist Vasyl Yemetz, to allow them to travel internationally and promote an awareness of Ukrainian culture. Koshetz created the Ukrainian Republic Capella and took it on tour internationally, giving concerts in Europe and the Americas. One of the concerts by the Capella inspired George Gershwin to write &quot;Summertime&quot;, based on the lullaby &quot;Oi Khodyt Son Kolo Vikon&quot; All three musicians later emigrated to the United States.

==Life in exile==
In Paris, Petliura directed the activities of the government of the Ukrainian National Republic in exile. He launched the weekly &quot;Tryzub&quot;, and continued to edit and write numerous articles under various pen names with an emphasis on questions dealing with national oppression in Ukraine. These articles were written with a literary flair. The question of national awareness was often of significance in his literary work.

Petliura&#x27;s articles had a significant impact on the shaping of Ukrainian national awareness in the early 20th century. He published articles and brochures under a variety of noms de plume, including V. Marchenko, V. Salevsky, I. Rokytsky, and O. Riastr.

==Role in pogroms==

Petliura is considered a controversial figure connected with the pogroms of Jews during his rule of the Ukrainian National Republic. According to Peter Kenez, &quot;before the advent of Hitler, the greatest mass murder of Jews occurs in Ukraine in the course of the Civil War. All participants in the conflict were guilty of murdering Jews, even the Bolsheviks; however the Volunteer Army had the largest number of victims.&quot; The number of Jews killed during the period is estimated to be between 50,000 and 200,000. A total of 1,236 violent attacks on Jews had been recorded between 1918 and 1921 in Ukraine. Among them, 493 were carried out by Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic soldiers under the command of Symon Petliura, 307 by independent Ukrainian warlords, 213 by Denikin&#x27;s army, 106 by the Red Army, and 32 by the Polish Army.

The newly formed Ukrainian state (Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic) promised Jews full equality and autonomy. Arnold Margolin, a Jewish assistant minister in Petliura&#x27;s UPR government, declared in May 1919 that the Ukrainian government had given Jews more rights than they enjoyed in any other European government. However, after 1918, military units became involved in pogroms against Jews. During Petliura&#x27;s term as Head of State (1919–20), pogroms continued to be perpetrated on Ukrainian territory.

Petliura&#x27;s role in the pogroms has been a topic of dispute since his assassination in 1926 and the succeeding Schwarzbard&#x27;s trial. In 1969, the journal &quot;Jewish Social Studies&quot; published two opposing views regarding Petliura&#x27;s responsibility in pogroms against Jews during his reign over Ukraine, by scholars Taras Hunczak and Zosa Szajkowski. Later the &quot;Journal&quot; published letters from the two authors.

According to Hunczak, Petliura actively sought to halt anti-Jewish violence on numerous occasions, introducing capital punishment for carrying out pogroms. Conversely, he is also accused of not having done enough to stop the pogroms and being afraid to punish officers and soldiers engaged in crimes against Jews for fear of losing their support.

==Assassination==

On 25 May 1926, at 14:12, by the Gibert bookstore, Petliura was walking on Rue Racine near Boulevard Saint-Michel of the Latin Quarter in Paris and was approached by Sholem Schwarzbard. Schwarzbard asked him in Ukrainian, &quot;Are you Mr. Petliura?&quot; Petliura did not answer but raised his walking cane. Schwarzbard pulled out a gun, proclaimed &quot;dirty dog, killer of my people, defend yourself!&quot; and shot him five times. Evading a lynch-mob attempting to avenge Petliura, Schwarzbard gave himself into the police with a note reading: &quot;I have killed Petliura to avenge the death of the thousands of pogrom victims in Ukraine who were massacred by Petliura&#x27;s forces without his taking any steps to prevent these massacres.&quot; The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported on 27 May 1926 that Petliura&#x27;s &quot;pogrom bands&quot; were responsible for killing tens of thousands of Jews.

Schwarzbard was an anarchist of Jewish descent, born in Ukraine. He participated in the Jewish self-defense of Balta in 1905. The Russian Tsarist government sentenced him to 3 months in prison for &quot;provoking&quot; the Balta pogrom. He was twice convicted of taking part in anarchist &quot;expropriation&quot; (burglary) and bank robbery in Austria-Hungary. He later joined the French Foreign Legion (1914–1917) and was wounded in the Battle of the Somme. It is reported that Schwarzbard told famous fellow anarchist leader Nestor Makhno in Paris that he was terminally ill and expected to die and that he would take Petliura with him; Makhno forbade Schwarzbard to do so.

Schwarzbard&#x27;s parents were among fifteen members of his family murdered in the pogroms in Odesa. The core defense at the Schwarzbard trial was — as presented by the noted jurist Henri Torres — that he was avenging the deaths of more than 50,000 Jewish victims of the pogroms, whereas the prosecution (both criminal and civil) tried to show that Petliura was not responsible for the pogroms and that Schwarzbard was a Soviet agent. After a trial lasting eight days the jury acquitted Schwarzbard.

According to a defected KGB operative Peter Deriabin, Schwarzbard was a Soviet (NKVD) agent and acted on the order from a former chairman of the Soviet Ukrainian government and current Soviet Ambassador to France, Christian Rakovsky. The special operation of the GPU was consolidated by GPU agent Mikhail Volodin, who arrived in France 8 August 1925, and who had been in close contact with Schwarzbard.

It is claimed that in March 1926, Vlas Chubar (Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of Ukraine), in a speech given in Kharkiv and repeated in Moscow, warned of the danger Petliura represented to Soviet power. It was after this speech that the command had allegedly been given to assassinate Petliura.
Petliura was buried alongside his wife and daughter in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.

Petliura&#x27;s two sisters, Orthodox nuns who had remained in Poltava, were arrested and shot in 1928 by the NKVD.[]
==Legacy==
===Ukraine===
With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, previously restricted Soviet archives have allowed numerous politicians and historians to review Petliura&#x27;s role in Ukrainian history. Some consider him a national hero who strove for the independence of Ukraine. Several cities, including Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and Poltava, the city of his birth, have erected monuments to Petliura, with a museum complex also being planned in Poltava. Petliura&#x27;s statue, unveiled in Vinnytsia in October 2017, was denounced as disgraceful and deplorable by the World Jewish Congress. To mark the 80th anniversary of his assassination, a twelve-volume edition of his writings, including articles, letters and historic documents, has been published in Kyiv by Taras Shevchenko University and the State Archive of Ukraine. In 1992 in Poltava, a series of readings known as &quot;Petliurivski chytannia&quot; have become an annual event, and since 1993, they have taken place annually at Kyiv University.

In June 2009, Kyiv City Council renamed Comintern Street (located in Shevchenkivskyi District) as to commemorate the 130th anniversary of his birth.

In modern-day Ukraine, Petliura has not been as lionized as Mykhailo Hrushevsky (who played a much smaller role in the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic), since Petliura was too closely associated with violence to make a good symbolic figure. In a 2008 poll of &quot;Famous Ukrainians of all times&quot; (in which respondents did not receive any lists or tips), Petliura was not mentioned (Hrushevsky came in sixth place in this poll). In the 2008 TV project &quot;Velyki Ukraïntsi&quot; (&quot;Greatest Ukrainians&quot;), he placed 26th.

A nephew of Symon Petliura, Stepan Skrypnyk, became Patriarch Mstyslav of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church on 6 June 1990.

In December 2022, the city of Izium – recently liberated from Russian forces – decided to rename Maxim Gorky Street as Symon Petliura Street.

===Ukrainian diaspora===
For part of the Western Ukrainian diaspora, Petliura is remembered as a national hero, a fighter for Ukrainian independence, a martyr, who inspired hundreds of thousands to fight for an independent Ukrainian state. He has inspired original music, and youth organizations.

===Petliura in Ukrainian folk songs===
During the revolution Petliura became the subject of numerous folk songs, primarily as a hero calling for his people to unite against foreign oppression. His name became synonymous with the call for freedom. 15 songs were recorded by the ethnographer rev. prof. K. Danylevsky. In the songs Petliura is depicted as a soldier, in a manner similar to Robin Hood, mocking Skoropadsky and the Bolshevik Red Guard.

News of Petliura&#x27;s assassination in the summer of 1926 was marked by numerous revolts in eastern Ukraine particularly in Boromlia, Zhehailivtsi, (Sumy province), Velyka Rublivka, Myloradov (Poltava province), Hnylsk, Bilsk, Kuzemyn and all along the Vorskla River from Okhtyrka to Poltava, Burynia, Nizhyn (Chernihiv province) and other cities. These revolts were brutally pacified by the Soviet administration. The blind kobzars Pavlo Hashchenko and Ivan Kuchuhura Kucherenko composed a &quot;duma&quot; (epic poem) in memory of Symon Petliura. To date Petliura is the only modern Ukrainian politician to have a duma created and sung in his memory. This duma became popular among the kobzars of left-bank Ukraine and was sung also by Stepan Pasiuha, Petro Drevchenko, Bohushchenko, and Chumak.

The Soviets also tried their hand at portraying Petliura through the arts in order to discredit the Ukrainian national leader. A number of humorous songs appeared in which Petliura is portrayed as a traveling beggar whose only territory is that which is under his train carriage. A number of plays such as &quot;The Republic on Wheels&quot; by Yakov Mamontov and the opera &quot;Shchors&quot; by Boris Liatoshinsky and &quot;Arsenal&quot; by Heorhiy Maiboroda portray Petliura in a negative light, as a lackey who sold out Western Ukraine to Poland, often using the very same melodies which had become popular during the fight for Ukrainian Independence in 1918.

Petliura continues to be portrayed by the Ukrainian people in its folk songs in a manner similar to Taras Shevchenko and Bohdan Khmelnytsky. He is likened to the sun which suddenly stopped shining.

<text>Shandong University (; SDU) is a public university in Jinan, Shandong, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

The oldest of Shandong University&#x27;s precursor institutions, Cheeloo University, was founded by American and English mission agencies in the late 19th century (as Tengchow College of Liberal Arts in Penglai). Tengchow College was the first modern institution of higher learning in China. Shandong University derives its official founding date from the Imperial Shandong University established in Jinan in November 1901 as the second modern national university in the country.

Shandong University has eight campuses, all but two of which are located in the provincial capital city of Jinan. The newest of these campuses is located to the northeast of the port city of Qingdao.

==History==
=== Traditional Learning in Shandong (1733-1901) ===


The Luoyuan Academy () was established in
Jinan in 1733 by an imperial edict from the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. The governor of Shandong, Yue Jun (), received 1,000 taels of silver (approximately 37 kg) to fund the establishment of the academy. The name &quot;Luoyuan&quot; (literally &quot;source of the Luo [River]&quot;) refers to the original location of the academy near the Baotu Spring. The academy was dedicated to teaching the Chinese classics to the sons of the gentry. Scholars affiliated with the academy include: Bi Yuan (畢沅, 1730–1797), Sang Tiaoyuan (桑调元, 1695–1771), Shen Qiyuan (沈起元, 1685–1763), He Shaoji (何紹基, 1799–1873), Kuang Yuan (匡源, 1815–1881), Wang Zhihan (王之翰, 1821–1850), Liu Yaochun (), Zhu Xuedu (朱学笃, 1826–1892), and Miao Quansun (缪荃孙, 1844–1919). In 1881, the American Presbyterian missionaries John Murray () and Stephen A. Hunter () attempted to purchase a property adjacent to the Luoyuan Academy for use as a chapel. This led to a violent reaction when on July 13, 1881, literati from the academy incited an attack on the property. The incident, known as the &quot;Jinan Missionary Incident&quot; (), had considerable diplomatic repercussions for the relationship between the Qing Dynasty and the United States. The Luoyuan Academy was rebuilt in 1896 to become the largest institution of its kind in Shandong. Five years later (in 1901) it was replaced by the newly founded Imperial Shandong College which took over its campus (today the site of the Provincial Bureau of Statistics on Spring City Road ()).

===19th-Century Precursors===
The earliest precursor institutions that would later be fused into Shandong University were founded by American and English mission agencies: In early January 1864, Calvin W. Mateer, an American Presbyterian missionary, and his wife Julia Brown Mateer, arrived in the recently opened treaty port of Dengzhou (, now Zhifu, Yantai) in the area of the present-day city of Penglai on the north-eastern coast of Shandong Peninsula. Their journey had begun in New York on July 3, 1863, had taken them around the Cape of Good Hope to Shanghai, and had ended with a shipwreck off the coast of Yantai. In the autumn of 1864, the Mateers opened an elementary school for boys, which was called Mengyang Educational Society (), in a Guanyin temple that had been sold to them since there were insufficient funds for its upkeep as a temple. The school&#x27;s first class consisted of six boarders and two day pupils. The school was enlarged to accommodate 30 boarders and divided into primary and high school sections in 1869. The high school became known as the Wenhui Guan (). The Tengchow College of Liberal Arts was formally established in 1882, i.e., at a time when the school had been operated as a primary and high school for 18 years already. By 1889, enrollment in the college had grown to 100 students. The six-year curriculum included algebra, geometry and conic sections, trigonometry and measurement, surveying and navigation, analytical geometry and mathematical physics, calculus, as well as astronomy. Religion also featured prominently in the curriculum as well as in daily life at Tengchow College. The college soon enjoyed a reputation for its high standards of academic excellence. When W.A.P Martin hired young professors of Western learning for the Imperial University of Peking (the precursor of present-day Peking University), 12 out of 13 young professors hired were graduates of Tengchow College of Liberal Arts. In 1884, shortly after the formal establishment of Tengchow College of Liberal Arts, British Baptists established Tsingchow Boys&#x27; Boarding School in Qingzhou, also located in northern Shandong, but not directly on the coast.

In 1902, the American and British missionaries agreed to combine their education ventures in Shandong, and established an arts college () in Weifang, a theological college () in Qingzhou, and a medical college () in Jinan. In 1909, all three colleges were consolidated into Shantung Protestant University () which was later renamed Shantung Christian University (). &quot;Cheeloo University&quot;, the school&#x27;s informal name that had been officially approved by the school council in 1915, was derived from &quot;Qilu&quot;, a nickname of Shandong Province coined after the ancient states of Qi (1046 BC–221 BC) and Lu (10th century BC–256 BC) that once existed in the area. Jinan was chosen as the new location for the consolidated university.
A prominent member of Cheeloo University&#x27;s faculty was Henry Winters Luce (1868–1941), the father of the publisher Henry R. Luce (founder of &quot;TIME,&quot; &quot;Fortune&quot;, and &quot;Life&quot;). Henry W. Luce initially led the fundraising efforts for the new campus in Jinan (today the Baotuquan Campus of Shandong University). In this capacity, he raised 300,000 dollars between 1912 and 1915 from donors in the United States. The buildings on the new Cheeloo campus were designed by the architectural firm of Perkins, Fellows, &amp; Hamilton from Chicago. Henry W. Luce was elected vice-president of Cheeloo University in 1916, but resigned in the following year already, because he felt that he had insufficient support for his vision of a university of major national influence from the then Cheeloo president J. Percy Bruce.
Cheeloo University particularly made its mark in the field of medicine: From 1914 to 1936, the university built and subsequently expanded Cheeloo Hospital as a major facility for medical education in China. Between 1916 and 1923, the former Peking Union Medical College, the Medical Department of Nanking University, the Hankow Medical College, and the North China Union Medical College for Women were all moved to Jinan and merged into the Cheeloo University School of Medicine under Dean and acting university president Samuel Cochran.
Cheeloo University attracted Chinese intellectuals and scholars. The writer Lao She, author of the novel &quot;Rickshaw Boy&quot; and the play &quot;Teahouse&quot;, taught at Cheeloo University (1930–1934) as well as at National Shandong University in Qingdao and other universities between 1934 and 1937. 
In 1937, when the Japanese forces occupied northern China during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Cheeloo University evacuated to Sichuan and operated on the campus of West China Union University in Chengdu. In Jinan, the university&#x27;s hospital remained open with a largely Western staff. During the war, the Japanese military used the entire campus for housing about 1,200 patients along with 600 officers. 
During the Korean War (1950–1953), the Chinese government came to regard Christian schools as tools of &quot;American imperialism&quot; and hence embarked on closing them down. Cheeloo University was dissolved in 1952. Its Medical School was fused with Shandong Provincial Medical College and the East China Norman Bethune Medical College to form Shandong Medical College (renamed into &quot;Shandong Medical University&quot; in 1985).

=== Formal Establishment===
The initiative for the founding of Shandong University (as Imperial Shandong University, ) in 1901 as a national, modern university came from Yuan Shikai, then the governor of Shandong province. Yuan Shikai was the chief military modernizer of the late Qing Dynasty whose control over a powerful army combined with his personal ambition played a key role in the birth of the Republic of China as well as its descent into warlordism in the early 20th century.

Yuan Shikai had been governor of Shandong Province since December 1899. He had been appointed to this post to quell the Boxer Uprising in the province and to reassure the foreign diplomats in the country who were looking for quick decisive actions against the boxers. In 1901, the same year that marked the end of the Boxer Uprising, Yuan sent a draft for the university charter () to the Guangxu Emperor and instructed Li Yukai, the magistrate of Penglai, to start preparations for the university. The draft of the university charter was approved by the emperor in November 1901, shortly after the Boxer Uprising had officially ended with the signing of the Boxer Protocol on September 7, 1901. Shandong Imperial University became hence the second modern national university established in the country after Imperial Capital University () that had been founded in 1898 and later became Peking University. The charter of Shandong Imperial University served as a model for subsequent foundations of imperial university. The original charter document for Shandong University is now kept in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan where it had been taken during the retreat of the Kuomintang at the end of the Chinese Civil War.
Governor Yuan Shikai wanted a prominent position for Western learning in the curriculum of the new college. Hence, he invited the American Presbyterian missionary Dr. Watson McMillan Hayes (, 1857–1944) who was then serving as president of Tengchow College in Penglai to help with setting up the new Imperial Shandong University and serve as its president. The appointment of the Presbyterian missionary W. A. P. Martin as inaugural president of the Imperial Capital University three years earlier had set a precedent for this arrangement. Hayes arrived in Jinan in July 1901 and started the preparations for the new college. Hayes also published Shandong&#x27;s first successful daily newspaper and petitioned the Qing court to grant a holiday on Sundays; As a consequence, Shandong University was closed on Sundays right from the start. However, by the end of the year, Hayes and six Chinese Christian teachers he had brought with him had resigned already over disagreements regarding the policy of mandatory Confucius worship for students of the imperial university. Hayes went on to teach the Presbyterian Mission Theological Class in Chefoo (present-day Yantai) and continued to work as a missionary and educator in Shandong until his death in a Japanese internment camp in Wei County (present-day Weifang) in 1944.

Imperial Shandong University occupied the premises of the Luoyuan Academy which had been renovated and extended significantly five years earlier. It was opened on November 13, 1901, in a ceremony attended by Governor Yuan Shikai. 299 student were enrolled in the first term, of which 120 passed the first examination and 100 were finally admitted. The first faculty had 50 members that also included teachers from overseas, it was later increased to 110. The curriculum contained Chinese classics, Chinese history, social sciences, natural sciences, and foreign language with more than 20 subjects being taught. At the beginning, the curriculum covered 3 years, but it was later expanded to 4 years.

The first president of the new university was Zhou Xuexi. 
In 1904, Imperial Shandong University moved to new premises in the Ganshi Qiao () area of Jinan (located to the south-west of the historical city center) and changed its name to &quot;Shandong Institution of Higher Learning&quot; (). In 1911, it changed its name once again, this time to the &quot;School of Higher Learning&quot; ().

The first modern academic institution in the port city of Qingdao, then part of the German Kiautschou Bay colonial concession, was the German-Chinese &quot;Advanced School of Special Sciences of a Special Type&quot; (&quot;Hochschule für Spezialwissenschaften mit besonderem Charakter&quot;, ). It was founded on October 25, 1909, about 11 years after the German lease on the territory went into effect. In establishing the university, the German authorities took a much more accommodating approach towards the Chinese government than they had taken in the de facto annexation of the territory. The negotiations over the establishment of the school were led by sinologist Otto Franke. Although the German governor Oskar von Truppel vigorously objected to Chinese influence over the school, Franke&#x27;s collaboration plan received firm backing from Admiral von Tirpitz as well as the German envoy in Beijing. The university operated under the supervision of the German naval administration, but was recognized and supported financially by the Chinese government. The cumbersome name of the school (&quot;spezial&quot; or &quot;tebie&quot;, i.e., &quot;special&quot;) was chosen at the insistence of the Chinese government to reflect its special status, below the Imperial College in Beijing but above the other provincial Chinese universities. The local informal name for the university was &quot;Hainan School&quot; in reference to an old name for Qingdao. Studies were organized in a &quot;preparatory level&quot; with a six-year (since 1911, five-year) curriculum for students aged 13 to 15 years and an &quot;upper school&quot;. Subjects covered included German, history, geography, mathematics, natural history, zoology, botany, health, physics, chemistry, drawing, music, sports, as well as Chinese language and sciences. Whereas engineering and natural sciences were taught in an entirely &quot;Western mode&quot;, the Chinese and European approaches were combined in the teaching of the humanities. Religious subjects had been excluded from the curriculum at the request of the Chinese government. The number of students at the school rose to about 400 in 1914, the school assembled a German and a Chinese library with about 5000 and 8000 volumes respectively. School operations ceased with the beginning of the First World War in 1914 and never resumed.

Qingdao reverted from Japanese to Chinese control in 1922 and Qingdao University was founded as a new private university in August 1924; its first president was Gao Enhong, the governor of Qingdao (former Jiaozhou territory). The former German-Chinese university was not mentioned during the opening ceremony and it was decided not to hire foreign teachers for the time being.

Qingdao University was housed in the former Bismarck barracks that had been constructed for the German troops in 1903, i.e., during the time when Qingdao was part of the German concession in Shandong. The curriculum of Qingdao University was mainly focused on engineering and business administration and a bachelor&#x27;s degree was to be awarded after four years of study. Luo Ronghuan, later a marshal of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, was among Qingdao University&#x27;s students. Qingdao University fell on hard times after the Zhili clique of warlords that had ruled Shandong since the takeover from the Japanese unexpectedly lost to its rival Fengtian clique in the Second Zhili–Fengtian War of 1924. Gao Enhong was forced to resign as president of the university and funding dried up.
The Fengtian clique installed the warlord Zhang Zongchang as ruler of Shandong. Zhang, an illiterate former bandit who had built a reputation mainly for ruthlessness, brutality, and colorful antics, ordered the fusion of six schools into a provincial Shandong University () in Jinan in 1926.

In 1928, the Kuomintang Government in Nanjing regained control of northern China and Shandong through the Northern Expedition. Soon afterwards, preparations commenced for a National University in the province. In August 1928, the government ordered the replacement of the provincial Shandong University with a National University in Shandong. The National University of Qingdao was formally established with an opening ceremony on September 21, 1930. In 1932, it was renamed &quot;National Shandong University&quot;. Like Qingdao University, Shandong National University was housed in the buildings of the former Bismarck barracks. The university&#x27;s chancellor, Yang Zhensheng (), followed the model set by Peking University in establishing an &quot;inclusive&quot; (), &quot;scientific and democratic&quot; () academic environment. During this period, Shandong National University hired distinguished scientists, scholars and literary figures such as Lao She, Wen Yiduo, Shen Congwen, Liang Shiqiu, the nuclear physicist Wang Ganchang (faculty member from 1934 to 1936), and the embryologist Tong Dizhou. Poet Zang Kejia, who later co-edited the &quot;Selected Poems of Chairman Mao&quot; (, 1957), was a student of Wen Yiduo from 1930 to 1934 in Qingdao.

===Wartime (1937-49)===
In November 1937, a few months after Marco Polo Bridge Incident that had marked the outbreak of a fully-fledged war in July of the same year, National Shandong University was evacuated from Qingdao. The university first moved to Anqing in Anhui Province and soon afterwards to Wanxian in Sichuan Province (today Wanzhou District in Chongqing). Books, equipment, and administrative files were shipped in separate installments and suffered severe loss. Classes resumed in Wanxian in Spring 1938, but were stopped soon after that on orders of the Ministry of Education. Teachers and students were then transferred to the National Central University that had been moved from Nanjing to Chongqing in the previous year. The books and equipment of Shandong University were placed into storage in the National Central Library, the National Central University, and the National Central Vocational School. After the war, in the spring of 1946, the university moved back to Qingdao.

From 1945 until May 1949, part of the Shandong University campus in Qingdao served as the headquarters for the U.S. Sixth Marine Division until it was disbanded on March 31, 1946 and later on for the U.S. Fleet Marine Force, Western Pacific. In 1947, the Su Mingcheng Incident, in which an American seaman had killed a rickshaw puller after an argument, caused protests of the university students.

Before the surrender of Japanese, in 1944, the Central China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) decided to establish Huazhong Construction University (华中建设大学) on the basis of the Huazhonga Party School. The school was located in Xinpu, Xuyi County, in the border area of Jiangsu and Anhui. In August 1945, the school moved to Qingjiang City.

In August 1945, the Shandong Anti-Japanese People&#x27;s Government of the CCP established Shandong University in Linyi, the capital of the communist base; to distinguish it from the National Shandong University, it was called Linyi Shandong University. In early 1946, Peng Kang, the president of Huazhong Construction University, led the teachers and students of the university to merge into Linyi Shandong University.

Shortly after Japanese withdrew from China, CCP and KMT fought the Chinese Civil War. In the summer of 1948, the East China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party decided to establish East China University in Weifang by combining the former Linyi Shandong University with Huazhong Construction University. After Jinan was taken by the communists, East China University moved to Jinan in November. In the winter of 1950, after KMT and US Navy left Qingdao, it was ordered to move to Qingdao, and in 1951 it merged with Shandong University in Qingdao.

===Early Time in PRC (1949–65)===
In 1951, East China University () was merged into Shandong University. In the same year, the university published the &quot;Journal of Shandong University&quot;. Cheeloo University was dissolved in 1952 and its Medical School became part of Shandong Medical College. Prior to the Sino-Soviet split, Soviet faculty members worked at Shandong University. In October 1958, the university moved back to Jinan from Qingdao. The marine sciences remained in Qingdao, where they later formed Shandong Ocean University. In Jinan, Shandong University first occupied the Hongjialou Campus. Construction of the new Central Campus commenced in 1959, during the Great Leap Forward and in the year of a great Yellow River flood. Shandong University was added to the list of National Key University on October 10, 1960.

===Cultural Revolution (1966–76)===

Starting from early June 1966, schools in Jinan were closed down by strikes as teachers were &quot;struggled against&quot; in the Cultural Revolution. Shandong University was also completely paralyzed by the events. A complete restructuring was imposed on Shandong&#x27;s university system: according to a resolution passed by the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province on July 29, 1970, the liberal arts of Shandong University were moved to Qufu and combined with Qufu Normal College to form a new Shandong University. The biology department was moved to Tai&#x27;an and merged into the Shandong Agricultural College. The rest of the sciences was to form the Shandong Science and Technology University. In 1971, the university&#x27;s admission policy was also changed: in order to open the university to workers and peasants, new students were now nominated &quot;by the masses&quot; and then approved by the political leadership and the university. Until 1976, a total of 3267 students who were admitted under this scheme graduated after completing a 2- or 3-year curriculum. Premier Zhou Enlai learned of Shandong University&#x27;s reorganization in 1973. Although he was already terminally ill with bladder cancer at the time, he intervened and ordered a return to previous structure of the university. As a consequence, all organizational changes imposed by the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province were undone in early 1974.

===Recent history (1980–present)===
Shandong University Weihai Campus was established in 1984. In 1985, Shandong Medical College was renamed Shandong Medical University. From 1986 to 1996, Shandong University underwent a period of rapid academic expansion. By 1997, is contained 14 colleges, 45 schools and offered 56 undergraduate program, 57 master&#x27;s degree programs as well as 17 doctoral degree programs. Shandong University merged with Shandong Medical University and the Shandong University of Technology in 2000. With Shandong Medical University the former campus of Cheeloo University became part of Shandong University (as the West Campus, renamed Baotuquan Campus in 2009). The campus of Shandong University of Technology became the South Campus of Shandong University (renamed Qianfoshan Campus in 2009). Construction of the Xinglongshan Campus (then under the name &quot;New South Campus&quot;), a large new campus located in a mountain valley to the south of Jinan dedicated to education of first- and second-year undergraduate students, began in 2003.

In July 2019, the university attracted controversy when it was reported that male foreign students were assigned three generally female Chinese &quot;buddies&quot; to help them with life in China. An application form for the study program even mentioned &quot;making foreign friends of the opposite sex&quot;. The university subsequently apologized but dismissed reports of male international students being paired with three female domestic students, saying that the language on the application form was &quot;improper expression&quot; due to &quot;insufficient checks&quot;. The incident led to complaints about foreign students receiving too many privileges.

== Reputation and ranking ==

Shandong University was one of the Project 985 universities in China to appear in the world&#x27;s top 500 universities in the first global university ranking in 2003, according to the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities.&quot; The joint &quot;THE-QS World University Rankings&quot; 2005 ranked Shandong University =282nd in the world.

==Campuses==
Shandong University has a total of seven campuses. All but two of them are located in Jinan, the capital city of Shandong Province. Together they cover an area of 3.8 km2. There are two campuses outside Jinan, one is located in Qingdao, and another is in Weihai.

===Central Campus===

Construction of the Central Campus commenced in 1959, about a year after the university had moved back from Qingdao to Jinan and during a time that coincided with the Great Leap Forward, the Great Chinese Famine, as well as a devastating flood of the Yellow River (in July 1959). The Central Campus houses the central administration (in the Mingde Building, ), the main university library, a large dining hall, as well as student dormitories. The central campus is home to the schools of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Economics, History and Culture, Marxism–Leninism, Life Sciences, Mathematics and System Science, Literature and Journalism and Communication, as well as Information Science and Engineering. One of Shandong University&#x27;s hotels (, or for short: &quot;Xueren Dasha&quot;, ) is also located on the central campus. The roads within the Central Campus are named after concepts from Confucianism.

===Hongjialou Campus===

The Hongjialou Campus derives its name from the Hongjialou Square and is located immediately to the north and east of the Square and the Sacred Heart Cathedral (). The first construction on the campus dates back to 1936 when it was used for the Jinan Yifan Girls&#x27; Middle School () that was operated by Franciscan sisters () of the Archdiocese of Jinan. In 1948, the Yifan Girls&#x27; Middle School was combined with Liming Middle School () and its former campus became part of the Shandong Agricultural Institute that used it until 1958, when the Institute moved to Tai&#x27;an. In October 1958, the Hongjialou Campus became Shandong University&#x27;s first Campus after the university moved back to Jinan from Qingdao. The Hongjialou Campus houses the Schools of Law, Foreign Languages and Literature as well as Fine Arts.

===Baotuquan Campus===

The Baotuquan Campus is the former campus of Cheeloo University and was established in 1909. The design for the campus was made by Perkins, Fellows and Hamilton, an architectural firm from Chicago renowned for its school buildings in the &quot;Prairie School&quot; style. The American architects attempted to include Chinese architectural features into the design of the buildings on the new Cheeloo University campus in Jinan. They did, however, mistakenly assume that the roof shape was the only distinguishing feature of Chinese architecture. As a result, the buildings feature Chinese-style roofs on buildings that lack the matching support elements such as wooden Dougong brackets that characterize Chinese architecture. Historical buildings on the Baotuquan Campus include the Bergen Science Hall (, formerly for Chemistry and Biology), the Mateer Science Hall (formerly for Physics and Physiology), the McCormick Hall, and the Alumni Gate (the former main entrance, construction completed on June 17, 1924). Baotuquan Campus houses the schools of public health, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, and medicine.

===Qianfoshan Campus===

The Qianfoshan Campus was established in 1949 and served as the campus of Shandong University of Technology. It became a part of Shandong University when Shandong University of Technology was merged into Shandong University in July 2000. The campus has a total area of about 420,000 square meters and remains exclusively dedicated to engineering. It is home to the schools of Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Technology, Control Science and Engineering, Energy and Power Engineering, Physical Education, as well as Civil Engineering. The roads on the Qianfoshan Campus are named after famous engineers and inventors from China as well as abroad.

===Xinglongshan Campus===

The Xinglongshan Campus is the newest campus of Shandong University and also its largest campus in Jinan with an area of about 769,000 square meters. Construction of the campus started in March 2003 and its first facilities were ready for use in August 2004. The campus is used to house first- and second-year students of nine different departments. The Xinglongshan Campus also houses a Student Associations Activity Center with a total floor space of about 2000 square meters.

===Qilu Software College Campus===

The Qilu Software College Campus is home to the School of Computer Science and Technology as well as to
the university&#x27;s Software College. Campus construction started in July 2001 and the campus now has a total area of about 267,000 square meters. More than 3,000 students live on the Qilu Software College Campus. The campus is located next to a cluster of commercial software ventures, such as the China International ICT Innovation Cluster (CIIIC) and shares educational resources with these businesses.

===Weihai Campus===

Shandong University Weihai Campus was established in 1984, its campus covers a total area of about 1 million square meters, making it the largest campus of Shandong University. Shandong University Weihai Campus is organized in 13 departments that include the College of Korean Studies, the Business School, the Law School, the School of Journalism and Communication, the Art Institute, the College of Ocean Science, the School of Information Engineering, the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, the Institute of Space Science and Physics, the Mathematics and Statistics Institute, the School of International Education, and the College of Vocational and Technical Training. To the west of the Weihai campus lies the Shandong University Academic Center, a beach-front hotel and conference center.

===Qingdao Campus===

Construction of the Qingdao Campus started in March 2011 and the first development phase was inaugurated in September 2016. The campus is located north of Xingshi Zhuang Village () in Aoshanwei Town () that is part of Jimo City and located to the northeast of Qingdao. The campus site is immediately adjacent to the seashore of Aoshan Bay and the coastal highway (). The total planning area covers about two million square meters, 43 percent of which are included in the first construction phase. When completed, the Qingdao Campus will have a capacity of 30,000 students; recruitment of the first class of 5,000 freshman students is planned for the fall of 2013. The construction cost is estimated at 800 million Chinese Yuan (about 124 million US Dollars). The architecture of the new campus is intended to blend Chinese and western elements. Many buildings will incorporate the red roofs and other building style elements of the German colonial architecture in Qingdao. The master plan for the campus was developed by Perkins Eastman (New York). One of the founders of Perkins Eastman, Bradford Perkins is the grandson of Dwight H. Perkins, whose firm (Perkins, Fellows, &amp; Hamilton) designed the Cheeloo University campus in Jinan. The campus will be dedicated to advanced science and engineering research, with a special emphasis on interfacing with high-tech industry and international academic collaboration. It is part of a plan to give Shandong University a presence that is distributed throughout the province in a manner that is comparable to the University of California system, but retains a greater level of central control.

==International Cooperation==

Shandong University has established an international network for educational cooperation and has signed exchange agreements with over 70 universities from over 50 countries. Shandong also is associated in a sister school for American Middle Schools and Junior Highs, including Scofield Magnet Middle School. Among its faculty are international researchers and scholars, who either visit for a short term (less than 1 month, 160 visitors in 2009), a medium term (less than half a year, 70 visitors in 2009), or for the long term (more than half a year, 80 visitors in 2009). Of the 80 long-term international faculty members, 30 language scholars teach languages such as English, Japanese, Korean, French, German, Spanish, and Russian. The others are active in disciplines such as philosophy, biology, chemistry, physics, law, international politics and economics, as well as Chinese classics and traditional philosophy.

About 1500 international students from about 40 countries come to study at Shandong University each year. An international student population numbering more than 1000 can be found on campus at any given time during the semester. Most of these international students come from Asian and African countries, but there are also students from Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia. Since 1980, Shandong University has received more than 10,000 students from over 60 countries. Popular study subjects are Chinese language and culture, but also economics and medicine. Furthermore, Shandong University participates in international short term exchange programs and receives approximately 2500 international student visitors for such programs per year.

In 2006, Shandong University created a joint urban research center with the University of Cincinnati in the United States, and a presence on each other&#x27;s campus. An International Laboratory operated in the a partnership with Virginia Tech was inaugurated in the Integrated Research Building on the Central Campus in August 2010. The laboratory focuses on a biophysics and engineering analysis of biological model systems drawn from China&#x27;s biodiversity. Shandong University is a partner university of the Study China Programme, which is coordinated by the University of Manchester and funded by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

==University hospitals==

===Shandong University Qilu Hospital ===
Qilu Hospital was established as the hospital of Cheeloo University. Construction started in 1914 and was supervised by Harold Balme (1878–1953), a British physician from King&#x27;s College Hospital in London, who would later serve as the third president of Cheeloo University (from 1921 until 1927). The first building of the new hospital (today known as the &quot;Republican Building&quot;) was inaugurated on September 27, 1915, by the military governor of Shandong, Jin Yunpeng. About 20 years later, the hospital moved to a new building (completed in 1936) and the old building was used by Cheeloo University&#x27;s School of Medicine. Today, the Shandong University Qilu Hospital as a total capacity of 1,800 beds and treats more than 1.9 million outpatient treatments per year. It has departments include cardiology, internal medicine, hematology, gynecology and obstetrics, otolaryngology, general surgery, neurosurgery, and pediatrics. The hospital is located at Wenhua West Road 107 in Jinan.

===Second Hospital of Shandong University===
The Second Hospital of Shandong University has a capacity of about 2431 beds and has departments for neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, and internal medicine. The hospital is managed by the National Medical Department and affiliated with Shandong University, it is located at Beiyuan Street 247 in Jinan.

===Stomatology Hospital of Shandong University===
The Stomatology Hospital of Shandong University was founded in 1977. It has 105 employees and is organized into four research centers and two laboratories. It is located at Wenhua West Road 44 in Jinan.

==Identity==
===Motto and Slogan===
The official university motto is &quot;Noble in Spirit, Boundless in Knowledge&quot; (); it was adopted in The university also uses the branding slogan &quot;Soul of the mountains, spirit of the sea&quot; () in reference to Shandong&#x27;s geographical nature as a mountainous peninsula. At the main entrance gate (south gate) to the university&#x27;s Central Campus, an inscription defines the mission of the university as &quot;Preparing talents for the world; Striving for the prosperity and strength of the country&quot; (). The official lettering is a reproduction of calligraphy written by Mao Zedong. In March 1964, during the period between the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, Mao wrote the characters in the address of a thank-you note to Gao Heng, a professor at Shandong University who had sent him literature.

===Anthem===
The official anthem of Shandong University () was written by lyricist Cheng Fangwu (), modified by a group of people, and composer Zheng Lvcheng (). The lyrics of the official anthem are:

The song of Shandong University () was written by lyricist Qiao Yu (), who also wrote the lyrics for My Motherland, and composer Gu Jianfen (), both natives of Shandong Province. The lyrics of the anthem are:
=== Logo ===

The core of the pattern is based on the Chinese characters &quot;山&quot; (meaning Mountain, and also the abbreviation of Shandong) and &quot;大&quot; (meaning University) as the basic design elements, and is transformed using modern deformation techniques, making it easy to identify. The logo is simple and bright, easy to produce and disseminate. The school emblem combines straight and curved lines, and is both rigid and flexible, stable and dynamic. It is upward-developing, full of vitality and vigor, full of modernity and rhythm, and has a strong visual impact and rich imagination.

The entire pattern is symmetrical, stable, and balanced, full of the style of a great university and a famous school. The &quot;山&quot; character at the top of the pattern is a deformation of the Chinese pictographic character &quot;山&quot;, which is full of Chinese cultural characteristics. The deformation of the &quot;山&quot; character has an upward trend, implying that Shandong University is constantly developing and striving to create a world-class university. The bottom is a deformation of the &quot;大&quot; character, which looks like a vast ocean, implying that the sea of knowledge is endless. The integration of &quot;山&quot; and &quot;海&quot; easily reminds people of &quot;there is a path to the mountain of books, and diligence is the path; there is no end to the sea of knowledge, and hard work is the boat&quot; (), which shows the spirit of Shandong University teachers and students who are diligent in seeking knowledge and bravely climbing the peak of science. At the same time, it emphasizes the university culture of &quot;soul of the mountains, spirit of the sea&quot; ().

<doc id="395984" wikidata="Q1813941" url="?curid=395984" title="Portobello Road">
<text> is a street in the Notting Hill district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in  West London. It runs almost the length of Notting Hill from South to North, roughly parallel with Ladbroke Grove. On Saturdays it is home to Portobello Road Market, one of London&#x27;s notable street markets, known for its second-hand clothes, pastries and antiques. Every August since 1996, the Portobello Film Festival has been held in locations around Portobello Road and, in 2015, Portobello Radio was founded as the area&#x27;s community radio station.

==History==

===Origins===
Portobello Road was known prior to 1740 as Green&#x27;s Lane – a winding country path leading from Kensington Gravel Pits, in what is now Notting Hill Gate, up to Kensal Green in the north. It descends from 84 feet (25.6 m) above sea level at the northern end, the highest point, to a lowest point of 65 feet (19.8 m) after which the road rises and falls before reaching a high point of 78 feet (23.8 m) at the southern end. The average grade of ascent or descent between the northern end and the lowest point is about 1.77 percent.

===18th century===
In 1740, Portobello Farm was built in the area near what is now Golborne Road. The farm got its name from the 1739 Battle of Porto Bello during the lost War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, when Admiral Edward Vernon captured the Spanish-ruled town of Puerto Bello (now known as Portobelo in modern-day Panama). Vernon Yard, which runs off Portobello Road, still honours the Admiral&#x27;s name to this day. The Portobello farming area covered the land which is now St Charles&#x27; Hospital.

===Urbanisation===

Portobello Road became an urban highway in the Victorian era. Before about 1850, it was little more than a country lane connecting Portobello Farm with Kensal Green in the north and what is today Notting Hill in the south. Much of it consisted of hayfields, orchards and other open land. The road ultimately took form piecemeal in the second half of the 19th century, nestling between the large new residential developments of Paddington and Notting Hill. Its shops and markets thrived on serving the wealthy inhabitants of the elegant crescents and terraces that sprang up around it, and its working-class residents found employment in the immediate vicinity as construction workers, domestic servants, coachmen, messengers, tradesmen and costermongers. After the Hammersmith and City Railway line was completed in 1864, and Ladbroke Grove station opened, the northern end of Portobello Road was also developed, and the last of the open fields disappeared under brick and concrete.

Portobello Farm was sold to an order of nuns after the railways came in 1864. They built St Joseph&#x27;s Convent for the Dominican Order - or the &quot;Black Friars&quot; as they were known in England.

A range of communities inhabit Portobello. Its architecture is characterised by meandering roads and curving streets, in contrast to the more formally planned layout of most of the nearby area. Mid- to late-Victorian terrace houses and shops predominate, squeezed tightly into the available space. The Friends of Portobello campaign seeks to preserve the street&#x27;s unique dynamic, and campaigns against branded chain stores. Portobello Road is also home to the Grade II* Electric Cinema, one of Britain&#x27;s oldest cinemas.

==Portobello Road Market==

Portobello Road Market draws thousands of tourists each year. The main market day for antiques is Saturday, the only day when all five sections are opened: second-hand goods, clothing and fashion, household essentials, fruit, vegetables and other food, and antiques. However, there are also clothing, antique, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetable stalls throughout the week and are located further north than the antiques, near the Westway Flyover. Shops and cafes are opened daily.

The market began as many other London markets and mainly sold fresh-food in the 19th century; antiques and wares dealers arrived in the late 1940s and &#x27;50s, and gradually antiques have become the main attraction of this market, having a substantial number of them trading mainly on Saturday mornings. It is the largest antiques market in the UK.

The market section of Portobello Road runs in a direction generally between the north-northwest and the south-south-east. The northern terminus is at Golborne Road; the southern end is at Westbourne Grove, to the east. The market area is about 1,028 yards (940 m) long.

About one third of the way from its north end, the market runs beneath adjacent bridges of the A40 road and the Hammersmith &amp; City line of the London Underground. Here the market focuses on second hand clothes as well as couture.

==In media==
=== Films ===
The market was the setting for the 1999 film &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, with much of the filming taking place on the street. The famed blue door, however, no longer exists, having been sold.

The 1950 Ealing Studios police thriller &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot;, starring Dirk Bogarde and Jack Warner, as P.C. George Dixon, a character later revived in the long-running TV drama, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, featured location filming in the Paddington/Notting Hill/Portobello area. It features good shots of these locations in pre-Westway days, and it includes a thrilling car chase along largely traffic-free roads, including Portobello Road.

The market was featured in the 1971 musical film &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; in a scene involving a song (&quot;Portobello Road&quot;) and dance in and around the market staged on sets built at Disney&#x27;s Burbank Studios. The lyrics refer to the market and the people who live and work there.

In 2006, the 20-minute documentary &quot;Portobello: Attack of the Clones&quot; won London awards and was screened a number of times at the infamous Electric Cinema. The film showed how Portobello Road is threatened by high-street stores changing the street&#x27;s independent spirit. It featured a large number of local stallholders and influencers, and it was made by local filmmakers Paul McCrudden and Alex Thomas for TAG Films.

Alice&#x27;s Antiques shop at the southern end of Portobello Road is also famous as being the location of Gruber&#x27;s Antiques in the Paddington Bear movies.

=== Theatre ===
The 1959 British musical &quot;Make Me an Offer&quot;, with book by Wolf Mankowitz based on his novel of the same title, and music and lyrics by David Heneker and Monty Norman, takes place on Portobello Road, and includes the song &quot;Portobello Road&quot;, sung by the ensemble. Another song, &quot;I Want a Lock-up&quot;, also refers to Portobello Road. The musical is available for licensing through Samuel French, Inc.

=== Literature ===

The Portobello Road features prominently in Martin Amis&#x27;s 1989 satirical novel &quot;London Fields.&quot;

In the short story &quot;The Portobello Road&quot;, Muriel Spark narrates the story of a murderer who, visited by the ghost of his victim, Macbeth-style, tends to constantly go to the Portobello Road market to meet her. &quot;The Portobello Road&quot; was included in the 1958 collection &quot;The Go-away Bird and Other Stories&quot;.

The cult British children&#x27;s book character Paddington Bear, featured in the books written by Michael Bond, enjoys visiting Portobello Market on a daily basis. His friend Mr. Gruber, with whom Paddington has his elevenses every day, owns an antique shop on the Portobello Road.

In Cathy Hopkins&#x27; &quot;Mates, Dates and Portobello Princess&quot;, the fourth book of her young adult &quot;Mates, Dates&quot; series, Nesta Williams who is from a middle-class North London family struggles to fit in as she starts dating rich Simon Peddington-Lee. 

In 2008, Ruth Rendell published a novel set in the area, entitled &quot;Portobello&quot;.

It is the setting for Paulo Coelho&#x27;s 2007 novel, &quot;The Witch of Portobello&quot;.

In the 1970 novel &quot;The Chinese Agent&quot; by Michael Moorcock, a world-renowned jewel-thief more than meets his match when he attempts to swipe a brooch from a Portobello Road market stall, and is hunted down through the streets like a dog by the sharp-eyed market traders.

Portobello Road is also mentioned in Indian Urdu writer Shamsur Rahman Faruqi&#x27;s 2006 novel &quot;The Mirror of Beauty&quot;.

In the short story &quot;Different Skies&quot; by China Miéville, the protagonist buys an eerie coloured window pane in Portobello Road Market. This story is included in the 2005 collection Looking for Jake.

=== Music ===
In 1979, the rock band Dire Straits sang about the road in the song &quot;Portobello Belle&quot; on their second album &quot;Communiqué&quot;.

In the narrative introduction to their song &quot;Have Some Madeira M&#x27;Dear&quot;, Michael Flanders of Flanders &amp; Swann mentions a decanter he owns – &quot;cut glass, from the Portobello Road&quot; – in which he keeps Madeira. That decanter plus his Edwardian hat, are credited as the inspirations for the song (album: &quot;At the Drop of a Hat&quot;).

Donovan&#x27;s song &quot;Sunny South Kensington&quot; containing the lyrics: &quot;...in the Portobella I met a fella with a cane umbrella.&quot;

The B-side of British Singer-Songwriter Cat Stevens&#x27; 1966 single &quot;I Love My Dog&quot; is titled &quot;Portobello Road&quot; and discusses a walk through the famous street and market. The track also appears on Cat Stevens&#x27; 1967 debut album &quot;Matthew and Son&quot;.

It is also referenced in the song &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; by alternative rock band Blur, from the 1993 album &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;, in which the opening lyrics are: &quot;Air cushioned soles, I bought them on the Portobello Road on a Saturday.&quot;

In Caetano Veloso&#x27;s &quot;Nine Out Of Ten&quot; song from the 1972 album &quot;Transa&quot;, he sings &quot;walk down Portobello Road to the sound of reggae&quot;. The Brazilian artist lived in London in the late 1960s and early 1970s during his exile.

David Gilmour&#x27;s song &quot;Sing&quot; on his 2024 Luck &amp; Strange album contains the lyric: &quot;Found a lifetime ago, Down the Portobello Road, Lovers&#x27; snapshots of delight, Those rosy days of black and white.&quot;.

=== TV ===
&quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, a UK TV sitcom about Rag and Bone men, frequently refers to the road.

In the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; episode &quot;Cash and Curry&quot;, conmen use a statue of Kubera they bought from Portobello Road to deceive Del Boy and Rodney Trotter. The episode&#x27;s writer, John Sullivan, had the idea after visiting the street.

The street and its name also appeared regularly on the hit TV series &quot;Minder&quot;.

BBC One&#x27;s daytime antiques-based gameshow &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; regularly features contestants buying items at the market to sell later at auction.

The 1977 to 1983 Italian television broadcast RAI was named &quot;Portobello&quot; after Portobello Road.

<text>A straddling checkerboard is a device for converting an alphanumeric plaintext into digits whilst simultaneously achieving fractionation (a simple form of information diffusion) and data compression relative to other schemes using digits. It also is known as a monôme-binôme cipher.

==History==
In 1555, Pope Paul IV created the office of Cipher Secretary to the Pontiff. In the late 1580s, this position was held by members of the Argenti family, most notably Giovanni Batista and his nephew, Matteo. Matteo was the first to intentionally obscure borders between one-digit and two-digit codes, designing the first variable length cipher, although this was still a substitution cipher:
With that cipher, &quot;La vigilanza di papa Clemente fu grande in ogni genere de negotii&quot; was enciphered as 550365178370360088658074864865534032402000824315833060080257009830075583200230258020028390875.

The following table rearranges the same key so that the column number corresponds to the second digit and while the row correspond to the first digit or lack thereof:
Comparing this table with a lower one, it is evident that it is not the modern straddling checkerboard, and letters encoded with one digit are not the most frequent letters of Latin (T is much more frequent than O), but the idea exploited in the latter ciphers is present.

In its modern form described below the cipher&#x27;s first documented use was in 1937 by Swedish communist during the Spanish Civil War. It was later used as the basis for the message-to-digits step in the VIC cipher.

==Mechanics==
===Setup===
A straddling checkerboard is set up something like this:
The header row is populated with the ten digits, 0-9. They can be presented in order, as in the above table, or scrambled (based on a secret key value) for additional security. The second row is typically set up with eight high-frequency letters (mnemonics for the English language include; &#x27;ESTONIA-R&#x27;, &#x27;A SIN TO ER(R)&#x27;, &#x27;AT ONE SIR&#x27;, &#x27;AERO TINS&#x27;), leaving two blank spots; this row has no row coordinate in the first column. The remaining two rows are labeled with one of the two digits that were not assigned a letter in the second row, and then filled out with the rest of the alphabet, plus the two symbols &#x27;.&#x27; and &#x27;/&#x27;.
* The period &#x27;.&#x27; is used as a full stop or decimal separator,
* The slash &#x27;/&#x27; is used as a numeric escape character (indicating that a numeral follows).

Similar to the ordering of the digits in the header row, the alphabet characters can be presented in order (as it is here), or scrambled based on a secret keyword/phrase.

===Enciphering===
Letter-Encipherment: To encipher a letter in the second row is simply replaced by the number labeling its column. Characters in the third and fourth rows are replaced by a two-digit number representing their row and column numbers (with the row coordinate written first, i.e. B=20)

Digit-Encipherment: To encipher a digit, there are a few possible methods (which must be known/agreed beforehand):
* &quot;Single Digit Escape&quot;: Encode the numerical escape character (i.e. the slash &#x27;/&#x27;) as per any letter, then write the required digit &#x27;in-clear&#x27;. This means a digit is encrypted by 3 ciphertext characters; 2 for the escape character, 1 for the digit itself. In this scheme, each digit requires an escape character encoded before it.
* &quot;Double-Digit Scheme&quot;: If the escape character is encoded by two different digits (e.g. &#x27;26&#x27; in the example above), then multiple digits can be encoded by writing each out twice. To &#x27;escape&#x27; back to text the escape character is used. In this way a stream of digits can be encoded with only one escape character. This method cannot be used if the escape character is itself encoded by a double digit combination. 
* &quot;Triple-Digit Scheme&quot;: As per the double-digit scheme above, but triple digits are used. This was the mechanism used in the VIC cipher.&#x27;

====Example====
The table below shows the conversion of string &quot;ATTACK AT DAWN&quot; into numbers using the straddling checkerboard setup above.

The resulting message, 3113212731223655 has to be secured by other means if the straddling checkerboard table is not scrambled. By passing digits through an additional transposition or substitution cipher stage can be used to secure message -- to whatever extent transposition or substitution can be considered secure.

For example, securing the message above using as a secret key digits &quot;0452&quot; -- digits of the secret key are repeated to get at least as many digits as there are digits in the message -- and adding modulo 10 for transposition produces:

The message can also be ciphered with a substitution cipher using the same straddling checkerboard to convert the digits back to letters again:
Deciphering is simply the reverse of these processes. Although the size of groups can vary, deciphering is unambiguous because whenever the next element to be deciphered starts with a 2 or a 6, it is a pair; otherwise, it is a singleton. If the letter decoded is the numerical escape character &#x27;/&#x27; then the next 1+ digits (depending on scheme) are to be interpreted as a digit.

==Cryptographic properties==
Compression: The more common characters are encoded by only one character, instead of two; this reduces the ciphertext size and potentially the cipher&#x27;s proneness to a frequency attack.

Fractionation: Unlike in the Polybius Square (where every character is represented by a pair of digits), a straddling checkerboard will not encrypt each character with the same number of ciphertext digits. This makes it harder for a cryptanalysts to determine the boundaries between plaintext characters. This may be combined with a transposition (as it is in the VIC cipher) in order to locate the ciphertext letters of the same plaintext character at unknown locations in the ciphertext.

<text>Jõgeva County ( or &quot;Jõgevamaa&quot;) is one of 15 counties of Estonia. It is situated in eastern part of the country and borders Ida-Viru County to the north-east, Lake Peipus to the east, Tartu County to the south, Viljandi County to the south-west, Järva County to the north-west and Lääne-Viru County to the north.

== History ==
Jõgeva County or Jõgevamaa was created January 1, 1990 from a parts of Viljandimaa and Tartumaa counties.

== County government ==
The County government (Estonian: &quot;Maavalitsus&quot;) was led by a governor (Estonian: &quot;maavanem&quot;), who was appointed by the Government of Estonia for a term of five years. Since 2009 until 2018, the Jõgeva County governor position was held by Viktor Svjatõšev. From 01.01.2018 County governments were shut down in Estonia.

== Municipalities ==

The county is subdivided into municipalities. There are three rural municipalities (Estonian: &quot;vallad&quot; – parishes) in Jõgeva County.
== Religion ==
The following congregations of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (EELC) operate in Jõgeva  County: Jõgeva,  Kursi, Laiuse,  Lohusuu,  Avinurme,  Maarja-Magdaleena, Mustvee, Palamuse and  Torma congregation under EELC&#x27;s Tartu Deanery and  Põltsamaa congregation under EELC&#x27;s Viljandi Deanery.

Regarding Eastern Orthodoxy, there are under the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church congregations in Põltsamaa and Kaarepere. An  Orthodox congregation in Mustvee operates under the jurisdiction of the Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate
The  congregation of Mercy and the Holy Trinity, which operates in Mustvee, is an independent Orthodox congregation that does not belong to the canonical jurisdiction of either the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church or the Moscow Patriarchate.
Old Believer congregations operate in Mustvee, Raja and Kükita.

There are three Baptist congregations in the county, and Adventists and other Christians also have their congregations.

<doc id="396000" wikidata="Q505535" url="?curid=396000" title="Somatic nervous system">
<text>The somatic nervous system (SNS), also known as voluntary nervous system, is a part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that links brain and spinal cord to skeletal muscles under conscious control, as well as to sensory receptors in the skin. The other part complementary to the somatic nervous system is the autonomic nervous system (ANS). 

The somatic nervous system consists of nerves carrying afferent nerve fibers, which relay sensation from the body to the central nervous system (CNS), and nerves carrying efferent nerve fibers, which relay motor commands from the CNS to stimulate muscle contraction. Specialized nerve fiber ends called sensory receptors are responsible for detecting information both inside and outside the body.

The &quot;a-&quot; of &quot;afferent&quot; and the &quot;e-&quot; of &quot;efferent&quot; correspond to the prefixes &quot;ad-&quot; (to, toward) and &quot;ex-&quot; (out of).

== Structure ==
There are 43 segments of nerves in the human body. With each segment, there is a pair of sensory and motor nerves. 31 segments of nerves are in the spinal cord and 12 are in the brain stem. Interneurons also known as association neurons are present throughout the central nervous system forming links between the sensory and motor fibres.
Thus the somatic nervous system consists of two parts:
* Spinal nerves: They are mixed nerves that carry sensory information into and motor commands out of the spinal cord. The spinal nerves serve as a bridge between the environment and the central nervous system (CNS). These neurons work together to transfer autonomic, sensory, and motor impulses from the spinal cord to the body&#x27;s other systems. The spinal nerves are arranged into 31 pairs according to the regions of the spinal cord. To be more precise, there are eight pairs of cervical nerves (C1–C8), twelve pairs of thoracic nerves (T1–T12), five pairs of lumbar nerves (L1–L5), five pairs of sacral nerves (S1–S5), and one pair of coccygeal nerves. Peripheral nerves are included in the category of peripheral nervous system.
* Cranial nerves: They are the nerve fibers that carry information into and out of the brain stem. They include smell, eye muscles, mouth, taste, ear, neck, shoulders, and tongue. Partially innervating the head and neck structures are the cranial nerves, which supply afferent and efferent functions. Neural processes connected to certain brainstem nuclei and cortical regions make up cranial nerves, in contrast to spinal nerves, which have neural fibers originating from the spinal grey matter as their roots. The cranial nerves VIII (vestibulocochlear), II (optic), and I (olfactory) are regarded as entirely afferent. The exclusively efferent cranial nerves are XI (spinal accessory), XII (hypoglossal), VI (abducens), IV (trochlear), and III (oculomotor). The remaining cranial nerves, X (vagus), IX (glossopharyngeal), VII (facial), and V (trigeminal), have mixed sensory and motor functions. Anatomically, cranial nerves are numbered from I to XII, which indicates their sequential origin from the caudal to the ventral brainstem. Alternatively, they can be postulated in groups based on the developmental functions they perform (sensory, motor, mixed).

== Function ==

The somatic nervous system&#x27;s principal goal is to facilitate the organs and striated muscles of the central nervous system so that we can carry out our daily responsibilities.

The primary motor cortex, or precentral gyrus, is home to the higher motor neurons that make up the basic motor pathway. These neurons transmit signals to the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord through axons known as the corticospinal tract. These impulses move to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of skeletal muscle via peripheral axons after synapsing with the lower motor neurons through the ventral horn of the spinal cord. A signal that travels to the NMJ, which innervates muscles, is produced by the release of acetylcholine by upper motor neurons. Acetylcholine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of alpha-motor neurons.

The somatic nervous system controls all voluntary muscular systems within the body, and the process of voluntary reflex arcs.

The basic route of nerve signals within the efferent somatic nervous system involves a sequence that begins in the upper cell bodies of motor neurons (upper motor neurons) within the precentral gyrus (which approximates the primary motor cortex). Stimuli from the precentral gyrus are transmitted from upper motor neurons, down the corticospinal tract, to lower motor neurons (alpha motor neurons) in the brainstem and ventral horn of the spinal cord: upper motor neurons release a neurotransmitter called glutamate from their axon terminal knobs, which is received by glutamate receptors on the lower motor neurons: from there, acetylcholine is released from the axon terminal knobs of alpha motor neurons and received by postsynaptic receptors (nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) of muscles, thereby relaying the stimulus to contract muscle fibers.

===Reflex arcs===
A reflex arc is a neural circuit that creates a more or less automatic link between a sensory input and a specific motor output. Reflex circuits vary in complexity—the simplest spinal reflexes are mediated by a two-element chain, of which in the human body there is only one, also called a monosynaptic reflex (there is only one synapse between the two neurones taking part in the arc: sensory and motor). The singular example of a monosynaptic reflex is the patellar reflex. The next simplest reflex arc is a three-element chain, beginning with sensory neurons, which activate interneurons inside of the spinal cord, which then activate motor neurons. Some reflex responses, such as withdrawing the hand after touching a hot surface, are protective, but others, such as the patellar reflex (&quot;knee jerk&quot;) activated by tapping the patellar tendon, contribute to ordinary behavior.

==Clinical Significance==
A medical condition known as peripheral neuropathy affects the somatic nervous system&#x27;s peripheral nerve fibers.
They can be divided into congenital and acquired disorders based on the causes. They can also be categorized based on whether the myelin sheath(demyelinating neuropathy) or axons (axonal neuropathy) have the predominant disease. There is a wide range of causes for axonal peripheral neuropathy, most of which are toxic-metabolic in origin and include group B vitamin deficiencies and diabetes.
Demyelinating neuropathies do not vary with length. They are frequently immune-mediated, which causes a more widespread involvement of sensorimotor function and an early loss of deep tendon reflexes. When joint position and vibratory sensory loss are present, sensory participation is more selective.

Defects in the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, or muscle itself are the cause of numerous congenital illnesses of sensory and motor function.
Owing to the vast territory encompassed by the somatic nerve system, these ailments may manifest as localized in nature, or as broad and systemic. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Myasthenia gravis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome are a few instances of them.

=== Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) ===
The Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease group comprises diverse hereditary illnesses that manifest as chronic, progressive neuropathy that affects both the motor and sensory neurons.

=== Myasthenia Gravis (MG) ===
An autoimmune neurological condition called myasthenia gravis (MG) is typified by impaired neuromuscular junction communication.

=== Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) ===
A rare but dangerous post-infectious immune-mediated neuropathy is Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). It is brought on by an autoimmune reaction that destroys peripheral nervous system nerves, leading to symptoms including tingling, weakness, and numbness that can become paralysis.

==Signs of Somatic Nervous System Problems==
Depending on whether the damage is to the motor nerves, which regulate movement, or the sensory nerves, which affect the senses, the symptoms of a somatic nervous system problem can differ.

Damage to the motor nerves shows as:
* Loss of movement control
* Spasms or cramps in muscles
* Tremors or twitching
* Wasting of muscles (muscle atrophy)

The following signs could be present if the sensory system is damaged:
* Inability to feel things you touch
* Numbness or tingling
* Sharp or burning pain in the damaged area

==Other animals==
In invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could either be excitatory or inhibitory. For vertebrates, however, the response of a skeletal striated muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter – always acetylcholine (ACh) – can only be excitatory.

<text>Mike Clattenburg (born March 21, 1967) is a Canadian television and film director, producer and screenwriter. He is best known as creator, executive producer, writer and director of the comedy series &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; (2001–2007), for his work with &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; (2004), and as the co-creator of the Adult Swim series &quot;Black Jesus&quot; (2014–2019).

== Early life ==
A native of Cole Harbour, a suburb of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Clattenburg spent his years after high school as drummer in a Police-inspired rock band, The Spawning Grunions.

He was formerly married to filmmaker Stephanie Joline from 2009 to 2015.

== Career ==
Clattenburg&#x27;s jump from music to television began with his co-hosting and production of a Halifax Cable 10 show, &quot;That Damn Cable Show&quot;, from 1990 to 1993. The program featured on-location interviews and profiles of Halifax entertainers, many of whom were acquaintances of Clattenburg&#x27;s through his band contacts. Wedged in between the entertainer segments were comedic three-minute clips that displayed his early talent for irreverent film making. &quot;That Damn Cable Show&quot; was remarkable for its high production values despite being a local cable channel production on a shoestring budget, and made an early name for Clattenburg in film production circles.

Outgrowing the local cable television station, Clattenburg made the move to professional television production with work on comedy and drama programs at CBC Television, including &quot;Pit Pony&quot;, &quot;Street Cents&quot;, &quot;The Bette Show&quot;, and a variety of segments for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. His credits include the direction of music videos for Gord Downie, Len, The Tragically Hip, comedy rap group Three Loco, and, most recently, a rap video for Far East Movement featuring Riff Raff of Three Loco.

In addition to &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; and its associated films &quot;Trailer Park Boys: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day&quot; and &quot;Trailer Park Boys 3: Don&#x27;t Legalize It&quot;, Clattenburg also directed the films &quot;Afghan Luke&quot; and &quot;Moving Day&quot;, which were released in Toronto and Halifax on July 20, 2012, and the short film &quot;Crackin&#x27; Down Hard&quot;.

He is co-creator, executive producer, co-writer (along with Aaron McGruder), and director of the Adult Swim series &quot;Black Jesus&quot;, which premiered on August 7, 2014.

He is co-creator (along with Mike O&#x27;Neill from Trailer Park Boys), director and an executive producer of Canadian television comedy series &quot;Crawford&quot;, which premiered as a streaming video on February 2, 2018.

<text>Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (; 16 December 1805 – 10 November 1861) was a French zoologist and an authority on deviation from normal structure. In 1854 he coined the term &quot;éthologie&quot; (ethology).

== Biography ==

He was born in Paris, the son of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. In his earlier years he showed an aptitude for mathematics, but eventually he devoted himself to the study of natural history and of medicine, and in 1824 he was appointed assistant naturalist to his father. In 1829 he delivered for his father the second part of a course of lectures on ornithology, and during the following three years he taught zoology at the &quot;Athénée&quot;, and teratology at the &quot;École pratique&quot;.

He was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1833, was in 1837 appointed to act as deputy for his father at the faculty of sciences in Paris. During the following year he was sent to Bordeaux to organize a similar faculty there. He became successively; inspector of the academy of Paris (1840), professor of the museum on the retirement of his father (1841), inspector-general of the university (1844), a member of the royal council for public instruction (1845), and on the death of Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, professor of zoology at the Faculty of Sciences (1850). In 1854 he founded the &quot;Société zoologique d&#x27;acclimatation&quot; (Zoological Acclimatization Society), of which he also served as president.

He conducted investigations of omphalosites, celosomia, hermaphroditism, etc., and is credited with introducing the term &quot;teratologie&quot;. From 1832 to 1837 he published his great teratological work, &quot;Histoire générale et particulière des anomalies de l’organisation chez l’homme et les animaux&quot;.

<doc id="396014" wikidata="Q3075294" url="?curid=396014" title="Local zeta function">
<text>In mathematics, the local zeta function (sometimes called the congruent zeta function or the Hasse–Weil zeta function) is defined as

:formula_1

where is a non-singular -dimensional projective algebraic variety over the field with elements and is the number of points of defined over the finite field extension of .

Making the variable transformation gives
:formula_2
as the formal power series in the variable formula_3.

Equivalently, the local zeta function is sometimes defined as follows: 
:formula_4
:formula_5

In other words, the local zeta function with coefficients in the finite field is defined as a function whose logarithmic derivative generates the number of solutions of the equation defining in the degree extension 

==Formulation==

Given a finite field &quot;F&quot;, there is, up to isomorphism, only one field &quot;Fk&quot; with

:formula_6,

for &quot;k&quot; = 1, 2, ... . When &quot;F&quot; is the unique field with &quot;q&quot; elements, &quot;Fk&quot; is the unique field with formula_7 elements. Given a set of polynomial equations — or an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; — defined over &quot;F&quot;, we can count the number

:formula_8

of solutions in &quot;Fk&quot; and create the generating function

:formula_9.

The correct definition for &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is to set log &quot;Z&quot; equal to &quot;G&quot;, so

:formula_10

and &quot;Z&quot;(0) = 1, since &quot;G&quot;(0) = 0, and &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is &quot;a priori&quot; a formal power series.

The logarithmic derivative

:formula_11

equals the generating function

:formula_12.

==Examples==

For example, assume all the &quot;Nk&quot; are 1; this happens for example if we start with an equation like &quot;X&quot; = 0, so that geometrically we are taking &quot;V&quot; to be a point. Then

:formula_13

is the expansion of a logarithm (for |&quot;t&quot;| &lt; 1). In this case we have

:formula_14

To take something more interesting, let &quot;V&quot; be the projective line over &quot;F&quot;. If &quot;F&quot; has &quot;q&quot; elements, then this has &quot;q&quot; + 1 points, including the one point at infinity. Therefore, we have

:formula_15

and

:formula_16

for |&quot;t&quot;| small enough, and therefore

:formula_17

The first study of these functions was in the 1923 dissertation of Emil Artin. He obtained results for the case of a hyperelliptic curve, and conjectured the further main points of the theory as applied to curves. The theory was then developed by F. K. Schmidt and Helmut Hasse. The earliest known nontrivial cases of local zeta functions were implicit in Carl Friedrich Gauss&#x27;s &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;, article 358. There, certain particular examples of elliptic curves over finite fields having complex multiplication have their points counted by means of cyclotomy.

For the definition and some examples, see also.

==Motivations==

The relationship between the definitions of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; can be explained in a number of ways. (See for example the infinite product formula for &quot;Z&quot; below.) In practice it makes &quot;Z&quot; a rational function of &quot;t&quot;, something that is interesting even in the case of &quot;V&quot; an elliptic curve over a finite field.

The local &quot;Z&quot; zeta functions are multiplied to get global &quot;formula_18&quot; zeta functions,

formula_19

These generally involve different finite fields (for example the whole family of fields Z/&quot;p&quot;Z as &quot;p&quot; runs over all prime numbers).

In these fields, the variable &quot;t&quot; is substituted by &quot;p−s&quot;, where &quot;s&quot; is the complex variable traditionally used in Dirichlet series. (For details see Hasse–Weil zeta function.)

The global products of &quot;Z&quot; in the two cases used as examples in the previous section therefore come out as formula_20 and formula_21 after letting formula_22.

==Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields==

For projective curves &quot;C&quot; over &quot;F&quot; that are non-singular, it can be shown that

:formula_23

with &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) a polynomial, of degree 2&quot;g&quot;, where &quot;g&quot; is the genus of &quot;C&quot;. Rewriting

:formula_24

the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields states

:formula_25

For example, for the elliptic curve case there are two roots, and it is easy to show the absolute values of the roots are &quot;q&quot;1/2. Hasse&#x27;s theorem is that they have the same absolute value; and this has immediate consequences for the number of points.

André Weil proved this for the general case, around 1940 (&quot;Comptes Rendus&quot; note, April 1940): he spent much time in the years after that writing up the algebraic geometry involved. This led him to the general Weil conjectures. Alexander Grothendieck developed scheme theory for the purpose of resolving these.
A generation later Pierre Deligne completed the proof. 
(See étale cohomology for the basic formulae of the general theory.)

==General formulas for the zeta function==

It is a consequence of the Lefschetz trace formula for the Frobenius morphism that

:formula_26

Here formula_27 is a separated scheme of finite type over the finite field &quot;F&quot; with formula_28 elements, and Frobq is the geometric Frobenius acting on formula_29-adic étale cohomology with compact supports of formula_30, the lift of formula_27 to the algebraic closure of the field &quot;F&quot;. This shows that the zeta function is a rational function of formula_3.

An infinite product formula for formula_33 is

:formula_34

Here, the product ranges over all closed points &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot; and deg(&quot;x&quot;) is the degree of &quot;x&quot;.
The local zeta function &quot;Z(X, t)&quot; is viewed as a function of the complex variable &quot;s&quot; via the change of 
variables &quot;q−s&quot;.

In the case where &quot;X&quot; is the variety &quot;V&quot; discussed above, the closed points 
are the equivalence classes &quot;x=[P]&quot; of points &quot;P&quot; on formula_35, where two points are equivalent if they are conjugates over &quot;F&quot;. The degree of &quot;x&quot; is the degree of the field extension of &quot;F&quot;
generated by the coordinates of &quot;P&quot;. The logarithmic derivative of the infinite product &quot;Z(X, t)&quot; is easily seen to be the generating function discussed above, namely

:formula_36.

<doc id="396016" wikidata="Q947339" url="?curid=396016" title="OSI (band)">
<text>OSI was an American progressive rock band, originally formed by Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos in 2002. Chroma Key keyboardist and vocalist Kevin Moore is the only other full-time member of the band. The collaboration may be considered a studio project, as its members and contributors write and track most of their material independently, sharing and developing tracks long-distance, only coming together at the end of the process for mixing and additional tracking. The band&#x27;s name is a reference to the Office of Strategic Influence, a short-lived American government agency formed in 2001 to support the War on Terror through propaganda. The band has featured a number of guest musicians on its albums, including Sean Malone, Steven Wilson, Mikael Akerfeldt, Joey Vera and Gavin Harrison.

Matheos recruited Moore, Dream Theater&#x27;s drummer Mike Portnoy, and Sean Malone (Fretless Bass and Chapman Stickist) to perform on what was originally planned to be a Matheos solo album. Matheos and Portnoy originally planned to produce a progressive metal album similar to Matheos&#x27; work in Fates Warning, however Moore&#x27;s impact changed the music&#x27;s direction and genre, incorporating electronica into the original progressive metal sound. The band&#x27;s debut album was released by InsideOut Music in 2003.

OSI was originally intended to be a one-off project, but Matheos and Moore found they both had gaps in their schedules so produced a follow-up. &quot;Free&quot; was released in 2006, with Portnoy returning to play drums as a session musician rather than a full band member, due to personal and musical differences between him and Moore. &quot;Blood&quot; was released in 2009, with Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison replacing Portnoy. The fourth album &quot;Fire Make Thunder&quot; was released in 2012 by Metal Blade Records, with Harrison once again on drums.

==History==

===Formation and &quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot; (2002–2003)===

Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos originally intended to create a progressive metal supergroup while Fates Warning went on hiatus. He recruited Cynic &amp; Gordian Knot fretless bass and Chapman Stickist Sean Malone and Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy to work on the project. Matheos then asked Chroma Key and ex-Dream Theater keyboardist Kevin Moore to contribute by adding keyboard arrangements to the music he had written. Moore instead heavily edited the music, changing the song structures and adding vocals. Matheos decided to pursue this new direction, sounding closer to Chroma Key than standard progressive metal, over his and Portnoy&#x27;s original idea.

Many vocalists were considered to perform on the album; Matheos and Portnoy briefly considered having a different vocalist perform on each track. Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation wrote some vocal melodies and lyrics, but Moore ultimately performed most of the vocals and wrote most of the lyrics. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track. Cynic and Gordian Knot bassist Sean Malone performed bass, but was credited as a guest musician because his schedule meant he was unable to join Matheos, Moore and Portnoy for the basic tracking sessions.

Matheos, Moore and Portnoy recorded the album at Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut from June 2 to 9, 2002. Songs with a strong progressive metal influence were mostly written by Matheos, while Moore had greater influence over the vocal-driven tracks. Portnoy made minor arrangement suggestions but did not take part in the actual writing of the album. The album&#x27;s recording sessions were the first time Moore and Portnoy collaborated since 1994 in their work in Dream Theater. In 2009, Portnoy recalled that he found the experience of making the record difficult, and that he was frustrated by the lack of collaboration between him and Moore. Differences between Moore and Portnoy led to his return on the follow-up album as a session drummer rather than full-time member.

InsideOut Music released &quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot; on February 17, 2003. Moore chose the group&#x27;s name and album&#x27;s title, referring to the Office of Strategic Influence, established by the US Government after the September 11 attacks to spread propaganda. The album was critically well received. Critics praised the members&#x27; musicianship and the fact that the album differed significantly from the members&#x27; other projects.

===&quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Blood&quot; (2005–2009)===

Matheos and Moore did not plan to make a second OSI album, and returned to their own projects after the first album&#x27;s completion. In 2005, they both had free schedules, so decided to produce a follow-up album. Joey Vera (also of Fates Warning) played bass on the album. Portnoy originally told Matheos and Moore that he did not want to perform drums on the album, but was persuaded to perform on the album as a session musician.

&quot;Free&quot; was released on April 24, 2006, receiving generally positive critical reception. Critics noted that the album was darker and more keyboard-focused than the band&#x27;s debut. &quot;&quot;, an EP featuring remixes of three tracks from &quot;Free&quot;, was released on October 24, 2006. The band were keen to tour in support of &quot;Free&quot;, but no live shows materialised. &quot;The reality of it is in order to [tour] the way we would like... and present it the way we would want to present it... would cost too much money for the kind of fan base that we have right now,&quot; Matheos said in 2009. In 2010 he anticipated that OSI will &quot;remain a studio band.&quot;

In September 2008, Moore posted an update on the Chroma Key website, stating that he and Matheos had been working on a third OSI album for several months. Portnoy was replaced by Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison and Matheos played bass on the album. Opeth vocalist and guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt and No-Man vocalist Tim Bowness wrote lyrics and sang on one track each.

&quot;Blood&quot; was released on April 27, 2009 in Europe and May 19 in North America. The album received positive reviews: Andrew Reilly of Madeloud said that &quot;with &quot;Blood&quot; the two have finally found the stylistic fusion their first two discs hinted at&quot;, and praised Harrison&#x27;s drumming.

===&quot;Fire Make Thunder&quot; (2010–2012)===
In 2010, OSI signed with Metal Blade Records. The label reissued &quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot; on September 28, 2010.

Written and recorded throughout most of 2011, OSI&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Fire Make Thunder&quot; was released on March 27, 2012. Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree was once again enlisted as session drummer along with a co-writing credit for the song &quot;Enemy Prayer&quot;. All other instruments and programming were performed by Matheos and Moore, while lyrics and vocals were handled exclusively by Moore. The recordings for the album, with the exception of drums, were performed at the musician&#x27;s respective home studio. In July 2011 at Sound Farm Studio &amp; Recording Environment final overdubs as well as some additional writing and arranging were completed. The band mixed the album alongside engineer Matt Sepanic. Engineer Roger Siebel handled the final mastering. The record was produced by both Moore and Matheos. During the development process, Kevin Moore kept frequent updates referring to the mixing process of the album on his official Facebook and Twitter accounts.

===Hiatus (2013–present)===
On the current status of O.S.I., co-founder and lead guitarist Jim Matheos offered the following quote in a June 2016 interview about the possibility of a future album, &quot;No, as I just said it&#x27;s the same situation with John. Kevin and I are both busy doing other things. I believe Kevin is experimenting and working on some Chroma Key material right now, so who knows… In the future I would love to do it and if it happens that&#x27;s great, but there are no plans right now. My main focus for at least the rest of this year and probably next year is going to be Fates Warning.&quot;

==Musical style==
Moore has described OSI&#x27;s sound as &quot;a new approach to progressive rock&quot;, combining elements of progressive metal and electronica. Moore considers the two genres to be &quot;almost natural enemies&quot;, and that the conflict between the two genres &quot;keeps [the music] interesting&quot;. Matheos cites progressive rock and heavy metal bands such as Genesis, Jethro Tull, Black Sabbath and UFO as influences. Moore described his influences as minimal techno, experimental, electronic musicians and &quot;bands that play live and then chop it up&quot;.

Matheos and Moore primarily work alone, exchanging files and ideas by email. The writing process for all OSI&#x27;s albums has been the same, with Matheos sending Moore an idea &quot;from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs&quot;, which Moore then edits and sends back to Matheos. Moore, the band&#x27;s vocalist and lyricist, has described the process of writing lyrics as an &quot;audio Rorschach test&quot;. The lyrics on &quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot; feature political themes, but the lyrics on later releases are less political, instead being based on Moore&#x27;s personal experiences. &quot;I&#x27;ll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something,&quot; he said, &quot;but then by the time I&#x27;m finished the lyrics it&#x27;ll be about a relationship or something like that.&quot; On &quot;Blood&quot;, Moore largely abandoned his earlier stream-of-consciousness approach to writing lyrics, in an attempt to make the lyrics more coherent. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want it to be like &#x27;Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!&#x27; I wanted to have an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable,&quot; he explained.

Moore has acknowledged the narrow range of his vocals. He considers his vocal style to &quot;[come] from how I feel when I&#x27;m singing, when I&#x27;m in the zone of writing lyrics and recording which, a lot of times, comes as the same time. It&#x27;s sort of an introspective time. A lot of the material lends itself to that kind of voice and that kind of spirit.&quot;

<text>The Lautaro Lodge () was a revolutionary secret lodge active in Latin American politics in the 19th century. It was initially known as the Lodge of Rational Knights (). Its initial purposes were to apply the goals of the Spanish Enlightenment, and when Spain began the Absolutist Restoration they promoted instead the emancipation of the South American colonies.

==Creation in Europe==

It was for many years believed to have been founded as an extension of the British lodge &quot;The Great American Reunion&quot;, created by Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda. However, recent research suggests that the Lodge was founded in Cadiz, Spain, and that Miranda was not amongst its founders, as he himself was living in Paris at the time, from where he returned to London in January 1798. As with other secret societies, such details are difficult to investigate by historians, given the secrecy of their activities. Both lodges had just a superficial compromise with freemasonry, taking advantage of their secret societies merely as a tool to promote liberal agendas, evading punishment from absolutist governments of the time.

==Buenos Aires==
A number of officers from the Peninsular War, such as José de San Martín, Carlos María de Alvear, José Matías Zapiola, Francisco Chilavert and Eduardo Kailitz left Cádiz and moved to Buenos Aires. They began to organise a secret lodge, similar to the one in Cádiz. There were other secret lodges already working in Buenos Aires: the anglophile lodges &quot;&quot;Hiram sons&quot; and &quot;Southern Star&quot;, and the &quot;Patriotic Society&quot;&quot; that united the former supporters of Mariano Moreno. This last lodge, opposed to the first two ones, was integrated into the new one created by the Spanish generals.

==Name==
Although the lodge is most commonly known as &quot;Lautaro&quot;, it did not employ that name during all of its existence. The name made reference to Mapuche leader Lautaro, which made sense in Santiago de Chile in the 1817-1820 period, but not in Buenos Aires in 1812 and much less in Europe. Historian Vicente Fidel López points that &quot;Lautaro&quot; was really a masonic code meaning &quot;Expedition to Chile&quot;, but similarly, Chile was not a military target for Buenos Aires in 1812. By that point, Chile was still in the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; period, and would not fall into royalist control until the 1814 Disaster of Rancagua. Although the secrecy makes difficult to investigate the purposes or even the name, Alcibíades Lappas considers instead that the lodge was named &quot;&quot;Lodge of Rational Knights&quot; in 1812, just like the Cádiz one, and that San Martín renamed it &quot;Lautaro&quot;&quot; when he recreated it in 1815, after the fall of Alvear.

<doc id="396022" wikidata="Q375175" url="?curid=396022" title="Euler equations (fluid dynamics)">
<text>In fluid dynamics, the Euler equations are a set of partial differential equations governing adiabatic and inviscid flow. They are named after Leonhard Euler. In particular, they correspond to the Navier–Stokes equations with zero viscosity and zero thermal conductivity.

The Euler equations can be applied to incompressible and compressible flows. The incompressible Euler equations consist of Cauchy equations for conservation of mass and balance of momentum, together with the incompressibility condition that the flow velocity is divergence-free. The compressible Euler equations consist of equations for conservation of mass, balance of momentum, and balance of energy, together with a suitable constitutive equation for the specific energy density of the fluid. Historically, only the equations of conservation of mass and balance of momentum were derived by Euler. However, fluid dynamics literature often refers to the full set of the compressible Euler equations – including the energy equation – as &quot;the compressible Euler equations&quot;.

The mathematical characters of the incompressible and compressible Euler equations are rather different. For constant fluid density, the incompressible equations can be written as a quasilinear advection equation for the fluid velocity together with an elliptic Poisson&#x27;s equation for the pressure. On the other hand, the compressible Euler equations form a quasilinear hyperbolic system of conservation equations.

The Euler equations can be formulated in a &quot;convective form&quot; (also called the &quot;Lagrangian form&quot;) or a &quot;conservation form&quot; (also called the &quot;Eulerian form&quot;). The convective form emphasizes changes to the state in a frame of reference moving with the fluid. The conservation form emphasizes the mathematical interpretation of the equations as conservation equations for a control volume fixed in space (which is useful
from a numerical point of view).

==History==
The Euler equations first appeared in published form in Euler&#x27;s article &quot;Principes généraux du mouvement des fluides&quot;, published in &quot;Mémoires de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences de Berlin&quot; in 1757 (although Euler had previously presented his work to the Berlin Academy in 1752). Prior work included contributions from the Bernoulli family as well as from Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert.

The Euler equations were among the first partial differential equations to be written down, after the wave equation. In Euler&#x27;s original work, the system of equations consisted of the momentum and continuity equations, and thus was underdetermined except in the case of an incompressible flow. An additional equation, which was called the adiabatic condition, was supplied by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1816.

During the second half of the 19th century, it was found that the equation related to the balance of energy must at all times be kept for compressible flows, and the adiabatic condition is a consequence of the fundamental laws in the case of smooth solutions. With the discovery of the special theory of relativity, the concepts of energy density, momentum density, and stress were unified into the concept of the stress–energy tensor, and energy and momentum were likewise unified into a single concept, the energy–momentum vector.

==Incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density==
In convective form (i.e., the form with the convective operator made explicit in the momentum equation), the incompressible Euler equations in case of density constant in time and uniform in space are:

where:
*formula_1 is the flow velocity vector, with components in an &quot;N&quot;-dimensional space formula_2,
*formula_3, for a generic function (or field) formula_4 denotes its material derivative in time with respect to the advective field formula_5 and
*formula_6 is the gradient of the specific (with the sense of &quot;per unit mass&quot;) thermodynamic work, the internal source term, and
*formula_7 is the flow velocity divergence.
* formula_8 represents body accelerations (per unit mass) acting on the continuum, for example gravity, inertial accelerations, electric field acceleration, and so on.

The first equation is the Euler momentum equation with uniform density (for this equation it could also not be constant in time). By expanding the material derivative, the equations become:
formula_9

In fact for a flow with uniform density formula_10 the following identity holds:
formula_11
where formula_12 is the mechanic pressure. The second equation is the incompressible constraint, stating the flow velocity is a solenoidal field (the order of the equations is not causal, but underlines the fact that the incompressible constraint is not a degenerate form of the continuity equation, but rather of the energy equation, as it will become clear in the following). Notably, the continuity equation would be required also in this incompressible case as an additional third equation in case of density varying in time &quot;or&quot; varying in space. For example, with density nonuniform in space but constant in time, the continuity equation to be added to the above set would correspond to:
formula_13

So the case of constant &quot;and&quot; uniform density is the only one not requiring the continuity equation as additional equation regardless of the presence or absence of the incompressible constraint. In fact, the case of incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density discussed here is a toy model featuring only two simplified equations, so it is ideal for didactical purposes even if with limited physical relevance.

The equations above thus represent respectively conservation of mass (1 scalar equation) and momentum (1 vector equation containing formula_14 scalar components, where formula_14 is the physical dimension of the space of interest). Flow velocity and pressure are the so-called &quot;physical variables&quot;.

In a coordinate system given by formula_16 the velocity and external force vectors formula_1 and formula_18 have components formula_19 and formula_20, respectively. Then the equations may be expressed in subscript notation as:

formula_21

where the formula_22 and formula_23 subscripts label the &quot;N&quot;-dimensional space components, and formula_24 is the Kroenecker delta. The use of Einstein notation (where the sum is implied by repeated indices instead of sigma notation) is also frequent.

===Properties===
Although Euler first presented these equations in 1755, many fundamental questions or concepts about them remain unanswered.

In three space dimensions, in certain simplified scenarios, the Euler equations produce singularities.

Smooth solutions of the free (in the sense of without source term: g=0) equations satisfy the conservation of specific kinetic energy:
formula_25

In the one-dimensional case without the source term (both pressure gradient and external force), the momentum equation becomes the inviscid Burgers&#x27; equation:
formula_26

This model equation gives many insights into Euler equations.

===Nondimensionalisation===
In order to make the equations dimensionless, a characteristic length formula_27, and a characteristic velocity formula_28, need to be defined. These should be chosen such that the dimensionless variables are all of order one. The following dimensionless variables are thus obtained:
formula_29
and of the field unit vector:
formula_30

Substitution of these inversed relations in Euler equations, defining the Froude number, yields (omitting the * at apix):
 \hat{\mathbf{g}}\\
 \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Euler equations in the Froude limit (no external field) are named free equations and are conservative. The limit of high Froude numbers (low external field) is thus notable and can be studied with perturbation theory.

===Conservation form===

The conservation form emphasizes the mathematical properties of Euler equations, and especially the contracted form is often the most convenient one for computational fluid dynamics simulations. Computationally, there are some advantages in using the conserved variables. This gives rise to a large class of numerical methods
called conservative methods.

The free Euler equations are conservative, in the sense they are equivalent to a conservation equation:
formula_31
or simply in Einstein notation:
formula_32
where the conservation quantity formula_33 in this case is a vector, and formula_34 is a flux matrix. This can be simply proved.

At last Euler equations can be recast into the particular equation:

===Spatial dimensions===
For certain problems, especially when used to analyze compressible flow in a duct or in case the flow is cylindrically or spherically symmetric, the one-dimensional Euler equations are a useful first approximation. Generally, the Euler equations are solved by Riemann&#x27;s method of characteristics. This involves finding curves in plane of independent variables (i.e., formula_35 and formula_36) along which partial differential equations (PDEs) degenerate into ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Numerical solutions of the Euler equations rely heavily on the method of characteristics.

==Incompressible Euler equations==
In convective form the incompressible Euler equations in case of density variable in space are:

where the additional variables are:
*formula_37 is the fluid mass density,
*formula_12 is the pressure, formula_39.

The first equation, which is the new one, is the incompressible continuity equation. In fact the general continuity equation would be:
formula_40

but here the last term is identically zero for the incompressibility constraint.

===Conservation form===

The incompressible Euler equations in the Froude limit are equivalent to a single conservation equation with conserved quantity and associated flux respectively:
formula_41

Here formula_33 has length formula_43 and formula_34 has size formula_45.
In general (not only in the Froude limit) Euler equations are expressible as:
formula_46

===Conservation variables===
The variables for the equations in conservation form are not yet optimised. In fact we could define:
formula_47
where formula_48 is the momentum density, a conservation variable.

where formula_49 is the force density, a conservation variable.

==Euler equations==
In differential convective form, the compressible (and most general) Euler equations can be written shortly with the material derivative notation:

{Dt} &amp;= -\frac{\nabla p}{\rho} + \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]

where the additional variables here is:
*formula_50 is the specific internal energy (internal energy per unit mass).

The equations above thus represent conservation of mass, momentum, and energy: the energy equation expressed in the variable internal energy allows to understand the link with the incompressible case, but it is not in the simplest form.
Mass density, flow velocity and pressure are the so-called &quot;convective variables&quot; (or physical variables, or lagrangian variables), while mass density, momentum density and total energy density are the so-called &quot;conserved variables&quot; (also called eulerian, or mathematical variables).

If one expands the material derivative the equations above are:
formula_51

===Incompressible constraint (revisited)===
Coming back to the incompressible case, it now becomes apparent that the &quot;incompressible constraint&quot; typical of the former cases actually is a particular form valid for incompressible flows of the &quot;energy equation&quot;, and not of the mass equation. In particular, the incompressible constraint corresponds to the following very simple energy equation:
formula_52

Thus for an incompressible inviscid fluid the specific internal energy is constant along the flow lines, also in a time-dependent flow. The pressure in an incompressible flow acts like a Lagrange multiplier, being the multiplier of the incompressible constraint in the energy equation, and consequently in incompressible flows it has no thermodynamic meaning. In fact, thermodynamics is typical of compressible flows and degenerates in incompressible flows.

Basing on the mass conservation equation, one can put this equation in the conservation form:
formula_53
meaning that for an incompressible inviscid nonconductive flow a continuity equation holds for the internal energy.

===Enthalpy conservation===
Since by definition the specific enthalpy is:
formula_54

The material derivative of the specific internal energy can be expressed as:
formula_55

Then by substituting the momentum equation in this expression, one obtains:
formula_56

And by substituting the latter in the energy equation, one obtains that the enthalpy expression for the Euler energy equation:
formula_57
In a reference frame moving with an inviscid and nonconductive flow, the variation of enthalpy directly corresponds to a variation of pressure.

===Thermodynamics of ideal fluids===
In thermodynamics the independent variables are the specific volume, and the specific entropy, while the specific energy is a function of state of these two variables.

{v^2} \cdot \nabla v - \frac 1 {v^2} \frac {\partial v}{\partial t} = - \frac 1 v \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

And by multiplication:
formula_58

This equation is the only belonging to general continuum equations, so only this equation have the same form for example also in Navier-Stokes equations.

On the other hand, the pressure in thermodynamics is the opposite of the partial derivative of the specific internal energy with respect to the specific volume:
formula_59
since the internal energy in thermodynamics is a function of the two variables aforementioned, the pressure gradient contained into the momentum equation should be explicited as:
formula_60

It is convenient for brevity to switch the notation for the second order derivatives:
formula_61

Finally, the energy equation:
formula_62
can be further simplified in convective form by changing variable from specific energy to the specific entropy: in fact the first law of thermodynamics in local form can be written:
formula_63
by substituting the material derivative of the internal energy, the energy equation becomes:
formula_64
now the term between parenthesis is identically zero according to the conservation of mass, then the Euler energy equation becomes simply:
formula_65

|style = border: 1px solid lightgray; width: 90%;
|headerstyle = text-align:left;

For a thermodynamic fluid, the compressible Euler equations are consequently best written as:

{Dt} &amp;= ve_{vv}\nabla v + ve_{vs}\nabla s + \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
 {Ds \over Dt} &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #FFFF00
|background colour = #ECFCF4

where:
* formula_66 is the specific volume
* formula_1 is the flow velocity vector
* formula_68 is the specific entropy

In the general case and not only in the incompressible case, the energy equation means that for an inviscid thermodynamic fluid the specific entropy is constant along the flow lines, also in a time-dependent flow. Basing on the mass conservation equation, one can put this equation in the conservation form:
formula_69
meaning that for an inviscid nonconductive flow a continuity equation holds for the entropy.

On the other hand, the two second-order partial derivatives of the specific internal energy in the momentum equation require the specification of the fundamental equation of state of the material considered, i.e. of the specific internal energy as function of the two variables specific volume and specific entropy:
formula_70

The &quot;fundamental&quot; equation of state contains all the thermodynamic information about the system (Callen, 1985), exactly like the couple of a &quot;thermal&quot; equation of state together with a &quot;caloric&quot; equation of state.

===Conservation form===

The Euler equations in the Froude limit are equivalent to a single conservation equation with conserved quantity and associated flux respectively:
formula_71

where:
* formula_48 is the momentum density, a conservation variable.
* formula_73 is the total energy density (total energy per unit volume).

Here formula_33 has length N + 2 and formula_34 has size N(N + 2). In general (not only in the Froude limit) Euler equations are expressible as:

where formula_49 is the force density, a conservation variable.

We remark that also the Euler equation even when conservative (no external field, Froude limit) have no Riemann invariants in general. Some further assumptions are required

However, we already mentioned that for a thermodynamic fluid the equation for the total energy density is equivalent to the conservation equation:
formula_77

Then the conservation equations in the case of a thermodynamic fluid are more simply expressed as:

{\rho}\end{pmatrix} =
 \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ \mathbf{f} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #FFFF00
|background colour = #ECFCF4

where formula_78 is the entropy density, a thermodynamic conservation variable.

Another possible form for the energy equation, being particularly useful for isobarics, is:
formula_79
where formula_80 is the total enthalpy density.

==Quasilinear form and characteristic equations==
Expanding the fluxes can be an important part of constructing numerical solvers, for example by exploiting (approximate) solutions to the Riemann problem. In regions where the state vector y varies smoothly, the equations in conservative form can be put in quasilinear form:
formula_81
where formula_82 are called the flux Jacobians defined as the matrices:
formula_83

This Jacobian does not exist where the state variables are discontinuous, as at contact discontinuities or shocks.

===Characteristic equations===
The compressible Euler equations can be decoupled into a set of N+2 wave equations that describes sound in Eulerian continuum if they are expressed in characteristic variables instead of conserved variables.

In fact the tensor A is always diagonalizable. If the eigenvalues (the case of Euler equations) are all real the system is defined &quot;hyperbolic&quot;, and physically eigenvalues represent the speeds of propagation of information. If they are all distinguished, the system is defined &quot;strictly hyperbolic&quot; (it will be proved to be the case of one-dimensional Euler equations). Furthermore, diagonalisation of compressible Euler equation is easier when the energy equation is expressed in the variable entropy (i.e. with equations for thermodynamic fluids) than in other energy variables. This will become clear by considering the 1D case.

If formula_84 is the right eigenvector of the matrix formula_85 corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_86, by building the projection matrix:
formula_87

One can finally find the &quot;characteristic variables&quot; as:
formula_88

Since A is constant, multiplying the original 1-D equation in flux-Jacobian form with P−1 yields the characteristic equations:
formula_89

The original equations have been decoupled into N+2 characteristic equations each describing a simple wave, with the eigenvalues being the wave speeds. The variables &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; are called the &quot;characteristic variables&quot; and are a subset of the conservative variables. The solution of the initial value problem in terms of characteristic variables is finally very simple. In one spatial dimension it is:
formula_90

Then the solution in terms of the original conservative variables is obtained by transforming back:
formula_91
this computation can be explicited as the linear combination of the eigenvectors:
formula_92

Now it becomes apparent that the characteristic variables act as weights in the linear combination of the jacobian eigenvectors. The solution can be seen as superposition of waves, each of which is advected independently without change in shape. Each &quot;i&quot;-th wave has shape &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; and speed of propagation &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;. In the following we show a very simple example of this solution procedure.

===Waves in 1D inviscid, nonconductive thermodynamic fluid===
If one considers Euler equations for a thermodynamic fluid with the two further assumptions of one spatial dimension and free (no external field: &quot;g&quot; = 0):
formula_93

If one defines the vector of variables:
formula_94
recalling that formula_66 is the specific volume, formula_96 the flow speed, formula_68 the specific entropy, the corresponding jacobian matrix is:
formula_98

At first one must find the eigenvalues of this matrix by solving the characteristic equation:
formula_99

that is explicitly:
formula_100

This determinant is very simple: the fastest computation starts on the last row, since it has the highest number of zero elements.
formula_101

Now by computing the determinant 2×2:
formula_102
by defining the parameter:
formula_103
or equivalently in mechanical variables, as:
formula_104

This parameter is always real according to the second law of thermodynamics. In fact the second law of thermodynamics can be expressed by several postulates. The most elementary of them in mathematical terms is the statement of convexity of the fundamental equation of state, i.e. the hessian matrix of the specific energy expressed as function of specific volume and specific entropy:
formula_105
is defined positive. This statement corresponds to the two conditions:
formula_106

The first condition is the one ensuring the parameter &quot;a&quot; is defined real.

The characteristic equation finally results:
formula_107

That has three real solutions:
formula_108

Then the matrix has three real eigenvalues all distinguished: the 1D Euler equations are a &quot;strictly&quot; hyperbolic system.

At this point one should determine the three eigenvectors: each one is obtained by substituting one eigenvalue in the eigenvalue equation and then solving it. By substituting the first eigenvalue λ1 one obtains:
formula_109

Basing on the third equation that simply has solution &quot;s&quot;1=0, the system reduces to:
formula_110

The two equations are redundant as usual, then the eigenvector is defined with a multiplying constant. We choose as right eigenvector:
formula_111

The other two eigenvectors can be found with analogous procedure as:
formula_112

Then the projection matrix can be built:
formula_113

Finally it becomes apparent that the real parameter &quot;a&quot; previously defined is the speed of propagation of the information characteristic of the hyperbolic system made of Euler equations, i.e. it is the &quot;wave speed&quot;. It remains to be shown that the sound speed corresponds to the particular case of an isentropic transformation:
formula_114

===Compressibility and sound speed===
Sound speed is defined as the wavespeed of an isentropic transformation:
formula_115
by the definition of the isoentropic compressibility:
formula_116
the soundspeed results always the square root of ratio between the isentropic compressibility and the density:
formula_117

====Ideal gas====
The sound speed in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature:
formula_118

Since the specific enthalpy in an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature:

formula_119

the sound speed in an ideal gas can also be made dependent only on its specific enthalpy:

formula_120

==Bernoulli&#x27;s theorem for steady inviscid flow==
Bernoulli&#x27;s theorem is a direct consequence of the Euler equations.

===Incompressible case and Lamb&#x27;s form===

The vector calculus identity of the cross product of a curl holds:

formula_121

where the Feynman subscript notation formula_122 is used, which means the subscripted gradient operates only on the factor formula_34.

Lamb in his famous classical book Hydrodynamics (1895), still in print, used this identity to change the convective term of the flow velocity in rotational form:

formula_124

the Euler momentum equation in Lamb&#x27;s form becomes:

formula_125

Now, basing on the other identity:

formula_126

the Euler momentum equation assumes a form that is optimal to demonstrate Bernoulli&#x27;s theorem for steady flows:

formula_127

In fact, in case of an external conservative field, by defining its potential φ:

formula_128

In case of a steady flow the time derivative of the flow velocity disappears, so the momentum equation becomes:

formula_129

And by projecting the momentum equation on the flow direction, i.e. along a &quot;streamline&quot;, the cross product disappears because its result is always perpendicular to the velocity:

formula_130

In the steady incompressible case the mass equation is simply:

formula_131that is the mass conservation for a steady incompressible flow states that the density along a streamline is constant. Then the Euler momentum equation in the steady incompressible case becomes:

formula_132

The convenience of defining the total head for an inviscid liquid flow is now apparent:

formula_133

which may be simply written as:

formula_134

That is, the momentum balance for a steady inviscid and incompressible flow in an external conservative field states that the total head along a streamline is constant.

===Compressible case ===
In the most general steady (compressible) case the mass equation in conservation form is:

formula_135Therefore, the previous expression is rather

formula_136

The right-hand side appears on the energy equation in convective form, which on the steady state reads:

formula_137

The energy equation therefore becomes:

formula_138

so that the internal specific energy now features in the head.

Since the external field potential is usually small compared to the other terms, it is convenient to group the latter ones in the total enthalpy:

formula_139

and the Bernoulli invariant for an inviscid gas flow is:

formula_140

which can be written as:

formula_141

That is, the energy balance for a steady inviscid flow in an external conservative field states that the sum of the total enthalpy and the external potential is constant along a streamline.

In the usual case of small potential field, simply:

formula_142

===Friedmann form and Crocco form===

By substituting the pressure gradient with the entropy and enthalpy gradient, according to the first law of thermodynamics in the enthalpy form:

formula_143

in the convective form of Euler momentum equation, one arrives to:

formula_144

Friedmann deduced this equation for the particular case of a perfect gas and published it in 1922. However, this equation is general for an inviscid nonconductive fluid and no equation of state is implicit in it.

On the other hand, by substituting the enthalpy form of the first law of thermodynamics in the rotational form of Euler momentum equation, one obtains:

formula_145

and by defining the specific total enthalpy:

formula_146

one arrives to the Crocco–Vazsonyi form (Crocco, 1937) of the Euler momentum equation:

formula_147

In the steady case the two variables entropy and total enthalpy are particularly useful since Euler equations can be recast into the Crocco&#x27;s form:

formula_148

Finally if the flow is also isothermal:

formula_149

by defining the specific total Gibbs free energy:

formula_150

the Crocco&#x27;s form can be reduced to:

formula_151

From these relationships one deduces that the specific total free energy is uniform in a steady, irrotational, isothermal, isoentropic, inviscid flow.

==Discontinuities==

The Euler equations are quasilinear hyperbolic equations and their general solutions are waves. Under certain assumptions they can be simplified leading to Burgers equation. Much like the familiar oceanic waves, waves described by the Euler Equations &#x27;break&#x27; and so-called shock waves are formed; this is a nonlinear effect and represents the solution becoming multi-valued. Physically this represents a breakdown of the assumptions that led to the formulation of the differential equations, and to extract further information from the equations we must go back to the more fundamental integral form. Then, weak solutions are formulated by working in &#x27;jumps&#x27; (discontinuities) into the flow quantities – density, velocity, pressure, entropy – using the Rankine–Hugoniot equations. Physical quantities are rarely discontinuous; in real flows, these discontinuities are smoothed out by viscosity and by heat transfer. (See Navier–Stokes equations)

Shock propagation is studied – among many other fields – in aerodynamics and rocket propulsion, where sufficiently fast flows occur.

To properly compute the continuum quantities in discontinuous zones (for example shock waves or boundary layers) from the &quot;local&quot; forms (all the above forms are local forms, since the variables being described are typical of one point in the space considered, i.e. they are &quot;local variables&quot;) of Euler equations through finite difference methods generally too many space points and time steps would be necessary for the memory of computers now and in the near future. In these cases it is mandatory to avoid the local forms of the conservation equations, passing some weak forms, like the finite volume one.

===Rankine–Hugoniot equations===

Starting from the simplest case, one consider a steady free conservation equation in conservation form in the space domain:

formula_152

where in general F is the flux matrix. By integrating this local equation over a fixed volume Vm, it becomes:

formula_153

Then, basing on the divergence theorem, we can transform this integral in a boundary integral of the flux:

formula_154

This &quot;global form&quot; simply states that there is no net flux of a conserved quantity passing through a region in the case steady and without source. In 1D the volume reduces to an interval, its boundary being its extrema, then the divergence theorem reduces to the fundamental theorem of calculus:

formula_155

that is the simple finite difference equation, known as the &quot;jump relation&quot;:

formula_156

That can be made explicit as:

formula_157

where the notation employed is:

formula_158

Or, if one performs an indefinite integral:

formula_159

On the other hand, a transient conservation equation:

formula_160

brings to a jump relation:

formula_161

For one-dimensional Euler equations the conservation variables and the flux are the vectors:

formula_162
formula_163

where:
* formula_66 is the specific volume,
* formula_23 is the mass flux.

In the one dimensional case the correspondent jump relations, called the Rankine–Hugoniot equations, are:&lt;

formula_166

In the steady one dimensional case the become simply:

formula_167

Thanks to the mass difference equation, the energy difference equation can be simplified without any restriction:

formula_168

where formula_169 is the specific total enthalpy.

These are the usually expressed in the convective variables:

formula_170

where:
* formula_96 is the flow speed
* formula_50 is the specific internal energy.

The energy equation is an integral form of the Bernoulli equation in the compressible case. 
The former mass and momentum equations by substitution lead to the Rayleigh equation:

formula_173

Since the second term is a constant, the Rayleigh equation always describes a simple line in the pressure volume plane not dependent of any equation of state, i.e. the Rayleigh line. By substitution in the Rankine–Hugoniot equations, that can be also made explicit as:

formula_174

One can also obtain the kinetic equation and to the Hugoniot equation. The analytical passages are not shown here for brevity.

These are respectively:

formula_175

The Hugoniot equation, coupled with the fundamental equation of state of the material:

formula_176

describes in general in the pressure volume plane a curve passing by the conditions (v0, p0), i.e. the Hugoniot curve, whose shape strongly depends on the type of material considered.

It is also customary to define a &quot;Hugoniot function&quot;:

formula_177

allowing to quantify deviations from the Hugoniot equation, similarly to the previous definition of the &quot;hydraulic head&quot;, useful for the deviations from the Bernoulli equation.

===Finite volume form===

On the other hand, by integrating a generic conservation equation:

formula_178

on a fixed volume &quot;Vm&quot;, and then basing on the divergence theorem, it becomes:

formula_179

By integrating this equation also over a time interval:

formula_180

Now by defining the node conserved quantity:

formula_181

we deduce the finite volume form:

formula_182

In particular, for Euler equations, once the conserved quantities have been determined, the convective variables are deduced by back substitution:

formula_183

Then the explicit finite volume expressions of the original convective variables are:

\oint_{\partial V_m}\rho\mathbf{u} \cdot \hat{n}\, ds\, dt \\[1.2ex]
 \mathbf u_{m,n+1} &amp;= \mathbf u_{m,n} - \frac{1}{\rho_{m,n} V_m}\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}\oint_{\partial V_m} (\rho\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u} - p\mathbf{I}) \cdot \hat{n}\, ds\, dt \\[1.2ex]
 \mathbf e_{m,n+1} &amp;= \mathbf e_{m,n} - \frac{1}{2}\left(u^2_{m,n+1} - u^2_{m,n}\right) - \frac{1}{\rho_{m,n} V_m}\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}\oint_{\partial V_m} \left(\rho e + \frac{1}{2}\rho u^2 + p\right)\mathbf{u} \cdot \hat{n}\, ds\, dt \\[1.2ex]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Constraints==
It has been shown that Euler equations are not a complete set of equations, but they require some additional constraints to admit a unique solution: these are the equation of state of the material considered. To be consistent with thermodynamics these equations of state should satisfy the two laws of thermodynamics. On the other hand, by definition non-equilibrium system are described by laws lying outside these laws. In the following we list some very simple equations of state and the corresponding influence on Euler equations.

===Ideal polytropic gas===

For an ideal polytropic gas the fundamental equation of state is:

formula_184

where formula_50 is the specific energy, formula_66 is the specific volume, formula_68 is the specific entropy, formula_188 is the molecular mass, formula_189 here is considered a constant (polytropic process), and can be shown to correspond to the heat capacity ratio. This equation can be shown to be consistent with the usual equations of state employed by thermodynamics.

From this equation one can derive the equation for pressure by its thermodynamic definition:

formula_190

By inverting it one arrives to the mechanical equation of state:

formula_191

Then for an ideal gas the compressible Euler equations can be simply expressed in the &quot;mechanical&quot; or &quot;primitive variables&quot; specific volume, flow velocity and pressure, by taking the set of the equations for a thermodynamic system and modifying the energy equation into a pressure equation through this mechanical equation of state. At last, in convective form they result:

{Dt} &amp;= v\nabla p + \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
 {Dp \over Dt} &amp;= -\gamma p\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #FF00FF
|background colour = #ECFCF4

and in one-dimensional quasilinear form they results:

formula_192

where the conservative vector variable is:

formula_193

and the corresponding jacobian matrix is:

formula_194

=== Steady flow in material coordinates ===
In the case of steady flow, it is convenient to choose the Frenet–Serret frame along a streamline as the coordinate system for describing the steady momentum Euler equation:
formula_195

where formula_1, formula_12 and formula_37 denote the flow velocity, the pressure and the density, respectively.

Let formula_199 be a Frenet–Serret orthonormal basis which consists of a tangential unit vector, a normal unit vector, and a binormal unit vector to the streamline, respectively. Since a streamline is a curve that is tangent to the velocity vector of the flow, the left-hand side of the above equation, the convective derivative of velocity, can be described as follows:
formula_200
where 
formula_201
and formula_202 is the radius of curvature of the streamline.

Therefore, the momentum part of the Euler equations for a steady flow is found to have a simple form:
formula_203

For barotropic flow formula_204, Bernoulli&#x27;s equation is derived from the first equation:
formula_205

The second equation expresses that, in the case the streamline is curved, there should exist a pressure gradient normal to the streamline because the centripetal acceleration of the fluid parcel is only generated by the normal pressure gradient.

The third equation expresses that pressure is constant along the binormal axis.

==== Streamline curvature theorem ====
Let formula_206 be the distance from the center of curvature of the streamline, then the second equation is written as follows:
formula_207

where formula_208

This equation states:
&quot;In a steady flow of an inviscid fluid without external forces, the center of curvature of the streamline lies in the direction of decreasing radial pressure.&quot;
Although this relationship between the pressure field and flow curvature is very useful, it doesn&#x27;t have a name in the English-language scientific literature. Japanese fluid-dynamicists call the relationship the &quot;Streamline curvature theorem&quot;.

This &quot;theorem&quot; explains clearly why there are such low pressures in the centre of vortices, which consist of concentric circles of streamlines.
This also is a way to intuitively explain why airfoils generate lift forces.

==Exact solutions==
All potential flow solutions are also solutions of the Euler equations, and in particular the incompressible Euler equations when the potential is harmonic.
Solutions to the Euler equations with vorticity are:
* parallel shear flows – where the flow is unidirectional, and the flow velocity only varies in the cross-flow directions, e.g. in a Cartesian coordinate system formula_209 the flow is for instance in the formula_35-direction – with the only non-zero velocity component being formula_211 only dependent on formula_212 and formula_213 and not on formula_214
* Arnold–Beltrami–Childress flow – an exact solution of the incompressible Euler equations.
* Two solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations with cylindrical symmetry have been presented by Gibbon, Moore and Stuart in 2003. These two solutions have infinite energy; they blow up everywhere in space in finite time.

<text>The cowbell is an idiophone hand percussion instrument used in various styles of music, such as Latin and rock. It is named after the similar bell used by herdsmen to keep track of the whereabouts of cows. The instrument initially and traditionally has been metallic; however, contemporarily, some variants are made of synthetic materials.

== Origins ==
While the cowbell is commonly found in musical contexts, its origin can be traced to freely roaming animals. In order to help identify the herd to which these animals belonged, herdsmen placed these bells around the animal&#x27;s neck. As the animals moved about the bell would ring, thus making it easier to know of the animal&#x27;s whereabouts. Though the bells were used on various types of animals, they are typically referred to as &quot;cowbells&quot; due to their extensive use with cattle.

==Tuned cowbells==

Tuned cowbells or Almglocken (their German name, ‘Alm’ meaning a mountain meadow, and ‘Glocken’ bells), sometimes known by the English translation alpine bells (also &quot;Alpenglocken&quot; in German), typically refer to bulbous brass bells that are used to play music, sometimes as a novelty act or tourist attraction in the northern Alps, and sometimes in classical music, as in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Alpine Symphony&quot;. Since they are tuned differently, in order to distinguish individual animals, they can be collected &quot;from the pasture&quot; in random tunings, but commercial sets in equal temperament are also available. The metal clapper is retained, and they sound much noisier than handbells, which are otherwise used similarly in ensembles.

Composers who included &quot;Almglocken&quot; among their musical palette include Tōru Takemitsu, Jo Kondo, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Roy Harter, John Adams, Thomas Ades, Joseph Schwantner, and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Olivier Messiaen used multiple chromatic sets of clapperless cowbells in several of his compositions, notably &quot;Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum&quot; and &quot;Couleurs de la cité celeste&quot;.

== Clapperless cowbells ==
&quot;Clapperless cowbells&quot; made of metal are an important element in Latin-American and go-go music. These cowbells are struck with a stick – the tone being modulated by striking different parts of the bell and by damping with the hand holding the bell.

In several parts of the world (notably in West Africa) pairs or trios of clapperless bells are joined in such a way that they can be struck separately or clashed together. The Brazilian name for these is &quot;agogo&quot; bells. Cylindrical wood blocks played in the same way are also called &quot;Agogô&quot;. In Cuban music the cowbell is called &quot;cencerro&quot; and often played by the same player as the bongos. In Caribbean music two or three are often mounted together with a pair of timbales.

This type of cowbell can also be played with the foot using a modified bass drum pedal or bowed with a double bass bow.

== Sports use ==
Cowbells are sometimes popular noisemakers at sporting events, despite attempts to suppress them. While different sports teams seem to have their own story explaining the use of cowbells at their games, it is unlikely that so many teams across varying levels of sports and geographical regions would not have a common cultural reason for the practice. Although the origin of cowbell noisemakers is unclear, the most plausible explanation has to do with early baseball. Baseball games in the 19th century were often played in cow pastures, as American society was agrarian-based at the time. Cowbells were easily found or taken from around the necks of cows in the pasture and were utilized as noisemakers. The tradition naturally grew to be common practice at various sporting events, not just baseball. In the United States, they are most closely identified with Mississippi State University, whose football fans once smuggled in cowbells by the thousands despite a ban on artificial noisemakers by its conference, the Southeastern Conference. SEC guidelines were changed in 2010 to permit limited cowbell use at Mississippi State football games, and again in 2014 to permit cowbells to be freely rung at any time except between the time that the offensive center is over the football until the play is whistled dead. Elsewhere in college football, the cowbell can be found at Penn State and Michigan football games, where it is played with a particular rhythm and accompanying chant.

Worldwide, in cross-country skiing, cowbells are often rung vigorously at the start and finishes of races, to cheer on the racers. They are used by cyclocross fans in much the same way.

Cornell ice hockey fans who are also known for their zealous support of their team have cheers that feature use of a cowbell while in Lynah Rink. The San Jose SaberCats of the Arena Football League are also infamous for their fans&#x27; use of cowbells. In New Zealand, supporters of the Waikato Rugby Union invariably use cowbells at home matches; this has been carried over to home matches of the Chiefs, the Super Rugby franchise centered on the Waikato region. During University of New Hampshire ice hockey games, a small group of fans at the base of the student section show their support for the UNH Wildcats with a cowbell. This group also leads the chants and shows their support with posters and other props. Finally the 2006–2007 American Basketball Association (ABA) champion Vermont Frost Heaves have a large cowbell following at their home games.

A small number of Toronto Blue Jays fans at Rogers Centre frequently bring cowbells to Blue Jays home games. They are common enough at Tampa Bay Rays home games that the stadium scoreboard graphics crew have a pre-built graphic that says &quot;More Cowbell!!&quot;. The Everett Silvertips fans also use cowbells, after the team watched the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit while on their tour bus in their inaugural season, and said they wanted the fans to have cowbells. They have a &quot;more cowbell&quot; that sometimes shows on the jumbotron. The Belleville Bulls in the Ontario Hockey League used the skit on their video scoreboard and &quot;More Cowbell&quot; as a catchphrase during the 2007 playoffs. Their goalie Edward Pasquale has several Will Ferrell characters painted on his goalie mask, including the one from the Saturday Night Live skit with the cowbell and others.

Fans of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Sacramento Kings began bringing cowbells to the team&#x27;s games at ARCO Arena after Los Angeles Lakers head coach Phil Jackson referred to Sacramento as a &quot;cow town&quot; with &quot;semi-civilized&quot; fans during the 2002 Western Conference Finals.

The cowbell has become a tradition for the Melbourne Storm fans in the NRL and is rung by a group of 3 people in the active supporter bay behind the goals at AAMI Park, as well as a few other people around the ground.

The supporters of Huddersfield Giants also have a small, enthusiastic group of fans known as &quot;the cowbell army&quot; who try and create a fun and friendly atmosphere at home and away games in the Super League.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;More cowbell&quot; is an American catchphrase spoken as a humorous recommendation for improving a music performance. The phrase originated from Christopher Walken saying it in a comedy sketch that aired on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on April 8, 2000.

<doc id="396028" wikidata="Q192428" url="?curid=396028" title="Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire">
<text>Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (; 15 April 177219 June 1844) was a French naturalist who established the principle of &quot;unity of composition&quot;. He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and expanded and defended Lamarck&#x27;s evolutionary theories. Geoffroy&#x27;s scientific views had a transcendental flavor (unlike Lamarck&#x27;s materialistic views) and were similar to those of German morphologists like Lorenz Oken. He believed in the underlying unity of organismal design, and the possibility of the transmutation of species in time, amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy, paleontology, and embryology. He is considered as a predecessor of the evo-devo evolutionary concept.

==Life and early career==
Geoffroy was born at Étampes (in present-day Essonne), and studied at the Collège de Navarre, in Paris, where he studied natural philosophy under M. J. Brisson. He then attended the lectures of Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton at the College de France and Fourcroy at the Jardin des Plantes. In March 1793 Daubenton, through the interest of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, procured him the office of sub-keeper and assistant demonstrator of the cabinet of natural history, made vacant by the resignation of Bernard Germain Étienne de la Ville, Comte de Lacépède. By a law passed in June 1793, Geoffroy was appointed one of the twelve professors of the newly constituted Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle, being assigned the chair of zoology. In the same year he busied himself with the formation of a menagerie at that institution.

In 1794, Geoffroy entered into correspondence with Georges Cuvier. Shortly after the appointment of Cuvier as assistant at the Museum d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle, Geoffroy received him into his house. The two friends wrote together five memoirs on natural history, one of which, on the classification of mammals, puts forward the idea of the subordination of characters upon which Cuvier based his zoological system. It was in a paper entitled &quot;Histoire des Makis, ou singes de Madagascar&quot;, written in 1795, that Geoffroy first gave expression to his views on the unity of organic composition, the influence of which is perceptible in all his subsequent writings; nature, he observes, presents us with only one plan of construction, the same in principle, but varied in its accessory parts.

In 1798, Geoffroy was chosen a member of Napoleon&#x27;s great scientific expedition to Egypt as part of the natural history and physics section of the Institut d&#x27;Égypte; 151 scientists and artists participated in the expedition, including Dominique-Vivant Denon, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier. On the capitulation of Alexandria in August 1801, he took part in resisting the claim made by the British general to the collections of the expedition, declaring that, were that demand persisted in, history would have to record that he also had burnt a library in Alexandria. Early in January 1802 Geoffroy returned to Paris. He was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences in September 1807. In March of the following year Napoleon, who had already recognized his national services by the award of the cross of the legion of honor, selected him to visit the museums of Portugal, for the purpose of procuring collections from them, and in the face of considerable opposition from the British he eventually was successful in retaining them as a permanent possession for his country.

==Later career==
In 1809, the year after his return to France, Geoffroy was made professor of zoology at the faculty of sciences at Paris, and from that period he devoted himself more exclusively than before to anatomical study. In 1818 he published the first part of his celebrated &quot;Philosophie anatomique&quot;, the second volume of which, published in 1822, and subsequent memoirs account for the formation of monstrosities on the principle of arrest of development, and of the attraction of similar parts.

Geoffroy&#x27;s friend Robert Edmund Grant shared his views on unity of plan and corresponded with him while working on marine invertebrates in the late 1820s in Edinburgh (assisted in 1826 and 1827 by his student Charles Darwin) when Grant successfully identified the pancreas in molluscs. When, in 1830, Geoffroy proceeded to apply to the &quot;invertebrata&quot; his views as to the unity of animal composition, he found a vigorous opponent in Cuvier, his former friend.

Geoffroy, a synthesiser, contended, in accordance with his theory of unity of plan in organic composition, that all animals are formed of the same elements, in the same number; and with the same connections: homologous parts, however they differ in form and size, must remain associated in the same invariable order. With Johann Wolfgang von Goethe he held that there is in nature a law of compensation or balancing of growth, so that if one organ take on an excess of development, it is at the expense of some other part; and he maintained that, since nature takes no sudden leaps, even organs which are superfluous in any given species, if they have played an important part in other species of the same family, are retained as rudiments, which testify to the permanence of the general plan of creation. It was his conviction that, owing to the conditions of life, the same forms had not been perpetuated since the origin of all things, although it was not his belief that existing species are becoming modified.

Cuvier, who was an analytical observer of facts, admitted only the prevalence of laws of co-existence or harmony in animal organs, and maintained the absolute invariability of species, which he declared had been created with a regard to the circumstances in which they were placed, each organ contrived with a view to the function it had to fulfil, thus putting, in Geoffroy&#x27;s considerations, the effect for the cause.

In 1836 he coined the term phocomelia. In 1838 he was named an Officer of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

In July 1840, Geoffroy became blind, and some months later he had a paralytic attack. From that time his strength gradually failed him. He resigned his chair at the museum in 1841, and was succeeded by his son, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. He died in Paris on 19 June 1844 and is buried in Division 19 of the Cimetière du Père Lachaise.

==Geoffroy&#x27;s theory==
Geoffroy was a deist, which is to say that he believed in a God, but also in a law-like universe, with no supernatural interference in the details of existence. This kind of opinion was common in the Enlightenment, and goes with a rejection of revelation and miracles, and does not interpret the Bible as the literal word of God. These views did not conflict with his naturalistic ideas about organic change.

Geoffroy&#x27;s theory was not a theory of common descent, but a working-out of existing potential in a given type. For him, the environment causes a direct induction of organic change. This opinion Ernst Mayr labels as &#x27;Geoffroyism&#x27;. It is definitely not what Lamarck believed (for Lamarck, a change in &quot;habits&quot; is what changes the animal). The direct effect of environment on heritable traits is not believed today to be a central evolutionary force; even Lawrence knew by 1816 that the climate does not directly cause the major differences between human races.

Geoffroy endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that &quot;monstrosities could become the founding fathers (or mothers) of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to the next.&quot; In 1831 he speculated that birds could have arisen from reptiles by an epigenetic saltation. Geoffroy wrote that environmental pressures could produce sudden transformations to establish new species instantaneously. In 1864 Albert von Kölliker revived Geoffroy&#x27;s theory that evolution proceeds by large steps, under the name of heterogenesis.

Geoffroy noted that the organization of dorsal and ventral structures in arthropods is opposite that of mammals. The inversion hypothesis was met with criticism and was rejected, however, some modern molecular embryologists have since resurrected this idea.

==Legacy==
The Geoffroy&#x27;s cat (&quot;Leopardus geoffroyi)&quot; was named in his honour.

Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of South American turtle, &quot;Phrynops geoffroanus&quot;.

His name is also honoured in that of a number of other species, including Geoffroy&#x27;s spider monkey, Geoffroy&#x27;s bat, and Geoffroy&#x27;s tamarin.

The Catfish &quot;Corydoras geoffroy&quot; is named after him.

 is a street in the 5ème arrondissement, Paris near the Jardin des Plantes and Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle.

==In popular culture==
French author Honoré de Balzac dedicated his novel &quot;Le Père Goriot&quot; to Saint-Hilaire, &quot;as a tribute of admiration for his labors and his genius.&quot;

<text>Oakworth Hall is located in Oakworth, West Yorkshire, England. The manor house was rebuilt in the 17th century, but has a history dating back to 1066. The building overlooks the Worth Valley, facing south towards Haworth.




Nearby is Holden Park, which was the site of Oakworth House and its grounds, once owned by Sir Isaac Holden, an inventor who is said to have invented the lucifer match and revolutionised the process of carding wool. He also owned Oakworth Hall.
==External features==
The Hall is located on the corner of Providence Lane, which once ran through the Hall&#x27;s farmyard. The cornerstone on the north rear wall, above the door of the farm cottage, is one of four found in the district commissioned by John Craven in July 1843.

Of important historical interest is a carved stone panel of a mounted huntsman of either Celtic origins or Romano-British of the first centuries CE. Accompanying the huntsman there are three small animals which might be taken to be dogs, but in the &quot;History of Keighley&quot; they are described as &quot;three goats trippant&quot;. A goat is featured on the coat of arms on one branch of the Copley family who were early residents of the Hall. The panel may be even earlier, perhaps pre-Roman Iron Age. Two crude heads, which are thought to be of the same period, flank the carving.

The lintel above the door on the north side of the farm cottage is a curiously carved stone with triple rounded arches and double spiral decorative motifs. Both this stone and the panel came from the surrounding moors and it is believed they were incorporated into the building for good luck.



==Internal features==

All the original fireplaces have been preserved. There is a large inglenook fireplace, ten feet across, in the dining room. Next to the fireplace is a salt cellar. Salt was very important for the preservation of food and had to be stored in the driest place in the building. Stored in the salt cellar today is a pair of very small, leather, children&#x27;s shoes which were discovered during restoration work on a chimney. Shoes were traditionally secreted away in the Middle Ages to ward off evil spirits and to bring good fortune to the residents of the Hall. Two oak beams in the dining room are 18 inches by 10 feet and actually extend throughout the Hall. The original adze marks are clearly in evidence.

In the kitchen there is an old oven. It has a cast iron interior and is surrounded by large stones. It is reputed to be the oldest oven in Yorkshire that is still capable of use. From the kitchen, steps lead down to a cellar. On the first floor, two of the six bedrooms have arched gothic style windows to provide light on the landing. The windows have stone mullions. All the doors are constructed of solid English oak and the handsome front door dates from when that part of the building was rebuilt in 1702.

In the study there is an original fireplace and cast iron stove. This is almost identical to the one in the later-built Brontë Parsonage Museum in nearby Haworth.

The Hall (now numbers 69 and 71 Colne road) is a Grade II listed building and is subject to a Preservation Order.

==The History of the Hall==

*1066 - Mentioned in the Domesday Book as the Manor of Oakworth. It was given by William the Conqueror to Gilbert Tyson.
*1366 - Property of the de Vaux family who were probably descendants of the Tyson family. The de Vaux families&#x27; main seat was Vauxhall (Vaux Hall, in south east London). They had large properties in northern England from South Yorkshire up to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Thomas de Vaux was Chancellor of Richard I during the earlier Crusades to the Holy Land.
*1598 - Alvery Copley, the last member of the de Vaux family, died and the 32 tenants who farmed the lands were constituted Lords of Oakworth Manor. It is believed that the first building which stood on the site was built by the de Vaux family.
*1662 - The famous Baptist Minister John Moore was born at Oakworth Hall. He was a friend and close colleague of William Mitchell who was imprisoned for preaching in 1687. Together they clandestinely crisscrossed the Pennines visiting various safe houses in both Lancashire and West Yorkshire. It is thought that the previous building of Oakworth Hall was one of those &quot;safe houses&quot;. It is advanced that the destruction of the previous building of Oakworth Hall was as a result of the turbulent period of religious persecution. It is also suggested that the old building was burned down to smoke out a &quot;priest hole&quot; that had existed beneath the Hall since the Reformation.
*1691 - Oakworth Hall is mentioned in the Keighley Rolls in the entry for 12 December 1691. Some travellers visited the Squire, Anthony Moore, at Oakworth Hall.
*1702 - The rebuilding of the Hall was probably completed by William Clough in its present form. The date 1702 is over the door on the south side of the Farm Cottage.
*1708 - William Clough of Oakworth Hall is mentioned in the Haworth Court Rolls.
*1715 - Jamas Haggas of Oakworth Hall bound as an apprentice to a Halifax weaver. Later, he bought long wool in Lincolnshire and sorted wool with his son at Oakworth Hall. These documents are in the deeds of the Hall. The Hall is mentioned in Heaton&#x27;s &quot;Yorkshire Woollen and Worsted Industries&quot;.
*1883 - Sold by the descendants of the Haggas family, (Blamire and Craven) to Richard Longdon Hattersly.
*1913 - Trustees of the Hattersly family sold the Hall to Benjamin, William and John Speight who were plumbers.

: (The families Clough, Haggas and Hattersly all became large textile manufacturers in the spinning and weaving industries in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The Cloughs became mohair spinners and weavers and the firm still exists today as British Mohair Spinners. Haggas became the largest worsted spinners in the area and there is still a large manufacturing plant in Keighley. The Hattersleys owned a number of worsted and woollen Mills and factories producing textile and weaving booms. There is still today Hattersley Narrow Fabrics Mill in Keighley.)

*1936 - The Speight family sold the Hall to the Yorkshire Penny Bank.
*1945 - When the Bank closed its Oakworth branch the Hall was bought by the Assistant Manager of the bank. It became a private residence once again. It changed hands a number of times and was a guest house from 1979–2002.
*2003 - The Hall is now a private residence.

<doc id="396035" wikidata="Q381238" url="?curid=396035" title="Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz">
<text>Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (; 24 February 188518 September 1939), commonly known as Witkacy, was a Polish writer, painter, philosopher, theorist, playwright, novelist, and photographer active before World War I and during the interwar period.

==Life==
Born in Warsaw, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz was a son of the painter, architect and an art critic Stanisław Witkiewicz. His mother was Maria Pietrzkiewicz Witkiewiczowa. Both of his parents were born in the Samogitian region of Lithuania. His godmother was the internationally famous actress Helena Modrzejewska.

Witkiewicz was reared at the family home in Zakopane. In accordance with his father&#x27;s antipathy to the &quot;servitude of the school,&quot; he was home-schooled and encouraged to develop his talents across a range of creative fields. Against his father&#x27;s wishes he studied at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts with Józef Mehoffer and Jan Stanisławski.

Witkiewicz was close friends with composer Karol Szymanowski and, from childhood, with Bronisław Malinowski and Zofia Romer. Romer was romantically linked to both Bronisław Malinowski and Witkiewicz. He had a tumultuous affair with prominent actress Irena Solska who according to is represented as the heroine Akne Montecalfi in his first novel, &quot;The 622 Downfalls of Bungo or The Demonic Woman&quot;, 1911. According to Micińska he also represented himself as the character Bungo and Malinowski as the Duke of Nevermore. The unfinished novel, which was not published until 1972, also describes erotic encounters between Bungo and the Duke of Nevermore. Taught wet plate photography by his father, it was during this period that he also began producing the intimate portrait photography for which he is known; producing striking portraits of his circle in Zakopane and many self-portraits.

In 1914 following a crisis in Witkiewicz&#x27;s personal life due to the suicide of his fiancée Jadwiga Janczewska, for which he blamed himself, he was invited by Malinowski to act as draftsman and photographer on his anthropological expedition to the then Territory of Papua, by way of Ceylon and Australia. The venture was interrupted by the onset of World War I. After quarrelling with Malinowski in Australia, Witkiewicz who was by birth a subject of the Russian Empire, travelled to St Petersburg (then Petrograd) from Sydney and was commissioned as an officer in the Pavlovsky Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. His ailing father, a Polish patriot, was deeply grieved by his son&#x27;s decision and died in 1915 without seeing him again.

In July 1916 he was seriously wounded in the battle on Stokhid River in what is now Ukraine and was evacuated to St Petersburg where he witnessed the Russian Revolution. He claimed that he worked out his philosophical principles during an artillery barrage, and that when the Revolution broke out he was elected political commissar of his regiment. His later works would show his fear of social revolution and foreign invasion, often couched in absurdist language.
He had begun to support himself through portrait painting and continued to do so on his return to Zakopane in Poland. He soon entered into a major creative phase, setting out his principles in &quot;New Forms in Painting&quot; and &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Pure Form in the Theatre&quot;. He associated with a group of &quot;formist&quot; artists in the early 1920s and wrote most of his plays during this period. Of about forty plays written by Witkiewicz between 1918 and 1925, twenty-one survive, and only &quot;Jan Maciej Karol Hellcat&quot; met with any public success during the author&#x27;s lifetime. The original Polish manuscript of &quot;The Crazy Locomotive&quot; was also lost; the play, back-translated from two French versions, was not published until 1962.
After 1925, and taking the name &#x27;Witkacy&#x27;, the artist ironically re-branded his portrait painting which provided his economic sustenance as &quot;The S.I. Witkiewicz Portrait Painting Company&quot;, with the tongue in cheek motto: &quot;The customer must always be satisfied&quot;. Several of the so-called grades of portraits were offered, from the merely representational to the more expressionistic and the narcotics-assisted. Many of his paintings were annotated with mnemonics listing the drugs taken while painting a particular painting, even if this happened to be only a cup of coffee. He also varied the spelling of his name, signing himself &quot;Witkac, Witkatze, Witkacjusz, Vitkacius&quot; and &quot;Vitecasse&quot; — the last being French for &quot;breaks quickly&quot;.

In the late 1920s he turned to novel-writing, writing two works, &quot;Farewell to Autumn&quot; and &quot;Insatiability&quot;. The latter, his major work, encompasses geopolitics, psychoactive drugs, and philosophy. In 1935 he was awarded the Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature for his novels.

During the 1930s, Witkiewicz published a text on his experiences of narcotics, including peyote, and pursued his interests in philosophy writing, &quot;Concepts and Principles Implied by the Concept of Existence&quot; 1935. In 1934 he finishes perhaps his most famous literary work, the drama Szewcy, finally published in 1948. He also promoted emerging writers such as Bruno Schulz.

==Death==
Shortly after Poland was invaded by Germany in September 1939, Witkiewicz escaped with his young lover Czesława Oknińska to the rural frontier town of Jeziory, in what was then eastern Poland. After hearing the news of the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Witkacy committed suicide on 18 September by taking a drug overdose and trying to slit his wrists. He convinced Czesława to attempt suicide with him by consuming Luminal, but she survived. The film &quot;Mystification&quot; (2010), written and directed by Jacek Koprowicz proposes, in surrealist fashion, that Witkiewicz faked his own death and lived secretly in Poland until 1968.

==Legacy==
Witkiewicz had died in some obscurity but his reputation began to rise soon after the war, which had destroyed his life and devastated Poland. Outside of Poland his work was discussed as a precursor to post-WWII European drama in Martin Esslin&#x27;s influential &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot; 1961, and later in &quot;Postdramatisches Theater&quot; 1999 (&quot;Postdramatic Theatre&quot; 2006). Konstanty Puzyna collected his surviving dramatic writings in two volumes in &quot;Dramaty&quot; (Dramas) 1962 which revived interest in his plays in Poland. Through his translations and scholarship, Daniel Gerould introduced English-language audiences to the writings of Witkiewicz.

Czesław Miłosz framed his argument in &quot;The Captive Mind&quot; around a discussion of Witkiewicz&#x27;s novel, &quot;Insatiability&quot;. The artist and theater director Tadeusz Kantor was inspired by the &quot;Cricot&quot; group, through which Witkiewicz had presented his final plays in Kraków. Kantor brought many of the plays back into currency, first in Poland and then internationally, including &quot;The Cuttlefish&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Water Hen&quot; (1969). Visual artist Paulina Olowska produced Witkiewicz&#x27;s &quot;The Mother: An Unsavoury Play in Two Acts and an Epilogue&quot; at the Tate Modern in 2015.

Films which have Witkiewicz as the subject include &quot;Tumor Witkacego&quot; 1985, &quot;Mystification&quot; 2010 and &quot;Witkacy and Malinowski: a cinematic séance in 23 scenes&quot; 2018. Films based on his works include &quot;Ludiot i kalugericata&quot; 1968,&quot;Farewell to Autumn&quot; 1990, &quot;Insatiability&quot; 2003,&quot;Madame Tutli-Putli&quot; 2007 and &quot;Nursery Rhyme of a Madman&quot; 2017.

Witkiewicz&#x27;s paintings and pastel drawings are in the collections of the National Museum, Warsaw, the National Museum, Kraków, Museum of Literature, Warsaw and the Museum of Central Pomerania with 125 works in Słupsk Castle. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney hold important examples of his photography. The Villa Oksza Gallery of 20th century art of the Tatra Museum in Zakopane holds important examples of his photography and pastel drawings.

In the postwar period, People&#x27;s Republic of Poland&#x27;s Ministry of Culture decided to exhume Witkiewicz&#x27;s body, move it to Zakopane, and give it a solemn funeral. This was carried out according to plan, though no one was allowed to open the coffin that had been delivered by the Soviet authorities.

On 26 November 1994, the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art ordered the exhumation of the presumed grave of Witkiewicz in Zakopane. Genetic tests on the remaining bones proved that the body had belonged to an unknown woman.

==Performances of work==
* &quot;The Crazy Locomotive&quot; (&quot;Szalona lokomotywa&quot;) received its New York premier at the Chelsea Theatre in 1977, under the direction of Des McAnuff. The Obie Award-winning production starred Dwight Schultz, Bob DeFrank and Glenn Close in leading roles.
* Two New York premiers of Witkacy plays: &quot;The Madman and the Nun&quot; &quot;(Wariat i zakonnica)&quot; in 1979 under the direction of Paul Berman and &quot;The Water Hen&quot; &quot;(Kurka Wodna)&quot; directed by Brad Mays were staged by the &quot;Theatre Off-Park&quot;, in 1983. Broadway producer / Theatre Off-Park managing director Patricia Flynn Peate produced both plays, which were well received by critics and audiences alike. Future New York Times theatre critic Mark Matousek, then writing for the theatrical journal &quot;Other Stages&quot;, praised &quot;The Water Hen&quot; for &quot;masterful comic direction,&quot; and the piece was videotaped for permanent inclusion in the Lincoln Center&#x27;s Billy Rose Theatre Collection.
* The British premiere of &quot;They&quot; &quot;(Oni)&quot; was presented at the Polish Theatre Hammersmith, London by POSK, directed by Paul Brightwell in 1984
* The New York premiere of &quot;The Shoemakers&quot; &quot;(Szewcy)&quot; was presented by the &quot;Jean Cocteau Repertory&quot; under the direction of Włodzimierz Herman in 1987.
* &quot;The Madman and the Nun&quot; was presented in 1989 by &quot;The Cosmic Bicycle Theatre&quot; at the &quot;Summer Music from Greensborough&quot;, a Classical Music Festival in Greensborough, Vermont, and in Boston, at The Charlestown Working Theatre. Directed by Jonathan Edward Cross [a.k.a. Jonny ClockWorks]. The production used Actors alongside Life-sized Puppets. Two of the original Puppet Figures are in the collection of the Witkacy Teatre in Zarkopane&#x27; Poland.
* The New York premiere of Witkacy&#x27;s &quot;Tumor Brainiowicz&quot; presented by &quot;La MaMa ETC&quot; was performed by &quot;The Theatre of a Two-Headed Calf&quot; (named after the Witkacy play &quot;Metaphysics of a Two-Headed Calf&quot;), under the direction of Brooke O&#x27;Harra. This production was followed by Witkacy&#x27;s &quot;The Mother&quot; in 2003, also under O&#x27;Harra&#x27;s direction and also a New York premier. The production featured puppets and video.
* In 2019 &quot;Witkacy/Two-Headed Calf&quot;, a collaboration between CalArts Center for New Performance and STUDIO teatrgaleria, Warsaw, was directed by Natalia Korczakowska

<text>Yeovil Junction is the busier, but less central, of two railway stations serving the town of Yeovil in Somerset, England; the other is . The station is sited outside the town, in the village of Stoford; although Yeovil is in Somerset, the station was in Dorset until 1991. It is located down the line from .

It was opened by the London and South Western Railway in 1860, on its London to Exeter line now known as the West of England Main Line. Today, it is managed by South Western Railway and is also the home of the Yeovil Railway Centre.

==History==

The Salisbury and Yeovil Railway (S&amp;YR) opened the final part of its line from on 1 June 1860. Near Bradford Abbas it crossed over the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth line of the Great Western Railway (GWR) on a bridge, then ran alongside it and the Yeovil Branch Line of the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&amp;ER) to reach that company’s terminus at , on the west side of Yeovil. Just a few weeks later, on 19 July, the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) opened its Yeovil and Exeter line. This left the S&amp;YR at Bradford Abbas Junction and crossed over the GWR line to its own station at Yeovil Junction, and then continued on towards Exeter Queen Street. The station was a junction because another line led back to join the S&amp;YR at River Junction, so trains could run from Exeter direct to Hendford (the terminus was moved to a joint B&amp;ER/LSWR Yeovil Town railway station from 1 June 1861). The original eastwards connection from River Junction to Bradford Abbas was closed in 1870, after which most main line trains only called at Yeovil Junction where passengers could change onto a connecting train for the short journey to Yeovil Town. The LSWR operated all trains over the S&amp;YR and bought the smaller company in 1878.

The station at this time had two platforms serving three tracks. The northern side was the track for trains to and London Waterloo; the middle track was covered by a train shed and could be used from either platform and was for the trains to Yeovil Town; the southern track was for trains to Exeter. Goods traffic was handled on the north side of the main line, and a turntable was placed on the south side. On 13 June 1864 a new line was opened from the GWR up to a goods station at Clifton Maybank adjacent to the LSWR station. The GWR was, until 1874, a broad gauge line and broad and standard gauge wagons could be brought alongside each other at Clifton Maybank to allow goods to be transhipped between them.

Work started in 1907 to enlarge the station and was completed in 1909. The new northern platform was long with a track on either side; the northern track was for the Yeovil Town trains and the southern side was for main line services to London. The southern platform also had two tracks, the northern face for westbound trains and the opposite side was a goods siding. Two through tracks also passed between the platforms for non-stop trains. A footbridge at the west end connected the two platforms and extended over the branch track to the station forecourt. A second footbridge was erected at the east end of the station but was dismantled in 1920 and moved up the line to Overton railway station. The goods yard was also extended in 1908 and new sidings were laid near the GWR exchange siding. The cost of the work was in excess of £47,000.

The LSWR became a part of the Southern Railway (SR) in 1923 as a result of the Railways Act 1921. The GWR’s Clifton Maybank branch closed on 7 June 1937. Wagons would in future be exchanged at Yeovil Town, but the GWR had to build a road for Mr Paul, the owner of a private siding which had connected with their line, so that he could bring his goods to the Clifton Maybank platform instead which was still served by the SR.

A new connection was established between the two companies during World War II to allow trains direct access between Yeovil Junction and on the Weymouth line. This was opened on 13 October 1943 and offered a new route for trains of war materials as well as a diversion route in the event of bomb damage.

On 1 January 1948 the Southern Railway was nationalised to become the Southern Region of British Railways. January 1963 saw all the lines in the area transferred to the Western Region and this was soon followed by the &quot;Reshaping of British Railways&quot; report. Yeovil Town closed to passengers on 2 October 1966, the branch service then operated to Pen Mill until it was withdrawn entirely on 4 May 1968. The main line had been rationalised on 11 June 1967 – Yeovil was now in the middle of a single track section between Sherborne and . This soon proved a rationalisation too far and the double track was restored between Sherborne and Yeovil Junction on 1 October 1967 but all trains had to use the eastbound main line platform. On 26 March 1975 the former branch platform was reopened as a through line so that two trains could use the station at the same time. A limited passenger service to Yeovil Pen Mill was reinstated in 2015 since when this has gradually increased in frequency.

A permanent way depot was established in the old goods yard on the north side of the station in 1965. A small Ruston and Hornsby four-wheel diesel locomotive number DS1169 was kept here for shunting until 1972. In 2001 the area was used by the Somerset and Dorset Locomotive Company as a depot for its fleet of hire locomotives, although this use has now ceased. The turntable has been retained on the south side of the line and is often used for turning the locomotives of steam-hauled excursions. This and the Clifton Maybank site has been the home of the Yeovil Railway Centre since 1993.

=== Signalling ===
The first signal boxes were built in 1875. &quot;Yeovil Junction No. 1&quot; was on the north side of the line at the west of the station, and &quot;Yeovil Junction No. 2&quot; was at the opposite end. When the station was rebuilt in 1908 the No. 1 Box was replaced by a new 60-lever &quot;Yeovil Junction East&quot; situated between the main and branch lines; No. 2 box was extended and renamed &quot;Yeovil Junction West&quot;. The latter was damaged in an accident on 20 August 1918 but was rebuilt. At the end of 1949 they were renamed again, the East Box becoming &quot;Yeovil Junction A&quot; and the West Box &quot;Yeovil Junction B&quot;.

The 1967 rationalisation saw the closure of the B Box on 30 April but the A Box was retained to control movements on the branch to Yeovil Town and Pen Mill. A siding connection to the main line was controlled by &quot;Yeovil Junction West Ground Frame&quot;, while &quot;Yeovil Junction East Ground Frame&quot; was used for a connection to the sidings on the south side of the main line. When the double track was reinstated to Sherborne the signal box frame was replaced with a Western Region one of 44 levers.

The remaining box was closed in March 2012, when the line between Salisbury and Exmouth Junction was re-signalled. Signalling here is now supervised from Basingstoke Rail Operating Centre.

===Accidents and incidents===
There have been a number of accidents at Yeovil Junction over the years, although most were minor with few injuries.
* 20 September 1860 – the rear coach of a Yeovil Junction to Hendford train derailed on the points leading onto the branch.
* October 1860 – a goods train going towards Hendford collided with a passenger train coming the other way.
* 12 June 1886 – a collision between a goods train and a passenger train to Yeovil Town due to confusing signals.
* 13 July 1887 – a locomotive collided with the coaches to which it was going to couple, knocking them almost along the track and injuring nine passengers.
* 26 July 1887 – an empty passenger carriage derailed while it was being added to a London train.
* 4 July 1914 – a coupling of an eastbound goods train broke. The rear part collided with the front from Yeovil Junction, knocking the wooden upper storey off the West signal box.
* 20 August 1918 – a collision between locomotives occurred due to the signalman not following rules.

==Location==
The entrance to the station is across the footbridge from the car park on the north side of the line. The garage in the middle of the car park is the station’s original goods shed, and the remaining goods sidings are at the end of the car park. Descending from the footbridge to the platform brings passengers to the main station offices, which are built from red bricks with red glazed abutments. A second similar building at the east end of the platform is the station buffet which still contains its original (1908) counter. Now known as &quot;Peppers&quot;, in 2009 it appeared in a list of &quot;highly commended&quot; station cafes published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; but came under new management in 2011.

== Platform layout ==
Tracks serve both sides of the platform and are each signalled for trains to run in either direction.

Beyond the east end of the platform was the signal box, now demolished. The tracks to London are on its right, and the single track to Yeovil Pen Mill is on its left. No regular passenger services operated over this route from 1968 until December 2015 when a limited service was introduced between London Waterloo and Yeovil Pen Mill via Yeovil Junction.

Opposite the main platform the old eastbound through line has been lifted but the westbound line is retained as a siding, accessible only from the east end of the station. Beyond is the old westbound platform which is no longer connected to the main station but is used by occasional visiting steam trains and by the Yeovil Railway Centre which lies to the south. The turntable is at the right of their railway centre. It makes use of tracks to the left which are on the site of the old GWR Clifton Maybank goods depot. At the far end is a raised earthwork that looks like it once carried another siding, but it is in fact part of the original scheme of 1864 which envisaged another link from Clifton Maybank southwards towards which was never completed.

==Services==

South Western Railway operate services at least once per hour during the daytime to London Waterloo and . A limited service operates to , some of which then continue to London Waterloo via .


There are bus services to Yeovil and the nearby village of Barwick, these are provided by South West Coaches service 68.
Connection by bus to Yeovil Pen Mill is accessible via a change at Yeovil Bus Station (using South West Coaches Services 68 &amp; 70). This runs roughly 0700 to 1810 Monday to Saturday (except Public Holidays).

<text>Stanisław Witkiewicz (; 8 May 1851 – 5 September 1915) was a Polish painter, art theoretician, and amateur architect, known for his creation of &quot;Zakopane Style&quot;.

== Life ==
Witkiewicz was born in the Samogitian village of Pašiaušė (), present-day Lithuania, ruled at the time by the Russian Empire. His parents were Ignacy and Elwira Witkiewicz. Elwira came from a wealthy Szemiot family and grew up in a palace in Diktariškiai.

Ignacy Witkiewicz at the age of 17 was a participant in the November Uprising, and after it ended he settled on the family estate and took up agriculture. The legend of his brother Jan Prosper, sentenced to long-term military service for his patriotic activities at school age, was alive in the family. In the Russian army, he made a career as a researcher of Central Asia and a diplomat, and in the family tradition was considered a “Polish Wallenrod,” seeking to provoke a Russian-British conflict. Elwira&#x27;s brother was Franciszek Szemiot, a commander in the November Uprising, then traveling the world looking for opportunities to fight for a free Poland, he was friends with Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki, the latter dedicated a poem to him. The memory of heroic family members influenced the patriotic atmosphere of the household. 

Ignacy and Elwira had twelve children, the first daughter Elwira was born in 1840, followed by Angelika, Wiktor, Anna, Barbara, Jan, Ignacy, Stanisław, Maria, Aniela and Eugenia, born in 1856. Three daughters, Angelika, Anna and Justyna died in childhood.

The Witkiewicz family, especially Elwira, sought to raise the consciousness of the people, adhering to democratic views similar to those preached by Szymon Konarski&#x27;s Association of the Polish People. Elwira founded a hospital for peasants in Pašiaušė and a school for their children, where her eldest daughter taught them in Polish and Lithuanian. Lithuanian was also taught to all the Witkiewicz children.

As an adolescent, he spent several years in Siberian Tomsk, where his parents and two older siblings were exiled for their support of the January Uprising. He was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Saint Petersburg (1868–1871) and furthered his education in Munich (1872–1875). During his stay in Munich, he befriended painters Aleksander Gierymski, Józef Chełmoński and Henryk Siemiradzki.

In 1875, he moved to Warsaw and set up a painting workshop in the laundry at the Hotel Europejski. In 1884, he married Maria Pietrzkiewicz. The pair had a son, Stanisław Ignacy. The son&#x27;s godmother was the internationally famous actress Helena Modjeska, whom the elder Witkiewicz in 1876 had nearly accompanied to California in the United States.

In 1884–1887, Witkiewicz worked as the artistic director of &quot;Wędrowiec&quot; weekly, for which he wrote a series of articles concerning the values of a work of art and the role of art critics (published in book form under the title &quot;Painting and criticism among us&quot;, &quot;Sztuka i krytyka u nas&quot;, in 1891 and 1899). In 1887, he held the same position in &quot;Kłosy&quot; magazine.

In 1886, he visited Zakopane for the first time. He developed a fascination with the Tatra Mountains, the Podhale highlanders and their vernacular traditions. His ambition became to create a Polish national style based on the highlanders&#x27; art, which he considered quintessentially Polish.

He formulated the Zakopane Style (&quot;styl zakopiański&quot;) (also known as Witkiewicz Style (&quot;styl witkiewiczowski&quot;)) in architecture, in which he designed homes and interiors for well-off, artistically-minded Poles. He was strongly associated with Zakopane and promoted it in the art community.

Witkiewicz had strong views against formal education:&quot;School is completely at odds with the psychological make-up of human beings&quot;.He applied this principle in his son&#x27;s upbringing and was disappointed when the 20-year-old Witkacy chose to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków.

In 1908, suffering from tuberculosis, the elder Witkiewicz left his family in Zakopane and relocated to Lovran, a fashionable resort in what was then Austria-Hungary, which today is in Croatia. He died there in 1915.

His first monographic art exhibition was staged in Zachęta Fine Arts Society in 1927. His son, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, became a famous painter, playwright, novelist and philosopher, also known (from the conflation of his surname and middle name) by the pseudonym &quot;Witkacy.&quot;

<doc id="396043" wikidata="Q555224" url="?curid=396043" title="Henri-Edmond Cross">
<text>Henri-Edmond Cross (; 20 May 1856 – 16 May 1910), born Henri-Edmond-Joseph Delacroix (), was a French painter and printmaker. He is most acclaimed as a master of Neo-Impressionism and he played an important role in shaping the second phase of that movement. He was a significant influence on Henri Matisse and many other artists. His work was instrumental in the development of Fauvism.

==Background and education==
Henri-Edmond-Joseph Delacroix was born in Douai, a commune in the Nord department in northern France, on 20May 1856. He had no surviving siblings. His parents, with a family history of ironmongery, were Alcide Delacroix, a French adventurer, and British Fanny Woollett.

In 1865 the family moved to a location near Lille, a northern French city close to the Belgian border. Alcide&#x27;s cousin, Dr.Auguste Soins, recognized Henri&#x27;s artistic talent and was very supportive of his artistic inclinations, even financing the boy&#x27;s first drawing instructions under painter Carolus-Duran the following year. Henri was Duran&#x27;s protégé for a year. His studies continued for a short time in Paris in 1875 with François Bonvin before returning to Lille. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts, and in 1878 he enrolled at the Écoles Académiques de Dessin et d&#x27;Architecture, studying for three years in the studio of Alphonse Colas. His art education continued, under fellow Douai artist Émile Dupont-Zipcy, after moving to Paris in 1881.

==Early work==

Cross&#x27;s early works, portraits and still lifes, were in the dark colors of Realism. In order to distinguish himself from the famous Romantic painter Eugène Delacroix, he changed his name in 1881, shortening and Anglicizing his birth name to &quot;Henri Cross&quot; – the French word &quot;croix&quot; means &quot;cross&quot;. 1881 was also the year of his first exhibition at the Salon des Artistes Français. He painted many landscapes on an 1883 trip to the Alpes-Maritimes, accompanied by his family. Dr.Soins, who was also along on the trip, was the subject of a painting that Cross exhibited at Nice&#x27;s Exposition Universelle later in the year. During the Mediterranean trip, Cross met Paul Signac, who became a close friend and artistic influence.

In 1884 Cross co-founded the Société des Artistes Indépendants, which consisted of artists displeased with the practices of the official Salon, and presented unjuried exhibitions without prizes. There, he met and became friends with many artists involved in the Neo-Impressionist movement, including Georges Seurat, Albert Dubois-Pillet, and Charles Angrand. Despite his association with the Neo-Impressionists, Cross did not adopt their style for many years. His work continued to manifest influences such as Jules Bastien-Lepage and Édouard Manet, as well as the Impressionists. The change from his early, somber, Realist work was gradual. His color palette became lighter, working in the brighter colors of Impressionism. He also worked &quot;en plein air&quot;. In the latter part of the 1880s, he painted pure landscapes that showed the influence of Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro. In about 1886, again attempting to differentiate himself from another French artist – this time, Henri Cros – he again changed his name, finally adopting &quot;Henri-Edmond Cross&quot;.

In 1891 Cross began painting in the Neo-Impressionist style, and exhibited his first large piece using this technique in an Indépendants show. That painting was a divisionist portrait of Madame Hector France, née Irma Clare, whom Cross had met in 1888 and would marry in 1893. Robert Rosenblum wrote that &quot;the picture is softly charged with a granular, atmospheric glow&quot;.

Cross had wintered in the south of France from 1883 onward, until, suffering from rheumatism, he finally moved there full-time in 1891. His works were still exhibited in Paris. His first residence in southern France was in Cabasson, near Le Lavandou, then he settled a short distance away, in the small hamlet of Saint-Clair, where he spent the remainder of his life, leaving only for trips to Italy in 1903 and 1908, and for his annual Indépendants exhibits in Paris. In 1892 Cross&#x27;s friend Paul Signac moved to nearby Saint-Tropez, where they frequently hosted gatherings in Cross&#x27;s garden, attended by artists including Henri Matisse, André Derain, and Albert Marquet.

Cross&#x27;s affinity with the Neo-Impressionist movement extended beyond the painting style to include their political philosophies. Like Signac, Pissarro, and other Neo-Impressionists, Cross believed in anarchist principles, with hope for a utopian society. In 1896 Cross created a lithograph, &quot;L&#x27;Errant&quot; (&quot;The Wanderer&quot;). This marked the first time he had worked with a publisher, and the piece was featured anonymously in &quot;Les Temps Nouveaux&quot;, Jean Grave&#x27;s anarchist journal. Cross&#x27;s anarchist sentiments influenced his choice of subjects: he painted scenes illustrating a utopian world that could exist through anarchism.

The process of creating Divisionist paintings with numerous small dots of color was tedious and time-consuming. When Cross wanted to depict quick impressions, he created watercolor or colored pencil images in his sketchbooks. He wrote of a rustic French outing:

==Later years==
Cross&#x27;s paintings of the early- to mid-1890s are characteristically Pointillist, with closely and regularly positioned tiny dots of color. Beginning around 1895, he gradually shifted his technique, instead using broad, blocky brushstrokes and leaving small areas of exposed bare canvas between the strokes. The resulting surfaces resembled mosaics, and the paintings may be seen as precursors to Fauvism and Cubism. In the Pointillist style, minute spots of paint were used to blend colors harmoniously; in contrast, the strategy in &quot;second generation Neo-Impressionism&quot; was to keep the colors separate, resulting in &quot;vibrant shimmering visual effects through contrast&quot;. Cross stated that the Neo-Impressionists were &quot;far more interested in creating harmonies of pure color, than in harmonizing the colors of a particular landscape or natural scene&quot;. Matisse and other artists were very influenced by the late-career Cross, and such works were instrumental in forming the principles of Fauvism. Among the other artists influenced by Cross were André Derain, Henri Manguin, Charles Camoin, Albert Marquet, Jean Puy, and Louis Valtat.

In 1905 Galerie Druet in Paris mounted Cross&#x27;s first solo exhibition, which featured thirty paintings and thirty watercolors. The show was very successful, receiving critical acclaim, and most of the works were sold. Belgian Symbolist poet Emile Verhaeren, an avid supporter of Neo-Impressionism in his country, provided the preface for the exhibition catalog, writing:


In the early 1880s Cross began to experience trouble with his eyes, which grew more severe in the 1900s. He also increasingly suffered from arthritis. At least in part due to these health issues that plagued him for years, Cross&#x27;s body of work is relatively small. However, in his last years he was productive and very creative, and his work was featured in significant solo exhibitions; he received great acclaim from critics and enjoyed commercial success.

In 1909 Cross was treated in a Paris hospital for cancer. In January 1910 he returned to Saint-Clair, where he died of the cancer just four days short of his 54th birthday, on 16May 1910. His tomb, in the Le Lavandou cemetery, features a bronze medallion that his friend Théo van Rysselberghe had designed. In July 1911, the city of Cross&#x27;s birth, Douai, mounted a retrospective exhibition of his work.

==Selected exhibitions==

In addition to the exhibitions mentioned above, Cross participated in many others. Octave Maus invited him to exhibit his work in several of the &quot;Annual Exhibitions&quot; of LesXX. Cross participated in the Libre Esthétique show of 1895 at Maus&#x27;s invitation, and also in those of 1897, 1901, 1904, 1908, and 1909. In 1898 he participated with Paul Signac, Maximilien Luce, and Théo van Rysselberghe in the first Neo-Impressionist exhibition in Germany, organized by Harry Kessler at Keller und Reiner Gallery (Berlin). In 1907 Félix Fénéon assembled a Cross retrospective in Paris at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, with Maurice Denis contributing the catalogue preface. Other venues with Cross exhibitions included Samuel Bing&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Art Nouveau à Paris&quot;, Galerie Durand-Ruel (Paris), Cassirer Gallery (Hamburg, Berlin), Toison d&#x27;or exhibition (Moscow), Bernheim-Jeune&#x27;s &quot;Aquarelle et pastel&quot;, and various others, including galleries in Paris, Dresden, Weimar, and Munich.

<text>Lääne-Viru County ( or &quot;Lääne-Virumaa&quot;) is one of 15 counties of Estonia. It is in northern Estonia, on the south coast of the Gulf of Finland. In Estonian, &quot;lääne&quot; means western and &quot;ida&quot; means east or eastern. Lääne-Viru borders Ida-Viru County to the east, Jõgeva County to the south, and Järva and Harju counties to the west. In January 2013, Lääne-Viru County had a population of 58,806: 4.5% of the population in Estonia.

== History ==
In prehistoric times, Lääne-Virumaa was settled by Estonians of the Vironian tribe.

== County government ==
The County Government () is led by a governor (), who is appointed by the Government of Estonia. Since 2014, the governor position has been held by Marko Torm. The county seat is Rakvere.

== Municipalities ==
The county is subdivided into municipalities. There is one urban municipality ( – towns) and seven rural municipalities ( – parishes) in Lääne-Viru County.

== Religion ==

The largest number of congregations in the county are of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (EELC): in Haljala, Kunda, Kadrina, Käsmu, Rakvere, Simuna, Tamsalu, Viru-Jaagupi, Viru-Nigula and Väike-Maarja under EELC&#x27;s Viru Deanery and in Tapa under EELC&#x27;s Järva Deanery.

Eastern Orthodox congregations in the county are predominantly under the administration of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church but some of them are also under the Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.

Several congregations of Baptists, a catholic congregation in Rakvere and other Christian churches operate in the county.

<doc id="396054" wikidata="Q1412867" url="?curid=396054" title="Dietary Reference Intake">
<text>The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) is a system of nutrition recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) of the National Academies (United States). It was introduced in 1997 in order to broaden the existing guidelines known as Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs, see below). The DRI values differ from those used in nutrition labeling on food and dietary supplement products in the U.S. and Canada, which uses Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Values (%DV) which were based on outdated RDAs from 1968 but were updated as of 2016.

==Parameters==

DRI provides several different types of reference values:
* Estimated Average Requirements (EAR), are expected to satisfy the needs of 50% of the people in that age group based on a review of the scientific literature.
* Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), the daily dietary intake level of a nutrient considered sufficient by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine to meet the requirements of 97.5% of healthy individuals in each life stage and sex group. The definition implies that the intake level would cause a harmful nutrient deficiency in just 2.5%. It is calculated based on the EAR and is usually approximately 20% higher than the EAR (See Calculating the RDA).
* Adequate Intake (AI), where no RDA has been established, but the amount established is somewhat less firmly believed to be adequate for everyone in the demographic group.
* Tolerable upper intake levels (UL), to caution against excessive intake of nutrients (like vitamin A and selenium) that can be harmful in large amounts. This is the highest level of daily nutrient consumption that is considered to be safe for, and cause no side effects in, 97.5% of healthy individuals in each life stage and sex group. The definition implies that the intake level would cause a harmful nutrient excess in just 2.5%. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has also established ULs which do not always agree with U.S. ULs. For example, adult zinc UL is 40 mg in the U.S. and 25 mg in EFSA.
* Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR), are a range of intake specified as a percentage of total energy intake. Used for sources of energy, such as fats and carbohydrates.

DRIs are used by both the United States and Canada, and are intended for the general public and health professionals. Applications include:
* Composition of diets for schools, prisons, hospitals or nursing homes
* Industries developing new foods and dietary supplements
* Healthcare policy makers and public health officials
==Other countries==
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL define the same as in the United States, although numerical values may differ.

Australia and New Zealand refer to the collective set of information as Nutrient Reference Values, with Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) instead of RDA, but EAR, AI and UL defined the same as in the United States and Canada, although numerical values may differ.

==History==
The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) was developed during World War II by Lydia J. Roberts, Hazel Stiebeling, and Helen S. Mitchell, all part of a committee established by the United States National Academy of Sciences in order to investigate issues of nutrition that might &quot;affect national defense&quot;.

The committee was renamed the Food and Nutrition Board in 1941, after which they began to deliberate on a set of recommendations of a standard daily allowance for each type of nutrient. The standards would be used for nutrition recommendations for the armed forces, for civilians, and for overseas population who might need food relief. Roberts, Stiebeling, and Mitchell surveyed all available data, created a tentative set of allowances for &quot;energy and eight nutrients&quot;, and submitted them to experts for review (Nestle, 35).

The final set of guidelines, called RDAs for Recommended Dietary Allowances, were accepted in 1941. The allowances were meant to provide superior nutrition for civilians and military personnel, so they included a &quot;margin of safety&quot;. Because of food rationing during the war, the food guides created by government agencies to direct citizens&#x27; nutritional intake also took food availability into account.

The Food and Nutrition Board subsequently revised the RDAs every five to ten years. In the early 1950s, United States Department of Agriculture nutritionists made a new set of guidelines that also included the number of servings of each food group in order to make it easier for people to receive their RDAs of each nutrient.

The DRI was introduced in 1997 in order to broaden the existing system of RDAs. DRIs were published over the period 1998 to 2001. In 2011, revised DRIs were published for calcium and vitamin D. Additionally, revised DRIs were published for potassium and sodium in 2019. The DRI for energy was updated in 2023. None of the other DRIs have been revised since first published 1998 to 2001.

==Current recommendations for United States and Canada==

Highest EARs and RDA/AIs and lowest ULs for people ages nine years and older, except pregnant or lactating women. ULs for younger children may be lower than RDA/AIs for older people. Females need more iron than males and generally need more nutrients when pregnant or lactating.

===Vitamins and choline===
===Minerals===

It is also recommended that the following substances not be added to food or dietary supplements. Research has been conducted into adverse effects, but was not conclusive in many cases:

===Macronutrients===
RDA/AI is shown below for males and females aged 19–50 years.

==Calculating the RDA==

The equations used to calculate the RDA are as follows:

&quot;If the standard deviation (SD) of the EAR is available and the requirement for the nutrient is symmetrically distributed, the RDA is set of two SDs above the EAR:

If data about variability in requirements are insufficient to calculate an SD, a coefficient of variation (CV) for the EAR of 10 percent is assumed, unless available data indicate a greater variation in requirements. If 10 percent is assumed to be the CV, then twice that amount when added to the EAR is defined as equal to the RDA. The resulting equation for the RDA is then

formula_2

This level of intake statistically represents 97.5 percent of the requirements of the population.&quot;

==Standard of evidence==
In September 2007, the Institute of Medicine held a workshop entitled &quot;The Development of DRIs 1994–2004: Lessons Learned and New Challenges&quot;. At that meeting, several speakers stated that the current Dietary Recommended Intakes (DRI&#x27;s) were largely based upon the very lowest rank in the quality of evidence pyramid, that is, opinion, rather than the highest level – randomized controlled clinical trials. Speakers called for a higher standard of evidence to be utilized when making dietary recommendations. The only DRIs to have been revised since that meeting until 2011 are vitamin D and calcium.

<text>Wire recording, also known as magnetic wire recording, was the first magnetic recording technology, an analog type of audio storage. It recorded sound signals on a thin steel wire using varying levels of magnetization. The first crude magnetic recorder was invented in 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen. The first magnetic recorder to be made commercially available anywhere was the Telegraphone, manufactured by the American Telegraphone Company, Springfield, Massachusetts in 1903.

The wire is pulled rapidly across a recording head which magnetizes each point along the wire in accordance with the intensity and polarity of the electrical audio signal being supplied to the recording head at that instant. By later drawing the wire across the same or a similar head while the head is not being supplied with an electrical signal, the varying magnetic field presented by the passing wire induces a similarly varying electric current in the head, recreating the original signal at a reduced level.

Magnetic wire recording was replaced by magnetic tape recording by the 1950s, but devices employing one or the other of these media had been more or less simultaneously under development for many years before either came into widespread use. The principles and electronics involved are nearly identical.

== History ==
The first wire recorder was invented in 1898 by Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen, who gave his product the trade name Telegraphone. Wire recorders for dictation and telephone recording were made almost continuously by multiple companies (mainly the American Telegraphone Company) through the 1920s and 1930s, but use of this new technology was extremely limited. Dictaphone and Ediphone recorders, which still employed wax cylinders as the recording medium, were the devices normally used for these applications during this period.

The peak of wire recording lasted from approximately 1946 to 1954. It resulted from technical improvements and the development of inexpensive designs licensed internationally by the Brush Development Company of Cleveland, Ohio and the Armour Research Foundation of the Armour Institute of Technology (later the IIT Research Institute of the Illinois Institute of Technology). The two organizations (Brush and Armour) licensed dozens of manufacturers in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. Examples are Wilcox-Gay, Peirce, Webcor, and Air King. Sales elsewhere encouraged Sears to provide a model, and some authors to prepare specialized manuals.

These improved wire recorders were not only marketed for office use, but also as home entertainment devices that offered advantages over the home acetate disc recorders which were increasingly sold for making short recordings of family and friends and for recording excerpts from radio broadcasts. Unlike home-cut phonograph records, the steel wire could be reused for new recordings and allowed much longer uninterrupted recordings to be made than the few minutes of audio per side possible with disc recorders.

The earliest magnetic tape recorders, not commercially available in the United States until 1948, were too expensive, complicated, and bulky to compete with these consumer-level wire recorders. During the first half of the 1950s, however, tape recorders which were sufficiently affordable, simple, and compact to be suitable for home and office use started appearing and they rapidly superseded wire recorders in the marketplace.

Exceptionally, the use of wire for sound recording continued into the 1960s in Protona&#x27;s Minifon miniature recorders, in which the importance of maximizing recording time in a minimum of space outweighed other considerations. For any given level of audio quality, the nearly hair-thin wire had the advantage that it was a much more compact storage medium than tape. The Minifon wire recorder was designed for stealth use and its accessories included a microphone disguised as a wristwatch.

Wire recording was also used in some aircraft flight recorders beginning in the early 1940s, mainly for recording radio conversations between crewmen or with ground stations. Because steel wire was more compact, robust, and heat-resistant than magnetic tape (which is plastic-based), wire recorders continued to be manufactured for this purpose through the 1950s and remained in use somewhat later than that. There were also wire recorders made to record data in satellites and other uncrewed spacecraft of the 1950s to perhaps the 1970s.

== Characteristics ==

=== Magnetic format ===
Poulsen&#x27;s original Telegraphone and other very early recorders placed the two poles of the record/replay head on opposite sides of the wire. The wire is thus magnetized transversely to the direction of travel. This method of magnetization was quickly found to have the limitation that as the wire twisted during playback, there were times when the magnetization of the wire was at right angles to the position of the two poles of the head and the output from the head fell to almost zero.

The recorder was improved by placing the two poles on the same side of the wire so that the wire was magnetized along its length or longitudinally. Additionally, the poles were shaped into a &quot;V&quot; so that the head wrapped around the wire to some extent. This increased the magnetizing effect and also increased the sensitivity of the head on replay because it collected more of the magnetic flux from the wire. This system was not entirely immune to twisting but the effects were far less marked.

=== Media capacity and speed ===
Compared to tape recorders, wire recording devices have a high media speed, made necessary because of the use of the solid metal medium. Standard postwar wire recorders use a nominal speed of 24 inches per second (610 mm/s), making a typical one-hour spool of wire 7,200 feet (approx. 2200 m) long. This enormous length is possible on a spool less than in diameter because the wire was very fine, having a diameter of for later models, an improvement over Poulsen&#x27;s Telegraphone of 1898 which used wire. Smaller 30- and 15-minute lengths of wire were employed by the majority of recorders made after 1945. Some heavy-duty recorders use the larger Armour spools, which can contain enough wire to record continuously for several hours. Because the wire is pulled past the head by the take-up spool, the actual wire speed slowly increases as the effective diameter of the take-up spool increases. Standardization prevented this peculiarity from having any impact on the playback of a spool recorded on a different machine, but audible consequences can result from substantially altering the original length of a recorded wire by excisions or by dividing it up onto multiple spools.

=== Fidelity ===
The audio fidelity of a wire recording made on one of these post-1945 machines is comparable to a contemporary phonograph record or one of the early tape recorders, given a microphone or other signal source of equal quality. Because of its homogeneous nature and very high speed, wire is relatively free of the noticeable background hiss that characterized tape recordings before the advent of noise reduction systems. The Magnecord Corp. of Chicago briefly manufactured a high-fidelity wire recorder intended for studio use, but soon abandoned the system to concentrate on tape recorders.

== Handling and editing ==
To facilitate handling as the user threaded the wire across the recording head and affixed it to the take-up spool, some manufacturers attached a strip of plastic to each end of the wire. This was designed to press-fit snugly into either spool. To prevent the wire from piling up unevenly on the spool as it was recorded, played or rewound, on the majority of machines the head assembly slowly oscillates up and down or back and forth to distribute the wire evenly. On some machines, moving wire guides perform this function. These are similar to mechanisms that distribute line across a fishing reel. After recording or playback, the wire has to be rewound before any further use can be made of the machine. Unlike reel-to-reel tape recorders, the take-up reel on most wire recorders is not removable.

A break in the wire is repaired by tying the ends together and trimming. When such a repair is made to an existing recording, a jump in the sound results during playback, but because of the high speed of the wire the loss of an inch due to tying and trimming is trivial and might pass unnoticed. Unfortunately, if the wire breaks it can easily become tangled, and snarls are extremely difficult to fix. Sometimes the only practical solution is to carefully cut the tangled portion away from the spool—an operation which runs the risk of endlessly enlarging the problem—and discard it. The difficulty of handling the wire itself when necessary is arguably the only serious shortcoming, among several definite advantages, of steel wire as a monophonic recording medium.

Editing is accomplished by cutting and splicing. As the knot of each splice passes through the head during playback, a very brief loss of normal contact is inevitable and the resulting dropouts can make editing musical recordings problematic. Although wire is not as suitable for editing as magnetic tape (a plastic-based material) would prove to be, in the field of radio broadcasting it offered tremendous advantages over trying to edit material recorded on transcription discs, which was usually accomplished by dubbing to a new transcription disc with the aid of multiple turntables and stopwatches. The first regularly scheduled network radio program produced and edited on wire was CBS&#x27; &quot;Hear It Now&quot; with Edward R. Murrow.

== Notable uses ==
In 1944–1945, the 3132 Signal Service Company Special of the U.S. Army&#x27;s top secret Ghost Army used wire recorders to create sonic deception on the Western Front in the Second World War. Multiple battlefield scenarios were recreated using military sounds recorded at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The wire-recorded audio, which was played back through powerful amplifiers and speakers mounted on vehicles, was used to conceal real Allied deployments, locations and operations.

In 1944 at the Middle East Radio Station of Cairo, Egyptian composer Halim El-Dabh used wire recorders as a tool to compose music.

In 1946, David Boder, a professor of psychology at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, traveled to Europe to record long interviews with &quot;displaced persons&quot;—most of them Holocaust survivors. Using an early wire recorder from the Armour Research Foundation, Boder came back with the first recorded Holocaust testimonials and in all likelihood the first recorded oral histories of significant length.

In 1946, Norman Corwin and his technical assistant, Lee Bland, took a wire recorder on their One World Flight, a round-the-world trip subsidized by friends of Wendell Willkie and patterned after Willkie&#x27;s own 1942 trip. Corwin documented the post-war world and used his recordings in a series of 13 broadcast documentaries on CBS—which were also among the first broadcast uses of recorded sound allowed by the radio networks.

In 1947, Maya Deren, an American experimental filmmaker, purchased a wire recorder from her Guggenheim Fellowship funds to record Haitian Vodou ceremonies for her documentary: &quot;Meditation on Violence&quot;.

In 1949 at Fuld Hall in Rutgers University, Paul Braverman made a 75-minute recording of a Woody Guthrie concert using a wire recorder. The recording only came to light in 2001, and appears to be the only surviving live recording of Woody Guthrie; it was restored over several years and released on CD in 2007. The CD, &quot;The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949&quot;, subsequently won the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Historical Album.

One of the world&#x27;s first stored-program computers, SEAC, built in 1950 at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards, used wire recorders to store digital data.

In 1952, the Harvard University physics department&#x27;s musical variety show &quot;The Physical Revue&quot;, written by Tom Lehrer and performed by a cast including Lehrer, Lewis M. Branscomb and others, was recorded on wire by a later winner of the Nobel Prize, Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. This recording was recently rediscovered and made available online.

Wire recorders sometimes appear in motion pictures made during the time of their widest use. For example, in office scenes in the original 1951 version of &quot;The Thing&quot;, a typical Webster-Chicago unit is plainly visible on a small table by the window. In some shots (e.g., at 0:11:40 on the 2003 DVD release), its detached lid, carrying two extra spools of wire, is also visible. In this instance the recorder is simply &quot;set dressing&quot; and is not shown in operation. Ann Robinson&#x27;s character in the 1954 &quot;Dragnet&quot; feature film carried and used a Protona Minifon wire recorder to gather evidence in a pivotal scene. The 1958 spy thriller &quot;Spy in the Sky!&quot; uses a wire recording as a plot device. In the episode &quot;The Relaxed Informer&quot; (S1E24) of &quot;Danger Man&quot; the spy courier is smuggling a recording made on wire secreted inside the handle holding a puppet&#x27;s strings. The recording wire is later shown being played in an office using a wire player. In episode 2.18 of &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;Semi-Private Eye&quot;, PI Homer Garrity has a wire recorder he uses to surreptitiously record his clients.

The fictional Allied officers of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; used a wire recorder to record a meeting in Kommandant Klink&#x27;s office on a device that was disguised as a sewing box made of wooden thread spools. A wire recording was the subject of a 1966 &quot;&quot; episode titled &quot;A Spool There Was&quot;. The &quot;Department S&quot; episode &quot;A Cellar Full of Silence&quot; revolves around a blackmail recording on a wire disguised as part of another object. A wire recorder is also used as a plot device in Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1949 play, &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;.

Similarly, in the 1990 film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, set in the 1930s, Warren Beatty, in the title role, is shown manipulating a wire on which the voice of Mumbles (played by Dustin Hoffman) is recorded, in order to decipher the otherwise unintelligible speech of the fictitious criminal.

In the 1990 film &quot;The Two Jakes&quot;, set in 1948, the plot centers around a wire recording made in a divorce-case-turned-homicide.

In the TV series &quot;Bones&quot;, Series 10, Episode 2, &quot;The Lance to the Heart&quot;, an old wire recording of JFK is found in the house of a former agent of J. Edgar Hoover.

More recently in a UK Sky History TV series &quot;U-boat Wargamers&quot;, in the last episode Captain Gilbert Roberts CBE debriefs the German U-boat Admiral Eberhard Godt using a Wirex Electronics Ltd of Edgware, London model B1 wire recorder to record the debrief (the machine is shown running). He secretly uses a second machine, hidden in an attache case, to record the more casual conversation after the main unit is switched off. The main machine depicted was actually not manufactured until 1951.

<doc id="396065" wikidata="Q845571" url="?curid=396065" title="Casti connubii">
<text>Casti connubii (Latin: &quot;of chaste wedlock&quot;) is a papal encyclical promulgated by Pope Pius XI on 31 December 1930 in response to the Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion. It stressed the sanctity of marriage, prohibited Catholics from using any form of artificial birth control, and reaffirmed the prohibition on abortion. It also explained the authority of church doctrine on moral matters, and advocated that civil governments follow the lead of the church in this area.

==Topics==
&quot;Casti connubii&quot; was a response to the Lambeth Conference of 1930 in which the Anglican Communion approved the use of birth control in limited circumstances. It covered four major topics: the sanctity of marriage, opposition to eugenics, positions on birth control and the purpose of sexuality, and reaffirmation of the prohibition on abortion.

===Sanctity of marriage===
Pope Pius XI&#x27;s encyclical references and confirms &quot;Arcanum&quot; (1880) on Christian marriage by Pope Leo XIII.
Catholic doctrine has always considered matrimony to be a most holy state of life for those called to the married life (Thomas Aquinas &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;; Augustine of Hippo &quot;On the Goods of Marriage&quot;). This encyclical reaffirms that marriage is a sacrament, and a means to sanctifying grace.

The encyclical also affirms the church&#x27;s opposition to adultery and divorce, and its support of wives as homemakers. It calls for wives to be obedient to their husbands, while commanding husbands to love their wives as &quot;Christ loved His Church&quot;.

This ... does not deny or take away the liberty which fully belongs to the woman both in view of her dignity as a human person, and in view of her most noble office as wife and mother and companion; nor does it bid her obey her husband&#x27;s every request if not in harmony with right reason or with the dignity due to wife; ... For if the man is the head, the woman is the heart, and as he occupies the chief place in ruling, so she may and ought to claim for herself the chief place in love.

===Opposition to eugenics===
&quot;Casti connubii&quot; speaks out against the eugenics laws, then popular, that forbade those deemed &#x27;unfit&#x27; from marrying and having children: &quot;Those who act in this way are at fault in losing sight of the fact that the family is more sacred than the State and that men are begotten not for the earth and for time, but for Heaven and eternity.&quot;

It also took a strong stand against forced sterilizations. Pius XI stated that if no crime has taken place and there is no cause present for grave punishment, magistrates have no direct power over the bodies of their subjects. He cited Thomas Aquinas:
St. Thomas teaches this when inquiring whether human judges for the sake of preventing future evils can inflict punishment, he admits that the power indeed exists as regards certain other forms of evil, but justly and properly denies it as regards the maiming of the body.

===Birth control and the purpose of sexuality===
Prior to this encyclical, it was believed by some Catholics that the only licit reason for sexual intercourse was an attempt to create children. At the time, there was no official church position on any non-procreative purposes of intercourse. &quot;Casti connubii&quot; does repeat several times that the conjugal act is intrinsically tied with procreation:
However, &quot;Casti connubii&quot; also acknowledges the unitive aspect of intercourse as licit:
&quot;Casti connubii&quot; also reaffirms the dignity of the human conjugal act as distinct from the conjugal acts of animals, by its volitive nature; that is, the act is not merely biological
but rooted in the will and therefore a personal act.

The &#x27;natural reasons of time or of certain defects&#x27; are universally accepted as meaning menopause and infertility. This paragraph thus means menopausal and infertile couples may morally engage in intercourse, even though there is no possibility of children resulting from the act.

The &#x27;natural reasons of time&#x27; is interpreted by some to also mean the infertile portion 
of a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle. The practice of avoiding pregnancy by abstaining from sexual relations when the woman is fertile (natural family planning) was first addressed in rulings by the Sacred Penitentiary in 1853 and 1880, which declared the practice moral. However, a few Catholic theologians continued to hold that such practices were equivalent
to contraception and thus immoral, and some historians consider two 1951 speeches by Pope Pius XII to be the first explicit church acceptance of natural family planning. The church&#x27;s view of contraception was explored further in the 1968 encyclical &quot;Humanae vitae&quot; by Pope Paul VI, and by Pope John Paul II&#x27;s lecture series later entitled Theology of the Body.

===Abortion===
This encyclical repeats the church&#x27;s condemnation of abortion in all circumstances. It also draws a connection between contracepting couples and couples that have abortions: &quot;... those wicked parents who seek to remain childless, and failing in this, are not ashamed to put their offspring to death.&quot;

==Reactions and impact==
In a 1932 article published in &quot;The Nation&quot;, Margaret Sanger gave her personal reaction to the encyclical, saying that it was an obstacle to general approval of the birth-control movement by political leaders unwilling to oppose the leadership of the church. She also asserts that it is &quot;not in accord with science and definitely against social welfare and race improvement&quot;.

&quot;Casti connubii&quot; is most noted for its anti-contraception position. Unlike major Protestant denominations, the Catholic Church has continued its opposition to artificial birth control. This encyclical, along with &quot;Humanae vitae&quot;, has come to represent that stance.

<text>In mathematics, two functions have a contact of order if, at a point , they have the same value and their first derivatives are equal. This is an equivalence relation, whose equivalence classes are generally called jets. The point of osculation is also called the double cusp. Contact is a geometric notion; it can be defined algebraically as a valuation.

One speaks also of curves and geometric objects having -th order contact at a point: this is also called &quot;osculation&quot; (i.e. kissing), generalising the property of being tangent. (Here the derivatives are considered with respect to arc length.) An osculating curve from a given family of curves is a curve that has the highest possible order of contact with a given curve at a given point; for instance a tangent line is an osculating curve from the family of lines, and has first-order contact with the given curve; an osculating circle is an osculating curve from the family of circles, and has second-order contact (same tangent angle and curvature), etc.

== Applications ==
Contact forms are particular differential forms of degree 1 on odd-dimensional manifolds; see contact geometry. Contact transformations are related changes of coordinates, of importance in classical mechanics. See also Legendre transformation.

Contact between manifolds is often studied in singularity theory, where the type of contact are classified, these include the &quot;A&quot; series (&quot;A&quot;0: crossing, &quot;A&quot;1: tangent, &quot;A&quot;2: osculating, ...) and the umbilic or &quot;D&quot;-series where there is a high degree of contact with the sphere.

==Contact between curves==
Two curves in the plane intersecting at a point &quot;p&quot; are said to have:
*0th-order contact if the curves have a simple crossing (not tangent).
*1st-order contact if the two curves are tangent.
*2nd-order contact if the curvatures of the curves are equal. Such curves are said to be osculating.
*3rd-order contact if the derivatives of the curvature are equal.
*4th-order contact if the second derivatives of the curvature are equal.

===Contact between a curve and a circle===


For each point &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) on a smooth plane curve &quot;S&quot;, there is exactly one osculating circle, whose radius is the reciprocal of κ(&quot;t&quot;), the curvature of &quot;S&quot; at &quot;t&quot;. Where curvature is zero (at an inflection point on the curve), the osculating circle is a straight line. The locus of the centers of all the osculating circles (also called &quot;centers of curvature&quot;) is the evolute of the curve.

If the derivative of curvature κ&#x27;(&quot;t&quot;) is zero, then the osculating circle will have 3rd-order contact and the curve is said to have a vertex. The evolute will have a cusp at the center of the circle. The sign of the second derivative of curvature determines whether the curve has a local minimum or maximum of curvature. All closed curves will have at least four vertices, two minima and two maxima (the four-vertex theorem).

In general a curve will not have 4th-order contact with any circle. However, 4th-order contact can occur generically in a 1-parameter family of curves, at a curve in the family where (as the parameter varies) two vertices (one maximum and one minimum) come together and annihilate. At such points the second derivative of curvature will be zero.

Ccircles which have two-point contact with two points &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1), &quot;S&quot;(&quot;t&quot;2) on a curve are &quot;bi-tangent&quot; circles. The centers of all bi-tangent circles form the symmetry set. The medial axis is a subset of the symmetry set.

<doc id="396072" wikidata="Q1896776" url="?curid=396072" title="Paul Hellyer">
<text>Paul Theodore Hellyer (August 6, 1923 – August 8, 2021) was a Canadian engineer, politician, writer, and commentator. He was the longest serving member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada at the time of his death.

==Early life==
Hellyer was born and raised on a farm near Waterford, Ontario, the son of Lulla Maude (Anderson) and Audrey Samuel Hellyer. Upon completion of high school, he studied aeronautical engineering at the Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute of Aeronautics in Glendale, California, graduating in 1941. While studying, he also obtained a private pilot&#x27;s licence.

After graduation, Hellyer was employed at Fleet Aircraft in Fort Erie, Ontario, which was then making training craft for the Royal Canadian Air Force as part of Canada&#x27;s war effort in World War II. He attempted to become an RCAF pilot himself, but was told no more pilots were necessary, after which he joined the Royal Canadian Artillery and served in Canada as a gunner for the duration of the war.

Hellyer earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto in 1949.

==Early political career==
First elected as a Liberal in 1949 federal election in the riding of Davenport, he was the youngest person ever elected to that point in the House of Commons of Canada. He served a brief stint as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of National Defence. He was then named Associate Minister of National Defence in the cabinet of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. This post was short-lived, though, as Hellyer lost his seat when the St. Laurent government lost the 1957 election two months later.

Hellyer returned to parliament in a 1958 by-election in the neighbouring riding of Trinity, and became an opposition critic of John Diefenbaker&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government.

==Cabinet minister and Liberal leadership candidate==
When the Liberals returned to power in the 1963 election, Hellyer became Minister of National Defence in the cabinet of Lester B. Pearson. This was the most significant period in Hellyer&#x27;s political career. As Minister of Defence, he oversaw the drastic and controversial integration and unification of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force into a single organization, the Canadian Forces.

Hellyer contested the 1968 Liberal leadership election, placing second on the first ballot, but slipped to third on the second and third ballots, and withdrew to support Robert Winters on the fourth ballot, in which Pierre Trudeau won the leadership. He served as Trudeau&#x27;s Transport Minister.

==Politics 1969–1988==
In 1969, Hellyer issued a major report on housing and urban renewal in which he advocated incremental reforms rather than new government programs. He called for greater flexibility in Canada&#x27;s mortgage loan system and encouraged corporate pension funds to invest more money in housing programs. His approach did not meet with universal acceptance. Some provincial and municipal governments were openly skeptical, and Heward Grafftey, a left-leaning Progressive Conservative (PC) with an interest in housing, called for a more radical approach.

The report also called for the suspension of the &quot;wholesale destruction of older housing&quot; and for &quot;greater selectivity [...] in the demolition of existing houses&quot;. Grand urban renewal projects would come to an end as a result of his Task Force. Hellyer resigned from the cabinet in 1969 after a dispute with Trudeau over the implementation of the housing program.

From 1971, Hellyer sat in Parliament as an independent, and after failing to form a new political party called Action Canada, he was invited by PC leader Robert Stanfield to join the PC caucus. He returned to prominence as an opposition critic and was re-elected in the 1972 election as a Progressive Conservative but lost his seat in the 1974 election.

Despite this loss, Hellyer contested the PC leadership election of 1976. His views were too right wing for most delegates, and he alienated many PCs with a speech attacking Red Tories as not being &quot;true conservatives&quot;. He finished a distant sixth of eight contestants on the second ballot; Joe Clark won the leadership.

Hellyer rejoined the Liberal Party in 1982 but remained mostly silent in politics. He contested the Liberal nomination in the Toronto riding of St. Paul&#x27;s in 1988, losing to Aideen Nicholson who had defeated Hellyer 14 years previously when a PC MP in the adjacent riding of Trinity.

Under Prime Minister Trudeau, Hellyer served as Canada&#x27;s only Senior Minister from April 1968 until resigning from the post in 1969.

==Canadian Action Party==
In 1997, Hellyer formed the Canadian Action Party (CAP) to provide voters with an economic nationalist option following the collapse of the National Party of Canada. Hellyer believed that both the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties were embracing globalization, and that the New Democratic Party was no longer able to provide a credible alternative. CAP also embraced Hellyer&#x27;s proposals for monetary reform: that the government should become more involved in the direction of the economy by gradually reducing the creation of private money and increasing the creation of public money from the current ratio of 5% public / 95% private back to 50% public and 50% private.

His party remained a little-noticed minor party, and Hellyer lost bids for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1997 and 2000 elections.

Following the 2000 election, and a resurgence for the New Democratic Party, Hellyer approached NDP leadership to discuss the possibility of merging the two parties into &#x27;One Big Party&#x27;. This process was furthered by the passage of a unanimous motion at the CAP&#x27;s convention in 2003.

In early 2004, after several extensions of the merger deadline, the NDP rejected Hellyer&#x27;s merger proposal which would have required the NDP to change its name. Hellyer resigned as CAP leader, but remained a member of the party. Rumours that he might run for the NDP in the 2004 election proved to be unfounded.

==Extraterrestrial intelligence claims==
On June 3, 1967, Hellyer inaugurated an unidentified flying object landing pad in St. Paul, Alberta. The pad was built as the town&#x27;s Canadian Centennial celebration project and as a symbol of keeping space free from human warfare.

In early September 2005, Hellyer made headlines by publicly announcing that he believed in the existence of UFOs. On September 25, 2005, he was a guest speaker at an exopolitics conference in Toronto, where he told the audience that he had seen a UFO one night with his late wife and some friends. The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; reported in 2007 that Hellyer was demanding world governments disclose alien technology that could be used to solve the problem of climate change. In an interview with RT (formerly Russia Today) in 2014, Hellyer said that at least four species of aliens had been visiting Earth for thousands of years, with most of them coming from other star systems, although there are some living on Venus, Mars and &quot;Saturn&#x27;s moon&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

Hellyer was one of the earliest investors in the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; in 1971. He served as a syndicated columnist for the newspaper between 1974 and 1984. He resided in Toronto and had three children and five grandchildren.

Hellyer died in Toronto on August 8, 2021 of complications from a fall, two days after his 98th birthday.

==Books==
Hellyer has written several books on Canada and globalization, including &quot;One Big Party: To Keep Canada Independent&quot;, in which he promoted the merger of the CAP, NDP, and various left-wing activists to save Canada from the effects of globalization, as well as possible annexation by the United States.

<doc id="396077" wikidata="Q1853367" url="?curid=396077" title="Virtua Tennis (video game)">
<text>Virtua Tennis, known in Japan as , is a 1999 tennis arcade game created by Sega. The player competes through tennis tournaments in an arcade mode. It was ported to the Dreamcast in 2000, and to Windows in 2002. A Game Boy Advance version was also released in 2002, followed by an N-Gage version in 2003. For the home console market, the game was expanded with the introduction of the campaign mode.

A sequel, &quot;Virtua Tennis 2&quot;, was released for arcades in 2001 and was ported to the Dreamcast the same year and to the PlayStation 2 in 2002. An updated version was released on the PlayStation Portable in 2005, under the name &quot;Virtua Tennis: World Tour&quot;. 2006 saw the release of &quot;Virtua Tennis 3&quot; for arcades (using the Sega Lindbergh hardware). Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and Windows versions were released in 2007. &quot;Virtua Tennis 2009&quot; was released in 2009 on the Windows, PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii platforms. &quot;Virtua Tennis 4&quot; was released in 2011 on the same four platforms, but also had an arcade version which was released later, as well as a PlayStation Vita port released in 2012. The latest addition to the franchise, &quot;Virtua Tennis Challenge&quot;, was released in 2012 on Android and iOS.

==Game modes==
===Arcade===
The player must win five matches played on different surfaces and venues to win a tournament. If the player performs well enough, he is challenged by Master, one of the game&#x27;s bosses.

===Exhibition===
This is a single match in which the options are customizable.

The match can be played as singles or doubles with up to four human players (two for singles). The duration can be varied between one game and one set. Other options include the court that the match is played on and the skill of the opponent(s).

===World Circuit===
Users have to win matches and complete training exercises in order to progress and unlock new ones. The user enters with a rank of 300th, which improves as matches are won. These matches are unlocked by completing easier matches or training exercises. The focus of the training exercises are to be fun, rather than realistic. Each exercise has three levels, with the difficulty increasing progressively. By completing the hardest difficulty with a certain amount of time left or points scored, an outfit is unlocked, which players can wear in all modes.

==Development==
&quot;Virtua Tennis&quot; was developed by Sega AM3. The producer, Mie Kumagai, wanted to create a game that appealed to broad demographics of players, taking note of the large number of one-on-one fighting games that proliferated throughout Japanese arcades during the 1990s. She also wished to replicate the critical and commercial achievements of Sega AM2&#x27;s soccer title &quot;Virtua Striker&quot;, which was directed by Satoshi Mifune and was a hit among a wide range of age groups. 
Kumagai began planning a game that could serve as a both a fun, casual experience and competitive, hardcore experience for people to play with friends and family in arcades and at home. Her initial proposal, a basketball game was rejected, while her alternative proposal, a tennis game, was accepted. However, the potential for the project&#x27;s success was still met with a large amount of skepticism within Sega. After Kumagai acquired a programmer, they made a trip to a tennis school for research, and began designing a unique paddle controller. By twisting this paddle, the user could switch between forehand and backhand shots, but after months of in-house experimentation it proved too difficult to operate. Taking advice from Mifune, the team simplified the controls to a more traditional joystick and buttons. User reception at location testing and in Sega&#x27;s offices proved to be very positive and development thereafter was smooth. Sega executives feared the game&#x27;s original Japanese title, &quot;Power Smash&quot;, would not translate well to overseas audiences. For its North American and European localizations, the name adopted the familiar &quot;Virtua&quot; label and was changed to &quot;Virtua Tennis&quot;.

==Reception==
The Dreamcast version received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, the Game Boy Advance version received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews, and the PC version received &quot;average&quot; reviews, while the N-Gage version received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Blake Fischer of &quot;NextGen&quot; called the Dreamcast version &quot;The best four-player game in a long time, and an excellent single- and two-player diversion. Don&#x27;t avoid this because it&#x27;s not football – you&#x27;ll get more playtime out of it than you think.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the same console version a score of 33 out of 40.

Also in Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their February 1, 2000 issue as the third most-successful arcade game of the previous year.

John Thompson of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave the same arcade version four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying: &quot;With an excellent engine, beautiful graphics and sounds, and an intuitive, deep gameplay system, &quot;Virtua Tennis&quot; is one of the best arcade games in recent memory. Sega dominated arcades of the late &#x27;90s, and with excellent titles such as this, it&#x27;s easy to see why.&quot; Bryan Melville, however, gave the Dreamcast version four stars, calling it &quot;a game that will go down as one of the best arcade ports on the 128-bit system.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; gave the same Dreamcast version eight out of ten, saying: &quot;Were it not for the irritation caused by the almost unbeatable players in later stages and the inability to play more than a single set per match, &quot;Virtua Tennis&quot; would have been a near-perfect sports game.&quot; The D-Pad Destroyer of &quot;GamePro&quot; called the same console version &quot;one of the most purely fun sports games in a long time, up there with &quot;Sega Bass Fishing&quot; in the Games You&#x27;re Embarrassed To Enjoy category. If you&#x27;re a sports fan, go get it.&quot; Four-Eyed Dragon said of the Game Boy Advance version: &quot;Even with sluggish controls and so-so visuals, &quot;Virtua Tennis&quot; still delivers, especially in the winning career mode where you train your custom-made athletes (both male and female) to become the number-one ranked in the world.&quot;

The Dreamcast version has been ranked in the top 100 games of all time by &quot;IGN&quot; both in 2005 (#91) and 2003 (#89). &quot;Game Informer&quot; placed the Dreamcast version 50th on their top 100 video games of all time in 2001. It was also featured in &quot;Guinness World Records 2017: Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; where it says that the Dreamcast version got GameRankings score of 91.37% based on 33 reviews.

The Dreamcast version was a runner-up for the &quot;Best Multiplayer Game&quot; and &quot;Best Sports Game (Traditional)&quot; awards at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2000 Awards, both of which went to &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and &quot;NFL 2K1&quot;, respectively. During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated the Dreamcast version for the &quot;Console Sports&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards; the first two went to &quot;SSX&quot;, while the latter went to &quot;Diablo II&quot;. Two years later, the Game Boy Advance version was also a runner-up for the website&#x27;s &quot;Best Sports Game on Game Boy Advance&quot; award, which went to &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;. The PC version was a runner-up for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″ &quot;2002 Best Sports Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003&quot;.

<text>Bernard-Germain-Étienne de La Ville-sur-Illon, comte de Lacépède or La Cépède (; 26 December 17566 October 1825) was a French naturalist and an active freemason. He is known for his contribution to the Comte de Buffon&#x27;s great work, the &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot;.

==Biography==

Lacépède was born at Agen in Guienne. His education was carefully conducted by his father, and the early perusal of Buffon&#x27;s Natural History (&quot;Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière&quot;) awakened his interest in that branch of study, which absorbed his chief attention. His leisure he devoted to music, in which, besides becoming a good performer on the piano and organ, he acquired considerable mastery of composition, two of his operas (which were never published) meeting with the high approval of Gluck; in 1781–1785 he also brought out in two volumes his &quot;Poétique de la musique&quot;.

Meantime he wrote two treatises, &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;électricité&quot; (1781) and &quot;Physique générale et particulière&quot; (1782–1784), which gained him the friendship of Buffon, who in 1785 appointed him subdemonstrator in the Jardin du Roi, and proposed that he continue Buffon&#x27;s &quot;Histoire naturelle&quot;. This continuation was published under the titles &quot;Histoire naturelle des quadrupèdes ovipares et des serpents&quot;. &quot;Tome premier&quot; (1788) and &quot;Histoire naturelle des &quot;serpents&quot;. Tome second&quot; (1789).

After the French Revolution Lacépède became a member of the Legislative Assembly, but during the Reign of Terror he left Paris, his life having become endangered by his disapproval of the massacres. When the Jardin du Roi was reorganised as the Jardin des Plantes and as the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in 1793, Lacépède was appointed to the chair allocated to the study of reptiles and fishes. In 1798, he published the first volume of &quot;Histoire naturelle des poissons&quot;, the fifth volume appearing in 1803, and in 1804 appeared his &quot;Histoire des cétacées&quot;. From this period until his death the part he took in politics prevented him making any further contribution of importance to science. In 1799, he became a senator, in 1801 president of the senate (a role he also fulfilled in 1807–08 and 1811–13), in 1803 grand chancellor of the Legion of Honor, in 1804 minister of state, and at the Bourbon Restoration in 1819 he was created a peer of France.

He died at Épinay-sur-Seine. During the latter part of his life he wrote &quot;Histoire générale physique et civile de l&#x27;Europe&quot;, published posthumously in 18 volumes, 1826.

He was elected perpetual secretary of the French Academy of Sciences at the Institute of France in 1796, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1806 and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1812.

Lacépède was initiated into freemasonry at 22 years old at Les Neuf Sœurs lodge in Paris, by Jérôme Lalande the worshipfull master himself, who wanted a naturalist for his prestigious lodge. In 1785, Lacépède created his own lodge : &quot;Les Frères Initiés&quot;. After the Revolution, he helped Cambacérès to rebuild a French freemasonry submitted to the Emperor, and joined &quot;Saint-Napoléon&quot; lodge where General Kellermann was worshipfull master. He finished his masonic life as dignitary of the Suprême Conseil de France.

==Evolution==

Lacépède was an early evolutionary thinker. He argued for the transmutation of species. He believed that species change over time and may go extinct from geological cataclysms or become &quot;metamorphosed&quot; into new species. In his book &quot;Histoire naturelle des poissons&quot;, he wrote:

&quot;The species can undergo such a large number of modifications in its forms and qualities, that without losing its vital capacity, it may be, by its latest conformation and properties, farther removed from its original state than from a different species: it is in that case metamorphosed into a new species.&quot;

== Tributes ==
* Lacepede Bay in South Australia, and the Lacepede Islands off the northern coast of Western Australia, are named after him.
* The street Rue Lacépède near the Jardin des Plantes and the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in Paris was named after him.
* A species of gecko endemic to Mauritius, &quot;Phelsuma cepediana&quot;, commonly known as the blue-tailed day gecko, is named in his honour.

<text>Guanosine-5&#x27;-triphosphate (GTP) is a purine nucleoside triphosphate. It is one of the building blocks needed for the synthesis of RNA during the transcription process. Its structure is similar to that of the guanosine nucleoside, the only difference being that nucleotides like GTP have phosphates on their ribose sugar. GTP has the guanine nucleobase attached to the 1&#x27; carbon of the ribose and it has the triphosphate moiety attached to ribose&#x27;s 5&#x27; carbon.

It also has the role of a source of energy or an activator of substrates in metabolic reactions, like that of ATP, but more specific. It is used as a source of energy for protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis.

GTP is essential to signal transduction, in particular with G-proteins, in second-messenger mechanisms where it is converted to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) through the action of GTPases.

==Uses==

===Energy transfer===
GTP is involved in energy transfer within the cell. For instance, a GTP molecule is generated by one of the enzymes in the citric acid cycle. This is tantamount to the generation of one molecule of ATP, since GTP is readily converted to ATP with nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDK).

===Genetic translation===
During the elongation stage of translation, GTP is used as an energy source for the binding of a new amino-bound tRNA to the A site of the ribosome. GTP is also used as an energy source for the translocation of the ribosome towards the 3&#x27; end of the mRNA.

===Microtubule dynamic instability===
During microtubule polymerization, each heterodimer formed by an alpha and a beta tubulin molecule carries two GTP molecules, and the GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP when the tubulin dimers are added to the plus end of the growing microtubule. Such GTP hydrolysis is not mandatory for microtubule formation, but it appears that only GDP-bound tubulin molecules are able to depolymerize. Thus, a GTP-bound tubulin serves as a cap at the tip of microtubule to protect from depolymerization; and, once the GTP is hydrolyzed, the microtubule begins to depolymerize and shrink rapidly.

===Mitochondrial function===
The translocation of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix involves the interactions of both GTP and ATP. The importing of these proteins plays an important role in several pathways regulated within the mitochondria organelle, such as converting oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in gluconeogenesis.

==Precursor for synthesis of riboflavin==
GTP, in combination with ribulose 5-phosphate, are the precursor compounds for the synthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2).

==Biosynthesis==

In the cell, GTP is synthesised through many processes including:
* as a byproduct of the Succinyl-CoA to Succinate conversion catalysed by the Succinyl-CoA synthetase enzyme as part of the Krebs cycle;
* through exchanges of phosphate groups from ATP molecules by the Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, an enzyme tasked with maintaining an equilibrium between the concentrations of different nucleoside triphosphates.
