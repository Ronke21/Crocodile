<text>The 1974 Super Outbreak was the second-largest tornado outbreak on record for a single 24-hour period, just behind the 2011 Super Outbreak. It was also one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in the United States, and the most violent tornado outbreak ever recorded, with 30 violent (F4 or F5 rated) tornadoes confirmed. From April 3–4, 1974, there were 148 tornadoes confirmed in 13 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Ontario. In the United States, the tornadoes struck Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and New York. The outbreak caused roughly $600 million USD (equivalent to $ in ) in damage. The outbreak extensively damaged approximately along a total combined path length of . At one point, as many as 15 separate tornadoes were occurring simultaneously.

The 1974 Super Outbreak was the first tornado outbreak in recorded history to produce more than 100 tornadoes in under a 24-hour period, a feat that was not repeated globally until the 1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak and in the United States until the 2011 Super Outbreak. In 2023, tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis created the outbreak intensity score (OIS) as a way to rank various tornado outbreaks. The 1974 Super Outbreak received an OIS of 578, making it the most intense tornado outbreak in recorded history.

==Meteorological synopsis==
A powerful springtime low pressure system developed across the North American Interior Plains on April 1. While moving into the Mississippi and Ohio Valley areas, a surge of unusually moist air intensified the storm further, while there were sharp temperature contrasts between both sides of the system. Officials at NOAA and in the National Weather Service forecast offices were expecting a severe weather outbreak on April 3, but not to the extent that ultimately occurred. Several F2 and F3 tornadoes had struck portions of the Ohio Valley and the South in a separate, earlier outbreak on April 1 and 2, which included three killer tornadoes in Kentucky, Alabama, and Tennessee. The town of Campbellsburg, northeast of Louisville, was hard-hit in this earlier outbreak, with a large portion of the town destroyed by an F3. Between the two outbreaks, an additional tornado was reported in Indiana in the early morning hours of April 3, several hours before the official start of the outbreak. On Wednesday, April 3, severe weather watches already were issued from the morning from south of the Great Lakes, while in portions of the Upper Midwest, snow was reported, with heavy rain falling across central Michigan and much of Ontario.
By 12:00 UTC on April 3, a large-scale trough extended over most of the contiguous United States, with several modest shortwaves rotating around the broad base of the trough. The mid-latitude low-pressure center over Kansas continued to deepen to , and wind speeds at the 850-mb level increased to () over portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Due to significant moisture advection, destabilization rapidly proceeded apace; the warm front near the Gulf Coast dissipated and then redeveloped northward over the Ohio River valley. Consequently, CAPE levels in the region rose to 1,000 J/kg. However, a warm temperature plume in the elevated mixed layer kept thunderstorms from initiating at the surface. Meanwhile, a large mesoscale convective system (MCS) that had developed overnight in Arkansas continued to strengthen due to strong environmental lapse rates. Later in the day, strong daytime heating caused instability to further rise. By 18:00 UTC, CAPE values in excess of 2,500 J/kg were present over the lower Ohio and the Mississippi Valley. As wind speeds in the troposphere increased, Large-scale lifting overspread the warm sector. At the same time, the forward-propagating MCS spread into the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, where it evolved into the first of three main convection bands that produced tornadoes. This first convective band moved rapidly northeast, at times reaching speeds of about (). However, thunderstorm activity, for the moment, remained mostly elevated in nature.
By 16:30 UTC, the large MCS began to splinter into two sections: the southern part slowed, lagging into southeast Tennessee, while the northern part accelerated, reaching Pennsylvania by 19:30 UTC. The split was related to several factors, including a band of subsidence over eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia; local downslope winds over the Appalachians; and an inversion over the same area. These factors allowed the northern part of the MCS to accelerate due to efficient ducting, while the southern part slowed as the boundary layer warmed and moistened. Numerous surface-based supercells began to develop in the southern area, beginning with one that produced an F3 tornado at about 16:30 UTC near Cleveland, Tennessee. Meanwhile, a new band of scattered thunderstorms developed at 15:00 UTC over eastern Arkansas and Missouri; over the next four hours, this band became the focus for several intense supercells, starting in eastern Illinois and southern Indiana. In the wake of the MCS, backing low-level winds, rapid diurnal destabilization, and perhaps cool, mid-level advection had occurred over the warm sector, weakening the convective inhibition (CINH) layer, and favorable wind profiles bolstered helicity to over 230 m2/s²—a combination of factors conducive to tornadogenesis. Consequently, the storms increased in intensity and coverage as they moved into Illinois, Indiana, and northern Kentucky, producing several tornadoes, including the first F5 tornado of the day, at 19:20 UTC, near Depauw, Indiana. Several of the storms to form between 19:20 and 20:20 UTC became significant, long-lived supercells, producing many strong or violent tornadoes, including three F5s at Depauw; Xenia, Ohio; and Brandenburg, Kentucky. These storms formed the second of three convective bands to generate tornadoes.

While violent tornado activity increased over the warm sector, a third band of convection developed at about 16:00 UTC and extended from near St. Louis into west-central Illinois. Based upon real-time satellite imagery and model data, differential positive vorticity advection coincided with the left exit region of an upper-level jet streak which reached wind speeds of up to (), thereby enhancing thunderstorm growth. Storms grew rapidly in height and extent, producing baseball-sized hail by 17:20 UTC in Illinois and, shortly thereafter, in St. Louis, Missouri, which reported a very severe thunderstorm early in the afternoon that, while not producing a tornado, was the costliest storm to hit the city up to that time. By 19:50 UTC, supercells producing F3 tornadoes hit the Decatur and Normal areas in Illinois. As thunderstorms moved into the warmer, moister air mass over eastern Illinois and Indiana, they produced longer-lived tornadoes—one of which began near Otterbein and ended near Valentine in Indiana, a distance of .

Meanwhile, by 00:00 UTC the southern half of the first convective band became indistinguishable from new convection that had formed farther south over Alabama and Tennessee in connection with convective band two. In this area, increasing west-southwesterly wind shear at all levels of the troposphere, juxtaposed over near-parallel outflow boundaries, allowed successive supercells, all producing strong, long-tracked tornadoes, to develop unconstrained by their outflow in a broad region from eastern Mississippi to southern Tennessee. These storms, forming after 23:00 UTC, produced some of the most powerful tornadoes of the outbreak, including a large and long-tracked F4 that struck the western and central portions of Alabama, tracking for just over , two F5s that both slammed into Tanner, causing extensive fatalities, an extremely potent F5 that devastated Guin in Alabama, and multiple violent, deadly tornadoes that affected and caused fatalities in Tennessee.

Michigan was not hit as hard as neighboring states or Windsor, with only one deadly tornado that hit near Coldwater and Hillsdale, killing people in mobile homes; however, thunderstorm downpours caused flash floods, and north of the warm front in the Upper Peninsula, heavy snowfall was reported. Activity in the south moved towards the Appalachians during the overnight hours and produced the final tornadoes across the southeast during the morning of April 4. A series of studies by Dr. Tetsuya T. Fujita in 1974–75—which were later cited in a 2004 survey by Risk Management Solutions—found that three-quarters of all tornadoes in the 1974 Super Outbreak were produced by 30 &#x27;families&#x27; of tornadoes—multiple tornadoes spawned in succession by a single thunderstorm cell. The majority of these were long-lived and long-tracked individual supercells.
==Confirmed tornadoes==

*Note: An F3 tornado was confirmed in Ontario.
This tornado outbreak produced the most violent (F4 and F5) tornadoes ever observed in a single tornado outbreak. There were seven F5 tornadoes and 23 F4 tornadoes. More than 100 tornadoes associated with 33 tornado families. The first tornado of the outbreak is disputed, with some sources indicating an isolated F2 in Indiana at 13:30 UTC while Fujita marked the outbreak&#x27;s onset at 18:10 UTC with an F0 in Illinois. As the storm system moved east where daytime heating had made the air more unstable, the tornadoes grew more intense. A tornado that struck near Monticello, Indiana was an F4 and had a path length of , the longest path length of any tornado for this outbreak. A total of 19 people were killed in this tornado. The first F5 tornado of the day struck the city of Depauw, Indiana, at 3:20 pm EDT. It killed 6 and injured 86 others along its 65-mile path, leveling and sweeping away homes in Depauw and Daisy Hill.

Seven F5 tornadoes were observed—one each in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, three in Alabama and the final one which crossed through parts of Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Thirty-one people were killed in Brandenburg, Kentucky, and 28 died in Guin, Alabama. An F3 tornado also occurred in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, killing nine and injuring 30 others there, all of them at the former Windsor Curling Club.

There were 18 hours of nearly continuous tornado activity that ended in Caldwell County, North Carolina, at about 7:00 am on April 4. A total of 319 were killed in 148 tornadoes from April 3 through April 4 and 5,484 were injured.

The 1974 Super Outbreak occurred at the end of a very strong, nearly record-setting La Niña event. The 1973–74 La Niña was just as strong as the 1998–99 La Niña. Despite the apparent connection between La Niña and two of the largest tornado outbreaks in United States history, no definitive linkage exists between La Niña and this outbreak or tornado activity in general. Some tornado myths were soundly debunked (not necessarily for the first time) by tornado activity during the outbreak.

===Depauw–Daisy Hill, Indiana===

Of the F5 tornadoes produced by the outbreak, the Depauw-Daisy Hill tornado was the first to form, touching down at 3:20 pm local time. It is probably the least-known of the F5 tornadoes in the outbreak as it traveled through rural areas in southern Indiana northwest of Louisville, traversing about through parts of Perry and Harrison Counties. F5 damage was observed near the community of Depauw, where numerous farms were leveled. Areas near Palmyra and Borden were also heavily affected by the tornado. Morgan Elementary School in northern Harrison County Indiana was directly hit by the tornado. Four classrooms were destroyed and the roof was removed from the school and placed on the cars of the faculty. Fortunately, the children and faculty, who were huddled in the hallways, were not injured. All but 10 homes in Martinsburg were destroyed; and in the Daisy Hill community homes were completely swept away at F5 intensity. Published photographs of this storm reveal a very wide debris cloud and wall cloud structure, with no visible condensation funnel at times. Overall, six were killed by the storm and 86 were injured. One of the fatalities occurred when a woman was crushed by a school bus that flew into a ditch she was sheltering in. The tornado had a peak width of .
===Xenia, Ohio===


The tornado that struck the city of Xenia, Ohio stands as the deadliest individual tornado of the 1974 Super Outbreak, killing 32 people and destroying a significant portion of the town. The tornado formed near Bellbrook, Ohio, southwest of Xenia, at about 4:30 pm EDT. It began as a moderate-sized tornado, then intensified while moving northeast at about . The tornado exhibited a multiple-vortex structure and became very large as it approached town. The massive tornado slammed into the western part of Xenia, completely flattening the Windsor Park and Arrowhead subdivisions at F5 intensity, and sweeping away entire rows of brick homes with little debris left behind in some areas. Extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred in nearby fields.

When the storm reached central Xenia at 4:40 pm, apartment buildings, homes, businesses, churches, and schools including Xenia High School were destroyed. Students in the school, practicing for a play, took cover in the main hallway seconds before the tornado dropped a school bus onto the stage where they had been practicing and extensively damaged the school building. Several railroad cars were lifted and blown over as the tornado passed over a moving Penn Central freight train in the center of town. It toppled headstones in Cherry Grove Cemetery, then moved through the length of the downtown business district, passing west of the courthouse (which sustained some exterior damage). Numerous businesses in downtown Xenia were heavily damaged or destroyed, and several people were killed at the A&amp;W Root Beer stand as the building was flattened. Upon exiting Xenia, the tornado passed through Wilberforce, heavily damaging several campus and residential buildings of Wilberforce University. Central State University also sustained considerable damage, and a water tower there was toppled. Afterwards, the tornado weakened before dissipating in Clark County near South Vienna, traveling a little over .

A total of 32 people lost their lives in the tornado, and about 1,150 were injured in Xenia, several of whom took proper shelter. In addition to the direct fatalities, two Ohio Air National Guardsmen deployed for disaster assistance were killed on April 17 when a fire swept through their temporary barracks in a furniture store. The memorial in downtown Xenia lists 34 deaths, in honor of the two Guardsmen. About 1,400 buildings (roughly half of the town) were heavily damaged or destroyed. Damage was estimated at US$100 million ($471.7 million in 2013 dollars).

Dr. Ted Fujita and a team of colleagues undertook a 10-month study of the 1974 Super Outbreak. Fujita initially assigned the Xenia tornado a preliminary rating of F6 intensity ± 1 scale, before deeming F6 ratings &quot;inconceivable&quot;.
===Monticello tornado family===

The most prolific and longest-lasting tornado family of the outbreak tracked from central Illinois and the entirety of northern Indiana from 2:47 p.m. – 6:59 p.m. (UTC−05:00), a span of 4 hours and 12 minutes. Eight tornadoes touched down, including the longest-tracked single tornado of the outbreak: the F4 Monticello tornado. However, that tornado may itself have been composed of three individual F4 tornadoes.
====Otterbein–Monticello–Wolcottville, Indiana====


This half-mile (0.8 km) wide F4 tornado developed (as part of a tornado family that moved from Illinois to Michigan for 260 miles) during the late afternoon hours. This tornado produced the longest damage path recorded during the 1974 Super Outbreak, on a southwest to northeast path that nearly crossed the entire state of Indiana. According to most records (including the presented map of north Indiana), this tornado formed just southwest of Otterbein in northeast Warren County in west central Indiana, and ended in LaGrange County just northwest of Valentine – a total distance of about . Further analysis by Ted Fujita indicated that at the start of the tornado path near Otterbein, downburst winds (also called &quot;twisting downburst&quot;) disrupted the tornado&#x27;s inflow which caused it to briefly dissipate before redeveloping near Brookston in White County at around 4:50 pm EDT and then traveled for . It also struck portions of six other counties, with the hardest hit being White County and its town of Monticello. Much of the town was destroyed including the courthouse, some churches and cemeteries, 40 businesses and numerous homes as well as three schools. It also heavily damaged the Penn Central bridge over the Tippecanoe River. Overall damage according to the NOAA was estimated at US$250 million with US$100 million damage in Monticello alone.

After the tornado struck Monticello, the tornado reached peak strength and completely leveled several farms northwest of town. The tornado then went on to tear through the west side of Rochester, where businesses were destroyed and homes were completely leveled and swept away. Riddle Elementary School was badly damaged as well. The tornado then struck Talma, destroying most of the town, including a fastening plant and the schoolhouse. The tornado continued northeast and struck the south sides of Atwood and Leesburg, with additional severe damage occurring at both locations. The tornado then crossed Dewart Lake and Lake Wawasee, destroying multiple lakeside homes and trailers. The Wawasee Airport was hard hit, where hangars were destroyed and planes were thrown and demolished. The tornado destroyed several buildings as it passed between Ligonier and Topeka, including Perry School and a Monsanto plant. Train cars near the plant were blown off the tracks and thrown into the building. The tornado then finally dissipated near Oliver Lake airfield.

A total of 18 people were killed during the storm including five people from Fort Wayne when their mini-bus fell into the Tippecanoe River near Monticello. One passenger did survive the fall. Five others were killed in White County, six in Fulton County and one in Kosciusko County. The National Guard had assisted the residents in the relief and cleanup efforts and then-Governor Otis Bowen visited the area days after the storm. One of the few consolations from the tornado was that a century-old bronze bell that belonged to the White County Courthouse and served as timekeeper was found intact despite being thrown a great distance. The tornado itself had contradicted a long-time myth that a tornado would &quot;not follow terrain into steep valleys&quot; as while hitting Monticello, it descended a hill near the Tippecanoe River and heavily damaged several homes immediately afterwards.
===Hanover/Madison, Indiana===


Soon after the Depauw tornado lifted, the Hanover/Madison F4 tornado formed near Henryville and traveled through Jefferson County and leveled many structures in the small towns of Hanover and Madison. A total of 11 people were killed in this storm while an additional 300 were injured. According to a WHAS-TV Louisville reporter in a special report about the outbreak, 90% of Hanover was destroyed or severely damaged, including the Hanover College campus. Despite the fact that no one was killed or seriously injured at the college, 32 of the college&#x27;s 33 buildings were damaged, including two that were completely destroyed and six that sustained major structural damage. Hundreds of trees were down, completely blocking every campus road. All utilities were knocked out and communication with those off campus was nearly impossible. Damage to the campus alone was estimated at US$10 million. In Madison alone, where seven of the fatalities took place, about 300 homes were destroyed. The tornado also brushed the community of China causing additional fatalities.

The same storm would later strike the Cincinnati area, producing multiple tornadoes, including another F5 tornado.
===Brandenburg, Kentucky===

The Brandenburg tornado, which produced F5 damage and took 31 lives, touched down in Breckinridge County around 3:25 pm CDT and followed a path. The tornado first moved across the north edge of Hardinsburg, inflicting F3 damage to homes at that location. The tornado quickly became violent as it moved into Meade County, producing F4 damage as it passed north of Irvington, sweeping away numerous homes in this rural area. Vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from residences and mangled, and a few were completely wrapped around trees. One home that was swept away sustained total collapse of a poured concrete walk-out basement wall. A news photographer reported that the tornado &quot;left no grass&quot; as it crossed KY 79 in this area, and canceled checks from near Irvington were later found in Ohio. Past Irvington, the tornado tore directly through Brandenburg at F5 intensity, completely leveling and sweeping away numerous homes, some of which were well-built and anchor-bolted. The town&#x27;s downtown area was also devastated with 18 of the fatalities occurring along Green Street alone. Trees and shrubbery in town were debarked and stripped, extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred, and numerous vehicles were destroyed as well, some of which had nothing left but the frame and tires. A curtain rod was found speared deeply into the trunk of one tree in town. Several tombstones in the Cap Anderson cemetery were toppled and broken, and some were displaced a small distance. Exiting Brandenburg, the tornado crossed into Indiana producing F4 damage there before dissipating. The same storm would later produce tornadoes in the Louisville metro area.

When the tornado struck on April 3, 1974, many of the Brandenburg residents at that time had also experienced a major flood of the Ohio River that affected the area in 1937 as well as numerous other communities along the river, including Louisville and Paducah. The Brandenburg tornado is the only tornado to have officially produced documented F5/EF5 damage in the state of Kentucky, with the 1971 Gosser Ridge, Kentucky tornado being rated F5 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, before being downgraded to F4 after 2000.
===Cincinnati/Sayler Park, Ohio===


The Sayler Park tornado was among a series of tornadoes that earlier struck portions of southern Indiana from north of Brandenburg, Kentucky, into southwest Ohio. This tornado was witnessed on television by thousands of people, as WCPO aired the tornado live during special news coverage of the tornadoes. It was also noted for the rarity in that its path was in parts of three states. It began shortly before 4:30 pm CDT or 5:30 pm EDT in southeastern Indiana in Ohio County north of Rising Sun near the Ohio River. It then traveled through Boone County, Kentucky, producing F4 damage in the Taylorsport area before crossing the Ohio River a second time into Ohio. Here, the tornado reached F5 intensity as it slammed into Sayler Park. The first area of town hit was the Morehead Marina, where numerous boats were thrown and destroyed. A large floating restaurant barge at this location was lifted, ripped from its moorings, and flipped by the tornado. It was later recovered several miles downstream. A nearby house was lifted from its foundation and thrown into the river. At a further inland area of Sayler Park, the tornado maintained F5 intensity as numerous homes were swept away at a hilly area near a lake, with only bare slabs remaining. NWS surveyors noted that a pickup truck in this area was carried a half block over the roofs of five homes before being smashed to the ground. The tornado weakened somewhat as it continued northeastward, passing through multiple Cincinnati neighborhoods and destroying numerous homes. Some of the worst affected areas were Bridgetown, Mack, Dent and Delhi. Damage in Delhi was rated as high as F4. The tornado took three lives and injured 210 with 190 of the injuries were in Hamilton County, Ohio alone. It was considered the most-photographed tornado of the outbreak.

This tornado dissipated west of White Oak, but the same thunderstorm activity was responsible for two other tornado touchdowns in the Lebanon and Mason areas. The Mason tornado, which started in the northern Cincinnati subdivisions of Arlington Heights and Elmwood Place, was rated F4 and took two lives, while the Warren County tornado was rated an F2 and injured 10.
===Louisville, Kentucky===


About an hour after the Brandenburg tornado, the same supercell spawned an F4 tornado that formed in the southwest part of Jefferson County near Kosmosdale. Another funnel cloud formed over Standiford Field Airport, touched down at The Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center, and destroyed the majority of the horse barns at the center and part of Freedom Hall (a multipurpose arena) before it crossed I-65, scattering several vehicles on that busy expressway. The tornado continued its journey northeast where it demolished most of Audubon Elementary School and affected the neighborhoods of Audubon, Cherokee Triangle, Cherokee-Seneca, Crescent Hill, Indian Hills, Northfield, Rolling Fields, and Tyler Park. Numerous homes were destroyed in residential areas, including a few that were leveled. The tornado ended near the junction of Interstates 264 and 71 after killing three people, injuring 207 people, destroying over 900 homes, and damaging thousands of others. Cherokee Park, a historic municipal park located at Eastern Parkway and Cherokee Road, had thousands of mature trees destroyed. A massive re-planting effort was undertaken by the community in the aftermath of the tornado.

Dick Gilbert, a helicopter traffic reporter for radio station WHAS-AM, followed the tornado through portions of its track including when it heavily damaged the Louisville Water Company&#x27;s Crescent Hill pumping station, and gave vivid descriptions of the damage as seen from the air. A WHAS-TV cameraman also filmed the tornado when it passed just east of the Central Business District of Louisville.

WHAS-AM broke away from its regular programming shortly before the tornado struck Louisville and was on-air live with John Burke, the chief meteorologist at the National Weather Service&#x27;s Louisville office at Standiford Field when the tornado first descended. The station remained on the air delivering weather bulletins and storm-related information until well into the early morning hours of April 4. As electrical power had been knocked out to a substantial portion of the city, the radio station became a clearinghouse for vital information and contact with emergency workers, not only in Louisville but across the state of Kentucky due to its 50,000-watt clear-channel signal and the fact that storms had knocked numerous broadcasting stations in smaller communities, such as Frankfort, off the air. Then-Governor Wendell Ford commended the station&#x27;s personnel for their service to the community in the time of crisis, and Dick Gilbert later received a special commendation from then-President Richard Nixon for his tracking of the tornado from his helicopter.
===Tanner, Alabama (1st tornado)===

As the cluster of thunderstorms was crossing much of the Ohio Valley and northern Indiana, additional strong storms developed much further south just east of the Mississippi River into the Tennessee Valley and Mississippi. It produced the first deadly tornadoes in Alabama during the early evening hours. Most of the small town of Tanner, located to the west of Huntsville and south of the Limestone County seat of Athens, was destroyed when two F5 tornadoes struck the community 30 minutes apart.

The first tornado formed at 6:30 pm CDT in Lawrence County, Alabama and ended 73 minutes later in Madison County, Alabama, killing 28 people. The tornado first touched down near the small community of Mt. Hope, and then tracked into Mt. Moriah, where the tornado rapidly intensified and swept away homes and hurled fleeing vehicles, and where a family of six were killed. Further along the track, many homes were swept away near Moulton. A water pump was completely lifted out of a wellhouse along SR 157 in this area. In one case, the destruction was so complete that a witness reported that the largest recognizable objects among scattered debris from an obliterated house were some bed-springs. The tornado crossed into Morgan County, causing additional destruction in rural areas near Hillsboro and Trinity. Crossing the Tennessee River into Limestone County as a large waterspout, the tornado flattened a ¾-mile–wide swath of trees on the opposite bank. Ground scouring occurred in this area, as reddish soil was dug up and plastered against trees. The storm then slammed into Tanner, where many homes were swept away, vehicles were tossed, shrubbery was debarked, and Lawson&#x27;s Trailer Park sustained major damage. The tornado then continued into Madison County and struck the Capshaw and Harvest areas. Numerous homes in Harvest and surrounding rural areas of the county were swept completely away and scattered, and extensive wind-rowing of debris was noted. A bathtub from one residence was found deeply embedded into the ground. Past Harvest, the tornado abruptly dissipated northeast of town, having a peak width of 500 yards.
===Jasper/Cullman, Alabama===


While tornadoes were causing devastation in the northwesternmost corner of the state, another supercell crossing the Mississippi-Alabama state line produced another violent tornado that touched down in Pickens County before heading northeast for nearly 2 hours towards the Jasper area causing major damage to its downtown as the F4 storm struck. Damage was reported in Cullman from the storm before it lifted.

The Jasper tornado first touched near Aliceville, producing scattered damage as it tracked northeastward. The damage became more intense and continuous as the tornado entered Tuscaloosa County. The tornado continued to strengthen south of Berry, and two people were killed near the Walker County line when a church was destroyed. The tornado tore directly through downtown Jasper at 6:57 PM, resulting in severe damage and at least 100 injuries. Numerous buildings and storefronts were heavily damaged in downtown Jasper, and many streets were blocked with trees and power lines. The Walker County courthouse sustained major damage, and a new fire station was completely leveled. The fireman on duty at the time took shelter in a nearby large culvert, and survived without injury. The Walker County Library and the Jasper First Methodist Church were also damaged. The tornado crossed Lewis Smith Lake and moved across the south side of Cullman at 7:40 pm. Multiple homes and shopping centers were damaged or destroyed in the area, resulting in one death and 36 injuries. The tornado finally dissipated northeast of Cullman a short time later.

In total, the storm took three lives, but injured one hundred and fifty residents of Jasper or Cullman. Five hundred buildings were destroyed, with nearly four hundred other buildings severely damaged. At the same time, a third supercell was crossing the state line near the track of the previous two.
===Tanner, Alabama (2nd tornado)===

While rescue efforts were underway to look for people under the destroyed structures, few were aware that another violent tornado would strike the area. The path of the second tornado, which formed at 7:35 pm CDT was 83 miles in length, also had a peak width of 500 yards, and the storm formed along the north bank Tennessee River less than a mile from the path of the earlier storm; with much of its path very closely paralleling its predecessor as it tore through Limestone and Madison Counties. 16 people were killed by this second tornado. Tanner was the first community to be hit, and many structures that were left standing after the first tornado were destroyed in the second one. A man injured at Lawson&#x27;s Trailer Park in the first tornado was taken to a church in the area, which collapsed in the second tornado, killing him.

After devastating what was left of Tanner, the tornado continued across rural Limestone County and into Madison County, where the communities of Capshaw and Harvest were devastated once again. Numerous homes throughout Madison County were swept completely away, with extensive wind-rowing of debris noted once again. Past Harvest, the tornado swept away multiple additional homes in the Hazel Green area. The tornado continued northeastward through rural portions of Madison County before crossing into Tennessee, where major damage and 6 deaths occurred in Franklin and Lincoln Counties before the tornado dissipated in Coffee County. Two of the fatalities in Tennessee occurred when a church was destroyed during service. The death toll from the two tornadoes was over 45 and over 400 were injured. Most of the fatalities occurred in and around the Tanner area. Over 1,000 houses, 200 mobile homes and numerous other outbuildings, automobiles, power lines and trees were completely demolished or heavily damaged. The most recent official National Weather Service records show that both of the Tanner tornadoes were rated F5. However, the rating of the second Tanner tornado is still disputed by some scientists; analysis in one publication estimates F3-F4 damage along the entirety of the second storm&#x27;s path. This was the second state to have been hit by more than two F5 tornadoes during the 1974 Super Outbreak. 
===Guin, Alabama===


The fast-moving nighttime tornado that devastated the town of Guin, was the longest-duration F5 tornado recorded in the outbreak, and considered to be one of the most violent ever recorded. The Guin Tornado traveled over , from the town of Vernon, Alabama, to just south of the small town of Basham, before lifting just after 10:30 pm CDT. It formed at around 8:50 pm CDT near the Mississippi-Alabama border, north of the town of Vernon, striking the Monterey Trailer Park, resulting in major damage at that location. The tornado then became violent as it approached and entered Guin, with multiple areas of F5 damage noted in and around town. The tornado first struck the Guin Mobile Home Plant as it entered the town, completely obliterating the structure. Nothing was left of the plant but a pile of mangled steel beams, and its foundation was partially pushed clean of debris. The town&#x27;s downtown area was also heavily damaged, with many brick businesses and two churches completely destroyed. Trees in town were debarked, ground scouring occurred, and vehicles were thrown and mangled as well. Residential areas in Guin suffered total devastation, with many homes swept completely away and scattered across fields. According to NWS damage surveyor Bill Herman, the damage in one 6-block area was particularly extreme, and remarked that &quot;It was just like the ground had been swept clean. It was just as much of a total wipeout as you can have.&quot; Surveyor J.B. Elliot noted that the destruction was so complete, that even some of the foundations were &quot;dislodged, and in some cases swept away.&quot; A total of 23 people were killed in Guin.

The tornado continued past Guin and struck the small community of Twin, destroying numerous homes, mobile homes, and businesses at that location, though the damage was less intense than that observed in Guin. Crossing into Winston County, the tornado struck the small community of Delmar, destroying additional homes and killing 5 people. Mobile homes in Delmar were obliterated, with their frames wrapped around trees. Past Delmar, the tornado grew up to a mile wide as it tore through the William B. Bankhead National Forest, flattening a huge swath of trees. Surveyors noted that timber damage was equally severe at all elevations in this area, with numerous trees snapped both along exposed ridges and in deep gorges. So many trees were snapped in this area that the tornado path was visible from satellite. The tornado finally dissipated south of Basham after destroying 546 structures. The same supercell then re-strengthened and produced a new tornado just south of the town of Decatur. The Guin tornado was originally believed by Fujita to have had a long path, that went all the way from Vernon, to the small town of Hytop, just a few miles south of the Tennessee state line. However, the section of the original path, from Decatur to Hytop, was determined later to be from the F3 tornado listed below.
===Huntsville, Alabama===


Huntsville was affected shortly before 11:00 pm EDT by a strong F3 tornado produced by the same thunderstorm that produced the Guin tornado. This tornado produced heavy damage in the south end of the city, eventually damaging or destroying nearly 1,000 structures.

The tornado touched down north of Hartselle and moved northeast toward Huntsville. It first hit the Redstone Arsenal, damaging or destroying numerous buildings at that location. But thanks to early warning from an MP picket line on Rideout Road (now Research Park Boulevard (SR 255)), there were only seven, relatively minor, injuries. One of the buildings destroyed was a publications center for the Nuclear Weapons Training School on the Arsenal. For months afterwards, portions of classified documents were being returned by farmers in Tennessee and Alabama. Many homes were badly damaged or destroyed as the tornado passed through residential areas of the city, and a school was destroyed as well. Many businesses were also heavily damaged, and numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the city. The Glenn&#x27;ll trailer park was completely destroyed by the tornado, and some sources list a fatality occurring at that location. The tornado then reached Monte Sano Mountain, which has an elevation of , where additional homes were torn apart. The National Weather Service office at Huntsville Jetplex was briefly &quot;closed and abandoned&quot; due to the severe weather conditions. The tornado eventually dissipated near Jacobs Mountain. Remarkable electrical phenomenon was reported as the tornado passed through Huntsville, with reports of luminous clouds, ball lightning, and multi-colored flashes and glowing areas in the sky as the storm moved through the city. These aforementioned flashes were more than likely Power Flashes, which are flashes of light caused by arcing electrical discharges from damaged electrical equipment, most often severed power lines.
==Non-tornadic effects==
Severe thunderstorms on April 4 brought of rain to tornado-stricken areas of northwest Georgia. Flash floods were considered a major risk in the region&#x27;s mountainous terrain.

In Alderson, West Virginia, &quot;tornado-like winds&quot; caused extensive damage to homes and businesses primarily along WV 3, some of which had their roof torn off. Many trees and power lines were downed leaving more than 7,000 people without electricity.

==Aftermath==

On April 5, Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter declared 13 counties as disaster areas and put in a request to President Nixon for federal aid, citing damage in excess of $15.5 million. Service centers were opened at two National Guard Armories, one in Dalton and the other in Calhoun, as well as a church in Dawsonville. The National Guard provided four-wheel drive vehicles for search and rescue efforts.

West Virginia Governor Moore declared 14 counties as disaster areas by April 5 and requested the assistance of the National Guard. President Nixon approved federal aid for Fayette, Greenbriar, Raleigh, and Wyoming Counties on April 11. Total damage from the tornadoes and thunderstorms in the state reached $3,655,000, more than half of which was incurred by Raleigh County. The West Virginia State Department of Highways provided two water trucks. The local Red Cross provided $3,000 to victims in Fayette County and assisted residents with acquiring supplies and dealing with medical bills. Sightseers traveling to look at the damage clogged up roadways. The Federal Disaster Assistance Administration (later FEMA) indicated that trailers refurbished after the 1972 Buffalo Creek flood would be used to house displaced persons.

On April 10, voting on the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 was expedited and passed unanimously in the United States Senate in direct response to the scale of damage from the tornado outbreak. The primary purpose of the act was to overhaul how disasters are handled on a federal level and to make acquiring federal aid easier. Notably, it would prompt the creation of a disaster-coordinating agency. President Nixon signed it into federal law on May 22.

<doc id="402978" wikidata="Q1015021" url="?curid=402978" title="Hyannis, Massachusetts">
<text>Hyannis is the largest of the seven villages in the town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, United States. It is the commercial and transportation hub of Cape Cod and was designated an urban area at the 1990 census. Because of this, many refer to Hyannis as the &quot;Capital of the Cape&quot;. It contains a majority of the Barnstable Town offices and two important shopping districts: the historic downtown Main Street and the Route 132 Commercial District, including Cape Cod Mall and Independence Park, headquarters of Cape Cod Potato Chips. Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis is the largest on Cape Cod.

Hyannis is a major tourist destination and the primary ferry boat and general aviation link for passengers and freight to Nantucket Island. Hyannis also provides secondary passenger access to the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, with the primary passenger access to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard being located in Woods Hole, a village in the nearby town of Falmouth. Due to its large natural harbor, Hyannis is the largest recreational boating and second largest commercial fishing port on Cape Cod, behind only Provincetown.

The village is the namesake of the former United States Naval ship .

==History==
The village was named after Iyannough, a sachem of the Cummaquid tribe.

==Climate==
Hyannis has an ocean-moderated humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; under Köppen), which is close to an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb).&quot; Summers are even closer to &quot;Dfa&quot;, or &quot;Cfa&quot;, a humid subtropical climate, under 1991 to 2020 normals.

==Drinking water==
In 2007, the city water was found to contain perchlorate.
In 2009, Barnstable public works requested that the fire academy cease their operations. In 2010, Well MD2 had been shut down &quot;until contamination issues caused by the Fire Training Academy [were] addressed&quot;.

In April 2015, the town&#x27;s Mary Dunn wellfield near a fire training academy was found to be contaminated with perfluorooctane sulfonate, and well use was suspended until costly emergency filtration with two carbon treatment units could be started. Two wells, at Hyannisport and West Hyannisport, were closed.

A six-month overland interconnection with Yarmouth&#x27;s water system was suggested in May and constructed in June 2015. In November 2015, the county suspended the Barnstable County Fire and Rescue Training Academy which is up gradient of the wells. but in February 2016, it still remained open.

In May 2016, the City of Barnstable issued a drinking water health advisory, for PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) of 0.18 parts per billion in the Mary Dunn #3 well, which was taken offline.

==Demographics==
In 2010, Hyannis had a total population of 14,089, living in 8,406 households. 19.80% of Hyannis&#x27; total 10,922 housing units were seasonally vacant. Hyannis had relatively more multi-family properties in comparison to the town and the county. Hyannis had an owner-occupancy rate of 58.3%, which was nearly 20 percentage points lower than the town or the county. This difference is associated primarily with the number of apartment properties in the village. A decline in younger, family formation households was attributed to the lack of suitable employment opportunities and &quot;affordable&quot; housing. The median value of owner-occupied housing units in Hyannis in 2000 was $149,720. The gross median rent in Hyannis was $718/month. In 2002, the median price for a single family home in Hyannis was $196,000.

Median head of household income was $38,467. 15.9% of households earned more than $75,000. 14.6% of Hyannis population lived below the poverty line. 18.74% were over 65 years old. Unemployment in Hyannis was 3.8% of the labor force. Hyannis is growing at the upper end and the lower end of the age cohorts, and although there has been an increase in persons 25 to 44 years of age, this has not necessarily been reflected in income change, as Hyannis witnessed an increase in the number of households earning $10,000 to $15,000 and an increase in the number of persons and families below the poverty level.

==Education==
Hyannis is home to Barnstable High School, the largest high school on Cape Cod. The school serves students in grades 8-12 and has an approximate enrollment of 2,400. Other high schools include Sturgis Charter Public School, a charter school featuring the International Baccalaureate program, and Pope John Paul II High School, the first and only college preparatory Catholic high school on Cape Cod. It is a part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River. Trinity Christian Academy, which recently opened a high school, is also located in Hyannis. Saint Francis Xavier Preparatory School is a prep middle school. Cape Cod Community College, in nearby West Barnstable, is a two-year community college, known locally as &quot;4-C&#x27;s&quot;.

==Transportation==

Hyannis is the main point of origin for ferry service to Nantucket. The Steamship Authority runs a year-round two and a half hour auto ferry service to Nantucket. The island can also be reached by a passenger-only, one-hour catamaran trip run by the Steamship Authority (seasonal) and Hy-Line Cruises (year-round).

=== Cronyism ===

&quot;Seminar&quot; magazine (2003) detailed Reliance founder Dhirubhai Ambani&#x27;s proximity to politicians, his enmity with Bombay Dyeing&#x27;s Nusli Wadia, the exposes by the Indian Express and Arun Shourie about illegal imports by the company and overseas share transactions by shell companies, and the botched attempt to acquire Larsen &amp; Toubro.

As early as 1996, &quot;Outlook&quot; magazine addressed other controversies related to fake and switched shares; insider trading; and a nexus with the state-owned Unit Trust of India.

Acting on a reference from CVC in March 2005, the CBI started probing the conspiracy that led to the filing of the charge sheet on 9 December 2011. The 2005 complaint had alleged irregularities in the issuance of insurance policies — for coverage of default payments — by NICL to RIL. The charge sheet also mentioned criminal offenses with dishonest intention and causing wrongful loss totaling ₹147.41 crores to NICL and wrongful gain to the private telecom provider.

===Krishna Godavari (KG) Basin gas controversy===
Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) was supposed to relinquish 25% of the total area outside the discoveries in 2004 and 2005, as per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). However, the entire block was declared as a discovery area and RIL was allowed to retain it. In 2011, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) criticized the Oil Ministry for this decision. The CAG also faulted RIL for limiting the competition in contracts, stating that RIL awarded a $1.1 billion contract to Aker on a single-bid basis.

===Petition against Reliance Jio===
A PIL filed in the Supreme Court by an NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation, through Prashant Bhushan, challenged the grant of a pan-India license to RJIL by the Government of India. The PIL alleged that RJIL was allowed to provide voice telephony along with its 4G data service, by paying an additional fee of just INR 16,580 million (US$280 million) which was arbitrary and unreasonable and contributed to a loss of INR 228,420 million (US$3.8 billion) to the exchequer.

The CAG in its draft report alleged rigging of the auction mechanism, whereby an unknown ISP, Infotech Broadband Services Pvt Ltd, acquired the spectrum by bidding 5000 times its net worth, after which the company was sold to Reliance Industries.

In February 2022, Reliance terminated the leases of hundreds of Future Retail locations, the next largest retail chain in India, and took possession of those brick-and-mortar shops. Future Retail had a deal to sell its assets to Reliance, but that deal was contested by Amazon.com, which in 2019 acquired a stake in a subunit of Future Retail along with certain rights with respect to the transfer of the retailer&#x27;s assets. Reliance&#x27;s possessions came after rounds of legal wrangling, including a 2020 arbitration in Singapore and an antitrust review by the Competition Commission of India.

===Stock manipulation and penalty===
For manipulating shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited (RPL), Reliance Industries was fined Rs. 950 crore (about 447 crore in retracted gains and 500 crore in interest) in 2007.

==Reliance demerger and family feud ==
The Ambani family holds around 45% of the shares in RIL. Since its inception, the company was managed by its founder and chairman Dhirubhai Ambani. After suffering a stroke in 1986, he handed over the daily operations of the company to his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani. After the death of Dhirubhai Ambani in 2002, the management of the company was taken up by both the brothers. In November 2004, Mukesh Ambani, in an interview, admitted to having differences with his brother Anil over &#x27;ownership issues&#x27;. He also said that the differences &quot;are in the private domain&quot;. The share prices of RIL were impacted by some margin when this news broke out. In 2005, after a bitter public feud between the brothers over the control of the Reliance empire, mother Kokilaben intervened to broker a deal splitting the RIL group business into two parts. In October 2005, the split of Reliance Group was formalised. Mukesh Ambani got Reliance Industries and IPCL. Younger brother Anil Ambani received telecom, power, entertainment, and financial services business of the group. The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group includes Reliance Communications, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Capital, Reliance Natural Resources and Reliance Power.

The division of Reliance group business between the two brothers also resulted in de-merger of 4 businesses from RIL. These businesses immediately became part of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. The existing shareholders in RIL, both the promoter group and non-promoters, received shares in the de-merged companies.

It has a small post office (ZIP code 02647) next door to a small seasonal convenience store, The News Shop and Gallery. It has one of the premier golf courses on Cape Cod, the Hyannisport Club, and is also home to the West Beach Club and the Hyannis Port Yacht Club. St. Andrew&#x27;s-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church and the Union Chapel conduct Sunday services in the summer. There also is a catwalk that goes to Halls Island with views of Nantucket Sound and a golf course.

<doc id="402988" wikidata="Q641553" url="?curid=402988" title="Thrust stage">
<text>In theatre, a thrust stage (a platform stage or open stage) is one that extends into the audience on three sides and is connected to the backstage area by its upstage end. A thrust has the benefit of greater intimacy between performers and the audience than a proscenium, while retaining the utility of a backstage area. This is in contrast to a theatre in the round, which is exposed on all sides to the audience, is without a backstage, and relies entirely on entrances in the auditorium or from under the stage. Entrances onto a thrust are most readily made from backstage, although some theatres provide for performers to enter through the audience using vomitory entrances. As with an arena, the audience in a thrust stage theatre may view the stage from three or more sides. Because the audience can view the performance from a variety of perspectives, it is usual for the blocking, props and scenery to receive thorough consideration to ensure that no perspective is blocked from view. A high-backed chair, for instance, when placed stage right, could create a blind spot in the stage left action.

==History==

The thrust stage is the earliest stage type in western theatre, first appearing in Greek theatres, and its arrangement was continued by the pageant wagon. As pageant wagons evolved into Elizabethan theatre, many of that era&#x27;s works, including those of Shakespeare, were performed on theatre with an open thrust stage, such as those of the Globe Theatre.

The thrust stage was generally out of use for centuries, and was resurrected by Orson Welles when he staged &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; for the Federal Theatre Project in 1937. There, the thrust apron extended over three rows of seats at Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre, extending 20 feet. &quot;It was constructed especially for the production and was probably one of the first to break out of the procenium arch in a Broadway playhouse&quot;, wrote critic Richard France.

Later resurrected by director Tyrone Guthrie and designer Tanya Moiseiwitsch, a thrust stage was used in 1953 by the Stratford Shakespeare Festival of Canada. Their Festival Theatre was originally under a tent, until a permanent thrust stage theatre facility was constructed in 1957. Since that time dozens of other thrust stage venues have been built using the concept.

<text>John Ball Zoo is located on the west side of the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States. The John Ball Zoo is situated on the ravines and bluffs along the west edge of the property.

The zoo houses more than 2,000 individual animals representing over 200 different species and is a significant regional attraction. With the Zoo School and Wildlife Conservation Fund, the zoo gives something back to the community and world as a whole.

The zoo is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and was the first zoo in Michigan to receive accreditation.

==History==
===Early history===

The original was donated to the city by noted pioneer and explorer John Ball upon his death in 1884. Shortly after, another was added and this marked the beginning of additional amenities, including ponds, a theater, a band shell, playgrounds, ball fields, trails, and the zoo. City commission records provide the first mention of animals on the property in 1891, when there was a debate about whether city money should be used to purchase more animals to add to the existing wounded and orphaned animals.

During the Great Depression, the zoo fell on hard times. Most of the collection was given away to other zoos. The buffalo and deer were butchered to help feed the poor. Only a few aging animals remained.

===Rebirth of the zoo===
During 1949, Katherine Whinery approached the mayor of Grand Rapids about resurrecting the zoo by forming a zoo society. A deal was made that if a zoo society could be formed, the city would hire a zoo director to run the zoo. Fred Meyer was hired as the first director of the zoo. Construction of the Monkey Island Exhibit, the first major exhibit ever built, was started in 1949 with an opening date of June 1, 1950. During the 50-60s, John Ball Zoo was built in the hills of the property.

===Recent history===

The John Ball Zoo was operated by the City of Grand Rapids until 1989, known as a regional asset because of the zoo, was sold to Kent County. 

During the 1990s, the zoo expanded with the building of Living Shores Aquarium, which is one of two aquariums in the state of Michigan, and a new cafe eating area outside of it. Also done at the same time was a new bald eagle aviary. The Mokomboso Valley Chimpanzee Exhibit opened in 2001.

From 2000 to 2003, controversy arose over idea of moving the zoo further into the flatlands of the property for an elephant exhibit. It pitted the zoo and zoo society against the neighbors. The neighbors tried to get the city of Grand Rapids to designate the whole zoo as a historical site as one way to stop the further development of the zoo. To stop the arguing, Fred Meijer offered to donate land and money if the zoo would move.

In 2004, a ballot was put forward to voters in Kent County to relocate the John Ball Zoological Gardens; the referendum was defeated, and the zoo will remain at its current location for the foreseeable future.

In 2005, a new $75-100 million master plan for the zoo was made involving all of the zoo and property. Besides the existing camels, African veld, chimps, petting zoo, and animal hospital exhibits, it reworks the whole zoo. The new plan for the zoo features a system of streams named &quot;Grand Rivers of the World&quot; that would connect the zoo to the property surrounding the zoo.

On April 27, 2007, the zoo broke ground on the first phase of the new master plan, starting construction of a $4.1 million &quot;BISSELL Lions of Lake Manyara&quot; exhibit. The zoo has not had a lion since &quot;Gilda&quot;, their last lion, died of old age in 2005. The exhibit was built for six lions, but only three were placed in the exhibit.

On June 21, 2008, the new green lion exhibit was open to the public.
Kent County including in the 2008-2009 Capital Improvement Allocation half the cost of renovation of the Monkey Island Exhibit. The other half of renovation is supposed to come from the zoo society. As expected the spider monkeys roamed the new island in May 2009. The waist high concrete wall that surround the exhibit will be removed. The cement floor and rocks of the exhibit and moat will be removed and replaced with grass and more natural looking rocks.

In 2014 the zoo formed a non profit to take ownership of the zoo independent of Kent county to help facilitate further growth for the institution. 

On July 8, 2016, the stingray lagoon exhibit was closed after all 18 cownose stingrays and three spotted bamboo sharks died due to a mechanical malfunction. A heavy rainstorm, which shorted a pump circuit, was blamed for the deaths. The backup system intended to alert zoo officials of a pump failure also failed.

====Inclined railway====
In August 2012, an inclined railway was opened at the zoo. A train of three cars linked together provides a four-minute ride to the upper areas of the park. The zoo calls it a funicular, but technically it is in the category of inclined elevator since there are not two vehicles (or trains in this case) that counterbalance each other. In either case the configuration as a three-car train rather than one car makes it an unusual example.

==Animal collection==

Most animals at John Ball Zoo were born in another zoo. Few of the animals are taken from the wild. Almost all the wild animals are at the zoo because they sustained injuries and can no longer live in their natural habitat.&lt;ref name=&quot;accesskent/zoo_animal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the zoo added a Komodo dragon named Precious.
During 2005, the zoo created an Australian walk-through exhibit that featured wallabies and budgies. The wallabies, if they want to, can come out in the walk way to be petted.

On May 9, 2007, the river otters had a baby boy. It first went out in the exhibit mid-July.

In early September, the female black-footed cat had two kittens.

The ring-tailed lemur exhibit was started in March 2009 and came out in May.

In 2010, the zoo brought in a troop of Guinea baboons, the largest alligator outside of Florida, moved their flamingos to another pond, and altered the old tiger exhibit to hold a rock hyrax and a group of colobus monkeys.

In 2021, John Ball Zoo announced that a new habitat at the entrance of the zoo was in the process of being built for pygmy hippos, the exhibit will also be home to a pair of white storks. The exhibit is planned to open in 2023. In 2022, John Ball Zoo hosted two male koalas from the San Diego Zoo Global Education and Conservation Project. After they arrived, their exhibit opened in May 11, 2022.

The zoo also offers a number of &#x27;Close Encounters&#x27; guests can book for an additional cost, including visiting with a red panda, feeding a hippo, or interacting with a sloth.

==Education and conservation==

=== Education ===
John Ball Zoo School is a sixth grade only magnet school for the Grand Rapids Public Schools. Each year, sixty students are selected for the school. The school teaches the normal Grand Rapids Public Schools curriculum but with a specialization using the zoo as a lab. The John Ball Zoo school has extra curricular studies and admission is based mostly on students&#x27; Michigan Educational Assessment Program scores. The students are required to complete large projects, including studying current events and environmental issues as part of the specialized curriculum. Learning is done mostly by hands-on experiences; for instance, students are able to go to the zoo frequently and have extended yet limited access to go inside certain animal enclosures.

===Wildlife Conservation Fund===
In 1985, a conservation fund was started by John Boyles. The fund pays special attention to native Michigan animals, but also has funded programs in support of endangered amphibians and reptiles. The Wildlife Conservation Fund has funded projects that helped conserve wildlife and habitats in 30 countries.

<doc id="402998" wikidata="Q5175869" url="?curid=402998" title="Cotuit, Massachusetts">
<text>Cotuit ( ) is one of the villages of the Town of Barnstable on Cape Cod in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, United States. Located on a peninsula on the south side of Barnstable about midway between Falmouth and Hyannis, Cotuit is bounded by the Santuit River to the west on the Mashpee town line, the villages of Marstons Mills to the north and Osterville to the east, and Nantucket Sound to the south. Cotuit is primarily residential with several small beaches including Ropes Beach, Riley&#x27;s Beach, The Loop Beach and Oregon Beach.

== History ==

===Colonial era ===
Cotuit was part of a major land purchase negotiated by Myles Standish of the Plymouth Colony with Paupmunnuck, Wampanoag headman of the Cotachessett village allegedly located on or near the island known today as Oyster Harbors, or Grand Island. That transaction, which occurred on May 17, 1648, was made by Paupmunnuck and his brother, and &quot;sold&quot; about &quot;twenty square miles of land in what is now the southwestern section of Barnstable.&quot;

The purchase price was two kettles, a bushel of Indian corn, and the agreement to fence off of land comprising the Cotachessett village. However this was renegotiated shortly after the conclusion of the Standish agreement to drop the fence and corn and settled instead on a price of &quot;one great brass kettle seven spans in wideness round about, and one broad hoe.&quot;

Cattle and the harvesting of salt marsh hay was the primary economic activity in colonial Cotuit. The Little River section of the village (near the present location of the Cotuit Oyster Company) was the site of some early shipyards.

The name &quot;Cotuit&quot; is derived from the Wampanoag term: &quot;place of the council&quot;. Cotuit was formerly known as Cotuit Port until the postmaster, Charles C. Bearse, dropped the &quot;port&quot; in 1872.

Built circa 1793, just off Main Street near the center of the village, is the Sampson&#x27;s Folly-Josiah Sampson House, the oldest standing home actually built in Cotuit (the Crocker House on Route 28 was built in 1749 in the village of West Barnstable and then moved to its present location in Cotuit by oxen). When this Federal-style New England house was built by English businessman Josiah Sampson, it was regarded as so extravagant for its day that it came to be known by the townspeople as &quot;Sampson&#x27;s Folly&quot;, faced with many windows and containing a ballroom for dancing on its second floor. Now listed as &quot;Sampson&#x27;s Folly&quot; on the National Register of Historic Places, this home once operated as a bed and breakfast but is now a private residence. The property contained a working farm and a mill on the Santuit River, lending its name to the road which ran nearby, Sampson&#x27;s Mill Road.

A list of Cotuit families with some genealogical information has been compiled by local historian James Gould.

=== Modern era ===

In the early 20th century, Cotuit saw more commercial activity, including hotels such as The Pines, one of Cape Cod&#x27;s earliest summer resorts. During World War II, Cotuit was home to Camp Candoit. During the 1970s there was a large restaurant called The Harbor View, located at 968 Main Street, which has been turned into a private residence. The Cotuit Inn was demolished in 1986, and condominiums were built in its place. In 1987 the Cotuit Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

== Geography ==
The latitude of Cotuit is 41.61667. The longitude is -70.4375. According to the 1995 Town of Barnstable Comprehensive Plans, Cotuit is among the smallest of the town&#x27;s seven villages, having a total area of roughly . The major part of the village is bounded on three sides by water. Although Cotuit has of coastline, comparable in length to its of scenic roadways, the 8 town-owned beaches, landings and ways to the water in the village combine to occupy only .

=== Central Village ===

The commercial zone is small, with only a few businesses located in the center of the village: a small restaurant and bar called The Kettle-Ho (named after the legend of how the town was acquired from the native Wampanoags for a kettle and a hoe, see above), a post office (02635), a Federated church (United Church of Christ/United Methodist Church), a non-profit nursery school, several real estate offices, an insurance office, an architect&#x27;s office and the Cotuit Public Library. To the north on Main Street is a small variety store and a grocery store. Other Cotuit businesses are located along Route 28 in the Santuit-Newtown area of the town, also the location of the Cotuit Center for the Arts and the Cahoon Museum of American Art.

The Cahoon Museum of American Art is located at the former home of Martha and Ralph Cahoon, who were prominent American painters.

A few steps from the village green is the historic Freedom Hall, currently used for various civic gatherings and elections, and Mariners&#x27; Hall, currently a Masonic Lodge. A little further down Main Street is the Museum of the Historical Society of Cotuit and Santuit, which includes the Samuel B. Dottridge Homestead, a representation of coastal life in Cotuit in the first half of the 19th century.

=== Santuit ===
The northwestern corner of Cotuit is referred to as Santuit and represents a distinct sub-village within Cotuit, marking the intersection of Main Street, Route 28 and Route 130. It is the westernmost village in the town of Barnstable and is the location of several historically significant buildings, including the Crocker House (formerly site of the Regatta Restaurant which closed in 2012), the Cahoon Museum of Art, and other colonial-era houses. The former Santuit Post Office still stands on Main Street but is now part of a private residence, though it retains the post office boxes used by Santuit residents. The former home of the EPAC Grotto of Masons is now the site of St. Michael the Archangel Antiochian Orthodox church.

=== Cotuit Bay ===

Cotuit Bay, the main body of water in town, is bounded by Cotuit to the west, Grand Island/Oyster Harbors to the east (part of the village of Osterville) and Dead Neck/Sampson&#x27;s Island to the south, making the bay a quiet harbor and part of the so-called Three Bays system which includes North and West Bays. Sampson&#x27;s Island is an Audubon bird sanctuary, jointly managed by the Three Bays Preservation organization, that can only be reached by boat. A permit is required for visitors. The bay is shallow and busy with boat traffic during the summer months. It is the site of the Cotuit Oyster Company.

There are no commercial marine facilities in Cotuit Bay. The nearest source of fuel (diesel and gasoline) is in Osterville to the east. A number of local boatyards, including the renowned Pecks&#x27; Boatyard founded by Captain Leonard Peck, service boats in the harbor, but there is no commercial marina in the bay or inner harbor. A private launch service runs from the town dock from May through October, charging a small fee for trips to the mooring field (hail on VHF Channel 68). A free pump-out service for marine heads (toilets) is provided by the town harbormaster (available by hailing on radio or phoning 508-790-6273, facility also located at Crosby Yacht Yard in Osterville). Ice and groceries for visiting boaters is available ashore at the Cotuit Grocery Store on Main Street.

A concrete boat ramp for small boats is located at Old Shore Road near Ropes Beach. Car and trailer parking is permitted only with a Town of Barnstable beach parking sticker, available to residents from the town&#x27;s recreation department.

There are several public ways to water, including Cordwood Landing off Old Post Road, Ropes Beach, Town Dock, Riley&#x27;s Beach, Loop Beach, and Oregon Way to Water. Other public paths exist and are catalogued by the Barnstable Association of Recreational Shellfishermen.

Mooring is regulated by the Town of Barnstable.

== Government ==
Cotuit is one of seven villages in the Town of Barnstable in Barnstable County. It is represented on the Barnstable Town Council by a Precinct 7 Town Councilor elected every four years. The Cotuit Fire District was incorporated by an act of the Massachusetts General Court in 1926 which grants the district the authority to establish public safety services, including a fire department and rescue personnel; a water department to provide the village with drinking water; and a Prudential Committee to oversee the budgets and infrastructure of the district. There are ten elected officials: a Moderator; three members of the Prudential Committee; three members of the Board of Water Commissioners; and three members of the Board of Fire Commissioners. Each elected official serves a three-year term. An annual district meeting is convened on the last Wednesday of May, preceded by the annual elections where one member of the Prudential, Fire and Water boards is elected by ballot.

== Demographics ==
According to the 1995 Town of Barnstable Comprehensive plans, Cotuit, one of the less densely populated of the villages, has a year-round population of roughly 2,600, with an additional 1,600 summer residents.

== Cotuit Oysters ==

=== Cotuit Oysters ===
Cotuit Oysters are a distinct version of the eastern oyster species, unique to Cotuit Bay and remarkable for their flavor. Wild oysters are making a gradual comeback along some shores. &quot;Seed now comes from a hatchery...but unspoiled Cotuit Bay has changed little, and the oysters still have the bright and briny flavor they are famous for.&quot;

=== Cotuit Oyster Company ===
The Cotuit Oyster Company dates back to 1837 and is still cultivating the distinctive Cotuit Oysters with their unique flavor, producing the oldest brand name of oyster in the United States. Cotuit is world-famous for its oysters, and in years past they rivaled Wellfleet oysters and could be found on menus in restaurants from San Francisco to Paris. In the 1980s, however, many of the Cotuit oyster beds were significantly diminished. Today, Cotuit Oysters are re-appearing on the menus of many fine-dining establishments on Cape Cod and in Boston, and the world-famous Oyster Bar Restaurant in Grand Central Terminal in New York City.

== Recreation ==

=== Cotuit Skiffs ===
Cotuit Skiffs, formerly known as Cotuit Mosquitos, are gaff-rigged &quot;one-design&quot; sailboats that have been sailed on the waters of Cotuit Bay for the last 104 years, making them one of the oldest continuously sailed fleets of one-design racing boats in the world.

They were designed by Stanley Butler after the turn of the 20th century and were modeled after the flat-bottomed skiffs used in the oyster and commercial clam trade. Those boats were built with hard chines and low gunwales to provide a stable platform from which to clam from. The design was altered many times until 1926 when the design was standardized.

Cotuit Skiffs are rigged like classic Cape Cod catboats—that is they carry only a gaff-rigged mainsail, no jib, and their masts are stepped in the very bow of the boat. They carry a considerable amount of sail and are considered an extremely challenging boat to sail, especially in a brisk breeze. They are fitted with a centerboard and are generally raced by one or two people, with three carried only in high winds. The huge mainsail and its boom overhang the hull&#x27;s transom by four feet.

Since 1906 the Cotuit Mosquito Yacht Club (CMYC) has hosted races during the summer months. Although the yacht club has had more than one fleet—juniors compete in inter-club regatta in 420s - the gaff-rigged skiff has been raced for slightly over the 100 years that the yacht club has existed. The CMYC is supported by the Association of the Cotuit Mosquito Yacht Club, a non-profit organization that manages a sailing instructional program for children between 8 and 18 years of age.

CMYC historian Larry Odence published a comprehensive history of the Cotuit Skiff in 2009: &quot;Mosquito Boats: The First Hundred Years of the Cotuit Skiff&quot;, which was published in a limited edition, but available for loan from the Cotuit Library.

=== Cotuit Kettleers and the Cape Cod Baseball League ===

The Cotuit Kettleers is an amateur collegiate summer baseball team in the Cape Cod Baseball League. The team plays its home games at Lowell Park, and has been supported by the Cotuit Athletic Association since 1947. Currently managed by Mike Roberts, the Kettleers have won more Cape League titles than any team in league history, and have featured dozens of players who went on to careers in Major League Baseball, such as Will Clark, Joe Girardi, and Chase Utley.

<doc id="402999" wikidata="Q4971219" url="?curid=402999" title="Charolais cattle">
<text>The Charolais () or Charolaise () is a French breed of taurine beef cattle. It originates in, and is named for, the Charolais area surrounding Charolles, in the Saône-et-Loire department, in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region of eastern France.

Charolais are raised for meat; they may be crossed with other breeds, including Angus and Hereford cattle.

== History ==

The Charolais is the second-most numerous cattle breed in France after the Holstein Friesian and is the most common beef breed in that country, ahead of the Limousin. At the end of 2014, France had 4.22 million head of Charolais, including 1.56 million cows, down 0.6% from a year earlier.

The Charolais is a world breed: it is reported to DAD-IS by 68 countries, of which 37 report population data. The world population is estimated at 730,000. The largest populations are reported from the Czech Republic and Mexico.

The breed was introduced to the southern United States from Mexico in 1934.

As the cradle of the Charolais cattle, the Charolais-Brionnais Country is applicant for the UNESCO&#x27;s label as a World Heritage Site to preserve, consolidate and transmit this resource.

==Characteristics==

It is among the heaviest of cattle breeds: bulls weigh from , and cows from . The coat ranges from white to cream-colored; the nose is uniformly pink.

The Charbray, a cross-breed with Brahman cattle, is recognized as a breed in some countries. The Brazilian Chicana is a composite breed with 5/8 Charolais and 3/8 Indu-Brasil. Other derived breeds include Charford and Char-Swiss in the United States.

<text>Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) is an Indian fast-moving consumer goods company, headquartered in Mumbai. It is a subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever. Its products include foods, beverages, cleaning agents, personal care products and other consumer staples.

HUL was established in 1931 as Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Co. Following a merger of constituent groups in 1956, it was renamed Hindustan Lever Limited. The company was renamed again in June 2007 as Hindustan Unilever Limited.

Hindustan Unilever has been at the helm of a lot of controversies, such as dumping highly toxic mercury-contaminated waste in regular dumps, contaminating the land and water of Kodaikanal. (See: Kodaikanal mercury poisoning). The British-Dutch company also faced major flak for an advertising campaign attacking the Hindu pilgrimage site at Kumbh Mela, calling it a &quot;place where old people get abandoned,&quot; a move that was termed racist and insensitive.

As of 2019 Hindustan Unilever&#x27;s portfolio had more than 50 product brands in 14 categories. The company has 21,000 employees and recorded sales of ₹346.19 billion in FY2017–18.

In December 2018 HUL announced its acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline India&#x27;s consumer business for US$3.8 billion in an all-equity merger deal with a 1:4.39 ratio. However, the integration of GSK&#x27;s 3,800 employees remained uncertain as HUL stated there was no clause for retention of employees in the deal. In April 2020, HUL completed its merger with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (GSKCH India) after completing all legal procedures. In December 2022, HUL&#x27;s market cap was Rs. 6385484.2 million.

==Presence==

Hindustan Unilever&#x27;s corporate headquarters are located in Andheri, Mumbai. The campus is spread over 12.5 acres of land and houses over 1,600 employees. The Campus is designed by Mumbai-based architecture firm Kapadia Associates.

The company&#x27;s previous headquarters were located in Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai at the Lever House, where it was housed for more than 46 years.

The Hindustan Unilever Research Centre (HURC) was set up in 1966 in Mumbai, and Unilever Research India in Bangalore in 1997. In 2006, the company&#x27;s research facilities were brought together at a single site in Bangalore.

== Controversies ==
=== Mercury pollution ===
In 2001 a thermometer factory in Kodaikanal run by Hindustan Unilever dumped glass contaminated with mercury in C. Raj Kumar, and selling it on to scrap merchants unable to deal with it appropriately. Protests by local NGOs and Greenpeace lead to the shutting of the factory in March 2001. After protest by activists led by Deepak Malghan of the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore Hindustan Unilever admitted before court to being guilty in the case in 2010.

=== Skin lightening creams ===
Hindustan Unilever&#x27;s &quot;Glow &amp; Lovely&quot; is the leading skin-lightening cream for women in India. The company had to cease television advertisements for the product in 2007. Advertisements depicted depressed, dark-complexioned women, who had been ignored by employers and men, suddenly finding new boyfriends and glamorous careers after the cream had lightened their skin. In 2008, Hindustan Unilever made former Miss World Priyanka Chopra a brand ambassador for Pond&#x27;s, and she then appeared in a mini-series of television commercials for another skin lightening product, &#x27;White Beauty&#x27;, alongside Saif Ali Khan and Neha Dhupia; these advertisements, showing Priyanka&#x27;s face with a clearly darker complexion against the visibly fairer Neha Dhupia, were widely criticised for perpetuating racism and lowering the self-esteem of women and girls throughout India who were misled by HUL to believe that they needed to be white to be beautiful. The company rebranded the cream from &quot;Fair and Lovely&quot; to &quot;Glow and Lovely&quot;, removing the word &quot;Fair&quot; from the brand.

=== Triclosan ===
Several academic papers have pointed out the firm&#x27;s continued use of the antibacterial agent Triclosan (&#x27;Active B&#x27;) in India because it is under review by the American Food and Drug Administration (US FDA).

=== Kumbh Mela ad ===
In March 2019 HUL&#x27;s advertisement for its beverage Brooke Bond Red Label tea was criticised on social media. A company tweet referred to the Kumbh Mela as a place where elderly people get abandoned by their family members. This resulted in a severe backlash in the form of an adverse hashtag trending on Twitter &#x27;#BoycottHindustanUnilever&#x27;.

== Awards ==

The Institute of Competitiveness, India, recognized Hindustan Unilever Limited&#x27;s Project Shakti for ‘Creating Shared Value’ and gave the company the Porter Prize for 2014. It ranked number one on the Forbes list of ‘Most Innovative Companies’ globally for 2014. It also received an award as a &#x27;Conscious Capitalist of the Year&#x27; at the 2013 Forbes India Leadership Awards. Unilever was named the fourth most respected company in India in a survey conducted by Business World in 2013.

In a 2015 Nielsen campus track-business school survey, Hindustan Unilever was among the top employers of choice for B-school students graduating that year. It has often been called a &#x27;Dream Employer&#x27; for application by B-School students in India. In 2012, it was recognised as one of the world&#x27;s most innovative companies by Forbes. With a ranking of number 6, it was the highest ranked FMCG company.

HUL is one of the country&#x27;s largest exporters; it has been recognised as a Golden Super Star Trading House by the Government of India.

== Brands and products ==
HUL is the market leader in Indian consumer products with presence in over 20 consumer categories such as soaps, tea, detergents and shampoos among others with over 700 million Indian consumers using its products.

<doc id="403004" wikidata="Q7107667" url="?curid=403004" title="Osterville, Massachusetts">
<text>Osterville is one of seven villages within the town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, United States. The village of Osterville is located on the south side of Barnstable on Nantucket Sound. Osterville is a residential community that includes marshes, bays, ponds, a small lake, beaches, and a small business district. Notably, the village is home to the Crosby Yacht Yard; the Crosbys are America&#x27;s oldest active wooden boat-building family.

==History==
Osterville was originally named Cotacheset, based on the Native American name for the area. Over time it became a center for &quot;oystering&quot; (harvesting wild oysters) and was renamed Oysterville. Later a map misspelled the name as Osterville and the village became so.

The following is from the memoirs of Sarah Hallet Boult, Osterville, MA, age 93, as of March 1, 1955:

Membership in the Osterville Historical Society is not limited but village-wide and open to all who are making history today, steadily swarming over the pleasant acres that “Paupinanack sold for a copper kettle and some fencing done.” How many years ago? About 1648.
The range of “Cotacheset” was along East Bay and the Centerville River, and when a man said he was going down to Kocochoice, he meant where Crosby’s boat shop is now, along West Bay.
The part of the David Estate that adjoins Marstons Mills was known as Mystic. The Shawme Indians being neighbors to Roger Goodspeed who was the first to venture into this territory. The Historical Society all began when a small group of three people recalling old tales of older generations. Promptly the group increased and interest as well, in back tracking to the very first, few that planted another firm foothold on Cape Cod sand.

==About==
Osterville&#x27;s business district includes a public library, gift stores, women&#x27;s fashions, restaurants, a small market, banks with ATMs, a pizza place, package store (spirits), a U.S. Post Office, a hardware store, art galleries, barber and beauty shops, and real estate brokers.

During July and August, Osterville&#x27;s population swells due to seasonal residents. Many summer residents maintain a second house in Osterville while residing most of the year in the Greater Boston area. The village is known for its oceanfront estates.

The cemetery for the village of Osterville is the Hillside Cemetery on Old Mill Road.

The Osterville Historical Museum, established in 1931, preserves the history of Osterville for all of those who love her, past, present, and future. The museum includes the largest collection of wooden boats in Massachusetts. The Cammett House, the oldest house in Osterville, and the Captain Jonathan Parker House, owned by a 1820s coastal schooner captain, are also located on the museum campus. A series of boat shops includes the 1850 original Herbert F. Crosby boat shop. Every Friday mid-June to mid-September, the museum hosts the Osterville Farmers&#x27; Market.

Armstrong-Kelley Park, the oldest and largest privately owned park on Cape Cod, is located in Osterville. Crosby Yacht Yard is port to the Crosby catboat, and the Wianno senior, the latter a favorite of President John F. Kennedy, a resident of nearby Hyannis Port.

A steel drawbridge connects the village to Little Island and Grand Island (also known as Oyster Harbors), a gated community featuring many luxury houses and a private country club. The neighborhood of Wianno abuts the East Bay section of Osterville.

There are two private country clubs in Osterville: the Wianno Club and the Oyster Harbors Club. Each club has a private 18-hole golf course, private tennis facilities, and a private beach. The Wianno Yacht Club, a private club on West Bay, offers children&#x27;s sailing lessons.

Dowses Beach in Osterville is a Barnstable town beach; there are toilet facilities with showers and a beach house for changing in privacy. Lifeguards are present during the summer months only.

==Education==
Osterville is home to a private K-12 school, Cape Cod Academy.

<text>A wagon (or waggon in British English) is a heavy four-wheeled vehicle pulled by draft animals or on occasion by humans, used for transporting goods, commodities, agricultural materials, supplies and sometimes people.

Wagons are immediately distinguished from carts (which have two wheels) and from lighter four-wheeled vehicles primarily for carrying people, such as carriages. Animals such as horses, mules, or oxen usually pull wagons. One animal or several, often in pairs or teams may pull wagons. However, there are examples of human-propelled wagons, such as mining corfs.

A wagon was formerly called a wain and one who builds or repairs wagons is a wainwright. More specifically, a wain is a type of horse- or oxen-drawn, load-carrying vehicle, used for agricultural purposes rather than transporting people. A wagon or cart, usually four-wheeled; for example, a haywain, normally has four wheels, but the term has now acquired slightly poetical connotations, so is not always used with technical correctness. However, a two-wheeled &quot;haywain&quot; would be a hay cart, as opposed to a carriage. &quot;Wain&quot; is also an archaic term for a chariot. &quot;Wain&quot; can also be a verb, to carry or deliver, and has other meanings.

Contemporary or modern animal-drawn wagons may be of metal instead of wood and have regular wheels with rubber tires instead of traditional wagon wheels.

A person who drives wagons is called a &quot;wagoner&quot;, a &quot;teamster&quot;, a &quot;bullocky&quot; (Australia), a &quot;muleteer&quot;, or simply a &quot;driver&quot;.

Wagons have served numerous purposes, with numerous corresponding designs. As with motorized vehicles, some are designed to serve as many functions as possible, while others are highly specialized.

==Terminology and design==

The exact name and terminology used are often dependent on the design or shape of the wagon. If low and sideless it may be called a dray, trolley or float. When traveling over long distances and periods, wagons may be covered with cloth to protect their contents from the elements; these are &quot;covered wagons&quot;. If it has high sides, with or without a permanent top, it may be called a &quot;van&quot;. A wagon might be unsprung if ordinarily used over rough ground or cobbles.

A front axle assembly, in its simplest form, is an assembly of a short beam with a pivot plate, two wagon wheels and spindles as well as a drawbar attached to this. A pin attaches the device to a chariot, a wagon or a coach, making the turning radius smaller.

== Types ==

=== Farm wagon ===

Farm wagons are built for general multi-purpose usage in an agricultural or rural setting. These include gathering hay, crops and wood, and delivering them to the farmstead or market. Wagons can also be pulled with tractors for easy transportation of those materials.

A common form found throughout Europe is the , a large wagon the sides of which often consisted of ladders strapped in place to hold in hay or grain, though these could be removed to serve other needs. A common type of farm wagon particular to North America is the buckboard.

=== Freight wagon ===

Freight wagons were used for the overland hauling of freight and bulk commodities. They were not designed for transporting people and were not built for comfort. Many were constructed without a driver&#x27;s seat or bench, leaving the driver to walk alongside the wagon or ride atop of one of the horses. Many freight wagons had a &quot;lazyboard,&quot; a plank that could be pulled out for sitting upon then pushed back when not needed. In America, lazyboards were located on the left side and close to the brake because wagons were steered from the left side.

In the United States and Canada, the large, heavily built Conestoga wagon was a predominant form of freight wagon in the late 18th and 19th centuries, often used for hauling goods on the Great Wagon Road in the Appalachian Valley and across the Appalachian Mountains.

Even larger wagons were built, such as the twenty-mule team wagons, used for hauling borax from Death Valley, which could haul per pair. The wagons&#x27; bodies were long and deep; the rear wheels were in diameter, and the wagons weighed empty.

Freight wagons in the American West were hauled by oxen, mules or horses. Freight wagon teams would generally haul between three and thirty-five tons of freight when hauling to mining outposts. On the return, they would haul ore to steamboats or to railroad depots.

=== Delivery wagon ===

A delivery wagon was used to deliver merchandise such as milk, bread, produce, meat and ice to residential and commercial customers, predominantly in urban settings. The concept of express wagons and of paneled delivery vans developed in the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, delivery wagons were often finely painted, lettered and varnished, serving as image-builders and rolling advertisements. Special forms of delivery wagon include an ice wagon and a milk wagon.

Tank wagons carried liquid cargoes. Water wagons delivered to areas without piped water and for military camp use. In the early 1900s, the American street flusher used a gas-powered pump to clean city streets of litter or mud, and to wet down dust in dry seasons. Liquid manure wagons were low tank vehicles for spreading manure on fields in the 1860s-1900s. Oil wagons operated from the 1880s to 1920s and held up to 500 gallons of oil or spirits.

In the city center of Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany, since 1992 the city&#x27;s plants are irrigated using a horse-drawn wagon with a water tank.

=== Living accommodations ===

Wagons have also served as the first mobile homes, as mobile workshops, and mobile kitchens.

* Shepherd&#x27;s hut - for remote shepherds
* Vardo - traditional wagon of the 19th-century British Romani people
* Living van - used to house roving work crews during early steam engine days
* Showman&#x27;s wagon - elaborate living accommodations for showmen
* Chuckwagon - a small wagon used for providing food and cooking; essentially a portable kitchen

=== Entertainment and show ===

Travelling circuses decorated their wagons to be able to take part in the grand parade—even packing wagons for equipment, animal cage wagons, living vans and band wagons. Popular in North America was, and still is, the float or show wagon, driven by six horses pulling a highly decorated show wagon with a token payload, and heavily painted with company or owner advertising. Horse-drawn wagons are popular attractions at tourist destinations for leisurely sightseeing.

=== Motorized wagons ===

During the transition to mechanized vehicles from animal-powered, vehicles were built by coachbuilders and the bodies and undercarriages were substantially similar to the horse-drawn vehicles.

* Hippomobile - 1860s invention, gas powered
* Steam wagon - late 1800s, large steam-powered vehicle
* Duryea Motor Wagon - 1890s gasoline powered, patterned from the American buggy
* Auto Wagon - early 1900s gas-powered, patterned from the American buggy
* High wheeler - 1910s - often made from converted horse-drawn wagons

In modern times, the term station wagon survives as a type of automobile. It describes a car with a passenger compartment that extends to the back of the vehicle, that has no trunk, that has one or more rear seats that can be folded making space for carrying cargo, as well as featuring an opening tailgate or liftgate.


=== Modern agricultural wagons ===

== Wagon train ==

In migration and military settings, wagons were often found in large groups called wagon trains.

In warfare, large groups of supply wagons were used to support traveling armies with food and munitions, forming &quot;baggage trains&quot;. During the American Civil War, these wagon trains would often be accompanied by the wagons of private merchants, known as sutlers, who sold goods to soldiers, as well as the wagons of photographers and news reporters. Special purpose-built support wagons existed for blacksmithing, telegraphy and even observation ballooning.

In migration settings, such as the emigrant trails of the American West and the Great Trek of South Africa, wagons would travel together for support, navigation and protection. A group of wagons may be used to create an improvised fort called a laager, made by circling them to form an enclosure. In these settings, a chuckwagon is a small wagon used for providing food and cooking, essentially a portable kitchen.
== Draft animals ==
In addition to horses and oxen, animals such as mules and goats have been used as draft animals for appropriately-sized wagons.

== Wagons in art ==
As a common, important element in history and life, wagons have been the subjects of artwork. Some examples are the paintings &quot;The Hay Wain&quot; and &quot;The Haywain Triptych&quot;, and on the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar.

<text>West Barnstable is a seaside village in the northwestern part of the town of Barnstable, Barnstable County, Massachusetts, United States. Once devoted to agricultural pursuits, West Barnstable now is largely residential and historic. Originally founded in 1639 as part of its neighboring village Barnstable, West Barnstable separated in 1717 with the split into two parishes of the local congregational church.

==Natural features==
These include six-mile long Sandy Neck Barrier Beach which protects the extensive Great Marshes, the latter a source of salt hay that attracted the first English settlers to the area in the mid-17th century.

==Notable people==
Remarkably, in the 18th century, the village produced four nationally prominent leaders at a time when there were no more than 500 inhabitants. James Otis the Patriot was the original intellectual leader of the revolutionary movement in Boston in the years leading up to the War of Independence.

His sister, Mercy Otis Warren, also born next to the Great Marshes, became a political activist, one of the first women writers in the country, and a historian of note. She is a member of the Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Lemuel Shaw, another native of the village, held the important post of chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from 1830 to 1860 and earned the reputation of a leading jurist in the nation&#x27;s formative constitutional history.

The fourth native, Captain John &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Percival, rose to the highest rank in the U.S. Navy, serving in four wars. In late 1844 he saved and restored the U.S. frigate &quot;Constitution&quot; and then sailed her around the world, the venerable ship&#x27;s only circumnavigation.

==Description==
The fully restored 1717 Congregational meetinghouse, West Parish of Barnstable, UCC, (West Parish Memorial Foundation) remains a central feature of the village. Also in the center of town, The Old Village Store is a historic and prominent place for locals. Sandy Neck Beach, the largest beach on the mid-cape, is located in the village. Most of West Barnstable consists of Sandy Neck, the Great Marsh/Barnstable Harbor, and the popular West Barnstable Conservation Area. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of Finnish immigrants settled here, and, to this day, the eastern side of the village is known as &quot;Finn Town&quot;, while the area near the West Barnstable Train Station is known as &quot;Shark City&quot; reputedly because of the card sharks who hung out there.

==Education==
West Barnstable is home to Cape Cod Community College, the only college on the Cape proper, as well as the Cape Cod Conservatory of Music, Art, Drama &amp; Dance.

==Transportation==
The town was one that had been served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Cape Codder&quot; train service (1986-1996); however, it has been eliminated from the schedule of the seasonal &quot;Cape Flyer&quot; train service. From the 19th Century, under the Old Colony Railroad and until 1964 under the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, passenger trains served Sandwich. Trains of the 1940s-1960s included the &quot;Day Cape Codder&quot; and the &quot;Neptune.&quot;

<doc id="403012" wikidata="Q162500" url="?curid=403012" title="Clare W. Graves">
<text>Clare W. Graves (December 21, 1914 – January 3, 1986) was a professor of psychology and originator of the &quot;emergent cyclical theory&quot; of adult human development, aspects of which were later popularised as &quot;Spiral Dynamics&quot;. He was born in New Richmond, Indiana.

==Education and academic career==
Graves graduated from Union College in New York in 1940 and received his master&#x27;s degree and PhD in psychology in 1943 and 1945, respectively, from Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. He taught at Western Reserve for three years before returning to Union College as an Associate Professor in 1948. He was promoted to full Professor in 1956, and retired in 1978.

In 1975, Don Edward Beck, a professor at North Texas University, sought Graves out on the basis of his 1974 article in &quot;The Futurist.&quot; By this point, Graves&#x27;s health was declining, and Beck resolved to record Graves&#x27;s knowledge. They were later joined by Christopher Cowan, with whom Beck developed Spiral Dynamics as an extension of Graves&#x27;s work. After Graves&#x27;s death, Cowan, his consulting partner Natasha Todorovic, and archivist William R. Lee, became custodians of Graves&#x27;s work, maintaining the official Clare W. Graves website, which provides access to some of those materials.

==Emergent cyclical theory==

In the early mid-twentieth century, Graves decided to conduct experiments that he hoped would reconcile the various approaches to human nature and questions about psychological maturity, as he saw elements of truth and error in all theories known at the time. Rather than construct a hypothesis about how the conflicting systems could be resolved, Graves posed several open-ended questions and looked to see what patterns would emerge from his data. While not typical at the time, these approaches would later become known as grounded theory and inductive thematic analysis.

Based on data collected over the next several decades, Graves observed that the emergence within humans of new bio-psycho-social systems in response to the interplay of external conditions with neurology follows a hierarchy in several dimensions, though without guarantees as to time lines or even direction: both progression and regression are possibilities in his model. Furthermore, each level in the hierarchy alternates as the human is either trying to make the environment adapt to the self, or the human is adapting the self to the existential conditions. He called these &#x27;express self&#x27; and &#x27;deny self&#x27; systems, and the swing between them is the cyclic aspect of his theory. Graves saw this process of stable plateaus interspersed with change intervals as never ending, up to the limits of the brain of &quot;Homo sapiens,&quot; something he viewed as far greater than we have yet imagined.

==Influence==

Through his emergent cyclical theory, Graves has primarily been influential in the area of management theory, both during his lifetime and continuing into more recent years.

 This was both the first major area in which he published, and a major focus in his posthumous book detailing the complete theory.

While sometimes cited in the context of developmental psychology, Graves is not broadly influential within developmental psychology academia. Graves has been criticized for not fully publishing his theory and data, with one source observing that by &quot;leaving his legacy in not-quite-finished form, and in cultivating followers who have elaborated his ideas leaving them essentially unquestioned, [Graves] appears to have succeeded in leaving us a provocative and important theory, while so far avoiding anything like a debate about its merits.&quot;

Graves&#x27;s ideas gained a broader audience through non-academic publications, most notably a 1974 article in &quot;The Futurist&quot; which attracted the attention of those who later created Spiral Dynamics. Graves influenced Ken Wilber&#x27;s integral philosophy both directly and through Spiral Dynamics. Through Spiral Dynamics, he has also influenced metamodernism.

==Works==
Graves worked towards a book describing his theories, but published few articles and gave few public talks on his work during his lifetime. A full chronological bibliography is available online; a selection of his most notable publications is provided below.

Graves was reportedly distressed by the poor reception given to Abraham Maslow at an American Psychological Association seminar in the mid 1950s and determined not to publish his full theory until he was confident he could defend it. Due to a brain injury sustained in 1975, Graves abandoned his book manuscript in 1977. The manuscript, consisting of largely complete drafts of sections describing the derivation of the theory from experimental data, and comparing it to other theories, was edited together with other primary sources to reconstruct the missing section on the nature of the levels, and published posthumously in 2005 as &quot;The Never Ending Quest&quot;.

Additionally, an edited transcription of a seminar given by Graves at the Washington School of Psychiatry in 1971, along with a reprint of his 1970 article in the Fall 1970 issue of the &quot;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&quot;, were collected and published in book form in 2004 as &quot;Levels of Human Existence&quot;.

<text>Centerville is one of the seven villages in the Town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, United States, on Cape Cod. Located on the South Side of Barnstable, Centerville is primarily residential, and includes a small business district as well as several notable beaches. It has its own elementary school and public library, and is home to the Centerville Historic District and the Centerville Historical Museum.

Centerville contains the neighborhood of Craigville, which includes Craigville Beach. Centerville was originally named Chequaquet (meaning &quot;pleasant harbor&quot;). Centerville is the location of the award-winning, independent Four Seas Ice Cream shop on South Main Street near the intersection with Old Stage Road. It is also home to the Centerville Pie Company, mentioned on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;s 2010 &quot;Oprah&#x27;s Favorite Things&quot; episode. Located on Pine Street is the St. Francis Xavier cemetery, which is the final resting place for Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her husband Sargent Shriver. In late June 1993, Jaleel White, who portrayed Steve Urkel on the sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot;, performed in a one-man production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; in front of the Centerville Public Library.

<doc id="403016" wikidata="Q2259408" url="?curid=403016" title="Pinky (film)">
<text>Pinky is a 1949 American drama film directed by Elia Kazan and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck. The screenplay was adapted by Philip Dunne and Dudley Nichols based on Cid Ricketts Sumner&#x27;s 1946 novel &quot;Quality&quot;. It stars Jeanne Crain as the title character, a young light-skinned black woman who passes for white. It also stars Ethel Barrymore, Ethel Waters and William Lundigan.

&quot;Pinky&quot; was released in the United States on September 29, 1949 by 20th Century-Fox. It generated considerable controversy because of its subject of race relations and the casting of Crain to play a black woman. It was nonetheless a critical and commercial success, and earned Crain, Barrymore and Waters Academy Award nominations.

==Plot==

Pinky Johnson returns to the South to visit Dicey, the illiterate black laundress grandmother who raised her. Pinky confesses to Dicey that she passed for white while studying to be a nurse in the North. She had also fallen in love with a white man, Dr. Thomas Adams, who knows nothing about her black heritage.

Pinky is harassed by racist local law enforcement while attempting to reclaim money owed to her grandmother. Two white men try to sexually assault her. Dr. Canady, a black physician, asks Pinky to train black nursing students, but Pinky plans to return to the North.

Dicey asks Pinky to stay temporarily to care for her ailing, elderly white friend and neighbor Miss Em. Pinky has always disliked Miss Em and considers her another of the many bigots in the area. Pinky relents and agrees to tend Miss Em after learning that when Dicey had pneumonia, Miss Em cared for her. Pinky nurses the strong-willed Miss Em, but does not hide her resentment. However, as they spend time together, she grows to like and respect her patient.

Miss Em bequeaths Pinky her stately house and property when she dies, but greedy relative Melba Wooley challenges the will. Everyone advises Pinky that she has no chance of winning, but she begs Miss Em&#x27;s old friend, retired judge Walker, to defend her in court. With great reluctance, he agrees to take the case. Pinky washes clothes by hand when her grandmother is sick in order to pay court expenses. At the trial, despite hostile white spectators and the absence of Dr. Adams, the only defense witness, presiding judge Shoreham unexpectedly rules in Pinky&#x27;s favor. When Pinky thanks her attorney, he coldly informs her that justice was served, but not the interests of the community.

Tom, who has arrived from the North after tracking Pinky down, wants her to sell the inherited property, resume her masquerade as a white woman, marry him and leave the South, but she refuses, firmly believing that Miss Em intended her to use the house and property for some purpose, and Tom leaves. Pinky establishes a clinic and nursery school staffed by Dr. Canady&#x27;s black nursing students on the property.

==Cast==

* Jeanne Crain as Patricia &quot;Pinky&quot; Johnson
* Ethel Barrymore as Miss Em
* Ethel Waters as Dicey Johnson

* Evelyn Varden as Melba Wooley
* Raymond Greenleaf as Judge Shoreham
* Juanita Moore as Nurse

==Production==
John Ford was originally hired to direct the film but was replaced after one week because producer Darryl F. Zanuck was unhappy with the dailies.

Both Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge were interested in playing the role of Pinky. In the end, Jeanne Crain was chosen. Elia Kazan, who assumed directing duties when John Ford was fired, was unhappy with the casting choice, and later said, &quot;Jeanne Crain was a sweet girl, but she was like a Sunday school teacher. I did my best with her, but she didn&#x27;t have any fire. The only good thing about her was that it went so far in the direction of no temperament that you felt Pinky was floating through all of her experiences without reacting to them, which is what &#x27;passing&#x27; is.&quot;

==Banning and Supreme Court ruling==
&quot;Pinky&quot; enjoyed wide success in the southern United States, but was banned by the city of Marshall, Texas, for its subject matter. In Marshall, W. L. Gelling managed the segregated Paramount Theater, where blacks were restricted to the balcony. Gelling booked &quot;Pinky&quot; for exhibition in February 1950, a year in which the First Amendment did not protect movies, subsequent to &quot;Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio&quot; (1915).

Marshall&#x27;s city commission &quot;reactivated&quot; the Board of Censors, established by a 1921 ordinance, and designated five members who demanded the submission of the picture for approval. They disapproved its showing, stating that it was &quot;prejudicial to the best interests of the citizens of the City of Marshall.&quot; Gelling exhibited the film anyway and was charged with a misdemeanor. Three board members testified that they objected to the picture because it depicted a white man retaining his love for a woman after learning that she was a Negro, a white man kissing and embracing a Negro woman and two white ruffians assaulting Pinky after she tells them that she is colored.

Gelling was convicted and fined $200. He appealed the conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the case of &quot;W. L. Gelling v. State of Texas&quot; 343 U.S. 960 (1952), the Court then overturned Gelling&#x27;s conviction based on the free-speech protections given to movies in the recently decided case of &quot;Joseph Burstyn, Inc v. Wilson&quot; (1952).

In a concurring opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that the Marshall city ordinance was unconstitutional as it represented prior restraint on free speech. &quot;The evil of prior restraint, condemned...by Burstyn v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 72 S.Ct. 777, in the case of motion pictures, is present here in flagrant form. If a board of censors can tell the American people what it is in their best interests to see or to read or to hear...then thought is regimented, authority substituted for liberty, and the great purpose of the First Amendment to keep uncontrolled the freedom of expression defeated.&quot; In his own concurring opinion, Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote, &quot;This ordinance offends the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on the score of indefiniteness.&quot;

==Box-office performance==
&quot;Pinky&quot; was 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s second-most-successful film of 1949 (after &quot;I Was a Male War Bride&quot;) and the year&#x27;s sixth-highest-grossing.

<text>State Bank of India (SBI) is an Indian multinational public sector bank and financial services statutory body headquartered in Mumbai, Maharashtra. It is the 48th largest bank in the world by total assets and ranked 178th in the &quot;Fortune Global 500&quot; list of the world&#x27;s biggest corporations of 2024, being the only Indian bank on the list. It is a public sector bank and the largest bank in India with a 23% market share by assets and a 25% share of the total loan and deposits market. It is also the tenth largest employer in India with nearly 250,000 employees. In 2024, the company’s seat in Forbes Global 2000 was 55.

On 14 September 2022, State Bank of India became the third lender (after HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank) and the seventh Indian company to cross the 5 trillion market capitalization on the Indian stock exchanges for the first time. The largest public lender in the country reached a milestone in April 2024, when its market capitalization surpassed ₹7 trillion, making it the second public sector undertaking (PSU) to do so, after Life Insurance Corporation of India. In June 2024, SBI crossed all time high market capitalisation of ₹8 trillion (8 lakh crore INR) becoming the 7th Indian company to cross this milestone, and third Indian bank after HDFC and ICICI in terms of market capitalisation. As of December 2024, State Bank of India has a market cap of ₹7.69 Trillion. This makes it the world&#x27;s 200th most valuable company by market cap. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has identified SBI, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank as Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), which are often referred to as banks that are &quot;too big to fail&quot;.

The bank descends from the Bank of Calcutta, founded in 1806 via the Imperial Bank of India, making it the oldest commercial bank in the Indian subcontinent. The Bank of Madras merged into the other two presidency banks in British India, the Bank of Calcutta and the Bank of Bombay, to form the Imperial Bank of India, which in turn became the State Bank of India on July 1, 1955. Overall the bank has been formed from the merger and acquisition of more than twenty banks over the course of its 200-year history. The Government of India took control of the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, with Reserve Bank of India (India&#x27;s central bank) taking a 60% stake, renaming it State Bank of India.

On 16 August 2022, in an attempt to facilitate and support India&#x27;s start-ups, SBI announced the launch of its first &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; dedicated branch for start-ups in Bengaluru.

== History ==

The roots of the State Bank of India lie in the first decade of the 19th century when the Bank of Calcutta (later renamed the Bank of Bengal) was established on 2 June 1806. The Bank of Bengal was one of three Presidency banks, the other two being the Bank of Bombay (incorporated on 15 April 1840) and the Bank of Madras (incorporated on 1 July 1843). All three Presidency banks were incorporated as joint stock companies and were the result of royal charters. These three banks received the exclusive right to issue paper currency till 1861 when, with the Paper Currency Act, the right was taken over by the Government of India. The Presidency banks amalgamated on 27 January 1921, and the re-organised banking entity took as its name Imperial Bank of India. The Imperial Bank of India remained a joint-stock company but without Government participation.

Under the provisions of the State Bank of India Act of 1955, the Reserve Bank of India, which is India&#x27;s central bank, acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India. On 1 July 1955, the Imperial Bank of India became the State Bank of India. In 2008, the Government of India acquired the Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s stake in SBI to remove any conflict of interest because the RBI is the country&#x27;s banking regulatory authority.

In 1959, the government passed the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act. This made eight banks that had belonged to princely states into subsidiaries of SBI. This was at the time of the First Five-Year Plan, which prioritised the development of rural India. The government integrated these banks into the State Bank of India system to expand its rural outreach. In 1963 SBI merged the State Bank of Jaipur (est. 1943) and State Bank of Bikaner (est.1944).

SBI has acquired local banks in rescues. The first was the Bank of Bihar (est. 1911), which SBI acquired in 1969, together with its 28 branches. The next year SBI acquired the National Bank of Lahore (est. 1942), which had 24 branches. Five years later, in 1975, SBI acquired Krishnaram Baldeo Bank, which had been established in 1916 in Gwalior State, under the patronage of Maharaja Madho Rao Scindia. The bank had been the &quot;Dukan Pichadi&quot;, a small moneylender, owned by the Maharaja. The new bank&#x27;s first manager was Jall N. Broacha. In 1985, SBI acquired the Bank of Cochin in Kerala, which had 120 branches. SBI was the acquirer as its affiliate, the State Bank of Travancore, already had an extensive network in Kerala.

National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad designed the SBI logo in 1971. The logo was designed by Shekhar Kamat and the logotype in 14 Indian languages was designed by Mahendra Patel. 

There was, even before it happened, a proposal to merge all the associate banks into SBI to create a single very large bank and streamline operations.

The first step towards unification occurred on 13 August 2008 when State Bank of Saurashtra merged with SBI, reducing the number of associate state banks from seven to six. On 19 June 2009, the SBI board approved the absorption of State Bank of Indore, in which SBI held 98.3%. (Individuals who held the shares before their takeover by the government held the balance of 1.7%.)

The acquisition of State Bank of Indore added 470 branches to SBI&#x27;s existing network of branches. Also, following the acquisition, SBI&#x27;s total assets approached 10 lakh crore. The total assets of SBI and the State Bank of Indore were 9.98 lakh crore as of March 2009. The process of merging of State Bank of Indore was completed by April 2010, and the SBIndore branches started functioning as SBI branches on 26 August 2010.

On 7 October 2013, Arundhati Bhattacharya became the first woman to be appointed chairperson of the bank. Mrs. Bhattacharya received an extension of two years of service to merge into SBI the five remaining associate banks.

In February 2024, State Bank of India began a partnership with Flywire Corporation to make student fees and compliance with the Reserve Bank of India’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) more transparent.

On 30 September 2024, SBI card partnered with Singapore Airlines for KrisFlyer Credit card which can be an attractive choice for frequent travelers.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel John Butler ( – May 12, 1796) was a British Indian Department officer, landowner and merchant. During the American Revolutionary War, he was a prominent Loyalist who commanded Butler&#x27;s Rangers. Born in New London, Connecticut, he moved to New York with his family, where he learned several Iroquoian languages and worked as an interpreter in the fur trade. He was well-prepared to work with the Mohawk and other Iroquois nations who became allies of the British during the rebellion.

During the Revolutionary War, Butler persuaded the Seneca and Cayuga to participate in the St. Leger&#x27;s Expedition in New York. Afterwards he was given permission to raise a &quot;corps of rangers&quot; to work closely with Britain&#x27;s Indigenous allies. Butler&#x27;s Rangers participated in raids in New York and Pennsylvania, including the Battle of Wyoming and the Cherry Valley massacre. After the war Butler resettled in Upper Canada, where he was given a grant of land by the Crown for his services. Butler continued his leadership in the developing colony, serving in public office, and helping to establish the Anglican Church and the Masonic Order in what is now Ontario.

==Early life==
John Butler, the son of Walter Butler and Deborah Ely, was born in 1728 in New London, Connecticut. In 1742, his father moved the family to Fort Hunter on the frontier in the Mohawk Valley near the modern village of Fonda, New York. John married Catharine (Catalyntje) Bradt of Dutch ancestry about 1752. The couple raised five children including Walter Butler. Two others died in infancy. Having learned several Iroquoian languages, Butler was frequently employed as an interpreter in the lucrative fur trade.

==French and Indian War==
In 1755, John Butler was appointed to the rank of lieutenant in the British Indian Department. He served in the French and Indian War under Sir William Johnson and was promoted to captain. In 1758, he saw action with James Abercromby at Fort Ticonderoga and John Bradstreet at the Battle of Fort Frontenac. In 1759, he served under Johnson as second-in-command of the Indigenous forces at the Battle of Fort Niagara, where he played a crucial role in flanking the French reinforcements. In 1760, he continued as second-in-command of the Indigenous warriors in Jeffery Amherst&#x27;s force during the capture of Montreal.

==Pre-American Revolution years==
After the war, Butler returned to the Mohawk Valley in New York. He acquired more land, building an estate of at Butlersbury near the major Mohawk village of Caughnawaga. He was second only to Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, as a wealthy frontier landowner, and worked under Johnson for the British Indian Department. In 1772, Butler was appointed a judge in the Tryon County court and was commissioned Lieutenant Colonel of Guy Johnson&#x27;s regiment of Tryon County militia. Butler was elected as one of the two members representing Tryon County in the New York assembly.

==American Revolutionary War==

John Butler returned to service, as a Loyalist, when the American Revolution turned to war in 1775. In May 1775, he left for Canada in the company of Daniel Claus, Walter Butler, Hon Yost Schuyler and Joseph Brant, a Mohawk leader. On July 7, they reached Fort Oswego and in August, Montreal. Butler participated in the defence of Montreal against an attack led by Ethan Allen. In November, Guy Carleton, Governor of the Province of Quebec, sent Butler to Fort Niagara with instructions to keep the Iroquois neutral. His son, Walter, enlisted as an ensign in the 8th Regiment of Foot, but his wife and other children were detained by the American rebels.

In March 1776, John Butler sent a party of about 100 allied warriors to Montreal to force the Americans out of Quebec. In May 1777, he received instructions to bring as many Iroquois warriors as he could to Fort Oswego for an attack on Fort Stanwix as a part of the Saratoga Campaign. Butler persuaded about 350 Seneca and Cayuga warriors to participate, and was appointed second-in-command of the Indigenous forces under Daniel Claus.

Butler successfully coordinated the ambush of rebel militia and Oneida warriors at the Battle of Oriskany. As a result he was commissioned a Major and given authority to raise his own regiment, which became known as Butler&#x27;s Rangers, initially with a strength of eight companies. He returned to Fort Niagara, and completed recruiting the first company in December. 

In July 1778, Butler led his Rangers and Indigenous allies at the Battle of Wyoming, in which he defeated Lieutenant-Colonel Zebulon Butler&#x27;s militia and Continentals and captured Forty Fort. Later, the battle was referred to as the &quot;Wyoming Massacre&quot; because of the many Patriots who were killed and scalped as they fled the battlefield. In the days following the battle, homes, barns and mills in the area were looted and burned, however, the inhabitants were not harmed.

Butler commanded his Rangers from his headquarters at Fort Niagara. In 1779, he was defeated at the Battle of Newtown, the only major engagement of the Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois. He was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel in the winter of 1780.

In 1780, Butler commanded the four companies of Rangers that participated in the large-scale raid on the Schoharie and Mohawk valleys. The raid culminated in the inconclusive Battle of Klock&#x27;s Field on October 19, 1780. Later in the war, the Rangers were active from Niagara to Illinois County, Virginia. 

==Post-war years and death==

At the end of the Revolution, John Butler was given a land grant in the Niagara region by the Crown for his services during the war and as compensation for his property in New York having been confiscated. He developed it for agriculture. He became one of the political leaders of Upper Canada, later called Ontario. He was appointed as a Deputy Superintendent for the Indian Department, a Justice of the Peace, and the local militia commander. He was also prominent in establishing the Anglican Church and Masonic Order in what is now Ontario. Butler worked with his superior in the Indian Department, Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet, in negotiating the acquisition (Johnson-Butler Purchase or Gunshot Treaty of 1787-1788) of lands east of the Toronto Purchase of 1787.

Butler died, at his home, at age 68 in Niagara, Upper Canada, British Canada, now Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, on May 12, 1796. His wife had died three years previously. Butler was survived by three sons and a daughter. John Butler is interred in the family burial ground in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.

==Legacy==

*Col. John Butler School in Niagara-on-the-Lake was named after him, as are numerous other public and private establishments, including a Best Western Hotel, a sports bar, a street leading to the family burial ground on land that was his former property, and the Butler&#x27;s Barracks established after the War of 1812. The latter has been designated as a National Historic Site.
*In 2006, a life-sized bronze bust of Butler was installed at the Valiants Memorial in Ottawa. Alongside Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, he is considered a key player in the founding of British North America and late eighteenth-century Canada.
*In 2010, a bust was installed on top of a memorial cairn at the site of his homestead on Balmoral Drive in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.

<text>The Gibson ES-150 is a pioneering electric guitar produced by Gibson Guitar Corporation. Introduced in 1936, it is generally recognized as the world&#x27;s first commercially successful Spanish-style electric guitar. The ES stands for Electric Spanish, and Gibson designated it &quot;150&quot; because they priced it (in an instrument/amplifier/cable bundle) at around $150 (). The particular sound of the instrument came from a combination of the specific bar-style pickup and its placement, and the guitar&#x27;s overall construction. 

Unlike the usual acoustic guitars in jazz bands of the period, it was loud enough to take a more prominent position in ensembles. Upon its debut it immediately became popular with such notable guitar players as Charlie Christian, spreading its renown. Gibson produced the guitar with minor variations until 1940, when the ES-150 designation (the &quot;V2&quot;) denoted a model with a different construction and pickup.

==History==
Gibson&#x27;s previous electrified guitars were either primitive piezoelectric systems or sold as an add-on for their traditional line of acoustic guitars.

The ES-150 was preceded by Gibson adding ancillary piezo pickups to its regular acoustic guitars. The company had developed an electromagnetic pickup in 1935 (the now-famous &quot;bar pickup&quot;, named for its shape), which was initially factory-installed only on lap steel guitar (EH) models, then offered as an accessory and finally installed on acoustic guitars (the L-00 and L-1 models).
These electrified guitars were so successful that in the summer of 1936 two US retailers, Montgomery Ward and Spiegel, suggested that Gibson build what became the ES model. Montgomery Ward was the first to offer them for sale, as the 1270 model. It had Gibson&#x27;s bar pickup (though with rounded bobbins, as opposed to the hexagonal pickup Gibson later installed on its own factory models), and a volume control (no tone control); like Spiegel&#x27;s 34-S model (first advertised in 1937) it lacked any Gibson identification. Spiegel received 42 of these instruments between January and August 1937 before it cut them from the catalog. The contract with Montgomery Ward ran until 1940, and Gibson made an estimated 900 instruments with the 1270 designation.

Gibson&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; ES-150, a &quot;more-upmarket ES model&quot; compared to the Ward and Spiegel models, had minor changes from the contract models, such as a solid carved spruce top, maple back and sides, and an adjustable truss rod. They shipped the first guitar to Bailey&#x27;s House of Music on November 20, 1936. The instrument sold for $155 including cord, six-tube amplifier, and case. The pickup placement, closer to the instrument&#x27;s neck than on Gibson&#x27;s EH steel guitars and on guitars made by other manufacturers, produced a warmer, less &quot;trebly&quot; tone that was favorably received by jazz and blues players. In 1937, the model&#x27;s peak year, Gibson shipped an average of forty guitars a month. In early 1937, Gibson began shipping two four-string versions: a tenor guitar (the EST-150, with a 23&quot; scale, renamed the ETG-150 in 1940) and a plectrum version (the EPG-150, with a 27&quot; scale). Early players included Eddie Durham, Floyd Smith and, the most famous of them, Charlie Christian, who bought an ES-150 in 1936. His joining the Benny Goodman Sextet in August 1939 gave the ES-150 &quot;a near-mythical status&quot; (aided by a feature in that year&#x27;s December issue of &quot;Down Beat&quot;).

Gibson introduced two new variations in August 1938: the cheaper ES-100 (with a smaller body and different pickup), and an upscale version, the ES-250 (with a different peghead, fancier inlays, and a pickup with individual pole pieces instead of a bar). Each with case and amplifier, the ES-100 sold for $117.50 () and the ES-250 started at $253 (). 
By 1940, sales had slumped, and Gibson enhanced the model, changing to pickups with Alnico magnets—the forerunner of the P-90, which is still in production. They installed the new pickups on all their electric models, starting in July 1940, renaming the ES-100 and 250 to ES-125 and 300). On the ES-150, Gibson moved the pickup (with adjustable individual poles) closer to the bridge for a more &quot;biting&quot; sound for soloing. Gibson still installed bar-style pickups on request on post-1940 models for Hank Garland, Barry Galbraith, and Barney Kessel. Gibson formally reintroduced the bar pickup in 1958 as a $60 option () — announcing it with the question, &quot;Remember the straight-bar pickup that was made famous by Charlie Christian?&quot;

==Later models==
In the late 1960s, Gibson introduced the ES-150DC, which was a significantly different instrument, despite its similar model number. The ES-150DC was a hollowbody electric guitar with a double-cutaway body similar in appearance to the semi-hollow 335 guitars (except for a greater body thickness). It featured two humbuckers, a rosewood fingerboard with small block inlays, and a master volume knob on the lower cutaway. This model, however, was not particularly popular, and it was discontinued by Gibson in the mid-1970s. 

==Production numbers==
Shipping numbers for the ES-150 in its first full year, 1937, were relatively strong at 464. Thirty-seven EST-150s and one single EPG-150 were shipped in 1937. Of the ES-250, 14 were shipped in 1939. By that year, sales of the ES-150 had dwindled to about 20 units on average per month.

==&quot;Charlie Christian pickup&quot;==
The &quot;Charlie Christian pickup&quot;, as the bar-style pickup of the early ES-150 models came to be known, was a departure from previous pickups. Earlier pickups featured either a horseshoe magnet that arched over the strings (as found on the Rickenbacker A-22 &quot;Frying Pan&quot;), or a static coil through which a magnet passed, the magnet being vibrated by the guitar&#x27;s bridge (a design used by former Gibson employee Lloyd Loar on his Vivi-Tone guitar). The Charlie Christian pickup consists of a coil of copper wire wound around a black plastic bobbin. The coil has a rectangular hole in its center, and the coil and bobbin fit around a chrome-plated steel blade polepiece. Attached at right angles to the bottom of the polepiece are a pair of steel bar magnets, which remain out of sight inside the instrument. These magnets are secured to the top of the ES-150 by the three bolts visible on the guitar&#x27;s top.

Gibson made three varieties of the Charlie Christian pickup, all distinguished by the polepiece:

# The first, produced from 1936 until mid-1938, had a plain blade polepiece. The coil was wound to about 2.4 kΩ resistance using AWG 38 enameled wire.
# The second type, introduced on ES-150s from mid-1938 onward, had a polepiece with a notch cut out below the second (B) string. This modification lowered the B string&#x27;s volume, which previously sounded louder than the other strings. This pickup&#x27;s coil was wound with more turns of a finer wire (AWG 42), producing approximately 5.2 kΩ resistance and higher output.
# The third pickup was available on the Gibson ES-250, beginning in 1939. The blade on this pickup had five notches, one in each string space. This pickup had a more compact internal design, with a cobalt steel slug that was small enough to sit directly under the pickup.

===Sound===
Charlie Christian pickups produce a clear sound because of their narrow string-sensing blade — and a strong signal because of their relatively high coil impedance. Uneven magnetic flux within the steel magnets can cause some distortion in the signal. These pickups are relatively sensitive to electromagnetic hum because of their large surface area and lack of shielding.

In a article discussing the sound and history of the Charlie Christian pickup, vintage guitar dealer Phil Emerson wrote:
Largely due to the influence of Charlie Christian himself, numerous 20th century guitarists performed and recorded using instruments equipped with versions of the Charlie Christian pickup. These include the following: T-Bone Walker, Tiny Grimes, Oscar Moore, Barney Kessel, Alvino Rey, Jimmy Raney, Rene’ Thomas, Jimmy Gourley, Tal Farlow, Tony Mottola, Mary Osborne, Barry Galbraith, Elek Bacsik, Dennis Budimir, Dave Barbour, Eddie Duran, Hank Garland, Kenny Burrell, Louis Stewart.

<text>Durdle Door (sometimes written Durdle Dor) is a natural limestone arch on the Jurassic Coast near Lulworth in Dorset, England. It is privately owned by the Weld family, who own the Lulworth Estate, but it is also open to the public.

== Geology ==
The form of the coastline around Durdle Door is controlled by its geology—both by the contrasting hardnesses of the rocks, and by the local patterns of faults and folds. The arch has formed on a concordant coastline where bands of rock run parallel to the shoreline. The rock strata are almost vertical, and the bands of rock are quite narrow. Originally a band of resistant Portland limestone ran along the shore, the same band that appears one mile along the coast forming the narrow entrance to Lulworth Cove. Behind this is a band of weaker, easily eroded rocks, and behind this is a stronger and much thicker band of chalk, which forms the Purbeck Hills. These steeply dipping rocks are part of the Lulworth crumple, itself part of the broader Purbeck Monocline, produced by the building of the Alps during the mid-Cenozoic.
The limestone and chalk are in closer proximity at Durdle Door than at Swanage, to the east, where the distance is over .
Around this part of the coast, nearly all of the limestone has been removed by sea erosion, whilst the remainder forms the small headland which includes the arch. Erosion at the western end of the limestone band has resulted in the arch formation. UNESCO teams monitor the condition of both the arch and adjacent beach.

The isthmus that joins the limestone to the chalk is made of a band of Portland limestone, a narrow and compressed band of Cretaceous Wealden clays and sands, and then narrow bands of greensand and sandstone.

In Man O&#x27; War Bay, the small bay immediately east of Durdle Door, the band of Portland and Purbeck limestone has not been entirely eroded and is visible above the waves as Man O&#x27;War Rocks. Similarly, offshore to the west, the eroded limestone outcrop forms a line of small rocky islets called (from east to west) The Bull, The Blind Cow, The Cow, and The Calf.

As the coastline in this area is generally an eroding landscape, the cliffs are subject to occasional rockfalls and landslides; a particularly large slide occurred just to the east of Durdle Door in April 2013, destroying a part of the South West Coast Path.

== Etymology ==
There is a dearth of early written records about the arch, though it has kept a name given to it probably over a thousand years ago. In the late 18th century there is a description of the &quot;magnificent arch of Durdle-rock Door&quot;, and early 19th-century maps called it &quot;Duddledoor&quot; and &quot;Durdle&quot; or &quot;Dudde Door&quot;. In 1811 the first Ordnance Survey map of the area named it &quot;Dirdale Door&quot;. &quot;Durdle&quot; is derived from the Old English , meaning to pierce, bore or drill, which in turn derives from , meaning hole. Similar names in the region include Durlston Bay and Durlston Head further east, where a coastal stack suggests the existence of an earlier arch, and the Thurlestone, an arched rock in the neighbouring county of Devon to the west. The &quot;Door&quot; part of the name probably maintains its modern meaning, referring to the arched shape of the rock; in the late 19th century there is a reference to it being called the &quot;Barn-door&quot;, and it is described as being &quot;sufficiently high for a good-sized sailing boat to pass through it.&quot;
== In literature and popular culture ==
Music videos have been filmed at Durdle Door, including parts of Tears for Fears&#x27; &quot;Shout&quot;, Billy Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Loverboy&quot;, Cliff Richard&#x27;s &quot;Saviour&#x27;s Day&quot; and Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;Tears of the Dragon&quot;.

The landscape around Durdle Door has been used in scenes in several films, including &quot;Wilde&quot; (1997) starring Stephen Fry, &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; starring Emma Thompson, the 1967 production of &quot;Far From The Madding Crowd&quot; (the latter also filmed around nearby Scratchy Bottom), and the Bollywood film &quot;Housefull 3&quot;. In 2022, Durdle Door was where the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) regenerated into the Fourteenth Doctor (David Tennant), in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;. Ron Dawson&#x27;s children&#x27;s story &quot;Scary Bones meets the Dinosaurs of the Jurassic Coast&quot; creates a myth of how Durdle Door came to be, as an &#x27;undiscovered&#x27; dinosaur called &quot;Durdle Doorus&quot; is magically transformed into rock.

Dorset-born Arthur Moule, a friend of Thomas Hardy and missionary to China wrote these lines about Durdle Door for his 1879 book of poetry &quot;Songs of Heaven and home, written in a foreign Land&quot;:

It is in the south of the county, immediately north of Slough (with which it is contiguous), and around 22 miles west of Charing Cross, Central London. Within the parish boundary is the village of Farnham Common and the hamlet of Farnham Park.

==History==

The village name &#x27;Farnham&#x27; is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;homestead where ferns grow&#x27;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as &quot;Ferneham&quot;.

The affix or suffix &#x27;Royal&#x27; was given to the village in the late 11th century by the king, who gave the lord of the manor of Farnham, Bertram de Verdun, the Grand Serjeanty on the condition of providing a glove and putting it on the king&#x27;s right hand at the coronation, and supporting his right arm, while the Royal sceptre was in his hand (see also Manor of Worksop).

In 1832, Francis Osborne was created &quot;Baron Godolphin, of Farnham Royal in the County of Buckingham&quot;.

From 1952 to 1957, Barnardo&#x27;s operated a home for girls at Long Close on Black Pond Lane.

==Amenities==

The two largest categories of land use are green space which is forest or golf course (Burnham Beeches which has a hotel and café) and secondly domestic gardens which accounted for 34% of land use as at the 2011 census.

At a focal point of the developed village hub, on the site of two mini-roundabouts, stood the old water pump, removed in the 1970s to a museum. Just after 2000 the water pump was brought back is on the green nearby, next to &quot;the Duke&#x27;s Head&quot; pub.

Farnham Park National Baseball &amp; Softball Complex, the UK&#x27;s only purpose-built baseball and softball facility, is also located within Farnham Park Playing Fields, and is operated by BaseballSoftball&quot;UK&quot;.

Farnham Park also plays host to Farnham Royal Rugby Club, formerly Old Pennanians Rugby Club. Founded in 1962, the club has always played in Farnham Park and is drenched in Rugby history. The Australian Rugby World Cup winning side of 1999 trained at Farnham Royal Rugby Club and made the 1st Team captain, Oli Isernia, an honorary squad member who was present with them upon their win and was invited to the changing room and trophy ceremony. 
Presently, Farnham Royal Rugby Club play out of Farnham Park in the Bucks, Berks and Oxon 3 South League, after obtaining promotion in the 2022/23 season.

<text>Farnham Common is a village in
southern Buckinghamshire, England, 3 miles north of Slough and 3 miles south of Beaconsfield, on the A355 road. It adjoins the ancient woodland of Burnham Beeches, has an area of 2.5 miles and a population of around 6,000. It is in the civil parish of Farnham Royal.

==History==

Farnham Royal was the main village with its church of St Mary&#x27;s, shops, cottages and village pump situated in the centre junction of the cross roads. Farnham Common was known as &#x27;Up End&#x27;, being the common land of the parish where the livestock was grazed at certain times of the year. As this common area became more populated it became known as Farnham Common.

Farnham Common is on the border of Burnham Beeches, the well known Beech forest owned by the City of London Corporation, having been given to the people of London as a place in the country for their recreation and pleasure. In the 1920s it was very common for coach loads of Londoners to come down for the day at weekends having tea at the tea rooms and enjoying the donkey rides.

A few of the large old houses still remain such as Yew Place, Farnham Park House and the home of Caldicott. Yew Place was formerly known as The Rectory, part of which dates back to the time of King John. The original farmhouse was given to a coachman in the service of the Earl of Warwick. The Chase, now known as Farnham Park House, was owned by Mr Carr Gomme, a very influential member of the community, being one of the main organisers of fund-raisers for the building of St John&#x27;s Church. The house passed into the hands of Sir Gomer Berry, later Lord Kemsley, who had the organ dismantled from Farnham Park House and gave it to St John&#x27;s Church. In 1948 Farnham Park house became the Farnham Park Rehabilitation Centre, a renowned sports injury hospital owned by the East Berkshire Health Authority until its closure in 1988. In 1996 Farnham Park House was re-established as a private residence.

Caldicott is large house situated on the edge of Burnham Beeches and was once owned by Mrs Harvey who gave money for the extension of Farnham Common Village Hall. Caldicott is now a boys&#x27; preparatory school.

A few names of note who have been associated with Farnham Common have been the artist Rex Whistler&#x27;s mother, who lived in The Small House in Burnham Beeches; J. M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan and Enid Blyton, the children&#x27;s author. In Burnham Beeches there is a large beech tree under which Felix Mendelssohn used to sit and compose some of his works in &#x27;peaceful splendour&#x27;. Joan Hammond, the opera singer, lived in the part of the village known as Egypt. The Moore family live in the village and hold the record of three generations of one family representing Great Britain in the Olympic Games, Major George Moore having competed in 1948, Lieut. Col. John Moore, his son, in 1956, 1960 and 1964 and Lieut. Mark Moore, his grandson, in 1984. Lieut. Col. John Moore was appointed OBE for his services to skiing. Lois Allan invented Fuzzy Felt in her cottage in the village during World War II.

More recently, Burnham Beeches has been used as a film set for some of the Harry Potter films, including the Order of the Phoenix and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.

==Facilities==
A small high street includes numerous businesses, stores, eateries and shops.

The National Baseball &amp; Softball Complex at Farnham Park is located just south of the village, between Farnham Royal and Slough. It is the home of the Great Britain Baseball and Great Britain Softball Olympic National Teams, and is the largest complex of its kind in the United Kingdom.

<text>The Petkau effect is an early counterexample to linear-effect assumptions usually made about radiation exposure. It was found by Dr. Abram Petkau at the Atomic Energy of Canada Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment, Manitoba and published in Health Physics March 1972. The Petkau effect was coined by Swiss nuclear hazards commentator Ralph Graeub in 1985 in this book &quot;Der Petkau-Effekt und unsere strahlende Zukunft&quot; (The Petkau effect and our Radiating Future).

Petkau had been measuring, in the usual way, the radiation dose that would rupture a simulated artificial cell membrane. He found that 3500 rads delivered in  hours (26 rad/min = 15.5 Sv/h) would do it. Then, almost by chance, Petkau repeated the experiment with much weaker radiation and found that 0.7 rad delivered in  hours (1 millirad/min = 0.61 mSv/h) also ruptured the membrane. This was counter to the prevailing assumption of a linear relationship between total dose or dose rate and the consequences.

The radiation was of ionizing nature, and produced negative oxygen ions (free radicals). Those ions were more damaging to the simulated membrane in lower concentrations than higher (a somewhat counter-intuitive result in itself) because in the latter, they more readily recombine with each other instead of interfering with the membrane. The ion concentration directly correlated with the radiation dose rate and the composition had non-monotonic consequences.

==Radio-protective effects of superoxide dismutase==

Petkau conducted further experiments with simulated cells in 1976 and found that the enzyme superoxide dismutase protected the cells from free radicals generated by ionizing radiation, obviating the effects seen in his earlier experiment. Petkau also discovered that superoxide dismutase was elevated in the leukocytes (white blood cells) in a sub-population of nuclear workers occupationally exposed to elevated radiation (&quot;ca&quot;. 10 mSv in 6 months), further supporting the hypothesis that superoxide dismutase is a radioprotective agent. Thus, Petkau&#x27;s original 1972 experiment apparently revealed the potential effects of ionizing radiation on cells without natural radioprotective mechanisms in place.

<text>Thekla&#x27;s lark (Galerida theklae), also known as the Thekla lark, is a species of lark that breeds on the Iberian Peninsula, in northern Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Somalia. It is a sedentary (non-migratory) species. This is a common bird of dry open country, often at some altitude. Thekla&#x27;s lark was named by Alfred Edmund Brehm in 1857 for his recently deceased sister Thekla Brehm (1833–1857). The name is a modern Greek one, Θέκλα (), which comes from ancient Greek Θεόκλεια (Theokleia) derived from (, &quot;god&quot;) and (kleos, &quot;glory&quot; or &quot;honour&quot;). The population is declining in Spain, but this is a common bird with a very wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Thekla&#x27;s lark has several East African subspecies that show deep genetic divergence both among themselves and from the Mediterranean populations and are consequently strong candidates for consideration as separate species. Formerly, some authorities considered Thekla&#x27;s lark and the Malabar lark to be conspecific. Alternate names for Thekla&#x27;s lark include short-crested lark and Thekla crested-lark.

=== Subspecies ===
Twelve subspecies are recognized: 
* &quot;G. t. theklae&quot; - : Also known as Iberian Thekla&#x27;s lark. Found in Portugal, Spain, Balearic Islands and extreme southern France
* North Moroccan Thekla&#x27;s lark (&quot;G. t. erlangeri&quot;) - : Found in northern Morocco
* Central Moroccan Thekla&#x27;s lark (&quot;G. t. ruficolor&quot;) - : Found in central and north-eastern Morocco, northern Algeria and northern Tunisia
* &quot;G. t. theresae&quot; - : Found in south-western Morocco and Mauritania
* Hauts Plateaux Thekla&#x27;s lark (&quot;G. t. superflua&quot;) - : Found in eastern Morocco, northern Algeria and eastern Tunisia
* North African Thekla&#x27;s lark (&quot;G. t. carolinae&quot;) - : Found in eastern Morocco through the northern Sahara to north-western Egypt
* &quot;G. t. harrarensis&quot; - : Found in eastern Ethiopia
* &quot;G. t. huei&quot; - : Found in south-central Ethiopia
* Abyssinian Thekla&#x27;s lark (&quot;G. t. praetermissa&quot;) - : Found in southern Eritrea to central Ethiopia
* Somali Thekla&#x27;s lark (&quot;G. t. ellioti&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in northern and central Somalia
* &quot;G. t. mallablensis&quot; - : Found in southern Somalia
* &quot;G. t. huriensis&quot; - : Found in southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya

==Description==
This is a smallish lark, slightly smaller than the Eurasian skylark. It has a long, spiky, erectile crest. It is greyer than the Eurasian skylark, and lacks the white wing and tail edge of that species. It is very similar to the widespread crested lark. It is smaller and somewhat greyer than that species, and has a shorter bill. In flight, it shows grey underwings, whereas the crested lark has reddish underwings. The body is mainly dark-streaked grey above and whitish below. The sexes are similar.

==Distribution and habitat==
Thekla&#x27;s lark is native and resident in France, Spain, Portugal, Algeria, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, Tunisia and Western Sahara. Its typical habitat is rugged areas with scrub, bare patches of ground and semi-arid grassland.

==Behaviour and ecology==

It nests on the ground, laying two to six eggs. Its food is weed, seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.

The song is melodious and varied, with mournful whistles and mimicry included. It is softer and more tuneful than that of the crested lark, and may be sung during flight or from the ground or an exposed perch.

<doc id="403043" wikidata="Q76580" url="?curid=403043" title="Cum shot">
<text>A cum shot is the depiction of human ejaculation, especially onto another person. The term is usually applied to depictions occurring in pornographic films, photographs, and magazines. Unlike ejaculation in non-pornographic sex, cum shots typically involve ejaculation outside the receiver&#x27;s body, allowing the viewer to see the ejaculation in progress. Facial cum shots (or &quot;facials&quot;) are regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene. Cum shots may also depict ejaculation onto another performer&#x27;s body, such as on the genitals, buttocks, chest or tongue.

The term is typically used by the cinematographer within the narrative framework of a pornographic film, and, since the 1970s, it has become a leitmotif of the hardcore genre. Two exceptions are softcore pornography, in which penetration is not explicitly shown, and &quot;couples erotica&quot;, which may involve penetration but is typically filmed in a more discreet manner intended to be romantic or educational rather than graphic. Softcore pornography that does not contain ejaculation sequences is produced both to respond to a demand by some consumers for less-explicit pornographic material and to comply with government regulations or cable company rules that may disallow depictions of ejaculation. Cum shots typically do not appear in &quot;girl-girl&quot; scenes (female ejaculation scenes exist, but are relatively uncommon); orgasm is instead implied by utterances, cinematic conventions, or body movement.

Cum shots have become the object of fetish genres like bukkake, in which the cum shot replaces the sex act completely.

==Terminology==
A cum shot may also be called a &quot;cumshot&quot;, &quot;come shot&quot;, &quot;cum blast&quot;, &quot;pop shot&quot; or &quot;money shot&quot;.

Originally, in general film-making usage the term &quot;money shot&quot; was a reference to the scene that cost the most money to produce; in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence is being counted on to become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of an explosion might be called the &quot;money shot&quot; of the film. The use of &quot;money shot&quot; to denote the ejaculation scene in pornographic films is attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it. The meaning of the term &quot;money shot&quot; has sometimes been borrowed back from pornography by the film and TV industry with a meaning closer to that used in pornographic films. For example, in TV talk shows, the term, borrowed from pornography, denotes a highly emotional scene, expressed in visible bodily terms.

==Origin and features==

Although earlier pornographic films occasionally contained footage of ejaculation, it was not until the advent of hard-core pornography in the 1970s that the stereotypical cum shot scene became a standard feature—displaying ejaculation with maximum visibility. The 1972 film &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; featured a seven-minute-long sequence described by Linda Williams, professor of film studies, as &quot;optically printed, psychedelically colored doublings of the ejaculating penis&quot;. Steven Ziplow&#x27;s &quot;The Film Maker&#x27;s Guide to Pornography&quot; (1977) states:

Cum shot scenes may involve the female actor calling for the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body. Cultural analysis researcher Murat Aydemir considers this one of the three quintessential aspects of the cum shot scene, alongside the emphasis on visible ejaculation and the timing of the cum shot, which usually concludes a hard-core scene.

As a possible alternative explanation for the rise of the cum shot in hardcore pornography, Joseph Slade, professor at Ohio University and author of &quot;Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide&quot; notes that pornography actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude.

==Health risks==

===Transmission of disease===
Any sexual activity that involves contact with the bodily fluids of another person contains the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed. However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and hepatitis. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration categorizes semen as &quot;other potentially infectious material&quot; or OPIM.

Aside from other sexual activity that may have occurred prior to performing a facial, the risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner, there is almost no risk of contracting an STD. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher. Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive mucous membranes (e.g., eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease.

===Allergic reactions===
In rare cases, people have been known to experience allergic reactions to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma hypersensitivity. Symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include hives and even difficulty breathing.

Options for prevention of semen allergy include avoiding exposure to seminal fluid by use of condoms and attempting desensitization. Treatment options include diphenhydramine and/or an injection of epinephrine.

==Criticisms and responses==
One critic of &quot;cum shot&quot; scenes in heterosexual pornography was the US porn star–turned–writer, director and producer Candida Royalle. She produced pornography films aimed at women and their partners that avoid the &quot;misogynous predictability&quot; and depiction of sex in &quot;...as grotesque and graphic [a way] as possible.&quot; Royalle also criticizes the male-centredness of the typical pornography film, in which scenes end when the male actor ejaculates.

Women&#x27;s activist Beatrice Faust argued, &quot;since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism. This occurs in both homosexual and pornography so that ejaculation cannot be interpreted as an expression of contempt for women only.&quot;
She goes on to say &quot;Logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is as healthy as sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture.&quot;

Sexologist Peter Sándor Gardos argues that his research suggests that &quot;... the men who get most turned on by watching cum shots are the ones who have positive attitudes toward women&quot; (at the annual meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex in 1992). Later, at the World Pornography Conference in 1998, he reported a similar conclusion, namely that &quot;no pornographic image is interpretable outside of its historical and social context. Harm or degradation does not reside in the image itself.&quot;

Cindy Patton, activist and scholar on human sexuality, argues that, in western culture, male sexual fulfillment is synonymous with orgasm and that the male orgasm is an essential punctuation of the sexual narrative. No orgasm, no sexual pleasure. No cum shot, no narrative closure. The cum shot is the period at the end of the sentence.

In her essay &quot;Visualizing Safe Sex: When Pedagogy and Pornography Collide&quot;, Patton reached the conclusion that critics have devoted too little space to discovering the meaning that viewers attach to specific acts such as cum shots.

<doc id="403045" wikidata="Q691761" url="?curid=403045" title="Keynsham">
<text>Keynsham ( ) is a town and civil parish located on the outskirts of the city of Bristol on the A4 that links the cities of Bristol and Bath in Somerset, England. It had a population of 19,603 at the 2021 Census. It was listed in the Domesday Book as &quot;Cainesham&quot; (as it is pronounced), which is believed to mean the home of Saint Keyne.

The site of the town has been occupied since prehistoric times, and may have been the site of the Roman settlement of Trajectus. The remains of at least two Roman villas have been excavated, and an additional 15 Roman buildings have been detected beneath the Keynsham Hams. Keynsham developed into a medieval market town after Keynsham Abbey was founded around 1170. It is situated at the confluence of the River Chew and River Avon and was subject to serious flooding before the creation of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock in 1727. The Chew Stoke flood of 1968 inundated large parts of the town. It was home to the Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate factory, Somerdale, which opened in 1935 as a major employer in the town.

It is home to Memorial Park, which is used for the annual town festival and several nature reserves. The town is served by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes and is close to the A4 road which bypassed the town in 1964. There are schools, religious, sporting, and cultural clubs and venues.

==History==

===Roman Trajectus===
Evidence of occupation dates back to prehistoric times, and during the Roman period, Keynsham may have been the site of the Roman settlement of Trajectus, which is the Latin word for &quot;bridgehead.&quot; It is believed that a settlement around a Roman ford over the River Avon existed somewhere in the vicinity, and the numerous Roman ruins discovered in Keynsham make it a likely candidate for this lost settlement.

In 1877 during construction of the Durley Hill Cemetery, the remains of a grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, construction of the cemetery went ahead, and the majority of the villa is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.

At the same time as the grand Roman villa was being excavated at Durley Hill Cemetery, a second smaller villa was discovered during the construction of Fry&#x27;s Somerdale Chocolate Factory. Two fine stone coffins were found, interred with the remains of a man and a woman. The villa and coffins were removed to a place near the gates of the factory grounds, and construction on the factory went ahead. Fry&#x27;s built in the grounds of the factory a museum which for many years housed the Durley Hill mosaics, the coffins, and numerous other artefacts. In 2012, Taylor Wimpey, about to develop the factory site, made a detailed geophysical assessment of the area, and discovered an additional 15 Roman buildings centered around a Roman road beneath Keynsham Hams, with evidence of additional Roman buildings that had been disturbed by quarrying.

===Medieval Keynsham===
According to legend, Saint Keyne, daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog (Brecon), lived here on the banks of the River Avon during the 5th century. Before settling here, she had been warned by the local King that the marshy area was swarming with snakes, which prevented habitation. St Keyne prayed to the heavens and turned the snakes to stone. The fossil ammonites found in the area were believed to be the result. However, there is no evidence that her cult was ever celebrated in Keynsham.

Some scattered archeological evidence suggests that an Anglo-Saxon settlement existed in Keynsham in the High Street area, and that in the 9th century a Minster church existed in Keynsham as well. The earliest documentary reference to Keynsham is in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, (c. 980) which refers to it as &quot;Cægineshamme,&quot; Old English for &#x27;Cæga&#x27;s Hamm.&#x27; The town is also listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Cainesham.&quot; It has therefore been suggested that the origin of Keynsham&#x27;s name is not, in fact Saint Keyne, but from &quot;Ceagin (Caega).&quot;

Around 1170, Keynsham Abbey was founded by the Victorine congregation of canon regulars. Archeological evidence suggests that the abbey was built over the site of the previous Saxon Minster church. The settlement developed into a medieval market town, and the abbey of Keynsham was given ownership of the Keynsham Hundred.
The abbey survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539, and a house was subsequently built on the site. The remains have been designated as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.

===Stuart era===
Keynsham played a part in the Civil War as the Roundheads occupied the town and also camped there for the night, using the pub now known as the Lock Keeper Inn as a guard post. During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth. Bridges Almshouses were built around 1685 and may have been for the widows of those killed in the rebellion.

===Post World War II===

Keynsham rose to fame during the late 1950s and early 1960s when it featured in a long-running series of advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for Horace Batchelor&#x27;s Infra-draw betting system. To obtain the system, listeners had to write to Batchelor&#x27;s Keynsham post office box, and Keynsham was always painstakingly spelled out on-air, with Batchelor famously intoning &quot;Keynsham – spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M – Keynsham, Bristol&quot;. This was done because the proper pronunciation of Keynsham – &quot;Cane-sham&quot; – does not make the spelling of Keynsham immediately obvious to the radio listener.

Since the 1950s Keynsham has become a dormitory town for Bristol and Bath. The High Street shopping area has been remodelled, and a Town Hall, Library, and Clock Tower were built in the mid-1960s.

Before the creation of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated large parts of the town, destroying the town&#x27;s bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh. After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after World War II was extended.

===2010s regeneration===
Design work for regeneration of the town hall area was awarded by Bath and North East Somerset Council to Aedas in 2010, with the works cost stated in 2011 to be ( in 2012). Realisation of the plans is hoped to &quot;attract new business and jobs&quot;, in the aftermath of the announcement of the Cadbury Somerdale Factory closure.

In January 2012, it was announced that the Willmott Dixon Group had been appointed as contractor on the scheme. The Council&#x27;s planning committee in August 2012 deferred the approval decision, pending alterations to the external appearance of the building. These were approved in October 2012, with demolition commencing in the same month. The regenerated Keynsham Civic Centre came back into use in late 2014 and early 2015.

In the latter half of the 2010s, Keynsham underwent rapid expansion with hundreds of new homes built.

==Governance==

Keynsham Town Council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council&#x27;s role includes projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning.

Playing fields and playgrounds are provided in Memorial Park, Downfield, Kelston Road, Teviot Road, Holmoak Road and Manor Road with basketball facilities at Teviot Road and Holmoak Road and a BMX track at Keynsham Road. The Keynsham town council is also responsible for the football pitches and pavilion at Manor Road and the floodlit Multi Sport Site in Memorial Park. It also provides support for community groups organising music and cultural events. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

The town council was formed in 1991 and consists of 15 members elected every four years. The town council is divided into three wards. As of May 2023, Keynsham East is represented by five Liberal Democrat councillors, Keynsham North has four Liberal Democrat councillors and one Green Party councillor and Keynsham South is represented by three Labour and two Liberal Democrat councillors. Keynsham has one official twin town: Libourne in France.

Formerly an urban district within the county of Somerset, between 1974 and 1996 the town became part of the larger district of Wandsdyke within the short-lived county of Avon. The town is now represented as part of the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, in the ceremonial county of Somerset. Bath and North East Somerset Council was established in 1996 under the Local Government Act 1992. The town is divided into three wards on the unitary authority, Keynsham East which has two Liberal Democrat Councillors, Keynsham North, which has two Liberal Democrat councillors, Keynsham South which is represented by one Conservative and one Labour councillor.

Bath and North East Somerset provides a single tier of local government, with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area, including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

Bath and North East Somerset&#x27;s area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath, but many departments are headquartered in Keynsham. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the main town of the Wansdyke district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 the parish was part of the Keynsham Urban District.

The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North East Somerset and Hanham constituency following the 2023 boundary changes by the Boundary Commission for England replacing the North East Somerset Parliamentary Seat. In the first election following these changes in the 2024 general election the constituency elected Dan Norris of the Labour Party, who had previously represented the Wansdyke constituency that preceded North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Geography==

Keynsham is located where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing rights for the Millground and Chewton sections of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to chub, roach, European perch and rudd, along with good numbers of gudgeon, dace and trout. Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew.

Memorial Park, the northern part of which has existed as parkland since the 19th century, as shown by the ordnance Survey maps of 1864 and 1867, was formally laid out after World War II was extended after the floods of 1968. It covers of woodland and grass alongside the River Chew. It commemorates the war dead of Keynsham and includes facilities including two children&#x27;s play areas, a skateboard park, multi-sport area, bowling green, public toilets, a bandstand and refreshment kiosk. The formal gardens within the park are adjacent to the River Chew with the Dapps Hill Woods at its western end. Part of the park is known locally as Chew Park because of its proximity to the river and another area, close to Keynsham Abbey as Abbey Park. The park received the Green Flag Award in 2008/09, and again for 2009/10.
On the outskirts of Keynsham lies Keynsham Humpy Tumps, one of the most floristically rich acidic grassland sites within the Avon area. The site is on a south-facing slope running alongside the Bristol to Bath railway line. It consists of open patches of grassland and bare rock, interspersed with blocks of scrub. It is the only site in Avon at which upright chickweed &quot;Moenchia erecta&quot;, occurs. Other locally notable plant species found here include annual knawel &quot;Scleranthus annuus&quot;, sand spurrey &quot;Spergularia rubra&quot;, subterranean clover &quot;Trifolium subterraneus&quot; and prickly sedge &quot;Carex muricata&quot; ssp. &quot;lamprocarpa&quot;. The site does not have any statutory conservation status, and is not managed for its biodiversity interest. Threats to its ecological value include the encroachment of scrub onto the grassland areas, and damage from motorcycle scrambling. Between Keynsham and Saltford, a area of green belt has been planted, with over 19,000 trees, as the Manor Road Community Woodland, which has been designated as a Nature Reserve. Nearby is the Avon Valley Country Park tourist attraction.

Along with the rest of South West England, Keynsham has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 °C (50 °F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 °C (34 °F) and 2 °C (36 °F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21 °C (70 °F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.

Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800–900 mm (31–35 in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.

==Demography==

In the 2001 census Keynsham had a population of 15,533, in 6,545 households, of which 6,480 described themselves as White. Keynsham East Ward had a population of 5,479, Keynsham North 5,035 and Keynsham South 5,019. In each of the wards between 75 and 80% of the population described themselves as Christians, and around 15% said that they had no religion.

In 1881 the population of the civil parish was 2,482. This grew gradually until 1931 when there were 4,521, before there was a steeper rise to 1951 when there were 8,277. Over the next ten years this nearly doubled to 15,152 in 1961.

==Economy==

An important industry in the town was Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate factory, the Somerdale Factory. The J. S. Fry &amp; Sons business merged with Cadbury in 1919, and moved their factory in the centre of Bristol to Keynsham in 1935. As Quakers, Cadbury&#x27;s built the factory on a greenfield site with social facilities, including playing fields and recreational sports grounds. Called Somerdale after a national competition in 1923, Keynsham Cadbury was the home of Fry&#x27;s Chocolate Cream, the Double Decker, Dairy Milk and Mini Eggs, Cadbury&#x27;s Fudge, Chomp and Crunchie.

On 3 October 2007, Cadbury announced plans to close the Somerdale plant by 2010 with the loss of some 500 jobs. Production was to be moved to factories in Birmingham and Poland, and in the longer term it was expected that the site would be redeveloped for housing. Labour MP for Wansdyke, Dan Norris, said &quot;news of the factory&#x27;s closure is a hard and heavy blow, not just to the workforce, but to the Keynsham community as a whole&quot;. By late 2007 campaigns to save the Cadbury&#x27;s factory in Somerdale were in full swing, and one local resident started a campaign to urge English Heritage to protect the site and preserve the history of the factory.

In 2009 the US corporation Kraft made a takeover bid for Cadbury. Cadbury&#x27;s were seen as iconic of British manufacturing industry, and the bid became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; of national interest. To sweeten their case before the Monopolies Commission, Kraft made a pledge to keep the Cadbury factory at Somerdale open if they were successful in their bid for the company; and their bid was duly successful. However, within a week of completing their purchase of Cadbury, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld released a statement announcing that Kraft were to close the factory by 2011, as originally planned by Cadbury. The stated reason for this was that it was only after the purchase had been made that Kraft realised how advanced Cadbury&#x27;s plans were, but industry experts questioned this, arguing that Kraft invested so much in researching their bid for Cadbury that they should have been aware of the extent to which plans had been advanced.

==Culture==
In 1969 the town was featured as the title of the fourth album &quot;Keynsham&quot; by the Bonzo Dog Band. The title was chosen in honour of Horace Batchelor, who had been referenced in previous Bonzo Dog Band recordings. In the early 1960s, Batchelor became known through his regular advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for his football pools prediction service. When giving his contact address, he would slowly spell out &#x27;Keynsham&#x27; letter by letter, and this became an amusing feature for many young listeners.

Keynsham Festival, which started in the late 1990s, takes place in the Memorial Park each July, and attracts around 16,000 people. There is also a Victorian evening held in the town each November. This has since been renamed Keynsham Winter Festival. Keynsham and Saltford local history society was formed in 1965 and is concerned with researching and recording the history of the area.

Keynsham was chosen as the outdoor location for a dramatic story-line in the BBC One TV serial EastEnders in September 2012 with filming taking place in a cordoned-off section of the High Street.

In Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen, Catherine and her friends ride to ″within view of the town of Keynsham″.

==Media==
Local television news programmes are covered by &quot;BBC Points West&quot; and &quot;ITV News West Country&quot; which both broadcast from Bristol.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Bristol on 94.9 FM, Heart West on 96.3 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Bristol &amp; The South West on 107.2 FM, Hits Radio Bristol on 106.5 FM, Kiss on 97.2 FM and KTCRfm, which is an Ofcom licensed community station which broadcast from the town on 105.8 FM, DAB and also online.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Bristol Post&quot; (formerly &quot;Bristol Observer&quot;).

==Transport==

The town is served by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes. It opened in 1840 and was renamed Keynsham and Somerdale in 1925. The chocolate factory had its own rail system which was connected to the main line, but the connection was taken out of use 26–27 July 1980. The station&#x27;s name reverted to Keynsham on 6 May 1974. The station was rebuilt in 1985 as a joint project between British Rail and Avon County Council.

The A4 trunk road used to run through the town, but much of this traffic is now carried on the bypass, which was constructed in 1964. The bypass runs from Saltford, a village which adjoins Keynsham, to Brislington in Bristol. Keynsham is about 10 miles (16 km) from junction 1 of the M32 via the Avon Ring Road A4174 and provides a fast route to the M4 and M5.

Keynsham is on the Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath which approximates the escape route taken by King Charles II in 1651 after being defeated in the Battle of Worcester.

In May 2017, the High Street was made one-way for traffic heading towards Saltford and Bath with all Bristol-bound diverted along Ashton Way. There is now no access to Temple Street from High Street with the exception of buses and taxis, all traffic for Temple Street is diverted along Ashton Way.

The town is served by 6 bus routes, 1 of which connects Bath with Bristol International Airport, another bus service runs from Ashton Way at the back of the shops to Southmead Hospital and one bus service runs to Cribbs Causeway. In numerical order:
* A4 Bath to Bristol Airport
* 17 Keynsham to Southmead Hospital
* 18 Bath to Cribbs Causeway
* 39 Bath to Bristol
* 178 Radstock to Bristol
* 349 Keynsham to Bristol

All buses towards Bristol, Southmead and Cribbs Causeway use the bus stop on Ashton Way at the back of the shops, whilst all buses towards Bath use the stop on the High Street opposite the Post Office.

==Education==
State-funded schools are organised within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset. A review of Secondary Education in Bath was started in 2007, primarily to reduce surplus provision and reduce the number of single-sex secondary schools in Bath, and to access capital funds available through the government&#x27;s Building Schools for the Future programme. There are five primary schools in Keynsham, St John&#x27;s Primary School, Castle Primary School, Chandag Primary School (formerly separate Infant and Junior schools until 2023), St Keyna Primary School (formed when Keynsham Primary School and 150 year old Temple Primary School merged in 2007) and Two Rivers CofE Primary School which opened in 2019. There are also three secondary schools: Wellsway; Broadlands; and IKB Academy.
Wellsway School is an 11–18, mixed comprehensive school which was established in 1971, by amalgamating Keynsham Grammar School and Wellsway County Secondary School both of which opened on a shared site in the mid-1950s. Most students that attend the school live in Keynsham and Saltford or the nearby villages. As of 2014, approximately 1335 students attend the school, ranging in age of 11–18, with 64% achieving 5 or more A-C grades at GCSE. Wellsway&#x27;s bid for specialist school status was accepted in September 2007. In 2013 it became an academy and was the founder school of Wellsway Multi Academy Trust which later rebranded itself as Futura Learning Partner in September 2021.

Broadlands Academy became an academy in 2012. It has 430 students between the ages of 11 and 16 years.

IKB Academy opened in September 2015, and has a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM) subjects. It is a studio school for pupils aged 14–19, and offers GCSEs, A Levels, and BTECs, in conjunction with weekly or fortnightly work placements.

Nearby Bath has two universities. The University of Bath was established in 1966. It is known, academically, for the physical sciences, mathematics, architecture, management and technology. Bath Spa University was first granted degree-awarding powers in 1992 as a university college (Bath Spa University College), before being granted university status in August 2005. It has schools in Art and Design, Education, English and Creative Studies, Historical and Cultural Studies, Music and the Performing Arts, and Social Sciences. The city contains one further education college, City of Bath College, and several sixth forms as part of both state, private, and public schools. In England, on average in 2006, 45.8% of pupils gained 5 grades A-C including English and Maths; for Bath and North East Somerset pupils taking GCSE at 16 it is 52.0%. Special needs education is provided by Three Ways School.

==Religious sites==

Begun in 1292, the Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist, Keynsham gradually evolved until taking its present general form during the reign of Charles I, after the tower collapsed into the building during a storm in 1632. The tower, built over the north-east corner of the nave, now rises in three stages over the Western entrance and is surmounted by a pierced parapet and short crocketted pinnacles and is said to have been built from the ruins of the abbey church. The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of the abbey, was rebuilt in 1470 and further restoration was carried out in 1634–1655, following the collapse of the tower. There is a pulpit dating from 1634 and is also a screen of the same age which shuts off the choir vestry. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.

A former organ is said to have stood in the church, but &quot;had tones so mellow&quot; that Handel bargained for it, offering a peal of bells in exchange. The offer was accepted. The musician went off with the organ and the bells were delivered. There are eight bells in total, some made by the Bilbie family of Chew Stoke, the smallest bears these lines:

&quot;I value not who doth me see
For Thomas Bilbie casted me;
Althow my sound it is but small
I can be heard amongst you all.&quot;
St John the Baptist church is one of five churches in the Church of England Parish of Keynsham, the others being the village churches of St Michael&#x27;s in Burnett and St Margaret&#x27;s in Queen Charlton, the &quot;Mission Church&quot; in Chewton Keynsham (formerly the school building), and St Francis&#x27; Church on the Park Estate which in 2013 - 2015 underwent extensive modernisation and offers two halls for use by community groups.

There are also the Victoria and Queens Road Methodist churches, St Dunstan&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church and an Elim Church. The churches work together, also with churches in Saltford, under the banner of &quot;Churches Together in Keynsham and Saltford&quot; and often with the strapline &quot;More to Life&quot;.

Keynsham Rugby Football Club play at Crown Field. The club&#x27;s most notable and tragic event occurred on 24 December 1992, when there was a fatal road accident outside the club&#x27;s ground. A Ford Fiesta car ploughed into 11 people leaving the annual festive disco. One woman, 21-year-old Sarah Monnelle, died at the scene. A second person, 24-year-old rugby player Richard Barnett, died in hospital two days later from his injuries.

Keynsham Hockey Club play at Wellsway School. The club currently runs 3 ladies’, 2 men&#x27;s and 1 mixed team, plus 5 youth teams at various age groups for children aged 7 and upwards. The club was formerly known as Fry&#x27;s Hockey Club and had existed for nearly 100 years. Fry&#x27;s Hockey Club was based at Fry Club on the Somervale site for Fry&#x27;s, then Cadbury&#x27;s before it closed in 2012. Hockey was played at the site from the 1920s when the Fry&#x27;s chocolate factory reputedly had more than 15 ladies teams. By the 1970s the club had shrunk to only two ladies&#x27; teams whose games were played only as friendlies on a Saturday using a grass pitch. Since then, the club has grown to its present structure.

Keynsham Town F.C. were founded in 1895. They have played continuously apart from a break during World War II and moved to their current ground, the Crown Field, in 1945. They first played in the Bristol &amp; District League and progressed through the Bristol Combination, Bristol Premier and Somerset Senior League and won the Somerset Senior Cup in 1951–52 and 1957–58.

<text>The Malabar lark, or Malabar crested lark (Galerida malabarica) is a species of lark in the family Alaudidae found in western India.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Originally, the Malabar lark was classified in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot; before being moved to its present genus. Also, some authorities have considered the Thekla lark to be a subspecies of the Malabar lark.

==Description==
This is a smallish lark, slightly smaller than the Eurasian skylark. It has a long spiky erectile crest. It is greyer than the skylark, and lacks the white wing and tail edges of that species, which is a winter visitor to India.

It is very similar to the crested lark, which breeds in northern India. The Malabar lark is smaller and dark-streaked reddish brown in plumage, whereas the crested lark is grey. The belly is white. The sexes are similar.

Sykes&#x27;s lark is another Indian relative that also has reddish-brown plumage, but is smaller, shorter-billed, with a stiff upright crest and has plain rufous underparts.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Malabar lark is found in western India. It is a common bird of open country, cultivation and scrub, often at some altitude.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Malabar lark is a sedentary breeding bird that nests on the ground, laying two or three eggs. Its food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.

<doc id="403051" wikidata="Q7379480" url="?curid=403051" title="Run (2002 film)">
<text>Run is a 2002 Indian Tamil-language romantic action film directed by N. Linguswamy and produced by A. M. Rathnam under Sri Surya Movies. It stars Madhavan and Meera Jasmine (in her Tamil debut), alongside Vivek, Atul Kulkarni, Raghuvaran and Anu Hasan. The music was composed by Vidyasagar, while the cinematography and editing were handled by Jeeva and V. T. Vijayan. 

&quot;Run&quot; was released on 5 September 2002 to positive reviews from critics, which prompted the film to be partially reshot in Telugu with Sunil playing Vivek&#x27;s role. It was remade in Hindi under the same name by Jeeva, with Abhishek Bachchan and Bhumika Chawla reprising the roles of Madhavan and Meera Jasmine.

==Plot==
Shiva lives in Srirangam, arrives at Chennai to gain admission to a college, and stays with his sister and her husband. He does not like his brother-in-law and never talks to him despite several attempts made by his sister to convince them. Shiva meets Priya during a bus journey. He meets her on a few more occasions and proposes to her. However, Priya warns him to stop following her despite being in love with him.

Shiva learns that Priya&#x27;s brother, Bhaskar, is a local gangster who attacks when anyone follows Priya. She does not want Shiva to get beaten by Bhaskar and advises him to stop following her. Bhaskar&#x27;s henchmen spot Shiva and Priya together and try to attack him. Shiva thrashes them, ultimately encouraging Priya to go against Bhaskar. Shiva&#x27;s brother-in-law learns about his love and offers help which makes them talk to each other, much to the happiness of Shiva&#x27;s sister.

Bhaskar arrives to attack Shiva&#x27;s family, but Shiva threatens to attack Bhaskar&#x27;s family, thereby frightening him. Priya elopes with Shiva and Bhaskar chases after them along with his men. The couple is tracked down and the goons start attacking Shiva. Priya interferes and challenges Bhaskar to attack Shiva single-handedly without any help from his men. Bhaskar accepts and starts attacking Shiva, but Shiva retaliates and hits back at Bhaskar, who gets severely injured. He finally lets Shiva and Priya unite.

==Cast==
==Production==
Ajith Kumar was initially considered to play the lead role. Madhavan signed the film in January 2002 after being impressed with Lingusamy&#x27;s narration and through the project would make his first appearance in an action-orientated role. Madhavan wanted to do an action film after being instructed by Mani Ratnam to move away from romantic drama films and lost eight kilograms to portray the lead role. Vidya Balan was originally selected to play the lead role in the film, but was later released from her contract.

The makers then signed on Raima Sen to portray the lead role before deciding to change the lead actress again after the actress struggled with the Tamil dialogues. Meera Jasmine was consequently signed on to make her first appearance in Tamil films before finalising Sangeetha. Atul Kulkarni was signed to play an antagonist, marking a rare move for the actor towards regular antagonistic roles. Raghuvaran, Anu Hasan, and Vivek were also signed on to work on the film with Vivek filming a separate comedy track.

The scenes were shot at locations in Chennai, Karaikudi, and Srirangam, among other places, while the songs were shot abroad in Denmark and Switzerland. The team also filmed scenes at the M.G. R. Film City in Chennai, where action sequences were filmed. The film completed production in one schedule, with Madhavan remarking about the well-organised structure of the shoot.

==Soundtrack==

The music was composed by Vidyasagar, with lyrics written by Na. Muthukumar, Pa. Vijay, Thamarai, Yugabharathi, Arivumathi, and Viveka. The soundtrack won critical acclaim and became Vidyasagar&#x27;s most successful album at the time of its release.
==Release==
The release was postponed from July 2002 to September 2002 to finish off post-production works. However, the box-office bomb of Rajinikanth-starrer &quot;Baba&quot; (2002) meant that the makers were able to prepone the film to the earliest release date in September to avoid other competition. The makers of the film chose to release the film on Thursday instead of Friday, in order to avoid a box office clash with &quot;King&quot; (2002). The film was later dubbed and released in Telugu under the same name during April 2003 with the comedy portions re-shot with Telugu actors. The Telugu version was released on the same day as &quot;Dil&quot; (2003) since that film had a similar storyline.

== Reception ==
&quot;Run&quot; received positive reviews from critics.

=== Critical response ===
Malathi Rangarajan of &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote &quot;The track Lingusamy has chosen could be an age-old one, but the agility and youthfulness make the run interesting&quot;. Malini Mannath of &quot;Chennai Online&quot; wrote &quot;It is to the director’s credit that he has kept the narration fast paced and engaging with not many lagging moments&quot;. &quot;Nowrunning&quot; wrote &quot;Director Linguswamy has given a very enjoyable film with good music by Vidyasagar and brilliant cinematography by Jeeva. Madhavan has proved in this film that he can also do action and that too convincingly&quot;. &quot;Cinema Today&quot; wrote &quot;There is nothing new about the film&#x27;s story, but Madhavan&#x27;s new incarnation as an action hero and Linguswamy&#x27;s racy screenplay has made this a thoroughly enjoyable experience&quot;. R Shiva Srivatsav of &quot;Angelfire&quot; wrote &quot;The other hero in this film apart from our cute hero Madhavan is the screenplay of the movie&quot;.

=== Box office ===
&quot;Run&quot; went on to become amongst the highest-grossing Tamil films of the year in 2002 and became Madhavan&#x27;s most profitable film at the time of release. Vivek also won the Best Comedian Award at the Filmfare Awards 2002.

==Legacy==
The film was later remade the film in Hindi by Jeeva with Abhishek Bachchan, Bhumika Chawla and Vijay Raaz and into Bengali Bangladesh in 2004 as &quot;Rukhe Darao&quot; with Shakib Khan and Sahara.

A film titled &quot;Kadhal Pisase&quot;, named after the song from the film, was released in 2012. A popular scene involving Madhavan closing a subway shutter was later parodied in the spoof film &quot;Thamizh Padam&quot; (2010), while it was also referred to in &quot;Vettai&quot; (2012), in which the actor and director had collaborated again.

<text>The Democratic National Rally (; , RND) is a political party in Algeria. The party held its Second Congress on 15–17 May 2003.

==History==
The RND was founded on 21 February 1997 in the midst of the Algerian Civil War for supporters of Liamine Zéroual, former head of ground forces of the Algerian military who had been elected president less than two years earlier (16 November 1995). Zéroual had run as an independent and won 60% of votes cast. In the Algerian Parliamentary elections held on 5 June 1997 the RND received more votes than any other party 156 out of 380 seats. In the next parliamentary elections five years later it came in third polling only 9.5% of the vote, winning 47 of 380 seats in the Algerian Parliament. In the 2007 election it obtained 10.33% of the vote and 61 seats out of the 389 seats. It is part of the presidential alliance, a three party political alliance created in 2005, the other two parties being the former sole legal party, the National Liberation Front, and the Movement for the Society of Peace.

The Georgetown University Berkley Center describes the RND as having &quot;replaced&quot; the FLN as the Algerian &quot;state party&quot; temporarily for the 1995 and 1997 elections &quot;after the FLN was defeated by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the 1991-1992 national legislative elections&quot;. That election was canceled by a military coup and the civil war that followed killed as many 200,000 Algerians, but once the Islamist insurgents were pacified to a large degree, the &quot;FLN regained its place as the majority and ruling party&quot;.

RND Secretary-General Ahmed Ouyahia was appointed as prime minister on 23 June 2008.

<text>The Morrow Project is a science fiction role-playing game created by Kevin Dockery, Robert Sadler and Richard Tucholka and published by Timeline Ltd. It is set after a devastating nuclear war. It was first released in the 1980s, and it still has a loyal following. The fourth edition was released as of December 15, 2013 by Chris Morrell and Robert O&#x27;Connor.

== History ==
In 1974, Robert Sadler wrote an outline for a post-apocalyptic adventure story. Richard Tucholka added a second chapter, but then the project was buried for a year or more. In 1975, they were introduced to roleplaying, and Tucholka suddenly realized that &quot;The Morrow Project&quot; could be an adventure background for a roleplaying game. He used Sadler&#x27;s story as a guide to write that game background. Then the two joined forces with Kevin Dockery to flesh out the military portion of the game.

After months of playtesting, it was run at an early Michicon and was a great success there. At that point, Timeline Games was born and shortly thereafter, due to internal conflicts, both Richard Tucholka and Robert Sadler left Timeline Games and created Tacky-Tac Games, which later became Tri Tac Games.

In late 2012, after several years of development, a Kickstarter campaign was run to provide the funds to finish the 4th edition of &quot;The Morrow Project&quot;. The Kickstarter campaign easily exceeded its goal and finished successfully on January 3, 2013. The new edition was released on December 15, 2013.

== Setting ==
The game is based around the idea that a group of American industrialists predicted the coming of an apocalyptic nuclear war, and began to create a plan for an emergency operations and reconstruction infrastructure that would survive that war. This plan is the eponymous &quot;Morrow Project&quot;. A number of volunteers were cryonically frozen in hidden bunkers called boltholes. They were provided with substantial caches of supplies and equipment, intended to help the teams rebuild civilization -- once the war had ended, it was thought some places would be identified where the hazards such as nuclear fallout had diminished sufficiently.

The plan was for the Morrow Project to be coordinated by a central command post and record-keeping facility called &quot;Prime Base.&quot; This is an immense self-contained bunker with various annexes, hidden underground in Nevada, in the canyons near Soldier Meadow. Its details are explained in the game book entitled &quot;Prime Base.&quot; The facility&#x27;s advanced life support systems and huge variety of other equipment were intended to allow the Project&#x27;s leaders not to sleep through the war, so as to chronicle it and be in the best position to determine out what should be done next. The Project&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix Team,&quot; a highly secret Tier-I special operations unit of approximately platoon strength, was also here, but kept in suspended animation to be used only on the highest authority if there was no alternative.

Prime Base was built in isolation according to schedule, but just before it could assume its role it was sabotaged and bombed by a shadowy madman called Krell, sustaining serious damage. The sudden attack wiped out the Morrow Project leaders, but 150 years after the war, the damaged central computer at Prime Base finally began to issue one or more wakeup signals. This revived at least one of the Morrow Project assets -- the team that the player characters are part of. The status of other Teams is purposefully kept unclear, so that details can be worked out by the person coordinating the game, who is called the Project Director.

The game therefore centers around the question of whether the Project is hopelessly compromised, or whether its scattered outposts can reconnect and replace the non-functional headquarters. Must they try to confront huge reconstruction tasks alone, when it was expected that thousands of Project members would help them? Do they have the courage to try?

=== Initial scenario ===
The initial scenario may be played with nothing other than the game book, dice, paper and pencil. Expansion sets are available introducing further scenarios, weapons and equipment.

One hundred and fifty years after the Third World War, the members of the Morrow Project wake to a strange world. Instead of being part of an organized plan to rebuild their civilization, they find themselves isolated in a world where the War is only a distant legend, the people are ignorant of anything but the struggle to survive and strange mutated animals haunt their footsteps.

Players of the Morrow Project must not only survive, but must carry out their original mission: to rebuild the world. To do this they have their equipment and training, their team and their own guts and imagination. Together with their teammates they must try to do alone a job that thousands were trained to do.

Included in the game book there are extensive details on the Morrow Project&#x27;s teams, vehicles, weapons, other equipment, medical details, the various dangers arising from nuclear weapons effects, and also information to help the Project Director decide which people and creatures exist in the post-holocaust world -- in particular various animals affected in either more or less scientifically accurate ways. Up until Fourth Edition, there was also detailed information on which locations in the United States had been struck by Soviet ICBMs, which of the enemy MIRVs had failed to detonate, and which had struck targets other than those intended.

=== MARS, recon, science and specialty ===
While each team is equipped to survive on its own, it proved impossible to equip all the teams for every postwar contingency. For example, some Recon Teams are almost as heavily armed as MARS Teams, while others are not.

With teams having been put to sleep over a course of several years from the 1960s onwards, there will also be variations in the equipment they have. In some cases, teams may wake to find new equipment they are not yet trained on, and will have to teach themselves from instructional materials.

Below is a general summary of the Project groups:

* Recon: The general purpose teams of the Project and the most numerous, Recon teams are equipped with varying types of weapons and equipment ranging from V-150 armored cars to SK-5 hovercraft. Their orders are to reconnoiter the countryside, report on local conditions, and provide advice to Prime Base concerning which teams should be awakened next.
* MARS: These teams make up the military arm of the Project -- they are extremely formidable and heavily armed. In addition to conventional weapons, some of these teams have man-portable laser weapons, and some have an early generation of no-nonsense, minimalist powered armor. The purpose of the MARS teams is to support and defend civilians and other teams. A large portion of MARS team members are ex-military personnel with combat experience. MARS stands for Mobile Assault, Rescue and Strike. Some MARS teams have heavy vehicles such as the Mars One. The Mars One is a large custom-built articulated vehicle with very heavy armor and powerful weapons. It is able to carry troops, employ onboard sensors, provide early warning, and serve as a command post.
* Science: The Science teams are broadly cross-trained scientific and technical units that can cope with a wide range of situations -- from complex medical care and epidemiology to understanding unusual hazards and dangerous creatures. Their areas of knowledge range from biology to nuclear physics. They are equipped with a second type of versatile custom-built articulated vehicle, called the Science One, and have armament second only to that of the MARS teams.
* Specialty: This is a broad term applied to Project groups that have a non-standard function in regard to their equipment and personnel. Specialty groups generally consist of assets frozen with orders to meet at a predesignated point. Most Specialty teams are not as heavily armed as Recon or MARS teams, because the Project&#x27;s planners felt that those teams could not fully perform the necessary functions if survivors felt threatened by them. Specialty groups assigned to the Project include:

:Engineering: Building, construction, repair and maintenance of Project and civilian equipment.
:Agricultural: Farming and livestock preserved by using frozen embryos. Equipped to build and assist farming communities.
:Psychological: Formed to handle extremist groups, riots, negotiation challenges, and other serious problems caused by stress.
:Aviation: Air survey reconnaissance, fire support, and air mobility support for other teams. These missions are done with fixed-wing aircraft including cargo planes, as well as light helicopters, early types of unmanned aerial vehicles, and custom-built autogyros that are modular and man-portable.
:Command: Oversight of Combined Group assets, both mobile field teams and fixed installations, generally for a city or limited geographical area such as. Combined Group Seattle.
:Frozen Watch: Casualty replacement personnel for the field teams, as well as Morrow Project field police, internal security, and counterintelligence functions.
:Power Reception: Reception of electrical power which is scheduled to be transmitted via microwaves, once Morrow Project power satellites have been lofted.
:Support: Logistical support such as supply, repair, and replacement operations.
:Communications: Restore radio frequency, laser microwave, and eventually even satellite communications. They also maintain the project&#x27;s clandestine extremely low frequency systems that very slowly accumulate Prime Base&#x27;s messages, such as briefings, for teams to read when they awaken—thus counterbalancing the minuscule data rate. For security reasons, ELF systems were not for use until after the war.
:Medical: Health care for the general population and for project assets. Generally equipped with a fixed installation.
:Decontamination: Render safe personnel, vehicles and structures contaminated by radiological, biological, or chemical hazards. Also assist in the salvage of equipment and materials recovered from unsafe areas.

===Supplements===
* &quot;Game Master&#x27;s Package: Basic Vehicular Loads&quot; was a supplement detailing basic equipment loads, with three copies of each, for 11 different &quot;Morrow Project&quot; vehicles. It was published by Timeline Ltd. in 1980 as 39 xeroxed sheets, stapled in groups. A second edition was published in 1980, as 39 loose-leaf hole-punched sheets with a large envelope. William A. Barton reviewed &quot;Vehicular Basic Loads&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 48. Barton commented that &quot;If you&#x27;re a &quot;Morrow Project&quot; GM, you should find these &quot;Vehicular Base Loads&quot; sheets of use in your campaigns.&quot;

==Reception==
In the May 1981 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 39), William A. Barton commented that &quot;overall, I&#x27;d have to give &quot;The Morrow Project&quot; the highest of ratings as a SF role-playing system. If it isn&#x27;t at least nominated for the Origins awards this year, there just ain&#x27;t no justice in gameland.&quot;.

In the June 1981 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #50), Bill Fawcett thought the combat realism of the rules made it &quot;suitable, with very few changes, for a role-playing game of World War III infantry and armored combat.&quot; He did note the resultant complexity of the rules, saying, &quot;The price of this realism is the great amount of dice-rolling necessary to determine the location and effect of wounds.&quot; Fawcett was not as impressed with the rest of the rules. &quot;There is nothing too distinctive about the game system as a whole.&quot; He suggested that two types of gamers would be interested in this game: &quot;those who are interested in modern weapons and combat, and those who play the &quot;Gamma World&quot; game, who will find the ideas in this game readily adaptable to that system.&quot;

Chris Baylis reviewed &quot;The Morrow Project&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;My first impressions of the &quot;Morrow Project&quot; made me want to begin a game immediately. The idea seemed new and exciting, and the system looked advanced, well thought out and imaginative.&quot;

Phil Masters reviewed &quot;The Morrow Project&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #42, giving it an overall rating of 5 out of 10, and stated that &quot;&quot;The Morrow Project&quot; is a game with a very specific style, a lot of strengths. and a lot of weaknesses. Like any post-holocaust game, it may be a little depressing; it is certainly quite violent. It is, by current standards, simple and playable, and could be worse at the price.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called this the most graphic and chilling RPG depiction of near-future nuclear carnage ever published.&quot; Swan was surprised that, given the great amount of detail given to nuclear war and military weapons, &quot;the character creation rules are surprisingly fuzzy.&quot; Swan found that &quot;The game comes alive with the combat rules, the most detailed treatment of violent encounters this side of &quot;Aftermath!&quot;&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 2.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;As a game, &quot;Morrow Project&quot; has too many ambiguous rules for casual players, though hard-core science-fiction fans might enjoy it. But as a sourcebook of nuclear holocaust, it&#x27;s without peer, unreservedly recommended to anyone with an interest in the subject.&quot;

<doc id="403069" wikidata="Q470641" url="?curid=403069" title="Charles, Prince of Viana">
<text>Charles, Prince of Viana () (29 May 1421 – 23 September 1461), sometimes called Charles IV of Navarre, was the eldest son of King John II of Aragon and Queen Blanche I of Navarre. He pre-deceased his father.

==Background==
His mother was the daughter and heiress of Charles III, King of Navarre. Both his grandfather Charles and his mother, who ruled over Navarre from 1425 to 1441, had bequeathed this kingdom to Charles, whose right had also been recognized by the Cortes; but when Blanche died in 1441 her husband John seized the kingdom to the exclusion of his son.

==Marriage==
The Prince of Viana was married in Olite (Navarre) on 30 September 1439, taking as his wife Agnes of Cleves (1422–1446), the daughter of Adolph I, Duke of Cleves and Mary of Burgundy, and the niece of Philip III &quot;the Good&quot;, Duke of Burgundy. Agnes died, childless, on 6 April 1448, eight years after her marriage to Charles, aged only about twenty-six. After her death, the prince took a mistress, Brianda de Vaca, and by her had an illegitimate son, born about 1449. He wished to remarry, and a possibility which was canvassed was a match with Isabella of Scotland (1426–1494), the widow of Francis I, Duke of Brittany, after he died on 18 July 1450, but this was opposed by Charles VII of France. A match was then agreed between Charles and the Infanta Catherine of Portugal (1436–1463), daughter of King Edward of Portugal, but the marriage was delayed and had not taken place when Charles died in 1461.

Charles left three illegitimate children by three different mistresses:
#Anna, Countess of Medinaceli (1451-1477), married Luis de la Cerda y de la Vega, 5th Count of Medinaceli, 
#Philip, Archbishop of Palermo (1456–1488),
#John, Bishop of Huesca (died 1526).

== Clashes with his father ==

The ill feeling between father and son was increased when his father John took in 1447 for his second wife Juana Enriquez, a Castilian noblewoman (of a bastard cadet line from Castilian kings), who soon bore him a son, afterwards Ferdinand II of Aragon, and who regarded her stepson as an interloper. When Joanna began to interfere in the internal affairs of Navarre, a civil war broke out, and in 1452 Charles, although aided by King John II of Castile, was defeated and taken prisoner.&lt;br&gt; 
Released upon promising not to take the kingly title until after his father&#x27;s death, the prince, again unsuccessful in an appeal to arms, took refuge in Naples with King Alfonso V of Aragon. In 1458 Alfonso died and John became king of Aragon, while Charles was offered the crowns of Naples and Sicily. He declined these proposals, and having been reconciled with his father, returned to Navarre in 1459. Aspiring to marry Isabella of Castile, he was then thrown into prison by his father, and the Catalans rose in his favor. This insurrection soon became general and John was obliged to yield. He released his son, and recognized him as perpetual governor of Catalonia, and heir to the kingdom.

== Death and legacy ==

Soon afterwards, however, on 23 September 1461, the prince died at Barcelona, not without a suspicion that he had been poisoned by his stepmother, Joanna Enriquez.

Charles was a cultured and amiable prince, fond of music and literature. He translated Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot; into Aragonese, a work first published at Zaragoza in 1509, and wrote a chronicle of the kings of Navarre, &quot;Cronica de los reyes de Navarra.&quot;

<doc id="403073" wikidata="Q214367" url="?curid=403073" title="Adolfo Suárez">
<text>Adolfo Suárez González, 1st Duke of Suárez (; 25 September 1932 – 23 March 2014) was a Spanish lawyer and politician. Suárez was Spain&#x27;s first democratically elected prime minister since the Second Spanish Republic and a key figure in the country&#x27;s transition to democracy after the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

When Spain was still an autocratic regime, he was appointed prime minister by King Juan Carlos in 1976, hoping that his government could bring about democracy. At the time of his appointment, he was not a well-known figure, making many political forces skeptical of his government. However, he oversaw the end of the Francoist Cortes, and the legalisation of all political parties (including the Communist Party of Spain, a particularly difficult move). He led the Union of the Democratic Centre and won the 1977 general election. In 1981, he resigned and founded the party Democratic and Social Centre (CDS), which was elected to the Cortes numerous times. He retired from politics in 1991 and from public life in 2003, due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Early life==
Adolfo Suárez González was born on 25 September 1932 in Cebreros in the Province of Ávila of Spain, the eldest son of Hipólito Suárez Guerra, a lawyer, and Herminia González Prados. Both of his parents supported the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. At the age of 18, Suárez was president of the Ávila chapter of Catholic Action. He studied law at the University of Salamanca, after which he took a job at the municipal government of Ávila in 1955. He subsequently became a member of Opus Dei, and obtained a doctorate at the Central University of Madrid. He also worked briefly as a porter at Madrid&#x27;s Atocha railway station.

==Political career==
===Early career===
In 1958, Suárez became the personal secretary of Fernando Herrero Tejedor, the newly appointed civil governor of Ávila. When Tejedor was made deputy secretary-general of the &quot;Movimiento Nacional&quot; in 1961, Suárez became his &quot;chef de cabinet&quot;. He gradually rose through the ranks of the &quot;Movimiento&quot;. In 1965, Suárez was appointed programme director of the state broadcaster Radio y Televisión Española (RTVE). In 1967, he was elected to the Francoist Cortes. In 1968, Suárez was promoted to civil governor and provincial head of the &quot;Movimiento&quot; in Segovia. In 1969, he was made director general of RTVE. Under this capacity, he became a close friend to future king Prince Juan Carlos.

In March 1975, Herrero Tejedor became secretary-general of the &quot;Movimiento&quot; while Suárez was appointed deputy secretary-general. Herrero Tejedor was considered a likely candidate for prime minister until his death in a car accident in June. In December, shortly after Francisco Franco&#x27;s death, Suárez was promoted to secretary-general by prime minister Carlos Arias Navarro, and became a member of Arias&#x27;s cabinet. In the same year, he also became a founding member of the Spanish People&#x27;s Union (&quot;Unión del Pueblo Español&quot;, UDPE).

===Premiership===
In July 1976, King Juan Carlos requested the resignation of Arias. The relatively obscure Suárez was chosen as the new Prime Minister of Spain, surprising many observers. At the age of 43, he was Spain&#x27;s youngest prime minister in the 20th century. Due to his Francoist ties, Suárez enjoyed the trust of the political right, while the reformists were dismayed by his appointment. Nevertheless, it was noted that due to his age (he turned 7 years old in the year the civil war ended), Suárez was not as strongly associated with the bloody Civil War or the most brutal years of Franco&#x27;s rule as the older politicians.

Within a year of his appointment, Suárez had rapidly introduced reform measures and taken decisive steps in Spain&#x27;s transition to democracy (&quot;La Transición&quot;). The Political Reform Act, which permitted universal suffrage and established the basis for a new, bicameral parliament, was passed by a huge majority in the Francoist Cortes in November 1976 and overwhelmingly approved by a referendum in December. Suárez managed to placate the conservative military officers, while also reaching out to Felipe González&#x27;s Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) and later, Santiago Carrillo&#x27;s Communist Party of Spain (PCE). Between February and April 1977, the PSOE and the PCE were both legalised, trade unions were recognised, and the &quot;Movimiento&quot; was abolished. The legalisation of the PCE in particular provoked fury in the Spanish military; Suárez responded by sacking hardliners and promoting more liberal officers such as Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado. On 15 June, Suárez led the Union of the Democratic Centre (&quot;Unión de Centro Democrático&quot;, UCD) to victory in Spain&#x27;s first free elections in 41 years, and became the first democratically elected prime minister of the post-Francoist Spain.

In 1978 during Suárez premiership Spain voted in the United Nations General Assembly condemning human rights abuses in Chile, distancing thus Spain from the Francoist-influenced military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. 

Suárez&#x27;s centrist government instituted further democratic reforms. A new constitution, which recognised Spain as a constitutional monarchy, was approved by a referendum in December 1978. In an effort to address separatist tensions and calls for increased local autonomy, Suárez also negotiated the creation of Spain&#x27;s autonomous communities. Suárez&#x27;s coalition won the 1979 elections under the new constitution.

Suárez&#x27;s political power eroded as he struggled to deal with economic recession, mounting violent activity by ETA, calls for further regional autonomy and divisions within his own party. He became increasingly withdrawn from governance, partly due to a chronic dental condition. He survived a motion of no confidence presented by Felipe González and the PSOE in May 1980. In January 1981, trailing in the polls behind the PSOE and faced with a revolt within the UCD, Suárez announced his resignation as prime minister. A month later, as parliament took the vote to confirm Suárez&#x27;s successor Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, Lieutenant-Colonel Antonio Tejero and around 200 Civil Guards stormed the chamber in an attempted coup and held the lawmakers hostage for some 22 hours. Suárez, along with two other parliamentarians, exhibited defiance by remaining calmly seated during the panic. The 23-F coup attempt (&quot;El Tejerazo&quot;) failed as it was opposed by Spain&#x27;s main newspaper El País (who managed to get a special edition in favor of the constitution issued and distributed on the evening of the coup attempt) and denounced by King Juan Carlos I in a televised address. Meanwhile, promised military support for the coup failed to materialise – with few exceptions, most notably Jaime Milans del Bosch who led pro-coup troops in Valencia.

===Post-premiership===

In 1982, Suárez founded the Democratic and Social Centre (Centro Democrático y Social, CDS) party, which never achieved the success of UCD, though Suárez and its party were important elements in the Liberal International, joining it in 1988, leading to it being renamed &quot;Liberal and Progressive International&quot;, and Suárez became President of the Liberal International in 1988. He retired from active politics in 1991, for personal reasons.

In 1981, Suárez was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos of Spain and given the hereditary title of &quot;Duque de Suárez&quot; (Duke of Suárez), together with the title Grande de España (English: Grandee of Spain) following his resignation as Prime Minister and in recognition of his role in the transition to democracy. Suárez was awarded the &quot;Príncipe de Asturias a la Concordia&quot; in September 1996 for his role in Spain&#x27;s early democracy. On 8 June 2007, during the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the first democratic elections, King Juan Carlos appointed Suárez the 1,193rd Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He was also a member of the Club de Madrid, an independent organization (based in Madrid) that is composed of more than 80 former democratic Prime Ministers and Presidents. The group works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership.

==Illness and death==
On 31 May 2005, Suárez&#x27;s son, Adolfo Suárez Illana, announced on Spanish television that his father was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The announcement followed speculation about Suárez&#x27;s health in the Spanish media. On 21 March 2014, his son announced that his death from neurological deterioration was imminent. Suárez then died as a result of a respiratory infection on 23 March 2014 in a clinic in Madrid. Suarez was given a state funeral and was buried in the cloister of Ávila Cathedral.

Pope Francis shared his condolences, saying: &quot;In fraternal suffrage with you all, I make fervent prayers to the Lord for the eternal rest of this esteemed and feature figure of the recent history of Spain.&quot;

On 26 March 2014, the Spanish government decided to rename the Madrid-Barajas Airport to Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport in honour of his service to the country.

==Family==

Suárez married María del Amparo Illana Elórtegui in 1961. She died from cancer on 17 May 2001. Their eldest daughter, María del Amparo (&quot;Mariam&quot;) Suárez Illana (1962–2004), died of breast cancer on 6 March 2004, following an 11-year illness. Both of her younger sisters also suffered from the same illness. She was the mother of two children, Alejandra Romero Suárez (born 1990), herself the current holder of her grandfather&#x27;s dukedom, and Fernando Romero Suárez (born 1993).

Suarez&#x27; youngest daughter, María Sonsoles Suárez Illana (born 1967), became a TV news anchor for Antena 3. From 1992 to 1994 she was married to José María Martínez-Bordiú y Bassó de Roviralta (a nephew of Cristóbal Martínez-Bordiú, the son-in-law of Francisco Franco); the couple was without issue. In 2012 she married the Mozambican musician Paulo Wilson, and they separated in 2017.

Suárez&#x27;s eldest son, Adolfo Suárez Illana, is a politician, lawyer, and is heavily involved with the world of bullfighting and has two sons. Suárez had two more children, his daughter Laura and his son Francisco Javier; both remain unmarried.

<text>This article lists political parties in Tunisia.
Tunisia was a dominant-party state of the Constitutional Democratic Rally (&quot;RCD&quot; from its French language initials) before the Tunisian revolution. In the aftermath of the revolution the RCD was dissolved by the new state authorities and over 70 new political parties formed. The country is now a multiparty state. Although there are two numerically major parties, no single party has a realistic chance of governing alone.

<text>Jaime Meline (born March 2, 1975), better known by the stage name El-P (shortened from his previous stage name El Producto), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Starting his career as a member of Company Flow, he has been a driving force in alternative hip hop since the mid-1990s, producing for rappers including Aesop Rock, Cage, and Mr. Lif. He was a member of The Weathermen and was the co-founder, owner, and CEO of the Definitive Jux record label.

After releasing four solo studio albums that were critically acclaimed&quot;Fantastic Damage&quot; (2002), &quot;High Water&quot; (2004), &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (2007), and &quot;Cancer 4 Cure&quot; (2012)El-P began experiencing mainstream success in 2013 when he formed the hip hop superduo Run the Jewels with fellow rapper Killer Mike. They have released four studio albums for free, all of which have received widespread acclaim: &quot;Run the Jewels&quot; (2013), &quot;Run the Jewels 2&quot; (2014), &quot;Run the Jewels 3&quot; (2016), and &quot;RTJ4&quot; (2020).

==Early life==
El-P was born Jaime Meline in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on March 2, 1975, the son of Nan Dillon and jazz pianist Harry Meline (who performed under the stage name Harry Keyes). He is of Cajun, Irish, and Lithuanian descent. Although his mother was raised Catholic and his father was raised Jewish, they did not emphasize either faith to him during his childhood and he later joked that he &quot;got none of it except a circumcision at birth&quot;.

El-P&#x27;s parents divorced when he was seven years old, and he later wrote the song &quot;Last Good Sleep&quot; about once hearing his mother being assaulted by his drunken stepfather in the next room and not realizing what had happened until the next day. His mother responded to the beating by immediately ending the relationship, reporting El-P&#x27;s stepfather to the police, and changing their home&#x27;s locks; however, El-P had recurring nightmares about the incident for many years, and once chased a stranger who he believed was his ex-stepfather through the New York subway.

El-P was expelled from two high schools for various issues, including his refusal to stop wearing his baseball cap backwards. He later got his GED. He went to musical engineering school at the Center for the Media Arts in Manhattan. After graduating, he enrolled at Hunter College, but dropped out because most of his courses did not relate to the career he wanted.

==Career==
===Early career===
Getting involved with the hip hop culture of New York City at an early age, El-P met Mr. Len when he hired Len as the DJ for his 17th birthday party. The two became friends and formed Company Flow in 1992. They released their first single, &quot;Juvenile Technique&quot;, in 1993. Bigg Jus joined the group and in 1995 the trio released their debut EP, &quot;Funcrusher&quot;. It sold well for an independently released record, with more than 30,000 copies sold despite only being available on vinyl. Subject to a major-label bidding war after the success of the EP, Company Flow waited until it could get a contract on its own terms. The group eventually signed with Rawkus Records, and released its debut full-length album, &quot;Funcrusher Plus&quot; (1997).

After an instrumental album titled &quot;Little Johnny From the Hospitul: Breaks &amp; Instrumentals Vol.1&quot; (1999), also on Rawkus, disagreements between El-P and the label led to Company Flow leaving Rawkus. El-P decided to start his own record label, Definitive Jux (known informally as Def Jux, and extra-formally as Definitive Juxtapositions), and because of critically acclaimed albums such as Cannibal Ox&#x27;s &quot;The Cold Vein&quot; (produced by El-P) and Aesop Rock&#x27;s &quot;Labor Days&quot;, the label rose to prominence.

Company Flow dissolved amicably in 2001 and the following year El-P released his debut solo album &quot;Fantastic Damage&quot;, to critical acclaim. In 2004, El-P collaborated with the Blue Series Continuum for a jazz-fusion album titled &quot;High Water&quot;, which received favorable reviews from both hip hop and jazz critics, as well as from more mainstream critics independent of both scenes. 2005 saw the release of &quot;Collecting the Kid&quot;, an odds-and-ends assortment including work from &quot;High Water&quot; and &quot;Bomb the System&quot;, in addition to several songs of unknown provenance. El-P&#x27;s second proper studio album, &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, was released on March 20, 2007. It generally received very favorable reviews and became El-P&#x27;s most commercially successful album as a solo artist to date, peaking at No. 78 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In an interview about &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, he identifies himself as an atheist.

In October 2009, El-P announced that he was working on his third studio album, titled &quot;Cancer 4 Cure&quot;. El-P was a part of a group called Central Services, which consisted of El-P, Camu Tao, and Allysin Baker. In the fall of 2010, the EP &quot;Forever Frozen in Television Time&quot;, was released exclusively on the Def Jux digital download service. In August 2011, it was announced that El-P signed with Fat Possum Records, which would release &quot;Cancer 4 Cure&quot;. Later that month, El-P released a single off the upcoming album, via the Adult Swim Singles program, titled &quot;Drones Over BKLYN&quot;. On February 22, 2012, El-P announced on his Facebook page that &quot;Cancer 4 Cure&quot; was complete. The album was released to music retailers on May 22.

===Run the Jewels===
Run the Jewels, a collaboration of El-P with Atlanta-based rapper Killer Mike, was formed in 2013. The two rappers were introduced to each other by Adult Swim executive Jason DeMarco in 2011. The meeting led to several collaborations, including Killer Mike being featured on the song &quot;Tougher Colder Killer&quot; from &quot;Cancer 4 Cure&quot; while El-P produced the entirety of Killer Mike&#x27;s sixth album &quot;R.A.P. Music&quot;. When &quot;R.A.P. Music&quot; and &quot;Cancer 4 Cure&quot; were released within weeks of each other, a joint tour was planned. The success of the tour eventually led to the formation of Run the Jewels. The duo released their self-titled debut album on June 26, 2013. They released &quot;Run the Jewels 2&quot; on October 28, 2014. &quot;Run the Jewels 3&quot; was released on December 24, 2016, three weeks prior to the previously announced release date of January 13, 2017. A fourth album, &quot;RTJ4&quot; was released on June 3, 2020. All of their albums to date have been released for free.

===Production and featured appearances===
El-P has contributed productions and guest rhymes to albums by Aesop Rock, Evil Nine, DJ Krush, Murs, Cage, Mr. Lif, Prefuse 73, Del tha Funkee Homosapien, Mike Ladd, The High and Mighty, Jedi Mind Tricks, Aceyalone, Atmosphere, Techno Animal, and Das Racist. He collaborated with Alec Empire on the first Handsome Boy Modeling School album and with Cage and Chino Moreno on the second. He was selected, along with DJ Shadow and Trent Reznor, to work on Rage Against the Machine frontman Zack de la Rocha&#x27;s solo album (which never materialized). He produced The Veils album Total Depravity, with the song Axolotl later appearing in David Lynch&#x27;s new series of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. He has provided remixes for the likes of Beans (of Anti-Pop Consortium), Beck, Blackalicious, Head Automatica, Hot Hot Heat, Dizzee Rascal, Syd Matters, Nine Inch Nails, Push Button Objects, Rob Sonic, TV on the Radio, Lorde, and Yasushilde, among others. El-P provided the soundtrack for the graffiti film &quot;Bomb the System&quot;.

===Film scoring===
El-P was the principal composer for the 2005 film &quot;Bomb the System.&quot; His track &quot;Another Body&quot; was made for Josh Trank&#x27;s 2015 superhero film &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and featured in the film&#x27;s end credits. He called the track &quot;an homage to one of my biggest influences Philip Glass&quot;. El-P was one of the candidates to score a trailer for 2017&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, but his score was &quot;rejected or ignored&quot;. He later worked again with Trank and created the score for the 2020 biopic &quot;Capone&quot;.

==Style==
El-P&#x27;s rapping style is characterized by dense, aggressive, and verbose attacks that include heavy use of metaphors, sci-fi fantasy themes, pop culture references, and associative wordplay. His lyrics often feature themes found in the works of sci-fi author Philip K. Dick, such as paranoia and questions about the nature of reality. Reviewing his 2002 album &quot;Fantastic Damage&quot;, critic Steve Huey described El-P as &quot;one of the most technically gifted MCs of his time, spitting out near-impossible phrases and rhythmic variations that simply leave the listener&#x27;s head spinning&quot;.

El-P&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;High Water&quot; was a radical departure, pitting his beats and production against a jazz band under the direction of pianist Matthew Shipp, a fan of El-P&#x27;s music. In a 2003 interview with Shipp for &quot;Bomb&quot; magazine, El-P stated, &quot;First and foremost, I wanted to [make a different album] because it scared the shit out of me. And when I get offered the chance to be involved with something that scares me, I usually do it, because I&#x27;m trying to learn, I&#x27;m trying to understand music as much as I can, to become a better musician in general and work in different capacities.&quot;

==Personal life==
El-P began dating comedian and musician Emily Panic in 2010, and they married in October 2018. Panic was featured on Killer Mike&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;R.A.P. Music&quot;, which El-P produced.

<text>Scipio Nasica was the name of several members of the Scipiones, a branch of the patrician Roman gens Cornelia. Metellus Scipio was born into this family, but was later adopted out to the gens Caecilia. He still retained his former name by combining it with that of his adoptive father.

<doc id="403085" wikidata="Q182515" url="?curid=403085" title="Treaty of Sèvres">
<text>The Treaty of Sèvres () was a 1920 treaty signed between some of the Allies of World War I and the Ottoman Empire, but not ratified. The treaty would have required the cession of large parts of Ottoman territory to France, the United Kingdom, Greece and Italy, as well as creating large occupation zones within the Ottoman Empire. It was one of a series of treaties that the Central Powers signed with the Allied Powers after their defeat in World War I. Hostilities had already ended with the Armistice of Mudros.

The treaty was signed on 10 August 1920 in an exhibition room at the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres porcelain factory in Sèvres, France.

The Treaty of Sèvres marked the beginning of the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The treaty&#x27;s stipulations included the renunciation of most territory not inhabited by Turkish people and their cession to the Allied administration.

The ceding of Eastern Mediterranean lands saw the introduction of novel polities, including the British Mandate for Palestine and the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon.

The terms stirred hostility and Turkish nationalism. The treaty&#x27;s signatories were stripped of their citizenship by the Grand National Assembly, led by Mustafa Kemal Pasha, which ignited the Turkish War of Independence. Hostilities with Britain over the neutral zone of the Straits were narrowly avoided in the Chanak Crisis of September 1922, when the Armistice of Mudanya was concluded on 11 October, leading the former Allies of World War I to return to the negotiating table with the Turks in November 1922. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres, ended the conflict and saw the establishment of the Republic of Turkey.

== Negotiations ==
=== Allied powers ===
=== Ottoman Empire ===
The representatives of the Allied Powers submitted the draft peace treaty they had prepared at the San Remo Conference (18-26 April 1920) and requested a response from the Ottoman government within a month. Former Grand Vizier Tevfik Pasha sent the draft agreement, which he found “incompatible with the concepts of independence and even statehood”, to the government. The Ottoman government formed a commission to edit the proposal, and sent back their recommendations to the Allies Powers on 25 June 1920. The Allied Powers sternly rebuked Istanbul that they could expect to make any changes to the draft they previously prepared, other than a few minor, unimportant changes, and requested a response within ten days. Press in the capital was partial to the Sublime Porte with many concluding that there was no other choice but to accept the treaty.

Before making the final decision on the treaty, the sultan Mehmed VI convened another Sultanate Council on 22 July 1922 (the first one was called in May 1919 after the Greek landing at Smyrna), so that responsibility for treaty could be shifted to them. Government members, members of the Senate, former grand viziers, high-ranking officers, and leading figures of the ulema and bureaucracy were invited to the council. The number of delegates was 57 (down from 131 of the previous council), and didn&#x27;t include politicians affiliated with the Turkish National Movement. Care was taken not to invite representatives of the Defense of Rights movement and those with a Unionist political identity and background.

The council began deliberations by discussing a July 17 telegram from the Minister of the Interior Reşit Bey, who was in Paris, stating that the Allied Powers did not accept Ottoman reservations on the draft treaty. On July 20 the council announced that there was no other option but to approve the treaty. Grand Vizier Damat Ferit Pasha gave a speech, stating that the country had come to this point due to ten years of terrible mistakes instigated by the Committee of Union and Progress, but that Istanbul was still entrusted to the Turks because of the trust the Allies had in the Sultan, and that there was no other solution than accepting the treaty. Other statesmen like Mustafa Sabri Efendi and Hâdî Pasha gave speeches in support of the treaty. A vote was held in which all delegates supported the signature of the treaty, except for Topçu Feriki Rıza Pasha, who abstained.

== Summary ==
==Parties==

George Dixon Grahame signed for the United Kingdom, Alexandre Millerand for France, and Count Lelio Longare for Italy. One Allied power, Greece, did not accept the borders as drawn, mainly because of the political change after the 1920 Greek legislative election, and so never ratified the treaty. 

There were three signatories for the Ottoman Empire:

# Ex-Ambassador Hadi Pasha,
# Ex-Minister of Education Rıza Tevfik Bölükbaşı,
# Second secretary of the Ottoman embassy in Bern, Reşat Halis.

Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha was present at the negotiations, but not a signatory to the treaty.

The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was not a party to the treaty because it had negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Ottoman Empire in 1918.

The Treaty of Versailles was signed with the German Empire before the Treaty of Sèvres and annulled German concessions in the Ottoman sphere, including economic rights and enterprises.

Also, France, Britain, and Italy signed a Tripartite Agreement on the same date. It confirmed Britain&#x27;s oil and commercial concessions and turned the former German enterprises in the Ottoman Empire over to a tripartite corporation.

The United States, having refused in the Senate to assume a League of Nations mandate over Armenia, decided not to participate in the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The US wanted a permanent peace as quickly as possible, with financial compensation for its military expenditure. However, after the Senate rejected the Armenian mandate, the only US hope was its inclusion in the treaty by the influential Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos.

== Provisions ==
The treaty imposed a number of territorial losses on Turkey and had a number of provisions that applied to the territory recognised as belonging to Turkey.

=== Non-territorial ===
==== Financial restrictions ====
The Allies were to control the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s finances, such as approving and supervising the national budget, implementing financial laws and regulations and totally controlling the Ottoman Bank. The Ottoman Public Debt Administration, instituted in 1881, was redesigned to include only British, French, and Italian bondholders. The Ottoman debt problem had dated back to the time of the Crimean War (1854–1856) during which the Ottoman Empire had borrowed money from abroad, mainly from France. Also the capitulations of the Ottoman Empire, which had been abolished in 1914 by Talaat Pasha, were restored.

The empire was required to grant freedom of transit to people, goods, vessels etc. passing through its territory, and goods in transit were to be free of all customs duties. Future changes to the tax system, the customs system, internal and external loans, import and export duties and concessions would need the consent of the financial commission of the Allied Powers to be implemented. To forestall the economic repenetration of Germany, Austria, Hungary or Bulgaria, the treaty demanded the empire to liquidate the property of citizens of those countries living within its territories. The public liquidation was to be organized by the Reparations Commission. Property rights of the Baghdad Railway were to pass from German control.

==== Military restrictions====
The Ottoman Army was to be restricted to 50,700 men, and the Ottoman Navy could maintain only seven sloops and six torpedo boats. The Ottoman Empire was prohibited from creating an air force. The treaty included an interallied commission of control and organisation to supervise the execution of the military clauses.

==== International trials ====
The treaty required determination of those responsible for the Armenian genocide. Article 230 of the Treaty of Sèvres required the Ottoman Empire to &quot;hand over to the Allied Powers the persons whose surrender may be required by the latter as being responsible for the massacres committed during the continuance of the state of war on territory which formed part of the Ottoman Empire on August 1, 1914&quot;. However, the inter-allied tribunal attempt to prosecute war criminals as demanded by the Treaty of Sèvres was eventually suspended, and the men who orchestrated the genocide escaped prosecution and traveled relatively freely throughout Europe and Central Asia.

==== Communal relations ====
The Ottoman Empire was to ensure equal rights between Muslims and non-Muslims, return deportees to their homes, and restore property which was previously confiscated. All conversions to Islam since 1 November 1914 were to be annulled.

===Foreign zones of influence ===
==== France ====
Within the territory retained by Turkey under the treaty, France received Syria and neighbouring parts of southeastern Anatolia, including Antep, Urfa and Mardin. Cilicia, including Adana, Diyarbakır and large portions of east-central Anatolia all the way north to Sivas and Tokat, were declared a zone of French influence on Sykes–Picot Agreement.

==== Greece ====
The Greek government administered the occupation of Smyrna from 21 May 1919. A protectorate was established on 30 July 1922. The treaty transferred &quot;the exercise of her rights of sovereignty to a local parliament&quot; but left the region within the Ottoman Empire. The treaty had Smyrna to be administered by a local parliament, with a plebiscite overseen by the League of Nations after five years to decide if Smyrna&#x27;s citizens wished to join Greece or to remain in the Ottoman Empire. The treaty accepted Greek administration of the Smyrna enclave, but the area remained under Turkish sovereignty. To protect the Christian population from attacks by the Turkish irregulars, the Greek army expanded its jurisdiction also to nearby cities creating the so-called &quot;Smyrna Zone&quot;.

==== Italy ====
Italy was formally given possession of the Dodecanese Islands, which had been under Italian occupation since the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 despite the Treaty of Ouchy according to which Italy should have returned the islands to the Ottoman Empire. Large portions of southern and west-central Anatolia, including the port city of Antalya and the historic Seljuk capital of Konya, were declared to be an Italian zone of influence on Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. Antalya Province had been promised by the Triple Entente to Italy in the Treaty of London, and the Italian colonial authorities wished the zone to become an Italian colony under the name of Lycia.

=== Territorial provisions ===

==== Zone of the Straits ====
A Zone of the Straits was proposed to include the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmara. Navigation would be open in the Dardanelles in times of peace and war alike to all vessels of commerce and war, regardless of flag. That would effectively lead to the internationalisation of the waters, which were not to be subject to blockade, and no act of war could be committed there except to enforce decisions of the League of Nations.

==== Free zones ====
Certain ports were to be declared to be of international importance. The League of Nations insisted on the complete freedom and the absolute equality in treatment at such ports, particularly regarding charges and facilities, to ensure that economic provisions in commercially-strategic places were carried out. The regions were to be called &quot;free zones&quot;. The ports were Constantinople from San Stefano to Dolmabahçe, Haidar-Pasha, Smyrna, Alexandretta, Haifa, Basra, Trabzon and Batum.

==== Thrace ====
Eastern Thrace (up to the Chatalja line), the islands of Imbros and Tenedos and the islands of the Sea of Marmara were ceded to Greece. The waters surrounding the islands were declared international territory and left to the administration of the &quot;Zone of the Straits&quot;.

==== Kurdistan ====

The Kurdistan region, including Mosul Province, was scheduled to have a referendum to decide its fate.

There was no general agreement among Kurds on what the borders of Kurdistan should be because of the disparity between the areas of Kurdish settlement and the political and administrative boundaries of the region. The outlines of Kurdistan as an entity had been proposed in 1919 by Şerif Pasha, who represented the Society for the Elevation of Kurdistan (&quot;Kürdistan Teali Cemiyeti&quot;) at the Paris Peace Conference. He defined the region&#x27;s boundaries as follows:

The frontiers of Turkish Kurdistan, from an ethnographical point of view, begin in the north at Ziven, on the Caucasian frontier, and continue westwards to Erzurum, Erzincan, Kemah, Arapgir, Besni and Divick (Divrik?); in the south they follow the line from Harran, Sinjar Mountains, Tel Asfar, Erbil, Süleymaniye, Akk-el-man, Sinne; in the east, Ravandiz, Başkale, Vezirkale, that is to say the frontier of Persia as far as Mount Ararat.

That caused controversy among other Kurdish nationalists, as it excluded the Van Region (possibly as a sop to Armenian claims to that region). Emin Ali Bedir Khan proposed an alternative map that included Van and an outlet to the sea via what is now Turkey&#x27;s Hatay Province. Amid a joint declaration by Kurdish and Armenian delegations, Kurdish claims concerning Erzurum vilayet and Sassoun (Sason) were dropped, but arguments for sovereignty over Ağrı and Muş remained.

Neither proposal was endorsed by the treaty of Sèvres, which outlined a truncated Kurdistan on what is now Turkish territory (leaving out the Kurds of Iran, British-controlled Iraq and French-controlled Syria). The current Iraqi–Turkish border was agreed upon in July 1926.

Article 63 explicitly granted the full safeguard and protection to the Assyro-Chaldean minority, but that provision was dropped in the Treaty of Lausanne.

==== Armenia ====

Armenia was recognised as a &quot;free and independent&quot; state in Section VI &quot;Armenia&quot;, Articles 88-93. By Article 89, &quot;Turkey and Armenia, as well as the other High Contracting Parties agree to submit to the arbitration of the President of the United States of America the question of the frontier to be fixed between Turkey and Armenia in the vilayets of Erzerum, Trebizond, Van and Bitlis, and to accept his decision thereupon, as well as any stipulations he may prescribe as to access for Armenia to the sea, and as to the demilitarisation of any portion of Turkish territory adjacent to the said frontier&quot;.

The treaty specified that the frontiers between Armenia and Azerbaijan and Georgia were to be determined by direct negotiation between those states, with the Principle Allied Powers making the decision if those states fail to agree.

==== British Mandate for Iraq ====
The details in the treaty regarding the British Mandate for Iraq were completed on 25 April 1920 at the San Remo Conference. The oil concession in the region was given to the British-controlled Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC), which had held concessionary rights to Mosul Province. British and Iraqi negotiators held acrimonious discussions over the new oil concession. The League of Nations voted on the disposition of Mosul, and the Iraqis feared that without British support, Iraq would lose the area. In March 1925, the TPC was renamed the &quot;Iraq Petroleum Company&quot; (IPC) and granted a full and complete concession for 75 years.

==== British Mandate for Palestine ====

The three principles of the British Balfour Declaration regarding Palestine were adopted in the Treaty of Sèvres:

:Article 95: The High Contracting Parties agree to entrust, by application of the provisions of Article 22, the administration of Palestine, within such boundaries as may be determined by the Principal Allied Powers, to a Mandatory to be selected by the said Powers. The Mandatory will be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on 2 November 1917 by the British Government, and adopted by the other Allied Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.

==== French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon ====
The French Mandate was settled at the San Remo Conference: it comprised the region between the basin of the Euphrates River and the Syrian Desert on the east and the Mediterranean Sea on the west, and extended from the Nur Mountains in the north to Egypt in the south. This represented an area of about with a population of about 3,000,000, including Lebanon and an enlarged Syria, both of which were later reassigned under a League of Nations Mandate. The region was divided under the French into five governments as follows: Aleppo, from the Euphrates region to the Mediterranean, which included the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta (modern-day Hatay); Damascus, including Damascus, Hama, Homs and the Hauran; Greater Lebanon, extending from Tripoli to Palestine; the Alawite State, comprising the coast between the Sanjak of Alexandretta and Greater Lebanon, and the Jabal Druze State, around the city of As-Suwayda. Faisal ibn Husayn, who had been proclaimed king of Syria by a Syrian National Congress in Damascus in March 1920, was ejected by the French in July the same year. The next year, he became king of Iraq.

==== Kingdom of Hejaz ====
The Kingdom of Hejaz, on the Arabian Peninsula, was granted international recognition and had an estimated area of and a population of about 750,000. The main cities were the Holy Places of Makka, with a population of 80,000, and Medina, with a population of 40,000. Under the Ottomans, it had been the vilayet of Hejaz, but during the war, it became an independent kingdom under British influence.

==Abandonment==
The Treaty of Sèvres imposed terms on the Ottoman Empire that were far more severe than those imposed on the German Empire by the Treaty of Versailles. France, Italy and Britain had secretly begun planning the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire as early as 1915. The open negotiations covered a period of more than 15 months, started at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, continued at the Conference of London of February 1920 and took definite shape only after the San Remo Conference in April 1920. The delay occurred because the powers could not come to an agreement, which, in turn, hinged on the outcome of the Turkish National Movement. The Treaty of Sèvres was never ratified, and after the Turkish War of Independence, most of the Treaty of Sèvres&#x27;s signatories signed and ratified the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 and 1924.

While the Treaty of Sèvres was still under discussion, the Turkish national movement under Mustafa Kemal Pasha split with the monarchy, based in Istanbul, and set up a Turkish Grand National Assembly in Ankara in April 1920. The so-called Ankara government closely monitored the preparation of the draft treaty and its acceptance by the Istanbul government. On June 7, 1920, the Grand National Assembly passed a law declaring all treaties signed by the Istanbul Government since 16 March 1920 (the formal occupation of Istanbul) invalid.

On 18 October, the government of Damat Ferid Pasha was replaced by a provisional one under Ahmed Tevfik Pasha as Grand Vizier, who announced an intention to convene the Senate to ratify the Treaty of Sèvres if national unity was achieved. That required seeking the co-operation of Mustafa Kemal, who expressed disdain for the treaty and started a military assault. As a result, the Turkish government issued a note to the Entente that the ratification of the treaty was impossible at the time.

Eventually, Mustafa Kemal succeeded in the Turkish War of Independence and forced most of the former wartime Allies to return to the negotiating table at Lausanne.

Aside from Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s armed opposition to the treaty in Anatolia, Arabs in Syria were unwilling to accept French rule, the Turks around Mosul attacked the British, and Arabs were up in arms against British rule in Baghdad. There was also disorder in Egypt.

==Subsequent treaties==
During the Turkish War of Independence, the Turkish Army successfully fought Greek, Armenian and French forces and secured the independence of a territory similar to that of present-day Turkey, as was aimed at by the National Pact.

The Turkish national movement developed its own international relations with the Treaty of Moscow with Soviet Russia on 16 March 1921, the Accord of Ankara with France putting an end to the Franco-Turkish War, the Treaty of Alexandropol with the Armenians and the Treaty of Kars to fix the eastern borders.

Hostilities with Britain over the neutral zone of the Straits were narrowly avoided in the Chanak Crisis of September 1922, when the Armistice of Mudanya was concluded on 11 October, leading the former Allies of World War I to return to the negotiating table with the Turks in November 1922. That culminated in 1923 in the Treaty of Lausanne, which replaced the Treaty of Sèvres and restored a large territory in Anatolia and Thrace to the Turks. Under the Treaty of Lausanne, France and Italy lost their zones of influence to areas of facilitated economic interaction, the Northern Syrian Regions were separated from Ottoman Syria, Constantinople was not made an international city, and a demilitarised zone between Turkey and Bulgaria was established.

<text>The Democratic Constitutional Rally or Democratic Constitutional Assembly ( &#x27;, , sometimes also calledConstitutional Democratic Rallyin English), also referred to by its French initialsRCD, was a political party in Tunisia. It including its predecessors Neo Destour and the Socialist Destourian Party, it was the ruling party of the country from independence in 1956 until it was overthrown and dissolved in the Tunisian revolution in 2011.

==History and profile==
In 1920, Tunisian nationalists formed the Destour (Constitutional) Party in opposition to French rule. As the party developed, a schism occurred within the party, leading to the founding of the Neo Destour Party in 1934 by Habib Bourguiba and several younger members of the old Destour. Under his leadership, the Neo Destour Party successfully garnered independence from France in 1956. As it was, for all intents and purposes, the only well-organized party in the country, it swept the Constituent Assembly elections held later that year. A year later, Tunisia was declared a republic with Bourguiba as first president.

In 1963, the Neo Destour was formally declared the only legally permitted party in Tunisia, though for all intents and purposes, party and state had been one since independence. In 1964, the Neo Destour Party became the Destourian Socialist Party (PSD).

Opposition parties were legalized once again in 1981. From then on, the PSD faced opposition from Hizb ut-Tahrir, the Islamic Tendency Movement, the Tunisian Communist Party, the Movement for Popular Unity and student groups. Although its influence was slightly weakened, the PSD continued to sweep all elections to the legislature.

On 7 November 1987, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who had been named Prime Minister only a month earlier, became president after Bourguiba was declared medically unfit for office. The following year, President Ben Ali instituted economic reforms increasing economic privatization and renamed the party the Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD). Ben Ali did not face an opponent for reelection until 1999, in part because of a longstanding requirement that potential presidential candidates receive the endorsement of 30 political figures. Given the RCD&#x27;s near-absolute dominance of the political scene, prospective opposition candidates discovered they could not get their nomination papers signed. Even after the provision was repealed in 1999, Ben Ali was reelected by implausibly high margins. While opposition parties finally managed to enter the legislature for the first time in 1994, they never won more than 24 percent of the seats, and there was little meaningful opposition to presidential decisions. For all intents and purposes, the RCD continued to rule Tunisia as a one-party state.

In the 2009 general election, the last held before the revolution, the RCD won 161 of 214 seats with the remaining 53 seats going to minority parties. Ben Ali was elected to a fifth full term with 89.6 percent of the vote, the only time he claimed to win by less than 90 percent of the vote. These elections, like virtually all others in the country since independence, were widely seen as fraudulent. The outcry over the elections proved to be a major cause of the revolution which forced Ben Ali to resign and flee into exile.

In response to the RCD&#x27;s attempt to suppress the protests, the Socialist International expelled the RCD on 17 January 2011—three days after Ben Ali fled the country. In order to placate protesters and designated coalition participants, the incumbent president and prime minister resigned from their memberships in the RCD on 18 January and all remaining RCD-aligned ministers resigned their party memberships on 20 January, the effect of which left the RCD with only a parliamentary majority. On 27 January, Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi carried out a major reshuffle, removing all former RCD members other than himself from the government.

The interior ministry suspended the party&#x27;s operations on 6 February, a little less than a month after Ben Ali fled into exile. On 9 March, the party was dissolved by the Tunisian courts.

<text>José Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo (born 23 January 1946) is a Nicaraguan politician who served as the 56th president of Nicaragua from 10 January 1997 to 10 January 2002. In 2003, he was convicted of corruption and sentenced to a 20-year prison term; the conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of Nicaragua in 2009.

==Early life==
Alemán was born in Managua and received his early education at the La Salle institute in Managua. His father was a prominent lawyer who was an associate of the 1970s Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle and served as Somoza&#x27;s minister of education for a period, and the family owned a large coffee plantation south of Managua.

In 1967 he graduated with a law degree from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Nicaragua-León with specializations in regional economic integration and financial law. Between 1968 and 1979, he worked as a lawyer in the commercial and banking world. He became an official in the government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. In 1980 he was arrested by the Sandinista junta, had some of his property seized and spent nine months in prison. The period of his arrest coincided with the death of his father. This kept him from attending his father&#x27;s funeral. After he was released from prison, he spent some time in the United States.

Upon his return to Nicaragua, Alemán became heavily involved in business, political, and academic activities. He was a member of the Consejo Superior de la Empresa Privada (COSEP, 1988–1990), vice-president of the Unión de Productores Agropecuarios de Nicaragua (UPANIC, 1986–1990). He was president of the Asociación de Cafetaleros de Managua (1983–1990); the Unión de Cafetaleros de Nicaragua (UNCAFENIC, 1986–1990); the Federación de Municipios de América Central (1992–1993) and of the Federación Municipal de Ciudades de Centroamérica (1993–1995). He also took part in conferences at Tulane University and at Florida International University in the United States.

==Political career==
In the early 1990s he became mayor of Managua after serving for two months as a councillor in Managua. He was popular due to his urban renewal projects which helped spruce up the city, severely damaged and never rebuilt after a 1972 earthquake. He became known as &quot;El Gordo&quot; (&quot;The Fat Man&quot;).

Alemán became president of the Liberal Alliance and helped to resurrect it. Besides the PLC, other members of this alliance were the Partidos Neoliberal (PALI), Liberal Independiente de Unidad Nacional (PLIUN) and the Liberal Nacionalista (PLN). On 1 September 1995 he resigned as mayor in order to be able, under Nicaraguan law, to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential election.

In 1996 he campaigned for president as the Liberal Alliance&#x27;s candidate under a strong anti-Sandinista platform. It is reported that unidentified individuals attempted to shoot Alemán, killing one of his bodyguards in the process. He defeated Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista leader, by 48% of the vote to Ortega&#x27;s 40%. Many claimed widespread election fraud and Ortega refused to concede.

Alemán was successful in promoting economic recovery with reduced inflation and growth of GDP. Foreign investment grew during his administration, which helped to improve Nicaragua&#x27;s infrastructure. Under his slogan of &quot;Obras, no palabras!&quot; (&quot;Actions, not words&quot;), Alemán directed a comprehensive reconstruction of the roadway system throughout Nicaragua. In the 1980s roads had deteriorated to the point that many were little more than sparsely paved dirt trails. Alemán also created a program to build schools throughout Nicaragua in some of the poorest regions.

He has participated in international conferences and awards given to him include the Orden Nacional al Mérito of the Colombian government and the Orden de Isabel la Católica of the Spanish government.

His first wife, Maria Dolores Cardenal Vargas died of cancer in 1989. Alemán has two sons and two daughters by his first wife. On 23 October 1999, ten years after the death of his first wife, he married Maria Fernanda Flores Lanzas, with whom he has two daughters and a son.

== Electoral history ==

=== Elections for mayor of Managua 1990 ===

Managua mayor elected by acclamation of the Managua City Council 26 April 1990.

Alemán, a lawyer by profession, was one of the 20 councilors of the National Opposition Union (UNO), elected for a term of six years in general elections and municipals of 25 February 1990. Of these 20 councilors, 16 belonged to the UNO, and the other 4 the Sandinista National Liberation Front. Subsequently, at its first session, the city council chose from among its members Alemán the mayor of Managua, and engineer Roberto Cedeño Borgen as vice mayor.

=== Presidential election results, 6 November 2011 ===

==Corruption charges and conviction==

Alemán, constitutionally barred from another term, was succeeded by his vice president, Enrique Bolaños. Allegations emerged that Alemán had concealed massive corruption in his administration. At the end of his presidency, public information about alleged corruption committed under his government became available.

Bolaños accused Alemán of widespread corruption in the Alemán administration. The scheme was reported to have involved several members of Arnoldo Alemán&#x27;s closest family, including a brother and sister. Ex–ministers and close friends were also charged, some of whom fled the country. However, one of the central figures in the corruption plot, the former chief of the Department of Taxes Byron Jeréz, was imprisoned &quot;on the basis of another charge of corruption. All in all, fourteen persons were charged.&quot; Several foreign governments froze Alemán&#x27;s bank accounts in their countries and threatened to confiscate the funds. In such cases, his defense has been to claim that the funds were not stolen, but that they came from his coffee plantations.

Alemán was formally charged in December 2002, and on 7 December 2003 he was sentenced to a 20-year prison term for a string of crimes including money laundering, embezzlement and corruption. During his trial, prosecutors produced evidence showing that he and his wife had made extremely large charges to government credit cards, &quot;including a $13,755 bill for the Ritz Carlton hotel in Bali and $68,506 for hotel expenses and handicrafts in India.&quot; In addition prosecutors allege that on top of the $30,878 he spent at the Taj Mahal Hotel in India during a vacation, in Cairo in 1999, he charged $22,530 at a carpet shop, and in August that year, charged $3,867 at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, Florida, for his engagement party. He also used $25,955 for a honeymoon trip to Italy after his wedding. All of these expenses, along with others, have contributed to the growing concerns about the political corruption scandals in Nicaragua, a nation where the average citizen earns about $430 a year. Because of health problems, he had been serving his prison term under house arrest. He was also barred from entering the United States. In 2004, Transparency International named him the ninth most corrupt leader in recent history, estimating that he had looted the country of $100 million in state funds to Panamanian bank accounts controlled by him and his family and then funneled some of the money to his party&#x27;s candidates affiliates.

Meanwhile, following his presidency, Alemán developed a strategic alliance with Daniel Ortega to rule without effective opposition by offering employment in public offices and other privileges to key members of the Sandinista party, in order to stabilize the country. There are those who claim that the main purpose of this agreement, which led to a constitutional reform, was to distribute the institutions of the state in proportion to the power managed by the two main political parties of the country.

On 16 January 2009, Nicaraguan Supreme Court justices and Chief Justice Manuel Martinez overturned the 20-year corruption sentence against former President Arnoldo Alemán. The decision generated some controversy: &quot;stunned opposition lawmakers immediately suspected a secret deal between Mr. Alemán, ranked one of the world&#x27;s 10 most corrupt leaders ever by Transparency International, and Daniel Ortega, President of Nicaragua and leader of the Sandinista Party, who wields considerable influence and control over the courts. &quot;He&#x27;s handing over the National Assembly in exchange for his personal liberty&quot;, said Congressman Enrique Saenz. Mr. Alemán, who denies the allegation, said, &quot;Justice has finally been served&quot;.&quot;

The following president, Enrique Bolaños, who served under Aleman as his vice president, succeeded him in January, pledging to clean up the corruption in the nation&#x27;s government, which put him at odds with his predecessor and his administration.

On 9 November 2020, the United States Department of State put Alemán on a list of corrupt foreign officials and also barred his family from entering the country.

<doc id="403097" wikidata="Q1791612" url="?curid=403097" title="Culture of Argentina">
<text>The culture of Argentina is as varied as the country geography and is composed of a mix of ethnic groups. Modern Argentine culture has been influenced largely by the Spanish colonial period and the 19th/20th century European immigration (mainly Italian and Spanish), and also by Amerindian culture, particularly in the fields of music and art. Buenos Aires, its cultural capital, is largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of Southern European descent, and of European styles in architecture. Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all of the large urban centers, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering live music of a variety of music genres.

An Argentine writer reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows:
==Language==
The spoken languages of Argentina number at least 40, although Spanish is dominant. Others include native and other immigrant languages; some languages are extinct and others are endangered, spoken by elderly people whose descendants do not speak the languages.

The most prevalent dialect is &quot;Rioplatense&quot;, also known as &quot;Argentine Spanish&quot;, whose speakers are located primarily in the basin of the Río de la Plata. Argentines are amongst the few Spanish-speaking countries (like Uruguay, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras) that almost universally use what is known as – the use of the pronoun instead of (Spanish for &quot;you&quot;).

In many of the central and north-eastern areas of the country, the &quot;rolling r&quot; takes on a similar sound as the one both ll and y take in the more general Rioplatense dialect (&#x27;zh&#x27; – a voiced palatal fricative sound, similar to the &quot;s&quot; in the English pronunciation of the word &quot;vision&quot;).

The Southern Quechua language is spoken by 0.4% of the population, mostly Bolivian immigrants who have arrived in recent years. There are 70,000 estimated speakers in Salta Province. The language is also known as Central Bolivian Quechua, which has six dialects. It is classified as a Quechua II language, and is referred to as Quechua IIC by linguists.

The Guaraní language is also spoken, mainly near the border with Paraguay, and is an co-official language in the province of Corrientes.

The Welsh language is the co-official language of the province of Chubut. This province was strongly influenced by Welsh migration and is home to the largest community outside the British Isles. The language is spoken in the Patagonian Welsh dialect.

The Afrikaans language, unlike the previous one, does not have co-official status in Chubut, that language arrived with the Boer migration between 1902 and 1908. The language is spoken in the Patagonian Afrikaans dialect.

The German language does not have co-official status but is spoken mainly by the descendants of the Germans, this being the 4th largest ancestry, it is spoken mainly in the provinces of Entre Ríos, Santa Fe, Córdoba, La Pampa, Buenos Aires, Río Negro and Misiones.

Other prominent languages without co-official status in Argentina are Polish, Ukrainian, Galician, Basque, Russian, Armenian, Yiddish, French, Ladino, English, Mapuche, among others.

==Literature==
Argentina has a detailed literary history, as well as one of the region&#x27;s most active publishing industries. Argentine writers have figured prominently in Latin American literature, since becoming a fully united entity in the 1850s, with a strong constitution and a defined nation-building plan. The struggle between the Federalists (who favored a loose confederation of provinces based on rural conservatism) and the Unitarians (pro-liberalism and advocates of a strong central government that would encourage European immigration), set the tone for Argentine literature of the time.

The ideological divide between gaucho epic &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; by José Hernández, and &quot;Facundo&quot; by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, is a great example. Hernández, a federalist, was opposed to the centralizing, modernizing, and Europeanizing tendencies. Sarmiento wrote in support of immigration as the only way to save Argentina from becoming subject to the rule of a small number of dictatorial &quot;caudillo&quot; families, arguing such immigrants would make Argentina more modern and open to Western European influences, and therefore a more prosperous society.

Argentine literature of that period was fiercely nationalist. It was followed by the modernist movement, which emerged in France in the late 19th century, and this period in turn was followed by vanguardism, with Ricardo Güiraldes as an important reference. Jorge Luis Borges, its most acclaimed writer, found new ways of looking at the modern world in metaphor and philosophical debate, and his influence has extended to writers all over the globe. Borges is most famous for his works in short stories such as &quot;Ficciones&quot; and &quot;The Aleph&quot;.

Some of the nation&#x27;s notable writers, poets, and intellectuals include: Juan Bautista Alberdi, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Arlt, Enrique Banchs, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Silvina Bullrich, Eugenio Cambaceres, Julio Cortázar, Esteban Echeverría, Leopoldo Lugones, Eduardo Mallea, Ezequiel Martínez Estrada, Tomás Eloy Martínez, Victoria Ocampo, Manuel Puig, Ernesto Sabato, Osvaldo Soriano, Alfonsina Storni, María Elena Walsh and Oliverio Girondo.

== Visual arts ==
===Painting and sculpture===


Argentine painters and sculptors have a rich history, dating from both before and since the development of modern Argentina in the second half of the 19th century. Artistic production did not truly come into its own, until after the 1852 overthrow of the repressive regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Immigrants like Eduardo Schiaffino, Eduardo Sívori, Reinaldo Giudici, Emilio Caraffa, and Ernesto de la Cárcova left behind a realist heritage influential to this day.

Impressionism did not make itself evident among Argentine artists until after 1900, however, and never acquired the kind of following it did in Europe, though it did inspire influential Argentine Post-Impressionists such as Martín Malharro, Ramón Silva, Cleto Ciocchini, Fernando Fader, Pío Collivadino, Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós, Realism, and aestheticism continued to set the agenda in Argentine painting and sculpture, noteworthy during this era for the sudden fame of sculptor Lola Mora, a student of Auguste Rodin.

As Lola Mora had been until she fell out of favor with local high society, monumental sculptors became in very high demand after 1900, particularly by municipal governments and wealthy families, who competed with each other in boasting the most evocative mausolea for their dearly departed. Though most preferred French and Italian sculptors, work by locals Erminio Blotta, Ángel María de Rosa, and Rogelio Yrurtia resulted in a proliferation of soulful monuments and memorials made them immortal. Not as realist as the work of some of his &quot;belle-époque&quot; predecessors in sculpture, Yrurtia&#x27;s subtle impressionism inspired Argentine students like Antonio Pujía, whose internationally prized female torsos always surprise admirers with their whimsical and surreal touches, while Pablo Curatella Manes&#x27; sculptures drew from cubism.
Becoming an intellectual, as well as artistic circle, painters like Antonio Berni, Lino Enea Spilimbergo, and Juan Carlos Castagnino were friends as well as colleagues, going on to collaborate on masterpieces like the ceiling at the &quot;Galerias Pacifico&quot; arcade in Buenos Aires, towards 1933.

As in Mexico and elsewhere, muralism became increasingly popular among Argentine artists. Among the first to use his drab surroundings as a canvas was Benito Quinquela Martín, whose vaguely cubist pastel-colored walls painted in his Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Boca during the 1920s and 1930s, have become historical monuments and Argentine cultural emblems, worldwide. Lithographs, likewise, found a following in Argentina sometime after they had been made popular elsewhere. In Argentina, artists like Adolfo Bellocq, used this medium to portray often harsh working conditions in Argentina&#x27;s growing industrial sector, during the 1920s and 1930s. Antonio Seguí, another lithographer, transferred his naïve style into murals in numerous nations, as did Ricardo Carpani, though in a realist style.

The vanguard in culturally conservative Argentina, futurists and cubists like Xul Solar and Emilio Pettoruti earned a following as considerable as that of less abstract and more sentimental portrait and landscape painters, like Raúl Soldi. Likewise, traditional abstract artists such as Romulo Macció, Anselmo Piccoli, Eduardo Mac Entyre, Luis Felipe Noé, and Luis Seoane co-existed with equal appeal as the most conceptual mobile art creators such as the unpredictable Pérez Celis, Gyula Kosice of the Argentine , and Marta Minujín, one of Andy Warhol&#x27;s most esteemed fellow Conceptual artists.

The emergence of avant-garde genres in Argentine sculpture also featured Pablo Curatella Manes and Roberto Aizenberg, and constructivists such as Nicolás García Uriburu and Leon Ferrari, one of the world&#x27;s foremost artists in his genre, today. In the 1960s and 1970s, many of these figures&#x27; abstract art found their way into popular advertising and even corporate logos.

Generally possessing a strong sentimental streak, the Argentine public&#x27;s taste for naïve art and simple pottery cannot be overlooked. Since Prilidiano Pueyrredón&#x27;s day, artists in the naïve vein like Cándido López have captured the absurdity of war; Susana Aguirre, and Aniko Szabó, the idiosyncrasies of everyday neighborhoods; Guillermo Roux&#x27;s watercolors, a circus atmosphere; and Gato Frías, childhood memories. Illustrator Florencio Molina Campos&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek depictions of gaucho life have endured as collectors&#x27; items.

To help showcase Argentine and Latin American art and sculpture, local developer and art collector Eduardo Constantini set aside a significant portion of his personal collection, and in 1998, began construction on Buenos Aires&#x27; first major institution specializing in works by Latin American artists. His foundation opened the Buenos Aires Museum of Latin American Art (MALBA) in 2001.

=== Graphic arts ===

In the 1920s, Buenos Aires was overflowing with creative drawings and design. Argentine illustrators and sketchers were attracting worldwide recognition, including artists such as Jose Freire Segundo, creator of gráfica of Aikal (1940); Jose Luis Salinas, called upon by King Features to create a comic strip of worldwide fame, &quot;Cisco Kid&quot;; and Florencio Molina Campos, the brilliant sketcher of the Alpargatas Almanacs of rural life (1930), who collaborated on three Walt Disney films.

The culmination was the arrival, in 1927, of French painter, poster artist and sculptor Lucien Achille Mauzan, who was part of the artistic Art Deco movement. He settled in Buenos Aires and founded his own company &quot;Editorial Affiches Mauzan&quot; (Editorial Mauzan Posters) and created between 130 and 150 posters in the six years he spent in Argentina. He marks deeply in the poster art in Argentina, where his reputation is enormous. One of his well-known works is the amicably tortured head of Geniol.

In the 1950s Uruguayan-Argentine journalist, caricaturist Hermenegildo Sábat, portrayed political figures, as well as artists and other personalities. Many of his &quot;Argentine cultural icons&quot; are reproduced in ceramic tile in the Buenos Aires Underground.

===Comics===
Argentine comics were living its &quot;Golden Age&quot; between the 1940s and the 1960s. Cartoonists and comic creators have contributed prominently to national culture, including Alberto Breccia, Dante Quinterno, Oski, Francisco Solano López, Horacio Altuna, Guillermo Mordillo, Roberto Fontanarrosa, whose grotesque characters captured life&#x27;s absurdities with quick-witted commentary, and Quino, known for the soup-hating Mafalda, and her comic strip gang of childhood friends, the theorist Oscar Masotta synthesized its contributions in the development of their own models of action comics (Héctor Oesterheld, Hugo Pratt), humor comics (Divito, Quino) and folkloric comics (Walter Ciocca) and the presence of four great artists (José Luis Salinas, Arturo Pérez del Castillo, Hugo Pratt and Alberto Breccia).

===Architecture===
The architecture of Argentina can be said to start at the beginning of the Spanish colonization, though it was in the 18th century that the cities of the country reached their splendour. Cities like Córdoba, Salta, Mendoza, and also Buenos Aires conserved most their historical Spanish colonial architecture in spite of their urban growth.

The simplicity of the &quot;Rioplatense&quot; baroque style can be clearly appreciated in Buenos Aires, in the works of Italian architects such as André Blanqui and Antonio Masella, in the churches of San Ignacio, Nuestra Señora del Pilar, the Cathedral, and the Cabildo.

Italian and French influences increased after the war for independence at the beginning of the 19th century, though the academic style persisted until the first decades of the 20th century. Attempts at renovation took place during the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, when the European tendencies penetrated into the country, reflected in numerous important buildings of Buenos Aires, such as the Santa Felicitam Church, by Ernesto Bunge; the Central Post Office and Palace of Justice, by Norbert Maillart; and the National Congress and the Colón Opera House, by Vittorio Meano.

The architecture of the second half of the 20th century continued adapting French neoclassical architecture, such as the headquarters of the National Bank of Argentina, and the NH Gran Hotel Provincial, built by Alejandro Bustillo, and the Museo de Arte Hispano Fernández Blanco, by Martín Noel.

Numerous Argentine architects have enriched their own country&#x27;s cityscapes, and in recent decades, those around the world. Juan Antonio Buschiazzo helped popularize Beaux-Arts architecture, and Francisco Gianotti combined Art Nouveau with Italianate styles, each adding flair to Argentine cities during the early 20th century. Francisco Salamone and Viktor Sulĉiĉ left an Art Deco legacy, and Alejandro Bustillo created a prolific body of Rationalist architecture. Clorindo Testa introduced Brutalist architecture locally, César Pelli&#x27;s and Patricio Pouchulu&#x27;s Futurist creations have graced cities, worldwide. Pelli&#x27;s 1980s throwbacks to the Art Deco glory of the 1920s, in particular, made him one of the world&#x27;s most prestigious architects.

Argentina cities have varied architecture. Commonly each house has an individual design, and is very rare to find any tract housing neighborhood.

Another example of Argentine architecture is the Curutchet House, located in La Plata, was designed by the Swiss-French architect Charles-Édouard Jeanneret. In 2016 it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

==Popular culture==
===Cinema===
The Argentine film industry created around 170 full-length titles in 2012. The world&#x27;s first animated feature films were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist Quirino Cristiani, in 1917 and 1918. Argentine cinema enjoyed a &#x27;golden age&#x27; in the 1930s through the 1950s with scores of productions, many now considered classics of Spanish-language film. The industry produced actors who became the first movie stars of Argentine cinema, often tango performers such as Libertad Lamarque, Floren Delbene, Tito Lusiardo, Tita Merello, Roberto Escalada, and Hugo del Carril.

More recent films from the &quot;New Wave&quot; of cinema since the 1980s have achieved worldwide recognition, such as &quot;The Official Story&quot; (Best foreign film Oscar in 1986), &quot;Man Facing Southeast&quot;, &quot;A Place in the World&quot;, &quot;Nine Queens&quot;, &quot;Son of the Bride&quot;, &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;, &quot;Blessed by Fire&quot;, &quot;The Secret in Their Eyes&quot;, winner of the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and &quot;Wild Tales&quot;. Although rarely rivaling Hollywood productions in popularity, local films are released weekly, and widely followed in Argentina and internationally. A number of local films, many of which are low-budget productions, have earned prizes in cinema festivals (such as Cannes), and are promoted by events such as the Mar del Plata Film Festival and the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema.

The per capita number of screens is one of the highest in Latin America, and viewing per capita is the highest in the region. A new generation of Argentine directors have caught the attention of critics worldwide. Cinema is an important facet of local culture, as well as a popular pastime, and levels of cinema attendance are comparable to those of European countries. Argentine composers Luis Bacalov, Gustavo Santaolalla, and Eugenio Zanetti have been honored with Academy Award for Best Original Score nods. Lalo Schifrin has received numerous Grammys, and is best known for the &quot;&quot; theme.

===Music===


&quot;Tango&quot;, the music and lyrics (often sung in a form of slang called &quot;lunfardo&quot;), is Argentina&#x27;s musical symbol. The Milonga dance was a predecessor, slowly evolving into modern &quot;tango&quot;. By the 1930s, tango had changed from a dance-focused music to one of lyric and poetry, with singers such as Carlos Gardel, Hugo del Carril, Roberto Goyeneche, Raúl Lavié, Tita Merello, and Edmundo Rivero. The golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of jazz and swing in the United States, featuring large orchestral groups too, like the bands of Osvaldo Pugliese, Aníbal Troilo, Francisco Canaro, Julio de Caro, and Juan d&#x27;Arienzo. Incorporating acoustic music and later, synthesizers into the genre after 1955, &quot;bandoneón&quot; virtuoso Astor Piazzolla popularized &quot;new tango&quot; creating a more subtle, intellectual and listener-oriented trend. Today, tango enjoys worldwide popularity; ever-evolving, &quot;neo-tango&quot; is a global phenomenon with groups like Tanghetto, Bajofondo, and the Gotan Project.

Argentine rock, called &quot;rock nacional&quot;, is the most popular music among the youth. Arguably the most listened-to form of Spanish-language rock, its influence and international success are owed to a rich, uninterrupted development. Bands such as Soda Stereo or Sumo, and composers like Charly García, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Fito Páez and Andrés Calamaro are referents of national culture. Mid-1960s Buenos Aires and Rosario were cradles of the music, and by 1970, Argentine rock was well established among middle class youth (see: Almendra, Sui Generis, Pappo, Crucis, Pescado Rabioso). Serú Girán bridged the gap into the 1980s, when Argentine bands became popular across Latin America and elsewhere (Enanitos Verdes, Fabulosos Cadillacs and Virus). There are many subgenres: underground, pop-oriented, and some associated with the working class (La Renga, Divididos, Hermética, V8 and Los Redonditos). Current popular bands include Babasónicos, Los Auténticos Decadentes, Rata Blanca, Horcas, Attaque 77, Bersuit, Los Piojos, Catupecu Machu, Carajo and Callejeros.

European classical music is well represented in Argentina. Buenos Aires is home to the Colón Theater. Classical musicians, such as Martha Argerich, Eduardo Alonso-Crespo, Daniel Barenboim, Eduardo Delgado, and Alberto Lysy, and classical composers such as Juan José Castro and Alberto Ginastera, and contemporary composers such as Osvaldo Golijov, Gerardo Gandini, and Oscar Edelstein are internationally acclaimed. All major cities in Argentina have impressive theaters or opera houses, and provincial or city orchestras. Some cities have annual events and important classical music festivals like Semana Musical Llao Llao in San Carlos de Bariloche, and the multitudinous Amadeus in Buenos Aires.
Argentine folk music is uniquely vast. Beyond dozens of regional dances, a national folk style emerged in the 1930s. Perón&#x27;s Argentina would give rise to Nueva Canción, as artists began expressing in their music objections to political themes. Atahualpa Yupanqui, folk musician, and Mercedes Sosa would be defining figures in shaping Nueva Canción, gaining worldwide popularity in the process. The style found a huge reception in Chile, where it took off in the 1970s, and went on to influence the entirety of Latin American music. Today, Chango Spasiuk and Soledad Pastorutti have brought folk back to younger generations. León Gieco&#x27;s &quot;folk-rock&quot; bridged the gap between Argentine folklore and Argentine rock, introducing both styles to millions overseas in successive tours.

===Theater===
Buenos Aires is one of the world&#x27;s great capitals of theater. The Teatro Colón is a national landmark for opera and classical performances; built at the end of the 19th century, its acoustics are considered the best in the world, and is currently undergoing a major refurbishment in order to preserve its outstanding sound characteristics, the French-romantic style, the impressive Golden Room (a minor auditorium targeted to Chamber Music performances), and the museum at the entrance. With its theater scene of national and international caliber, Corrientes Avenue is synonymous with the art. It is thought of as &quot;the street that never sleeps&quot;, and sometimes referred to as the Broadway of Buenos Aires. Many great careers in acting, music, and film have begun in its many theaters. The &quot;Teatro General San Martín&quot; is one of the most prestigious, along Corrientes Avenue, and the &quot;Teatro Nacional Cervantes&quot; functions as the national stage theater of Argentina. The &quot;Teatro Argentino de La Plata&quot;, &quot;El Círculo&quot; in Rosario, &quot;Independencia&quot; in Mendoza, and &quot;Libertador&quot; in Córdoba are also prominent. Griselda Gambaro, Copi, Roberto Cossa, Marco Denevi, Carlos Gorostiza, and Alberto Vaccarezza are a few of the more prominent Argentine playwrights. Julio Bocca, Jorge Donn, José Neglia, and Norma Fontenla are some of the great ballet dancers of the modern era.

==Cuisine==
Besides many of the pasta, sausage, and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, Argentines enjoy a wide variety of Indigenous and Criollo creations, which include &quot;empanadas&quot; (a stuffed pastry), &quot;locro&quot; (a mixture of maize, beans, meat, bacon, onion, and gourd), humitas, and yerba mate, all originally indigenous Amerindian staples, the latter considered Argentina&#x27;s national beverage. Other popular items include chorizo (a pork sausage), &quot;facturas&quot; (Viennese-style pastry), dulce de leche, a sort of milk caramel jam and the alfajor.

The Argentine barbecue &quot;asado&quot;, includes succulent types of meat, among them chorizo, sweetbread, chitterlings, and &quot;morcilla&quot; (blood sausage). Thin sandwiches, known as sandwiches de miga, are also popular. Argentines have the highest consumption of red meat in the world.

The Argentine wine industry, long among the largest outside Europe, has benefited from growing investment since 1992; in 2007, 60% of foreign investment worldwide in viticulture was destined to Argentina. The country is the fifth most important wine producer in the world, with the annual &quot;per capita&quot; consumption of wine among the highest. Malbec grape, a discardable varietal in France (country of origin), has found in the Province of Mendoza an ideal environment to successfully develop and turn itself into the world&#x27;s best Malbec. Mendoza accounts for 70% of the country&#x27;s total wine production. &quot;Wine tourism&quot; is important in Mendoza province, with the impressive landscape of the Cordillera de Los Andes, and the highest peak in the Americas, Aconcagua ( high) providing a very desirable destination for international tourism.

An event that changed the country&#x27;s gastronomy was the Great European immigration wave to Argentina, millions of Italians, French, Germans, Spaniards, Poles, Irish, Russians, Welsh, Ukrainians and other groups arrived in the country. This caused gastronomy to change completely, the Fugazzeta, the Milanese, the Croissant, the Gnocchi, among other foods are now part of Argentine culture.

==Sports==

The official national sport of Argentina is pato, although it is not very popular. It is played with a six-handle ball on horseback.

Football is the most popular sport in Argentina. The national football team has won 26 major international titles, including three FIFA World Cups, two Olympic gold medals and 16 Copa Américas, the most in the competitions history with the most recent win being Copa América 2024 hosted by the United States. Over one thousand Argentine players play abroad, the majority of them in European football leagues. There are 331,811 registered football players, with increasing numbers of girls and women, who have organized their own national championships since 1991, and were South American champions in 2006.

The Argentine Football Association (AFA) was formed in 1893, and is the eighth oldest national football association in the world. The AFA today counts 3,377 football clubs, including 20 in the Premier Division. Since the AFA went professional in 1931, fifteen teams have won national tournament titles, including River Plate with 33 and Boca Juniors with 24. Over the last twenty years, futsal and beach football have become increasingly popular. The Argentine national beach football team was one of four competitors in the first international championship for the sport, in Miami in 1993.

Basketball is the second most popular sport; a number of basketball players play in the NBA and European leagues including Emanuel Ginóbili, Andrés Nocioni, Carlos Delfino, Luis Scola, Pablo Prigioni, Juan Ignacio Sánchez and Fabricio Oberto. The national basketball team won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and the bronze medal in 2008. Argentina is currently ranked third by the International Basketball Federation.

Argentina has an important rugby union team, &quot;Los Pumas&quot;, with many of its players playing in Europe. Argentina beat host nation France twice in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, placing them third in the competition, and also finished 4th in the 2015 edition of the World Cup. The Pumas are currently ranked fifth in the official world rankings.

Historically, Argentina has had a strong showing within Auto racing. Juan Manuel Fangio was five times Formula One world champion under four different teams, winning 102 of his 184 international races, and is widely ranked as the greatest driver of all time. Other distinguished racers were Oscar Alfredo Gálvez, Juan Gálvez, José Froilán González and Carlos Reutemann.

Field hockey with the national team &quot;Las Leonas&quot; is one of the world&#x27;s most successful, with four Olympic medals, two World Cups, a World League and seven Champions Trophy. Luciana Aymar is recognized as the best female player in the history of this sport.

Argentina reigns undisputed in Polo, having won more international championships than any other country and been seldom beaten since the 1930s. The Argentine Polo Championship is the sport&#x27;s most important international team trophy. The country is home to most of the world&#x27;s top players, among them Adolfo Cambiaso, the best in Polo history.

Other popular sports include tennis, handball, boxing, volleyball and golf.

The Vamos vamos Argentina chant is a trademark of Argentine fans during sporting events.

==Values==

Argentine values is a shared identity core that brings together actions and thoughts aimed at increasing social capital and fostering the common good among Argentines. As Rokeach state, &quot;Values are the evaluative component of an individual&#x27;s attitudes and beliefs. Values guide how we think about things in terms of what is right/wrong and correct/incorrect. Values trigger positive or negative emotions. Values also guide our actions &quot;(Neuliep, 2009, p. 66). Argentine Values intends to create a community formed by all those who are convinced that Argentina is a great country. Argentina is a collective country where its values focus on diversity and solidarity.

In addition to being a collectivistic society. The Argentines are from traditional customs, but also kind and friendly. The greeting is a crucial element in the Argentine culture where we see that nobody leaves without being greeted; Men kiss women, Women kiss men, and other men kiss men on the cheek.

Another principal value for Argentines is the family. In Argentina, for example, it is prevalent for family members to visit traditionally on Sunday, meetings in which there are music, food, and games. But apart from these types of meetings, the family almost always meets for family events or gatherings such as births, weddings, and similar activities. For me that I had the experience of living three months in the country, it was very nice to see how generations come together, and &quot;values are transmitted across generations&quot; (Prioste, Narciso, Goncalves, &amp; Pereira, 2017).

<doc id="403098" wikidata="Q3689146" url="?curid=403098" title="Contract with America">
<text>The Contract with America was a legislative agenda advocated by the Republican Party during the 1994 congressional election campaign. Written by Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey, and in part using text from former president Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1985 State of the Union Address, the contract detailed the actions the Republicans promised to take if they became the majority party in the United States House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. Many of the contract&#x27;s policy ideas originated at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

The Contract with America was introduced six weeks before the 1994 congressional election, the first midterm election of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration, and was signed by all but two of the Republican members of the House and all of the party&#x27;s non-incumbent Republican congressional candidates.

The contract described the plan of the congressional representatives, seeking to nationalize the congressional election. Its provisions represented the view of many conservative Republicans on the issues of reducing the size of government, cutting taxes, and both tort reform and welfare reform.

The 1994 elections resulted in Republicans gaining 54 House and 8 U.S. Senate seats, flipping both chambers. The contract was seen as a triumph by party leaders such as Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and the American conservative movement.

==Content==
The contract&#x27;s text included a list of eight reforms the Republicans promised to enact, and ten bills they promised to bring to floor debate and votes, if they were made the majority following the election. During the crafting of the contract, proposals were limited to &quot;60% issues&quot;, i.e. legislation that polling showed garnered 60% support of the American people, intending for the contract to avoid promises on controversial and divisive matters like abortion and school prayer. Reagan biographer Lou Cannon characterized the contract as having taken more than half of its text from Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1985 State of the Union Address.

===Government and operational reforms===
On the first day of their majority in the House, the Republicans promised to bring up for vote, eight major reforms:

# Require all laws that apply to the rest of the country also apply to Congress;
# Select a major, independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Congress for waste, fraud or abuse;
# Cut the number of House committees, and cut committee staff by one-third;
# Limit the terms of all committee chairs;
# Ban the casting of proxy votes in committee;
# Require committee meetings to be open to the public;
# Require a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase;
# Guarantee an honest accounting of the federal budget by implementing zero base-line budgeting.

===Major policy changes===
During the first one hundred days of the 104th Congress, the Republicans pledged &quot;to bring to the floor the following [ten] bills, each to be given a full and open debate, each to be given a clear and fair vote, and each to be immediately available for public inspection&quot;. The text of the proposed bills was included in the contract, which was released prior to the election. These bills were not governmental operational reforms, as the previous promises were; rather, they represented significant changes to policy. They mainly included a balanced budget requirement, tax cuts for small businesses, families and seniors, term limits for legislators, social security reform, tort reform, and welfare reform.

==Implementation==
The contract promised to bring to floor debate and votes ten bills that would implement reform of the federal government. When the 104th Congress assembled in January 1995, the Republican majority sought to implement the contract.

In some cases (e.g. &quot;The National Security Restoration Act&quot; and &quot;The Personal Responsibility Act&quot;), the proposed bills were accomplished by a single act analogous to that which had been proposed in the contract; in other cases (e.g. &quot;The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act&quot;), a proposed bill&#x27;s provisions were split up across multiple acts. Most of the bills died in the Senate, except as noted below.

=== Congressional Accountability Act ===

===Fiscal Responsibility Act===
An amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget unless sanctioned by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress (H.J.Res.1, passed by the US House Roll Call: 300-132, January 26, 1995, but rejected by the US Senate: Roll Call 65–35 (the amendment was defeated by a single vote, with one Republican opposed, Oregon Republican senator Mark Hatfield; Bob Dole cast a procedural vote against the amendment to bring it up again in the future), March 2, 1995, two-thirds required. 

===Taking Back Our Streets Act===
An anti-crime package including stronger truth in sentencing, &quot;good faith&quot; exclusionary rule exemptions (H.R.666 Exclusionary Rule Reform Act, passed US House Roll Call 289–142 February 8, 1995), death penalty provisions (H.R.729 Effective Death Penalty Act, passed US House Roll Call 297–132 February 8, 1995; similar provisions enacted under S. 735 , April 24, 1996), funding prison construction (H.R.667 Violent Criminal Incarceration Act, passed US House Roll Call 265–156 February 10, 1995, rc#117) and additional law enforcement (H.R.728 Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act, passed US House Roll Call 238–192 February 14, 1995).

===Personal Responsibility Act===
An act to discourage illegitimacy and teen pregnancy by reforming and cutting cash welfare and related programs. This would be achieved by prohibiting welfare to mothers under 18 years of age, denying increased Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) for additional children while on welfare, and enacting a two-years-and-out provision with work requirements to promote individual responsibility. H.R.4, &quot;the Family Self-Sufficiency Act&quot;, included provisions giving food vouchers to unwed mothers under 18 in lieu of cash AFDC benefits, denying cash AFDC benefits for additional children to people on AFDC, requiring recipients to participate in work programs after two years on AFDC, complete termination of AFDC payments after five years, and suspending driver and professional licenses of people who fail to pay child support. H.R.4, passed by the US House 234–199, March 23, 1995, and passed by the US Senate 87–12, September 19, 1995. The act was vetoed by President Clinton, but the alternative Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act which offered many of the same policies was enacted August 22, 1996.

===American Dream Restoration Act===
An act to create a $500-per-child tax credit, add a tax credit for couples who pay more taxes in aggregate if they are married than if they were single (but keep in place the concept of Earned Income Splitting), and creation of American Dream Savings Accounts to provide middle-class tax relief. H.R.1215, passed 246–188, April 5, 1995.

===National Security Restoration Act===
An act to prevent U.S. troops from serving under United Nations command unless the president determines it is necessary for the purposes of national security, to cut U.S. payments for UN peacekeeping operations, and to help establish guidelines for the voluntary integration of former Warsaw Pact nations into NATO. H.R.7, passed 241–181, February 16, 1995.

===Common Sense Legal Reform Act===
An act to institute &quot;loser pays&quot; laws (H.R.988, passed 232–193, March 7, 1995), limits on punitive damages and weakening of product liability laws to prevent what the bill considered frivolous litigation (H.R.956, passed 265–161, March 10, 1995; passed Senate 61–37, May 11, 1995, vetoed by President Clinton. Another tort reform bill, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, was enacted in 1995 when Congress overrode Clinton&#x27;s veto.

===Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act===
A package of measures to act as small-business incentives: capital-gains cuts and indexation, neutral cost recovery, risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis, strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act and unfunded mandate reform to create jobs and raise worker wages. Although this was listed as a single bill in the contract, its provisions ultimately made it to the House Floor as four bills:
* H.R.5, requiring federal funding for state spending mandated by congressional action and estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost more than $50 million per year (for the years of 1996–2002), was passed 360–74, February 1, 1995. This bill was conferenced with S. 1 and enacted, March 22, 1995 
* H.R.450 required a moratorium on the implementation of federal regulations until June 30, 1995, and was passed 276–146, February 24, 1995. Companion Senate bill S. 219 passed by voice vote, May 17, 1995, but the two bills never emerged from conference 
* H.R.925 required federal compensation to be paid to property owners when federal government actions reduced the value of the property by 20% or more, and was passed 277–148, March 3, 1995.
* H.R.926, passed 415–14 on March 1, 1995, required federal agencies to provide a cost-benefit analysis on any regulation costing $50 million or more annually, to be signed off on by the Office of Management and Budget, and permitted small businesses to sue that agency if they believed the analysis was performed inadequately or incorrectly.

===Citizen Legislature Act===

An amendment to the Constitution that would have imposed 12-year term limits on members of Congress (i.e. six terms for representatives, two terms for senators). rejected by the House 227–204 (a constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority, not a simple majority), March 29, 1995; RC #277.

===Other sections===
Other sections of the contract include a proposed Family Reinforcement Act (tax incentives for adoption, strengthening the powers of parents in their children&#x27;s education, stronger child pornography laws, and elderly dependent care tax credit) and the Senior Citizens Fairness Act (raise the Social Security earnings limit, repeal the 1993 tax hikes on Social Security benefits and provide tax incentives for private long-term care insurance).

==Non-implementation==
A November 13, 2000, article by Edward H. Crane, president of the libertarian Cato Institute, stated, &quot;the combined budgets of the 95 major programs that the contract with America promised to eliminate have increased by 13%.&quot;

==Effects==
Some observers cite the contract with America as having helped secure a decisive victory for the Republicans in the 1994 elections; others dispute this role, noting its late introduction into the campaign. Whatever the role of the contract, Republicans were elected to a majority of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1953, and some parts of the contract were enacted. Most elements did not pass Congress, while others were vetoed by, or substantially altered in negotiations with President Bill Clinton, who would sarcastically refer to it as the &quot;Contract on America&quot; implying that the Republicans&#x27; legislative package was akin to an organized-crime &quot;hit&quot; on the American public. As a blueprint for the policy of the new congressional majority, authors Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue in &quot;The Right Nation&quot; that the contract placed Congress back in the driver&#x27;s seat of domestic government policy for most of the 104th Congress, and placed the Clinton White House on the defensive.

George Mason University law professor David E. Bernstein has argued that the contract &quot;show[ed] ... that [Congress took] federalism and limited national government seriously&quot;, and &quot;undoubtedly made [the Supreme Court decision in] &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; more viable&quot;.

== Commentary ==

Journalist and senior congressional reporter Major Garrett equated the contract with a game of miniature golf, &quot;fun, popular, and largely diversionary exercise meant to satisfy middle-class sensibilities&quot;, contrasted with the golf of governing America and leadership. Republicans interviewed by Garrett when the contract was being compiled said it was meant to be a political document of easy goals, not a governing document, with one senior aide explaining, &quot;We don&#x27;t care if the Senate passes any of the items in the contract. It would be preferable, but it&#x27;s not necessary. If the freshmen do everything the contract says, they&#x27;ll be in excellent shape for 1996&quot;.

In 2014, business and finance writer John Steele Gordon, writing in &quot;The American&quot;, an online magazine published by the American Enterprise Institute, praised the contract, calling it the main reason for the Republican victory in 1994&quot;, in part because it &quot;nationalized the election&quot;.

<doc id="403102" wikidata="Q761877" url="?curid=403102" title="Democratic Alliance (South Africa)">
<text>The Democratic Alliance (DA) is a liberal South African political party. The party has been the second-largest in South Africa since its foundation in 2000. The party is broadly centrist, and has also been associated with centre-right policies. 

It is a member of Liberal International and the Africa Liberal Network. 
The DA traces its roots to the founding of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party in 1959, with many mergers and name changes between that time and the present. The DA has a variety of ideologically liberal tendencies, including neoliberalism, social liberalism, classical liberalism, and conservative liberalism. The party draws its support predominantly from Afrikaans and English speakers, people aged over 35, and white South Africans, as well as the Indian and Coloured communities.

The current leader of the party is John Steenhuisen, who was announced as the new leader on 1 November 2020 after the party&#x27;s Federal Congress. He had previously acted as the interim leader of the party from November 2019 to November 2020. Helen Zille is chairperson of both the Federal Council and the Federal Executive, the highest decision-making structures of the party. 

In aftermath of the 2024 general election, the DA entered into a ruling grand coalition with the African National Congress (ANC) and various other parties, called a government of national unity, formed between ten parties with jointly 287 seats in the National Assembly of South Africa (72%). The DA also governs several major metropolitan municipalities and has governed the Western Cape, one of South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces, since the 2009 general election.

== History ==

===Beginnings in the Democratic Party===
Although the Democratic Alliance in its present form is fairly new, its roots can be traced far back in South African political history, through a complex sequence of splits and mergers. The modern day DA is in large part a product of the white parliamentary opposition to the ruling National Party. The origin of the party can be traced to the mid-1950s when some younger members of the United Party felt that they were not providing strong enough opposition to the National Party and its policy of Apartheid, causing them to break away and form the Progressive Party in 1959. In the 1970s, as it rose to become the official opposition, the party merged with more splinters from the disintegrating United Party and become known first as the Progressive Reform Party and then as the Progressive Federal Party. The Progressives sought to change the system from within, but in doing so chose to comply with Apartheid legislation outlawing multi-racial membership. During this time, the party was led by liberal-minded opponents of Apartheid, such as Jan Steytler, Helen Suzman, Zach de Beer, Colin Eglin, Frederik van Zyl Slabbert and Harry Schwarz. In 1989, it merged with two smaller reformist organisations to become the Democratic Party (DP), a name that was retained into the 1990s when freedom was achieved. It was marginalised by the National Party&#x27;s shift towards the center after 1990, and fared relatively poorly in the first democratic election in 1994, won by the African National Congress.

The DP established itself as a more effective party of opposition, however, and eventually rose from relative obscurity and ascended to the status of official opposition in 1999 under the leadership of Tony Leon, mainly by taking votes from the New National Party, the renamed version of the NP. The party also became kingmakers in the Western Cape province, where it formed a coalition government with the NNP. With a fractured national opposition standing against an increasingly dominant governing party, there was a perceived need to better challenge the ANC. To this end, the DP reached a merger agreement with the NNP and the much smaller Federal Alliance (FA) in 2000. Together, they formed the Democratic Alliance. The merger was ultimately aborted, with both the NNP and FA leaving the DA. Many former NNP members remained, and the new name was kept.

The DP was disbanded after the 2003 floor crossing period, establishing the DA at all levels of government.

=== Since becoming the Democratic Alliance in 2003 ===

The party consolidated its status as the official opposition in the 2004 general election, while the NNP collapsed. Having gone into opposition in the Western Cape in 2001 when the NNP formed a new coalition with the ANC, the demise of the NNP made the province a natural target for the party. In the 2006 municipal elections, the DA narrowly gained control of its largest city, Cape Town, in a multi-party coalition. Helen Zille, the executive mayor of Cape Town, then succeeded Leon as DA Party Leader in May 2007. In 2008, she re-launched the party as one that no longer acts solely as an opposition but also as an alternative choice for government. The party also introduced a new logo and a new slogan. Zille said the new DA would be &quot;more reflective of our rich racial, linguistic and cultural heritage,&quot; and emphasized that she wanted it to be a &quot;party for all the people&quot; and not decline into a &quot;shrinking, irrelevant minority.&quot; In the 2009 South African general election, the DA won an overall majority in the Western Cape, and Zille became the new provincial premier. In her newsletter, she wrote that &quot;winning power in the Western Cape will allow us to show what co-operative governance between local authorities and a province can achieve.&quot; In the 2011 local government elections, the party won control of most of the municipalities in the Western Cape.

In 2013, the DA launched the &quot;Know Your DA&quot; campaign, in an attempt to try to show that the DA (via its proxy predecessor organisations) was involved in the struggle against apartheid. This campaign focused mainly on the role played by a few key individuals in opposing apartheid – particularly Helen Suzman and Helen Zille. The campaign received a certain amount of media attention, much of it somewhat sceptical. The ANC issued a detailed critique of the campaign, focusing especially on Suzman&#x27;s role in the apartheid parliament. Partially on the basis of this campaign the DA contested the 2014 general election, where it once again grew its support base but failed in its stated goal of winning Gauteng province.

In the municipal elections of 2016, the DA made significant gains along with other opposition parties in some of the country&#x27;s most important metropolitan areas. The DA currently governs Tshwane (including Pretoria, the administrative capital), Cape Town (South Africa&#x27;s second-largest city and legislative capital) and various other municipalities.

In the general elections of 2019, the DA&#x27;s national support declined for the first time in its history. The party retained control of the Western Cape but with a reduced majority and failed to win Gauteng once again. The conservative Freedom Front Plus (FF+) made significant gains on the DA in the Afrikaner community. In the aftermath of the election, the FF+ continued to make inroads in former DA strongholds. 

In the run-up to the 2024 general election, the DA joined the Multi-Party Charter, an electoral alliance taking advantage of the unpopularity of the ANC. The ANC failed to gain a majority of seats in the National Assembly after the election, leading to the DA agreeing to form a coalition of national unity (Third Cabinet of Cyril Ramaphosa), entering ruling government for the first time.

== Ideology and principles ==
The DA sums up its political philosophy as the belief in an &quot;Open Opportunity Society for All&quot;. Former party leader Helen Zille has argued that this stands in direct contrast to the ruling ANC&#x27;s approach to governance, which she maintains has led to a &quot;closed, crony society for some&quot;. This formed the basis of the philosophy underlying the party&#x27;s 2009 Election Manifesto, which seeks to build a society by linking outcomes to &quot;opportunity, effort and ability&quot;.

The DA&#x27;s historical roots are broadly liberal-democratic. During the 1990s, the party remained associated with liberal values, though party leader Tony Leon&#x27;s support for the reintroduction of the death penalty, the party&#x27;s controversial 1999 campaign slogan &quot;Fight Back&quot;, and the short-lived alliance with the centre-right New National Party fuelled criticisms of the party from the left. After Helen Zille&#x27;s election as party leader, the DA has attempted to reposition itself as a mainstream alternative to the ANC. The party&#x27;s economic policy is also broadly centrist, and supports a mix of high spending on crucial social services such as education and health care, a basic income grant, and a strong regulatory framework, with more &quot;moderate&quot; policies such as a lower budget deficit and a deregulated labour market. At her 2009 State of the Province speech, party leader Zille described her party&#x27;s economic policy as pragmatic: &quot;We believe the state has a crucial role to play in socio-economic development. We are not free market fundamentalists. By the same token we do not believe that a state, with limited capacity, should over-reach itself.&quot;

=== Current policies ===

==== Crime ====

In the DA&#x27;s crime plan, &quot;Conquering Fear, Commanding Hope&quot;, the DA committed itself to increasing the number of police officers to 250,000. This is 60,000 more than the government&#x27;s own target. The party also announced plans to employ 30,000 additional detectives and forensics experts and 500 more prosecutors, in order to reduce court backlogs, and establish a Directorate for Victims of Crime, which would provide funding and support for crime victims.

In addition, the party announced its support for a prison labour programme, which would put prisoners to work in various community upliftment programmes. The proposal was criticised by labour unions, who believed it was unethical and would result in labour job losses.

In late 2008–2009, the DA took a stand against the South African Police Service&#x27;s VIP Protection Unit, after several officers in the unit were charged with serious criminal offences. The party later released documentation of the unit&#x27;s poor disciplinary record, and claimed its divisional commander had himself dodged serious criminal charges.

The DA strongly opposed the disbandment of the Scorpions crime investigation unit, and similar efforts to centralise the police service such as the nationwide disbandment of specialised Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) units.

The party adopted a resolution declaring farm attacks and murders as hate crimes at its 2020 Federal Congress.

====Social development====

Central to the DA&#x27;s social development policy, &quot;Breaking the Cycle of Poverty&quot;, is a Basic Income Grant, which would provide a monthly transfer of R110 to all adults earning less than R46,000 per year. The party also supports legislation that would require the legal guardians of children living in poverty to ensure that their child attends 85 per cent of school classes, and undergoes routine health check-ups.

In addition, to aid with youth development skills, the party proposed a R6000 opportunity voucher or twelve month community service programme to all high school matriculants. The party also supports a universal old age pension, and the abolishment of pension means tests.

====Education====

The DA&#x27;s education programme, &quot;Preparing for Success&quot;, focuses on providing adequate physical and human resources to underperforming schools. The DA supports guaranteed access to a core minimum of resources for each school, proper state school nutrition schemes for grade 1–12 learners, and measures to train 30,000 additional teachers per year. The DA continues to support the introduction of new performance targets for teachers and schools, and also advocates a per-child wage subsidy, and a national network of community-based early childhood education centres.

====Health====

The DA&#x27;s &quot;Quality Care for All&quot; programme is focused on tackling the country&#x27;s high HIV/AIDS infection rate. Included in these plans is an increase in the number of clinics offering HIV testing and measures to provide all HIV-positive women with Nevirapine. The party&#x27;s health policy also plans to devote more resources to vaccinations against common childhood illnesses.

The party also advocates creating a transparent and competitive health sector, to boost service delivery and encourage health care practitioners to remain in the country.

====Economy====

The DA&#x27;s economic policy aims to create a society in which all South Africans enjoy both the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, and the opportunities to take advantage of those freedoms. In its 2010 Federal Congress booklet, &quot;The Open Opportunity Society for All&quot;, the party describes this society in the following terms: &quot;Opportunity is the vehicle with which people are empowered to live their lives, pursue their dreams and develop their full potential. And the DA believes that the role of the government is to provide every citizen with a minimum basic standard of quality services and resources with which to be able to do so – a framework for choice.&quot;

The DA therefore advocates a mixed-economy approach, where the state is involved in the economy only to the extent that it can expand opportunity and choice.

The manifesto includes various proposals detailing how a DA government would manage the economy and facilitate growth. The majority of the interventions suggested by the party are aimed at creating an atmosphere conducive to job creation and greater foreign direct investment.

The DA has suggested measures to make South Africa&#x27;s labour market more amenable to job creation. The party has also suggested several targeted interventions to allow for higher employment, especially amongst the youth. These interventions include a wage subsidy programme to reduce the cost of hiring first-time workers.

The DA has committed itself to a counter-cyclical fiscal policy approach. This is evident in the party&#x27;s previous alternative budget frameworks, with both alternative budgets posting deficits. The party defended this stance by arguing that increased spending was necessary to help the economy out of recession. Other fiscal interventions have included a proposed scrapping of value added tax (VAT) on books and tax rebates for crime prevention expenditure by businesses.

The DA supports an inflation-targeting monetary policy regime similar to that of the ANC government. It has also repeatedly reaffirmed its support and commitment for reserve bank instrument independence. The DA proposes to incentivise savings by reducing taxes on income earned from fixed deposits that are held for longer than twelve months. The party states that this would help South Africa to boost its domestic savings rate to enable the country to invest in projects that will provide additional job opportunities.

The party has rejected the ANC&#x27;s approach to Black Economic Empowerment, with former party leader Helen Zille arguing that the current policies have only served to enrich a small elite of politically connected businessmen. The party proposed an alternative it calls broad-based economic empowerment, which would provide for targeted interventions focusing on skills training and socio-economic investment instead of ownership targets. The party believes that this approach will give a broader group of black South Africans an opportunity to compete and partake in the economy.

The party advocates an active industrial policy that allows the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) to co-ordinate industrial policy. Additionally it would also set up a sovereign venture capital fund to help support innovation in key industries. The DA also supports the creation of Industrial Development Zones and Export Processing Zones. The party suggests that by relaxing certain regulations in these zones, manufacturers and exporters would be able to grow faster and employ more people. This fits into the party&#x27;s broader vision of growing the economy by cutting red tape and regulations it claims is holding back South Africa&#x27;s economic growth.

The DA has been against the introduction of a national minimum wage, arguing that workers should be allowed to accept a wage of less than R3500 on their own terms. In contrast, President Cyril Ramaphosa stated that the R3500 per month (R20 an hour) minimum wage was still not a living wage, and would only &quot;advance the struggle for a living wage&quot;.

====Land====

The DA is resolutely against land expropriation without compensation. This is in response to the ANC and the EFF&#x27;s recent attempts to change section 25 of the Constitution which deals with land reform. The DA says that changing the Constitution will open the floodgates and undermine property rights, allowing government to own all land and forcing all South Africans to be only permanent tenants of the land. The party says that it is committed to ensuring that those entitled to land receive it in the form of direct ownership, and not as lifelong tenants.

The DA&#x27;s &quot;Land of Opportunity&quot; programme supports the &quot;willing buyer, willing seller&quot; principle, though it also allows for expropriation for reform purposes in certain limited circumstances. The party has been critical of the resources that government has allocated to land reform, claiming that government has not been sufficiently active in buying up land that comes onto the market. Though the DA believes this could speed up the pace of land reform, their policies have been vocally criticised by members of the Tripartite Alliance. Land Affairs Minister Thoko Didiza accused the DA of attempting to &quot;stifle&quot; land reform, while the South African Communist Party contended that the DA&#x27;s policies overly favoured big business. In a speech at the DA&#x27;s national congress in April 2018, DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, praised DA Western Cape Provincial Leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, for overseeing the delivery of 91 000 title deeds in the province and allowing residents to have full title deeds to their homes.

====Environment and energy====

In the build up to the 2009 elections, the DA announced it would create a new Ministry of Energy and Climate Change, to ensure improved integrated energy planning in order to deal with South Africa&#x27;s growing carbon dioxide emissions. The DA&#x27;s 2009 environment and energy plan, &quot;In Trust for the Nation&quot; proposed new measures to increase energy efficiency, and the introduction of sectoral carbon emission targets.

====Electoral reform====

The DA broadly supports reforms recommended by Frederik van Zyl Slabbert&#x27;s electoral reform task-team, that would see the current party list voting system replaced by a 75% constituency-based/25% proportional representation-based electoral system that would apply at the national and provincial level. The DA&#x27;s governance policy Promoting Open Opportunity Governance also makes provision for the direct election of the president, which would give voters a more direct link to the executive branch.

The DA believe voting rights should be extended to include all South African citizens who are living and working abroad, many of whom intend returning. Since 2013, South Africans living abroad can now register and vote in national elections.

====Foreign policy====

The DA holds a relatively pro-Western foreign policy.

The DA has been a strong supporter of Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War. South Africa, a member of the BRICS alliance, has remained neutral throughout the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the DA (including DA-controlled legislatures and councils) supports Ukraine and has criticised South Africa&#x27;s ambiguous position, though the ANC has denied supporting Russia and insists that it is neutral. Steenhuisen visited Ukraine in 2022 in solidarity. The party has also called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be arrested.

Unlike the ANC, which outspokenly declared its support for Palestine and refused to condemn Hamas for its attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, the DA, along with other members of the Multi-Party Charter, specifically condemned Hamas for its attacks on Israel. However, the DA, like the ANC, supports a two state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, seeking peaceful resolution between the two, and for Palestine to be free, saying &quot;the people of Palestine are not defined by Hamas&quot;.

<doc id="403108" wikidata="Q252291" url="?curid=403108" title="Pran Nath (musician)">
<text>Pandit Pran Nath (Devanagari: पंडित प्राणनाथ) (3 November 1918 – 13 June 1996) was an Indian classical singer and master of the Kirana gharana singing style. Promoting traditional raga principles, Nath exerted an influence on notable American minimalist and jazz musicians, including La Monte Young, Terry Riley, and Don Cherry. He began performing in the United States in the 1970s, and established the Kirana Center for Indian Classical Music in 1972; he subsequently taught in various universities across the US and Europe.

==Early life==
Pran Nath was born into a wealthy family in Lahore in present-day Pakistan. While they were avid devotees of music, inviting musicians into the house to perform nightly, his family did not approve of his desire to become a musician, so he left home at the age of 13 and took up residence with the reclusive singer Abdul Wahid Khan of the Kirana gharana, cousin of the more widely known Abdul Karim Khan.

Pran Nath served Khan for seven years before he was accepted as a student, and stayed with Khan for nearly two decades. Both guru and disciple were much attracted to mysticism: Abdul Wahid Khan, a Muslim, to Sufism; and Nath, a Hindu, to a Shaivite sect in Dehra Dun. It is said that Nath lived in a cave near the Tapkeswhar temple to Shiva for five years, serving his guru intermittently. He eventually married and reentered the world at the request (guru dakshana) of his guru, in order to ensure the preservation of the Kirana style. In 1937, he became a staff artist with All India Radio.

However, Nath stuck to Abdul Wahid Khan&#x27;s extra-methodical and austere singing style, with a heavy emphasis on alap and slow tempo, which suited his voice well but was not very popular. Like his teacher, Pran Nath&#x27;s singing emphasized precise intonation and the gradual, note-by-note exposition of tone and mood in the alap section of the music.

Nath supported himself as a music teacher, and worked at the University of Delhi from 1960 to 1970.

==Life in the United States==
In 1970, Pran Nath travelled to New York to visit the American composer La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela, who heard his first issued recording, &quot;Earth Groove: The Voice of Cosmic India&quot; (1968). In 1972, he established the Kirana Center for Indian Classical Music in New York City and lived in the US for the rest of his life. He was a visiting professor of music at Mills College, teaching one semester a year from 1973 to 1984.

In 1985, he moved to the San Francisco area, and he continued to teach privately in the United States, Canada, Europe, and India. His album &quot;Ragas of Morning and Night&quot; was released by Gramavision Records in 1986 and he appeared with the Kronos Quartet on their album &quot;Short Stories&quot;, released by Nonesuch Records in 1993.

==Death==

Pandit Pran Nath died of heart failure at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley on 13 June, 1996. He was survived by his wife, Rani Budhiraja Nath; by a son, Bhuwanneshwar; three daughters, Shashi Maini, Kiran Arora and Uma Maini; and by seven grandchildren.

==Influence==
Pran Nath attracted a strong following among the American minimalist composers, including La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Marian Zazeela, Rhys Chatham, Jon Hassell, Catherine Christer Hennix, Charlemagne Palestine, Shabda Kahn, Jon Gibson, Michael Harrison, Yoshi Wada, Henry Flynt, and many others. Jazz musicians such as Don Cherry and Lee Konitz also drew influence from his teaching. Artists such as Simone Forti and David Weinrib were also students of Pran Nath.

==Notable students==
==Discography==
* &quot;Earth Groove&quot; (1968), Ragas Bhupali and Asavari
* &quot;India&#x27;s Master Vocalist&quot; (1972), Ragas Yaman Kalyan and Punjabi Berva
* &quot;Ragas of Morning and Night&quot; (1986), Ragas Miya ki Todi and Darbari Kanada, two ragas for which Pran Nath was particularly noted
* &quot;Midnight&quot; (2003), Raga Malkauns, two separate recordings made in 1971 and 1976
* &quot;The Raga Cycle&quot; (2006), Ragas Shudh Sarang and Kut Todi, recorded in 1972

==Unreleased recordings==
Like his teacher Abdul Wahid Khan, Pran Nath did not emphasize recording or the releasing of records, preferring live performance. While only three recordings of Pran Nath were released during his lifetime, a large number of recordings exist under the care of La Monte Young. In Pran Nath&#x27;s will, Young, as executor of his estate, was instructed to begin releasing recordings.

<text>&#x27; (V; , ), full name &#x27; (), is a conservative-liberal, agrarian political party in Denmark. Founded as part of a peasants&#x27; movement against the landed aristocracy, today it espouses an economically liberal, pro-free-market ideology.

 is the major party of the centre-right in Denmark, and the second-largest party in the country. The party has produced many Prime Ministers. In the 2022 general elections, received 13.3% of the vote and 23 out of 179 seats. Following the resignation of Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, the party is led by Troels Lund Poulsen who serves as the country&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister. Since December 2022, the party has been a junior partner in the second Frederiksen government.

The party is a member of Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) and has four MEPs in the European Parliament.

==History==
=== 1870–1910 ===
Venstre was founded in 1870 under the name &quot;Det Forenede Venstre&quot; (). Originally, the party consisted of multiple conflicting groups, all united under the classical liberal (then the standard left-wing) ideology, the safeguarding of farmers&#x27; interests and opposition to the then right-wing classical conservative party Højre (literally &quot;Right&quot;). After the party in 1872 gained an absolute majority in the Folketing, it became the leading voice in the battle for parliamentarism, whereafter the party in 1895 split in two, Venstrereformpartiet (&quot;Venstre Reform Party&quot;) and Det Moderate Venstre (&quot;The Moderate Left&quot;). In 1905, social liberal factions split from the party and formed Radikale Venstre (also known as the Danish Social Liberal Party), and in 1910 Venstrereformpartiet and Det Moderate Venstre reunited again under the name Venstre.

=== 1910–2009 ===
With the decreasing numbers of farms and the growing urbanisation, membership and voter support dropped in the 1950s. During the 1960s the party gradually evolved from being a traditional farmers&#x27; party to a more general liberal party. In 1984 Uffe Ellemann-Jensen was elected chairman, and by profiling the liberal ideology in sharp confrontation to the Social Democrats, for example by campaigning for a reduction of the public sector, increasing market management and privatisation, and by being pro-EU, the party returned to its historical position as the biggest liberal party in the 1990s.

After a disappointing 1998 general election, Ellemann-Jensen resigned as chairman and Anders Fogh Rasmussen was elected in his place. He immediately changed the party&#x27;s usual confrontational strategy, instead appealing to the political centre. In the 2001 general elections the party campaigned for tighter immigration policies and a &quot;tax stop&quot;, which proved successful and the party once again became the biggest in parliament, winning 31.2% of the vote and 56 seats. Venstre formed a coalition government with the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and the Danish People&#x27;s Party. For the first time since 1929 a liberal government was no longer dependent on the centre parties. Despite a small decline in both the 2005 general elections (29% and 52 seats) and the 2007 general elections (26.2% and 46 seats), the party remained the biggest and the coalition government continued.

On 5 April 2009, Fogh Rasmussen resigned as chairman, instead serving as Secretary General of NATO. In his place Lars Løkke Rasmussen was elected.

=== 2009–present ===
In the 2011 general elections, the party gained 26.7% of the vote and 47 seats, but was not able to form a government, instead leading the opposition against Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt&#x27;s Social Democratic coalition.

Even though the party lost voter support in the 2015 general elections, only gaining 19.5% of the vote, the party formed a minority government. This government was short-lived, and in 2016 Løkke Rasmussen invited the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and the Liberal Alliance to form a coalition government instead.

During the campaign of the 2019 general elections, Løkke Rasmussen published an autobiography, in which he opened up for the possibility of forming a government with the Social Democrats. This was seen as controversial in the liberal &quot;blue bloc&quot;, and Social Democratic leader Mette Frederiksen immediately declined the proposition.

Following internal fighting in the party, Løkke Rasmussen and vice chairman Kristian Jensen both resigned on 31 August 2019. On 21 September 2019, political spokesman and former Minister for Environment and Food Jakob Ellemann-Jensen was elected the party&#x27;s next chairman.

Following the 2022 general election, in which Venstre suffered its worst result since 1988, Venstre joined a grand coalition government led by Social Democrat leader Mette Frederiksen, and also comprising the Moderates, a Venstre splinter formed by former Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen.

==Ideology==

Venstre is categorised as centre-right on the political spectrum, although it has been also described as centrist and right-wing. Ideologically, it has been described as conservative-liberal, liberal-conservative, liberal, conservative, classical-liberal, and agrarian. Additionally, Venstre takes a nativist stance regarding immigration and asylum-seeking; they had also said that &quot;immigrants should learn Danish and understand and respect Danish culture and traditions&quot;.

Venstre is an economically liberal party within the Nordic agrarian tradition, and today is notably more pro–free market than its sister parties. Since the elections in 2001, Venstre has enacted a so-called &quot;tax stop&quot; in order to halt the growth in taxes seen during the previous eight years under the Social Democrats. This tax stop has been under heavy fire from the parties on the left bloc of Danish politics, allegedly for being &quot;asocial&quot; and &quot;only for the rich.&quot;

== Organization ==

=== Name and terms ===
The fact that the major centre-right political party in a country calls itself &#x27;Left&#x27; is often confusing to foreign (and sometimes Danish) observers. The name has, however, its historical explanation. At the time of its foundation, &quot;Venstre&quot; affirmed then-progressive ideas in the Danish parliament. Their opponents, &quot;Højre&quot; (Right), the forerunner of the present-day Conservative People&#x27;s Party, advocated for established interests, particularly the Church of Denmark and the landed gentry. In current Danish politics there is a clear distinction between the concepts of &quot;Venstre&quot; (Left, i.e., the party bearing that name) and &quot;venstrefløj&quot; (left wing, i.e., socialist and other left-leaning parties). The use of the word for &quot;left&quot; in the name of the Danish political party &quot;Radikale Venstre&quot; (literally: &quot;Radical Left&quot;) and the Norwegian party &quot;Venstre&quot; is meant to refer to liberalism and not socialism.

Members of the party are referred to as &quot;venstremænd&quot; and &quot;venstrekvinder&quot;, respectively &quot;Venstre men&quot; and &quot;Venstre women&quot; (singular: -mand, -kvinde).

<text>The Movement of Socialist Democrats (, &#x27;; ,MDS, also translated as &quot;Socialist Democrats Movement&quot;) is a political party in Tunisia.

The MDS was founded by defectors from the then ruling Socialist Destourian Party (PSD) and liberal-minded expatriates in 1978. The founders of the MDS had already been involved in the establishment of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) in 1976/77. Its first secretary general was Ahmed Mestiri who had been a member of the PSD and interior minister in the government of Habib Bourguiba, but was dropped from the government in 1971 and expelled from the party after he had called for democratic reforms and pluralism.

Tunisia was then a single-party state ruled exclusively by the PSD. The MDS remained illegal until 1981 when the more reform-minded Prime Minister Mohammed Mzali allowed oppositional parties to run candidates&#x27; lists in elections and announced to officially recognise them in case they won more than 5%. Among the minor, weakly institutionalised oppositional parties, the MDS presented the most appealing candidates list and threatened to actually beat the PSD in the capital Tunis. The government decided to rig the elections. So, according to official results, the MDS won only 3.2 percent, behind the ruling PSD with 94.6 percent.

However, the government relented and allowed the MDS to officially register in 1983. It was one of three legal oppositional parties during the 1980s. The MDS welcomed Zine El Abidine Ben Ali taking over the presidency from the longterm head of state Bourguiba in 1987. Many MDS members believed that Ben Ali really pursued reforms and liberalisation and defected to his Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), weakening the MDS. Ahmed Mestiri led the party until 1990. In the early 1990s, the party was torn between cooperation with the government and opposition. Those who strove for a strictly oppositional course left the party or were edged out. In 1994, a group of MDS dissidents around Mustapha Ben Jaafar founded the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties (FDTL), which was only legalised in 2002.

In 1994, the electoral law was changed, ensuring the parliamentary representation of oppositional parties. The MDS received 10 of 163 seats (19 being reserved for the opposition). In 1999, it became the largest opposition party, with 13 seats in the Tunisian parliament. In 2001, the then-party leader Mohamed al-Mouadda was charged with having formed a pact with the banned Islamist group Ennahda. At the 2004 parliamentary election, the party won 4.6% of the popular vote and 14 seats. Their number of seats rose to 16 at the 2009 election, making it again the second-largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, behind the dominant Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD).

After the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, the party obtained two seats in the election for the Constituent Assembly.

The MDS has published the Arabic weekly newspapers &quot;Al-Moustaqbal&quot; (&quot;The Future&quot;) and &quot;Al-Ra&#x27;i&quot; (&quot;Opinion&quot;), as well as the French-language &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;.

<doc id="403114" wikidata="Q3741546" url="?curid=403114" title="List of musical instruments by Hornbostel–Sachs number">
<text>The Hornbostel–Sachs system categorizes musical instruments by how they make sound. It divides instruments into five groups: idiophones, membranophones, chordophones, aerophones, and electrophones. A number of instruments also exist outside the five main classes.

==Main categories==
*List of idiophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number
**See also: List of percussion instruments
*List of membranophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number
*List of chordophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number
*List of aerophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number
**See also: List of woodwind instruments

===Electrophones===
Electrophones are instruments in which sound is generated by electrical means. While it is not officially in any published form of the Hornbostel–Sachs system, and hence, lacking proper numerical subdivisions, it is often considered a fifth main category.

*Croix Sonore
*Denis d&#x27;or
*Drum machine
*Hammond organ
*Keyboard bass
*Kraakdoos (or Cracklebox)
*Mellotron
*Ondes Martenot
*Synclavier
*Synthesizer
*Tannerin (a.k.a. Electro-Theremin)
*Telharmonium
*Theremin

==Instruments that do not fit into any of the above five categories==
A number of instruments neither fit wholly into any one of the above 5 categories, nor can they be properly described as belonging to some combination of these categories.
Within the Hornbostel Sachs system they therefore do not have a number (hence the label NaN = Not a Number).

===Hydraulophones===
The first three Hornbostel Sachs numbers describe instruments that make sound from matter in its solid state. The fourth HS number describes instruments that make sound from matter in its gaseous state (air). The fifth HS number describes instruments that make sound from electricity and/or electrical energy.

A number of instruments have been invented, designed, and made, that make sound from matter in its liquid state. This class of instruments is called hydraulophones. Hydraulophones use an incompressible fluid, such as water, as the initial sound-producing medium, and they may also use the hydraulic fluid as a user-interface.

===Plasmaphones===
Another category of instruments has been invented that use matter in higher energy states, such as plasma, to produce the initial sound. These instruments are called plasmaphones. As flame is matter in a high energy state the class comprises the much older pyrophones.

===Non-electrophonic quintephones===
A number of computational musical instruments that are not electrophones have been invented, designed, built, and used in performances. These instruments are sound synthesizers that use mechanical, optical, or other forms of non-electric computation, sampling, processing, or the like.

It has been proposed that music synthesizers that perform computation, and/or that work by recording and playback of sound samples, or the like, be referred to as quintephones. This class of instrument includes electrophones as a special case.

<text>The Conservative People&#x27;s Party (, DKF), also known as The Conservatives () is a centre-right political party in Denmark. The party is a member of the International Democracy Union and the European People&#x27;s Party.

== History ==
The party was founded in 1916 based mostly on its predecessor, &quot;Højre&quot; (&quot;Right&quot;) after its downfall, but also on the Free Conservatives and a moderate faction of the liberal party &quot;Venstre&quot; (&quot;Left&quot;). The party was a part of the coalition government during World War II, where the leader John Christmas Møller provided the voice for BBC London&#x27;s daily radio to Denmark. However, while a number of conservatives participated in the resistance movement, some conservatives were sympathetic to fascist ideology, and the youth wing of the party praised several fascist movements in Europe during the 1930s.

Since World War II, the party has participated in several coalition governments, but only one Prime Minister of Denmark, Poul Schlüter, has come from this party; he served as prime minister from 1982 to 1993. His government had to resign after the Tamil Case, when the Justice Minister, Erik Ninn-Hansen (himself a former Conservative leader), was impeached.

The party used its first logo in 1950, consisting of the serif-letter &quot;C&quot; coloured green. On 24 August 2000, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party rebranded itself as the Conservatives, and at the same time retired its 50-year-old green serif-letter &quot;C&quot; logo, thus launching a new logo for the first time since 1950. The new logo was a circle which contains a chartreuse circle with the letter &quot;C&quot;.

From the 2001 parliament elections until 2011, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party was the junior partner in a coalition government led by Venstre. In the 2004 European parliament elections, the party won a seat. Four months later, on 23 October 2004, it adopted a logo consisting of a green circle-squared box that contains a dark-green screen with the letter &quot;C&quot; that is coloured green; the &quot;Konservative&quot; wordmark is placed below the symbol, though it too is also coloured green. The member is currently Bendt Bendtsen, who is a member of the EPP Group in the European Parliament. In the 2014 European election, the party garnered 9.1% of the national vote, retaining Bendtsen&#x27;s seat as MEP.

In the 2011 parliamentary election for the Folketing (Danish national parliament), the Conservative People&#x27;s Party won eight seats, 10 fewer than it had won in the previous election in 2007, and it received 4.9% of the vote, placing the party in eighth place nationally. On 27 September 2013, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party received the current version of its logo: the colour of the letter &quot;C&quot; was changed to white, the circle-square retained its dark-green colour, and the circle-squared line was removed from it. At the same time, the party gave up being known as the Conservatives, reverting to its former name as the Conservative People&#x27;s Party.

At the 2015 election, the party did badly and was reduced to a mere six seats, which made it the smallest party in the Folketing. But Søren Pape Poulsen (who had taken over as leader the previous year) managed to double the party&#x27;s seats to 12 in the 2019 election with 6.6% of the vote. After that election, several opinion polls indicated that the party enjoyed wider popular support than Venstre, but at the 2022 election gained just 5.5%, following an election campaign significantly influenced by affairs concerning Pape Poulsen&#x27;s personal life. Poulsen died suddenly at the age of 52 on 2 March 2024, leaving the party leadership vacant.

== Organization ==
The youth branch of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party, albeit an independent organisation, is Young Conservatives, the earliest formed youth organisation in Denmark, founded in December 1904, and believed to be one of the oldest in the world, preceding the Conservative People&#x27;s Party by 10 years. The student branch is Conservative Students, likewise an independent organisation, which has branches at all Danish Universities.

The party remains committed to a centre-right alliance, working most closely with the liberal Venstre and somewhat less closely with the right-wing populist Danish People&#x27;s Party. The Conservative People&#x27;s Party cooperated with the Social Liberal Party during its time in power in the 1980s, and also with the centre-left government under Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in the 1990s.

== Ideology and policies ==

The party&#x27;s current purpose clause states: &quot;The Conservative People&#x27;s Party aims to gather everyone who joins the party&#x27;s program and to work for the spread of conservative views.&quot; The party has named Edmund Burke as one of its intellectual sources.

The Conservative People&#x27;s Party presently advocates individual freedom and responsibility, a free market economy, respecting private property, the importance of community for the individual, modernization of the public sector, decentralization, ensuring up-to-date military defense, and an emphasis on protecting Denmark&#x27;s national history and traditions. In foreign policy, the party supports economic cooperation with the European Union to aid Denmark&#x27;s economic growth and keep peace in Europe, but maintains the EU must also respect the right to national identity and calls for a less centralized EU in which member states can maintain sovereignty over their national, regional and local decision making powers. The party also highlights environmentalism as one of its core philosophies in accordance to green conservatism.

== Notable members ==

* John Christmas Møller – World War II resistance figure in exile in England.
* Poul Schlüter – The longest-serving Danish prime minister since Thorvald Stauning. Schlüter is the Conservative People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s only prime minister to date. He led the Conservative People&#x27;s Party to its best-ever result at a national election, reaching 23.4% of the national vote. After his term as prime minister ended he was elected to the European Parliament in 1994, reaching a record breaking number of 247,956 personal votes.
* Connie Hedegaard – Appointed as the European Union&#x27;s first ever European Commissioner for Climate Action in February 2010, Hedegaard was elected to the Danish Parliament as a member for the Conservative People&#x27;s Party in 1984 at the age of 23, becoming the youngest Danish MP ever at that time. In 1989, Hedegaard became first spokesperson for the Conservative People&#x27;s Party, but left politics for journalism in 1990.
* Stefan G. Rasmussen (born 23 July 1947), a former Danish pilot who captained the crash-landing SAS flight 751 on 27 December 1991, in which there were no fatalities. He then entered politics, serving in the Danish &quot;Folketing&quot; from 1994 to 1996.

<doc id="403124" wikidata="Q6394305" url="?curid=403124" title="Kerr-McGee">
<text>The Kerr-McGee Corporation, founded in 1929, was an American energy company involved in oil exploration, production of crude oil, natural gas, perchlorate and uranium mining and milling in various countries. On June 23, 2006, Anadarko Petroleum acquired Kerr-McGee in an all-cash transaction totalling $16.5 billion plus $2.6 billion in debt and all operations moved from their base in Oklahoma, United States. As a result of further acquisitions, most of the former Kerr-McGee is now part of Occidental Petroleum.

==History==
The company later known as Kerr-McGee was founded in 1929 as Anderson &amp; Kerr Drilling Company by Oklahoma businessman-politician Robert S. Kerr (1896-1963) and oil driller James L. Anderson. When Dean A. McGee (1904-1989), a former chief geologist for Phillips Petroleum, joined the firm in 1946, it changed its name to Kerr-McGee Oil Industries, Incorporated. The company initially focused mostly on off-shore oil exploration and production, being one of the first companies to use drillships in the Gulf of Mexico, and later one of the first companies to use a Spar platform in the area.
With the acquisition of the Oryx Energy Company of Dallas, Texas in 1999, Kerr-McGee gained more onshore assets, as well as significant assets in several foreign areas in Algeria and western Kazakhstan. Later acquisitions of HS Resources and Westport Resources Corp. established the base of operations in Denver, Colorado and added large resource areas throughout the Rocky Mountains.

Until 2005, Kerr-McGee had two major divisions: chemical and oil-related. On November 21, 2005, its chemical division, based in Oklahoma City, was sold as an IPO, Tronox, thereby making Oklahoma City home to the administrative side of Kerr-McGee, while exploration and production management was located in Denver and Houston. Through acquisitions, for a time Kerr-McGee marketed products under the Deep Rock, Coast, Power, and Peoples brands in addition to its own. It also marketed Blue Velvet motor oil, a multiviscosity grade with a blue dyed anti-wear additive.

On June 23, 2006, Anadarko Petroleum, based in The Woodlands, Texas, purchased Kerr-McGee in an all-cash transaction totaling $16.5 billion plus the assumption of $2.6 billion in debt. Kerr-McGee shareholders approved the offer on August 10, 2006, and Kerr-McGee ceased to exist independently. All operations with the exception of Tronox which had been spun off in 2005 moved out of Oklahoma. Within a few years, the top positions at Anadarko had been filled by Kerr-McGee employees and many long-time Anadarko employees had left or been removed from the company, making the merger between Anadarko and Kerr-McGee a &quot;wag the dog&quot; transaction.

===&quot;Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Navajo Tribe&quot;===

&quot;Kerr-McGee v. Navajo Tribe&quot;, 471 U.S. 195 (1985), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that an Indian tribe is not required to obtain the approval of the Secretary of the Interior in order to impose taxes on non-tribal persons or entities doing business on a reservation.

In 1978, the Navajo Tribal Council passed two tax ordinances. The first was a tax of 3% on leaseholds (such as mineral rights) and the second was a 5% tax on business activity.

Kerr-McGee held substantial mineral rights on the Navajo Nation and filed a lawsuit in the federal district court seeking an injunction to prohibit the tribe from collecting the tax. Kerr-McGee argued that any tax of non-Indians by a tribe required approval by the Secretary of the Interior and the district court agreed, granting the injunction. The tribe appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit overruled the district court, finding no federal statute or regulation required such approval. Kerr-McGee then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and agreed to hear the case. The court decided unanimously that the Navajo Nation had the right to tax Kerr-McGee because tribal authority to tax had already been recognized, and because no federal law prohibited exercising tribal sovereignty in enacting a tax.

==Locations==

===United States===
Main oil and gas operations in the US were the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountains, onshore Louisiana, and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Main offices were located in downtown Denver and the Greenspoint area of Houston.

Corporate headquarters were located in Downtown Oklahoma City. In the 1970s the company had a forest products division, and mineral mining in New Mexico, Arizona, and Idaho, and coal mining in Wyoming and Illinois. Most of the U.S operations were on land owned by the U.S. government (i.e. Bureau of Land Management, National Forest) and the Navajo Indian tribe. Kerr-McGee owned a potash operation in California from 1974 to 1990.

===Mainland China===
Kerr-McGee had exploration, development, and production projects in Bohai Bay, China, near Beijing. Additional exploration was planned for the South China Sea. These operations were run primarily from an office in Beijing.

===Other locations===
Kerr-McGee and its subsidiaries formerly operated in western Kazakhstan, western Australia, Brazil, Trinidad, Benin, the United Kingdom and several other more minor locations around the world at various times.

==Controversies==

===Exploration in disputed regions of Western Sahara===
Kerr-McGee received international criticism for undertaking exploration for hydrocarbon resources offshore the Moroccan controlled area of the disputed territory of Western Sahara in 2001. In 2003, one of Norway&#x27;s main private investment funds, Skagen Vekst, sold their €3.6 million stake in the oil company, referring to ethical problems surrounding Kerr-McGee&#x27;s engagement in Western Sahara. In May 2005, despite the number of growing protests, the company renewed the contract signed with Moroccan authorities until October. In June 2005, the Norwegian government sold the $52.7 million it had invested in the company through the Government Petroleum Fund (one of the biggest investment funds of the world), characterizing Kerr-McGee&#x27;s contract in Western Sahara as having &quot;particularly serious violations of fundamental ethical norms&quot;. That same month, another two Norwegian private investment funds (Storebrand and KLP) sold their participations on Kerr-McGee, €1 million and €1.45 million respectively. On May 2, 2006, the company declared its intention to no longer drill off the coast of the Western Sahara, by not renewing the contract signed with Morocco.

===Under-payment of royalties to the U.S. government===
On June 14, 2004, Bobby Maxwell, a senior government auditor for the U.S. Department of the Interior&#x27;s Minerals Management Service (&quot;MMS&quot;), filed suit in federal court on behalf of the U.S. Government against Kerr-McGee, under the whistle-blowing provisions of the False Claims Act (&quot;FCA&quot;). In the suit, Mr. Maxwell alleged that, based on the information uncovered during his audit, &quot;Kerr-McGee knowingly made false and/or fraudulent statements on the monthly royalty reports submitted to the MMS and &#x27;understated and underpaid&#x27; its federal royalties.&quot; In January 2007, after a full trial on the issues, Kerr-McGee was found by a jury to have failed to report earnings, and thus, under-paying royalties due to the U.S. government. The jury award damages in the amount of US$7.6 million. Despite the jury&#x27;s verdict, however, before entering judgment, the court reconsidered an earlier Motion for Summary Judgement filed by Kerr-McGee and reversed its prior holding, this time determining that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case at all. The case was appealed by Mr. Maxwell, and on September 10, 2008, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the lower court, remanding it back for further proceedings. On September 16, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Marcia S. Krieger of Colorado ordered Kerr-McGee to pay treble damages, or almost $23 million. As a whistle-blower under the FCA, Mr. Maxwell would be entitled to twenty-five percent of the amount recovered for the government, or approximately $5.7 million. Per Mr. Maxwell, however, most of the money awarded would go to pay the legal fees associated with his almost-10-year fight to force Kerr-McGee to change its deceptive practices and pay what it owed to the public.

===Karen Silkwood===
It is alleged that Karen Silkwood was negligently or purposefully contaminated with plutonium while working at Kerr-McGee&#x27;s Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site and investigating safety violations at the plant. Her activism and November 1974 death were the subject of the 1983 film &quot;Silkwood&quot;. In a civil suit against Kerr-McGee by the Estate of Karen Silkwood, Judge Frank Theis told the jury, &quot;If you find that the damage to the person or property of Karen Silkwood resulted from the operation of this plant, Kerr-McGee is liable.&quot;

The jury rendered its verdict of $505,000 in damages and $10,000,000 in punitive damages. On appeal, the judgment was reduced to $5,000. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court restored the original verdict (&quot;Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.,&quot; 464 U.S. 283 (1984)). The suit was headed for retrial when Kerr-McGee settled out of court in 1986 for $1.38 million, admitting no liability. Gerry Spence, the noted trial lawyer from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, represented the Karen Silkwood estate in this litigation.

==Environmental record==
Kerr-McGee is at least partially responsible for large scale perchlorate water contamination first discovered in the Lower Colorado River in 1997; It stemmed from land used by a facility in Henderson, Nevada which was owned and operated by Kerr-McGee Chemical LLC (as of 2011 Tronox LLC), where perchlorate was produced from 1945 until 1998.

In May 2007, Kerr-McGee Corp spent $18 million on pollution controls in the first comprehensive settlement under the Clean Air Act that reduced harmful emission and conserved natural gas at production facilities across Utah and Colorado. The settlement addressed violations discovered at several of Kerr-McGee&#x27;s natural gas compressor stations located on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation near Vernal, Utah, and in the Denver Julesburg Basin near Weld County, Colorado. In addition to implementing pollution controls, the agreement required Kerr-McGee to pay a $200,000 penalty, and spend $250,000 on environmental projects to benefit the areas in which violations occurred. In July 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) settled with Kerr McGee Chemical in Henderson, Nevada that required the company to pay $55,392 penalty to resolve air permitting violations at its facility that began in 1993. The EPA cited Kerr-McGee for failing to install carbon monoxide emissions controls required under the Clean Air Act when it installed a new open hearth furnace in 1993. The company spent $4.8 million to install proper pollution controls at the facility reducing total carbon monoxide emission by 115 tons per year, an 80% reduction from previous levels.

==Nuclear production==

Kerr-McGee was involved in several nuclear endeavors.

In 1952 Kerr-McGee bought the Navajo Uranium Mining Company, including an interest in a number of mines. It also bought an ore buying station at Shiprock, New Mexico. In 1953 it built a processing plant (called the Shiprock Mill) near the buying station. In 1963 the mines and mill were sold to the Vanadium Corporation of America.

Later a partnership with other companies was formed called the Kermac Nuclear Fuels Corporation. In 1957-58 this partnership built a uranium mill near Grants, New Mexico and Ambrosia Lake. In 1983 the mill was taken over by a new Kerr-McGee subsidiary called the Quivira Mining Corporation. Quivira was sold to Rio Algom in 1989.

Kerr-McGee purchased the Lakeview Mining Company of Lake County, Oregon in 1961. The plant was shut down in late 1960 or 1961 and sold to Atlantic Richfield in 1968.

From about 1962-1966 Kerr-McGee processed uranium at its oil refinery site in Cushing, Oklahoma. It received licenses in 1962 for processing uranium and thorium, and in 1963 for enriched uranium. In 1966 it stopped production. An attempt was made to move all regulated nuclear material to the company&#x27;s new Cimarron facility at Crescent, OK. Cleanups were attempted in 1966, 1972, 1979–82, and the 1990s
In about 1965 Kerr-McGee started producing uranium fuel at its Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site. This was located near the Cimarron River and Crescent, Oklahoma. From 1973 to 1975 it would also produce mixed Plutonium-Uranium Oxide (MOX) &#x27;driver fuel pins&#x27; for use in the Fast Flux Test Facility at the Hanford Site in Washington State. The plant shut down in 1976.

In 1967 Kerr-McGee bought the American Potash and Chemical Company, which owned the Rare Earths Facility in West Chicago, Illinois. This facility produced thorium, radium, and uranium by acid leaching of monazite sands and other ores. It stopped work in 1973.

In 1968 the company started construction on what would become the Sequoyah Fuels Corporation plant in Gore, Oklahoma. In 1970 the plant started turning yellowcake uranium into uranium hexafluoride. In 1987 it began producing depleted uranium tetrafluoride using depleted uranium hexafluoride as input. In 1988 SFC was sold to General Atomics. In late November 1993 production ceased after a stuck valve in the processing plant stuck open and caused an uncontrolled reaction. The uncontrolled reaction resulted in a large visible cloud leaving the plant. Production ceased immediately and the plant operations were suspended to never resume.

===Nuclear corporations, subsidiaries, and spinoffs===

In 1956 Kerr-McGee formed the Kermac Nuclear Fuels Corporation in partnership with Anderson Development Corp, and Pacific Uranium Mines Co. It was active in New Mexico.

Some time in the 1970s, the Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corporation was formed. In 1983 it split into the Quivira Mining Corporation and Sequoyah Fuels Corporation. Quivira got the Ambrosia Lake, NM mine, while Sequoyah Fuels took over the Sequoyah plant in Gore, OK, as well as the Cimarron plant in Crescent, OK. Sequoyah was sold to General Atomics in 1988. and Quivira was sold to Rio Algom in 1989.

The Cimarron Corporation was a subdivision that took control of the Cimarron plant in 1988. When Tronox was spun off in 2006, it would get ownership of Cimarron Corporation and responsibility for the plant as well.

Kerr-McGee bought the American Potash and Chemical Company in 1967, including its Rare Earths Facility that processed uranium and thorium. AMPOT became Kerr-McGee Chemical Company around 1970 or 1974. In 2005 this became Tronox. Tronox became independent in 2006, a few months before Kerr-McGee was sold to Anadarko Petroleum. Tronox later went bankrupt, blaming in part the environmental liabilities inherited from KMC. In 2009 purchasers of Tronox filed a class action lawsuit against Anadarko for having allegedly misled investors.

===Licenses===

<text>The Unionist Democratic Union (; ) is a political party in Tunisia with pan-Arabist ideology. 

==History and profile==
The party was founded on 30 November 1988 when it was recognized by the authorities. Its founder and first secretary-general Abderrahmane Tlili had been a member of the RCD before he founded the UDU in order to gather Arab nationalists, including Baathists and Nasserists, in a party that was close to the government. The party publishes a newspaper, entitled &quot;Al Watan&quot;.

In 1994, the electoral law was changed, ensuring the parliamentary representation of minor parties. The MDS received three of 163 seats (19 being reserved for the opposition). In the 1999 election, the party won seven seats, which it won again in the 2004 election. In 2009, this increased to nine seats.

In the election for the Constituent Assembly after the Tunisian revolution of 2011, the UDU failed to win any seats.

<text>The Battle of Łódź () or Lodz operation (), took place from 11 November to 6 December 1914, near the city of Łódź in Poland. Battles were fought between German units of the Eighth army, Ninth Army, Austrian First Army, and the Russian First, Second, and Fifth Armies, in harsh winter conditions. The Germans redeployed their Ninth Army around Thorn, so as to threaten the Russian northern flank, following German reversals after the Battle of the Vistula River. The German objective was to prevent an invasion of Germany, by encircling and destroying the Russians, as a result, Germans themselves were surrounded and actually lost 2 corps, although the invasion of Germany was prevented Battle had a strong impact on both the Western and Eastern fronts.
It ended with the victory of the Russian troops, although the planned invasion of Germany was canceled.

==Background==
Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich favored Nikolai Ruzsky&#x27;s plan to invade Silesia on 14 November, with the Russian Second, Fifth, and Fourth Armies. The Russian Tenth and First Armies maintained pressure on East Prussia, while the Eighth Army pressed against the Carpathian passes, the Eleventh besieged Przemyśl, and the Third army advanced on Kraków. Hindenburg and Ludendorff had moved the German Ninth Army to the Thorn area, in an attempt to defend Silesia. The Ninth Army consisted of the XI, XVII, and XX Corps, plus the 3rd Guards Infantry Division, and the I Reserve and XXV Reserve Corps from the Eighth Army. Four divisions of the Austro-Hungarian Second Army took over the German Ninth Army&#x27;s former positions, the remainder of Second Army troops then came under the command of the Austro-Hungarian Third army. The Germans had placed 15 infantry divisions, and 5 cavalry divisions, under Mackensen&#x27;s Ninth Army in its drive on Łódź. However, the German advance faced 24 Russian infantry divisions and 8 cavalry divisions. The Scheidemann&#x27;s Russian Second army was deployed around Łódź, with his IV, I and XXIII Corps on the Warta, and his II Corps at Łęczyca. Rennenkampf&#x27;s Russian First Army was deployed further east, along the Vistula.

On 1 November, Paul von Hindenburg was appointed commander of the two German armies on the Eastern Front. His Eighth Army was defending East Prussia. Knowing Silesia would be invaded on 14 November, Hindenburg and Ludendorff decided not to meet the attack head-on, but to seize the initiative by shifting their Ninth Army north by railway to the border south of the German fortress at Thorn, where they were reinforced with two corps transferred from Eighth Army. The enlarged Ninth Army would then attack the Russian right flank, cutting Łódź off from Warsaw, and eliminating any troops thus encircled. In ten days Ninth Army was moved north by running 80 trains every day.

==Battle==
On 11 November, Mackensen&#x27;s German Ninth Army I and XXV Reserve Corps struck at the V Siberia Corps of Rennenkampf&#x27;s First Army, located near Włocławek on the left bank of the Vistula, before they could prepare defensive positions. The German XX Corps advanced on Lubraniec so as to attack the V Siberian Corps flank. Rennenkampf was refused permission to send his VI Siberian Corps from Wyszogród to the aid of the V Siberian Corps, who had to retreat. On 12 November, a gap formed between the Russian II and V Siberian Corps, as the V Siberian Corps was forced to retreat to the southeast, which Mackensen took advantage of on 13 November. On 14 November, Mackensen ordered his entire German Ninth Army to advance, with his XI Corps attacking the Russian XXIII Corps northern flank, his XVII and XX Corps engaging the Russian II Corps, and his I Reserve Corps was to capture Łowicz, while containing the VI Siberian Corps. Yet, the Russians were still unaware of the German force attacking them, as they started their invasion of Silesia. On 15 November, the Germans captured Kutno, and on 16 November, crossed the Bzura, while Scheidemann ordered his Russian I and IV Corps to retreat towards Łódź. As the German XX Corps captured Stryków, the XXV Reserve Corps captured Brzeziny on 18 November, while XX and XVII engaged the defenses of Łódź. The Russian Fifth Army&#x27;s XIX and V Corps were ordered north to Skierniewice, in support of Second Army&#x27;s left flank. It was Plehve&#x27;s Russian Fifth Army which prevented German encirclement of Łódź from the south. In the interim, Rennenkampf&#x27;s Russian First Army remained stationary, content to guard the approach to Warsaw.

Grand Duke Nicholas&#x27;s primary objective was saving Second Army and avoiding a repeat of the disaster at Tannenberg. On 16 November he ordered Wenzel von Plehve&#x27;s Russian Fifth Army to abandon the proposed offensive into Silesia and to move northward towards Łódź; they marched in only two days. As soon as Hindenburg saw the transcript of this order, he knew that his maneuver had succeeded. Now seven Russian corps were defending the city. Plehve smashed into Mackensen&#x27;s right flank on 18 November in bitter winter conditions (at times the temperature dropped as low as .

By 19 November, the Germans were facing a numerically superior Russian force, with the intention of the Russians to attack the German penetration east of Łódź on 21 November. Yet, Mackensen still ordered his XX and XXV Reserve Corps to continue their effort to outflank the Russian Łódź defenses. The Germans made little progress on 20 November. On 21 November, a group commanded by Vladimir Slyusarenko in Rennenkampf&#x27;s Russian First Army, advanced from Łowicz towards Bielawy and Strykow, in an attempt to close the gap between the Russian First and Second Armies. Slyusarenko&#x27;s force consisted of the 43rd Infantry Division, the 6th Siberian Infantry Division, and 3 additional brigades. Only the German 19th Dragoon Regiment opposed this Russian threat to Friedrich von Scholtz&#x27;s XX Corps rear, whose front faced southwest, south, and east.

The German Ninth Army&#x27;s right wing was XXV Reserve Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Reinhard von Scheffer-Boyadel, a 63-year-old who had been recalled from retirement. With Lieutenant General Manfred von Richthofen&#x27;s, great uncle of the flying ace, cavalry in the van, they were pushing southeast between Łódź and the Vistula. Part of Rennenkampf&#x27;s First Army was finally moving east to attack the Germans. Their repositioning was hindered when a makeshift bridge across the river collapsed, so they had to cross by ferry or on the nearest usable crossing upstream. Once over they attacked the weakly defended side of the corridor extending south from the German frontier to their advancing spearhead. The Russians reoccupied Brzeziny, cutting the roads used by German XXV Reserve Corps, whose progress south was now blocked by the Russian Fifth Army. Scheffer was ordered to stop advancing, but the order did not reach him. Suddenly it was the Germans who were ensnared in a pocket. Mackensen stopped attacking toward Łódź, turning to help to extricate them. The ecstatic Russians ordered trains for up to 20,000 prisoners, actually the German fighting strength in the pocket was about 11,000, but there were also 3,000 wounded. Other sources state that 50,000 prisoners were anticipated.

Hindenburg was alarmed by the intercepted wireless messages ordering the trains, but Mackensen assured him that they would prevail. In the pocket, Richthofen&#x27;s cavalry, which had been leading the advance, reversed direction to screen the rear of three infantry columns Scheffer formed along the roads for the retreat back northwest. The frozen, hungry Germans pushed on through the icy night. They reached the outskirts of Breziny unobserved, because most of the 6th Siberian Division were huddling in their sleeping quarters, trying to keep from freezing. The Germans attacked at dawn with bayonets on unloaded rifles and occupied much of the town before a shot was fired. The commander of 6th Siberian Division, Gennings, broke down. Swamped with conflicting accounts of German movements, and with the weather too foggy and the days too short for aerial observation, Ruzsky issued a series of orders, each contradicting the one before.

Scheffer&#x27;s left column, led by Karl Litzmann&#x27;s 3rd Guards Infantry Division, had reached Breziny on the morning of 24 November. Litzmann wrote, on the retreat through Gałków Mały beforehand, &quot;...the sleeping Russians were hauled out of the houses and taken prisoner.&quot; Litzmann led the &quot;overwhelming and sudden&quot; attack on Breziny, of which, &quot;The success reinvigorated us,&quot; he later wrote. According to Buttar, &quot;The confusion in command was widespread throughout the Russian formations involved in the fighting. It seems that the moves by Mackensen to aid the breakout by directing elements of XX Corps and I Reserve Corps to attack the encircling Russians distracted many local commanders, who directed their troops into positions from where they could cover any new German advance from the north, rather than a breakout from the encirclement.&quot; Scheffer&#x27;s central column was led by Thiesenhausen&#x27;s 49th Reserve Division messaged Scheffer, &quot;There is no doubt: if we don&#x27;t get through today, we will all be left lying on this ground, or will be en route for Siberia.&quot; By the end of the day, all three of Scheffer&#x27;s columns were united in Brzeziny, including the right column consisting of Hans von der Goltz&#x27;s 50th Reserve Division. In the words of Buttar, &quot;It was the end of the encirclement of Scheffer&#x27;s command.&quot;

Scheffer&#x27;s XXV Reserve Corps was able to link up with the German XX Corps, when the Alexei Churin&#x27;s Russian II Corps abandoned Strykow. Scheffer&#x27;s men had escaped with their wounded, 12,000 Russian prisoners, and 64 captured Russian guns.

Inconclusive fighting continued until 29 November when at a conference with his front commanders Grand Duke Nicholas ordered his forces in Poland to withdraw to defensible lines nearer to Warsaw.
Hindenburg learned from an intercepted wireless that Łódź was to be evacuated.
===Casualties===
The battle became one of the bloodiest on the eastern front, the Russian troops won, but paid a heavy price. The most minimal estimates of losses of Russian troops start from 110,000. Russian authors Alexei Oleynikov and Sergey Nelipovich, however, raise Russian losses to about 300,000. The former estimate Russian losses at 280,000, which made up the majority of the grouping. The second one brings the bar to 316,478 total losses, of which 25,000 were killed, 116,000 were injured, and 172,000 were missing. The losses of the central Powers are estimated in approximately the same range. Nelipovich shows that of the 9th Army, losses amounted to 124,629, of which 25,000 also died. Oleynikov estimates the losses of the 9th army in the same way, but adds that according to the report to the German headquarters near Lodz, over 36,000 people were only buried, and in addition to the troops of the 9th army, other units suffered heavy losses, as a result, he brings the total losses to 160,000.

==Aftermath==
Mackensen, Scheffer and Litzmann were awarded the Pour le Mérite, while Litzmann earned the nickname &#x27;the Lion of Brzeziny&#x27;. According to Buttar, &quot;The encirclement of XXV Reserve Corps was broken for several reasons: lack of coordination by First, Second, and Fifth Armies; the extraordinary muddle of command in the Lowicz detachment; and Ruzsky&#x27;s oscillation between his deep-rooted caution and his almost impulsive issuing of orders for all-out attacks.&quot; For the Russian Army, Łódź became the furthest point of advance towards Germany&#x27;s heartland. Ruzsky retreated to a defensive line along the Bzura and Rawka rivers.

The Russians were able to avoid a full cauldron in a semi-circle and repel all attacks of their enemy, thereby avoiding a new Tannenberg. This meant that the Germans&#x27; encirclement plans were thwarted and the battle ended in a tactical victory for the Russians. The Germans themselves, e.g., Max Hoffmann and Ludendorff, admitted that the battle was not successful for them in terms of achieving operational and tactical objectives.

Hindenburg summed it up: &quot;In its rapid changes from attack to defense, enveloping to being enveloped, breaking through to being broken through, this struggle reveals a most confusing picture on both sides. A picture which in its mounting ferocity exceeded all the battles that had previously been fought on the Eastern front!&quot; The Polish winter bought a lull to the major fighting. A Russian invasion of Silesia must wait for spring. By this time, the Russians feared the German army, which seemed to appear from nowhere and to win a strategic victory despite substantial odds against them, while the Germans regarded the Russian army with &quot;increasing disdain.&quot; Hindenburg and Ludendorff were convinced that if sufficient troops were transferred from the Western Front, they could force the Russians out of the war.

Thus, the battle turned out to be a kind of &quot;Tannenberg on the contrary&quot;. If the East Prussian operation is a vivid example of a brilliant tactical victory and a strategic unsuccess for the Germans (as they moved from the west the needed troops in the form of 2 corps and 1 cavalry division that could be useful at the First Battle of the Marne), then the opposite is true with the Łódź operation. Technically, Łódź was a victory for Russia, but the Germans achieved their aim, and after the Russian withdrawal, Russia never came so close to German soil.

<text>The Popular Unity Party (; , PUP) is an Arab nationalist party in Tunisia.

==History and profile==
The party was founded in 1981 as a breakaway from the left-wing Popular Unity Movement (MUP) by members who disagreed with MUP leader Ahmed Ben Salah&#x27;s policy to boycott elections. In 1983, the government of Mohammed Mzali legalised two moderate oppositional parties, including the PUP.

The party won two seats in the general election held on 20 March 1994.

Following the elections of 1999, the PUP had seven members in the Tunisian parliament. At the 2004 legislative elections, the party won 3.6% of the popular vote and 11 out of 189 seats. The same day, its candidate , won 3.8% at the presidential elections. In 2006, the PUP tried to form an alliance with three other minor oppositional parties, the Social Liberal Party (PSL), the Unionist Democratic Union (UDU) and the Green Party for Progress (PVP). However, the alliance quickly collapsed when some of the participants were accused of pursuing particular interests rather than unity of the opposition. At the 2009 legislative elections, the PUP won 3.4% of the popular vote and 12 out of 214 seats.

After the Tunisian revolution of 2011, the PUP participated in elections for the Constituent Assembly, but failed to win any seats.

The party has published a weekly newspaper under the title of &quot;Al Wahada&quot;.

<doc id="403130" wikidata="Q77095" url="?curid=403130" title="Herbert Wehner">
<text>Herbert Richard Wehner (11 July 1906 – 19 January 1990) was a German politician. A former member of the Communist Party, he joined the Social Democrats (SPD) after World War II. He served as Federal Minister of Intra-German Relations from 1966 to 1969 and thereafter as chairman of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag until 1983.

During his tenure in the Bundestag from 1949 to 1983, Wehner became (in-)famous for his caustic rhetoric and heckling style, often hurling personal insults at MPs with whom he disagreed. He holds the record for official censures (77 by one count, 78 or 79 by others) handed down by the presiding officer.

==Life==
Herbert Wehner was born in Dresden, the son of a shoemaker. His father was active in his trade union and a member of the Social Democratic Party. More radical than his father, Wehner engaged in anarcho-syndicalist circles around Erich Mühsam, driven by the 1923 invasion of Reichswehr troops into the Free State of Saxony at the behest of the DVP–SPD Reich government of Chancellor Gustav Stresemann. He also fell out with Mühsam, whose pacifist manners he rejected and was accused of stealing money by him, which Wehner never denied.
He finally joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1927, becoming an official of the party&#x27;s &quot;Rote Hilfe&quot; organisation the same year.

Wehner rose quickly and was elected to the &quot;Landtag&quot; state legislature of Saxony in 1930. Nevertheless, he resigned one year later to work at the KPD politburo in Berlin with Walter Ulbricht. After Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power in January 1933, he participated in the communist resistance against the Nazi regime from the Saar Protectorate. When the Saar was re-incorporated in 1935, Wehner went into exile, first to Paris, then in 1937 to Moscow, where he lived at Hotel Lux, wrote for the &quot;Deutsche Zentral-Zeitung&quot; and had to face Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge of 1937–38. After Wehner&#x27;s death, German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; documented accusations that he informed the NKVD on several party fellows like Hugo Eberlein, presumably to save his own life. After being sent to neutral Sweden in 1941 in order to re-enter Germany, he was arrested at Stockholm and interned for espionage in 1942. Whether he deliberately went into custody has not been conclusively established; at least he was excluded from the Communist Party by politburo chief Wilhelm Pieck.

Upon his return to Germany in 1946, Wehner joined the Social Democratic Party in Hamburg and soon became an aide of Chairman Kurt Schumacher. After the 1949 federal election he entered the Bundestag parliament and remained an MP until his retirement from politics in 1983, from 1952 to 1958 also as a member of the European Parliament. In 1957/58 and again from 1964 to 1966, he served as deputy chairman of the SPD parliamentary group. Wehner was instrumental in the party&#x27;s adoption of the Godesberg Program in which the Social Democrats repudiated a fixation on Marxist ideology and broadened its appeal. In 1966, he was named Federal Minister for All-German Affairs in the CDU–SPD grand coalition government of Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger. The cooperation between the ex-communist and the former member of the Nazi Party went well; Wehner even promised the CDU partners to stabilize the coalition by backing the implementation of a plurality voting system, which he later denoted as &quot;nonsense&quot;.

When the SPD assumed the reins of government under Chancellor Willy Brandt upon the 1969 federal election, Wehner became chairman of the SPD parliamentary faction. He was known as a hard disciplinarian who kept his members in line. When the CDU on 27 April 1972 waged a constructive vote of no confidence against Brandt, he ordered the SPD deputies not to participate in the ballot in order to exclude possible bribed dissidents. The opposing candidate Rainer Barzel failed to reach the absolute majority by two votes. After Brandt was re-elected in 1972, the relations between the two men cooled down during the 1973 oil crisis, when Wehner increasingly viewed the chancellor&#x27;s policies as indecisive. In the course of the Guillaume Affair, he did not make great efforts to persuade Brandt to stay in office and promoted the chancellorship of Helmut Schmidt.

Already Father of the House from 1980, Wehner did not seek re-election in 1983, after the social-liberal coalition had finally broken up. He retired to Bonn, where he died in 1990 at the age of 83 after a long illness, suffering from Diabetes mellitus and Binswanger&#x27;s disease.

==Rhetoric==
Wehner held an infamous reputation among members of the Bundestag (and the public) for his sharp, and often insulting, rhetoric towards MPs that disagreed with him. 
His remarks about political opponents often revolved around insulting word plays with their respective last names. One notable exception is his pejorative neologism &quot;Düffeldoffel&quot; which he used to insult Helmut Kohl. His sharp comments would not stop at his own party either: When the SPD-MP Franz Josef Zebisch complained about how the alphabetic seating order in the Bundestag in the 1960s left him at the back of the room, Wehner told him to just rename himself to “Comrade Asshole”.

German media occasionally depicts Wehner and CSU-politician Franz Josef Strauß to have been political rivals as both had highly influential yet never the highest positions within their respective parties and Strauß was also known for a fierce albeit less personally insulting rhetoric.

Wehner&#x27;s reception across the aisle among CDU/CSU politicians was mostly negative due to his rhetoric. However, CDU politician Heiner Geißler acknowledged Wehner&#x27;s uncompromising style of standing up for his party&#x27;s positions as &quot;the biggest parliamentary howitzer of all time&quot;.

<text>The Social Democrats (, , , S) is a social democratic political party in Denmark. A member of the Party of European Socialists, the Social Democrats have 50 out of 179 members of the Danish parliament (following the latest Danish general election held in 2022), Folketing, and three out of fourteen MEPs elected from Denmark.

Founded by Louis Pio in 1871, the party first entered the Folketing in the 1884 Danish Folketing election. By the early 20th century, it had become the party with the largest representation in the Folketing, a distinction it would hold for 77 years. It first formed a government after the 1924 Danish Folketing election under Thorvald Stauning, the longest-serving Danish Prime Minister of the 20th century. During Stauning&#x27;s government which lasted until the 1926 Danish Folketing election, the Social Democrats exerted a profound influence on Danish society, laying the foundation of the Danish welfare state. From 2002 to 2016, the party used the name &quot;Socialdemokraterne&quot; in some contexts. The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International from 1923 to 1940. A member of the Socialist International until 2017, the party withdrew to join the Progressive Alliance, founded in 2013.

The party was the major coalition partner in government from the 2011 Danish general election until the 2015 Danish general election, with then-party leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt as Prime Minister. After losing power in the 2015 election, Thorning-Schmidt was succeeded as party leader on 28 June 2015 by the former Vice Leader Mette Frederiksen, who shifted the party back to the political left on economics, while criticising mass immigration. Frederiksen led the party to win the 2019 and 2022 Danish general election, forming a single-party minority government from 2019 to 2022 and a majority grand-coalition government with the centre-right Venstre and the centrist Moderates since 2022.

== Overview ==
The party traces its own history back to the International Labour Association, founded in 1871 and banned in 1873, loosely re-organised in the Social Democratic Labour Party which in 1876 issued the Gimle program, but as a formal political party it was first founded from 11–12 February 1878 as the Social Democratic Federation. This name was formally carried by the party for almost a hundred years, although in practice it also used a number of other names until it changed its name to Social Democracy in 1965. At a congress in Aalborg in 2002, the party changed its name to the Social Democrats, but from 2016 again only Social Democracy is used.

The party has the letter &quot;A&quot; as a symbol, but the abbreviation &quot;S&quot; is often used in the media. The party&#x27;s classic symbol is a red rose and in recent times an &quot;A&quot; in a red circle. Aside from the classical socialist red colour, the party has recently adopted a more light red colour called competition orange.

The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940. It is now a member of the Progressive Alliance, an association of progressive social-democratic parties. The Social Democrats are also a member of the Party of European Socialists while the party&#x27;s MEPs sit in the Socialists &amp; Democrats group.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===

The party was founded as the International Labour Association of Denmark on 15 October 1871 by Louis Pio, Harald Brix and Paul Geleff. The goal was to organise the emerging working class on a democratic and socialist basis. The industrialisation of Denmark had begun in the mid-19th century and a period of rapid urbanisation had led to an emerging class of urban workers. The social-democratic movement emerged from the desire to give this group political rights and representation in the Folketing, the Danish parliament. In 1876, the party held an annual conference, adopting the first party manifesto.

The stated policy was as follows: 

In 1884, the party had their first two members of parliament elected, namely Peter Thygesen Holm and Chresten Hørdum.

=== 20th century ===

In 1906, the party created the Social Democratic Youth Association, lasting until 1920 when the Social Democratic Youth of Denmark and current party&#x27;s youth wing was founded.

In the 1924 Danish Folketing election, the party won the majority with 36.6 percent of the vote and its first government was put in place with Thorvald Stauning as Prime Minister. That same year, he appointed Nina Bang as the world&#x27;s first female minister, nine years after women&#x27;s suffrage had been given in Denmark. Stauning stayed in power until his death in 1942, with his party laying the foundations for the Danish welfare state based on a close collaboration between labor unions and the government.

In January 1933, Stauning&#x27;s government entered into what was then the most extensive settlement yet in Danish politics, namely the Kanslergade settlement () with the liberal party Venstre. The settlement was named after Stauning&#x27;s apartment in Kanslergade in Copenhagen and included extensive agricultural subsidies and reforms of the legislation and administration in the social sector. In 1935, Stauning was reelected with the famous slogan &quot;Stauning or Chaos&quot;.

Stauning&#x27;s second cabinet lasted until the Nazi occupation of Denmark in 1940, when the cabinet was widened to include all political parties for a national unity government and the Danish government pursued a collaborative policy with the German occupiers. Through the 1940s and until 1972, most of Denmark&#x27;s Prime Ministers were from the party.

=== Poul Nyrup Rasmussen government coalition: 1993–2001 ===

The Social Democrats&#x27; social policy through the 1990s and continuing in the 21st century involved a significant redistribution of income and the maintenance of a large state apparatus with collectively financed core public services such as public healthcare, education and infrastructure.

Social Democrats-led coalition governments (the I, II, III and IV Cabinets of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen) implemented the system known as flexicurity (flexibility and social security), mixing strong Scandinavian unemployment benefits with deregulated employment laws, making it easier for employers to fire and rehire people in order to encourage economic growth and reduce unemployment.

The Cabinets of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen maintained a parliamentary majority during the period from 1993 to 2001 by virtue of their support from the Socialist People&#x27;s Party and the Red–Green Alliance.

Towards the end of the 1990s, a trade surplus of 30 billion kroner (US$4.9 billion) turned into a deficit. To combat this, the government increased taxes, limiting private consumption. The 1998 initiative, dubbed the Whitsun Packet (Danish: &quot;Pinsepakken&quot;) from the season it was issued, was not universally popular with the electorate; it may have also been a factor in the Social Democrats&#x27; defeat in the 2001 Danish general election.

=== In opposition: 2001–2011 ===
After being defeated by the Liberal Party in the 2001 Danish general election, the party chairmanship went to former finance and foreign minister Mogens Lykketoft. Following another defeat in the 2005 Danish general election, Lykketoft announced his resignation as party leader and at an extraordinary congress on 12 March it was decided that all members of the party would cast votes in an election of a new party leader. The two contenders for the leadership represented the two wings in the party, with Helle Thorning-Schmidt being viewed as centrist and Frank Jensen being viewed as slightly more left-leaning. On 12 April 2005, Thorning-Schmidt was elected as the new leader.

=== Helle Thorning-Schmidt government coalition: 2011–2015 ===
In the 2011 Danish general election, the Social Democrats gained 44 seats in parliament, the lowest number since 1953. Nonetheless, the party succeeded in establishing a minority government with the Danish Social Liberal Party and the Socialist People&#x27;s Party. The incumbent centre-right coalition led by the Liberal Party lost power to a centre-left coalition led by the Social Democrats, making Thorning-Schmidt the country&#x27;s first female prime minister. The Danish Social Liberal Party and the Socialist People&#x27;s Party became part of the three-party centre-left coalition government. The new parliament convened on 4 October. The government rolled back anti-immigration legislation enacted by the previous government and passed a tax-reform with support from the liberal-conservative opposition. The tax reform raised the top tax threshold, which had previously applied to over half the working population. The aim of the tax reform was to increase labour output to fend off a projected labour shortage within the next decades. The stated goal was to entice Danes to work more in order to compensate for the decreasing workforce by lowering tax on wages and gradually lowering welfare payments to those outside of the labour market to increase the economic benefit of working relative to receiving welfare.

On 3 February 2014, the Socialist People&#x27;s Party left the government in protest over the sale of shares in the public energy company DONG Energy to the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Because of the government&#x27;s minority status and of its dependency on the support of the Danish Social Liberal Party, the government had to jettison many of the policies that the Social Democrats–Socialist People&#x27;s Party coalition had given during the campaign. Although critics have accused the government of breaking its promises, other studies argue that it accomplished half of its stated goals, blaming instead poor public relations strategies for its increasingly negative public image. The government pursued a centrist compromise agenda, building several reforms with support from both sides of the parliament. This caused friction with the supporting Red–Green Alliance, who were kept outside of influencing decisions.

=== In opposition: 2015–2019 ===
In the 2015 Danish general election, the Social Democrats gained seats and became the biggest party in the parliament again since 2001, yet lost the government because the right-wing parties had a majority. The results of the 2015 election and the defeat of the left-bloc led Thorning-Schmidt to resign as prime minister on election night and making way for the next leader Mette Frederiksen. Under Frederiksen, the Social Democrats voted in favor of a law allowing Danish authorities to confiscate money, jewellery and other valuable items refugees crossing the border may have as long as those valuables have no sentimental value, despite harsh condemnation from the United Nations Human Right Council and widespread comparisons between the plan and the treatment of Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. The law had been used 17 times in the first six years.

Similarly, the Social Democrats voted for a law banning wearing of burqas and niqabs, while abstaining during a vote on a law on mandatory handshakes irrespective of religious sentiment at citizenship ceremonies and on a plan to house criminal asylum seekers on an island used for researching contagious animal diseases. Frederiksen has also backed the right-wing populist Danish People&#x27;s Party in their paradigm shift push to make repatriation rather than social integration the goal of asylum policy. She has called for a cap on non-Western immigrants, expulsion of asylum seekers to a reception centre in North Africa and forced labour for immigrants in exchange for benefits. Labeling foreign policies of Europe as too economic liberal, Frederiksen has criticised other social democratic parties for losing their voters&#x27; trust by failing to prevent globalisation chipping away at labour rights, increasing inequality and exposing them to uncontrolled immigration.

=== 2019–present: Frederiksen I and II ===
In the 2019 Danish general election, the Social Democrats gained one further seat and the opposition red bloc of left-wing and centre-left parties (the Social Democrats, the Danish Social Liberal Party, the Socialist People&#x27;s Party and the Red–Green Alliance along with the Faroese Social Democratic Party and Greenland&#x27;s Inuit Ataqatigiit and Siumut) won a majority of 93 out of 179 seats in the Folketing while support for the Danish People&#x27;s Party and the Liberal Alliance collapsed, costing Lars Løkke Rasmussen his majority. With the result beyond doubt on election night, Rasmussen conceded defeat and Frederiksen has been commissioned by Queen Margrethe II to lead the negotiations to form a new government.

On 27 June 2019, Frederiksen was successful in forming the Frederiksen Cabinet, an exclusively Social Democrats minority government supported by the red bloc, becoming the second woman in the role after Thorning-Schmidt as well as the youngest prime minister in Danish history at the age of 41. Despite having run on an anti-immigration stance during the election, Frederiksen shifted her stance on immigration by allowing more foreign labour and reversing government plans to hold foreign criminals offshore after winning government.

== Platform ==
Since its foundation, the motto of the party has been &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity&quot; and these values are still described as central in the party program. In the political program, these values are described as being consistent with a focus on solidarity with the poorest and social welfare to those who need it, with individual responsibility in relation to other members in society and with an increased involvement in the European Union project.

As well as adopting more left-leaning economics, the party has become increasingly sceptical of mass immigration from a left-wing perspective in the late 2010s. The party believes that immigration has had negative impacts for much of the population, a more pressing issue since at least 2001 after the 11 September attacks which intensified during the 2015 European migrant crisis. It also returned to a more sceptical view of economic liberalism, even claiming that its adherence to Third Way politics and its application of centrist, neoliberal economics, as well as supporting supporting unrestricted economic globalisation contributed to its poor electoral performance in the late 2000s and early 2010s. In a biography written before becoming the prime minister in 2019, Mette Frederiksen wrote: &quot;For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes.&quot;

The party had factions that promoted anti-immigration policies since the 1980s, but it was Mette Frederiksen that completed the party&#x27;s right-turn on immigration. Since then, Social Democrats have been supporting strict controls of immigration, arguing that it is integral to &quot;a new class struggle&quot; as it protects the national culture, rural communities and the working-class identities of Denmark. The party&#x27;s proposals include expulsion of asylum seekers, a cap on non-Western immigration, and a requirement for immigrants to work at least 37 hours per week before being given a right to social and welfare benefits. Social Democrats also adopted a more conservative stance on cultural diversity, supporting repatriation rather than integration, postulating a ban on burqas and niqabs, and voting in favour of a law allowing Danish authorities to confiscate valuable items from refugees crossing the border. 

Since then, the party is described as a &quot;left conservative&quot; social democratic party, as it &quot;places itself to the left on issues related to welfare and redistribution, and right on cultural and value‐related issues&quot;. It has also been described as welfare chauvinist, and nativist.

== Political leadership ==
The current Party Leader is Mette Frederiksen. She succeeded Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who stepped down after the left bloc&#x27;s defeat in the 2015 Danish general election. Deputy Party Leaders are Lennart Damsbo-Andersen and Christian Rabjerg Madsen. The Secretary General is Annette Lind.

== Election results ==
The Social Democrats governed Denmark for most of the 20th century, with a few intermissions such as the Conservative People&#x27;s Party-led government of Poul Schlüter in the 1980s. It continued to be Denmark&#x27;s largest party until 2001 when Anders Fogh Rasmussen&#x27;s liberal Venstre party gained a landslide victory, becoming the largest party and forming a centre-right government. From 2015 and onwards, The Social Democrats have again been the largest party in Denmark. The Social Democrats returned to government from 2011 to 2015 and since 2019.

<text>Lewis Howard Latimer (September 4, 1848 – December 11, 1928) was an American inventor and patent draftsman. His inventions included an evaporative air conditioner, an improved process for manufacturing carbon filaments for electric light bulbs, and an improved toilet system for railroad cars. In 1884, he joined the Edison Electric Light Company where he worked as a draftsman. The Lewis H. Latimer House, his landmarked former residence, is located near the Latimer Projects at 34–41 137th Street in Flushing, Queens, New York City.

== Early life and family ==

Lewis Howard Latimer was born in  Chelsea, Massachusetts, on September 4, 1848, the youngest of the four children of Rebecca Latimer and George Latimer. Before Lewis was born, his mother and father escaped from slavery in Virginia and fled to Chelsea on October 4, 1842. The day they arrived in Boston, George was recognized by a colleague of his former slave owner and was arrested a few days later, on October 20, 1842. George&#x27;s trial received great notoriety; he was represented by Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison. He was eventually able to purchase his freedom and live with his family in Chelsea.

When Latimer was young he spent time helping his father in his barbershop. Lewis Latimer also spent time at night hanging wallpaper with his father.

When Latimer was 10, his mother decided to split the family after the Dred Scott case ruled individual slaves needed to prove they had the consent of their owner to legally become free; prior to this ruling, many slaves had attained freedom by escaping into free states and becoming state citizens, which gave them some protection from the efforts of interstate slave catchers. Lewis&#x27;s father, George Latimer, had no proof of his emancipation and likely fled to protect his family.

After his father had to flee and his mother had to split the family, Lewis and his brothers were sent to a farm school, and his sisters were sent to stay with a family friend.

Lewis Howard Latimer joined the U.S. Navy at the age of 16 on September 16, 1864, and served as a Landsman on the USS &quot;Massasoit&quot;. After receiving an honorable discharge from the U.S. Navy on July 3, 1865, he gained employment as an office boy with a patent law firm, &quot;Crosby Halstead and Gould&quot;, with a $3.00 per week salary. He learned how to use a set square, ruler, and other drafting tools. Later, after his boss recognized his talent for sketching patent drawings, Latimer was promoted to the position of head draftsman earning $20.00 a week by 1872 ($438.59 today).

Lewis H. Latimer married Mary Wilson Lewis on November 15, 1873, in Fall River, Massachusetts. Mary was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the daughter of Louisa M. and William Lewis. The couple had two daughters, Emma Jeanette (1883–1978) and Louise Rebecca (1890–1963). Jeanette married Gerald Fitzherbert Norman, the first black person hired as a high school teacher in the New York City public school system, and had two children: Winifred Latimer Norman (1914–2014), a social worker who served as the guardian of her grandfather&#x27;s legacy, and Gerald Latimer Norman (1911–1990), who became an administrative law judge.

In 1879, Latimer and his wife, Mary, moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut, along with his mother, Rebecca, and his brother, William. They settled in a neighborhood called &quot;Little Liberia,&quot; which had been established in the early 19th century by free blacks. (The landmark Mary and Eliza Freeman Houses are the last surviving buildings on their original foundations of this community.) Other family members already living there were his brother, George A. Latimer, his wife, Jane, his sister, Margaret, and her husband, Augustus T. Hawley, and their children. Mary died in Bridgeport in 1924.

== Career ==

=== Inventions and technical work ===
In 1874, Latimer co-patented (with Charles M. Brown) an improved toilet system for railroad cars called the Water Closet for Railroad Cars (U.S. Patent 147,363).

In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell employed Latimer, then a draftsman at Bell&#x27;s patent law firm, to draft the necessary drawings required to receive a patent for Bell&#x27;s telephone.

In 1879, he moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and was hired as assistant manager and draftsman for the US Electric Lighting Co., a company owned by Hiram Maxim, a rival of Thomas Edison. While Latimer was there he invented a modification to the process for making carbon filaments which aimed to reduce breakages during the carbonization process. This modification consisted of placing filament blanks inside a cardboard envelope during carbonization. While in England on behalf of the Maxim light company, he taught the entire process for making Maxim lights, including glassblowing, in 9 months to get the factory up and running.

In 1884, he was invited to work with Thomas Edison. Along with the work he did with Edison, he was also responsible for translating data into German and French, as well as gathering that information.

Latimer also developed a forerunner of the air conditioner called &quot;Apparatus for cooling and disinfecting&quot;.

In 1894, Latimer pursued a patent on a safety elevator that prevented the riders from falling out and into the shaft.

In 1924, after the Board of Patent Control dissolved, Latimer went on to work with Hammer and Schwartz until he retired.

=== Edison Pioneers ===
On February 11, 1918, Latimer joined the Edison Pioneers, becoming the first person of color to join this group of 100.

=== Light bulb ===

Latimer received a patent on September 13, 1881, along with Joseph V. Nichols, for a method of attaching carbon filaments to conducting wires within an electric lamp, and another patent on January 17, 1882, for a &quot;process of manufacturing carbons&quot;, a method for the production of carbon filaments for light bulbs which reduced breakages during the production process by wrapping the filaments in a cardboard envelope.

The Edison Electric Light Company in New York City hired Latimer in 1884 as a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights. While at Edison, Latimer wrote the first book on electric lighting, entitled &quot;Incandescent Electric Lighting&quot; (1890), and supervised the installation of public electric lights throughout New York, Philadelphia, Montreal, and London.

When that company was combined in 1892 with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, he continued to work in the legal department.

In 1911, he became a patent consultant to law firms.

=== Teaching ===
Latimer taught English and drafting courses to immigrants at the Henry Street Settlement in New York.

=== Other activities ===

Latimer played the violin and flute, painted portraits, and wrote plays.

He was an early advocate of civil rights. In 1895 Lewis wrote a statement in connection with the National Conference of Colored Men about equality, security, and opportunity.

In later life, even though Latimer was no longer active military, he remained patriotic. He was an early and active member of the veteran organization, Grand Army of the Republic. He acted as secretary and adjutant.

== Death and legacy ==
For 25 years, from 1903 until he died in 1928, Latimer lived with his family in a home on Holly Avenue in what is known now as the East Flushing section of Queens, New York. Latimer died on December 11, 1928, at the age of 80. Approximately sixty years after his death, his home was moved from Holly Avenue to 137th Street in Flushing, Queens, which is about 1.4 miles northwest of its original location.

<text>The Ettajdid Movement (&quot;Movement for Renewal&quot; ; , &#x27; ; ), also referred to simply asEttajdid, was a centre-left secularist political party in Tunisia, active from 1993 to 2012.

==History and profile==
Ettajdid evolved out of the old Tunisian Communist Party, when it abandoned its former ideology in 1993. During the Ben Ali rule, it was one of the legal, although oppressed opposition parties. After the Tunisian revolution of 2011, it became part of the Democratic Modernist Pole alliance and in 2012 it merged into the Social Democratic Path. It was led by its First Secretary Mohamed Harmel from its creation until 2007 and then by Ahmed Brahim until its dissolution.

Adopting its new name and abandoning communism in April 1993, the party adopted a social economic programme, and it was legalised in November 1993. In the 1994 election, the party won four seats. This increased to five in 1999, before falling to three in the 2004 election and to two in 2009, making it the smallest of the seven parties represented in the Tunisian parliament.

After massive protests in January 2011, Ettajdid gained a post for Ahmed Brahim as Minister of Higher Education. For the Constituent assembly election, Ettajdid formed a strongly secularist alliance called Democratic Modernist Pole (PDM), of which it was the mainstay.

On 1 April 2012, it merged with the Tunisian Labour Party and some individual members of the Democratic Modernist Pole to form the Social Democratic Path.

Ettajdid published &quot;Attariq al Jadid&quot; (New Path).

<doc id="403139" wikidata="Q1191139" url="?curid=403139" title="Point at infinity">
<text>In geometry, a point at infinity or ideal point is an idealized limiting point at the &quot;end&quot; of each line.

In the case of an affine plane (including the Euclidean plane), there is one ideal point for each pencil of parallel lines of the plane. Adjoining these points produces a projective plane, in which no point can be distinguished, if we &quot;forget&quot; which points were added. This holds for a geometry over any field, and more generally over any division ring.

In the real case, a point at infinity completes a line into a topologically closed curve. In higher dimensions, all the points at infinity form a projective subspace of one dimension less than that of the whole projective space to which they belong. A point at infinity can also be added to the complex line (which may be thought of as the complex plane), thereby turning it into a closed surface known as the complex projective line, CP1, also called the Riemann sphere (when complex numbers are mapped to each point).

In the case of a hyperbolic space, each line has two distinct ideal points. Here, the set of ideal points takes the form of a quadric.

== Affine geometry ==
In an affine or Euclidean space of higher dimension, the points at infinity are the points which are added to the space to get the projective completion. The set of the points at infinity is called, depending on the dimension of the space, the line at infinity, the plane at infinity or the hyperplane at infinity, in all cases a projective space of one less dimension.

As a projective space over a field is a smooth algebraic variety, the same is true for the set of points at infinity. Similarly, if the ground field is the real or the complex field, the set of points at infinity is a manifold.

=== Perspective ===

In artistic drawing and technical perspective, the projection on the picture plane of the point at infinity of a class of parallel lines is called their vanishing point.

== Hyperbolic geometry ==

In hyperbolic geometry, points at infinity are typically named ideal points. Unlike Euclidean and elliptic geometries, each line has two points at infinity: given a line &quot;l&quot; and a point &quot;P&quot; not on &quot;l&quot;, the right- and left-limiting parallels converge asymptotically to different points at infinity.

All points at infinity together form the Cayley absolute or boundary of a hyperbolic plane.

==Projective geometry==
A symmetry of points and lines arises in a projective plane: just as a pair of points determine a line, so a pair of lines determine a point. The existence of parallel lines leads to establishing a point at infinity which represents the intersection of these parallels. This axiomatic symmetry grew out of a study of graphical perspective where a parallel projection arises as a central projection where the center &quot;C&quot; is a point at infinity, or figurative point. The axiomatic symmetry of points and lines is called duality.

Though a point at infinity is considered on a par with any other point of a projective range, in the representation of points with projective coordinates, distinction is noted: finite points are represented with a 1 in the final coordinate while a point at infinity has a 0 there. The need to represent points at infinity requires that one extra coordinate beyond the space of finite points is needed.

== Other generalizations ==

This construction can be generalized to topological spaces. Different compactifications may exist for a given space, but arbitrary topological space admits Alexandroff extension, also called the &quot;one-point compactification&quot; when the original space is not itself compact. Projective line (over arbitrary field) is the Alexandroff extension of the corresponding field. Thus, the circle is the one-point compactification of the real line, and the sphere is the one-point compactification of the plane. Projective spaces P for  &gt; 1 are not &quot;one-point&quot; compactifications of corresponding affine spaces for the reason mentioned above under , and completions of hyperbolic spaces with ideal points are also not one-point compactifications.

<text>The Social Liberal Party ( ; ), abbreviated to PSL, is an opposition liberal political party in Tunisia. The party is a member of the Liberal International and the Africa Liberal Network.

The party was founded in September 1988 under the name &quot;Social Party for Progress&quot; (), but was renamed in October 1993 to reflect its liberal ideology. At the 1999 election, it won election for the first time, winning its first two seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

They retained these two seats at the 2004, when its candidate Mohamed Mouni Béji also won 0.8% at the presidential elections. In 2005, Mongi Khamassi, one of the party&#x27;s founders, split to form the Green Party for Progress. Despite this, the PSL quadrupled its seats to eight in the 2009 election, making it the fifth-largest party.

As well as liberal social and political reforms, the PSL advocates economic liberalisation, including the privatisation of state-owned firms.

<text>In geometry and topology, the line at infinity is a projective line that is added to the real (affine) plane in order to give closure to, and remove the exceptional cases from, the incidence properties of the resulting projective plane. The line at infinity is also called the ideal line.

==Geometric formulation==
In projective geometry, any pair of lines always intersects at some point, but parallel lines do not intersect in the real plane. The line at infinity is added to the real plane. This completes the plane, because now parallel lines intersect at a point which lies on the line at infinity. Also, if any pair of lines do not intersect at a point on the line, then the pair of lines are parallel.

Every line intersects the line at infinity at some point. The point at which the parallel lines intersect depends only on the slope of the lines, not at all on their y-intercept.

In the affine plane, a line extends in two opposite directions. In the projective plane, the two opposite directions of a line meet each other at a point on the line at infinity. Therefore, lines in the projective plane are closed curves, i.e., they are cyclical rather than linear. This is true of the line at infinity itself; it meets itself at its two endpoints (which are therefore not actually endpoints at all) and so it is actually cyclical.

==Topological perspective==
The line at infinity can be visualized as a circle which surrounds the affine plane. However, diametrically opposite points of the circle are equivalent—they are the same point. The combination of the affine plane and the line at infinity makes the real projective plane, formula_1.

A hyperbola can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in two different points. These two points are specified by the slopes of the two asymptotes of the hyperbola. Likewise, a parabola can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in a single point. This point is specified by the slope of the axis of the parabola. If the parabola is cut by its vertex into a symmetrical pair of &quot;horns&quot;, then these two horns become more parallel to each other further away from the vertex, and are actually parallel to the axis and to each other at infinity, so that they intersect at the line at infinity.

The analogue for the complex projective plane is a &#x27;line&#x27; at infinity that is (naturally) a complex projective line. Topologically this is quite different, in that it is a Riemann sphere, which is therefore a 2-sphere, being added to a complex affine space of two dimensions over &quot;C&quot; (so four &quot;real&quot; dimensions), resulting in a four-dimensional compact manifold. The result is orientable, while the real projective plane is not.

==History==
The complex line at infinity was much used in nineteenth century geometry. In fact one of the most applied tricks was to regard a circle as a conic constrained to pass through two points at infinity, the solutions of

:&quot;X&quot;2 + &quot;Y&quot;2 = 0.

This equation is the form taken by that of any circle when we drop terms of lower order in &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. More formally, we should use homogeneous coordinates

:[&quot;X:Y:Z&quot;]

and note that the line at infinity is specified by setting

: &quot;Z&quot; = 0.

Making equations homogeneous by introducing powers of &quot;Z&quot;, and then setting &quot;Z&quot; = 0, does precisely eliminate terms of lower order.

Solving the equation, therefore, we find that all circles &#x27;pass through&#x27; the &quot;circular points at infinity&quot;

:&quot;I&quot; = [1:&quot;i&quot;:0] and &quot;J&quot; = [1:−&quot;i&quot;:0].

These of course are complex points, for any representing set of homogeneous coordinates. Since the projective plane has a large enough symmetry group, they are in no way special, though. The conclusion is that the three-parameter family of circles can be treated as a special case of the linear system of conics passing through two given distinct points &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;.

<text>In projective geometry, a plane at infinity is the hyperplane at infinity of a three dimensional projective space or to any plane contained in the hyperplane at infinity of any projective space of higher dimension. This article will be concerned solely with the three-dimensional case.

==Definition==
There are two approaches to defining the &quot;plane at infinity&quot; which depend on whether one starts with a projective 3-space or an affine 3-space.

If a projective 3-space is given, the &quot;plane at infinity&quot; is any distinguished projective plane of the space. This point of view emphasizes the fact that this plane is not geometrically different than any other plane. On the other hand, given an affine 3-space, the &quot;plane at infinity&quot; is a projective plane which is added to the affine 3-space in order to give it closure of incidence properties. Meaning that the points of the &quot;plane at infinity&quot; are the points where parallel lines of the affine 3-space will meet, and the lines are the lines where parallel planes of the affine 3-space will meet. The result of the addition is the projective 3-space, formula_1. This point of view emphasizes the internal structure of the plane at infinity, but does make it look &quot;special&quot; in comparison to the other planes of the space.

If the affine 3-space is real, formula_2, then the addition of a real projective plane formula_3 at infinity produces the real projective 3-space formula_4.

==Analytic representation==
Since any two projective planes in a projective 3-space are equivalent, we can choose a homogeneous coordinate system so that any point on the plane at infinity is represented as (&quot;X&quot;:&quot;Y&quot;:&quot;Z&quot;:0).
Any point in the affine 3-space will then be represented as (&quot;X&quot;:&quot;Y&quot;:&quot;Z&quot;:1). The points on the plane at infinity seem to have three degrees of freedom, but homogeneous coordinates are equivalent up to any rescaling:

: formula_5,

so that the coordinates (&quot;X&quot;:&quot;Y&quot;:&quot;Z&quot;:0) can be normalized, thus reducing the degrees of freedom to two (thus, a surface, namely a projective plane).

&quot;Proposition&quot;: Any line which passes through the origin (0:0:0:1) and through a point (&quot;X&quot;:&quot;Y&quot;:&quot;Z&quot;:1) will intersect the plane at infinity at the point (&quot;X&quot;:&quot;Y&quot;:&quot;Z&quot;:0).

&quot;Proof&quot;: A line which passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (&quot;X&quot;:&quot;Y&quot;:&quot;Z&quot;:1) will consist of points which are linear combinations of the two given points:
:formula_6
For such a point to lie on the plane at infinity we must have, formula_7. So, by choosing formula_8, we obtain the point 
formula_9, as required. Q.E.D.

Any pair of parallel lines in 3-space will intersect each other at a point on the plane at infinity. Also, every line in 3-space intersects the plane at infinity at a unique point. This point is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the line. To determine this point, consider a line parallel to the given line, but passing through the origin, if the line does not already pass through the origin. Then choose any point, other than the origin, on this second line. If the homogeneous coordinates of this point are (&quot;X&quot;:&quot;Y&quot;:&quot;Z&quot;:1), then the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity through which the first and second line both pass is (&quot;X&quot;:&quot;Y&quot;:&quot;Z&quot;:0).

&quot;Example&quot;: Consider a line passing through the points (0:0:1:1) and (3:0:1:1). A parallel line passes through points (0:0:0:1) and (3:0:0:1). This second line intersects the plane at infinity at the point (3:0:0:0). But the first line also passes through this point:
:formula_10
::formula_11
::formula_12
when formula_13. ■

Any pair of parallel planes in affine 3-space will intersect each other in a projective line (a line at infinity) in the plane at infinity. Also, every plane in the affine 3-space intersects the plane at infinity in a unique line. This line is determined by the direction—and only by the direction—of the plane.

==Properties==
Since the plane at infinity is a projective plane, it is homeomorphic to the surface of a &quot;sphere modulo antipodes&quot;, i.e. a sphere in which antipodal points are equivalent: S2/{1,-1} where the quotient is understood as a quotient by a group action (see quotient space).

<doc id="403144" wikidata="Q7409412" url="?curid=403144" title="Sámi music">
<text>In traditional Sámi music songs (e.g. Kvad and Leudd songs) and joiks are important musical expressions of the Sámi people and Sámi languages. The Sámi also use a variety of musical instruments, some unique to the Sámi, some traditional Scandinavian, and some modern introductions.

Highly spiritual songs called joiks (; ) are the most characteristic song type. (The same word sometimes refers to lavlu or vuelie songs, though this is technically incorrect.) Joiks may have few or no lyrics, do not rhyme, and have no definite structure. They are typically about any subject of importance to the singer, and vary widely in content. In Northern areas each person often has their own joik, sometimes given to them at birth, which is seen as personal to and representative of them, like a name. Purely folk joiks have declined in popularity over the 20th century, due to the influence of pop radio and religious fundamentalism, especially Laestadianism. Joiking first came to prominence within Sweden and Scandinavia as a whole with the 1959 release of Sven-Gösta Jonsson&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Lapp&quot;, which featured the singer singing about joiking towards heathen stones over a modern, skiffle-like beat. The first commercial recordings of joiking were performed by Nils-Aslak Valkeapää in 1968, in Finland. Valkeapää&#x27;s recordings, however, differed from traditional hoiking by including both instrumentation and ambient sounds, such as barking dogs and the wind.

Nevertheless, joik performers of some fame include Angelit (former Angelin tytöt, Girls of Angeli), Wimme Saari and Nils-Aslak Valkeapää from Finnish Sápmi. Many modern singers are signed to DAT, the premier record label in Sámi music.

The most famous Sámi singer is Mari Boine of Norway, who sings a type of minimalist folk-rock with joik roots. Some non-Sámi artists, including RinneRadio, Xymox, and Jan Garbarek, have used joik and other Sámi styles in their music.

The Finnish folk metal band Sháman (now known as Korpiklaani) introduced what some call &quot;yoik metal&quot; in the late 1990s, drawing attention to Sámi music in the heavy metal scene. Their music incorporated Sámi elements such as yoik singing, Sámi lyrics, and shamanic drum. The vocalist has also yoiked for fellow Finnish folk metal band Finntroll. Also Finnish black metal band Barathrum (On Eerie album&#x27;s first track) and Swedish black metal band Arckanum have used joik parts in couple of their songs.

In January 2008, the Sámi artist Ann Marie Anderson, singing &quot;Ándagassii&quot; qualified to the finals of Melodi Grand Prix 2008, (the Norwegian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008), but she did not win. In Mars 2015 the Swedish Sámi artist Jon Henrik Fjallgren came second with his song &quot;Jag ar fri&quot; in the finals in the national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. In the October 2018 final episode of the Norwegian televised music contest Stjernekamp, 20-year-old Sámi artist Ella Marie Hætta Isaksen was voted the winner; her final performance on the show was a yoik. 

At the Eurovision Song Contest itself, joik appeared in Eurovision Song Contest 1980 with &quot;Sámiid ædnan&quot;, where Mattis Hætta performed a yoik he had composed, and 2019 thanks to the song &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; performed by the KEiiNO trio representing Norway. Parts in this language joik were performed by the Saami singer and rapper Fred Buljo, who is a member of the group. The KEiiNO team won the audience vote, but after adding up the total vote of the jury (40 points) and the audience (170 points), the trio took only 6th place in the general classification of the grand final of the competition.

==Musical instruments==
Some sources have commented on a supposed lack of musical instruments among the Sámi, with one 1885 work noting: &quot;They cannot claim to possess a single instrument of their own, not even the most primitive.&quot; Despite these beliefs, the Sámi employ a variety of musical instruments, several unique to them. Among these instruments are the &quot;fadno&quot;, a reedpipe made from &quot;Angelica archangelica&quot; stalks, and the Sámi drum. Late 18th century researchers also noted two bagpipes in Lapland: the &quot;sak-pipe&quot; and the &quot;wal-pipe&quot;.

Other Sámi instruments of wider Scandinavian usage include the lur (a long horn trumpet), and the &quot;harpu&quot;, a zither to the Finnish kantele. Willow flutes are often made from the bark of the quicken tree or mountain ash.

Modern bands use a wide variety of instruments, especially the fiddle, concertina, and accordion.
