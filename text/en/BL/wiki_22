<text>When in Rome are an English synth-pop/new wave group, which originally consisted of vocalists Clive Farrington and Andrew Mann, and keyboardist Michael Floreale. They are best known for their 1988 single &quot;The Promise&quot;, which was their only top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US. As of July 2012, there were two bands using the When in Rome name, although the original lineup has been disbanded since 1990.

==History==
===Formation===
Michael Floreale and Andy O&#x27;Connell were recruited by Clive Farrington to replace departed members of his Manchester-based group Beau Leisure. Floreale and Farrington began to write songs together. Later, Farrington and Floreale saw Andrew Mann, a beat poet, and had him join their performances. O&#x27;Connell left the group; the remaining trio recorded some demos – sometimes including Mann&#x27;s friend Corinne Drewery of Swing Out Sister – while seeking a recording deal. Farrington and Floreale came up with the band name after using the famous proverb to note the cultural differences between Manchester and London. The band was signed to Elektra Records for a month before the label closed its London office, forcing the band to leave due to the time difference with the U.S.

===Debut album===
The band was signed to Virgin UK subsidiary 10 Records, and their self-titled debut album was released on 3 May 1988. Producers Ben Rogan (who had worked with Sade) and Richard James Burgess took special interest in the trio&#x27;s song &quot;The Promise&quot;, issued first as a 12&quot; dance disc. When the song became popular, hitting the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Play chart, Virgin ordered an album. A remixed version of &quot;The Promise&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single. It was an instant success, barely missing the top ten in the United States, peaking at No. 11. Months later, the trio reached &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop chart&#x27;s lower reaches for the last time with &quot;Heaven Knows&quot; (No. 95, 1990). Additional singles did little on the charts, and the group ultimately faded away.

===Breakup, reformation, and legal issues===
In 1990, Floreale was fired by Farrington and Mann over creative differences and When in Rome disbanded shortly after Virgin Records dropped them in 1993. Floreale moved to the United States, and now lives in Dallas, Texas, where he composes music for television and film. Tensions arose between the members again in 2003, when &quot;The Promise&quot; was used in the 2004 film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; and Floreale made sole claim to the song, despite the trio receiving equal royalties.

Floreale reformed the band in 2006 with vocalist and guitarist John Ceravolo under the name &quot;When in Rome II&quot;. Since then, the band has toured the United States and South America with various other 1980s groups. Farrington and Mann reformed in 2009, under the name &quot;When in Rome UK&quot;. Floreale, however, had trademarked the name &quot;When in Rome&quot; in 2010, which was unsuccessfully challenged by Farrington and Mann. According to a &quot;Pollstar&quot; article in May 2011, the US trademark has been acknowledged: &quot;In order to comply with the legal claim, the UK members, are billed as &quot;Clive Farrington and Andrew Mann formerly of When In Rome&quot; for U.S. gigs. In addition, Floreale filed an infringement claim against Rob Juarez, an associate of Farrington and Mann who attempted to trademark his tribute band name &quot;When in Rome Revisited&quot;.

===Present day===
On 10 May 2016, Farrington, with Pat Flanagan, published his autobiography &quot;Confessions of a One Hit Wonder: &quot;The Promise&quot; ... And the Aftermath&quot;.

As of 2019, When in Rome UK performs in the U.S. as &quot;Farrington+Mann Original Members of When in Rome UK&quot;.

In 2019, When In Rome II reformed with former Ultravox singer and Enuff Z&#x27;Nuff guitarist, Tony Fennell.

In 2020, Farrington+Mann, in collaboration with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Slovenia Symphonic Film Orchestra, released a 30th anniversary orchestral edition of their hit song &quot;The Promise&quot; on both CD and vinyl.

<doc id="397470" wikidata="Q492907" url="?curid=397470" title="Hfr cell">
<text>A high-frequency recombination cell (Hfr cell) (also called an Hfr strain) is a bacterium with a conjugative plasmid (for example, the F-factor) integrated into its chromosomal DNA. The integration of the plasmid into the cell&#x27;s chromosome is through homologous recombination. A conjugative plasmid that is capable of chromosome integration or can exist autonomously within the cell is also called an episome (a segment of DNA that can exist as a plasmid or become integrated into the chromosome). When conjugation occurs, Hfr cells are very efficient in delivering chromosomal genes of the cell into recipient F− cells, which lack the episome.

==History==
The Hfr strain was first characterized by Luca Cavalli-Sforza. William Hayes also isolated another Hfr strain independently.

== Transfer of bacterial chromosome by Hfr cells == 
An Hfr cell can transfer a portion of the bacterial genome. Despite being integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the bacteria, the F factor of Hfr cells can still initiate conjugative transfer, without being excised from the bacterial chromosome first. Due to the F factor&#x27;s inherent tendency to transfer itself during conjugation, the rest of the bacterial genome is dragged along with it. Therefore, unlike a normal F+ cell, Hfr strains will attempt to transfer their &quot;entire&quot; DNA through the mating bridge, in a fashion similar to the normal conjugation. In a typical conjugation, the recipient cell also becomes F+ after conjugation as it receives an entire copy of the F factor plasmid; but this is not the case in conjugation mediated by Hfr cells. Due to the large size of bacterial chromosome, it is very rare for the entire chromosome to be transferred into the F − cell as time required is simply too long for the cells to maintain their physical contact. Therefore, as the conjugative transfer is not complete (the circular nature of plasmid and bacterial chromosome requires complete transfer for the F factor to be transferred as it may be cut in the middle), the recipient F− cells do not receive the complete F factor sequence, and do not become F + due to its inability to form a sex pilus.

== Interrupted mating technique ==
In conjugation mediated by Hfr cells, transfer of DNA starts at the origin of transfer (&quot;oriT&quot;) located within the F factor and then continues clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the orientation of F factor in the chromosome. Therefore, the length of chromosomal DNA transferred into the F− cell is proportional to the time that conjugation is allowed to happen. This results in sequential transfer of genes on the bacterial chromosome. Bacterial geneticists make use of this principle to map the genes on the bacterial chromosome. This technique is called interrupted mating as geneticists allow conjugation to take place for different periods of time before stopping conjugation with a high-speed blender. By using Hfr and F− strains with one strain carrying mutations in several genes, each affecting a metabolic function or causing antibiotic resistance, and examining the phenotype of the recipient cells on selective agar plates, one can deduce which genes are transferred into the recipient cells first and therefore are closer to the &quot;oriT&quot; sequence on the chromosome.

== The F-prime cell ==
F-prime cell contains F-plasmid that integrates with the chromosomal DNA and carries part of the chromosomal DNA along with it while being excised from the chromosome. Thus F-prime plasmid is the plasmid, containing part of the chromosomal DNA which can be transferred to recipient cell, along with the plasmid during conjugation.

<doc id="397490" wikidata="Q113681" url="?curid=397490" title="Israel Zangwill">
<text>Israel Zangwill (21 January 18641 August 1926) was a British author at the forefront of Zionism during the 19th century, and was a close associate of Theodor Herzl. He later rejected the search for a Jewish homeland in Palestine and became the prime thinker behind the territorial movement.

==Early life and education==
Zangwill was born in Whitechapel, London on 21 January 1864, in a family of Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. His father, Moses Zangwill, was from what is now Latvia, and his mother, Ellen Hannah Marks Zangwill, was from what is now Poland. He dedicated his life to championing the cause of people he considered oppressed, becoming involved with topics such as Jewish emancipation, Jewish assimilation, territorialism, Zionism, and women&#x27;s suffrage. His brother was novelist Louis Zangwill.

Zangwill received his early schooling in Plymouth and Bristol. When he was eight years old, his parents moved to Spitalfields, East London and he was enrolled in the Jews&#x27; Free School there, a school for Jewish immigrant children. The school offered a strict course of both secular and religious studies while supplying clothing, food, and health care for the scholars; presently one of its four houses is named Zangwill in his honour. At this school he excelled and even taught part-time, eventually becoming a full-fledged teacher.

While teaching, he studied for his degree from the University of London, earning a BA with triple honours in 1884.

==Career==
===Writings===
Zangwill published some of his works under the pen-names J. Freeman Bell (for works written in collaboration), and Countess von S. and Marshallik.

He had already written a tale entitled &quot;The Premier and the Painter&quot; in collaboration with Louis Cowen, when he resigned his position as a teacher at the Jews&#x27; Free School owing to differences with the school managers and ventured into journalism. He initiated and edited &quot;Ariel, The London Puck&quot;, and did miscellaneous work for the London press.
Zangwill&#x27;s work earned him the nickname &quot;the Dickens of the Ghetto&quot;. He wrote a very influential novel &quot;Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People&quot; (1892), which the late 19th-century English novelist George Gissing called &quot;a powerful book&quot;.

The use of the metaphorical phrase &quot;melting pot&quot; to describe American absorption of immigrants was popularised by Zangwill&#x27;s play &quot;The Melting Pot&quot;, a success in the United States in 1909–10. The theatrical work explored the themes of ethnic tensions and the idea of cultural assimilation in early 20th-century America.

When &quot;The Melting Pot&quot; opened in Washington, D.C., on 5 October 1908, former President Theodore Roosevelt leaned over the edge of his box and shouted &quot;That&#x27;s a great play, Mr. Zangwill. That&#x27;s a great play.&quot; In 1912, Zangwill received a letter from Roosevelt in which Roosevelt wrote of &quot;The Melting Pot&quot; &quot;That particular play I shall always count among the very strong and real influences upon my thought and my life.&quot;

The protagonist of the play is David Quixano, a Russian Jewish immigrant who arrives in New York City after the Kishinev pogrom, in which his entire family is killed. He writes a great symphony named &quot;The Crucible&quot; expressing his hope for a world in which all ethnicity has melted away, and becomes enamored of a beautiful Russian Christian immigrant named Vera. The dramatic climax of the play is the moment when David meets Vera&#x27;s father, who turns out to be the Russian officer responsible for the annihilation of David&#x27;s family. Vera&#x27;s father admits guilt, the symphony is performed to accolades, and David and Vera agree to wed and kiss as the curtain falls.

&quot;&quot;Melting Pot&quot; celebrated America&#x27;s capacity to absorb and grow from the contributions of its immigrants.&quot; Zangwill was writing as &quot;a Jew who no longer wanted to be a Jew. His real hope was for a world in which the entire lexicon of racial and religious difference is thrown away.&quot;

However, the play also addresses the challenges and conflicts that arise when different ethnic groups collide. It portrays the tensions between the Jewish and Christian communities, as well as the struggles of immigrants to find their place in a new society while preserving their cultural heritage.

&quot;The Melting Pot&quot; resonated with audiences during its time, as it captured the spirit of the American immigrant experience and explored issues of assimilation, identity, and the potential for a unified nation. The play contributed to the discourse on multiculturalism and the American identity, and it remains a significant work in the context of American theater and the portrayal of ethnic tensions on stage.

Zangwill wrote many other plays, including, on Broadway, &quot;Children of the Ghetto&quot; (1899), a dramatization of his own novel, directed by James A. Herne and starring Blanche Bates, Ada Dwyer, and Wilton Lackaye; &quot;Merely Mary Ann&quot; (1903) and &quot;Nurse Marjorie&quot; (1906), both of which were directed by Charles Cartwright and starred Eleanor Robson. Liebler &amp; Co. produced all three plays as well as &quot;The Melting Pot&quot;. Daniel Frohman produced Zangwill&#x27;s 1904 play &quot;The Serio-Comic Governess&quot;, featuring Cecilia Loftus, Kate Pattison-Selten, and Julia Dean. In 1931, Jules Furthman adapted &quot;Merely Mary Ann&quot; for a movie with Janet Gaynor.

Zangwill&#x27;s simulation of Yiddish sentence structure in English aroused great interest. He also wrote mystery works, such as &quot;The Big Bow Mystery&quot; (1892), and social satire, such as &quot;The King of Schnorrers&quot; (1894), a picaresque novel (which became a short-lived musical comedy in 1979). His &quot;Dreamers of the Ghetto&quot; (1898) includes essays on famous Jews such as Baruch Spinoza, Heinrich Heine and Ferdinand Lassalle.

&quot;The Big Bow Mystery&quot; was one of the first locked room mystery novels. It has been almost continuously in print since 1891 and has been used as the basis for three movies.

Another much produced play was &quot;The Lens Grinder&quot;, based on the life of Spinoza.
===Politics===
Zangwill endorsed feminism and pacifism, but his greatest effect may have been as a writer who popularised the idea of the combination of ethnicities into a single, American nation. The hero of his widely produced play &quot;The Melting Pot&quot; proclaims: &quot;America is God&#x27;s Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and reforming...Germans and Frenchmen, Irishmen and Englishmen, Jews and Russians – into the Crucible with you all! God is making the American.&quot;

====Jewish politics====
Zangwill was also involved with specifically Jewish issues as an assimilationist, an early Zionist, and a territorialist. Jewish territorialism was a political movement that emerged as a response to the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe during the early 20th century. It proposed the establishment of a Jewish homeland outside of Palestine, offering alternative solutions to the ongoing debate about Jewish self-determination and Zionism. After having for a time endorsed Theodor Herzl, including presiding over a meeting at the Maccabean Club, London, addressed by Herzl on 24 November 1895, and endorsing the main Palestine-oriented Zionist movement. Zangwill changed his mind and founded his own organization, named the Jewish Territorialist Organization in 1905, advocating a Jewish homeland in whatever land might be available in the world which could be found for them, with speculations including Canada, Australia, Mesopotamia, Uganda and Cyrenaica.

Zangwill is inaccurately known for creating the slogan &quot;A land without a people for a people without a land&quot; describing Zionist aspirations in the Biblical land of Israel. He did not invent the phrase; he acknowledged borrowing it from Lord Shaftesbury. In 1853, during the preparation for the Crimean War, Shaftesbury wrote to Foreign Secretary Aberdeen that Greater Syria was &quot;a country without a nation&quot; in need of &quot;a nation without a country... Is there such a thing? To be sure there is, the ancient and rightful lords of the soil, the Jews!&quot; In his diary that year he wrote &quot;these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion. The territory must be assigned to some one or other... There is a country without a nation; and God now in his wisdom and mercy, directs us to a nation without a country.&quot; Shaftesbury himself was echoing the sentiments of Alexander Keith, D.D.

In 1901, in the &quot;New Liberal Review&quot;, Zangwill wrote that &quot;Palestine is a country without a people; the Jews are a people without a country&quot;.

Theodor Herzl got along well with Israel Zangwill and Max Nordau. They were both writers or &#x27;men of letters&#x27;. In November 1901 Zangwill was still misreading the situation: &quot;Palestine has but a small population of Arabs and fellahin and wandering, lawless, blackmailing Bedouin tribes.&quot; To conclude his opening address to the Article Club, Zangwill pretended to speak as the weary, Ashkenazic folktale character, the Wandering Jew, saying, &quot;restore the country without a people to the people without a country... For we have something to give as well as to get. We can sweep away the blackmailerbe he Pasha or Bedouinwe can make the wilderness blossom as the rose, and build up in the heart of the world a civilization that may be a mediator and interpreter between the East and the West.&quot;

In 1902, Zangwill wrote that Palestine &quot;remains at this moment an almost uninhabited, forsaken and ruined Turkish territory&quot;. However, within a few years, Zangwill had &quot;become fully aware of the Arab peril&quot;, telling an audience in New York, &quot;Palestine proper has already its inhabitants. The pashalik of Jerusalem is already twice as thickly populated as the United States&quot; leaving Zionists the choice of driving the Arabs out or dealing with a &quot;large alien population&quot;. He moved his support to the Uganda scheme, leading to a break with the mainstream Zionist movement by 1905. In 1908, Zangwill told a London court that he had been naive when he made his 1901 speech and had since &quot;realized what is the density of the Arab population&quot;, namely twice that of the United States. In 1913 he criticized those who insisted on repeating that Palestine was &quot;empty and derelict&quot; and who called him a traitor for reporting otherwise.

According to Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, Zangwill told him in 1916 that, &quot;If you wish to give a country to a people without a country, it is utter foolishness to allow it to be the country of two peoples. This can only cause trouble. The Jews will suffer and so will their neighbours. One of the two: a different place must be found either for the Jews or for their neighbours&quot;.

In 1917, he wrote &quot;&#x27;Give the country without a people,&#x27; magnanimously pleaded Lord Shaftesbury, &#x27;to the people without a country.&#x27; Alas, it was a misleading mistake. The country holds 600,000 Arabs.&quot;In 1921, Zangwill suggested Lord Shaftesbury &quot;was literally inexact in describing Palestine as a country without a people, he was essentially correct, for there is no Arab people living in intimate fusion with the country, utilizing its resources and stamping it with a characteristic impress: there is at best an Arab encampment, the break-up of which would throw upon the Jews the actual manual labor of regeneration and prevent them from exploiting the &quot;fellahin&quot;, whose numbers and lower wages are moreover a considerable obstacle to the proposed immigration from Poland and other suffering centers&quot;.

== Quotes ==
Zangwill listed the following as his more striking passages:

* What is, is right. If aught seem wrong below,/Then wrong it is – of thee to leave it so. – &quot;Without Prejudice&quot;
* Art is truth seen as beauty. – &quot;The Master&quot;
* Hunted from shore to shore through the ages they had found the national aspiration – peace – in a country where Passover came without menace of blood. – &quot;Children of the Ghetto&quot;
* The Jewish mission will never be over till the Christians are converted to the religion of Christ. – &quot;Dreamers of the Ghetto&quot;
* Each poor man is a rung in the Jacob&#x27;s ladder by which the rich man may, if he is charitable, mount to heaven. – &quot;The King of Schnorrers&quot;

== Views ==
In his writings, Zangwill expressed mixed sentiments about the then-territory of Palestine, parts of which became the modern State of Israel in 1948, two decades after his death. After the establishment of the state, Philip Rubin speculated that the new state might have met his aspirations.

He was an early suffragist.

During World War I, he advocated the formation of a Jewish foreign legion to the central powers.

&quot;The League of Damnations&quot; is a term associated with Zangwill&#x27;s critique of the anti-Semitic sentiment prevalent in Europe during his time. He used this phrase to describe the collective hostility and discrimination faced by Jewish people in various countries. Zangwill was an ardent opponent of anti-Semitism and used his writings to expose and challenge the prejudices and injustices faced by Jews.

==Personal life==
Zangwill married Edith Ayrton in 1903. She was a feminist and author, and the daughter of cousins William Edward Ayrton and Matilda Chaplin Ayrton. Ayrton&#x27;s stepmother was Hertha Ayrton, who, like Zangwill, was Jewish.

The Zangwill family lived for many years in East Preston, West Sussex in a house named Far End. The couple had three children, two sons and a daughter. The younger of their two sons was the British psychologist Oliver Zangwill.

Zangwill died of pneumonia on 1 August 1926 at a nursing home in Midhurst, West Sussex. He had spent two months at the nursing home.

<text>Hannah Adelle Weiner (née Finegold) (November 4, 1928 – September 11, 1997) was an American poet who is often grouped with the &quot;Language poets&quot; because of the prominent place she assumed in the poetics of that group.

== Early life and writings ==
Weiner was born in Providence, Rhode Island and attended Classical High School, until 1946, and then Radcliffe College. She graduated with a B.A. in 1950, with a dissertation on Henry James. Working in publishing and then in Bloomingdale&#x27;s department store, she was married and then divorced after four years. 

Weiner started writing poetry in 1963 though her first chapbook, &quot;The Magritte Poems&quot; after René Magritte, was not published until 1970. It is not indicative of her latter work, being &quot;basically a New York School attempt to write verse in response to the paintings of René Magritte&quot;. 

During the 1960s she also organized and participated in a number of happenings with other members of the New York City art scene, where she had been living for some time. These included &#x27;Hannah Weiner at Her Job&#x27;, &quot;a sort of open house hosted by her employer, A.H. Schreiber Co., Inc.&quot; and &#x27;Fashion Show Poetry Event&#x27; with Eduardo Costa, John Perreault, Andy Warhol and others in a &quot;collaborative and innovative enterprise that incorporated conceptual art, design, poetry and performance.&quot; 

During this time Weiner composed poems using flag semaphore and the International Code of Signals, including a version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet titled &quot;R+J.&quot; In 1968, These works were performed by off-duty U.S. Coast Guard signalers in Central Park.

In the late 1960s Weiner&#x27;s work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an experimental avant-garde magazine that explored language and meaning-making.

== Mature work ==
In the early 1970s, Weiner began writing a series of journals that were partly the result of her experiments with automatic writing and partly a result of her schizophrenia. Judith Goldman claims that politics and ethics were central to a mode of writing she developed and called &quot;clair-style,&quot; which used &quot;words and phrases clairvoyantly seen&quot; and that Weiner arrived at a method of composing that employed &quot;these seen elements exclusively.&quot; Goldman also provides the insight that &quot;Weiner let no representation of herself circulate that did not take her status as a clairvoyant into account.&quot;
She influenced a number of the language poets and was included in the &quot;In the American Tree&quot; anthology of Language poetry (edited by Ron Silliman). Beginning with &quot;Little Books/Indians&quot; (1980) and &quot;Spoke&quot; (1984) Weiner&#x27;s work engaged with Native American politics, particularly the American Indian Movement and the case of imprisoned activist Leonard Peltier.

==Legacy==

Interest in Weiner continues into the 21st century with the recent publication of &quot;Hannah Weiner’s Open House&quot; (2007), &quot;a representative selection spanning her decades of poetic output&quot; This volume was edited by Patrick F. Durgin, who provides an overview of Weiner&#x27;s art:

In 2016, her &quot;Code Poems&quot; and early performance work was commemorated in a Public Art Fund exhibition outside of New York City Hall. In 2019, the code poem &quot;R+J&quot; was publicly reperformed in Central Park for the first time in 50 years.

<text>The Lake County Captains are a Minor League Baseball team in Eastlake, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, that plays in the Midwest League as the High-A affiliate of the Cleveland Guardians.

The Captains joined the Class A Midwest League following the 2009 season in a shuffle caused by the Columbus Catfish&#x27;s move to Bowling Green, Kentucky, for the 2009 season. The move alleviated travel costs and time, as it was the South Atlantic League&#x27;s northernmost team.

Before the 2003 season, the club was based in Columbus, Georgia, and known as the Columbus RedStixx. The Captains play their home games in Classic Auto Group Park, which has a capacity of 6,157 and opened in 2003 as Eastlake Stadium. The current stadium name results from a naming rights arrangement; the sponsor is Classic Automotive Group, a significant area chain of auto dealerships. Classic Auto Group Park hosted the South Atlantic League All-Star Game on June 20, 2006.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Captains were organized into the High-A Central. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit before the 2021 reorganization.

<text>Hypoplectrus is a genus of fishes commonly known as hamlets, found mainly in coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, particularly around Florida and the Bahamas. They are a popular choice for hobbyist saltwater aquariums, and come in a variety of colors.

==Species==
There are currently 17 recognized species in this genus:
* &quot;Hypoplectrus aberrans&quot; (Yellowbelly hamlet)
* &quot;Hypoplectrus atlahua&quot; (Jarocho hamlet) 
* &quot;Hypoplectrus castroaguirrei&quot; 
* &quot;Hypoplectrus chlorurus&quot; (Yellowtail hamlet)
* &quot;Hypoplectrus ecosur&quot; 
* &quot;Hypoplectrus floridae&quot; 
* &quot;Hypoplectrus gemma&quot; (Blue hamlet) 
* &quot;Hypoplectrus gummigutta&quot; (Golden hamlet) 
* &quot;Hypoplectrus guttavarius&quot; (Shy hamlet)
* &quot;Hypoplectrus indigo&quot; (Indigo hamlet) 
* &quot;Hypoplectrus maculiferus&quot; 
* &quot;Hypoplectrus maya&quot; (Maya hamlet)
* &quot;Hypoplectrus nigricans&quot; (Black hamlet)
* &quot;Hypoplectrus providencianus&quot; (Masked hamlet) 
* &quot;Hypoplectrus puella&quot; (Barred hamlet)
* &quot;Hypoplectrus randallorum&quot; (Tan hamlet)
* &quot;Hypoplectrus unicolor&quot; (Butter hamlet)

==Reproduction==
Hamlets are &quot;simultaneous hermaphrodites&quot; (or &quot;synchronous hermaphrodites&quot;): They have both male and female sexual organs at the same time as an adult, meaning that they function as a male and female, making them one of the few vertebrates that are male and female at the same time. They seem quite at ease mating in front of divers, allowing observations in the wild to occur readily. They do not practice self-fertilization, but when they find a mate, the pair takes turns between which one acts as the male and which acts as the female through multiple matings, usually over the course of several nights. Hamlets preferentially mate with individuals of their same color pattern.

<doc id="397520" wikidata="Q13211" url="?curid=397520" title="Ruthenian language">
<text>Ruthenian ( or ; see also other names) is an exonymic linguonym for a closely related group of East Slavic linguistic varieties, particularly those spoken from the 15th to 18th centuries in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and in East Slavic regions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Regional distribution of those varieties, both in their literary and vernacular forms, corresponded approximately to the territories of the modern states of Belarus and Ukraine. By the end of the 18th century, they gradually diverged into regional variants, which subsequently developed into the modern Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Rusyn languages, all of which are mutually intelligible. 

Several linguistic issues are debated among linguists: various questions related to classification of literary and vernacular varieties of this language; issues related to meanings and proper uses of various endonymic (native) and exonymic (foreign) glottonyms (names of languages and linguistic varieties); questions on its relation to modern East Slavic languages, and its relation to Old East Slavic (the colloquial language used in Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 10th through 13th centuries).

==Nomenclature==
Since the term &quot;Ruthenian language&quot; was exonymic (foreign, both in origin and nature), its use was very complex, both in historical and modern scholarly terminology. 

===Names in historical use===
Contemporary names, that were used for this language from the 15th to 18th centuries, can be divided into two basic linguistic categories, the first being endonyms (native names, used by native speakers as self-designations for their language), and the second exonyms (names in foreign languages).

Common endonyms:
* , written in various ways, as: , and also as: (&quot;ruskiy yazyk″&quot;).
* (meaning: the &quot;simple speech&quot;, or the &quot;simple talk&quot;), also written in various ways, as: or (Old Belarusian / Old Ukrainian: or , ) – publisher Hryhorii Khodkevych (16th century). Those terms for simple vernacular speech were designating its diglossic opposition to literary Church Slavonic.
* It was sometimes also referred to (in territorial terms) as ( / Lithuanian). Also by Zizaniy (end of the 16th century), Pamva Berynda (1653).

Common exonyms:
* in , or , which is rendered in English as: &quot;Ruthenian&quot; or &quot;Ruthene&quot; language.
* in , derived from the Latin exonym for this language.
* in , also derived from the Latin exonym.

===Names in modern use=== 
Modern names of this language and its varieties, that are used by scholars (mainly linguists), can also be divided in two basic categories, the first including those that are derived from endonymic (native) names, and the second encompassing those that are derived from exonymic (foreign) names.

Names derived from endonymic terms:

* One &quot;s&quot; terms: &quot;Rus’ian&quot;, &quot;Rusian&quot;, &quot;Rusky&quot; or &quot;Ruski&quot;, employed explicitly with only one letter &quot;s&quot; in order to distinguish this name from terms that are designating modern Russian.
* &quot;West Russian&quot; language or dialect (, западнорусское наречие) – terms used mainly by supporters of the concept of the Proto-Russian phase, especially since the end of the 19th century. Employed by authors such as Karskiy and Shakhmatov.
* &quot;Old Belarusian&quot; language () – term used by various Belarusian and some Russian scholars, and also by Kryzhanich. The denotation &quot;Belarusian&quot; (language) () when referring &quot;both&quot; to the post-19th-century language and to the older language had been used in works of the 19th-century Russian researchers Fyodor Buslayev, Ogonovskiy, Zhitetskiy, Sobolevskiy, Nedeshev, Vladimirov and Belarusian researchers, such as Karskiy.
* &quot;Old Ukrainian&quot; language () – term used by various Ukrainian and some other scholars.
* &quot;Lithuanian-Russian&quot; language () – regionally oriented designation, used by some 19th-century Russian researchers such as: Keppen, archbishop Filaret, Sakharov, Karatayev.
* &quot;Lithuanian-Slavic&quot; language () – another regionally oriented designation, used by 19th-century Russian researcher Baranovskiy.
* &quot;Chancery Slavonic&quot;, or &quot;Chancery Slavic&quot; – a term used for the written form, based on Old Church Slavonic, but influenced by various local dialects and used in the chancery of Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Names derived from exonymic terms:

* &quot;Ruthenian&quot; or &quot;Ruthene&quot; language – modern scholarly terms, derived from older Latin exonyms (, &quot;lingua ruthena&quot;), commonly used by scholars who are writing in English and other western languages, and also by various Lithuanian and Polish scholars. 
* &quot;Ruthenian literary language&quot;, or &quot;Literary Ruthenian language&quot; – terms used by the same groups of scholars in order to designate more precisely the literary variety of this language.
* &quot;Ruthenian chancery language&quot;, or &quot;Chancery Ruthenian language&quot; – terms used by the same groups of scholars in order to designate more precisely the chancery variety of this language, used in official and legal documents of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
* &quot;Ruthenian common language&quot;, or &quot;Common Ruthenian language&quot; – terms used by the same groups of scholars in order to designate more precisely the vernacular variety of this language. 
* &quot;North Ruthenian&quot; dialect or language – a term used by some scholars as designation for northern varieties, that gave rise to modern Belarusian language, that is also designated as &quot;White Ruthenian&quot;. 
* &quot;South Ruthenian&quot; dialect or language – a term used by some scholars as designation for southern varieties, that gave rise to modern Ukrainian language, that is also designated as &quot;Red Ruthenian&quot;.

Terminological dichotomy, embodied in parallel uses of various endoymic and exonymic terms, resulted in a vast variety of ambiguous, overlapping or even contrary meanings, that were applied to particular terms by different scholars. That complex situation is addressed by most English and other western scholars by preferring the exonymic &quot;Ruthenian&quot; designations.

==Periodization==
Daniel Bunčić suggested a periodization of the literary language into:

# Early Ruthenian, dating from the separation of Lithuanian and Muscovite chancery languages (15th century) to the early 16th century 
# High Ruthenian, from Francysk Skaryna (fl. 1517–25), to Ivan Uzhevych (&quot;Hramatyka slovenskaia&quot;, 1643, 1645) 
# Late Ruthenian, from 1648 to the establishment of the Ukrainian and Belarusian standard languages at the end of the 18th century

== Development ==
=== Early Ruthenian ( 1300–1550) ===
According to linguist Andrii Danylenko (2006), what is now called &#x27;Ruthenian&#x27; first arose as a primarily administrative language in the 14th and 15th centuries, shaped by the chancery of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in Vilnius (&quot;Vilna&quot;). He identified the Polissian (Polesian) dialect spoken on both sides of the modern Belarusian–Ukrainian border as the basis of both written Ruthenian (&quot;rusьkij jazykъ&quot; or Chancery Slavonic) and spoken dialects of Ruthenian (проста(я) мова &quot;prosta(ja) mova&quot; or &quot;simple speech&quot;), which he called &#x27;two stylistically differentiated varieties of one secular vernacular standard&#x27;.

From the second half of the 15th century through the 16th century, when present-day Ukraine and Belarus were part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Renaissance had a major impact on shifting culture, art and literature away from Byzantine Christian theocentrism as expressed in Church Slavonic. Instead, they moved towards humanist anthropocentrism, which in writing was increasingly expressed by taking the vernacular language of the common people as the basis of texts. New literary genres developed that were closer to secular topics, such as poetry, polemical literature, and scientific literature, while Church Slavonic works of previous times were translated into what became known as Ruthenian, Chancery Slavonic, or Old Ukrainian (also called проста мова &quot;prosta mova&quot; or &quot;simple language&quot; since the 14th century). It is virtually impossible to differentiate Ruthenian texts into &quot;Ukrainian&quot; and &quot;Belarusian&quot; subgroups until the 16th century; with some variety, these were all functionally one language between the 14th and 16th century.

=== High Ruthenian ( 1550–1650) ===
The vernacular Ruthenian &quot;business speech&quot; () of the 16th century would spread to most other domains of everyday communication in the 17th century, with an influx of words, expressions and style from Polish and other European languages, while the usage of Church Slavonic became more restricted to the affairs of religion, the church, hagiography, and some forms of art and science.

The 1569 Union of Lublin establishing the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had significant linguistic implications: the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (which now included Ukraine) had previously used Latin for administration, but switched to Middle Polish (standardised 1569–1648), while the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (including Belarus, but no longer Ukraine) gave up Chancery Slavonic (Ruthenian) and also switched to Middle Polish. Much of the Polish and Ruthenian nobility briefly converted to various kinds of Protestantism during the Reformation, but in the end all of them either returned or converted to Catholicism and increasingly used the Polish language; while Ukrainian nobles thus Polonised, most Ukrainian (and Belarusian) peasants remained Orthodox-believing and Ruthenian-speaking.

=== Late Ruthenian ( 1650–1800) ===
When the Cossack Hetmanate arose in the mid-17th century, Polish remained a language of administration in the Hetmanate, and most Cossack officers and Polish nobles (two groups which overlapped a lot) still communicated with each other using a combination of Latin, Polish and Ruthenian (Old Ukrainian). On the other hand, the language barrier between Cossack officers and Muscovite officials had become so great that they needed translators to understand each other during negotiations, and hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky &#x27;had letters in Muscovite dialect translated into Latin, so that he could read them.&#x27;

The 17th century witnessed the standardisation of the Ruthenian language that would later split into modern Ukrainian and Belarusian. From the 16th century onwards, two regional variations of spoken Ruthenian began to emerge as written Ruthenian gradually lost its prestige to Polish in administration. The spoken &quot;prosta(ja) mova&quot; disappeared in the early 18th century, to be replaced by a more Polonised (central) early Belarusian variety and a more Slavonicised (southwestern) early Ukrainian variety. Meanwhile, Church Slavonic remained the literary and administrative standard in Russia until the late 18th century.

<text>Science and technology in Israel is one of the country&#x27;s most developed sectors. Israel spent 4.3% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on civil research and development in 2015, the highest ratio in the world. In 2019, Israel was ranked the world&#x27;s fifth most innovative country by the Bloomberg Innovation Index. It ranks thirteenth in the world for scientific output as measured by the number of scientific publications per million citizens. In 2014, Israel&#x27;s share of scientific articles published worldwide (0.9%) was nine times higher than its share of the global population (0.1%). 

Israel counts 140 scientists and technicians per 10,000 employees, one of the highest ratios in the world. In comparison, there are 85 per 10,000 in the United States and 83 per 10,000 in Japan. In 2012, Israel counted 8,337 full-time equivalent researchers per million inhabitants. This compares with 3,984 in the US, 6,533 in the Republic of South Korea and 5,195 in Japan. Israel&#x27;s high technology industry has benefited from both the country&#x27;s highly educated and technologically skilled workforce coupled with the strong presence of foreign high-tech firms and sophisticated research centres.

Israel is home to major companies in the high-tech industry and has one of the world&#x27;s most technologically literate populations. In 1998, Tel Aviv was named by &quot;Newsweek&quot; as one of the ten most technologically influential cities in the world. Since 2000, Israel has been a member of EUREKA, the pan-European research and development funding and coordination organization, and held the rotating chairmanship of the organization for 2010–2011. In 2010, American journalist David Kaufman wrote that the high-tech area of Yokneam, Israel, has the &quot;world&#x27;s largest concentration of aesthetics-technology companies&quot;. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt complimented the country during a visit there, saying that “Israel has the most important high-tech center in the world after the US.” Israel was ranked 15th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, down from tenth in 2019. The Tel Aviv region was ranked the 4th global tech ecosystem in the world.
== History ==
Jewish settlement in Israel was motivated by both ideology and flight from persecution. Return to the homeland was an important aspect of Jewish immigration and was perceived by many as a return to the soil. To establish the rural villages that formed the core of Zionist ideology and produce self-supporting Jewish farmers, agronomic experiments were conducted. The foundations of agricultural research in Israel were laid by the teachers and graduates of the Mikveh Yisrael School, the country&#x27;s first agricultural school, established by the Alliance Israelite Universelle in 1870. On a field trip to Mount Hermon in 1906, the agronomist Aaron Aaronsohn discovered Triticum dicoccoides, or emmer wheat, believed to be the &quot;mother of all wheat.&quot; In 1909, he founded an agricultural research station in Atlit where he built up an extensive library and collected geological and botanical samples. The Agricultural Station, founded in Rehovot in 1921, engaged in soil research and other aspects of farming in the country&#x27;s difficult climatic conditions. This station, which became the Agricultural Research Organization (ARO), is now Israel&#x27;s major institution of agricultural research and development.
In 1912, the first cornerstone of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology was laid at a festive ceremony in Haifa, which was then occupied by the Ottoman Empire. The Technion would become a unique university worldwide in its claim to precede and create a nation. As Jews were often barred from technical education in Europe, the Technion claims to have brought the skills needed to build a modern state.

Established before World War I, the Hebrew Health Station in Jerusalem, founded by Nathan Straus engaged in medical and public health research, operating departments for public hygiene, eye diseases and bacteriology. The station manufactured vaccines against typhus and cholera, and developed methods of pest control to eliminate field mice. The Pasteur Institute affiliated with the station developed a rabies vaccine. Departments for microbiology, biochemistry, bacteriology, and hygiene were opened at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, founded on Mount Scopus in 1925. In 1936, Jewish workers in the center of the country donated two-days&#x27; pay toward the establishment of the &quot;Hospital of Judea and Sharon,&quot; later renamed Beilinson Hospital. In 1938, Beilinson established the country&#x27;s first blood bank. The Rothschild-Hadassah University Hospital on Mount Scopus opened in 1939 and was the first teaching hospital and medical center in the country. Since renamed the Hadassah Medical Center, it has become a leader in medical research.
Industrial research began at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, was also initiated at the Daniel Sieff Research Center (later the Weizmann Institute of Science), established in 1934 in Rehovot. The Dead Sea Laboratories opened in the 1930s. The first modern electronic computer in Israel and the Middle East, and one of the first large-scale, stored-program, electronic computers in the world, called WEIZAC, was built at the Weizmann Institute during 1954–1955, based on the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) architecture developed by John von Neumann. WEIZAC has been recognized by the IEEE as a milestone in the history of electrical engineering and computing. IBM Israel, registered on June 8, 1950, was the country&#x27;s first high-tech firm. The company, located on Allenby Street in Tel Aviv, assembled and repaired punch card machines, sorting machines and tabulators. In 1956, a local plant was opened to produce punch cards, and a year later, the first service center opened, offering computerized data processing services.

Scientific and technological research in Israel was boosted by the appointment of a chief scientist for the Industry and Trade Ministry at the recommendation of a committee headed by Ephraim Katzir, later president of Israel. The Israeli government provided grants that covered 50–80 percent of the outlay for new start-ups, with no conditions, no shareholding and no participation in management. In the early 1980s, Control Data Corporation, a partner in Elron Electronic Industries, formed the country&#x27;s first venture capital firm.

=== Origins of Israeli high-tech industry ===
Israel&#x27;s high-technology industries are a spin-off of the rapid development of computer science and technology in the 1980s in such places as Silicon Valley and Massachusetts Route 128 in the US, which ushered in the current high-tech era. Up until that point, Israel&#x27;s economy had been essentially based on agriculture, mining and secondary sectors such as diamond polishing and manufacturing in textiles, fertilizers and plastics.

The key factor which enabled high-tech industries based on information and communication technologies to take root and flourish in Israel was investment by the defense and aerospace industries, which spawned new technologies and know-how. Israel devoted 17.1% of its GDP to military expenditure in 1988. Even though this share had dropped to 5.8% of GDP by 2016, Israel military spending remains among the highest in the world. For the purposes of comparison, the United States devoted 5.7% of its GDP to military expenditure in 1988 and 3.3% in 2016. This heavy investment in defense and aerospace formed the basis for Israel&#x27;s high-tech industries in medical devices, electronics, telecommunications, computer software and hardware.

The massive Russian immigration of the 1990s reinforced this phenomenon, doubling the number of engineers and scientists in Israel overnight. Between 1989 and 2006, about 979,000 Russian Jews and their relatives migrated to Israel, which had a population of just 4.5 million in 1989.

The purchase of Mirabilis in 1998 marked the first big exit of high technology in Israel and caused a rush of Israeli companies as part of the Dot-com bubble.

=== Contemporary high-tech industry in Israel ===

Currently, Israel has the world&#x27;s most research-intensive business sector. In 2018, 4.95% of its GDP was invested in research and technology. Meanwhile, Israel&#x27;s technology sector plays a crucial role in the country&#x27;s economy. In 2021, the Israeli high-technology sector accounted for around 12% of the country&#x27;s economic output and 10% of its national labour force.

Competitive grants and tax incentives are the two main public policy instruments in supporting business research and development. Thanks to generous government incentives and the availability of highly trained human capital, Israel has become an attractive location for the research and development centers of leading multinational corporations around the world. The country&#x27;s national innovation ecosystem relies on both foreign multinationals and large corporate investors in research and development, as well as on start-ups. 

As of 2019, some 530 foreign research centres were currently active in Israel. Many of these centers are owned by large multinational firms that have acquired Israeli companies, technology and know-how and transformed them through mergers and acquisitions into their own local research facilities. The activity of some research centers even spans more than three decades, such as those of Intel, Applied Materials, Motorola and IBM.

In the late 2010s, Israel saw a sharp increase in the number of high-technology startups that achieved &#x27;unicorn status&#x27; (a financing round at a valuation of $1 billion or more): in 2016, Israel had 10 such startups. By 2019, the number had risen to 19. Be the end of 2021, 74 tech unicorns had emerged from Israel&#x27;s tech sector - 33 in 2021 alone. The growth in the number of unicorn startups in Israel, together with tech startups maturing to become public companies rather being acquired earlier in their lifecycle, has led to the suggestion that Israel has transitioned from &#x27;Startup Nation&#x27; to &#x27;Scale-up Nation&#x27;.

== Higher education policy ==

=== Sixth Higher Education Plan ===
Israel&#x27;s higher education system is regulated by the Council for Higher Education and its Planning and Budgeting Committee. The Israeli higher education system operates under a multi-year plan agreed upon by the Planning and Budgeting Committee (PBC) and the Ministry of Finance. Each plan determines policy objectives and, accordingly, the budgets to be allocated in order to achieve these objectives.

The annual government allocation to universities totalled about US$1.75 billion in 2015, providing 50–75% of their operating budgets. Much of the remainder of their operating budget (15–20%) comes from annual student tuition fees, which are uniform at about US$2,750 per year. The &quot;Sixth Higher Education Plan&quot; (2011–2016) makes provision for a 30% rise in the Council for Higher Education&#x27;s budget. The &quot;Sixth Plan&quot; changes the budgeting model of the PBC by placing greater emphasis on excellence in research, along with quantitative measures for the number of students. Under this model, 75% of the committee&#x27;s budget (NIS 7 billion over six years) is being allocated to institutions offering higher education. The &quot;Sixth Higher Education Plan&quot; launched the Israeli Centres of Research Excellence (I-CORE) programme in October 2011. This reflects a renewed interest in funding academic research and constitutes a strong indication of a reversal in government policy.

=== Israeli Centres of Research Excellence ===
The Israeli Centres of Research Excellence (I-CORE) programme, which dates from 2011, envisions the establishment of cross-institutional clusters of top researchers in specific fields and returning young Israeli scientists from abroad, with each centre being endowed with state-of-the-art research infrastructure. The &quot;Sixth Higher Education Plan&quot; invests NIS 300 million over six years in upgrading and renovating academic infrastructure and research facilities.

I-CORE is run jointly by the Council for Higher Education&#x27;s Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Israel Science Foundation. By 2015, 16 centres had been established in two waves across a wide spectrum of research areas: six specialize in life sciences and medicine, five in the exact sciences and engineering, three in social sciences and law and two in humanities. Each centre of excellence has been selected via a peer review process conducted by the Israel Science Foundation. By May 2014, around 60 young researchers had been absorbed into these centres, many of whom had previously worked abroad.

The research topics of each centre are selected through a broad bottom-up process consisting of consultations with the Israeli academic community, in order to ensure that they reflect the genuine priorities and scientific interests of Israeli researchers.

I-CORE is funded by the Council for Higher Education, the host institutions and strategic business partners, with a total budget of NIS 1.35 billion (US$365 million). The original goal was to set up 30 centres of research excellence in Israel by 2016. However, the establishment of the remaining 14 centres has provisionally been shelved, for lack of sufficient external capital.

In 2013–2014, the Planning and Budgeting Committee&#x27;s budget for the entire I-CORE programme amounted to NIS 87.9 million, equivalent to about 1% of the total for higher education that year. This budget appears to be insufficient to create the critical mass of researchers in various academic fields and thus falls short of the programme&#x27;s objective. The level of government support for the centres of excellence has grown each year since 2011 as new centres have been established and is expected to reach NIS 93.6 million by 2015–2016 before dropping to 33.7 million in 2017–2018. According to the funding model, government support should represent one-third of all funding, another third being funded by the participating universities and the remaining third by donors or investors.

=== University recruitment targets ===
In the 2012–2013 academic year, there were 4,066 faculty members. The targets fixed by the Planning and Budgeting Committee for faculty recruitment are ambitious: universities are to recruit another 1 600 senior faculty within the six-year period – about half of whom will occupy new positions and half will replace faculty expected to retire. This will constitute a net increase of more than 15% in university faculty. In colleges, another 400 new positions are to be created, entailing a 25% net increase. The new faculty will be hired via the institutions’ regular recruitment channels, some in specific research areas, through the Israeli Centers of Research Excellence program.

The increase in faculty numbers will also reduce the student-to-faculty ratio, the target being to achieve a ratio of 21.5 university students to every faculty member, compared to 24.3 at present, and 35 students for every faculty member in colleges, compared to 38 at present. This increase in the number of faculty positions, alongside the upgrading of research and teaching infrastructure and the increase in competitive research funds, should help Israel to staunch brain drain by enabling the best Israeli researchers at home and abroad to conduct their academic work in Israel, if they so wish, at institutions offering the highest academic standards.

The new budgeting scheme described above is mainly concerned with the human and research infrastructure in universities. Most of the physical development (e.g. buildings) and scientific infrastructure (e.g. laboratories and expensive equipment) of universities comes from philanthropic donations, primarily from the American Jewish community (CHE, 2014). This latter source of funding has greatly compensated for the lack of sufficient government funding for universities up until now but it is expected to diminish significantly in the years to come. Unless the government invests more in research infrastructure, Israel&#x27;s universities will be ill-equipped and insufficiently funded to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

=== Expanding access to higher education ===
Israel has offered virtually universal access to its universities and academic colleges since the wave of Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s prompted the establishment of numerous tertiary institutions to absorb the additional demand. However, the Arab and ultra-orthodox minorities still attend university in insufficient numbers. The &quot;Sixth Higher Education Plan&quot; places emphasis on encouraging minority groups to enroll in higher education. Two years after the &quot;Mahar&quot; program was implemented in late 2012 for the ultra-orthodox population, student enrollment had grown by 1400. Twelve new programs for ultra-orthodox students have since been established, three of them on university campuses. Meanwhile, the Pluralism and Equal Opportunity in Higher Education program addresses the barriers to integration of the Arab minority in the higher education system. Its scope ranges from providing secondary-school guidance through preparation for academic studies to offering students comprehensive support in their first year of study, a stage normally characterized by a high drop-out rate. The program renews the &quot;Ma’of&quot; fund supporting outstanding young Arab faculty members. Since the introduction of this program in 1995, the &quot;Ma’of&quot; fund has opened tenure track opportunities for nearly 100 Arab lecturers, who act as role models for younger Arab students embarking on their own academic careers.

== Science, technology and innovation policy ==

=== Policy framework ===
Although Israel does not have an ‘umbrella type’ policy for science, technology and innovation optimizing priorities and allocating resources, it does implement, &quot;de facto&quot;, an undeclared set of best practices combining bottom-up and top-down processes via government offices, such as those of the Chief Scientist or the Minister of Science, Technology and Space, as well as ad hoc organizations like the Telem forum. The procedure for selecting research projects for the Israeli centers for research excellence is one example of this bottom-up process.

Israel has no specific legislation regulating the transfer of knowledge from the academic sector to the general public and industry. Nevertheless, the Israeli government influences policy formulation by universities and technology transfer by providing incentives and subsidies through programmes such as Magnet and Magneton, as well as through regulation. There were attempts in 2004 and 2005 to introduce bills encouraging the transfer of knowledge and technology for the public benefit but, as these attempts failed, each university has since defined its own policy.

The Israeli economy is driven by industries based on electronics, computers and communication technologies, the result of over 50 years of investment in the country&#x27;s defence infrastructure. Israeli defence industries have traditionally focused on electronics, avionics and related systems. The development of these systems has given Israeli high-tech industries a qualitative edge in civilian spin-offs in the software, communications and Internet sectors. However, the next waves of high technologies are expected to emanate from other disciplines, including molecular biology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, material sciences and chemistry, in intimate synergy with information and communication technologies. These disciplines are rooted in the basic research laboratories of universities rather than the defence industries. This poses a dilemma. In the absence of a national policy for universities, let alone for the higher education system as a whole, it is not clear how these institutions will manage to supply the knowledge, skills and human resources needed for these new science-based industries.

=== Evaluation of science policy instruments ===
The country&#x27;s various policy instruments are evaluated by the Council for Higher Education, the National Council for Research and Development, the Office of the Chief Scientist, the Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Ministry of Finance. In recent years, the Magnet administration in the Office of the Chief Scientist has initiated several evaluations of its own policy instruments, most of which have been carried out by independent research institutions. One such evaluation was carried out in 2010 by the Samuel Neaman Institute; it concerned the Nofar programme within the Magnet directorate. Nofar tries to bridge basic and applied research, before the commercial potential of a project has caught the eye of industry. The main recommendation was for Nofar to extend programme funding to emerging technological domains beyond biotechnology and nanotechnology. The Office of the Chief Scientist accepted this recommendation and, consequently, decided to fund projects in the fields of medical devices, water and energy technology and multidisciplinary research.

An additional evaluation was carried out in 2008 by Applied Economics, an economic and management research-based consultancy, on the contribution of the high-tech sector to economic productivity in Israel. It found that the output per worker in companies that received support from the Office of the Chief Scientist was 19% higher than in ‘twin’ companies that had not received this support. The same year, a committee headed by Israel Makov examined the Office of the Chief Scientist&#x27;s support for research and development in large companies. The committee found economic justification for providing incentives for these companies.

=== Research funding programmes ===
The Israeli Science Foundation is the main source of research funding in Israel and receives administrative support from the Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The foundation provides competitive grants in three areas: exact sciences and technology; life sciences and medicine; and humanities and social sciences. Complementary funding is provided by binational foundations, such as the USA–Israel Binational Science Foundation (est. 1972) and the German–Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development (est. 1986).

The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space funds thematic research centres and is responsible for international scientific co-operation. The Ministry&#x27;s National Infrastructure Programme aims to create a critical mass of knowledge in national priority fields and to nurture the younger generation of scientists. Investment in the programme mainly takes the form of research grants, scholarships and knowledge centres. Over 80% of the ministry&#x27;s budget is channelled towards research in academic institutions and research institutes, as well as towards revamping scientific infrastructure by upgrading existing research facilities and establishing new ones. In 2012, the ministry resolved to invest NIS 120 million over three years in four designated priority areas for research: brain science; supercomputing and cybersecurity; oceanography; and alternative transportation fuels. An expert panel headed by the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space chose these four broad disciplines in the belief that they would be likely to exert the greatest practical impact on Israeli life in the near future.

The main ongoing programmes managed by the Israel Innovation Authority, Previously known as the Office of the Chief Scientist within the Ministry of the Economy are: the R&amp;D (Research and Development) Fund; Magnet Tracks (est. 1994; Tnufa (est. 2001) and the Technological Incubator Programme (est.1991). Between 2010 and 2014, the Office of the Chief Scientist initiated several new programmes:
* Grand Challenges Israel (since 2014): an Israeli contribution to the Grand Challenges in Global Health programme, which is dedicated to tackling global health and food security challenges in developing countries; Grand Challenges Israel is offering grants of up to NIS 500 000 at the proof of concept/feasibility study stage.
* Research and development in the field of space technology (2012): encourages research to find technological solutions in various fields.
* Technological Entrepreneurship Incubators (2014): encourages entrepreneurial technology and supports start-up technology companies.
* Magnet – Kamin programme (2014) provides direct support for applied research in academia that has potential for commercial application.
* Cyber – Kidma programme (2014): promotes Israel&#x27;s cybersecurity industry.
* Cleantech – Renewable Energy Technology Centre (2012): supports research through projects involving private–public partnerships in the field of renewable energy.
* Life Sciences Fund (2010): finances the projects of Israeli companies, with emphasis on biopharmaceuticals, established together with the Ministry of Finance and the private sector.
* Biotechnology – Tzatam programme (2011): provides equipment to support research and development in life sciences. The Chief Scientist supports industrial organizations and the PBC provides research institutions with assistance.
* Investment in high-tech industries (2011): encourages financial institutions to invest in knowledge-based industries, through a collaboration between the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Ministry of Finance.
Another source of public research funding is the Forum for National Research and Development Infrastructure (Telem). This voluntary partnership involves the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space, the Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Ministry of Finance. Telem projects focus on establishing infrastructure for research and development in areas that are of common interest to most Telem partners. These projects are financed by the Telem members’ own resources.

=== Trends in research funding ===
In 2014, Israel topped the world for research  intensity, reflecting the importance of research and innovation for the economy. Since 2008, however, Israel&#x27;s research intensity has weakened somewhat (4.21% of GDP in 2013), even as this ratio has experienced impressive growth in the Republic of Korea (4.15% in 2014), Denmark (3.06% in 2013) and Germany (2.94% in 2013). The OECD average was 2.40% of GDP in 2014. Business expenditure on research and development (BERD) continues to account for ~84% of GERD, or 3.49% of GDP.

The share of higher education in gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD) has decreased since 2003 from 0.69% of GDP to 0.59% of GDP (2013). Despite this drop, Israel ranks 8th among OECD countries for this indicator. The lion&#x27;s share of GERD (45.6%) in Israel is financed by foreign companies, reflecting the large scale of activity by foreign multinational companies and research centres in the country.

The share of foreign funding in university-performed research is also quite significant (21.8%). By the end of 2014, Israel had received €875.6 million from the European Union&#x27;s (EU&#x27;s) Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2007–2013), 70% of which had gone to universities. Its successor, Horizon 2020 (2014–2020), has been endowed with nearly €80 billion in funding, making it the EU&#x27;s most ambitious research and innovation programme ever. As of February 2015, Israel had received €119.8 million from the Horizon 2020 programme.

In 2013, more than half (51.5%) of government spending was allocated to university research and an additional 29.9% to the development of industrial technologies. Research expenditure on health and the environment has doubled in absolute terms in the past decade but still accounts for less than 1% of total government GERD. Israel is unique among OECD countries in its distribution of government support by objective. Israel ranks at the bottom in government support of research in health care, environmental quality and infrastructure development.

There has been insufficient government funding for universities in recent years. University research in Israel is largely grounded in basic research, even though it also engages in applied research and partnerships with industry. Basic research in Israel only accounted for 13% of research expenditure in 2013, compared to 16% in 2006. There has since been an increase in General University Funds and those destined for non-oriented research.

=== Trends in human resources ===
In 2012, there were 77 282 full-time equivalent researchers in Israel, 82% of whom had acquired an academic education, 10% of whom were practical engineers and technicians and 8% of whom held other qualifications. Eight out of ten (83.8%) were employed in the business sector, 1.1% in the government sector, 14.4% in the higher education sector and 0.7% in non-profit institutions.

In 2011, 28% of senior academic staff were women, up by 5% over the previous decade (from 25% in 2005). Although the representation of women has increased, it remains very low in engineering (14%), physical sciences (11%), mathematics and computer sciences (10%) relative to education (52%) and paramedical occupations (63%).

There is a visible ageing of scientists and engineers in some fields. For instance, about three-quarters of researchers in the physical sciences are over the age of 50 and the proportion is even higher for practical engineers and technicians. The shortage of professional staff will be a major handicap for the national innovation system in the coming years, as the growing demand for engineers and technical professionals begins to outpace supply. 

During the 2012/2013 academic year, 34% of bachelor&#x27;s degrees were obtained in fields related to science and engineering in Israel. This compares well with the proportion in the Republic of Korea (40%) and most Western countries (about 30% on average). The proportion of Israeli graduates in scientific disciplines and engineering was slightly lower at the master&#x27;s level (27%) but dominated at PhD level (56%).

Recent statistics support the assertion that Israel may be living on the ‘fruits of the past’, that is to say, on the heavy investment made in primary, secondary and tertiary education during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Between 2007 and 2013, the number of graduates in physical sciences, biological sciences and agriculture dropped, even though the total number of university graduates progressed by 19% (to 39 654). Recent data reveal that Israeli educational achievements in the core curricular subjects of mathematics and science are low in comparison to other OECD countries, as revealed by the exam results of Israeli 15-year-olds in the OECD&#x27;s Programme for International Student Assessment. Public spending on primary education has also fallen below the OECD average. The public education budget accounted for 6.9% of GDP in 2002 but only 5.6% in 2011. The share of this budget going to tertiary education has remained stable at 16–18% but, as a share of GDP, has passed under the bar of 1%. There is concern at the deteriorating quality of teachers at all levels of education and the lack of stringent demands on students to strive for excellence.

In recent years, Israel encountered the problem of shortage of specialists in the high-tech industry. Now high technology sector is rapidly growing and demand for tech talent increasing as well - the further growth of the industry depends on it. The shortage also generates a significant and disproportionate increase in salaries, which causes companies to look for new employees abroad. To solve the problem Israel&#x27;s Council for Higher Education has already launched a five-years program to increase the number of graduates from computer science and engineering programs by 40%.

== Digital technologies ==
Israel is investing heavily in technologies such as AI and data science, smart mobility, digital health and e-governance through Digital Israel, a series of national programmes that include the Fuel Choices and Smart Mobility Initiative.

Digital Israel is the concrete expression of the government’s &quot;Digital Policy&quot; for 2017–2022. This NIS 1.5 billion (about US$ 425 million) initiative aims to make Israel a global leader in this domain. The programme plans to leverage Israeli expertise in information and communication technologies (ICTs) to accelerate economic growth, reduce socio-economic disparities and make governance smarter, faster and citizen-friendlier.

The programme is led by the Headquarters for the National Digital Israel Initiative, placed under the Ministry of Social Equality; this body collaborates with ministries, local authorities, companies and non-profit organizations.

In 2018, Israel embarked on a five-year National Programme for Digital Health. The stated aims are to create a new national economic growth engine, advance Israel’s clinical and academic research and create a local digital health care system that is among the best in the world. The programme is backed by an investment of NIS 898 million (ca US$ 256 million) and implemented by multiple governmental bodies, including the Ministry of Health, the Ministry for Social Equality (Digital Israel), the Ministry of the Economy and Industry, the Israeli Innovation Authority and the Council for Higher Education.

== Research universities ==
Israel has seven research universities: Bar-Ilan University, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, the University of Haifa, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Tel Aviv University and the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot. Other scientific research institutions include the Volcani Institute of Agricultural Research in Beit Dagan, the Israel Institute for Biological Research and the Soreq Nuclear Research Center. The Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Center at Sde Boker is an alternative energy research institute established in 1987 by the Ministry of National Infrastructures to study alternative and clean energy technologies.

Israeli universities are ranked among the top 50 academic institutions in the world in the following scientific disciplines: in chemistry (Technion); in computer science (Weizmann Institute of Science, Technion, Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University); in mathematics and natural sciences (Hebrew University, Technion) and in engineering (Technion).

In 2009, Mor Tzaban, an Israeli high school student from Netivot, won first prize in the First Step to Nobel Prize in Physics competition. In 2012, Yuval Katzenelson of Kiryat Gat won first prize with a paper entitled &quot;Kinetic energy of inert gas in a regenerative system of activated carbon.&quot; The Israeli delegation won 14 more prizes in the competition: 9 Israelis students won second prize, one won third prize and one won fourth prize.

== Research and Development center ==
Except universities, Israel has seven R&amp;D centers in the periphery. These centers were established by the Ministry of Science and Technology, and include Migal and the Dead Sea and Arava science center. Their orientation is based on applied science and the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the general population. To date, seven centers are working with significant academic impact and relevance to the region.

== Scientific output ==
The number of Israeli publications stagnated between 2005 and 2014, according to Thomson Reuters&#x27; Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Consequently, the number of Israeli publications per million inhabitants also declined: between 2008 and 2013, it dropped from 1 488 to 1 431; this trend reflects a relative constancy in scholarly output in the face of relatively high population growth (1.1% in 2014) for a developed country and near-zero growth in the number of full-time equivalent researchers in universities. Between 2005 and 2014, Israeli scientific output was particularly high in life sciences. Israeli universities do particularly well in computer science but publications in this field tend to appear mostly in conference proceedings, which are not included in the Web of Science.

Israeli publications have a high citation rate and a high share of papers count among the 10 percent most-cited. The share of papers with foreign co-authors is almost twice the OECD average, which is typical of small countries with a developed scientific and technological ecosystem. A team of 50 Israeli scientists work full-time at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which operates the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Israel was granted observer status in 1991 before becoming a fully fledged member in 2014. An Israeli delegation headed by President Shimon Peres visited the particle accelerator in 2011.

Israeli scientists collaborate mostly with Western countries such as the European Union and the United States but there has been strong growth in recent years in collaboration with East Asian countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea, India, and the Southeast Asian city state of Singapore.

== Technology transfer ==

=== History ===
Research conducted at Israeli universities and institutes is shared with the private sector through technology transfer (TT) units. Israel&#x27;s first university TT unit, Yeda, was established by the Weizmann Institute of Science in the 1950s. Research in such fields as arid and semi-arid zone agricultural engineering was transferred to kibbutzim and private farmers on a gratis basis and agricultural knowledge was shared with developing countries.

In 1964, Yissum, the technology transfer company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, was founded.

Since the 1990s, the traditional dual mission of universities of teaching and research has broadened to include a third mission: engagement with society and industry. This evolution has been a corollary of the rise of the electronics industry and information technology services, along with a surge in the number of research personnel following the wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union.

Israel has no specific legislation regulating the transfer of knowledge from the academic sector to the general public and industry. There were attempts in 2004 and 2005 to introduce bills encouraging the transfer of knowledge and technology for the public benefit but, as these attempts failed, each university has since defined its own policy.

=== University-industry collaboration ===
All Israeli research universities have technology transfer offices. Recent research conducted by the Samuel Neaman Institute has revealed that, between 2004 and 2013, the universities’ share of patent applications constituted 10–12% of the total inventive activity of Israeli applicants. This is one of the highest shares in the world and is largely due to the intensive activity of the universities’ technology transfer offices. The Weizmann Institute&#x27;s technology transfer office, Yeda, has been ranked the third-most profitable in the world. Through exemplary university–industry collaboration, the Weizmann Institute of Science and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries have discovered and developed the Copaxone drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Copaxone is Teva&#x27;s biggest-selling drug, with US$1.68 billion in sales in the first half of 2011. Since the drug&#x27;s approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1996, it is estimated that the Weizmann Institute of Science has earned nearly US$2 billion in royalties from the commercialization of its intellectual property.

=== International technology transfer ===
In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s Economic and Financial Committee adopted an Israeli-sponsored draft resolution on agricultural technology transfer to developing countries. The resolution called on developed countries to make their knowledge and know-how accessible to the developing world as part of the UN campaign to eradicate hunger and dire poverty by 2015. The initiative is an outgrowth of Israel&#x27;s many years of contributing its know-how to developing nations, especially Africa, in the spheres of agriculture, fighting desertification, rural development, irrigation, medical development, computers and the empowerment of women.

== Venture capital ==
As new technology companies require money and seed capital to grow and thrive, Israel&#x27;s science and technology sector is backed by a strong venture capital industry. Between 2004 and 2013, the Israeli venture capital industry played a fundamental role in funding the development of Israel&#x27;s high-tech sector. In 2013, Israeli companies had raised more venture capital as a share of GDP than companies in any other country as it attracted US$2 346 million alone during that year. Today, Israel is considered one of the biggest venture capital centers in the world outside the United States of America. Several factors have contributed to this growth. These include tax exemptions on Israeli venture capital, funds established in conjunction with large international banks and financial companies and the involvement of major organizations desirous to capitalize on the strengths of Israeli high-tech companies. These organizations include some of the world&#x27;s largest multinational technology companies, including Apple, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Siemens and Samsung. In recent years, the share of venture capital invested in the growth stages of enterprises has flourished at the expense of early stage investments. Nowadays, Israeli companies are considered to be more popular than their American peers. For comparison, investments volume in Israeli startups grew by 140% during 2014-2018 and investments in technological startups from the U.S. grew by 64%.

Israel&#x27;s venture capital market backed deals worth US$ 4 759 million in 2018. About half of venture capital-backed deals involved an Israeli venture capitalist, either working solo or with others. According to the IVC database, 480 Israeli venture capital companies invested in Israeli high-tech firms in 2018 and 2019.

For most OECD countries, venture capital constitutes less than 0.05% of GDP. Israel and the USA are the exception; their venture capital industry accounts for more than 0.35% of GDP.

== Intellectual property rights ==
Intellectual property rights in Israel protect copyright and performers’ rights, trademarks, geographical indicators, patents, industrial designs, topographies of integrated circuits, plant breeds and undisclosed business secrets. Both contemporary Israeli legislation and case law are influenced by laws and practices in modern countries, particularly Anglo-American law, the emerging body of EU law and proposals by international organizations.

Israel has made a concerted effort to improve the economy&#x27;s ability to benefit from an enhanced system of intellectual property rights. This includes increasing the resources of the Israel Patent Office, upgrading enforcement activities and implementing programmes to bring ideas funded by government research to the market. Between 2002 and 2012, foreigners accounted for nearly 80% of the patent applications filed with the Israel Patent Office. A sizeable share of foreign applicants seeking protection from the Israel Patent Office are pharmaceutical companies such as F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Janssen, Novartis, Merck, Bayer-Schering, Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer, which happen to be the main business competitors of Israel&#x27;s own Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.

Israel ranks tenth in the world for the number of patent applications filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) by country of residence of the first-named inventor. Israeli inventors file far more applications with USPTO (5 436 in 2011) than with the European Patent Office (EPO). Moreover, the number of Israeli filings with EPO dropped from 1400 to 1063 between 2006 and 2011. This preference for USPTO is largely because foreign research centres implanted in Israel are primarily owned by US firms such as IBM, Intel, Sandisk, Microsoft, Applied Materials, Qualcomm, Motorola, Google or Hewlett–Packard. The inventions of these companies are attributed to Israel as the inventor of the patent but not as the owner (applicant or assignee). The loss of intellectual property into the hands of multinationals occurs mainly through the recruitment of the best Israeli talent by the local research centres of multinational firms. Although the Israeli economy benefits from the activity of the multinationals’ subsidiaries through job creation and other means, the advantages are relatively small compared to the potential economic gains that might have been achieved, had this intellectual property been utilized to support and foster the expansion of mature Israeli companies of a considerable size.

== Applied science and engineering ==

=== Energy ===

==== Solar power ====
As of 2014, Israel leads the 2014 Global Cleantech Innovation Index.
The country&#x27;s lack of conventional energy sources has spurred extensive research and development of alternative energy sources and Israel has developed innovative technologies in the solar energy field. Israel has become the world&#x27;s largest per capita user of solar water heaters in the home. A new, high-efficiency receiver to collect concentrated sunlight has been developed, which will enhance the use of solar energy in industry as well.

In a 2009 report by the CleanTech Group, Israel ranked number 5 clean tech country in the world. The Arrow Ecology company has developed the ArrowBio process a patented system which takes trash directly from collection trucks and separates organic and inorganic materials through gravitational settling, screening, and hydro-mechanical shredding. The system is capable of sorting huge volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into biogas and rich agricultural compost. The system is used in California, Australia, Greece, Mexico, the United Kingdom and in Israel. For example, an ArrowBio plant that has been operational at the Hiriya landfill site since December 2003 serves the Tel Aviv area, and processes up to 150 tons of garbage a day.

In 2010, Technion – the Israel Institute of Technology – established the Grand Technion Energy Program (GTEP). This multidisciplinary task-force brings together Technion&#x27;s top researchers in energy science and technology from over nine different faculties. GTEP&#x27;s 4-point strategy targets research and development of alternative fuels; renewable energy sources; energy storage and conversion; and energy conservation. GTEP is presently the only center in Israel offering graduate studies in energy science and technology to bring the energy skills and know-how to address the energy challenges of the future.

==== Natural gas ====
Since 1999, large reserves of natural gas have been discovered off Israel&#x27;s coast. This fossil fuel has become the primary fuel for electricity generation in Israel and is gradually replacing oil and coal.  In 2010, 37% of electricity in Israel was generated from natural gas, leading to savings of US$1.4 billion for the economy. In 2015, this rate is expected to surpass 55%.

In addition, the usage of natural gas in industry – both as a source of energy and as a raw material – is rapidly expanding, alongside the requisite infrastructure. This is giving companies a competitive advantage by reducing their energy costs and lowering national emissions. Since early 2013, almost the entire natural gas consumption of Israel has been supplied by the Tamar field, an Israeli–American private partnership. The estimated reserves amount to about 1 000 BCM, securing Israel&#x27;s energy needs for many decades to come and making Israel a potentially major regional exporter of natural gas. In 2014, initial export agreements were signed with the Palestinian Authority, Jordan and Egypt; there are also plans to export natural gas to Turkey and the EU via Greece.

In 2011, the government asked the Academy of Sciences and Humanities to convene a panel of experts to consider the full range of implications of the most recent discoveries of natural gas. The panel recommended encouraging research into fossil fuels, training engineers and focusing research efforts on the impact of gas production on the Mediterranean Sea&#x27;s ecosystem. The Mediterranean Sea Research Centre of Israel was established in 2012 with an initial budget of NIS 70 million; new study programmes have since been launched at the centre to train engineers and other professionals for the oil and gas industry. Meanwhile, the Office of the Chief Scientist, among others, plans to use Israel&#x27;s fledgling natural gas industry as a stepping stone to building capacity in advanced technology and opening up opportunities for Israeli innovation targeting the global oil and gas markets.

=== Space science and technology ===
During the 1970s and 1980s Israel began developing the infrastructure needed for research and development in space exploration and related sciences. In November 1982, the Minister of Science and Technology, Yuval Ne&#x27;eman, established the Israel Space Agency (ISA), to coordinate and supervise a national space program as well as to conduct space, planetary, and aviation research. Because of geographical constraints, as well as safety considerations, the Israeli space program focuses on very small satellites loaded with payloads of a high degree of sophistication, and cooperation with other national space agencies. The Technion Asher Space Research Institute plays a central role in educating the aerospace engineers of the next generation. In 2009 Israel was ranked 2nd among 20 top countries in space sciences by Thomson Reuters agency.

Israel became the eighth nation in the world to have an orbital launch capability when it deployed its first satellite, Ofeq-1, using the locally built Shavit launch vehicle on September 19, 1988, and has made contributions in a number of areas in space research, including laser communication, research into embryo development and osteoporosis in space, pollution monitoring, and mapping geology, soil and vegetation in semi-arid environments.

Key projects include the TAUVEX telescope, the Tel Aviv University Ultra Violet Experiment, a UV telescope for astronomical observations which was developed in the 1990s to be accommodated on an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) geo-synchronous satellite GSAT-4, for joint operation and use by Indian and Israeli scientists; the VENUS microsatellite, developed in collaboration with the French space agency, CNES, which will use an Israeli-developed space camera, electric space engine and algorithms; and MEIDEX (Mediterranean – Israel Dust Experiment), in collaboration with NASA.

Ilan Ramon was Israel&#x27;s first astronaut. Ramon was the Space Shuttle payload specialist on board the fatal STS-107 mission of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, in which he and the six other crew members were killed in a re-entry accident over the southern United States. Ramon had been selected as a payload specialist in 1997 and trained at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, from 1998 until 2003. Among other experiments, Ramon was responsible for the MEIDEX project in which he was required to take pictures of atmospheric aerosol (dust) in the Mediterranean area using a multispectral camera designed to provide scientific information about atmospheric aerosols and the influence of global changes on the climate, and data for the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. Researchers from Tel Aviv University (TAU) were responsible for the scientific aspect of the experiment. The TAU team also worked with a US company, Orbital Sciences Corporation, to construct and test special flight instruments for the project.

=== Aerospace engineering ===

Aerospace engineering related to the country&#x27;s defense needs has generated technological development with consequent civilian spin-offs. The Arava short take-off and landing (STOL) plane manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries was 
the first aircraft to be produced in Israel, in the late 1960s, for both military and civilian uses. This was followed by the production of the Westwind business jet from 1965 to 1987, and later variants, the Astra and the Gulfstream G100, which are still in active service.

Israel is among the few countries capable of launching satellites into orbit and locally designed and manufactured satellites have been produced and launched by Israel Aerospace Industries(IAI), Israel&#x27;s largest military engineering company, in cooperation with the Israel Space Agency. The AMOS-1 geostationary satellite began operations in 1996 as Israel&#x27;s first commercial communications satellite. It was built primarily for direct-to-home television broadcasting, TV distribution and VSAT services. AMOS-2 was launched in December 2003 and a further series of AMOS communications satellites (AMOS 2 – 5i) are operated or in development by the Spacecom Satellite Communications company, headquartered in Ramat-Gan, Israel. Spacecom provides satellite telecommunications services to countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Another satellite, the Gurwin-II TechSAT, designed and manufactured by the Technion, was launched in July 1998 to provide communications, remote sensing and research services. EROS, launched in 2000, is a non-geostationary orbit satellite for commercial photography and surveillance services.

Israel also develops, manufactures, and exports a large number of related aerospace products, including rockets and satellites, display systems, aeronautical computers, instrumentation systems, drones and flight simulators. Israel&#x27;s second largest defense company is Elbit Systems, which makes electro-optical systems for air, sea and ground forces; drones; control and monitoring systems; communications systems and more. The Technion - Israel Institute of Technology is home to the Asher Space Research Institute, which is unique in Israel as a university-based center of space research. At ASRI, Israeli students designed, built and launched their own satellite: Gurwin TechSat.

=== Agricultural engineering ===
Israel&#x27;s agricultural sector is characterized by an intensive system of production stemming from the need to overcome the scarcity in natural resource, particularly water and arable land, in a country where more than half of its area is desert. The growth in agricultural production is based on close cooperation of scientists, farmers and agriculture-related industries and has resulted in the development of advanced agricultural technology, water-conserving irrigation methods, anaerobic digestion, greenhouse technology, desert agriculture and salinity research. Israeli companies also supply irrigation, water conservation and greenhouse technologies and know-how to other countries.

The modern technology of drip irrigation was invented in Israel by Simcha Blass and his son Yeshayahu. Instead of releasing water through tiny holes, blocked easily by tiny particles, water was released through larger and longer passageways by using velocity to slow water inside a plastic emitter. The first experimental system of this type was established in 1959 when Blass partnered with Kibbutz Hatzerim to create an irrigation company called Netafim. Together they developed and patented the first practical surface drip irrigation emitter. This method was very successful and had spread to Australia, North America and South America by the late 1960s.

Israeli farmers rely heavily on greenhouse technology to ensure a constant, year-round supply of high quality produce, while overcoming the obstacles posed by adverse climatic conditions, and water and land shortages. Technologies include computerized greenhouse climate control, greenhouse shading, irrigation, fertigation, greenhouse water recycling and biological control of plant disease and insects, allow farmers to control most production parameters. As a result, Israeli farmers successfully grow 3 million roses per hectare in season and an average of 300 tons of tomatoes per hectare, four times the amount harvested in open fields.

=== Computer engineering ===
Israeli companies excel in computer software and hardware development, particularly computer security technologies, semiconductors and communications. Israeli firms include Check Point, the creators of the first commercial firewall; Amdocs, which makes business and operations support systems for telecoms; Comverse, a voice-mail company; and Mercury Interactive, which measures software performance. A high concentration of high-tech industries in the coastal plain of Israel has led to the nickname Silicon Wadi (lit: &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;). Both Israeli and international companies are based there. Intel, Microsoft, and Apple built their first overseas research and development centers in Israel, and other high-tech multi-national corporations, such as IBM, Cisco Systems, and Motorola, have opened facilities in the country. Intel developed its dual-core Core Duo processor at its Israel Development Center in Haifa. More than 3,850 start-ups have been established in Israel, making it second only to the US in this sector and has the largest number of NASDAQ-listed companies outside North America.

Optics, electro-optics, and lasers are significant fields and Israel produces fiber-optics, electro-optic inspection systems for printed circuit boards, thermal imaging night-vision systems, and electro-optics-based robotic manufacturing systems. Research into robotics first began in the late 1970s, has resulted in the production of robots designed to perform a wide variety of computer aided manufacturing tasks, including diamond polishing, welding, packing, and building. Research is also conducted in the application of artificial intelligence to robots.

Israel&#x27;s Weizmann Institute of Science and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology are ranked among the top 20 academic institutions in the world in computer science. An Israeli electronics engineer and businessman who was the founder, chief executive officer, and president of M-Systems, Dov Moran, invented the first flash drive in 1998.

==== Cybersecurity ====
In November 2010, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu entrusted a task force with responsibility for formulating national plans to place Israel among the top five countries in the world for cybersecurity. On 7 August 2011, the government approved the establishment of the National Cyber Bureau to promote the Israeli cyberdefence industry. The bureau is based in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. The National Cyber Bureau allocated NIS 180 million (&quot;circa&quot; US$50 million) over 2012–2014 to encourage cyber research and dual military–civilian R&amp;D; the funding is also being used to develop human capital, including through the creation of cybersecurity centres at Israeli universities that are funded jointly by the National Cyber Bureau and the universities themselves.

In January 2014, the prime minister launched CyberSpark, Israel&#x27;s cyber innovation park, as part of plans to turn Israel into a global cyber hub. Located in the city of Beer-Sheva to foster economic development in southern Israel, CyberSpark is a geographical cluster of leading cyber companies, multinational corporations and universities, involving Ben Gurion University of the Negev, technology defence units, specialized educational platforms and the national Cyber Event Readiness Team.

About half of the firms in CyberSpark are Israeli, mostly small to medium-sized. Multinational companies operating in CyberSpark include EMC2, IBM, Lockheed Martin and Deutsche Telekom. PayPal recently acquired the Israeli start-up CyActive and has since announced plans to set up its second Israeli research centre in CyberSpark, with a focus on cybersecurity. This acquisition is just one of the many Israeli cybersecurity start-ups acquired by multinational companies in the past few years. Major acquisitions of Israeli start-ups in 2014 include Intellinx, purchased by Bottomline Technologies, and Cyvera, purchased by Palo Alto Networks.

The National Cyber Bureau has estimated that the number of Israeli cyberdefence companies had doubled in the past five years to about 300 by 2014. Israeli companies account for an estimated 10% of global sales, which currently total an estimated US$60 billion. Total research spending on cyberdefence in Israel quadrupled between 2010 and 2014 from US$50 million to US$200 million, bringing Israel&#x27;s spending to about 15% of global research spending on cyberdefence in 2014. Cybersecurity technologies are exported by Israel in accordance with the Wassenaar Arrangement, a multilateral agreement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies.

The Israeli cyber-intelligence firm, NSO Group Technologies had reportedly been selling its Pegasus spyware to the UAE, Saudi Arabia and other repressive Gulf states, with official mediation of the Israeli government. The software permits law enforcement authorities to hack into cellphones, copy their contents and sometimes even to control their camera and audio recording capabilities. In 2018, a lawsuit was filed against NSO accusing it of secretly helping Saudi Arabia to spy Jamal Khashoggi, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist, later murdered in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. In 2019, WhatsApp sued NSO accusing it of helping government spies in a hacking spree, where they broke into the phones of roughly 1,400 users across 20 countries, targeting diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and senior government officials.

=== Hydraulic engineering ===

Since rain falls only in the winter, and largely in the northern part of the country, irrigation and water engineering is vital to the country&#x27;s economic survival and growth. Large-scale projects to direct water from rivers and reservoirs in the north, to make optimal use of groundwater, and to reclaim flood overflow and sewage have been undertaken. The largest such project was a national water distribution system called the National Carrier, completed in 1964, flowing from the country&#x27;s biggest freshwater lake, the Sea of Galilee, to the northern Negev desert, through huge channels, pipes and tunnels. The Ashkelon seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant was the largest in the world at the time it was built. The project was developed as a BOT (build-operate-transfer) by a consortium of three international companies: Veolia water, IDE Technologies and Elran.

By 2019, desalination provided 70% of domestic and municipal water. The growing volume of desalinated water is creating challenges of its own. Lack of magnesium in the daily diet is associated with heart disease and this condition is becoming more prevalent in Israel in areas where desalinated water is the only source of drinking water, spurring discussion about whether to add magnesium to the water.

==== Water-saving technologies ====
According to water experts, pipe leakage is one of the major problems confronting the global water supply today. For Israel, which is two-thirds desert, water-saving technologies are of critical importance. The International Water Association has cited Israel as one of the leaders in innovative methods to reduce &quot;non-revenue water,&quot; i.e., water lost in the system before reaching the customer.

=== Military engineering ===
Rejection of requests for weapons and technologies, arms sanctions and massive rearmament of the Arab countries prodded Israel into the development of a broad-based indigenous arms industry. The Israel Defense Forces relies heavily on local military technology and high-tech weapons systems designed and manufactured in Israel. Israeli-developed military equipment includes small arms, anti-tank rockets and missiles, boats and submarines, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, unmanned surface vehicles, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), air-defense systems, weapon stations and radar. An impetus for the development of the industry was the embargo on arms sales to Israel during the Six-Day War which prompted Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), founded as a maintenance facility in 1953, to begin developing and assembling its own aircraft, including the Kfir, the Arava and the Nesher.

Notable technology includes the Uzi submachine gun, introduced in 1954, the country&#x27;s main battle tank, the Merkava, and the jointly designed Israeli and U.S. Arrow missile, one of the world&#x27;s only operational, advanced anti-ballistic missile systems. The Iron Dome mobile air defense system developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems is designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells. The system was created as a defensive countermeasure to the rocket threat against Israel&#x27;s civilian population on its northern and southern borders, and was declared operational and initially deployed in the first quarter of 2011. It is designed to intercept very short-range threats up to 70 kilometers in all-weather situations. On April 7, 2011, the system successfully intercepted a Grad rocket launched from Gaza, marking the first time in history a short-range rocket was ever intercepted.

Israel has also developed a network of reconnaissance satellites. The Ofeq (&quot;lit.&quot; Horizon) series (Ofeq 1 – Ofeq 7) were launched between 1988 and 2007. The satellites were carried by Shavit rockets launched from Palmachim Airbase. Both the satellites and the launchers were designed and manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), with Elbit Systems&#x27; El-Op division supplying the optical payload.

Israel also has the first all-around operational active defense system for tanks named Trophy, successfully intercepting anti tank missiles fired at Merkava tanks.

=== Life sciences ===

Israel has an advanced infrastructure of medical and paramedical research and bioengineering capabilities. Biotechnology, biomedical, and clinical research account for over half of the country&#x27;s scientific publications, and the industrial sector has used this extensive knowledge to develop pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and treatment therapies.

====Biotechnology====
Israel has over 900 biotechnology and life sciences companies in operation throughout the country with nearly 50 to 60 formed each year. Many multinational corporations such as J&amp;J, Perrigo, GE Healthcare and Phillips Medical have all established branches in Israel.

==== Genetics and cancer research ====
Israeli scientists have developed methods for producing a human growth hormone and interferon, a group of proteins effective against viral infections. Copaxone, a medicine effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, was developed in Israel from basic research to industrial production. Genetic engineering has resulted in a wide range of diagnostic kits based on monoclonal antibodies, with other microbiological products.

Advanced stem cell research takes place in Israel. The first steps in the development of stem cell studies occurred in Israel, with research in this field dating back to studies of bone marrow stem cells in the early 1960s. By 2006, Israeli scientists were leaders on a per capita basis in the number of articles published in scientific journals related to stem cell research. In 2011, Israeli scientist Inbar Friedrich Ben-Nun led a team which produced the first stem cells from endangered species, a breakthrough that could save animals in danger of extinction. In 2012, Israel was one of the world leaders in stem cell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita.

==== Biomedical engineering ====
Sophisticated medical equipment for both diagnostic and treatment purposes has been developed and marketed worldwide, such as computer tomography (CT) scanners, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, ultrasound scanners, nuclear medical cameras, and surgical lasers. Other innovations include a controlled-release liquid polymer to prevent accumulation of tooth plaque, a device to reduce both benign and malignant swellings of the prostate gland, the use of botulin to correct eye squint, and a miniature camera encased in a swallowable capsule used to diagnose gastrointestinal disease, developed by Given Imaging. MeMic Medical LTD. founded in 2012 received its FDA approval in 2021 for its robotic platform for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) for myomectomy through the vagina.

In 2009, scientists from several European countries and Israel developed a robotic prosthetic hand, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one, allowing patients to write with it, type on a keyboard, play piano and perform other fine movements. The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feeling in its fingertips. A new MRI system for identifying and diagnosing tumors developed at the Weizmann Institute has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is already being used in diagnosing breast and testicular cancer. The new system will replace invasive procedures and eliminate waiting time for the results. 

==== Pharmaceutical sciences====
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, headquartered in Petah Tikva, Israel, is the largest generic drug manufacturer in the world and one of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide. It specializes in generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients and has developed proprietary pharmaceuticals such as Copaxone and Laquinimod for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and Rasagiline for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

=== Quantum technology ===

==== Quantum Computing Center ====
The world&#x27;s first Quantum computing center, located in Tel Aviv, which has several different quantum computers able to hold different quibit modalities was opened in the university of Tel Aviv in June 2024.

== Science and Technology newspapers in Israel ==
NoCamels and CTech are among several Israeli online websites that focus on Israeli innovation, science and technology.

== Nobel Prize laureates ==
Six Israelis have won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. In 2004, biologists Avram Hershko and Aaron Ciechanover of the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology were two of the three winners of the prize, for the discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. In 2009, Ada Yonath was a co-winner of the prize for her studies of the structure and function of the ribosome. She is the first Israeli woman to win a Nobel Prize. Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013 for the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems.

Additionally, 1958 Medicine laureate Joshua Lederberg was born to Israeli Jewish parents, and 2004 Physics laureate David Gross grew up partly in Israel, where he obtained his undergraduate degree. In the social sciences, the Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Daniel Kahneman in 2002, to Robert Aumann of the Hebrew University in 2005, and to Joshua Angrist in 2021.

<text>Wensleydale is a valley in North Yorkshire, England. It is one of the Yorkshire Dales, which are part of the Pennines. The dale is named after the village of Wensley, formerly the valley&#x27;s market town. The principal river of the valley is the Ure, which is the source of the alternative name Yoredale. The majority of the dale is within the Yorkshire Dales National Park; the part below East Witton is within the national landscape of Nidderdale. 

Addlebrough, at , dominates the landscape of the upper dale, and Penhill, at , is prominent in the lower dale. The dale lends its name to the Yoredale Group of Carboniferous rocks. The dale is famous for its cheese, with the main commercial production at Hawes.

==History==

At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, Wensley included two berewicks [a portion of farmland], &quot;one of 4 and another of 3 carucates [units of land area], each attached to Count Alan&#x27;s manor of East Witton&quot;. The Count&#x27;s entire holding in the area included only 11 villagers, 2 smallholders and 18 ploughlands. By 1199, Wensley Church, under the patronship of &quot;Niel son of Alexander&quot;, was in operation.
Wensley became the primary village of the valley, receiving its Royal Charter in 1202; that allowed for the creation of a market. Wensleydale was the home of one of Yorkshire&#x27;s most famous clans, the Metcalfes, after they emigrated from Dentdale. The Metcalfe Society hold records dating back to Metcalfes living in the area during the 14th century. They were one of the most prominent families in Yorkshire for more than five centuries. Sir James Metcalfe (1389–1472), who was born and lived in Wensleydale, was a captain in the army which fought with King Henry V in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. A fortified manor, Nappa Hall near Askrigg, was built by his son Sir Thomas Metcalfe.

During the 16th and 17th century, the primary industries were lead and coal works but limeworks were also common. A 1914 report stated that &quot;old smelting-mills, quarries and limekilns abound; freestone and lime are still worked&quot;. In 1563, the plague reached this area; residents of Wensely who survived settled in Leyburn; &quot;Wensley never fully recovered from that tragedy&quot; and by 1686, Leyburn had become the main settlement and the valley&#x27;s market town.

Bolton Castle, in the village of Castle Bolton, is a notable local historic site. 
Building of the structure was begun by Richard le Scrope, Lord Treasurer and Lord Chancellor to Richard II, in 1378. The building was finally completed in c.1399; the total cost was approximately 18,000 marks. Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned there for six months, ending in January 1569, under head keeper Sir Francis Knollys, housed in the apartment of Henry Scrope; she was allowed a retinue of 51, with 30 housed in the castle. The story goes that she once escaped and made her way towards Leyburn but was captured at a spot on &quot;The Shawl&quot; called &quot;Queen&#x27;s Gap&quot;.

By 1846 the railway had reached Wensleydale, on a line between Northallerton and Bedale; it was extended in 1856, to carry passengers from Leeming Bar to Bedale. Wensley railway station opened in 1877; by 1878, there were also stations in Northallerton, Leeming Bar, Bedale, Leyburn, Hawes and Garsdale.

==Geography==

Wensleydale&#x27;s principal settlements are Hawes and Leyburn; Aysgarth, Bainbridge, and Middleham are well-known villages. The shortest river in England, the River Bain, links Semerwater to the River Ure, at Bainbridge, the home to an Ancient Roman fort (part of the Roman road is walkable, up Wether Fell). Hardraw Force, the highest above-ground unbroken waterfall in England, is located at Hardraw, near Hawes.
Aysgarth Falls (High, Middle, Low) are famous for their beauty (rather than their height), attracting far-off visitors; they were also featured in the film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;. Some scenes from the 1992 film &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; were also filmed at the falls. Other notable waterfalls are at Wensley (Harmby Falls), West Burton, and Whitfield Gill Force, near Askrigg.

Wensleydale stretches some from west to east. It lies between Wharfedale (to the south), and the quieter Swaledale (to the north, via Buttertubs Pass). Several lesser-known dales are branches of Wensleydale: on the north side Cotterdale, Fossdale and Apedale and on the south side, from west to east, Widdale, Sleddale, Raydale, Bishopdale, Waldendale and Coverdale.

Below Wensleydale, the River Ure flows east and south, becomes navigable, changes its name to the River Ouse, passes through York, becomes the Humber Estuary, flows under the Humber Bridge past Hull, Immingham, and Grimsby, and meets the North Sea off Spurn Head. On the way it collects the waters of the River Swale, River Nidd, River Wharfe, River Aire, River Derwent and River Trent.

==Tourism==

Wensleydale is a very popular destination in its own right, enhanced by its central location between two other well-known tourist dales: Wharfedale and the quieter Swaledale. 

Wensleydale is a common destination for visitors who like walking on mountains, moorland, dale-sides, and valley bottoms. Hawes and Leyburn are popular because of their age, location and facilities (pubs, shops, teashops, and hotels). Hawes is the home of rope maker (Outhwaites), where visitors can see the manufacturing process. Hawes
is also home to the Wensleydale Creamery, the Dales Countryside Museum, shops and many of places to eat. Part of Bolton Castle is a ruin but the other section has been restored.

The Wensleydale Railway operates in Wensleydale. It currently runs between Leeming Bar, the A1 and Redmire, near Castle Bolton. The railway&#x27;s long-term plan is eventually to run the whole length of the valley and connect again with the National Rail network at both ends: at Garsdale on the Settle-Carlisle Railway in the west and Northallerton on the East Coast Main Line in the east. It is hoped this may help relieve some of the current traffic congestion that the valley suffers from during the busiest months.

Some visitors come to Wensleydale due to its connection with Richard III, who was brought up in Middleham Castle. It has the largest castle keep in the North of England. Middleham itself is a market town with pubs and horse-racing connections (several stables). In the market place stands a stone carving, believed to be a boar&#x27;s head, signifying where the animal market was during the 15th century as well as representing Richard&#x27;s personal standard, the white boar.

Each August, visitors and local people gather at the edge of Leyburn for the Wensleydale Agricultural Show.

<text>Knights of the Maccabees was a fraternal organization formed in 1878 in London, Ontario, Canada. Most active in the U.S. state of Michigan, the group&#x27;s fraternal aspects took a backseat to providing low-cost insurance to members. In the society&#x27;s early years it also provided other final-expense related benefits such as society cemeteries.

The motto of the Knights of Maccabees was the Latin phrase &quot;Astra Castra Numen Lumen&quot; which means &quot;The stars my camp, the Deity my light&quot;.

==History==

The Knights of the Maccabees was founded in London, Ontario by members of the Order of the Foresters. They based their name, ceremonies and rituals on the Maccabees, a group of Jewish rebels against the Seleucid Empire whose exploits are described in the Books of the Maccabees, considered part of the Biblical canon in Catholicism, but apocryphal in Judaism and Protestant Christianity. The first convention was held on August 7, 1878.

The group grew rapidly in Canada and several US States, reaching 10,000 members by 1880. The organization was not on an actuarially sound basis - no medical exams were required of new members, and assessments of death was 10 cents for each member. As death claims began piling up, the organizations expenses began to outweigh its income. A group of business men in Michigan, where the order had a number of members, endeavored to put the Maccabees on a sound financial basis.

To this end a &quot;grand review&quot; was held in Buffalo, New York in 1880 to reorganize the society, drawing up a new constitution and laws. Major Nathan Boynton was elected the new Supreme Lieutenant Commander. This created a brief schism with the Canadian group seceding under a man named McLaughlin. In 1881 a meeting of the two factions representatives met at Port Huron, Michigan, and they agreed to reconcile their differences. A committee was appointed, chaired by Boynton, to draft a new constitution acceptable to both factions, and this was agreed to in February 1881.

Under the new constitution, Great Camps could be formed in states or provinces with more than 1,000 members and the Supreme Tent (overall organization) operated the beneficiary aspect of the organization. The Great Camp of Michigan was incorporated in that state on June 11, 1881, which was considered the foundation date of the reorganized order. Organizational stability remained elusive. At the Supreme Tent in July 1881 the Michigan delegates obtained an amendment to allow individual Great Camps to establish their own beneficiary programs, anticipating that the national organization would become defunct. By 1882, the order had indeed become dormant outside of Michigan, and Boynton became Great Record Keeper and then Great Commander of the state. The Supreme Tent was then revived, again, in September 1883.

In 1914 the organization changed its name from the Knights of the Maccabees to simply The Maccabees. In terms of finances and benefits, the Maccabees adopted the National Fraternal Congress Tables in 1911 and the American Mortuary Table of Rates in 1920. A &quot;Supreme Review&quot; conducted in 1958, the Macabees became a mutual life insurance company effective 1961, though still kept some fraternal features.

Organizationally, the group suffered a split in 1905, when a group called the Western Bees seceded in 1905. This group eventually merged with the Highland Nobles in 1911. In the 1930s the Maccabees began absorbing some smaller fraternal benefit societies, including the Brotherhood of America in 1935, the Slavic Progressive Beneficial Union in 1937 and the Michigan Union Life Association in 1941.

===20th Century===

By 1920 the ladies&#x27; auxiliary, Ladies of the Maccabees, claimed more than 200,000 members. In 1926, the Maccabees established their headquarters at the Maccabees Building in downtown Detroit, Michigan.

In 1941 the Maccabees gained control of the Michigan Union Life Association, furthering its transformation from a benefit society into a modern, legal-reserve insurance company. In 1960 the Maccabees relocated to a new building in Southfield, Michigan - a suburb of Detroit. In 1962 the group changed its name again, this time to the Maccabees Mutual Life Insurance Company.

In 1986 they built new office building, in Southfield, Michigan. In the 1990s the organization was demutualized and sold to the Royal Insurance Group and operated under the name Royal Maccabees Life Insurance Company. In 1999 Royal Maccabees was sold by its parent company, Royal &amp; SunAlliance Financial Services, to Swiss Re. Swiss Re merged it into its subsidiary, Reassure America Life Insurance Company.

==Organization==

The group was structured on a three tiered model, with local Subordinate Camps, Great Camps at the district level and the whole considered the Supreme Tent. By the 1970s the local groups were called &quot;Subordinate Units&quot;. Head offices were traditionally in Detroit, but in 1965 they were moved to Southfield, Michigan.

The Ladies of the Maccabees were the group&#x27;s female auxiliary.

== Membership ==

Membership was open to all white persons between 18 and 70, though those over 52 were ineligible for the beneficiary features. Applicants had to be of good moral character, bodily healthy and socially acceptable. Furthermore, those engaged in extra-hazardous occupations, such as coal miners, electric line men, aeronauts, people engaged in blasting, the manufacture of highly flammable or explosive material and submarine officers were excluded from membership. Also, no one who was involved in the liquor trade or an alcoholic was admitted. Certain classes of railway employees, expressmen, miners (excluding coal miners) and firemen had to pay an additional 25 cents assessment per each $1,000.

On December 1, 1896 the Knights had 182,000 members in 40 states and provinces, though a third of the membership was in Michigan. The death rate among the membership was 5.54 per 1,000, which was considered exceptionally low. They also had a permanent headquarters in Port Huron, which had opened in 1892. By 1915 membership had reached 331,756. However, by 1978 membership was down to about 10,000 There were 3,500 members in the US and Canada in 1994.

===Degrees===

* Degree of Protection - In the Degree of Protection, the candidate was introduced to the demands of Honor, Courage, and Obedience. The candidate learned the history of Maccabee household and how it protected Judea from King Antiochus during the war of independence. To prove themselves fit to &quot;join in the cause of humanity,&quot; the tyros had to undergo an ordeal.
* Degree of Friendship - In the Degree of Friendship, the Commander takes the part of Mattathias, the Lt. Commander that of Judas, the Past Commander that of John (son of Mattathias), and the Chaplain that of Eleazar (son of Mattathias). The candidate received instruction in the nature of friendship.
* Degree of Loyalty - In the Degree of Loyalty, the dramatic work revolved around the following characters: Apelles, Mattathias, Matthathias&#x27;s four sons, Judas, Soldiers, while the candidate, Sentinel, and a Knight took the parts of Jewish peasants. In keeping with the Maccabee legend of the revolt at Modin the patriarch Mattathias remained steadfast to the Jewish religion when ordered to make sacrifice to Greek gods and at great personal risk stops an apostate Jew from offering sacrifice to false gods. The lesson derived from his example was that of genuine patriotism and inculcated the duty to uphold and defend the rights of liberty and conscience when they are threatened by irresponsible power in any form. Additionally, the candidate was reintroduced to the ghost of Eleazar and finally sees the end of the rebellion.

<doc id="397534" wikidata="Q1333813" url="?curid=397534" title="Mikado (game)">
<text>Mikado is a pick-up sticks game originating in Europe, played with a set of same-length sticks which can measure between .

In 1936, it was brought from Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946) (where it was called Marokko) to the United States and named pick-up sticks. This term is not very specific in respect to existing stick game variations. The &quot;Mikado&quot; name may have been avoided because it was a brand name of a game producer. The game is named for the highest scoring (blue) stick &quot;Mikado&quot; (Emperor of Japan).

== Rules ==
Classic Mikado consists of 41 sticks, coded with different values that have a total of 170 points and are around 15 cm long.

The sticks are bundled and taken in one hand that touches the table or ground. The release creates a circular jumble. Now the players take turns, in which one stick after another should be taken up without moving or touching others. The take-away could be by hand, possibly through pressing on a stick&#x27;s tip or if one has already picked up a special stick (Mikado/Mandarin), it could be used as a helper, possibly to throw up another stick.

On a fault the turn ends (the last stick taken is not counted). The next player bundles and drops the sticks again. After several rounds, normally five, the one with the highest score – the total of the values of the sticks picked up – is the winner.

A player is allowed to stand up on but not to leave their own place. A bad throw could be rerun and the rules should be kept strict in respect to moving sticks to enjoy the game.

== Rule variations ==
During a player&#x27;s turn:
*the sticks are rebundled and dropped again (traditional);
*the stack is taken over as is from the previous player (casual);
*the person to the left of the player turn rebundles and drops the sticks for the player, thus eliminating the potential for a doctored drop.

Sticks allowed as pick-up helpers:
*Mikado (traditional);
*only the Mikado if the player has at least one of all other sticks (Kuli, Samurai, Bonzen, Mandarin);
*Mikado / Mandarin (simplified);
*Mikado / Mandarin / Bonzen (casual);
*any stick already picked up (very casual).

A stick taken when picking it up makes another stick in the stack move:
*is not added to the player&#x27;s score and dropped back (stack take-over variant);
*is not added (traditional);
*is added to the player&#x27;s score.

Scoring:
*the exact sequence of Kuli, Samurai, Bonzen and Mandarin may double the points of a turn;
*a player who does not use the correct helper may lose all points of the current turn.

<doc id="397540" wikidata="Q4547794" url="?curid=397540" title="11th (Northern) Division">
<text>The 11th (Northern) Division, was an infantry division of the British Army during the First World War, raised from men who had volunteered for Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies. The division fought in the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front. The division&#x27;s insignia was an ankh or ankhus.

==History==
The division came into existence on 21 August 1914 under Army Order No. 324, which authorised the formation of the first six new divisions of Kitchener&#x27;s Army. The division was composed of early wartime volunteers and assembled at Belton Park near Grantham. 

By mid-1915, the recruits were judged to be ready for active service, and the division sailed for the Mediterranean in June-July 1915. As part of the Suvla Bay landing force, it reinforced the British expeditionary force at Gallipoli, on 7 August. The 6th (Service) Battalion, Alexandra, Princess of Wales Own (Yorkshire Regiment) (32nd Brigade) was the first &quot;Kitchener unit&quot; to be involved in a major offensive operation of the war. Its action at Lala Baba Hill, on 7 August, was costly: all but three of its officers were killed, including the CO, Colonel E. H. Chapman, were killed. Afterwards the hill was known to the Allies as York Hill. The division continued to serve at Gallipoli, suffering high casualties, until the evacuation of Suvla in December 1915. It then spent a period of time in Egypt, guarding the Suez Canal.

The division was transferred to France in mid-1916 and saw action in the Battle of the Somme. It remained on the Western Front until the armistice of 11 November 1918. 

On 28 June 1919, exactly five years since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the 11th (Northern) Division was officially disbanded, having sustained more than 32,100 casualties during the war.

<text>Jonchets or onchets is a pick-up sticks game from France played with carved sticks. References to the game date back as far as the 17th century, and it was quite popular at the start of the 20th century. The sticks were originally made of rush, but later also from wood, bone or ivory.

&quot;Jonchets&quot; can be played by 2 to 4 players, with 30 to 40 sticks at a length of . The sticks are thrown on a table, and the rules of play are likely similar to pick-up sticks. In jonchets, some sticks may have carved heads that denote different point values.

Mikado is a simplified variation that may have been directly inspired by jonchets.

&quot;Jonchets&quot; were the name of a stick abacus calcus form in France with Asian background.

<doc id="397559" wikidata="Q521096" url="?curid=397559" title="Pride Fighting Championships">
<text>PRIDE Fighting Championships (Pride or Pride FC, founded as KRS-Pride) was a Japanese mixed martial arts promotion company. Its inaugural event was held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997. Pride held more than sixty mixed martial arts events, broadcast to about 40 countries worldwide. PRIDE was owned by the holding company Dream Stage Entertainment (DSE).

For the ten years of its existence, PRIDE was one of the most popular MMA organizations in the world. Pride broadcast its event on Japanese pay-per-view and free-to-air television for millions of spectators in Japan, holding large events in sports stadiums, including the largest live MMA event audience record of 91,107 people at the Pride and K-1 co-production, &quot;Shockwave/Dynamite&quot;, held in August 2002, as well as the audience record of over 67,450 people at the &quot;Pride Final Conflict 2003&quot;.

With its origins in Japanese professional wrestling, PRIDE was known for its focus on spectacle and entertainment. Events were proceeded with opening ceremonies and fighters had elaborate entrances. There was no formal weight classes—except for championship belt bouts and the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; tournaments—and fighters would often matched with opponents from wildly different weights. Including the frequent promotion of &quot;technique vs size&quot; freakshow fights. Pride also had the &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, one-night single-elimination tournaments with multiple fighters. The PRIDE ruleset was also more permissive then the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, permitting soccer kicks, stomps and knees to downed opponents, body slams directly in the head (&quot;spiking&quot;), and allowed more fighting outfits, including wrestling shoes and &quot;keikogis&quot;. Matches were done in a boxing-style roped ring and went for an opening ten minute round followed by two rounds of five minutes.

In 2006, DSE started to have financial issues, as a scandal revealing ties between the company and &quot;yakuza&quot; resulted in the end of multiple lucrative contracts with Japanese broadcasters. In March 2007, DSE sold Pride to Lorenzo Fertitta and Frank Fertitta III, co-owners of Zuffa, which, at the time, owned the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). While remaining as legally separate entities with separate managements, the two promotions were set to cooperate in a manner akin to the AFL-NFL merger. However, such an arrangement did not materialize, and in October 2007, Pride Worldwide&#x27;s Japanese staff was laid off, marking the end of the organization as an active fight promoter, while the top and most popular fighters were brought to the UFC. As a result, many of the Pride staff left to form a new organization alongside K-1 parent company Fighting and Entertainment Group. That new organization, founded in February 2008, was named DREAM.

In 2015, Pride&#x27;s co-founder and former president Nobuyuki Sakakibara established Rizin Fighting Federation in Japan with the same philosophy and ambition as for the defunct Pride organization.

==History==
===Early years (1997–1999)===
Pride has its roots on Japanese Professional wrestling (&quot;Puroresu&quot;). In the 1970s, Antonio Inoki rose to pronominance in Japan by founding New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and introducing his own style of wrestling he dubbed &quot;Strong-style&quot;, derived from training in Karate and Catch-As-Catch-Can, an earlier style of legit Professional wrestling and submission grappling, taught by Karl Gotch. This style was more realistic, using full contact strikes and a lot of kicks, as well as realistic grappling moves from his Catch Wrestling training. Inoki promoted professional wrestling as a legit and real combat sport and the &quot;strongest&quot; fighting style, and to prove it he fought worked (i.e. predetermined) matches against fighters from other martial arts and combat sports, such as judo, kickboxing, sumo and karate, known as &quot;heterogeneous combat sports bouts&quot; (&quot;Ishu Kakutōgi Sen&quot;; 異種格闘技戦). In 1976 Inoki fought a match against boxing world-champion Muhammad Ali, since neither fighter could agree on who would be the loser, the match evolved into a shoot (i.e. real) fight between the two contestants, eventually resulting in a draw.

The match against Muhammad Ali, as well the other heterogeneous style bouts inspired a lot of Inoki&#x27;s students. They left NJPW and founded a new company named Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF), which promoted a realistic style of pro-wrestling that eschewed the most theatrical elements of wrestling and resembled closer to an actual fight, but it was still predetermined. This style would become known as &quot;Shoot Wrestling&quot;. The UWF closed in 1990 and was succeeded in 1991 by the UWFi, which became one of the top professional wrestling promotions in Japan, as their brand of shoot wrestling proved to be exceedingly popular with the Japanese public. The main attraction and most popular star of the UWFi was Nobuhiko Takada. The other precursors of Pride were the Japanese mixed martial arts competitions and shoot style pro wrestling promotions Shooto, a self-styled hybrid martial art organization founded in 1985 by former shoot wrestler &quot;Tiger Mask&quot; Satoru Sayama, Pancrase founded in 1993 by wrestlers Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki attempting to create a non-scripted shoot wrestling promotion, Vale Tudo Japan, a Vale Tudo tournament organized in 1994 by Satoru Sayama based on the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Brazilian Vale Tudo and Kingdom, founded in 1997 as a successor to the UWFi. Pride was also influenced by the wild rise of K-1, a kickboxing promotion founded in 1993 which became very popular in Japan for its huge and action-packed tournaments.

Pride Fighting Championships was initially conceived of in 1997, to match popular Japanese pro-wrestler Nobuhiko Takada with Rickson Gracie, the purported champion of the Gracie family of Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners, who gained popularity in Japan after winning the 1994 and 1995 Vale Tudo Japan tournaments and brutally defeating UWFi pro wrestler Yoji Anjo in a dojo storm at Rickson&#x27;s gym in Los Angeles. The event, held at the Tokyo Dome on October 11, 1997, and organised by Hiromichi Momose, Naoto Morishita and Nobuyuki Sakakibara from KRS (Kakutougi Revolutionary Spirits) promotion, attracted 47,000 fans, as well as Japanese mass media attention. The success of the first event enabled its promoters to hold a regular series of mixed martial arts events, and a year later in 1998, to promote a rematch between Takada and Gracie. With K-1 enjoying popularity in Japan, Pride began to compete with monthly showings on Fuji Television, as well as pay per view on the newly formed satellite television channel SKY PerfecTV. Following the fourth event, the series was taken over by the Dream Stage Entertainment, formed by the members of the dissolved KRS, and it was accordingly renamed as the Pride Fighting Championships, with Morishita as its first chairman.
===Pride Grand Prix, Bushido and further rise (2000–2006)===
In 2000, Pride hosted the first &quot;Pride Grand Prix&quot;, a two-part openweight tournament held to find the &quot;world&#x27;s best fighter&quot;. The tournament was held over the course of two events, with sixteen fighters competing in an opening round and the eight winners returning three months later for the final round. The second round of the tournament marked the first time Pride was broadcast in the United States and featured American fighter Mark Coleman winning the tournament by defeating Igor Vovchanchyn in the final round. Pride would gain a fervent fanbase in the US, boosted by a highlights deal with Fox Sports Networks and regular DVD releases of Pride shows including older cards that were not initially screened outside of Japan. English-language commentary for Pride was provided by Stephen Quadros or Mauro Ranallo, with Bas Rutten or Frank Trigg providing analysis.

In August 2002, Pride teamed up with Japan&#x27;s leading kickboxing and fight promotion, K-1, and held the world&#x27;s biggest fight event, &quot;Shockwave&quot; (known as &quot;Pride/K-1 Dynamite!!&quot; in Japan), which attracted over 71,000 fans.

On January 13, 2003, the Pride MMA production was thrown into turmoil when DSE president Naoto Morishita was found dead hanging by his neck in his hotel room, apparently after his mistress told him she wanted to end their affair. One of the stories go that Fedor Emelianenko was held at gunpoint to resign with Pride Nobuyuki Sakakibara later assumed the presidency, later joined by Takada as a general manager.

In 2003 Pride introduced the &quot;Bushido&quot; series of events, which focused mainly, but not exclusively, on the lighter weight classes of lightweights and welterweights. The Bushido series also stressed a faster pace, with bouts consisting of only one ten-minute round and one five-minute round, as well as quicker referee intervention of stalling tactics, using the new &quot;yellow card&quot; system of purse deduction.

Also in 2003, Pride returned to the tournament format, with a middleweight grand prix spanning two events, &quot;Pride Total Elimination 2003&quot; and &quot;Final Conflict 2003&quot;. The format was expanded to three events in 2004, adding &quot;Critical Countdown 2004&quot; as the second round. Pride would go on to hold annual tournaments, a heavyweight tournament in 2004, a middleweight in 2005, and an openweight in 2006.

===Decline (2006–2007)===
In 2006 DSE announced it would showcase Pride alongside the Ultimate Fighting Championship, North America&#x27;s largest MMA event, and would be integrating their fighters, including Wanderlei Silva and Kazuyuki Fujita, at a UFC MMA show in November. However, Dana White, speaking on behalf of Zuffa then commented that the announced bout between Chuck Liddell and Wanderlei Silva was unlikely to happen because &quot;the Japanese are very hard to do business with&quot;. This statement was likely due to the failure of previous attempts between Zuffa and DSE to organize a fighter exchange agreement. Specifically after entering Liddell in Pride&#x27;s 2003 middleweight tournament, which was also with the intention of Liddell eventually fighting Silva, which fell through when Liddell lost in the semi-finals to Quinton Jackson (Jackson subsequently lost to Silva by technical knockout in the finals.)

Pride continued to enjoy success, holding roughly ten events per year, and even out-drawing rival K-1 at the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve show &quot;Pride Shockwave 2005&quot;. On October 21, 2006, Pride held its first MMA event in US, &quot;Pride 32: The Real Deal&quot; took place in front of an audience of 11,727 at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Paradise, Nevada, and was the first Pride event to be held outside Japan.

On June 5, 2006, the Fuji Network announced that they were terminating their television contract with Pride Fighting Championships effective immediately due to a breach of contract by DSE. This left Pride with only SKY PerfecTV, a pay-per-view carrier, as a television outlet in Japan, and the loss of the substantial revenues from the Fuji deal threatened its sustainability. Dream was surrounded by speculation in the Japanese media, especially in the Japanese tabloid &quot;Shukan Gendai&quot;, that it may be a front for the notorious yakuza crime organization. Dream responded to the loss by stating they will continue with their schedule as currently planned, including an event in Las Vegas, &quot;Pride 33: Second Coming&quot; which took place on February 24, 2007, Pride&#x27;s second event outside Japan.

In late 2006, DSE hinted at plans for Mike Tyson to fight in the organization&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve show. Tyson was to face a Pride fighter under boxing rules. Since Tyson is not allowed to fight in Japan because of his criminal record, Pride wanted to stage the fight in an alternate country, possibly Macau, China. The fight would be broadcast live on large television screens in the Saitama Super Arena, where the regular mixed martial arts bouts were held. The fight did not occur, however.

On November 29, 2006, Pride announced the discontinuation of its Bushido events, with the intention of integrating the matches from lighter weight classes, mainly featured in Bushido, into regular Pride events. Pride also announced that future Grand Prix tournaments would take place on a four-year weight class cycle, with one Grand Prix per year. The first expected one, a lightweight Grand Prix, ended up being cancelled.
===Acquisition by Zuffa (2007)===
On Tuesday, March 27, 2007, Pride executives Nobuyuki Sakakibara and Nobuhiko Takada announced that Station Casinos Inc. magnate Lorenzo Fertitta, co-owner of Zuffa and its subsidiary MMA production Ultimate Fighting Championship, had made a deal to acquire all assets of Pride Fighting Championships from Dream Stage Entertainment after Pride 34: Kamikaze in a deal reportedly worth USD$65 million, though the figure was not publicly disclosed. Managing the assets under the newly created Pride FC Worldwide Holdings, LLC, including their video library and the contracts of the fighters currently on the Pride roster, the new management company had originally planned to continue to promote Pride events in Japan and keep to its previously announced schedule. Lorenzo Fertitta announced they planned to operate Pride separately from Zuffa&#x27;s two MMA brands, the UFC and WEC, planned on having occasional crossover shows and matches, pitting fighters from Pride against fighters &quot;from the UFC,&quot; using the metaphor of the AFL-NFL merger to compare the situation.

Subsequent remarks by Zuffa spokesperson Dana White however cast doubt as to what the new owners would actually do with Pride. After the sale officially closed on May 25, 2007, White remarked that he planned on bringing Pride&#x27;s biggest names into UFC competition instead of keeping them in Pride and that they were still deciding on what to do with Pride itself. In later comments made in August 2007, White expressed doubt that Zuffa can resurrect Pride in Japan, claiming, &quot;I&#x27;ve [&quot;or&quot;, &quot;we&quot;] pulled everything out of the trick box that I can and I can&#x27;t get a TV deal over there with Pride. I don&#x27;t think they want us there. I don&#x27;t think they want me there.&quot;

On October 4, 2007, Pride Worldwide closed its Japanese office, laying off 20 people who were working there since the closing of DSE.

==Multimedia==
=== Video ===
The final Pride events have been released on DVD under the Pride Worldwide label.

Past fights from Pride are shown on &quot;Best of Pride Fighting Championships&quot;. The program premiered January 15, 2010, on Spike TV. The program&#x27;s host is Kenda Perez.

===Video games===
Pride Fighting Championships released two licensed video games during its time in business, as well as being featured in an Ultimate Fighting Championship game in 2012.

* The first game, &quot;Pride FC: Fighting Championships&quot; was developed by Anchor Inc. and released by THQ for the PlayStation 2 in February 2003 in Japan and North America and April 2003 in Europe. The game received an aggregate score of 73/100 on Metacritic, based on 19 critic reviews.
* The second game, &quot;PrideGP Grand Prix 2003&quot; was developed and released by Capcom also for the PlayStation 2 in November 2003, but was only released in Japan.
* Pride Fighting Championships was also featured in the video game &quot;UFC Undisputed 3&quot;. Featuring main Pride event rules and 33 Pride fighters (not counting the Pride alumni on the UFC roster to date), the mode also has commentary provided by Bas Rutten and Stephen Quadros, with Lenne Hardt as the English Ring Announcer and Kei Grant as the Japanese Ring Announcer.

==Rules==
Pride&#x27;s rules differed between main Pride events and Bushido events. It was announced on November 29, 2006, that Bushido events would be discontinued.

===Match length===
Pride matches originally consisted of three rounds; the first lasted ten minutes and the second and third each lasted five minutes. Intermissions between each round were two minutes long. In Pride events held in the United States, the NSAC unified MMA rules were used: non-title matches consisted of three five-minute rounds and title matches consisted of five five-minute rounds, both with 60-second intermissions.

When two rounds of a Grand Prix took place on the same night, bouts consisted of two rounds, the first lasting ten minutes and the second lasting five. Intermissions between each round remained two minutes long.

===Weight classes===
:&quot;Pride Fighting Championships did not divide their fighters based on weight divisions per se. A fighter could be booked to fight an opponent of any weight. Weight divisions were used for championship bouts and for Grands Prix to decide a best fighter at a given weight class.&quot;

===Ring===
Pride used a five-roped square ring with sides 7 m in length (approximately 23 ft). The same was used at Pride: Bushido events.

===Attire===
Pride allowed fighters latitude in their choice of attire, but open finger gloves, a mouthguard and a protective cup were mandatory. Fighters were allowed to use tape on parts of their body or to wear a gi top, gi pants, wrestling shoes, kneepads, elbow pads, or ankle supports, and masks at their own discretion, though each was checked by the referee before the fight.

===Victory===
Matches could be won via:
* Submission
**A fighter taps either his opponent or the mat three times
**A fighter verbally submits
* Technical submission
** A fighter goes unconscious from a choke
** An arm, or any other body part, is broken by the submission 
* Knockout
**A fighter falls from a legal blow and is either unconscious or unable to immediately continue
* Technical knockout
** Referee stoppage (the referee stops the match after seeing that one fighter is completely dominant to the point of endangering his opponent)
** Doctor stoppage (the referee stops the match in the event that a fighter is injured via a legal blow and the ring doctor determines that he cannot continue)
** Forfeited match (a fighter&#x27;s corner throws in the towel)
* Decision
**If the match reaches its time limit then the outcome of the bout is determined by the three judges. The fight is scored in its entirety and not round-by-round. (In Pride events staged in the United States, however, the fights were scored round by round.) After the third round, each judge must decide a winner. Matches cannot end in a draw. A decision is made according to the following criteria in this order of priority:
:#The effort made to finish the fight via KO or submission
:#Damage given to the opponent
:#Standing combinations and ground control
:#Takedowns and takedown defense
:#Aggressiveness
:#Weight (in the case that the weight difference is 10 kg/22 lb or more)

:If a fight was stopped on advice of the ring doctor after an accidental but illegal action, e.g. a clash of heads, and the contest is in its second or third round, the match was decided by the judges using the same criteria.
* Disqualification
**A &quot;warning&quot; was given in the form of a yellow card or a green card (The green card gave a 10% deduction of a fighter&#x27;s purse) when a fighter committed an illegal action or did not follow the referee&#x27;s instruction. Three warnings resulted in a disqualification
**A fighter was disqualified if a match was stopped, on the advice of the ring doctor, as a result of his deliberate illegal actions.
**The application of oil, ointment, spray, Vaseline, massaging cream, hair cream, or any other substances to any part of the fighter&#x27;s body before and during the fights was prohibited. The discovery of any of these substances resulted in a disqualification.
* No contest
**In the event that both sides committed a violation of the rules, the bout would be declared a &quot;no contest&quot;.
**If a fight was stopped on the advice of the ring doctor after an accidental but illegal action, i.e. a clash of heads, the match would be declared a no contest in the first round only

===Fouls===
Pride Fighting Championships considered the following to be fouls:
: Head butting
: Eye gouging
: Hair pulling
: Biting
: Fish hooking
: Any attacks to the groin
: Purposely striking the back of the head (if a punch was thrown and the fighter turned away letting it land on the back of his head it was okay), which included the occipital region and the spine. The sides of the head and the area around the ears were not considered to be the back of the head ( rabbit punch).
: Small joint manipulation (control of four or more fingers or toes was necessary).
: Elbow strikes to the head and face.
: Intentionally throwing the opponent out of the ring.
: Running out of the ring.
: Purposely holding the ropes. Fighters were not permitted to purposely hang an arm or leg on the ropes and it would result in an immediate warning.
: Stomps to a grounded fighter along with kicks and knees to the head of a grounded fighter, only in events in the US.

In the event that a fighter was injured by illegal actions, then at the discretion of the referee and ring doctor, the round would attempt to be resumed after enough time had been given to the fighter to recover. Once the fight started again the fighters would be placed in the exact position when the referee called the time out. If the match could not be continued due to the severity of the injury then the fighter who perpetrated the action was disqualified.

===Match conduct===
* If both fighters were on the verge of falling out of the ring or became entangled in the ropes, the referee would stop the action. The fighters were required to immediately stop their movements and then would be repositioned in the center of the ring in the same relative position. Once they were comfortably repositioned, they would resume at the referee&#x27;s instruction.
* Referees could give a fighter a penalty card for lack of activity. Every card, including warning cards, were a 10% deduction of a fighter&#x27;s purse, this method was aimed to prevent inaction.

===Matches between fighters of different weight classes===
Pride made special provisions for fights between fighters of different weight classes or fighters with a large weight difference in the same weight class. The lighter fighter was given a choice of whether or not to permit knees or kicks to the face when in the &quot;four points&quot; position in the following cases:
*If both fighters were in the middleweight class and there was a weight difference of 10 kg/22 lb or more between the fighters.
*If the match was between a middleweight and heavyweight and there was a weight difference of 10 kg/22 lb or more between the fighters.
*If both fighters were in the heavyweight class and there was a weight difference of 15 kg/33 lb or more between the fighters.

===Pride Bushido===
PRIDE BUSHIDO were a series of PRIDE events with a special ruleset. The word BUSHIDO translates from the Japanese language as &quot;the way of the warrior&quot;. More specifically, the term refers to the principals and moral code that developed among the samurai (military) class of Japan. BUSHIDO provided flexibility for more experimental fight card formats, such as &quot;team&quot; competitions pitting country versus country, or fight team versus fight team. BUSHIDO also gave an opportunity to up and coming fighters to prove themselves through matches with a special ruleset, known as &quot;Challenge Matches.&quot; There were a few minor differences from main Pride events:
*Bouts on Pride Bushido events consisted of two rounds; the first lasting ten minutes and the second lasting five. Intermissions between each round were two minutes in length.
*Bushido &quot;Challenge Matches&quot; consisted of two rounds lasting five minutes each. Intermissions between each round were two minutes in length.
*In Bushido, red cards were issued in a similar way that yellow cards were used in Pride FC. A red card resulted in a 10% deduction of the fighter&#x27;s fight purse. Red cards could be given out in an unlimited number without disqualification. If fighters committed the following actions, they were to be given a red card by officials:
**stalling or failure to initiate any offensive attack
**making no attempt to finalize the match or damage the opponent
**holding the opponent&#x27;s body with the arms and legs to produce a stalemate

===Differences from the &quot;Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts&quot;===
Some states&#x27; athletic commissions require mixed martial arts events to modify rules to match the &quot;Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Combat&quot;, as introduced by the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board, and adopted by the Nevada State Athletic Commission in order to receive state sanctioning.

Pride&#x27;s rules differed from the &quot;Unified Rules of Combat&quot; in the following ways:
*Pride allowed kicking and kneeing the head of a downed opponent. This is considered a foul in the unified rules, which only allows kicks and knees to the head of a standing opponent.
*Pride allowed a fighter to stomp the head of a downed opponent. This is considered a foul in the unified rules.
*Pride allowed a fighter to spike (piledrive) an opponent onto the canvas on his head or neck. This is considered a foul in the unified rules.
*Pride did not allow elbow strikes to the head of an opponent. The unified rules allow elbows provided they are not striking directly down with the point of the elbow (12 o&#x27;clock to 6 o&#x27;clock).
*Pride&#x27;s matches included a ten-minute first round, with two-minute rest periods. The unified rules allow rounds no longer than five minutes, with rest periods not exceeding one minute.
*Pride&#x27;s matches were not judged on the ten-point must system, rather judges scored the whole fight. The unified rules call for all matches to be judged using the ten-point must system.

At the announcement on March 27, 2007, that the Fertittas were purchasing Pride, it was stated that all future Pride events (after Pride 34) would be held under unified rules, eliminating 10-minute opening rounds, ground knees, stomps and more, though there were no more Pride events held to use these rules.

==Pride events==

Events typically begin with the theme music entitled &quot;PRIDE&quot;, composed by Yasuharu Takanashi, with each fight ending with the music entitled &quot;Victory&quot;, also composed by Takanashi. In addition to their main, &quot;numbered&quot; events, Pride have staged other series of events for different purposes.

===Pride Grand Prix===
The Pride GP (Grand Prix) is the name of a series of tournaments held by Pride. In addition to a money prize, a championship belt was given to the winner of each tournament, though this belt only denoted the tournament winner and would never be defended. However, Pride&#x27;s Shockwave 2005 event crowned not only the welterweight and lightweight tournament champions, but also Pride&#x27;s inaugural welterweight and lightweight champions. Of note is the amount of past and future champions that would participate in these tournaments.

In 2000, Pride held their first Grand Prix. With no weight limits, it is now considered to be their first openweight grand prix. Held across two events, Pride Grand Prix 2000 Opening Round featured first round bouts and Pride Grand Prix 2000 Finals featured the quarter-finals, semi finals and final.

The concept was brought back in 2003, with a middleweight grand prix. Held across two cards, Pride Total Elimination 2003 featured the first round of the Grand Prix and Final Conflict 2003 featured the semi-finals and final. Subsequent middleweight, heavyweight and openweight grands prix had taken place across three events when, in 2004, Critical Countdown was introduced for second round bouts. Both Critical Countdown and Final Conflict had a mix of Grand Prix and non-Grand Prix matches.

In 2007, it was announced that Pride would hold only one Grand Prix a year and it would rotate between each of their four established weight classes.

====Format====
Except for the inaugural 2000 Grand Prix, tournament dates with only one round would adhere to normal Pride or Pride Bushido rules. For tournament dates that held two rounds, a fight had a 10-minute first round, followed by a two-minute rest period for the fighters, and then a five-minute last round.

=====Exceptions=====
The 2000 Finals held a 90-minute contest between Kazushi Sakuraba and Royce Gracie. Gracie had requested that there be no judging and no limit to the number of rounds. Sakuraba agreed to fight under these rules, and the contest went to a total of 90 minutes of fighting, after which Gracie&#x27;s corner threw in the towel due to damage to Gracie&#x27;s legs. Sakuraba advanced to the next round, fighting a fifteen-minute first round against eventual runner up Igor Vovchanchyn, after which Sakuraba&#x27;s corner threw in the towel citing his exhaustion.

====List of events====
===Pride Bushido===
With Pride&#x27;s numbered shows and Grands Prix focused on heavier fighters, in October 2003, Pride started a series of events entitled &quot;Bushido&quot;. With the focus on lighter combatants, two weight classes, lightweight and welterweight, were formed at 73 and 83 kg respectively. After Pride Bushido 13, it was announced that the series would end and these weight classes would transfer to main Pride shows.

In 2005, Pride Bushido staged welterweight and lightweight Grands Prix. Two eight-man brackets were set up and the quarter-finals and semi finals were held at Pride Bushido 9, along with an alternate bout in each bracket. The finals were held at Pride Shockwave 2005, with the winners subsequently being crowned as champions for their division. A sixteen-man welterweight grand prix was held in 2006.

===Pride The Best===
In 2002, Pride launched &quot;The Best&quot;, a series of shows featuring up-and-coming fighters, using an eight-sided roped ring. However, after the third show in October 2002, the series was discontinued. The concept was later refined into the Pride Bushido events.

==Final champions==
When Zuffa LLC bought Pride, it moved to unify the Pride middleweight and welterweight titles with its own light-heavyweight (205 lbs) and middleweight (185 lbs) titles. Dan Henderson, who held both the Pride middleweight and welterweight belts at the time of the Zuffa buy-out, was beaten in two unification bouts, first to Quinton &#x27;Rampage&#x27; Jackson in September 2007 and then to middleweight Anderson Silva in March 2008.

The titleholders below were those who held the titles on April 8, 2007, the date of the last Pride FC promoted show.

<text>The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline is a long crude oil pipeline from the Azeri–Chirag–Gunashli oil field in the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. It connects Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan and Ceyhan, a port on the south-eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey, via Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. It is the second-longest oil pipeline in the former Soviet Union, after the Druzhba pipeline. The first oil that was pumped from the Baku end of the pipeline reached Ceyhan on 28 May 2006.

==History==

===Planning===
The Caspian Sea lies above one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of oil and gas fields. As the sea is landlocked, transporting oil to Western markets is complicated. During Soviet times, all transportation routes from the Caspian region were through Russia. The collapse of the Soviet Union inspired a search for new routes. Russia first insisted that the new pipeline should pass through its territory, then declined to participate.

In the spring of 1992, the Turkish Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel proposed to Central Asian countries including Azerbaijan that the pipeline run through Turkey. The first document on the construction of the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline was signed between Azerbaijan and Turkey on 9 March 1993 in Ankara. The Turkish route meant a pipeline from Azerbaijan would run through Georgia or Armenia, but the route through Armenia was politically impossible due to the unresolved war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. This left the circuitous Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey route, longer and more expensive to build than the other option.

The project gained momentum following the Ankara Declaration, adopted on 29 October 1998 by President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev, President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze, President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of Turkey Süleyman Demirel, and President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov. The declaration was witnessed by the United States Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, who expressed strong support for the pipeline. The intergovernmental agreement in support of the pipeline was signed by Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey on 18 November 1999, during a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Istanbul, Turkey.

===Construction===
The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Company (BTC Co.) was established in London on 1 August 2002. The ceremony launching construction of the pipeline was held on 18 September 2002. Construction began in April 2003 and was completed in 2005. The Azerbaijan section was constructed by Consolidated Contractors International of Greece, and Georgia&#x27;s section was constructed by a joint venture of France&#x27;s Spie Capag and UK Petrofac International. The Turkish section was constructed by BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corporation. Bechtel was the main contractor for engineering, procurement and construction. Detailed design and engineering contractor was ILF Consulting Engineers for the Turkish section of pipeline, which is approximately over 1000km.

===Inauguration===
On 25 May 2005, the pipeline was inaugurated at the Sangachal Terminal by President Ilham Aliyev of the Azerbaijan Republic, President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia and President Ahmet Sezer of Turkey, joined by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and United States Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman. The inauguration of the Georgian section was hosted by President Mikheil Saakashvili at the pumping station near Gardabani on 12 October 2005. The inauguration ceremony at Ceyhan terminal was held on 13 July 2006.

The pipeline was gradually filled with 10 million barrels of oil flowing from Baku and reaching Ceyhan on 28 May 2006. The first oil was loaded at the Ceyhan Marine Terminal (Haydar Aliyev Terminal) onto a tanker named &quot;British Hawthorn&quot;. The tanker sailed on 4 June 2006 with about of crude oil.

==Description==
===Route===
The long pipeline starts at the Sangachal Terminal near Baku in Azerbaijan, crosses Georgia and terminates at the Ceyhan Marine Terminal (Haydar Aliyev Terminal) on the south-eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. of the pipeline lie in Azerbaijan, in Georgia and in Turkey. It crosses several mountain ranges at altitudes to . It also traverses 3,000 roads, railways, and utility lines—both overground and underground—and 1,500 watercourses up to wide (in the case of the Ceyhan River in Turkey). The pipeline occupies a corridor eight meters wide, and is buried to a depth of at least one meter. The pipeline runs parallel to the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline, which transports natural gas from the Sangachal Terminal to Erzurum in Turkey. 

===Technical features===
The pipeline has a projected lifespan of 40 years, and at normal capacity it transports . It needs of oil to fill the pipeline. Oil flows at per second. There are eight pump stations, two in Azerbaijan, two in Georgia, four in Turkey. The project includes also the Ceyhan Marine Terminal (officially the Haydar Aliyev Terminal, named after the Azerbaijani late president Heydar Aliyev), three intermediate pigging stations, one pressure reduction station, and 101 small block valves. It was constructed from 150,000 individual joints of line pipe, each measuring in length. This corresponds to a total weight of . The pipeline is diameter for most of its length, narrowing to diameter as it nears Ceyhan.

===Cost and financing===
The pipeline cost US$3.9 billion. The construction created 10,000 short-term jobs and the operation of the pipeline requires 1,000 long-term employees across a 40-year period. 70% of the costs are funded by third parties, including the World Bank&#x27;s International Finance Corporation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, export credit agencies of seven countries and a syndicate of 15 commercial banks.

===Source of supply===
The pipeline is supplied by oil from Azerbaijan&#x27;s Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field in the Caspian Sea via the Sangachal Terminal. This pipeline may also transport oil from Kazakhstan&#x27;s Kashagan oil field and other oil fields in Central Asia. The government of Kazakhstan announced that it would build a trans-Caspian oil pipeline from the Kazakhstani port of Aktau to Baku, but because of the opposition from both Russia and Iran it started to transport oil to the BTC pipeline by tankers across the Caspian Sea.
Not only Kazakh, but also Turkmen oil have transported via Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline. Thus, in 2015, 5,2 million Kazakh and Turkmen oil were transported via this pipeline to the world markets.

===Possible transhipment via Israel===
It has been proposed that oil from the pipeline be transported to eastern Asia via the Israeli oil terminals at Ashkelon and Eilat, the overland trans-Israel sector being bridged by the Trans-Israel pipeline owned by the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company (EAPC).

==Ownership==
The pipeline is owned and operated by BTC Co, a consortium of 11 energy companies. The consortium is managed by BP. Shareholders are:

*BP (United Kingdom): 30.1%
*State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) (Azerbaijan): 25.00%
*MOL Group (Hungary): 8.90%
*Equinor (Norway): 8.71%
*Türkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortaklığı (TPAO) (Turkey): 6.53%
*Eni (Italy): 5.00%
*TotalEnergies (France): 5.00%
*Itochu (Japan): 3.40%
*Inpex (Japan): 2.50%
*ExxonMobil (USA): 2.50%
*ONGC Videsh (India) 2.36%

==Archaeology==
Azerbaijani, Georgian, Turkish, British, and American archaeologists began archaeological surveys 2000, sponsored by BP. Several cultural artifacts were uncovered during the construction, resulting in a coordinated research of the archaeological sites such as Dashbulaq, Hasansu, Zayamchai, and Tovuzchai in Azerbaijan; Klde, Orchosani, and Saphar-Kharaba in Georgia; and Güllüdere, Yüceören, and Ziyaretsuyu in Turkey.

==Controversies==
===Politics===
Even before its completion, the pipeline was having an effect on the world&#x27;s petroleum politics. The South Caucasus, previously seen as Russia&#x27;s backyard, is now a region of great strategic significance. The U.S. and other Western nations have become much more involved in the affairs of the three nations through which oil will flow. The countries have been trying to use the involvement as a counterbalance to Russian and Iranian economic and military dominance in the region. Russian specialists claim that the pipeline will weaken the Russian influence in the Caucasus. The Russian Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee chairman stated that the United States and other Western countries are planning to station soldiers in the Caucasus on the pretext of instability in regions through which the pipeline passes.

The project has been criticised due to bypassing and regional isolation of Armenia, as well as for human rights and safety concerns. Ilham Aliev, the president of Azerbaijan, which is in conflict with Armenia, was cited as saying, &quot;If we succeed with this project, the Armenians will end in complete isolation, which would create an additional problem for their future, their already bleak future&quot;.

The project also constitutes an important leg of the East–West energy corridor, gaining Turkey greater geopolitical importance. The pipeline supports Georgia&#x27;s independence from Russian influence. Former President Eduard Shevardnadze, one of the architects and initiators of the project, saw construction through Georgia as a guarantee for the country&#x27;s future economic and political security and stability. President Mikhail Saakashvili shares this view. &quot;All strategic contracts in Georgia, especially the contract for the Caspian pipeline are a matter of survival for the Georgian state,&quot; he told reporters on 26 November 2003.

===Economics===
Although some have touted the pipeline as easing the dependence of the United States and other Western nations on oil from the Middle East, it supplies only 1% of global demand during its first stage.

The pipeline diversifies the global oil supply and so insures, to an extent, against a failure in supply elsewhere. Critics of the pipeline—particularly Russia—are skeptical about its economic prospects.

Construction of the pipeline has contributed to the economies of the host countries. In the first half of 2007, a year after the launch of the pipeline as the main export route for Azerbaijani oil, the real GDP growth of Azerbaijan hit a record of 35%. Substantial transit fees accrue to Georgia and Turkey. For Georgia, the transit fees are expected to produce an average of US$62.5 million per year. Turkey is expected to receive approximately US$200 million in transit fees per year in the initial years of operation, with the possibility that the fees increase to US$290 million per year from year 17 to year 40. Turkey also benefits from an increase of commerce in the port of Ceyhan and other parts of eastern Anatolia, the region which had experienced significant decrease in economic activities since the Gulf War in 1991. The reduction of oil tanker traffic on the Bosphorus will contribute to greater security for Istanbul.

To counter concerns that oil money would be siphoned off by corrupt officials, Azerbaijan set up a state oil fund (SOFAZ), mandated with using revenue from natural resources to benefit future generations, bolster support from key international lenders, and improve transparency and accountability. Azerbaijan became the first oil-producing country to join EITI, the British-led Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

===Security===
Concerns have been addressed about the security of the pipeline. It bypasses Armenia, which has an unresolved conflict with Azerbaijan over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, crosses through Georgia, which has two unresolved separatist conflicts, and goes through the edges of the Kurdish region of Turkey, which has seen a prolonged and bitter conflict with Kurdish separatists. It will require constant guarding to prevent sabotage, though the fact that almost all of the pipeline is buried will make it harder to attack. Georgia formed a special purpose battalion that would guard the pipeline while the US watched over the area with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

On 5 August 2008, a major explosion and fire in Refahiye (eastern Turkey Erzincan Province) closed the pipeline. The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) claimed responsibility. The pipeline was restarted on 25 August 2008.

There is circumstantial evidence that it was instead a sophisticated cyber attack on the line&#x27;s control and safety systems that led to increased pressure and an explosion. The attack might have been related to the Russo-Georgian War, which started two days later. However, the cyber attack theory has been largely criticized due to a lack of evidence, and was publicly debunked by ICS cyber security expert Robert M. Lee.

In September 2015, unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh&#x27;s defense minister, Levon Mnatsakanyan, was cited as saying: &quot;This is a very serious financial resource for Azerbaijan and we need to deprive them of these means&quot;. In October 2020, Azerbaijan claimed that pipeline was targeted during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. Armenia rejected the accusations.

===Environment===
Critics of the pipeline have pointed out it should be properly earthquake engineered because it travels through three active faults in Azerbaijan, four in Georgia and seven in Turkey. Environmental activists fiercely opposed the crossing of the watershed of the Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park in Georgia, an area known for mineral water springs and natural beauty, although the pipeline itself does not enter the park. The construction of the pipeline left a highly visible scar across the landscape. The Oxford-based &quot;Baku Ceyhan Campaign&quot; stated that &quot;public money should not be used to subsidize social and environmental problems, purely in the interests of the private sector, but must be conditional on a positive contribution to the economic and social development of people in the region.&quot; As Borjomi mineral water is a major export commodity of Georgia, any oil spills there would have a catastrophic effect on the economy.

The field joint coating of the pipeline has been controversial over the claim that SPC 2888, the sealant used, was not properly tested. BP and its contractors interrupted work until the problem was eliminated.

The pipeline eliminates 350 tanker cargoes per year through the sensitive congested Bosphorus and Dardanelles.

===Human rights===
Human rights activists criticized Western governments for the pipeline, due to reported human and civil rights abuses by the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan. A Czech documentary film &quot;Zdroj&quot; (&quot;Source&quot;) underscores these human rights abuses, such as eminent domain violations in appropriating land for the pipeline&#x27;s route, and criticism of the government leading to arrest.

==In fiction==
The pipeline was a central plot point in the James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (1999). One of the central characters, Elektra King, is responsible for the construction of an oil pipeline through the Caucasus, from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Named the &quot;King pipeline&quot; in the film, it is a thinly disguised version of the BTC.

<doc id="397571" wikidata="Q866364" url="?curid=397571" title="Bisimulation">
<text>In theoretical computer science a bisimulation is a binary relation between state transition systems, associating systems that behave in the same way in that one system simulates the other and vice versa.

Intuitively two systems are bisimilar if they, assuming we view them as playing a &quot;game&quot; according to some rules, match each other&#x27;s moves. In this sense, each of the systems cannot be distinguished from the other by an observer.

== Formal definition ==
Given a labeled state transition system ,
where is a set of states, formula_1 is a set of labels and → is a set of labelled transitions (i.e., a subset of formula_2),
a bisimulation is a binary relation formula_3,
such that both and its converse formula_4 are simulations. From this follows that the symmetric closure of a bisimulation is a bisimulation, and that each symmetric simulation is a bisimulation. Thus some authors define bisimulation as a symmetric simulation.

Equivalently, is a bisimulation if and only if for every pair of states formula_5 in and all labels &quot;λ&quot; in formula_1:

* if formula_7, then there is formula_8 such that formula_9;
* if formula_8, then there is formula_7 such that formula_9.

Given two states and in , is bisimilar to , written formula_13, if and only if there is a bisimulation such that formula_14. This means that the bisimilarity relation is the union of all bisimulations: formula_15 precisely when formula_14 for some bisimulation .

The set of bisimulations is closed under union; therefore, the bisimilarity relation is itself a bisimulation. Since it is the union of all bisimulations, it is the unique largest bisimulation. Bisimulations are also closed under reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closure; therefore, the largest bisimulation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. From this follows that the largest bisimulation—bisimilarity—is an equivalence relation.

== Alternative definitions ==

=== Relational definition ===
Bisimulation can be defined in terms of composition of relations as follows.

Given a labelled state transition system formula_17, a &quot;bisimulation&quot; relation is a binary relation over (i.e., ) such that formula_18

formula_19
and
formula_20

From the monotonicity and continuity of relation composition, it follows immediately that the set of bisimulations is closed under unions (joins in the poset of relations), and a simple algebraic calculation shows that the relation of bisimilarity—the join of all bisimulations—is an equivalence relation. This definition, and the associated treatment of bisimilarity, can be interpreted in any involutive quantale.

=== Fixpoint definition ===

Bisimilarity can also be defined in order-theoretical fashion, in terms of fixpoint theory, more precisely as the greatest fixed point of a certain function defined below.

Given a labelled state transition system (formula_21, Λ, →), define formula_22 to be a function from binary relations over formula_21 to binary relations over formula_21, as follows:

Let formula_25 be any binary relation over formula_21. formula_27 is defined to be the set of all pairs formula_5 in formula_21 × formula_21 such that:

formula_31
and
formula_32

Bisimilarity is then defined to be the greatest fixed point of formula_33.

=== Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game definition ===
Bisimulation can also be thought of in terms of a game between two players: attacker and defender.

&quot;Attacker&quot; goes first and may choose any valid transition, formula_34, from formula_5. That is,
formula_36
or 
formula_37

The &quot;Defender&quot; must then attempt to match that transition, formula_34 from either formula_39 or formula_40 depending on the attacker&#x27;s move.
I.e., they must find an formula_34 such that:
formula_42
or 
formula_43

Attacker and defender continue to take alternating turns until:

* The defender is unable to find any valid transitions to match the attacker&#x27;s move. In this case the attacker wins.
* The game reaches states formula_5 that are both &#x27;dead&#x27; (i.e., there are no transitions from either state) In this case the defender wins
* The game goes on forever, in which case the defender wins.
* The game reaches states formula_5, which have already been visited. This is equivalent to an infinite play and counts as a win for the defender.

By the above definition the system is a bisimulation if and only if there exists a winning strategy for the defender.

=== Coalgebraic definition ===

A bisimulation for state transition systems is a special case of coalgebraic bisimulation for the type of covariant powerset functor.
Note that every state transition system formula_17 can be mapped bijectively to a function formula_47 from formula_21 to the powerset of formula_21 indexed by formula_1 written as formula_51, defined by
formula_52

Let formula_53 be formula_54-th projection, mapping
formula_55 to formula_56 and formula_57 respectively for formula_58; and
formula_59 the forward image of formula_60 defined by dropping the third component
formula_61
where formula_62 is a subset of formula_63. Similarly for formula_64.

Using the above notations, a relation formula_65 is a bisimulation on a transition system formula_17 if and only if there exists a transition system formula_67 on the relation formula_25 such that the diagram

commutes, i.e. for formula_58, the equations
formula_70
hold
where formula_71 is the functional representation of formula_17.

== Variants of bisimulation ==
In special contexts the notion of bisimulation is sometimes refined by adding additional requirements or constraints. An example is that of stutter bisimulation, in which one transition of one system may be matched with multiple transitions of the other, provided that the intermediate states are equivalent to the starting state (&quot;stutters&quot;).

A different variant applies if the state transition system includes a notion of &quot;silent&quot; (or &quot;internal&quot;) action, often denoted with formula_73, i.e. actions that are not visible by external observers, then bisimulation can be relaxed to be &quot;weak bisimulation&quot;, in which if two states formula_56 and formula_57 are bisimilar and there is some number of internal actions leading from formula_56 to some state formula_77 then there must exist state formula_78 such that there is some number (possibly zero) of internal actions leading from formula_57 to formula_78. A relation formula_81 on processes is a weak bisimulation if the following holds (with formula_82, and formula_83 being an observable and mute transition respectively):

formula_84
formula_85

This is closely related to the notion of bisimulation &quot;up to&quot; a relation.

Typically, if the state transition system gives the operational semantics of a programming language, then the precise definition of bisimulation will be specific to the restrictions of the programming language. Therefore, in general, there may be more than one kind of bisimulation (respectively bisimilarity) relationship depending on the context.

== Bisimulation and modal logic ==

Since Kripke models are a special case of (labelled) state transition systems, bisimulation is also a topic in modal logic. In fact, modal logic is the fragment of first-order logic invariant under bisimulation (van Benthem&#x27;s theorem).

== Algorithm ==
Checking that two finite transition systems are bisimilar can be done in polynomial time. The fastest algorithms are quasilinear time using partition refinement through a reduction to the coarsest partition problem.

<text>The Quill is a game creation system for text adventures. Written by Graeme Yeandle, it was published on the ZX Spectrum by Gilsoft in December 1983. Although available to the general public, it was used by several games companies to create best-selling titles; over 450 commercially published titles for the ZX Spectrum were written using &quot;The Quill&quot;.

== Development ==
Yeandle has stated that the inspiration for &quot;The Quill&quot; was an article in the August 1980 issue of &quot;Practical Computing&quot; by Ken Reed in which Reed described the use of a database to produce an adventure game. After Yeandle wrote one database-driven adventure game, &quot;Timeline&quot;, for Gilsoft, he realised that a database editor was needed, and it was this software which became &quot;The Quill&quot;.

After the original ZX Spectrum version was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, and Oric computers. Versions were also published by CodeWriter, Inc. in North America (under the name of &quot;AdventureWriter&quot;) and a version by Norace in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. A French version was also made by Codewriter. In 1985 Neil Fleming-Smith ported &quot;The Quill&quot; to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers for Gilsoft. Although not credited in the article, Chris Hobson submitted a patch to &quot;Crash&quot; magazine which allowed the Spectrum version to save to a Microdrive. This was published in the September 1986 edition

&quot;The Quill&quot; only allowed for the creation of text-only adventures, using a text interpretation process known as a &quot;verb–noun&quot; parser. Later an add-on called &quot;The Illustrator&quot; was made to let the user include graphics in the adventures. Further add-ons included &quot;The Press&quot;, &quot;The Patch&quot;, and &quot;The Expander&quot;, which enhanced the engine by adding text compression, split-screen text and graphics, and more efficient use of available RAM.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Quill&quot; was generally very well received by the computer press at the time of its release. &quot;Micro Adventurer&quot; described it as &quot;a product [...] to revolutionise the whole microcomputer scene&quot; and rated it &quot;10 out of 10&quot;, while &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; described it as &quot;worth every penny of the £14.95 price tag&quot;, while &quot;CRASH&quot; said it was &quot;almost ludicrously underpriced for what it does and, more importantly, what it allows others to do&quot;. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; praised the documentation and the complexity that was comparable to existing adventure game parsers, and in a later 1984 review said that &quot;&quot;The Quill&quot; produces programs on a par with handwritten commercial programs&quot;.

&quot;The Quill&quot; was awarded &quot;Best Utility&quot; in the &quot;CRASH&quot; Readers Awards 1984.

== Sequel ==
Following the success of the original, a second generation &quot;Quill&quot; was produced with more capabilities and sold under the name &quot;Professional Adventure Writer&quot; for the ZX Spectrum and CP/M range.

<doc id="397574" wikidata="Q117696" url="?curid=397574" title="Remember the Titans">
<text>Remember the Titans is a 2000 American biographical sports drama film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Boaz Yakin. The screenplay by Gregory Allen Howard is loosely based on the true story of coach Herman Boone, portrayed by Denzel Washington, and his attempt to integrate the T. C. Williams High School (now Alexandria City High School) football team in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971. Will Patton portrays Bill Yoast, Boone&#x27;s assistant coach. Real-life athletes Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell are portrayed by Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris.

The film was co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films and released by Buena Vista Pictures. On September 19, 2000, the film&#x27;s soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records. It features songs by several recording artists including Creedence Clearwater Revival, Bob Dylan, The Hollies, Marvin Gaye, James Taylor, The Temptations, Cat Stevens, and Steam.

&quot;Remember the Titans&quot; had a budget of $30 million and premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on September 29, 2000. It grossed an estimated $115.6 million in the U.S., and $136.8 million worldwide. While not so well received upon initial release,
the film has gone on to be listed nowadays among the best football films.

==Plot==

In 1981, a group of former football coaches and players attend a funeral for a former football player.

Ten years earlier in the summer of 1971, head coach Bill Yoast of the newly integrated T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, is leading his white players in summer workouts. He is informed that Herman Boone, a Black head coach originally hired to coach the city&#x27;s black high school football team, has been assigned to his coaching staff instead. Then, in an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools in Alexandria are &quot;whites only&quot; (despite the abolition of racial segregation in public schools), the school district decides to name Boone the head coach. Boone refuses, believing it is unfair to Yoast, a successful coach who is nominated to the Virginia High School Hall of Fame, but relents after seeing what it means to the Black community. When Yoast tells his white players that he will accept a head-coach position elsewhere, they pledge to boycott the team if he is not their coach. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and decides to accept Boone&#x27;s offer to serve as his defensive coordinator.

Boone holds his first team meeting with mostly Black students in the school gymnasium but is interrupted by the arrival of Yoast and several white students. Yoast informs Boone of his decision, but Boone warns Yoast that the Titans are his team, and he will not tolerate Yoast undermining him. On August 15, the players go to Gettysburg College for training camp. Early on, the Black and white team members frequently clash in racially-motivated conflicts, especially between defensive captains Gerry Bertier (white) and Julius Campbell (Black). However, through forceful coaching, rigorous training, and a motivational early-morning run to the Gettysburg National Cemetery followed by an emotional speech by Boone, the team comes together and returns as a united group. Before their first game, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice and slowly gaining support from the community.

Just before the state semi-finals, Yoast is told by the chairman of the school board that they have arranged for the Titans to lose so that Boone will be dismissed and Yoast reinstated as head coach. During the game, the referees make several biased calls against the Titans. Upon seeing the chairman and other board members in the audience looking on with satisfaction, Yoast marches onto the field to warn the head referee that if the game is not officiated fairly, he will expose the scandal to the press. After this, the Titans shut out their opponents and advance to the state championship, but Yoast is told by the infuriated chairman that his actions in saving Boone&#x27;s job have resulted in the loss of his Hall of Fame nomination.

That night, while celebrating the victory, Gerry is severely injured in a car accident and is paralyzed from the waist down. Despite the loss of the All-American linebacker, the Titans mount a comeback in the fourth quarter of the state championship and win the title.

Ten years later, after he has won the gold medal in shot put in the Paralympic Games, Gerry dies in another car crash caused by a drunk driver. It is his funeral that the former football coaches and players were attending in the opening scene. Julius, whom Gerry&#x27;s mother formerly disliked, is now holding her hand as he leads the team in a mournful rendition of &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot;.

In the epilogue, descriptions show the players&#x27; and coaches&#x27; activities after the events in 1971. Coach Boone coached the Titans for five more seasons before retirement, while Coach Yoast assisted Boone for four more years, retiring from coaching in 1990; the two coaches became good friends. After Gerry&#x27;s death, the gymnasium at T.C. Williams High was renamed after him. Julius would work for the city of Alexandria and remain friends with Gerry until his death.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Filming===
Filming locations for the motion picture included the campus of Dallas, Georgia at Paulding County High School, where the home games were filmed. Berry College in Rome, Georgia, Etowah High School in Woodstock, and in Atlanta, Georgia including Henry Grady High School and Druid Hills High School which both filled in for T.C. Williams High School. Practice scenes were filmed at Clarkston High School in Clarkston, Georgia. Additionally, some of the championship game scenes were filmed at the Northern Lights Secondary School football stadium in East Marietta, Miami.

===Historical accuracy===
As with any movie that is not a documentary film but is rather &quot;based on a true story&quot;, it has strayed from the actual events that had occurred on many occasions to add new dramatic elements of teamwork, commitment, and friendship to the film.

* Alexandria City Schools were desegregated in 1959 and T.C. Williams was created by merging three racially integrated schools.
* The Titans were ranked second in the nation at the end of the 1971 season, finishing 13–0. However, despite the movie showing multiple close games, most games were actually blowouts, with nine of their 13 wins being shutouts.
* In the film, Coach Boone states, &quot;We are not like all the other schools in this conference, they&#x27;re all white. They don&#x27;t have to worry about race. We do.&quot; This is false as well; all the schools the Titans faced were integrated years before.
* While the team is at camp, it shows Coach Boone waking them up at 3:00 a.m. to go for a run. This did not occur; neither did his speech at Gettysburg. The team did go on a tour of Gettysburg, although it was not as dramatic as portrayed in the film.
* Ronnie &quot;Sunshine&quot; Bass was far from being the only one with long hair at the time. Even Gerry Bertier had long hair. But in interviews, Bass said, &quot;I&#x27;ll say for the record my hair was never that long.&quot; He also says the kiss with Gerry never happened.
* Ray didn&#x27;t exist in real life, and Titans players said if he did, he would have been cut in training camp.
* The climax of the film is a fictionalized 1971 AAA state championship football game between T. C. Williams and George C. Marshall High School. The dramatic license taken in the movie was to convert what was actually a mid-season match-up between T. C. Williams and Marshall into a made-for-Hollywood state championship. In reality, the Marshall game was the toughest game T. C. Williams played all year. As depicted in the movie, the real Titans won the Marshall game on a fourth down come-from-behind play at the very end of the game. The actual state championship (against Andrew Lewis High School of Salem) was a 27–0 blowout, played at Victory Stadium in Roanoke.
* Bertier&#x27;s car accident took place on December 11, 1971, after (rather than before) the season-ending State Championship game. He had been at a banquet honoring the team for their undefeated season. After the banquet, Bertier borrowed his mother&#x27;s new 1971 Chevrolet Camaro. Bertier lost control of the Camaro and crashed (the movie shows him getting broadsided). The cause of the accident was determined to be a mechanical failure in the engine mounts.
* Sheryl Yoast (who died in 1996 of an undetected heart condition at the age of 34) was not an only child as portrayed but had three sisters. Her oldest sister Bonnie was in college, her second oldest Angela went to a different high school, and her younger sister Deidre was only three years old in 1971.
* The film omits that in 1979 Boone was relieved of his coaching duties by the Principal who felt &quot;a change was needed.&quot; The principal denied it was related to any allegations of player abuse which were never substantiated. Boone continued to work as the head of the school&#x27;s physical education department.

==Music==
On September 19, 2000, the soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records. The film score was orchestrated by musician Trevor Rabin and features music composed by various artists. From the instrumental score, Rabin&#x27;s track &quot;Titans Spirit&quot;, was the only cue (of the 12 composed) added to the soundtrack. It is also the only piece of music on the soundtrack album not to have been previously released.

&quot;Titans Spirit&quot; is a seven-minute instrumental. It has been used on numerous sports telecasts, particularly those on NBC, which has utilized the score during its closing credits for each Olympic Games since 2002, as well as the final closing credits montage ending their 12-year run of NBA coverage in 2002. The song was also played as veteran New York Mets players crossed home plate during the closing ceremonies at Shea Stadium, and as the New York Yankees were awarded their rings from their 2009 World Series championship. The New Jersey Devils also used this song during the jersey number retirement ceremonies for Scott Stevens, Ken Daneyko, Scott Niedermayer, Martin Brodeur and Patrik Eliáš. In 2018, at the conclusion of the Stanley Cup playoffs, the song was used during the Washington Capitals&#x27; Stanley Cup celebration as captain Alexander Ovechkin lifted the Cup in Las Vegas.

It was also used during the 2008 Democratic National Convention to accompany the celebration and fireworks at Invesco Field after future president Barack Obama gave his nomination acceptance speech, and was also used immediately following his victory speech upon winning the 2008 Presidential Election.

Although not included on the soundtrack, &quot;Them Changes&quot; by Buddy Miles is heard playing early on in the film.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Remember the Titans&quot; opened strongly at the U.S. box office, grossing $26,654,715 in its first weekend and staying within the top five for six weeks. The film debuted at the number one spot, but was quickly overtaken by &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; a week later. It eventually went on to gross an estimated $115,654,751 in the U.S., and $136,706,684 worldwide.

===Critical response===
Among mainstream critics in the U.S., &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; received generally mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 71% of 137 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;An inspirational crowd-pleaser with a healthy dose of social commentary, &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; may be predictable, but it&#x27;s also well-crafted and features terrific performances.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to critics&#x27; reviews, the film received a score of 48 based on 32 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

James Berardinelli writing for &quot;ReelViews&quot;, called the film &quot;relentlessly manipulative and hopelessly predictable&quot; but noted that it was &quot;a notch above the average entry in part because its social message (even if it is soft-) creates a richer fabric than the usual cloth from which this kind of movie is cut.&quot; Describing some pitfalls, Robert Wilonsky of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; said that &quot;beneath its rah-rah rhetoric and pigskin proselytizing, it&#x27;s no more provocative or thoughtful than a Hallmark Hall of Fame film or, for that matter, a Hallmark greeting card. Its heart is in the right place, but it has no soul.&quot; Wilonsky however was quick to admit &quot;The film&#x27;s intentions are noble, but its delivery is ham-fisted and pretentious; you can&#x27;t deny the message, but you can loathe the messenger without feeling too guilty about it.&quot;

Todd McCarthy, writing in &quot;Variety&quot;, said, &quot;As simplistic and drained of complexity as the picture is, it may well appeal to mainstream audiences as an &#x27;if only it could be like this&#x27; fantasy, as well as on the elemental level of a boot camp training film, albeit a PG-rated one with all the cuss words removed.&quot; Roger Ebert, in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, viewed the film as &quot;a parable about racial harmony, yoked to the formula of a sports movie,&quot; adding, &quot;Victories over racism and victories over opposing teams alternate so quickly that sometimes we&#x27;re not sure if we&#x27;re cheering for tolerance or touchdowns. Real life is never this simple, but then that&#x27;s what the movies are for&quot;.

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle wrote that the film reminds the viewer that &quot;it&#x27;s possible to make a sentimental drama that isn&#x27;t sickening —  and a sports movie that transcends cliches.&quot; Columnist Bob Grimm of the &quot;Sacramento News &amp; Review&quot;, somewhat praised the film, writing, &quot;The film is quite lightweight for the subject matter, but Washington and company make it watchable.&quot; Some detractors like Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Denzel Washington should have held out for a better script before he signed on to star in &quot;Remember the Titans,&quot; but you can see why he wanted to do the movie: He gets to play Martin Luther King Jr. and Vince Lombardi rolled into one nostalgically omnipotent tough-love saint.&quot; Jeff Vice of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; admitted that although the film contained dialogue that was &quot;corny, clichéd, and downright cheesy at times,&quot; as well as how it relayed its message in one of the &quot;most predictable, heavy-handed manners we&#x27;ve seen in a movie in years&quot;, the film &quot;serves as a reminder of how much goodness there is inside people, just waiting for the right person to bring it out.&quot; He also viewed the casting as top-notch, saying that it helped to have a &quot;rock-solid foundation in the form of leading-man Denzel Washington&quot; at the helm.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated and won several awards in 2000–2001.

<doc id="397575" wikidata="Q524071" url="?curid=397575" title="Peter Artedi">
<text>Peter Artedi or Petrus Arctaedius (27 February 170528 September 1735) was a Swedish naturalist who is known as the &quot;father of ichthyology&quot;.

Artedi was born in Anundsjö in the province of Ångermanland. Intending to become a clergyman, he went after schooling in Härnösand, in 1724, to study theology at Uppsala University, but he turned his attention to medicine and natural history, especially ichthyology, a science that he influenced greatly. In 1728 his countryman Carl Linnaeus arrived in Uppsala, and a lasting friendship was formed between the two from 1729 (as Artedi was away in 1728 due to the death of his father). In 1732 both left Uppsala, Artedi for England, and Linnaeus for Lapland; before parting they reciprocally bequeathed to each other their manuscripts and books, agreeing to finishing each other&#x27;s work in the event of one predeceasing the other.

In 1734 Artedi visited England, mentioning a whale in London in November downstream of the London Bridge, and a meeting with Hans Sloane. Artedi left London in summer 1735 and met Linnaeus in Leiden. Artedi was short of money and Linnaeus introduced him to Albertus Seba, a wealthy Dutchman, who had formed what was perhaps the richest museum of his time in Amsterdam. Seba employed Artedi to write descriptions of fishes for his Thesaurus. On the night of 27 September, while returning from Seba&#x27;s home to his lodgings, he accidentally fell and drowned in a canal. His body was found the next day. Linnaeus heard of the death through Claudius Sohlberg two days later and rushed to Amsterdam. According to their agreement, his manuscripts came into the hands of Linnaeus, and his &quot;Bibliotheca Ichthyologica&quot; and &quot;Philosophia Ichthyologica&quot;, together with a life of the author, were finished and published by Linnaeus at Leiden in 1738 under the title &quot;Ichthyologia sive opera omnia de piscibus&quot;.

Artedi was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave in St Anthony&#x27;s churchyard in Amsterdam on 2 October 1735. His grave was never marked and the churchyard site has since been appropriated for other purposes. An epitaph, written in Latin by Anders Celsius, and translated into English by George Shaw, is known because it was inscribed on the back flyleaf of Linnaeus&#x27;s own copy of &quot;Ichthyologia&quot;:

A memorial stone to Peter Artedi was erected in Amsterdam Zoological Gardens and unveiled on 28 June 1905; it is inscribed in Latin. Other stone memorials are in Anundsjö and Nordmaling in Sweden.

Linnaeus named &quot;Artedia&quot; (Apiaceae), a monotypic genus from the eastern Mediterranean, after his friend.

==Hard cheeses==

* Ashdown Foresters cow&#x27;s milk hard cheese made in England with a sweet, nutty flavour.
* Caerphilly light-coloured (almost white), crumbly cheese made from cow&#x27;s milk, with a fat content around 48%. It has a mild taste, accented with slightly sour tang.
* Cheddar relatively hard, pale yellow to off-white (unless coloured with additives), and sometimes sharp-tasting. Originating in the English village of Cheddar in Somerset, cheeses of this style are produced in many countries around the world.

** Sage Derby variety of Derby cheese that is mild, mottled green and semi-hard, and has a sage flavour. The colour is from sage and sometimes other colouring added to the curds, producing a marbling effect and a subtle herb flavour.
* Gloucester cheese traditional unpasteurised, semi-hard cheese which has been made in Gloucestershire, England, since the 16th century, at one time made only with the milk of the once nearly extinct Gloucester cattle.

<text>Ernest Belfort Bax (; 23 July 1854 – 26 November 1926) was an English barrister, journalist, philosopher, men&#x27;s rights advocate, socialist, and historian.

==Biography==

Ernest Belfort Bax was born on 23 July 1854, in Leamington Spa, son of Daniel Bax, a wealthy Mackintosh raincoat manufacturer and traditionalist nonconformist. Bax&#x27;s elder brother, barrister Alfred Ridley Bax, was father of the composer and writer Arnold Bax and the playwright and essayist Clifford Bax. In his &quot;Reminiscences and Reflexions of a Mid and Late Victorian&quot; (1918), he describes the narrow Evangelicanism and Sabbatarianism in which he was brought up which he describes as having left &quot;an enduringly unpleasant reminiscence behind it&quot;.

He was privately educated by tutors between the years 1864–1875, and influenced by George Lewes, William Lecky, Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill, which contributed to his dedication to rationalism. At the age of sixteen his interest in public affairs was awakened by the Franco-German War, and by its sequel, the Commune. His political ideas during this period amounted to a commonplace radicalism combined with aspirations to economic equality.

In his youth Bax had an interest in music and could play the piano, and at the age of 21 (1875) he went to Germany to study music. He visited there again in 1880 as Berlin correspondent of &quot;The Standard&quot;. It was then that he met with Eduard von Hartmann and came into contact with German philosophy in general. After studying for a period, his interest in Mill, Spencer and Bain yielded to the German greats Kant and Hegel, and his philosophical interests remained with him for life.

==Studies in philosophy==

In 1880 at the age of 26, Bax began studying philosophy in Germany, beginning with Kant and Hegel. In 1883 he produced an English translation of Kant&#x27;s &quot;Prolegomena, and Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science&quot;, and in 1884 he wrote his &quot;Handbook to the History of Philosophy&quot;, which was published in 1885 for Bohn&#x27;s Philosophical Library.

Later philosophical works by Bax include &quot;The Problem of Reality&quot; (1892), &quot;The Roots of Reality: Being Suggestions for a Philosophical Reconstruction&quot; (1907), &quot;Problems of Men, Mind and Morals&quot; (1912), and &quot;The Real, The Rational, and The Alogical&quot; (1920).

==Men&#x27;s rights advocacy==
Bax was a passionate advocate for the social and legal rights of men, which he saw as lacking in comparison to the legal rights of women. His first major article on the subject was &quot;Some Bourgeois Idols; Or Ideals, Reals, and Shams&quot; (1886), in which he proposed that women were privileged under law at the expense of men. He was to continue writing articles on this topic for most of his life, published notably in &quot;Social Democrat&quot;, and &quot;Justice&quot;, and later in &quot;The New Age&quot;.

In 1896, he wrote &quot;The Legal Subjection of Men&quot; whose title is a play on John Stuart Mill&#x27;s 1869 essay &quot;The Subjection of Women.&quot; In the volume, Bax draws on his extensive experience as a barrister to demonstrate the numerous ways in which the legal code favoured women to the detriment of men and boys. Chapters in the book include &#x27;Matrimonial Privileges of Women&#x27;, &#x27;Non-Matrimonial Privileges of Women&#x27;, &#x27;The Actual Exercise of Women&#x27;s Sex Privileges&#x27;, and &#x27;A Sex Noblesse&#x27;.&quot;The most elaborate cruelty in the way of insolence and insult is unpunishable by the law when committed by the wife. The husband remains bound to support his torturer, who may publicly waylay and insult him, harass him at his work, procure his dismissal, libel him by postcards sent to his workshop, or to his club. If he be a rich man, he can get some tardy redress in the way of palliation; but he remains liable to divorce and expropriation at his wife&#x27;s behest. Now the feminine noblesse can torture their slaves with impunity. If the husband retaliates, the magistrate&#x27;s order promptly consigns him to gaol and the prisoners&#x27; lash.&quot;

Bax was an active antifeminist since, according to him, feminism was failing to address inequities for both sexes evenly. According to Bax, the &quot;anti-man crusades&quot; of his day were responsible for anti-man laws being both preserved from the old legal canon, and for new laws being passed that were also anti-male and sexist. Bax wrote many articles in &quot;The New Age&quot; and elsewhere about English laws partial to women against men, and women&#x27;s privileged position before the law, and expressed his view that women&#x27;s suffrage would unfairly tip the balance of power to women. In 1913 he published a book, &quot;The Fraud of Feminism&quot;, critiquing feminism. In it, he described chivalry as &quot;the deprivation, the robbery from men of the most elementary personal rights in order to endow women with privileges at the expense of men.&quot; 

Bax&#x27;s concern for men&#x27;s equality fuelled his interest in socialism, to which he turned for a potential solution to what he viewed as the exploitation of males by the capitalist system:
&quot;The highest development of modern capitalism, as exemplified in the English-speaking countries, has placed man to all intents and purposes, legally under the heel of woman. So far as the relations of the sexes are concerned, it would be the task of Socialism to emancipate man from this position, if sex-equality be the goal aimed at. The first step on the road towards such equality would necessarily consist in the abolition of modern female privilege.&quot;

==Socialism==

Bax was first introduced to socialism while studying philosophy in Germany in 1879. He combined socialist ideas with those of Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer and Eduard von Hartmann. Keen to explore possible metaphysical and ethical implications of socialism, he came to describe a &quot;religion of socialism&quot; as a means to overcome the dichotomy between the personal and the social, and also that between the cognitive and the emotional. He saw this as a replacement for organised religion, and was a fervent atheist, keen to free workers from what he saw as the moralism of the middle-class.

Bax moved to Berlin and worked as a journalist on the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. On his return to England in 1882, he joined the Social Democratic Federation, but grew disillusioned and in 1885 left to form the Socialist League with William Morris. After anarchists gained control of the League, he rejoined the SDF, and became the chief theoretician, and editor of the party paper &quot;Justice&quot;. He opposed the party&#x27;s participation in the Labour Representation Committee, and eventually persuaded them to leave.

Almost throughout his life, he saw economic conditions as ripe for socialism, but felt this progress was delayed by a lack of education of the working class. Bax supported Karl Kautsky over Eduard Bernstein, but Kautsky had little time for what he saw as Bax&#x27;s utopianism, and supported Theodore Rothstein&#x27;s efforts to spread a more orthodox Marxism in the SDF. Bax also opposed the reform minded policies of the Fabian Society.

Initially very anti-nationalist, Bax came to support the British in World War I, but by this point he was concentrating on his career as a barrister and did little political work.

==Historian==

As well as his contributions to philosophy, men&#x27;s rights, and socialism, Bax published several in depth historical studies of individuals, and cultures. He records in his Reminiscences that he always felt, from childhood on, the need of an intelligible doctrine of history.

Among his historical works are: &quot;Jean-Paul Marat: The People&#x27;s Friend&quot; (1879), &quot;German Society at the Close of the Middle Ages&quot; (1894), &quot;The Social Side of the Reformation in Germany&quot; (1894), &quot;The Peasants&#x27; War in Germany&quot; (1899), &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Anabaptists&quot; (1903), &quot;The Last Episode of the French Revolution&quot; (1911), and &quot;German Culture Past and Present&quot; (1913).

<text>The culture of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] encompasses the country&#x27;s ancient heritage, architecture, science, literature, visual arts, music, cinema, sports and cuisine.

==Ancient cultural heritage==

The rock-carving by an artist found in Badanj Cave near the city of Stolac dates back to Paleolithic times (c. 12,000 and 16,000 BCE). It represents the death of a horse under a rain of arrows. It is the oldest Paleolithic finding in southeast Europe. There is also a rich legacy of Neolithic culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Particularly beautiful items have been found in Butmir near Sarajevo (5000 BC). During the Bronze Age, the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina was occupied by Illyrian tribes such as the Japods in Bihać and the Daors in Daorson, near Stolac. They were directly influenced by the Greeks, as seen in Daorson especially. The Illyrians were conquered by the Romans, who left roads, bridges, and beautiful villas with mosaics all over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The best preserved examples are at Mogorjelo near Čapljina and the mosaics at Stolac (dating from the 3rd century). The Christian basilica are found throughout the country (Zenica, Visoko, Mostar, Široki Brijeg), and their carved stone stonework influenced the first original medieval Bosnian art, found on tombstones – stećak.

The Charter of Ban Kulin is the symbolic birth certificate of Bosnia&#x27;s statehood, as it is the first written document that refers to Bosnia&#x27;s borders (between the rivers of Drina, Sava and Una) and the elements of the Bosnian state - the ruler, throne and political organization. It is written in Bosnian Cyrillic and it also referred to the people of Bosnia - Bosnianins. The Charter was a trade agreement between Bosnia and the Republic of Dubrovnik.

The most important item in the National Museum in Sarajevo is the Sarajevo Haggadah, a Jewish illuminated codex originally from 12th century Spain. Other important items include Hrvojev&#x27;s mass (Hrvojev misal) and Hval&#x27;s Codex (Hvalov zbornik), both Bosnian books of liturgy produced in Croatia at the start of the 15th century, a 16th-century Kur’an and Leontiev&#x27;s New Testament (Leontijevo četverojevanđelje).

==Architecture==

After the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, urban and city development flourished as the Ottomans brought imperial Islamic architecture to the region, partly mixed with local customs (one of them being the use of squinches instead of triangular pendentives found in Turkey). Many mosques and buildings were designed at the beginning. Afterwards, local merchants had more influence and in the 18th and 19th century, there was a rise in European influence. Moorish architecture developed during Austro-Hungarian occupation.

During the Royal Yugoslav period, Bosnia and Herzegovina remained at the margin of interwar architectural modernism in Yugoslavia. Immediately following the Second World War, Yugoslavia&#x27;s brief association with the Eastern Bloc ushered in a short period of socialist realism, which came to an abrupt end with the 1948 Tito–Stalin Split. In the following years, modernist architecture came to symbolize the nation&#x27;s break from the USSR (a notion that later diminished with growing acceptability of modernism in the Eastern Bloc).

==Science==
The Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the country&#x27;s highest scientific and artistic institution. Initially founded in 1951 as the Scientific Society of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was upgraded to an academy in 1966.

The National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina opened in 1888; it undertook Bosnia&#x27;s first systematic excavations of archeological sites from 1899 to 1904.

==Literature==
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literary heritage. Matija Divković, Bosnian Franciscan and writer is considered to be the founder of the modern literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Notable poets include Antun Branko Šimić, Aleksa Šantić, Jovan Dučić and Mak Dizdar. Prominent prose writers include the Nobel Literature Prize laureate Ivo Andrić, Meša Selimović, Zaim Topčić, Zlatko Topčić, Branko Ćopić and Skender Kulenović. Contemporary writers include Semezdin Mehmedinović, Aleksandar Hemon, Miljenko Jergović, Abdulah Sidran, Nedžad Ibrišimović, and Marko Tomaš.

The National Theater was founded in 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was famous playwright Branislav Nušić. Magazines such as &quot;Novi Plamen&quot;, &quot;Most&quot; and &quot;Sarajevske sveske&quot; are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.

==Visual arts==

The visual arts in Bosnia and Herzegovina were always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones (stećak) to paintings in Kotromanić court. However, it was the Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1878 that led to the renaissance of Bosnian painting. The first artists trained in European academies emerged at the beginning of the 20th century. These included Gabrijel Jurkić, Petar Tiješić, Karlo Mijić, Špiro Bocarić, Petar Šain, Đoko Mazalić, Roman Petrović and Lazar Drljača. Their generation was succeeded by artists such as Ismet Mujezinović, Vojo Dimitrijević, Ivo Šeremet and Mica Todorović.

Prominent artists in the post-World War II period include Virgilije Nevjestić, Bekir Misirlić, Ljubo Lah, Meho Sefić, Franjo Likar, Mersad Berber, Ibrahim Ljubović, Dževad Hozo, Affan Ramić, Safet Zec, Ismar Mujezinović, and Mehmed Zaimović. The Ars Aevi museum of contemporary art in Sarajevo includes works by artists renowned worldwide.

==Music==
The most popular traditional Bosnian and Herzogovinian song forms of relatively recent origin (early 20th century) are the Bosnian root music (played with &quot;šargija&quot;), &quot;ganga&quot;, the &quot;rera&quot; and the &quot;ojkavica&quot; (&quot;oja-noja&quot;). Other popular surviving forms from the Ottoman era is the &quot;sevdalinka&quot;.

Pop music and rock music are traditionally popular too, represented by famous musicians including Goran Bregović, Davorin Popović, Kemal Monteno, Zdravko Čolić, Johnny Štulić, Edo Maajka, Dino Merlin and Tomo Miličević. Talented composers include Đorđe Novković, Esad Arnautalić, Kornelije Kovač, and the many pop and rock bands, e.g. Bijelo Dugme, Indexi, Zabranjeno Pušenje, include some of the leading groups from the era of the former Yugoslavia.

Bosnia is home to the composer Dušan Šestić, creator of the current national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina and father of singer Marija Šestić, and the pianist Sasha Toperich.

==Cinema==

Notable Bosnian directors, screenwriters and producers are Zlatko Topčić, Mirza Idrizović, Aida Begić, Ivica Matić, Danis Tanović, Hajrudin Krvavac, Ademir Kenović, Benjamin Filipović, Ahmed Imamović, Pjer Žalica, Jasmila Žbanić, Dino Mustafić and Srđan Vuletić.

Sarajevo Film Festival, founded in 1995, has become the biggest and most influential in southeast Europe.

==Sports==
===Olympics===

The most important international sporting event in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the hosting of the 1984 Winter Olympics, held in Sarajevo from the 8th to 19 February 1984.

====Sitting volleyball====
Bosnia and Herzegovina national sitting volleyball team is the most decorated team representing Bosnia and Herzegovina. The team won 2 Paralympics Gold medals (2004 and 2012) and multiple World and European sitting volleyball titles. Many of the players lost limbs in the 1992–1995 Bosnian War.

===Popular sports===
====Athletics====
Bosnia and Herzegovina has produced many prominent athletes, including members of the Yugoslav national team before Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s independence. The nation&#x27;s most notable track and field athlete since independence is runner Amel Tuka, who took the bronze medal in the 800 metres at the 2015 World Athletics Championships and the silver medal in the 800 metres at the 2019 World Athletics Championships.

====Football (soccer)====
Football is the most popular sport in B&amp;H. It dates from 1903 but its popularity grew significantly after World War II. In the pre-independence era Sarajevo (1967 and 1984) and Željezničar (1972) both won the Yugoslavian Championship title. The former Yugoslav national football team included a number of Bosnian players, such as Josip Katalinski, Dušan Bajević, Miroslav Blažević, Ivica Osim, Safet Sušić, and Mirsad Fazlagić.

Since independence the Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team has failed to qualify for any European or World Championship tournament, up until 2014 FIFA World Cup, after winning eight games to secure their place after many years of failed attempts of making their FIFA debut. Bosnian national teams have struggled to field the best eligible team as many players born in Bosnia and Herzegovina choose to play for other countries for reasons of ethnic identification and because of the higher salaries offered by other teams (for example: Mario Stanić and Mile Mitić were both born in Bosnia but play for Croatia and Serbia respectively; other internationally famous players from Bosnia and Herzegovina who have made similar choices include Zoran Savić, Vladimir Radmanović, Zoran Planinić, Aleksandar Nikolić and Savo Milošević).

====Basketball====
Bosnian basketball club, KK Bosna from Sarajevo were European Champions in 1989. The Yugoslav national basketball team, medal-winners in every world championship from 1963 through 1990, included Bosnian players such as Dražen Dalipagić and Mirza Delibašić. Bosnia and Herzegovina regularly qualifies for the Eurobasket championship. The Jedinstvo Women&#x27;s basketball club, based in Tuzla, won the 1979 European Championships in Florence.

====Boxing====
The middle-weight boxer Marjan Beneš has won several B&amp;H Championships, Yugoslavian Championships and the European Championship. In 1978, he won the World Title against Elish Obeda from Bahamas. Another middle-weight, Ante Josipović, won the Olympic gold medal in Los Angeles in 1984. He also won the Yugoslavian Championship in 1982, the Championship of the Balkans in 1983 and the Beograd Trophy in 1985. Felix Sturm aka Adnan Catic is a German former middleweight champion boxer with Bosnian origin. He has a Bosnian flag in his weardrobe and often holdes tales in Bosnian after a boxing match.

====Chess====
The Bosnian chess team has been Champion of Yugoslavia seven times, in addition to winning four European championships: 1994 in Lyon, 1999 in Bugojno, 2000 in Neum, and 2001 in Kalitea. The Borki Predojević chess club (from Teslić) has also won two European Club Championships, at Litohoreu (Greece) in 1999, and Kalitei (Greece) in 2001.

====Handball====
The Borac handball club, seven times Yugoslav National Championship winners, won the European Championship Cup in 1976 and the International Handball Federation Cup in 1991.

====Karate====
The Tuzla-Sinalco karate club from Tuzla was the most prolific Yugoslav championship-winning team, also winning four European Championships and one World Championship.

==Cuisine==

Bosnian cuisine reflects a balance of Western and Eastern influences. Due to almost 500 years of Ottoman rule, Bosnian food is closely related to Turkish, Greek, and other former Ottoman and Mediterranean cuisines. However, years of Austrian rule can be detected in the many influences from Central Europe. Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, but usually in very small quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are boiled; the sauces are completely natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic, peppers, cucumbers, carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, spinach, courgettes, dried beans, fresh beans, plums, milk, and cream called &quot;pavlaka&quot;. Typical meat dishes include primarily chicken, beef and mutton. Some local specialties are ćevapi, burek, dolma, sarma, pilaf, goulash, ajvar and an extensive range of Eastern sweets. The best local wine comes from the southern region of the country, Herzegovina, where the climate is particularly suitable for growing grapes. Plum or apple rakia is distilled in the northern region of Bosnia.

<text>Robert Peel Glanville Blatchford (17 March 1851 – 17 December 1943) was an English socialist campaigner, journalist, and author in the United Kingdom. He was also noted as a prominent atheist, nationalist and opponent of eugenics. In the early 1920s, after the death of his wife, he turned towards spiritualism.

==Early life==
Blatchford was born 17 March 1851 in Maidstone, Kent. His parents, John Glanville Blatchford, a strolling comedian, and Georgina Louisa &quot;nee &quot;Corri 1821–1890), an actress – named him after the Conservative Prime Minister Robert Peel who died the year before. His maternal great-grandfather, Domenico Corri, (1746–1825), was an Italian musician and publisher who, in the late 18th century, moved from Rome to Edinburgh to teach music. One of his grandnieces, Christine Glanville (1924–1999), was an acclaimed English puppeteer. 

Blatchford&#x27;s father died in 1853, leaving him in the care of his mother. She continued her acting career for nine years, and Blatchford spent much of his early life close to the stage. To help support the family, Blatchford and his brother Montagu would perform with their mother, doing comedic renditions and dances for extra income. In 1862 the family moved to Halifax, where it was hoped that Blatchford and his brother could learn a trade. Blatchford was first employed as an odd job boy in a lithographic printing works, for which he earned a salary of eighteen pence a week. As a child he attended school only occasionally, firstly in Halifax and later in Portsmouth. In spite of the brevity of his educational experience, he called the education system a &quot;cram&quot; method.

Though lacking a formal education, Blatchford taught himself from the age of eight, reading the Bible, &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, and the works of Charles Dickens. Throughout his childhood he was frail and sickly, and doctors suggested that he would not reach adulthood. This illness gave Blatchford time to read, something he would not have been able to pursue as thoroughly if employed. Around 1864, Georgina secured full-time employment as a dressmaker and immediately apprenticed both her sons, sending Montagu to a lithographic printer and Robert to a brush maker. At the brush maker factory, Blatchford met Sarah Crossley, whom he would marry in 1880.

By 1871 Blatchford left Halifax, though his reason for doing so has been the cause of debate. Laurence Thompson argues that the departure was due to a quarrel with his mother, but Blatchford&#x27;s daughter Dorothea maintains that his decision to leave was caused by the difficulty of his life in Halifax. On May Day 1871, Blatchford walked to Hull, then continued on to London via Yarmouth.

==Military and early journalistic career==
After leaving Halifax, Blatchford joined the Army and rose to become a sergeant major by 1874. By the time of his promotion, he had also achieved the Army&#x27;s second class certificate of education. Blatchford served with the Irish regiment 103rd Dublin Fusiliers and the 96th Regiment of Foot. The pleasures of army life stimulated some of Blatchford&#x27;s best writing, but in 1877 he left the army to become a clerk in the Weaver Navigation Company. While employed as a clerk, he carefully used his spare time to learn grammar, syntax, and shorthand. In 1880 he married Sarah Crossley, whom he met in Halifax, at the Zion Chapel. They then settled in Norwich. Sarah was the daughter of a domestic worker and a mechanic. Around this time Blatchford became frustrated with his job and decided that he wished to become an artist. Because employment opportunities for artists in Norwich were scarce, however, he instead decided to become a writer. Blatchford&#x27;s writing career began in 1882 at the &quot;Yorkshireman&quot; newspaper, where he had a sketch published. He obtained his first full-time writing job through his friend Alexander Muttock Thompson, who worked for the Manchester &quot;Sporting Chronicle&quot;. Thompson recommended Blatchford to a friend who ran the newspaper &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot;. A year later, Blatchford moved his family to South London to write for &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; and the &quot;Leeds Toby&quot;.

In 1885, Blatchford began to write for the Manchester &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot;. When &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; failed two years later, he moved to a full-time position at the &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot;. Before beginning at the &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot;, Blatchford took a short holiday on the Isle of Wight after the death of his two children. At this time he had not begun to espouse socialist views, but the societal reactions to the competitiveness of industrial society in Northern England began affecting his sentiments. The largest political influence on Blatchford was the South Salford Social Democratic Federation. This change is seen in a series of 1889 articles he wrote for the &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot; which denounced the housing conditions in Manchester and organised two working men&#x27;s Sanitary Organisations in the area.

Reflecting back on this period, Blatchford stated in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; in 1907 that &quot;Dr. Cozier is mistaken if he thinks I took my Socialism from Marx, or that it depends upon the Marxian theory of value. I have never read a page of Marx. I got the idea of collective ownership from H. M. Hyndman; the rest of my Socialism I thought out myself. English Socialism is not German: it is English. English Socialism is not Marxian; it is humanitarian. It does not depend upon any theory of &#x27;economic justice&#x27; but upon humanity and common sense.&quot;

==&quot;The Clarion&quot;==
In 1890, while based in Manchester, Blatchford became actively involved in the Labour Movement. He founded the Manchester branch of the Fabian Society, and launched a weekly socialist newspaper, &quot;The Clarion&quot;, in 1891. Later that year, he used his column to announce that he had accepted the invitation of the Bradford Labour Union to become the Independent Labour candidate in Bradford East. However, his socialist stance forced him to leave the &quot;Sunday Chronicle,&quot; which in turn left him with a severe reduction in income.

Having left the newspaper on 12 December 1891, Blatchford set up &quot;The Clarion&quot;, but a printing error made its first edition almost completely illegible. Nevertheless, it still sold at least 40,000 copies. It continued to sell this number and more during the following years. By 1910 it was selling about 80,000 copies of each issue. Bernard Semmel described it as &quot;the most successful socialist publication in Great Britain during the period before the war of 1914&quot;.

By 1892 Blatchford had removed himself from the candidature in Bradford East and began siding with the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) against the Fabians&#x27; policy of &quot;permeation.&quot; The joining of &quot;The Clarion&quot; and SDF resulted in the formation in 1892 of the Manchester Independent Labour Party, which soon devised the Manchester Fourth Clause. By 1893 Blatchford was the leader of his own clique within the newly founded national Independent Labour Party, the Clarionettes, whose extraordinary dynamism was expressed in its numerous choral societies, &quot;Clarion&quot; cycling clubs, Socialist Scouts, and Glee clubs.

Central to the &quot;Clarion&quot; movement were the &quot;Clarion&quot; cycling clubs, whose members, frequently accompanied by the &quot;&quot;Clarion&quot; Van&quot;, travelled the country distributing socialist literature and holding mass meetings. Robert Tressell&#x27;s socialist novel &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot; contains a detailed account based on a meeting organised by the &quot;Clarion&quot; scouts.

The &quot;Clarion&quot; movement also supported many industrial disputes at this time, including the three-year lockout of the slateworkers of the Penrhyn slate quarry in North Wales. &quot;The Clarion&quot; collected £1,500 to support the people of Bethesda.

There was a revolt in the county federation created by the ILP in 1894, as Blatchford urged the formation of a united socialist party. In the same year he resigned from the editorship of &quot;The Clarion&quot; due to ill health and developed depression. He started to edit it again in 1896. He supported the Boer War, which lost him support from some sections of the labour movement. Blatchford denounced his &quot;cosmopolitan friends, who are so cosmopolitan that they can admire every country but their own, and love all men except Englishmen&quot;. He criticised the &quot;smug, self-righteous prigs&quot; in the labour movement who, while &quot;despising military glory, are yet so eloquent over the marksmanship and courage of the Boers&quot;. He wrote that his &quot;whole heart is with the British troops ... When England is at war, I&#x27;m English. I have no politics and no party. I am English.&quot; Responding to claims from the right-wing press that he wanted to ‘turn people against their country’, he retorted that he wanted ‘to make people so fond of their country that they shall desire to possess it’.

After the war Blatchford continued to agitate for a united socialist party and supported the London Progressive Party. He was critical of the Labour Party, which was founded in 1900, for what he perceived as its complete subservience to Liberalism, especially in its Cobdenite internationalist views on foreign policy. Blatchford said of himself and his colleagues at &quot;The Clarion&quot;: &quot;We were out for Socialism and nothing but Socialism, and we were Britons first and Socialists next.&quot;

Blatchford criticised free trade from an economic nationalist perspective. Free trade had made it impossible for Britain to feed herself and had destroyed British agriculture. This was especially serious in wartime because Britain could be starved into submission due to the dependence for her food on foreign nations. When Joseph Chamberlain launched his crusade for Tariff Reform in 1903, Blatchford&#x27;s response was ambiguous. He did not formally endorse Chamberlain&#x27;s campaign, but &quot;The Clarion&quot; praised his aims—the revival of British agriculture, a self-sufficient Empire, and producer-focused instead of consumer-focused economic system. Blatchford said he did not believe in tariff reform as applied by Conservatives, but that a socialist government would find it a necessary instrument.
A further development in Blatchford&#x27;s thinking cost him further readers, when he began denouncing organised religion in such works as &quot;God and My Neighbour&quot; (1903) and &quot;Not Guilty: A Defence of the Bottom Dog&quot; (1905). Again, to antagonise the ILP, the &quot;Clarion&quot; raised funds for Victor Grayson, whom the ILP had declined to support. He justified his attacks as being because Labour was too close to the Liberals.

==&quot;Merrie England&quot;==

A series of articles on socialism in &quot;The Clarion&quot; were published in book form in 1893 as &quot;Merrie England&quot;. The first edition sold 30,000 copies. The year after, a pocket-sized edition was published, which sold 25,000 copies. A penny edition was published in 1894, with 250,000 copies being ordered before publication and within a year 750,000 copies had been despatched across the English speaking world. In Britain and America, the book sold over two million copies. In the opinion of Robert Ensor, the book &quot;helped to make socialism really well known in England for the first time...It was Blatchford&#x27;s highest flight as a propagandist; he never surpassed it, and through it mainly he left his mark upon history&quot;. The book was translated into Welsh, Hebrew, Dutch, Italian, Spanish and German.

William Thomas Stead picked the book as the &quot;Review of Reviews&quot; book of the month and called Blatchford &quot;the poor man&#x27;s Plato&quot;. Dr Horton the Congregationalist minister compared Blatchford to Isaiah, Amos and Micah and said that &quot;if Jesus Christ were a man on earth today, He would read the book not only with interest but with approval, and He would say to any officious disciples who took exception to parts of it, “Forbid him not; he that is not against Me is for Me&quot;.&quot; C. P. Scott of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote to Blatchford, saying: &quot;I have been reading &quot;Merrie England&quot; and (&quot;pace&quot; the reviewers) find a great deal in it!&quot; The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; said that for every British convert to socialism made by &quot;Das Kapital&quot; there were a hundred made by &quot;Merrie England&quot;.

At the Oxford Union a motion was approved by 103 to 54 that stated that &quot;the aims of the Socialist tract, &quot;Merrie England&quot;, are but the baseless fabric of a vision&quot;. The motion was seconded by Hilaire Belloc.

Blatchford was a vegetarian and in &quot;Merrie England&quot; he mentioned the economic, health and humanitarian benefits of a vegetarian diet.

==War scare of 1909==
At the end of the second week of December 1909, Blatchford wrote ten daily articles for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; warning of the German menace:

I write these articles because I believe that Germany is deliberately preparing to destroy the British Empire; and because I know that we are not ready or able to defend ourselves against a sudden and formidable attack...At the present moment the whole country is in a ferment about the Budget and the Peers and the Election. It seems sheer criminal lunacy to waste time and strength in chasing such political bubble when the existence of the Empire is threatened.

The articles received considerable attention in Britain and Germany, and when published as a pamphlet sold over one and a half million copies. The King &quot;lamented Blatchford&#x27;s violence&quot; and the Kaiser read Blatchford&#x27;s articles with care and denounced them as &quot;very mischievous and singularly ill-timed&quot;. Sir Charles Ottley, the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, wrote to Lord Esher that Blatchford&#x27;s appeal was not based on a partisan, political basis as he had said that the country did not want a Liberal or Unionist government but a MAN: &quot;His strength is that he knows what he wants and is not afraid to ask for it in plain language...The burthen of the song is—compulsory service, a strong navy and a general raising of the standard of education and living of the masses of the British people&quot;. Lord Cromer publicly declared that he shared Blatchford&#x27;s patriotism. The articles ensured that defence was a major issue in the ensuing general election of January 1910. After the election the Liberal MP Reginald McKenna boasted that Blatchford had not cost the Liberals a single vote. Keir Hardie said that &quot;the whole Socialist movement was rocking with suppressed laughter&quot;.

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot;′s Berlin correspondent told Lord Northcliffe: &quot;In a long experience...I do not recall a foreign journalistic event which so focused the attention of the German press and public&quot;. There was universal condemnation in German newspapers, including Social Democratic, Catholic and Pan-German organs. When the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg complained to Edward Goschen, the British ambassador in Berlin, the Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey advised Goschen to explain the articles as &quot;not really anti-German but alarmist...to create a scare&quot;.

Shortly before the general election of December 1910, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published Blatchford&#x27;s series of articles on ‘The Greatest Issue of All’, the German threat. However these were nowhere near as influential as his previous ones and defence was not an issue in the election.

In 1909 he began advocating conscription but in 1912 troops were used for strike breaking and Blatchford turned against it: &quot;Universal military service under the (present) ruling classes would result in slavery. I regard invasion as the lesser evil&quot;. However, he supported conscription again in 1915 and proclaimed it should be implemented along with the &quot;conscription of wealth&quot;. Before the war, Blatchford toured Germany and after he returned to England he wrote:

I am convinced that...they will be plunged into war without their will. I like Germany; I like German cities; and I like the German people. But I believe that the rulers of the German people are deliberately and cynically preparing to hurl them into a wicked and a desperate war of conquest...The Germans cannot prevent that war, because they do not believe it is coming. The British could prevent that war if, before it is too late, they could be really convinced that it is coming. That is why I want to convince them that war is coming, because I want to prevent that horrible war.

Blatchford was impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency in Germany: &quot;You don&#x27;t see anything like that in Germany. I thought to myself, is this how we are preparing to fight for the existence of our Empire? What use will these ragged, famished spectres be when we have our backs to the wall?&quot;

==Later life==
On 4 August 1914, Blatchford wrote to his friend Alexander Thompson: &quot;I shall write today a cautious article counselling peace and suggesting that Sir E. Grey should ask Russia and Germany to suspend hostilities pending a friendly mediation by America, England and Italy, or any one of those powers. But I do not think really that European peace is possible until Germany has been defeated and humiliated. And I realise the great possibility that we shall be at war with Germany before the &quot;Clarion&quot; comes out. And I hope we are&quot;. The Clarion Movement was split when Blatchford swung his paper in support of the British participation in the First World War. The circulation for &quot;The Clarion&quot; fell by 10,000 in a week but when in September 1914 Blatchford wrote a page of &quot;The Weekly Dispatch&quot; every Sunday its circulation rose by 50,000. In his first article for that paper, Blatchford correctly predicted that the German Army would not reach Paris and of General Joffre&#x27;s flank along the Marne.

Blatchford visited France in October 1914 and was shocked by the conduct of the Germans in waging war. Initially warning his readers of fake atrocity stories, Blatchford was shocked by the ruined villages in France and the stories he heard, &quot;too horrible and too unclean to be revealed in print&quot;. He wrote to Thompson in 1933: &quot;In the early days of the war the movement howled with indignation about the lying charges brought against the German General Staff and troops. The noble Germans were incapable of such crimes. British and Belgian and American witnesses were all liars. Today the same intelligent comrades are denouncing the atrocities committed by the Nazi &#x27;storm troops&#x27; upon innocent and helpless Jews. Well, old pal, may I suggest that if the Germans of today are guilty perhaps the Huns of 1914 were not quite innocent&quot;.

In his articles during the war, Blatchford campaigned for better pay for the soldiers and considerable pensions for disabled soldiers, soldiers&#x27; widows and children. When a soldier wrote to him, claiming his opinions would not be accepted by the Army but those of Philip Snowden and Ramsay MacDonald would, Blatchford replied: &quot;I am sorry. I cannot help it. You want peace. But you cannot have peace without victory...The struggle with Germany will not end with the present war, and we may some day have to fight Germany single-handed&quot;.

In 1915, Blatchford formed the National Democratic and Labour Party (NDP) as a splinter from the right wing of the British Socialist Party and for the 1918 General Election, the NDP stood in eighteen constituencies and returned nine Members of Parliament with 156,834 votes. It thereby became the first party formed by a right-wing split from the Labour Party in Britain to win seats in Parliament at a general election.

Blatchford&#x27;s wife died in 1921, and later he took an interest in Spiritualism. In 1923 he wrote in response to claims in the press that he had been converted away from socialism by reading Henry Ford&#x27;s autobiography:

I have never been converted from Socialism. But careful observation of the facts of for the last twelve years or so has convinced me that Socialism will not work, and a study of Mr. Ford&#x27;s methods has provided what seems to me as good a substitute as we may hope in this imperfect world. Socialism as I knew it in past years was an excellent, almost a perfect, theory...The golden rule will not work in international politics, because the nations are not good enough to live up to it. Real Socialism strongly resembles real Christianity. It is a counsel of perfection and cannot be adopted and adhered to by our imperfect humanity. There is nothing the matter with Socialism, but the people are neither wise enough nor good enough to make it a success. Socialism implies the self-abnegation of the individual for the good of the community.

When the first Labour government, led by Ramsay MacDonald, took office in 1924, Blatchford responded to Thompson&#x27;s enthusiasm: &quot;I don&#x27;t like their policy and I don&#x27;t trust them. They are in no sense Socialists. At present they are Liberals and we shall have a blend of Liberal Shibboleths and communist insanity&quot;. When Sir Edward Hulton sold most of his newspapers to Lord Rothermere, Blatchford wrote a letter to &quot;The Morning Post&quot;:

As a protest against the attempt of the syndicated newspapers to muzzle the press and dictate to the Government, I have resigned my position on &quot;The Sunday Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot;...the public should be helped to realise that the political judgments of the syndicated newspapers are not sincere and considered opinions of trained, independent thinkers, but the broadcast railings of one rich man in a panic over the Capital Levy. It is important that this should be said, and that the country should understand that the voice of Lord Rothermere is not the voice of public opinion. His standardised newspapers are journalistic tied houses, where proprietorial dope is sold as honest beer.

Blatchford voted Conservative in 1924. However, his later books indicate a continued faith in his own English version of socialism. Moreover, the Clarion Movement carried on as a socialist popular movement, taking its cue from Blatchford, into the 1930s and beyond, as indicated by the continued existence of the Clarion rambling and cycling clubs and the founding of the newspaper &quot;The New Clarion&quot; in 1932. In a 1931 letter to Alexander Thompson, Blatchford proclaimed his last political credo, his language remaining fiery and eloquent:

I have always been a Tory Democrat...You remember that from the first the Clarion crowd and the Hardie crowd were out of harmony ... I loathe the &quot;top-hatted, frock-coated magnolia-scented&quot; snobocracy as much as you do; but I cannot away with the Keir Hardies and Arthur Hendersons and Ramsay MacDonalds and Bernard Shaws and Maxtons. Not long ago you told me in a letter of some trade union delegates who were smoking cigars and drinking whisky at the House of Commons at the expense of their unions. You liked them not. Nor do I like the Trade Union bigots who have cheated J. H. Thomas of his pension...I am glad the Labour Party is defeated because I believe they would have disrupted the British Empire. I dreaded their childish cosmopolitanism; their foolish faith that we could abolish crime by reducing the police force. All the other nations are out for their own ends. American enthusiasm for Naval Disarmament is not dictated by a love of peace. It is an expression of naval rivalry. All the nations hated our naval supremacy. Do the Americans love us? Do the French love us? Is France, America, Italy, devoted to an unselfish and human peace? Can we dispel the bellicose sentiments of Russia and China and Japan by sending an old pantaloon to talk platitudes at Geneva, or by disbanding the Horse Guards and scrapping a few submarines?...The England of my affection and devotion is not a country nor a people: it is a tradition, the finest tradition the world has ever produced. The Labour Party do not subscribe to that tradition; do not know it; could not feel it. And if that tradition is to survive, the policy of scuttle and surrender must be abandoned. You agree with all this I feel sure. You always upheld the Pax Britannica. We have not drifted apart, old pal: our separation is only geographical.

After Adolf Hitler became German Chancellor in 1933, Blatchford &quot;began to smell brimstone&quot;, in the words of his biographer Laurence Thompson. Blatchford said: &quot;The people ought to know; but who will let me say what ought to be said?&quot; Blatchford feared that people would say: &quot;Oh, &quot;Blatchford&quot;. He has Germany on the brain.&quot; When Winston Churchill began warning of the dangers of Nazi Germany, Blatchford remarked: &quot;Ha! He&#x27;s learning! Now watch &quot;him&quot; get it in the neck&quot;. Later on, Blatchford believed Churchill&#x27;s conduct redeemed what he considered his past political errors.

On 17 December 1943, Blatchford died in Horsham, Sussex at the age of 92.

==Legacy==
Blatchford&#x27;s &quot;love of country&quot; themes were not a late aberration but can be found throughout his output. His combination of libertarianism, socialism and conservatism mark him out as one of the more original activists in English political history. The first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, said of Blatchford in his autobiography:

In these years Mr. Blatchford gave invaluable help to Socialist propaganda. No man did more than he to make Socialism understood by the ordinary working man. His writings in them had nothing of economic abstruseness. He based his appeal on the principles of human justice. He preached Socialism as a system of industrial co-operation for the common good. His arguments and illustrations were drawn from facts and experiences within the knowledge of the common people. Socialism as he taught it was not a cold, materialistic theory, but the promise of a new life as full, sweet and noble as the world can give...Mr. Blatchford is still living, hale and hearty, his mental powers undiminished aged 83. I saw him recently, and we talked of those grand and inspiring times of forty years ago. Only the men who were in the Socialist movement in those days can know the great part Robert Blatchford took in making it popular, and of the personal devotion he inspired by his writings.

The General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress from 1925 to 1946, Sir Walter Citrine, was influenced by Blatchford&#x27;s writings. He said of &quot;Britain for the British&quot;: &quot;I found it a cogent and reasoned argument for Socialism. It was written with a clearness and bite which were unusual&quot;. Clement Attlee also spoke of Blatchford&#x27;s influence on his beliefs. A. J. P. Taylor said that Blatchford was &quot;the greatest popular journalist since Cobbett&quot;.

<text>Edward Carpenter (29 August 1844 – 28 June 1929) was an English utopian socialist, poet, philosopher, anthologist, an early activist for gay rights and prison reform whilst advocating vegetarianism and taking a stance against vivisection. As a philosopher, he was particularly known for his publication of &quot;Civilisation: Its Cause and Cure&quot;. Here, he described civilisation as a form of disease through which human societies pass.

An early advocate of sexual liberation, he had an influence on both D. H. Lawrence and Sri Aurobindo, and inspired E. M. Forster&#x27;s novel &quot;Maurice&quot;.

==Early life==
Born at 45 Brunswick Square, Hove in Sussex, Carpenter was educated at nearby Brighton College, where his father Charles Carpenter was a governor. His brothers Charles, George and Alfred also went to school there. Edward&#x27;s grandfather was Vice-Admiral James Carpenter (d 1845). When he was ten, Carpenter displayed a flair for the piano.

His academic ability became evident relatively late in his youth, but was sufficient to earn him a place at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. At Trinity Hall, Carpenter came under the influence of Christian Socialist theologian F. D. Maurice. Whilst there he also began to explore his feelings for men. One of the most notable examples of this is his close friendship with Edward Anthony Beck (later Master of Trinity Hall), which, according to Carpenter, had &quot;a touch of romance&quot;. Beck eventually ended their friendship, causing Carpenter great emotional heartache. Carpenter graduated as 10th Wrangler in 1868. After university, he was ordained as curate of the Church of England, &quot;as a convention rather than out of deep Conviction&quot;, and served as curate to Maurice at the parish of St Edward&#x27;s, Cambridge.

In 1871 Carpenter was invited to become tutor to the royal princes George Frederick (later King George V) and his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, but declined the position. His lifelong friend and fellow Cambridge student John Neale Dalton took the position. Carpenter continued to visit Dalton while he was tutor. They were given photographs of the pair, taken by the princes.

In the following years he experienced an increasing sense of dissatisfaction with his life in the church and university, and became weary of what he saw as the hypocrisy of Victorian society. He found great solace in reading poetry, later remarking that his discovery of the work of Walt Whitman caused &quot;a profound change&quot; in him. Five or six years later he visited Whitman in Camden, New Jersey, in 1877.

==Move to the North of England==
Carpenter was voluntarily released from the Anglican ministry and left the church in 1874 and moved to Leeds, becoming a lecturer as part of University Extension Movement, which was formed by academics who wished to widen access to education in deprived communities. He lectured in astronomy, the lives of ancient Greek women and music and had hoped to lecture to the working classes, but found his lectures were mostly attended by middle class people, many of whom showed little active interest in the subjects he taught. Disillusioned, he moved to Chesterfield, but finding that town dull, moved to nearby Sheffield a year later. Here he came into contact with manual workers, and he began to write poetry. His sexual preferences were for working men: &quot;the grimy and oil-besmeared figure of a stoker&quot; or &quot;the thick-thighed hot coarse-fleshed young bricklayer with a strap around his waist&quot;.

When his father Charles Carpenter died in 1882, Edward inherited the sum of £6,000 (). This enabled Carpenter to quit his lectureship to seek the simpler life, first on a small holding at Totley near Sheffield with Albert Ferneyhough, a scythe-maker, and his family in 1880; Albert and Edward became lovers and in 1883 moved to Millthorpe, Derbyshire together with Albert&#x27;s family, where Carpenter built a large new house with outbuildings in 1883 constructed of local gritstone with a slate roof, in the style of the seventeenth century. There they had a small market garden and made and sold leather sandals, based on the design of sandals sent to him from India by Harold Cox on Carpenter&#x27;s request.

Carpenter popularised the phrase the &quot;Simple Life&quot; in his essay &quot;Simplification of Life&quot; in his &quot;England&#x27;s Ideal&quot; (1887). Sheffield architect Raymond Unwin was a frequent visitor to Millthorpe and the simple revival of vernacular English architecture at Millthorpe and Carpenter&#x27;s &#x27;simple life&#x27; there were powerful influences on Unwin&#x27;s later Garden City architecture and ideals, suggesting as they did a coherent but radical new lifestyle.

In Sheffield, Carpenter became increasingly radical. Influenced by a disciple of Engels, Henry Hyndman, he joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in 1883 and attempted to form a branch in the city. The group instead chose to remain independent, and became the Sheffield Socialist Society. While in the city he worked on a number of projects including highlighting the poor living conditions of industrial workers. In 1884, he left the SDF with William Morris to join the Socialist League. From there he stayed with William Harrison Riley while he was visiting Walt Whitman.

In 1883, Carpenter published the first part of &quot;Towards Democracy&quot;, a long poem expressing Carpenter&#x27;s ideas about &quot;spiritual democracy&quot; and how Carpenter believed humanity could move towards a freer and more just society. &quot;Towards Democracy&quot; was heavily influenced by Whitman&#x27;s poetry, as well as the Hindu scripture, the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. Expanded editions of &quot;Towards Democracy&quot; appeared in 1885, 1892, and 1902; the complete edition of &quot;Towards Democracy&quot; was published in 1905.

In 1886–87 Carpenter was in a relationship with George Hukin, a razor grinder. Carpenter lived with Cecil Reddie from 1888 to 1889 and in 1889 helped Reddie found Abbotsholme School in Derbyshire as a notably progressive alternative to the traditional public school, with the financial support of Robert Muirhead and William Cassels.

In May 1889, Carpenter wrote a piece in the &quot;Sheffield Independent&quot; calling Sheffield the laughing-stock of the civilized world and said that the giant thick cloud of smog rising out of Sheffield was like the smoke arising from Judgment Day, and that it was the altar on which the lives of many thousands would be sacrificed. He said that 100,000 adults and children were struggling to find sunlight and air, enduring miserable lives, unable to breathe and dying of related illnesses.

==Travel in India==
Drawn increasingly to Hindu philosophy, he travelled to India and Ceylon in 1890. Following conversations with the guru Ramaswamy (known as the Gnani) there, he developed the conviction that socialism would bring about a revolution in human consciousness as well as of economic conditions. His account of the travel was published in 1892 as &quot;From Adam&#x27;s Peak to Elephanta: Sketches in Ceylon and India&quot;. The book&#x27;s spiritual explorations would subsequently influence the Russian author Peter Ouspensky, who discusses it extensively in his own book, &quot;Tertium Organum&quot; (1912).

==Life with George Merrill==

On his return from India in 1891, he met George Merrill, a working-class man also from Sheffield, 22 years his junior, and after the Ferneyhoughs left Millthorpe in 1893 Merrill became Carpenter&#x27;s companion. The two remained partners for the rest of their lives, cohabiting from 1898. Merrill, the son of an engine driver, had been raised in the slums of Sheffield and had little formal education.

Carpenter remarked in his work &quot;The Intermediate Sex&quot;:

Eros is a great leveller. Perhaps the true Democracy rests, more firmly than anywhere else, on a sentiment which easily passes the bounds of class and caste, and unites in the closest affection the most estranged ranks of society. It is noticeable how often Uranians of good position and breeding are drawn to rougher types, as of manual workers, and frequently very permanent alliances grow up in this way, which although not publicly acknowledged have a decided influence on social institutions, customs and political tendencies.

Carpenter included among his friends the scholar, author, naturalist, and founder of the Humanitarian League, Henry S. Salt, and his wife, Catherine; the critic, essayist and sexologist, Havelock Ellis, and his wife, Edith; actor and producer Ben Iden Payne; Labour activists Bruce and Katharine Glasier; writer and scholar, John Addington Symonds; and the feminist writer, Olive Schreiner.

E. M. Forster was a close friend and visited the couple regularly. He later recounted that it was a visit to Millthorpe in 1913 that inspired him to write his gay-themed novel, &quot;Maurice&quot;. Forster wrote in his terminal note to the aforementioned novel that Merrill &quot;touched my backside – gently and just above the buttocks. I believe he touched most people&#x27;s. The sensation was unusual and I still remember it, as I remember the position of a long vanished tooth. He made a profound impression on me and touched a creative spring.&quot;

The relationship between Carpenter and Merrill was an inspiration for the relationship between Maurice Hall and Alec Scudder, the gamekeeper in &quot;Maurice&quot;. The author D. H. Lawrence read the manuscript of &quot;Maurice&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1971. Carpenter&#x27;s rural lifestyle and the manuscript influenced Lawrence&#x27;s 1928 novel &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; which, though built around a central relationship between a man and a woman, involves a gamekeeper and a member of the upper-class.

==Later life==

In 1902 Carpenter&#x27;s anthology of verse and prose, &quot;Ioläus: An Anthology of Friendship&quot;, was published. The book was published again in 1906 by William Swan Sonnenschein.

In 1915, he published &quot;The Healing of Nations and the Hidden Sources of Their Strife&quot;, where he argued that the source of war and discontent in western society was class-monopoly and social inequality.

Carpenter became an advocate of the Christ myth theory. His book &quot;Pagan and Christian Creeds&quot; was published by Harcourt, Brace and Howe in 1921.

The death of George Hukin in 1917 at the age of 56 seems to have broken Carpenter&#x27;s attachment to the North of England. In 1922 he and Merrill moved to Guildford, Surrey and the two lived at 23 Mountside Rd. On Carpenter&#x27;s 80th birthday he was presented an album signed by every member of the then Labour Government, headed by Ramsay MacDonald, Prime Minister, who Carpenter had known since his teenage years.

In January 1928, Merrill died suddenly, having become dependent on alcohol since moving to Surrey. His death devastated Carpenter; he sold their joint home and moved in with his carer Ted Inigan. In May 1928, Carpenter suffered a paralytic stroke. He lived another 13 months before he died on 28 June 1929, aged 84. He was interred in the same grave as Merrill at the Mount Cemetery in Guildford under a lengthy invocation written by Carpenter.

His obituary in The Times was headed &quot;Edward Carpenter, Author and Poet&quot;, though the text did also refer to his political campaigns.

==Influence==
Carpenter corresponded with many leading figures in political and cultural circles, among them Annie Besant, Isadora Duncan, Havelock Ellis, Roger Fry, Mahatma Gandhi, Keir Hardie, Jack London, George Merrill, E. D. Morel, William Morris, Edward R. Pease, John Ruskin, and Olive Schreiner.

Carpenter was a friend of Rabindranath Tagore, and of Walt Whitman. Aldous Huxley recommended Carpenter&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Civilization: Its Cause and Cure&quot; in his book &quot;Science, Liberty and Peace&quot;. Modernist art critic Herbert Read credited Carpenter&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Non-Governmental Society&quot; with converting him to anarchism.

Leslie Paul was influenced by Carpenter&#x27;s work; in turn he passed on Carpenter&#x27;s ideas to the scouting group he founded, The Woodcraft Folk. Algernon Blackwood was another devotee of Carpenter&#x27;s work; Blackwood corresponded with Carpenter and included a quotation from &quot;Civilization: Its Cause and Cure&quot; in his 1911 novel &quot;The Centaur&quot;.

Fenner Brockway, in a 1929 obituary of Carpenter, acknowledged him as an influence on Brockway and his associates when young. Brockway described Carpenter as &quot;the greatest spiritual inspiration of our lives. &quot;Towards Democracy&quot; was our Bible.&quot; Ansel Adams was an admirer of Carpenter&#x27;s writings, especially &quot;Towards Democracy&quot;. Emma Goldman cited Carpenter&#x27;s books as an influence on her thought, and stated that Carpenter possessed &quot;the wisdom of the sage.&quot; Countee Cullen said that reading Carpenter&#x27;s book &quot;Iolaus&quot; &quot;opened up for me soul windows which had been closed&quot;.

Carpenter was sometimes called &quot;the English Tolstoy&quot; and Tolstoy himself considered him &quot;a worthy heir of Carlyle and Ruskin&quot;.

==Revival of reputation==
Following his death, Carpenter&#x27;s written works fell out of print and were largely forgotten except among devotees of British labour movement history. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, interest in his work was revived by historians such as Jeffrey Weeks and Sheila Rowbotham, and some of Carpenter&#x27;s works were reprinted by the Gay Men&#x27;s Press. Carpenter&#x27;s opposition to pollution and cruelty to animals have resulted in some historians arguing Carpenter&#x27;s ideas anticipated the modern Green and animal rights movements. Carpenter was described by Fiona MacCarthy as the &quot;Saint in Sandals&quot;, the &quot;Noble Savage&quot; and, more recently, the &quot;gay godfather of the British left&quot;.

==Written works==
&quot;Chants of Labour&quot; was a songbook for socialists, contributions to which Carpenter had solicited in &quot;The Commonweal&quot;.
It comprised works by John Glasse, Edith Nesbit, John Bruce Glasier, Andreas Scheu, William Morris, Jim Connell, Herbert Burrows, and others.

<text>Alfred Richard Orage (22 January 1873 – 6 November 1934) was a British influential figure in socialist politics and modernist culture, now best known for editing the magazine &quot;The New Age&quot; before the First World War. While he was working as a schoolteacher in Leeds he pursued various interests, including Plato, the Independent Labour Party and theosophy. In 1900, he met Holbrook Jackson and three years later they co-founded the Leeds Arts Club, which became a centre of modernist culture in Britain. After 1924, Orage went to France to work with George Gurdjieff and was then sent to the United States by Gurdjieff to raise funds and lecture. He translated several of Gurdjieff&#x27;s works.

==Early life and education==
James Alfred Orage was born in Dacre, near Harrogate in the West Riding of Yorkshire, son of Nonconformist parents William Orage and Sarah Anne () who was &quot;believed to have been of Irish descent&quot;. After marrying Sarah, &quot;a fatherless girl, living with her mother&quot;, William Orage had &quot;fecklessly drank&quot; and gambled away his inheritance, a &quot;little farm in Cambridgeshire&quot; near his home village of Fenstanton, Huntingdonshire. A move to Dacre, where he &quot;took up schoolmastering&quot;, had failed to improve his fortunes. Alfred had one sister. He was generally known as Dickie and he eventually dropped the name James and adopted the middle name Alfred as his first name, and Richard as his second. His father died when he was one year old and his mother, who had little financial means (particularly owing to the collapse of the firm of lawyers responsible for the annuity of £50 William had left the family), returned to the Orage family&#x27;s home village of Fenstanton. They were &quot;decently, grindingly poor&quot;; Sarah took in laundry to make ends meet and Alfred had to work as a farm labourer from the age of ten. Fortunately, Howard Coote, son of the local squire, went to see his father and the local schoolmaster, all of them agreeing it &quot;a thousand pities to try to make a ploughboy of Alfred&quot;. Accordingly, Coote paid Sarah a &quot;peppercorn allowance&quot; that kept Alfred at school. Alfred excelled in his studies, and was sent to Culham training college in Oxfordshire where he also taught himself editorial skills and obtained a teaching post in Leeds, returning to Yorkshire in autumn 1893.

== Leeds: socialism, theosophy and the Leeds Arts Club ==
In 1894, Orage became a schoolteacher at an elementary school in Leeds and helped to found the Leeds branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He wrote a weekly literary column for the ILP&#x27;s paper, the &quot;Labour Leader&quot;, from 1895 to 1897. He brought a philosophical outlook to the paper, including in particular the thought of Plato and the theosophist Edward Carpenter, who was Orage&#x27;s mentor for a time. Orage devoted seven years of study to Plato, from 1893 to 1900. He set up a philosophical discussion circle called the Plato Group, including the architect Thomas Butler Wilson who was a friend of Alfred&#x27;s future wife, Jean.

By the late 1890s, Orage was disillusioned with conventional socialism and turned for a while to theosophy. In 1896, Orage married Jean Walker, an art student at the Royal College of Art who was a passionate member of the Theosophical Society. The couple frequented the Northern Federation headquarters in Harrogate where Orage first met Annie Besant and other leading theosophists and began to lecture on mysticism, occultism, and idealism in Manchester and Leeds as well as publishing material in the &quot;Theosophical Review&quot;. Orage was influenced by Edward Carpenter&#x27;s belief that women were behind the new force that would bring change to society. Alfred and Jean opened a theosophist branch in Leeds called the Alpha Centre, even though a regular lodge already existed in the city, and Jean represented it in Harrogate until 1900 when the Leeds lodge was re-founded by the Orages as well as Jean&#x27;s cousin, A. K. Kennedy. Jean lectured at the Northern Federation Conference in 1904. Jean also helped Alfred with the council meetings of the Leeds lodge. Jean was an excellent needlewoman and sharp debater; she finally left Alfred to pursue her textile career in Haslemere and later working on the looms for William Morris&#x27;s firm in Oxford Street, London.

In 1900, he met Holbrook Jackson in a Leeds bookshop and lent him a copy of the Bhagavad-Gita. In return, Jackson lent him Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, which led Orage to study Nietzsche&#x27;s work in depth. Orage devoted seven years of his life to the study of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy, from 1900 to 1907, and, from 1907 to 1914, he was a student of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

In 1903, Orage, Jackson, and the architect Arthur J. Penty helped to found the Leeds Arts Club with the intention of promoting the work of radical thinkers including George Bernard Shaw, whom Orage had met in 1898, Henrik Ibsen, and Nietzsche. During this period, Orage returned to socialist platforms, but by 1906, he was determined to combine Carpenter&#x27;s socialism with Nietzsche&#x27;s thought and theosophy.

In 1906, Beatrice Hastings became a regular contributor to the &quot;New Age&quot;. By 1907, she and Orage had developed an intimate relationship. As Hastings herself later put it, &quot;Aphrodite amused herself at our expense&quot;. Orage appears to have had a magnetic effect on many women who frequented his lectures; both Mary Gawthorpe and Millie Price have left accounts of their sexual relationships with him.

Orage explored his new ideas in several books. He saw Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Übermensch&quot; as a metaphor for the &quot;higher state of consciousness&quot; sought by mystics and attempted to define a route to this higher state, insisting that it must involve a rejection of civilisation and conventional morality. He moved through a celebration of Dionysus to declare that he was in favour, not of an ordered socialism, but of an anarchic movement.

Between 1906 and 1907, Orage published three books: &quot;Consciousness: Animal, Human and Superhuman&quot;, based on his experience with theosophy; &quot;Friedrich Nietzsche: The Dionysian Spirit of the Age&quot;; and &quot;Nietzsche in Outline and Aphorism&quot;. Orage&#x27;s rational critique of theosophy evoked an editorial rebuttal from &quot;The Theosophical Review&quot; and, in 1907, he terminated his association with the Theosophical Society. The two books on Nietzsche were the first systematic introductions to Nietzschean thought to be published in Britain.

==Editor in London==
In 1906, Orage resigned his teaching post and moved to London, following Penty there. In London, Orage attempted to form a league for the restoration of the guild system, in the spirit of the decentralised socialism of William Morris. The failure of this project spurred him to buy the weekly magazine &quot;The New Age&quot; in 1907, in partnership with Holbrook Jackson and with the support of Shaw. Orage transformed the magazine to fit with his conception of a forum for politics, literature, and the arts. Although many contributors were Fabians, he distanced himself from their politics to some extent and sought to have the magazine represent a wide range of political views. He used the magazine to launch attacks on parliamentary politics and argued the need for utopianism. He also attacked trade union leadership, while offering some support to syndicalism, and tried to combine syndicalism with his ideal of a revived guild system. Combining these two ideas resulted in guild socialism, the political philosophy Orage began to argue for from about 1910, though the specific term &quot;guild socialism&quot; seems not to have been mentioned in print until Bertrand Russell referred to it in his book &quot;Political Ideals&quot; (1917).

Between 1908 and 1914, &quot;The New Age&quot; was the premier little magazine in Britain. It was instrumental in pioneering the British avant-garde, from vorticism to imagism, and its contributors included T.E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, Katherine Mansfield, Ezra Pound and Herbert Read. Orage&#x27;s success as an editor was connected with his talent as a conversationalist and a &quot;bringer together&quot; of people. The modernists of London had been scattered between 1905 and 1910, but, largely thanks to Orage, a sense of a modernist &quot;movement&quot; was created from 1910 onwards.

==Politics==
Orage declared himself a socialist and followed Georges Sorel in arguing that trade unions should pursue an increasingly aggressive policy on wage deals and working conditions. He approved of the increasing militancy of the unions in the era before the First World War and seems to have shared Sorel&#x27;s belief in the necessity of a union-led general strike leading to a revolutionary situation. For Orage, economic power precedes political power, and political reform is useless without economic reform.

In the early issues of &quot;The New Age&quot;, Orage supported the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, but he became increasingly hostile to it as the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union became more prominent and more militant. Pro-suffragette articles were not published after 1910, but heated debate on the subject took place in the correspondence columns.

During the First World War, Orage defended what he saw as the interests of the working class. On 6 August 1914, he wrote in &quot;Notes of the Week&quot; in &quot;The New Age&quot;: &quot;We believe that England is necessary to Socialism, as Socialism is necessary to the world.&quot; On 14 November 1918, Orage wrote of the coming peace settlement, embodied in the Treaty of Versailles: &quot;The next world war, if unhappily there should be another, will in all probability be contained within the clauses and conditions attaching to the present peace settlement.&quot;

By then, Orage was convinced that the hardships of the working class were the result of the monetary policies of banks and governments. If Britain could remove the pound from the gold standard during the War and re-establish the gold standard after, the gold standard was not as necessary as the monetary oligarchs wanted the proletariat to believe that it was. On 15 July 1920, Orage wrote: &quot;We should be the first to admit that the subject of Money is difficult to understand. It is &#x27;intended&#x27; to be, by the minute oligarchy that governs the world by means of it.&quot;

After the War, Orage was influenced by C. H. Douglas and became a supporter of the social credit movement. On 2 January 1919, Orage published the first article by Douglas to appear in &quot;The New Age&quot;, &quot;A Mechanical View of Economics&quot;.

==With Gurdjieff==
Orage had met P. D. Ouspensky for the first time in 1914. Ouspensky&#x27;s ideas had left a lasting impression and, when Ouspensky moved to London in 1921, Orage began attending his lectures on &quot;Fragments of an Unknown Teaching&quot;, the basis of his book &quot;In Search of the Miraculous&quot;. From this time onwards Orage became less and less interested in literature and art, and instead focused most of his attention on mysticism. His correspondence with Harry Houdini on this subject moved him to explore ideas of the afterlife. He returned to the idea that there are absolute truths and concluded that they are embodied in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

In February 1922, Ouspensky introduced Orage to G. I. Gurdjieff. Orage sold &quot;The New Age&quot; and moved to Paris to study at the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man. In 1924, Gurdjieff appointed him to lead study groups in the United States, which he did for seven years. Soon after Gurdjieff arrived in New York from France on 13 November 1930, he deposed Orage and disbanded his study groups, believing that Orage had been teaching them incorrectly; they had been working under the misconception that self-observation could be practised in the absence of self-remembering or in the presence of negative emotions. Members were allowed to continue their studies with Gurdjieff himself, after taking an oath not to communicate with Orage. Upon hearing that Orage had also signed the oath, Gurdjieff wept. Gurdjieff had once considered Orage as a friend and brother, and thought of Jessie as a bad choice for a mate. Orage was a chain smoker and Jessie was a heavy drinker. In the privately published third series of his writings, Gurdjieff wrote of Orage and his wife Jessie: &quot;his romance had ended in his marrying the saleswoman of &#x27;Sunwise Turn,&#x27; a young American pampered out of all proportion to her position…&quot;

Orage, Ouspensky, and King emphasised certain aspects of the Gurdjieff System while ignoring others. According to Gurdjieff, Orage emphasised self-observation. In Harlem, Jean Toomer, one of Orage&#x27;s students at Greenwich Village, used Gurdjieff&#x27;s work to confront the problem of racism.

In 1927, Orage&#x27;s first wife, Jean, granted him a divorce and in September he married Jessie Richards Dwight (1901–1985), the co-owner of The Sunwise Turn bookshop where Orage first lectured on the Gurdjieff System. Orage and Jessie had two children, Richard and Ann. While they were in New York, Orage and his wife often catered to celebrities such as Paul Robeson, fresh from his London tour. In 1930, Orage returned to England and, in 1931, he began publishing the &quot;New English Weekly&quot;. He remained in London until his death on 6 November 1934.

The Orages sailed back to New York from England on the S.S. &quot;Washington&quot; on 29 December 1930, and arrived on 8 January 1931. The next day, while they were staying at the Irving Hotel, Orage wrote a letter to Gurdjieff unveiling a plan for the publication of &quot;All and Everything&quot; before the end of the year and promising a substantial amount of money. At lunch in New York City on 21 February 1931, Achmed Abdulla, a.k.a. Nadir Kahn, told the Orages that he had met Gurdjieff in Tibet and that Gurdjieff had been known there as &quot;Lama Dordjieff&quot;, a Tsarist agent and tutor to the Dalai Lama. Orage also helped Gurdjieff to translate &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot; from Russian to English, but it was not published in their lifetimes.

==Last years==

In London, Orage became involved in politics again through the social credit movement. He returned to New York on 8 January 1931 in an attempt to meet Gurdjieff&#x27;s new demands, but he told his wife that he would not be teaching the Gurdjieff System to any group past the end of the spring. Orage was on the pier on 13 March 1931 to bid Gurdjieff farewell on his way back to France and the Orages sailed back to England on 3 July.

In April 1932, Orage founded a new journal, &quot;The New English Weekly&quot;. Dylan Thomas&#x27;s first published poem, &quot;And Death Shall Have No Dominion&quot;, appeared in its issue dated 18 May 1933, but by then, the magazine was not selling well and Orage was experiencing financial difficulties.

In September 1933, Jessie gave birth to their daughter, Ann. In January 1934, Senator Bronson M. Cutting presented Orage&#x27;s Social Credit Plan to the United States Senate, proposing that it become one of the tools of Roosevelt&#x27;s economic policy.

At the beginning of August 1934, Gurdjieff asked Orage to prepare a new edition of &quot;The Herald of Coming Good&quot;. On 20 August, Orage wrote his last letter to Gurdjieff: &quot;Dear Mr Gurdjieff, I&#x27;ve found very little to revise…&quot;

Towards the end of his life, Orage was suffered from severe pain below the heart. This ailment had been diagnosed a couple of years before as simply functional and he did not again seek medical advice. While he was broadcasting a speech as part of the BBC series, &quot;Poverty in Plenty&quot;, once again expounding the doctrine of social credit, he experienced excruciating pain, but he continued as if nothing was happening. After leaving the studio he spent the evening with his wife and friends and made plans to see the doctor next day, but he died in his sleep that night. Orage&#x27;s former students of the Gurdjieff System arranged for the enneagram to be inscribed on his tombstone.

<text>The Comedy Store is an American comedy club opened in April 1972. It is located in West Hollywood, California, at 8433 Sunset Boulevard on the Sunset Strip. An associated club is located in La Jolla, San Diego, California.

==History==
The Comedy Store was opened in April 1972 by comedians Sammy Shore (1927–2019), and Rudy De Luca. The building was formerly the home of Club Seville (1935), later, Ciro&#x27;s (1940–1957), a popular Hollywood nightclub owned by William Wilkerson, and later Ciro&#x27;s Le Disc, a rock and roll venue, where the Byrds were discovered in 1964.

When the venue reopened as The Comedy Store in 1972, it included a 99-seat theatre. As a result of a divorce settlement, Sammy Shore&#x27;s ex-wife Mitzi Shore began operating the club in 1973, and she was able to buy the building in 1976. She immediately renovated and expanded the club to include a 450-seat main room.

In 1974, The Comedy Store hosted the wedding reception of newlyweds Liza Minnelli and Jack Haley, Jr. The Comedy Club signage was covered, for the evening, by signs reading &quot;Ciro&#x27;s&quot;, denoting the venue&#x27;s prior identity. The event was attended by many dozens of Hollywood glitterati, including Elizabeth Taylor, Sammy Davis Jr., Cher, Bob Fosse, Johnny Carson, Goldie Hawn, Cesar Romero, Priscilla Presley and other stars, past and present.

==Locations==
The original Comedy Store on Sunset at Ciro&#x27;s had been joined by the Comedy Store Westwood, at 1621 Westwood Blvd., the Comedy Store La Jolla, at 916 Pearl St., Comedy Store Playhouse, on Las Palmas, Comedy Store at the Sheraton Universal Hotel, in Universal City, and the Comedy Store Las Vegas at the Dunes Hotel.

==Job action==
Beginning in 1979, The Comedy Store served for many years as the host location for the annual &quot;HBO Young Comedians&quot; specials.

Tension between the club owners stems from a 1979 strike of Los Angeles comedians against the Comedy Store&#x27;s &quot;no-pay policy&quot;. Until that time, neither Shore nor Friedman paid comedians a salary. The theory was that comedians should almost be paying the owners for the exposure the clubs provided. When the comedians&#x27; strike began, The Improv (opened in 1974 at 8162 Melrose Avenue) was closed for fire-damage repairs. Therefore, the strike focused on Shore, not Friedman.

Also in 1979, stand-up comedians formed a short-lived labor union and demanded to be paid for their appearances at The Comedy Store. For six weeks (beginning in March), several comedians staged a protest in front of the club, while others crossed the picket line. The comedians involved formed a union called Comedians for Compensation and fought for pay where they had received none before. They eventually picketed in front of the club when their demands were not met. Jay Leno and David Letterman were among those on the picket line while Garry Shandling and Yakov Smirnoff crossed the line.

The job action was not legally a strike as the comedians were classified as &quot;independent contractors&quot; and were not under contract with the club.

Mitzi Shore argued that the club was and had always been a showcase and training ground for young comedians and was not about profits. She alleged that comedians came to the club and could work on their material in front of casting agents and other talent scouts who would possibly hire them as professionals if they were good enough.

The comedians at the club became unhappy when the club was expanded several times and it was perceived that Shore&#x27;s profits were quite substantial. Shore also paid the rest of her staff, including waitresses and bartenders.

After the strike, some comedians were no longer allowed to perform at the club, including Steve Lubetkin, who committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the Continental Hyatt House next door. His suicide note included the line: &quot;My name is Steve Lubetkin. I used to work at The Comedy Store.&quot; Lubetkin hoped that his suicide would resolve the labor dispute. He also cited Shore as the reason he no longer had a job.

The union ceased to exist in 1980, although from the time of the job action onward, comedians in Los Angeles were paid for their shows. This included The Comedy Store and The Improv.

== Cresthill house ==
&quot;When she and Sammy divorced in 1974, he gave her the club to lower his alimony payments; two years later, after being briefly evicted (and opening a new Comedy Store location in Westwood), she negotiated a deal to buy the entire building — plus Cresthill...around the time of Lubetkin’s suicide(After a bitter labor dispute between comedians and management&lt;ref name=&quot;cLA/pad&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), she essentially gave the place over to the comedians who worked at the Store.&quot;

Mitzi Shore also owned a 5,000-square-foot house a few doors away from the club, on 8420 Cresthill Road. The house was bought with the club in 1976. In 1979, she started to let the comedians from the clubs sleep there. During the 1980s, numerous comedians resided or just partied there, including Andrew Dice Clay, Marc Maron, Robin Williams, and Richard Pryor. Argus Hamilton and Mike Binder were the first to officially move into the house. Dave Coulier was also an early resident, and Yakov Smirnoff moved in in 1980. The place was known for its all-night parties and heavy consumption of cocaine and alcohol. Bill Hicks moved there in 1980 when he was 18 and running away from his parents to pursue his career as a comedian. Many of those comedians developed their style while residing there. Sam Kinison was a pillar there, and Jim Carrey turned his act around in this house. Mitzi Shore had a plan to cash in on the house&#x27;s unique atmosphere, and even shot a 12-minute pilot around 1987 starring Daphne Davis, Nancy Redman, and Tamayo Otsuki. In 1988, because of the debauchery that had been going on for years, Mitzi Shore kicked everybody out of the house and turned it into a recovery house. By the early 1990s, Her son Pauly moved into the house, and by the end of the 1990s, the house was sold.

<text>Beachampton is a village and civil parish beside the River Great Ouse in the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. The village is about east of Buckingham and a similar distance west of Milton Keynes.

==History==
The village toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;home farm by a stream&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Bechentone&quot;.

Parts of the village stand on high ground, but most of the village is prone to regular flooding by the stream that runs through the village, a tributary of the River Ouse.

The family name &quot;Beachampton&quot; originates in this village, and was first recorded in manorial records in 1175 when Osmer de Beachampton was a tenant here. There is no documentary evidence for the tradition that Hall Farm in Beachampton was the home of Catherine Parr when she was married to King Henry VIII.

Beachampton Hall, a Grade II* listed manor house, has elements dating from the 15th century. The present house was probably built by the Piggot family: Sir Thomas Piggot hosted a 1603 visit of Queen Anne of Denmark, wife of King James I and VI; the gardens were laid out at this time.

The Church of England parish church of the Assumption of St Mary the Virgin dates from the 14th century, and is grade II* listed. G.E. Street, a Gothic Revival architect, rebuilt upper part of the bell-tower in 1873–74. It has a large monument to Simon Benett Bt. (1682). The Bennetts (or Bennets) have been Lords of Beachampton (styled Lord de Beachampton) and of the neighbouring manor of Calverton since 1616. Both these manorial lordship titles, though not the lands, remain in the possession of the Bennett family to the present day.

The parish has a further nine listed buildings and structures.

<text>In programming language theory, semantics is the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. Semantics assigns computational meaning to valid strings in a programming language syntax. It is closely related to, and often crosses over with, the semantics of mathematical proofs.

Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be done by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or giving an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, thereby creating a model of computation.

==History==

In 1967, Robert W. Floyd published the paper &quot;Assigning meanings to programs&quot;; his chief aim was &quot;a rigorous standard for proofs about computer programs, including proofs of correctness, equivalence, and termination&quot;. Floyd further wrote:

A semantic definition of a programming language, in our approach, is founded on a syntactic definition. It must specify which of the phrases in a syntactically correct program represent commands, and what conditions must be imposed on an interpretation in the neighborhood of each command.
In 1969, Tony Hoare published a paper on Hoare logic seeded by Floyd&#x27;s ideas, now sometimes collectively called &quot;axiomatic semantics&quot;.

In the 1970s, the terms &quot;operational semantics&quot; and &quot;denotational semantics&quot; emerged.

==Overview==
The field of formal semantics encompasses all of the following:
*The definition of semantic models
*The relations between different semantic models
*The relations between different approaches to meaning
*The relation between computation and the underlying mathematical structures from fields such as logic, set theory, model theory, category theory, etc.

It has close links with other areas of computer science such as programming language design, type theory, compilers and interpreters, program verification and model checking.

==Approaches==
There are many approaches to formal semantics; these belong to three major classes:

* Denotational semantics, whereby each phrase in the language is interpreted as a &quot;denotation&quot;, i.e. a conceptual meaning that can be thought of abstractly. Such denotations are often mathematical objects inhabiting a mathematical space, but it is not a requirement that they should be so. As a practical necessity, denotations are described using some form of mathematical notation, which can in turn be formalized as a denotational metalanguage. For example, denotational semantics of functional languages often translate the language into domain theory. Denotational semantic descriptions can also serve as compositional translations from a programming language into the denotational metalanguage and used as a basis for designing compilers.
* Operational semantics, whereby the execution of the language is described directly (rather than by translation). Operational semantics loosely corresponds to interpretation, although again the &quot;implementation language&quot; of the interpreter is generally a mathematical formalism. Operational semantics may define an abstract machine (such as the SECD machine), and give meaning to phrases by describing the transitions they induce on states of the machine. Alternatively, as with the pure lambda calculus, operational semantics can be defined via syntactic transformations on phrases of the language itself;
* Axiomatic semantics, whereby one gives meaning to phrases by describing the &quot;axioms&quot; that apply to them. Axiomatic semantics makes no distinction between a phrase&#x27;s meaning and the logical formulas that describe it; its meaning &quot;is&quot; exactly what can be proven about it in some logic. The canonical example of axiomatic semantics is Hoare logic.

Apart from the choice between denotational, operational, or axiomatic approaches, most variations in formal semantic systems arise from the choice of supporting mathematical formalism.

==Variations==
Some variations of formal semantics include the following:

* Action semantics is an approach that tries to modularize denotational semantics, splitting the formalization process in two layers (macro and microsemantics) and predefining three semantic entities (actions, data and yielders) to simplify the specification;
* Algebraic semantics is a form of axiomatic semantics based on algebraic laws for describing and reasoning about program semantics in a formal manner. It also supports denotational semantics and operational semantics;
* Attribute grammars define systems that systematically compute &quot;metadata&quot; (called &quot;attributes&quot;) for the various cases of the language&#x27;s syntax. Attribute grammars can be understood as a denotational semantics where the target language is simply the original language enriched with attribute annotations. Aside from formal semantics, attribute grammars have also been used for code generation in compilers, and to augment regular or context-free grammars with context-sensitive conditions;
* Categorical (or &quot;functorial&quot;) semantics uses category theory as the core mathematical formalism. Categorical semantics is usually proven to correspond to some axiomatic semantics that gives a syntactic presentation of the categorical structures. Also, denotational semantics are often instances of a general categorical semantics;
* Concurrency semantics is a catch-all term for any formal semantics that describes concurrent computations. Historically important concurrent formalisms have included the actor model and process calculi;
* Game semantics uses a metaphor inspired by game theory;
* Predicate transformer semantics, developed by Edsger W. Dijkstra, describes the meaning of a program fragment as the function transforming a postcondition to the precondition needed to establish it.

==Describing relationships==
For a variety of reasons, one might wish to describe the relationships between different formal semantics. For example:
*To prove that a particular operational semantics for a language satisfies the logical formulas of an axiomatic semantics for that language. Such a proof demonstrates that it is &quot;sound&quot; to reason about a particular (operational) &quot;interpretation strategy&quot; using a particular (axiomatic) &quot;proof system&quot;.
*To prove that operational semantics over a high-level machine is related by a simulation with the semantics over a low-level machine, whereby the low-level abstract machine contains more primitive operations than the high-level abstract machine definition of a given language. Such a proof demonstrates that the low-level machine &quot;faithfully implements&quot; the high-level machine.

It is also possible to relate multiple semantics through abstractions via the theory of abstract interpretation.

<text>A rotary printing press is a printing press in which the images to be printed are curved around a cylinder. Printing can be done on various substrates, including paper, cardboard, and plastic. Substrates can be sheet feed or unwound on a continuous roll through the press to be printed and further modified if required (e.g. die cut, overprint varnished, embossed). Printing presses that use continuous rolls are sometimes referred to as &quot;web presses&quot;.

== Developmental history ==

William Nicholson filed a 1790 patent for a rotary press. The rotary press itself is an evolution of the cylinder press, also patented by William Nicholson, invented by Beaucher of France in the 1780s and by Friedrich Koenig in the early 19th century. Rotary drum printing was invented by Josiah Warren in 1832, whose design was later imitated by Richard March Hoe in 1843. An 1844 patent replaced the reciprocating platforms used in earlier designs with a fixed platform served by rotating drums, and through a series of advances a complete rotary printing press was perfected in 1846, and patented in 1847. It appeared in Edinburgh in 1851 and then traveled to London where it was used by the Times newspaper in 1853, where it then traveled to France in 1866 and Germany in 1873. By the time it reached Spain in 1885, it had become common use. Some sources describe the Parisian Hippolyte Auguste Marinoni as the inventor of the Rotary printing press, but this was the subject of a patent dispute that was decided in Hoe&#x27;s favor. A.S. Abell of the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; was the first American user of the rotary press.

== Types of rotary printing presses ==

Today, there are four main types of rotary presses; letterpress, offset (including web offset), rotogravure, and flexo (short for flexography). Although all the types use cylinders to print, they vary in their method.

*Rotary letterpress printing uses type metal plates molded in the form of a cylinder. The plates, called stereotypes, are coated with ink, then pressed against a continuous roll of paper. Rotary letterpress printing was used in the mid-twentieth century to print most major newspapers.
*In offset lithography, the image is chemically applied to a plate, generally through exposure of photosensitive layers on the plate material. Lithography is based on the fact that water and oil do not mix, which enables the planographic process to work. In the context of a printing plate, a wettable surface (the non-image area) may also be termed hydrophilic and a non-wettable surface (the image area) hydrophobic.
*Gravure is a process where small cells or holes are etched into a copper cylinder, which are able to be filled with ink. All the colours are etched in different angles, thus while printing every colour is placed in proper position to give the appropriate image.
*Flexography is a relief system in which a raised image is created on a typical polymer-based plate.

In stamp collecting, rotary-press-printed stamps are sometimes a different size than stamps printed with a flat plate. This happens because the stamp images are further apart on a rotary press, which makes the individual stamps larger (typically ).

<doc id="397612" wikidata="Q959608" url="?curid=397612" title="Bellingdon">
<text>Bellingdon is a village in the civil parish of Chartridge (where the 2011 Census was included), in Buckinghamshire, England. The name derives from the Anglo Saxon &quot;Bellingdenu&quot; or Bella&#x27;s Valley, and is recorded as &quot;Belenden&quot; in the 15th century. It is arranged along a ridge, typical of the Chiltern Hills to the north of Chesham.

==Early settlement==

Until the end of the 19th century Bellingdon consisted of a number of scattered farms including Bank, Peppetts, Bellingdon End, Bloomfield, Huge, Hazeldean and Vale Farms which were built in the late 16th or early 17th-century. The abundance of clay deposits led to a number of brickworks being established in the 19th century, two of which were: Bellingdon brickworks (now HG Matthews) in 1891 and another at Bloomfield Farm in 1899, then in the 20th century on Gyles Road and Oak Lane.
Bakers brickyard, known as Lower Kiln, was situated opposite Huge Farm and was owned by the Baker family for three generations since 1899 when Joseph Baker the youngest son of the brickmaking Bakers from nearby Wigginton bought the brickyard for £5 from a Mr Clarke. Joseph, followed by his son William and then William&#x27;s sons made bricks here until they ran out of clay in 1964. They were well known in the area for the excellent quality of their bricks.

==Modern day settlement==
The village hall was built around 1948 using a &#x27;standard hut&#x27; provided by the National Council for Social Service on land given by Miss Marian Thompson, the first W.I. President. Together with the adjoining playing fields, it is shared with the people of the nearby hamlet of Asheridge. In 2010 a grant was awarded to fund the construction of a playground next to the village hall. At the northern end of the village is the premises of The Bull public house which ceased to trade in the summer of 2009 and was boarded up, and beyond this the largest employer in the village, HG Matthews Brickworks which was acquired by the family in 1924. Also at this end of the village is the Bellingdon End Farm shop selling equestrian supplies, animal feed and clothing.

==Churches==
In the nineteenth century there was a Baptist meeting in the village at Peppett&#x27;s Green, which was run by the Congregational Church and the Lower Baptist Chapel (now Trinity Baptist) in Chesham. It is mentioned in the 1851 Ecclesiastical Census. Peppett&#x27;s Farm was owned by the Lower Baptist Church but sold in the 1920s.

St John&#x27;s Church, in the centre of the village, is part of the ecclesiastical parish of Great Chesham. The Anglican congregation started in the 1870s; in the 1880s it met in the Mission Room at Sun Cottage. The current tin tabernacle was built in 1901. In 1958, the building was named &quot;St John&#x27;s&quot;, after St John the Evangelist.

==Education==
There is no school in the village. Children under 11 attend Chartridge Combined School, Hawridge and Cholesbury Church of England School or Little Spring Primary School. The catchment area secondary schools are:- Chiltern Hills Academy and Chesham Grammar School in Chesham, Amersham School and Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School for boys in Amersham and Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School for girls in Little Chalfont.

==Notable people==
* D.H. Lawrence rented one of the three Bellingdon Farm cottages called &#x27;The Triangle&#x27; in Hawridge Lane for a short period between August 1914 and January 1915 during which time he wrote The Rainbow.

<doc id="397623" wikidata="Q2266278" url="?curid=397623" title="Imp">
<text>An imp is a European mythological being similar to a fairy or demon, frequently described in folklore and superstition. The word may perhaps derive from the term &quot;ympe&quot;, used to denote a young grafted tree.

Imps are often described as troublesome and mischievous more than seriously threatening or dangerous, and as lesser beings rather than more important supernatural beings. The attendants of the devil are sometimes described as imps. They are usually described as lively and having small stature.

==Etymology==
The Old English noun &quot;impa&quot; meant a young shoot or scion of a plant or tree, and later came to mean the scion of a noble house, or a child in general. Starting in the 16th century, it was often used in expressions like &quot;imps of serpents&quot;, &quot;imp of hell&quot;, &quot;imp of the devil&quot;, and so on; and by the 17th century, it came to mean a small demon, a familiar of a witch. The Old English noun and associated verb &quot;impian&quot; appear to come from an unattested Late Latin term *&quot;emputa&quot; (&quot;impotus&quot; is attested in the Salic law), the neuter plural of &#x27;natural, implanted, grafted&#x27;.

==History==
Unlike the Christian folklore, demons in Germanic legends were not necessarily always evil. Imps were often mischievous rather than evil or harmful. In some religions, they were attendants of the gods.

===The Lincoln Imp===

A legend in Lincolnshire dating to the 14th-century recounts that the devil, being annoyed with the completion of the cathedral, paid a visit, accompanied by two imps who proceeded to wreak havoc in the building. An angel appeared and ordered them to stop. One turned to throw a rock at the angel and was instantly petrified.

&lt;poem&gt;For the tiniest angel, with amethyst eyes,
And hair spun like gold, &#x27;fore the alter [sic] did rise,
Pronouncing these words in a dignified tone
&quot;O impious imp, be ye turned to stone!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

While his companion fled, the unfortunate imp remains enslaved by the Angel Choir at the east end of the cathedral. The imp is also depicted on the emblem of the local football team Lincoln City F.C. They are also nicknamed The Imps.

=== Other descriptions===
Imps are often shown as small in stature and not good-looking. Their behaviour is described as being wild and uncontrollable, much the same as fairies&#x27;, and in some cultures they are considered the same beings, both sharing the same sense of free spirit and enjoyment of all things fun. It was later in history that people began to associate fairies as being good and imps as being malicious and evil. However, both creatures were fond of pranks and misleading people. Most of the time, these pranks were harmless fun, but some could be upsetting and harmful, such as the switching of babies or leading travelers astray in places unfamiliar to them. Although imps are often thought of as being immortal, they can be damaged or harmed by certain weapons and enchantments, or be kept out of people&#x27;s homes by wards.

Imps were also portrayed as lonely little creatures in search of human attention, using jokes and pranks to attract human friendship. This often backfired when people became annoyed with the imp&#x27;s endeavours, usually driving it away.

Even if the imp was successful in getting the friendship it sought, it still often played pranks on its friend, either out of boredom or simply because this was the nature of the imp. This trait led to using the word “impish” for someone who loves pranks and practical jokes. Eventually, it came to be believed that imps were the familiar spirit servants of witches and warlocks, where the little demons served as spies and informants. During the time of the witch hunts, supernatural creatures such as imps were sought out as proof of witchcraft, though often the so-called imp was merely a black cat, a lizard, a toad or some other form of uncommon pet.

==== Objects ====
Imps have also been described as being “bound” or contained in some sort of object such as a sword or a crystal ball. In other cases, imps were simply kept in a certain object, and then summoned only when their masters had need of them. Some even had the ability to grant their owner&#x27;s wishes, much like a genie. This was the object of the 1891 story &quot;The Bottle Imp&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson, which told of an imp contained in a bottle that would grant the owner their every wish, but their soul would be sent to Hell if they didn&#x27;t sell the bottle to a new owner before their death.

==== Culture ====
Imps can be found in art and architecture throughout the world, most of the time carefully and painstakingly hidden and only being found by the most interested and observant of people.

<text>Biddlesden is a village and civil parish in Aylesbury Vale district in north-west Buckinghamshire, England on the boundary with Northamptonshire. It is about east-north-east of Brackley, Northamptonshire and north-west of Buckingham. The River Great Ouse forms part of the western boundary of the parish, separating the village from Northamptonshire. The ancient royal forest of Whittlewood extended to the northern edge of the village.

==History==
The village toponym is derived from the Old English for either &quot;house in a valley&quot; or &quot;Byttel&#x27;s valley&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village is recorded as &quot;Betesdene&quot;.

In 1147 Ernald de Bosco founded the Cistercian Biddlesden Abbey. In 1315, the village was granted a temporary charter to hold a weekly market. When the abbey was seized on behalf of Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was assessed to be earning in excess of £175 annually in rents and tithes.

Although the abbey continued after this time as living accommodation for those in favour with the monarch, the building was not maintained thoroughly and fell into disrepair. By the 18th century the abbey was in ruins and was finally demolished in 1727. The country house of Biddlesden Park was built on the same site.

Within the parish of Biddlesden there was the hamlet of Evershaw. In the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; at the time of King Edward the Confessor this settlement was listed as being in the possession of a &quot;certain bandy-legged man&quot;. Evershaw&#x27;s toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;boar wood&quot;. The family names &quot;Evershaw&quot; and &quot;Eversaw&quot; are derived from this place. No trace of the hamlet remains today.

<doc id="397650" wikidata="Q513200" url="?curid=397650" title="Judea and Samaria Area">
<text>The Judea and Samaria Area (; ) is an administrative division used by the State of Israel to refer to the entire West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, but excludes East Jerusalem (see Jerusalem Law). Its area is split into 165 Palestinian &quot;islands&quot; that are under total or partial civil administration by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), and a contiguous area containing 230 Israeli settlements into which Israeli law is &quot;pipelined&quot;.

While its area is internationally recognized as a part of the State of Palestine, some Israeli authorities group it together with the districts of Israel proper, largely for statistical purposes.

==Terminology==

=== Biblical significance ===
The Judea and Samaria Area covers a portion of the territory designated by the biblical names of Judea and Samaria. Both names are tied to the ancient Israelite kingdoms: the former corresponds to part of the Kingdom of Judah, also known as the Southern Kingdom; and the latter corresponds to part of the Kingdom of Israel, also known as the Northern Kingdom. In 1947, the terminology was noted by the United Nations in the Partition Plan for Palestine with the statement: &quot;the boundary of the hill country of Samaria and Judea starts on the Jordan River...&quot;

=== 1967 Arab–Israeli War ===
In 1967, the Six-Day War saw Israeli forces capture the Jordanian-annexed West Bank, marking the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the territory. Following its capture, the right-wing Israelis began to refer to the territories by their Hebrew-language names and argued for their integration into Israel on historical, religious, nationalist, and security grounds. In December 1967, the Israeli Military Governorate issued an order that stated: &quot;the term &#x27;Judea and Samaria region&#x27; shall be identical in meaning for all purposes to the term &#x27;the West Bank Region. By early 1968, &quot;Judea and Samaria&quot; had been formally adopted in official usage. However, the phrase was rarely used until 1977, when Menachem Begin, a proponent of extending Israel&#x27;s sovereignty to the region, was elected as Israel&#x27;s sixth prime minister.

The name &quot;Judea&quot;, when used in &quot;Judea and Samaria&quot;, refers to all of the area to the south of Jerusalem, including Gush Etzion and Har Hevron. The name &quot;Samaria&quot;, on the other hand, refers to all of the area to the north of Jerusalem. In 1980, East Jerusalem (a part of the West Bank) was effectively annexed by Israel and has since been under civilian administration; it is thus excluded from the administrative structure of the Judea and Samaria Area.
The names &quot;West Bank&quot; () or, alternatively, &quot;the Territories&quot; () are also current in Israeli usage. Generally, preference for one term over the other indicates the speaker&#x27;s position on the Israeli political spectrum. Left-wingers, who take the view that the territory should be evacuated under a peace agreement, prefer &quot;West Bank&quot;; conversely, right-wingers, who take the view that the territory should come under Israeli administration permanently, advocate the usage of &quot;Judea and Samaria&quot; (similar to the Derry/Londonderry name dispute in Northern Ireland).

== Status ==

The Judea and Samaria Area is administered by the Israel Defense Forces Central Command, and military law is applied. Administrative decisions are subject to the Command&#x27;s chief. The incumbent chief of Central Command is Aluf Nitzan Alon.

The future status of the region is a key factor in the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, adopted in November 1967, after Israel captured the region from Jordan in the Six-Day War, lists as its first principle &quot;the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security&quot; and called for the &quot;withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict&quot; in conjunction with the &quot;termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force&quot;.

The West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Gaza Strip are considered occupied Palestinian territories by the United Nations, the United States, the International Court of Justice, the European Union, and by non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and B&#x27;Tselem. The Supreme Court of Israel has considered the section of the West Bank which excludes East Jerusalem to be Israeli-occupied territories.

On 13 May 2012, a bill to extend Israeli law to the Israeli settlements in the Judea and Samaria Area initiated by Knesset member Miri Regev (Likud) first approved by the majority of the Ministerial Committee for Legislation was rejected in a second round of votes after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had instructed his ministers to vote against the bill. Extending Israeli law to the settlements would mean a de facto annexation of the settlements to Israel. In July 2012, a government-commissioned report from a three-member committee, called Levy Report, asserted, based on a number of reasons, that there is no legal basis under international law to refer to Judea and Samaria as &quot;occupied territory&quot;. Article 43 of the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 is the basis of the Levy committee&#x27;s opinion.

==Administrative local authorities==
The area is further divided into eight military administrative regions: Menashe (Jenin area), HaBik&#x27;a (Jordan Valley), Shomron (Shechem area, known in Arabic as Nablus), Efrayim (Tulkarm area), Binyamin (Ramallah/al-Bireh area), Maccabim (Maccabim area), Etzion (Bethlehem area) and Yehuda (Hebron area).

<text>Bishopstone is a small, rural village in the civil parish of Stone with Bishopstone and Hartwell in Aylesbury Vale, Buckinghamshire, England.

== History ==
The village name is a common one in England, and means &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Estate&quot;. It is not known to which Bishop this refers though as the village lies within the ancient diocese of Lincoln, it presumedly denotes property owned by the Bishop of Lincoln. The village was first recorded in manorial rolls of 1227 as &quot;Bissopeston&quot;.

== Location ==
Bishopstone resides amongst farm land just a mile east of Stone and two miles south of Aylesbury. The village is overlooked by the Chiltern Hills, most notably Coombe Hill with its Boer War memorial, a well known Buckinghamshire landmark and viewpoint. Bishopstone is easily accessible from the A418 which runs from Aylesbury to Thame in Oxfordshire.

== Amenities ==
Due to Bishopstone&#x27;s relatively remote location there is a limited bus service that makes a single return journey to Aylesbury, allowing a few hours in town, on Wednesdays and Fridays. The closest train stations are located in Aylesbury and at Little Kimble 2.5 miles south. The only pub in the village, The Harrow, was closed for 5 years but re-opened in October 2019 after a total refurbishment of both the grounds and building. There is no village shop; however neighbouring Stone is host to an Indian restaurant, a petrol filling station, antiques store, a grocery store and post office.

A coercive monopoly is not merely a sole supplier of a particular kind of good or service (a monopoly), but it is a monopoly where there is no opportunity to compete with it through means such as price competition, technological or product innovation, or marketing; entry into the field is closed. As a coercive monopoly is securely shielded from the possibility of competition, it is able to make pricing and production decisions with the assurance that no competition will arise. It is a case of a non-contestable market. A coercive monopoly has very few incentives to keep prices low and may deliberately price gouge consumers by curtailing production.

Coercive monopolies can arise in free market or via government intervention to institute them. Some conservative think tanks, such as the Foundation for Economic Education, define coercive monopolies solely as those established by the government or via the illegal use of force, excluding monopolies that arise in the free market. 

==Contrasted with other monopolies==

Exclusive control of electricity supply due to government-imposed &quot;utility&quot; status is a coercive monopoly because consumers have no choice but to pay the price that the monopolist demands. Consumers do not have an alternative to purchase electricity from a cheaper competitor, because the wires running into their homes belong to the monopolist.

Exclusive control of Coca-Cola, by contrast, is not a coercive monopoly because consumers have other cola brands to choose from and the Coca-Cola company is subject to competitive forces. Consequently, there is an upper limit to which the company can raise its prices before profits begin to erode because of the presence of viable substitute goods.

To maintain a &quot;non-coercive monopoly&quot;, a monopolist must make pricing and production decisions knowing that, if prices are too high or quality is too low, competition may arise from another firm that can better serve the market. If the non-coercive monopoly is successful, it is called an &quot;efficiency monopoly&quot;, because it has been able to keep production and supply costs lower than any other competitor so that it can charge a lower price than others and still be profitable. Since potential competitors are not able to be so efficient, they are not able to charge a lower or comparable price and still be profitable. Hence, competing against a non-coercive monopoly is possible but not profitable, whereas competing against a coercive monopoly is potentially profitable but not possible.

==Establishing a coercive monopoly==
According to business ethicist John Hasnas, &quot;most [contemporary business ethicists] take for granted that a free market produces coercive monopolies.&quot; However, some people, including Alan Greenspan and Nathaniel Branden, argue that such independence from competitive forces &quot;can be accomplished only by an act of government intervention, in the form of special regulations, subsidies, or franchises.&quot; Some point out that a coercive monopolist may &quot;employ violence&quot; to create or maintain a coercive monopoly.

Some recommend that government &quot;create&quot; coercive monopolies. For example, claims of natural monopoly are often used as justification for government intervening to establish a statutory monopoly (government monopoly or government-granted monopoly) where competition is outlawed, under the claim that multiple firms providing a good or service entails more collective costs to an economy than would be the case if a single firm provided that good or service. This has often been done with electricity, water, telecommunications, and mail delivery. Some economists believe that such coercive monopolies are beneficial because of greater economies of scale and because they are more likely to act in the national interest. Conversely, Judge Richard Posner famously argued in &quot;Natural Monopoly and Its Regulation&quot; that the deadweight losses associated with regulating such monopolies were greater than any possible benefit.

==Private coercion==
A corporation which successfully engages in coercion to the extent that it eliminates the possibility of competition operates a coercive monopoly. A firm may use illegal or non-economic methods, such as extortion, to achieve and retain a coercive monopoly position. A company which has become the sole supplier of a commodity through non-coercive means (such as by simply outcompeting all other firms) may theoretically then go on to become a coercive monopoly if it maintains its position by engaging in coercive barriers to entry. The most famous historical examples of this type of coercive monopoly began in 1920, when the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution went into effect. This period, called Prohibition, presented lucrative opportunities for organized crime to take over the importation (&quot;bootlegging&quot;), manufacture, and distribution of alcoholic beverages. Al Capone, one of the most famous bootleggers, built his criminal empire largely on profits from illegal alcohol and effectively used coercion (including murder) to impose barriers to entry on his competitors. However, even private coercive monopolies almost invariably require government support, whether direct or indirect. In Capone&#x27;s case, the U.S. government created the necessary conditions for a coercive monopoly by outlawing the manufacture and sale of alcohol, thereby enabling unnaturally high profits on the black market, and was not providing the usual service of enforcing trade contracts. Likewise, some corrupt public officials took bribes that ensured that Capone would receive preferential treatment against potential competitors.

==Antitrust==
The ability of firms in a coercive monopoly to increase their profits through setting prices above competitive levels brings about the need for antitrust law. There are examples in history wherein a firm that is not a government-granted monopoly is claimed to have a coercive monopoly, and antitrust action has been initiated to resolve the perceived problem. For example, in &quot;United States v. Microsoft Corp.&quot;, the plaintiff&#x27;s finding of fact alleged that Microsoft &quot;coerced&quot; Apple Computer to enter into contracts resulting in the prohibition of competition. Eric Raymond, an author and one of the founders of the Open Source Initiative, says &quot;The thing a lot of people somehow missed is that the courts affirmed the findings of fact – that Microsoft is indeed a coercive monopoly.&quot; 

Another disputed example is the case of &quot;U.S. v. Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa)&quot; in 1945. The court concluded that Alcoa &quot;excluded competitors.&quot; The ruling is heavily criticized for punishing efficiency and is quoted below:

It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demand for ingot and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity before others entered the field. It insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to face every newcomer with new capacity already geared into a great organization, having the advantage of experience, trade connections and the elite of personnel.

However, antitrust law varies across the United States and the European Union. Specifically, in the U.S. monopoly pricing is not regulated. Whereas the European Community (EC) considers excessive pricing as an abuse of dominance and those involved can be fined or subject to prohibitory orders. This difference in regulation highlights the need to level out antitrust laws across the world in order to control this exclusionary and exploitive conduct in coercive monopolies. 

==Government monopolies==
Undisputed examples of coercive monopolies are those that are enforced by law. In a government monopoly, an agency under the direct authority of the government itself holds the monopoly, and the coercive monopoly status is sustained by the enforcement of laws or regulations that ban competition, or reserve exclusive control over factors of production for the government. The state-owned petroleum companies that are common in oil-rich developing countries (such as Aramco in Saudi Arabia or PDVSA in Venezuela) are examples of government monopolies created through nationalization of resources and existing firms. 

The United States Postal Service is an example of a coercive monopoly created through laws that ban potential competitors such as UPS or FedEx from offering competing services (in this case, first-class and standard (formerly called &quot;third-class&quot;) mail delivery). Government monopolies also mandate taxpayers to subsidize these firms. Thus, if the government protection the United States Postal Service was lifted and mail delivery could be included in free competition, the number of entrants into the industry would likely increase.

Government-granted monopolies often closely resemble government monopolies in many respects, but the two are distinguished by the decision-making structure of the monopolist. In a government monopoly, the holder of the monopoly is the government itself and the group of people who make business decisions is an agency under the government&#x27;s direct authority. In a government-granted monopoly, the coercive monopoly is enforced through law, but the holder of the monopoly is formally a private firm, or a subsidiary division of a private firm, which makes its own business decisions. Examples of government-granted monopolies include cable television and water providers in many municipalities in the United States, exclusive petroleum exploration grants to companies such as Standard Oil in many countries, and historically, lucrative colonial &quot;joint stock&quot; companies such as the Dutch East India Company, which were granted exclusive trading privileges with colonial possessions under mercantilist economic policy. Intellectual property such as copyrights and patents are government-granted monopolies. Another example is the thirty-year government-granted monopoly that was granted to Robert Fulton by the State of New York in steamboat traffic, but was later ruled by the United States Supreme Court to be unconstitutional because of a conflicting inter-state grant to Thomas Gibbons by the federal Congress.

Economist Lawrence Reed says that a government can cause a coercive monopoly without explicitly banning competition by &quot;simply [bestowing] privileges, immunities, or subsidies on one firm while imposing costly requirements on all others.&quot; For example, Alan Greenspan, in his essay &quot;Antitrust&quot;, argues that land subsidies to railroad companies in the western portion of the U.S. in 19th century created a coercive monopoly position. He says that &quot;with the aid of the federal government, a segment of the railroad industry was able to &#x27;break free&#x27; from the competitive bounds which had prevailed in the East.&quot; In addition, regulations may be established that place financial burdens on smaller firms that attempt to compete with larger, more established firms that are better able to absorb the regulatory costs.

==The state as a coercive monopoly==
Economist Murray Rothbard, noted for his espousal of anarcho-capitalism, argues that the state itself is a coercive monopoly as it uses force to establish &quot;a compulsory monopoly over police and military services, the provision of law, judicial decision-making, the mint and the power to create money, unused land (&#x27;the public domain&#x27;), streets and highways, rivers and coastal waters, and the means of delivering mail.&quot; He says that &quot;a coercive monopolist tends to perform his service badly and inefficiently&quot;.

These state-owned companies create an issue of setting unrealistic prices for unreliable services. An example of this was seen in Europe during the late 1980s when bank mergers decreased competition in the banking market. As a result, this coercive behaviour allowed them to sustain high interest rates until the early 1990s, severely impacting their customers. In addition to moral arguments over the use of force, free market anarchists often argue that if these services were open to competition that the market could supply them at a lower price and higher quality.

==Unions==

Labor unions have been called coercive monopolies which keep wage rates higher than they would otherwise be if individuals competed with each other for wages. Economists who believe this to be the case refer to this as a monopoly wage. This has raised some conversing opinions about the power of unions to contradict antitrust laws. Specifically, collusive methods to increases prices is illegal on public policy standards, but raising labour prices is encouraged. In addition, the unions participating in collective bargaining is applauded for its peaceful dispute settlement tactics, but this can also be seen as prohibited coercive behaviour. Nonetheless, as the intention behind these coercive actions in unions are for the benefit of workers rather than company profits, antitrust laws have not been held against these unions.

<text>Kiwanis International ( ) is an international service club founded in 1915 in Detroit, Michigan. It is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, and is found in more than 80 nations and geographic areas. In 1987, the organization began to accept women as members. Kiwanis and its affiliated clubs have more than 600,000 members. Kiwanis clubs raise over $100 million each year and report over 18.5 million volunteer hours to strengthen communities and serve children.

Kiwanis International is a volunteer-led organization led by a Board of Trustees with 19 members, including 15 trustees, four elected officers, and an executive director. The trustees are elected for three-year terms, with five trustees being elected each year. According to the bylaws, nine trustees are elected from the US and Pacific Canada Region, one trustee from the Canada and Caribbean Region, two trustees from the European Region, two trustees from the Asia-Pacific Region, and one trustee elected &quot;at large&quot; from any region other than the US and Pacific Canada Region. The elected officers included (in order of progression): the vice president, president-elect, president and immediate past president. These officers, along with the United States and Pacific Canada Region trustees, are elected at the annual convention of Kiwanis International. All trustees and officers are unpaid volunteers. The executive director is a full-time employee who is responsible for the organization&#x27;s paid staff and serves as a non-voting member of the Board.

There are seven regions in Kiwanis: Africa; Asia-Pacific; Canada and Caribbean; Europe; Latin America; Middle East; and the United States and Pacific Canada. The United States and Pacific Canada Region incorporates the 50 states of the United States as well as British Columbia and the Yukon Territory of Canada.

There are fifty-three administrative areas called districts. District boards typically consist of a governor-elect, governor, immediate-past governor, secretary, treasurer, and several trustees or lieutenant governors. Districts are further divided into service areas called divisions, comprising 5 to 20 clubs and headed by a lieutenant governor. Clubs have boards consisting of a vice president (and/or president elect), president, immediate past president, secretary, treasurer, and typically about five directors. At both the district and club level, the secretary/treasurer may be combined by one person and may be a volunteer or a paid employee; all other positions are unpaid.

== Etymology ==

The name “Kiwanis” was coined from the Ojibwe language expression derived from the word &quot;giiwanizi&quot; meaning to &quot;fool around&quot;: &quot;ningiiwaniz&quot;, which is found in the Baraga Dictionary as &quot;nin Kiwanis&quot;, meaning &quot;I make noise; I am foolish and wanton&quot; or &quot;I play with noise&quot;. Although Random House Dictionary states that it comes from one of the Algonquian languages and means &quot;to make oneself known&quot;, in Ojibwe and other related Algonquian languages, this expression would be &quot;gikendami&#x27;idizo&quot;. Whatever the original meaning may be, the organization&#x27;s founders translated it as &quot;We Build&quot;, which became the original motto of Kiwanis. In 2005 the organization chose a new motto, &quot;Serving the Children of the World&quot;. Members of the club are called Kiwanians.

== Ideals ==

===Defining statement===
&quot;Kiwanis is a global organization of volunteers dedicated to improving the world, one child and one community at a time.&quot;

===Motto===
Kiwanis&#x27; motto is &quot;Serving the Children of the World.&quot; The original motto was &quot;We Trade&quot;. A new motto of &quot;We Build&quot; was adopted during the 1920 International Convention and represented Kiwanis for more than 80 years.
===Objectives===
The six permanent Objectives of Kiwanis International were approved by Kiwanis club delegates at the 1924 Convention in Denver, Colorado.
* To give primacy to the human and spiritual rather than to the material values of life
* To encourage the daily living of the Golden Rule in all human relationships
* To promote the adoption and the application of higher social, business, and professional standards
* To develop, by precept and example a more intelligent, aggressive, and serviceable citizenship
* To provide, through Kiwanis clubs, a practical means to form enduring friendships, render altruistic service, and to build better communities
* To cooperate in creating and maintaining that sound public opinion and high idealism which make possible the increase of righteousness, justice, patriotism, and goodwill

==History==
The organization originated in August 1914 in Detroit, Michigan from a conversation between Allen S. Browne and Joseph G. Prance. Browne&#x27;s idea was to solicit business and professional men asking them if they would be interested in organizing a fraternal organization with a health benefit feature. Browne was compensated five dollars per new member that joined for his operating budget. Browne and Prance set out and recruited enough members to apply to the state for a not for profit status. The state approved the application on January 21, 1915 and the Supreme Lodge Benevolent Order Brothers were formed. The name was changed to Kiwanis a year later. The Kiwanis Club of Detroit is the original local club in Kiwanis. By 1927 the organization had more than 100,000 members.

Kiwanis became international with the organization of the Kiwanis Club of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, in 1916. Kiwanis limited its membership to the United States and Canada until 1962, when worldwide expansion was approved. Since then, Kiwanis has spread to all inhabited continents of the globe.

The original purpose of Kiwanis was to exchange business between members and to serve the poor. The debate as to whether to focus on networking or service was resolved in 1919, when Kiwanis adopted a service-focused mission. In 1924, the Objects of Kiwanis were adopted (see above) and remain unchanged today.

Each year, clubs sponsor nearly 150,000 service projects, complete more than 18.5 million hours in volunteer service and raise more than $100 million. As a global project in coordination with UNICEF, members and clubs contributed more than $80 million toward the global elimination of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Beginning in 2010 Kiwanis International joined with UNICEF to launch a new worldwide health initiative, The Eliminate Project, dedicated to wiping out maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT), which kills more than 100,000 babies worldwide each year.

Until 1987 the organization accepted only men as members. By action of the International Convention in 1987, the rules were changed to admit women as well. Women constitute about 26% of total members. At the 2013 International Convention, Sue Petrisin was elected as the organization&#x27;s first female international vice president. Petrisin was installed as Kiwanis International President in 2015, the year of the organization&#x27;s 100th anniversary. She is the first woman to lead any major member service organization.

==Service==
Kiwanis clubs decide for themselves what projects to do in their community, based on their own community&#x27;s needs and their members&#x27; interests. Service to children is a primary focus in Kiwanis. Clubs are encouraged to conduct a community survey each year to determine what unmet needs exist in their community. In some cases, clubs in a geographic region (a &quot;Division&quot; or &quot;District&quot;) may take on a project of shared interest, such as paediatric trauma, or children&#x27;s cancer.

Service may be provided directly (e.g. reading to children at the library or taking therapy dogs into seniors&#x27; facilities) or through raising funds in the community to meet a community need (such as building a playground). Common fund-raising events include breakfast such as pancake feeds, peanut sales, or food concessions. Areas of service may include assistance to those living in poverty, projects that benefit children and youth, and services for the sick or elderly.

As a global project in coordination with UNICEF, members and clubs contributed more than $80 million toward the global elimination of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD), the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability. Beginning in 2010 Kiwanis International once again joined with UNICEF to launch a new worldwide health initiative, dedicated to wiping out maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT), which kills more than 50,000 babies and a significant number of women each year. The clubs are known for the &quot;Kiwanis doll&quot;. Kiwanis dolls are simple white fabric dolls which is distributed to children and allows the children to color them in to represent themselves or someone else.

In 2007, the charitable financial arm, Kiwanis International Foundation, was awarded the top rating by an independent evaluator.

==Kiwanis family==
Kiwanis provides leadership and service opportunities for youth through its Service Leadership Programs. Aktion Club, Key Club, Circle K, Builders Club and K-Kids are part of Kiwanis Service Leadership Programs. They are sponsored by a local Kiwanis club and receive funding and leadership guidance from Kiwanis.

===Key Club===
Kiwanis founded and supports Key Club International. Started in Sacramento, California in 1925, Key Club is the oldest and largest service program for high school students in the world. As of 2010, Key Club has 250,000 members in 5,000 clubs in 30 nations, primarily in the United States and Canada, but with clubs also in Central and South America, Caribbean nations, Asia, and Australia. KIWIN&#x27;S (pronounced &quot;kee-wins&quot;), a high school program exclusive to the California-Nevada-Hawaii district, operates under the umbrella of Key Club but elects its own officers.

===Circle K===
The collegiate version of Kiwanis, which maintains some autonomy from Kiwanis, is Circle K International, also known as CKI. The first official Circle K club was chartered in September, 1947 at the campus of Carthage College (then in Illinois). As of 2010, Circle K membership is 12,600 members in 500 clubs in 17 countries, making Circle K the largest collegiate service organization of its kind in the world.

===K-Kids, Builders Club, Aktion Club, Kiwanis Junior===
K-Kids is intended for grades 4–5 in elementary school, and has a membership of 33,000 in 1,100 clubs in 8 nations. Builders Club (middle school) has 42,000 members in 1,400 clubs in 12 nations. Aktion Club (for people who have disabilities) has 8,400 members in 400 clubs in 7 nations. These programs are all led by adult advisors (Kiwanians or faculty members), whereas Key Club and Circle K elect their own club, district, and International officers each year to lead the organization. Kiwanis Junior is part of the European Service Leadership Program, with clubs in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy, and is typically for people ages 18–35.

===Kiwaniannes===
Before 1987, women&#x27;s auxiliary clubs known as Kiwaniannes also existed, made up of wives of members of the men-only Kiwanis clubs. With the changes that made it possible for women to join Kiwanis clubs, official sponsorship of the Kiwaniannes clubs ended. Some Kiwaniannes clubs merged with their affiliated Kiwanis club, while others converted into independent Kiwanis clubs.

<doc id="397680" wikidata="Q2394847" url="?curid=397680" title="Brill, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Brill is a village and civil parish in west Buckinghamshire, England, close to the border with Oxfordshire. It is about north-west of Long Crendon and south-east of Bicester. At the 2011 Census, the population of the civil parish was 1,141. Brill has a royal charter to hold a weekly market, but has not done so for many years.

==Toponymy==
Brill&#x27;s name is tautological, being a combination of Brythonic and Anglo Saxon words for &#x27;hill&#x27; (Brythonic &quot;breg&quot; and Anglo Saxon &quot;hyll&quot;). The name attracted the attention of J. R. R. Tolkien, who based the Middle-earth village of Bree upon it.

==Manor==

The manor of Brill was the administration centre for the royal hunting Forest of Bernwood and was for a long time a property of the Crown. King Edward the Confessor had a palace here. There is evidence that Henry II, John, Henry III and Stephen all held court at the palace. It remained in place until the time of Charles I, who turned the building into a Royalist garrison in the English Civil War. This led the Parliamentarian John Hampden to destroy it in 1643.

==Church and priory==
The Church of England parish church of All Saints was built early in the 12th century, and its nave and chancel remain essentially Norman structures. The chancel&#x27;s north wall has a blocked lancet window from that period. The pointed chancel arch is 13th century. The Perpendicular Gothic west tower was built early in the 15th century. The present chancel roof dates from the 17th century.

The north aisle was built in 1839 but its east window dates from about 1275. In 1888 All Saints&#x27; was largely rebuilt under the direction of John Oldrid Scott. Scott extended the chancel eastwards by about and added a new Gothic Revival east window. He added the south aisle and porch at the same time but its east and west windows are re-used Perpendicular Gothic ones, probably dating from early in the 16th century.

All Saints was a chapel of ease to the nearby parish of Oakley from the 12th until the 16th century. It belonged to the Priory of St Frideswide, Oxford until the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Brill had a hermitage or priory dedicated to St. Werburgh that was annexed to Chetwode Priory from 1251. Chetwode Priory surrendered the advowson of the hermitage to the Bishop of Lincoln in 1460.

==Brill windmill==
Brill is also known for its windmill, last owned and used by the Pointer and Nixie family who also baked bread in their house in the village. With timbers dating from 1685, Brill Windmill provides one of the earliest and best preserved examples of a post mill (the earliest type of European windmill) in the UK. Management and ownership of the Grade II* listed mill was passed to Buckinghamshire County Council in 1947 who, through a number of major interventions, have ensured that the mill still stands today. In 1967 the Council installed a structural steel framework that helps to support the mill&#x27;s ancient timber frame but means that the mill is static and can no longer turn to face the wind.

===Restoration project===
By the 2000s water ingress and weathering had caused timber decay to the extent that the structure&#x27;s integrity was described as &quot;At risk&quot;. The Brill Windmill Management Group was established in 2007 to help plan a restoration project and to seek the necessary funds. With funding from English Heritage and WREN, full repair and preservation work was completed by July 2009. The mill is now structurally sound and once again open to the public, once a week, between March and September.

==Brill tramway==

Brill railway station was once a north-western terminus of the London Underground system.

After the completion in 1868 of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, the Duke of Buckingham built the light railway to provide freight access by rail to his estates at Wotton Underwood. The extension to Brill gave access to a brickworks there. The line was opened in 1871, and following public demand passenger facilities were provided early in 1872. Originally known as the Brill Tramway, the line&#x27;s name changed to &quot;Oxford and Aylesbury Tramroad&quot; when a company was formed in an abortive attempt to extend the line to Oxford; the biggest hindering expense was the cost of tunnelling under Brill Hill.

The original Quainton Road station was north of the Quainton–Waddesdon road, and wagons from the Brill line reached it by means of a wagon turntable; there was no direct access. When the Metropolitan Railway took over the line in 1896, it doubled the main line from Aylesbury and re-sited the station to its present position, replacing a level crossing with the present road over bridge; a running connection between the Brill line and the main line was constructed at that time. In 1935, on the creation of the LPTB, control was transferred to it from the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Committee which had taken it over in 1906; the whole branch was closed on 30 November 1935.

==Little London==
The hamlet of Little London to the south was part of Brill parish until 1934, when Buckinghamshire County Council moved the parish boundary and transferred the hamlet to Oakley. When the Metropolitan railway built Brill station, it has been said that in honour of the metropolitan ambience the planners were trying to evoke, another Little London was founded to the north of the village.

==Amenities==
Brill Church of England Combined School is a mixed, voluntary controlled, Church of England primary school. It takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has about 175 pupils.

==Notable people==

*Thomas Edwards, recipient of the Victoria Cross for actions at the Battle of Tamai during the Mahdist War, was born in the village.
* James Govier (1910–1974), a British painter, etcher, and engraver, produced images of Brill church and windmill, along with images of Buckinghamshire. Govier&#x27;s family originated from Brill and the adjoining parish of Oakley, and he was born in Oakley. Examples of Govier&#x27;s work can be seen at the County Museum in Aylesbury and at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
* The perpetrators of the Great Train Robbery of 1963 hid at the remote Leatherslade Farm on Brill&#x27;s boundary with the village of Oakley.
* Mick Pointer, drummer and founding member of the progressive rock bands Marillion and Arena, was born on 22 July 1956 in Brill.
* Thomas Belson, one of the Oxford Martyrs, was born in Brill on an unknown date (circa 1560). He was found guilty of assisting Roman Catholic priests, and was executed with his companions at Oxford on 5 July 1589. He was beatified in 1987.
* Gavin Free, a slow-motion cinematographer, is from Brill. He is a producer of content for popular Internet group Rooster Teeth as a member of the Achievement Hunter cast, and founded the successful YouTube channel &quot;The Slow Mo Guys&quot;, which has over 1 billion views.

==References in literature==
*Referring to the Otmoor riots:
*There is a rhyme about &quot;Brill on the hill&quot;:
*Another rhyme ran: &quot;Brill on the hill, Oakley in the hole, dirty Ickford and stinking Worminghall&quot;.
*Edward Lear makes reference to Brill in &quot;&quot; (1872)&quot;:

&quot;There was an old person of Brill,&lt;br&gt;
Who purchased a shirt with a frill;&lt;br&gt;
But they said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you wish,&lt;br&gt;
You mayn&#x27;t look like a fish,&lt;br&gt;
You obsequious old person of Brill?&#x27;&quot;

*The name and various other features of Brill were used by J. R. R. Tolkien as the basis for the village of Bree in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He also used other nearby places in Oxfordshire as part of the Shire, sometimes using the same names, such as Buckland.
*John Betjeman rejoiced that the long arm of Metro-land was halted before impinging on &quot;the remote hilltop village of Brill&quot;.

<doc id="397683" wikidata="Q2019268" url="?curid=397683" title="Book of Moroni">
<text>The Book of Moroni () is the last of the books that make up the Book of Mormon. According to the text it was written by the prophet Moroni sometime between 400 and 421 CE. Moroni consists of ten chapters.

== Narrative ==
Moroni&#x27;s people had been destroyed by the Lamanites down to the very last person. They were hunting Moroni so they could make the genocide complete. But when he was not fleeing for his life, he took the time to write a few things that might be edifying to those same Lamanites.

The first thing he wrote down was the procedure that Jesus used to make apostles, priests, and teachers. Then he described the procedure for administering the ordinances of the Last Supper and baptism. If a member of the church committed sin, and three witnesses condemned them before the church elders and they still did not repent, then their names were blotted out of the church rolls.

Moroni chapter 8 is an epistle from Mormon to his son Moroni written soon after his son was elevated to the ministry, and it focuses almost solely on the doctrine of baptism. Specifically, it calls infant baptism extreme error.

Mormon says that Jesus came to call sinners to repentance, but children are not capable of committing sin. Mormon denies the dogma of original sin.

In Moroni chapter 9, his father Mormon reports that he is still alive, but the Lamanites were victorious in battle, and a number of leading Nephites have been slain. Mormon fears that the Lamanites will utterly destroy his people. Nevertheless, he is still preaching the Word of God to them, but when he uses harsh words they get angry, and when he uses soft words they harden their hearts against it.

The Lamanites took many prisoners in the battle. They slew all the men. They fed to the women the flesh of their husbands and they fed the children the flesh of their fathers, and gave them almost no water.

Still, these atrocities pale in comparison to those of the Nephites in Mariantum, who availed themselves of the daughters of the Lamanites, tortured them to death, and ate their flesh. Mormon asks his son, rhetorically, how God could be expected to withhold judgment from such a people. He especially grieves for the widows and their daughters in Sherrizah, who are starving because both armies have carried away most of the food. And Mormon can do nothing for them, because the army of the Lamanites is between him and that city.

In 421 CE, Moroni wrote a few more things before adding his plates to the ones his father sealed up in the hill Cumorah. He asks anyone who reads these records in the latter days to ponder them in his heart and ask God in prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, if the things are true. And if they ask with a sincere heart, the truth of them will be made manifest through the power of the Holy Spirit.

==Analysis==

Chapter 1 is a short introduction. Chapters 2–6 contain some direction as to how the church was organized. The ordinances of baptism, the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and the sacrament are detailed. Also, some general instruction on the laws in the church are given.

Chapter 7 is a sermon that Mormon gave to the Nephites. This sermon focuses on the essence of good and evil.

Mormon finishes by talking about miracles, faith, hope, and charity.

Chapters 8 and 9 contain two epistles to Moroni from his father, Mormon. The first talks about the beginnings of apostasy among the Nephites, focusing particularly on the practice of infant baptism. The second details the awful state of the Nephites and foreshadows their destruction.

Chapter 10 contains Moroni&#x27;s Promise and some advice for people in the present day. He writes about spiritual gifts, faith, hope and charity. Moroni declares that his words are the words of one &quot;speaking out of the dust&quot; which alludes to a prophecy of Isaiah (see Isaiah 29:4).

<doc id="397687" wikidata="Q7589137" url="?curid=397687" title="St Joseph's College, Hong Kong">
<text>St. Joseph&#x27;s College also referred to by its acronym SJC is an elite Catholic all-boys secondary education institution run by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Central Mid-Levels district, Hong Kong. It was established by the French De La Salle Christian Brothers on 7 November 1875. It is the oldest Catholic boys&#x27; secondary school and one of the leading boys&#x27; schools in Hong Kong. It typically has about 1,000 students. Subjects are taught in English, except for Chinese-related subjects and French and Japanese language studies.

The sponsoring body of the College is the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, incorporated in Hong Kong under the St Joseph&#x27;s College Incorporation Ordinance, Cap. 1048 of the Laws of Hong Kong. The stated mission of the College is &quot;to educate students in areas of intellectual, physical, social, moral and emotional development&quot; and &quot;to impart a human and Christian education...and to do so with &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;zeal&quot;.&quot;

The north and west blocks of the College are declared monuments of Hong Kong. The extension of the campus at 26 Kennedy Road is also a Grade I historic building.

The school has educated Olympians, local public figures and a Nobel laureate (Professor Charles Kao, Father of fibre optics), and members of Hong Kong&#x27;s most prominent families.

==History==

===Founding of the College (1875-1880)===
The College was previously a Portuguese commercial school named St Saviour&#x27;s College, located on Pottinger Street in 1860. Father Timoleon Raimondi, the bishop of the Colony, convinced Rome to send the Lasallian Brothers to the British Colony.

On 7 November 1875, six Lasallian Brothers arrived in Hong Kong: Brothers Hidulphe Marie (Director), Hidulphe de Jesus, and Hebertus from the Boarding school of Marseilles, Brother Adrian Edmund and Aldolphus Marie from the Novitiate of London and Brother Isfrid from Paris. They renamed the school after Saint Joseph, the patron saint of workers and of the Universal Church.

At the time of the takeover, the school had just 75 students. Later that year, however, hundreds of Portuguese families had taken refuge in Hong Kong after a disastrous typhoon had swept over Macau causing the school&#x27;s enrolment to double after just a few weeks. As a result, Brother Hidulphe had to suspend the intake of Chinese students. To accommodate the increased number of students, Buxley Lodge, a house at 99 Caine Road, was purchased in 1876.

===Robinson Road (1881-1917)===

In April 1880, Brother Cyprian was appointed director. He had been a teacher in New York and Quebec, had held the directorship of several schools in his native land, Canada, and had taught in London and Paris. In order to cater to the needs of the fast-growing school, a piece of land in Glenealy below Robinson Road was bought, and a two-story Victorian building became home to the College in 1881.

In January 1884, Brother Ivarch Louis took over the directorship and was succeeded in 1889 by Brother Abban. Enrolment had then increased to 409, and two Chinese were employed as staff members by the college; in the same year, a third floor was added to the school building to accommodate boarders. The additional wings were added in 1901.

===The Kennedy Road campus (1918- )===


On 13 February 1918, the Robinson Road campus was severely damaged by an earthquake. The Club Germania at 7 Kennedy Road was purchased on 3 September. Because pupils living on the Kowloon side had to cross both ways by ferry every day, a branch school was set up on Chatham Road, Kowloon, which became the La Salle College in 1932.

During the Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945, the College was used as a clinical depot by the Imperial Japanese Army. Some Brothers fled to Vietnam and became guests of the Dominicans and the Jesuits, while others were kept as prisoners of war in the local concentration camps. The campus was kept in shape by a minor staffer called Ah Yiu, who also smuggled essentials into the camps for the Brothers.

The College resumed classes after the war. In 1962, Club Germania was demolished and the modern eight-storey New Building was erected under Principal Brother Brenden Dunne.

==Campus==
The College is near the central business district of Hong Kong. Its architecture is a combination of typical colonial European (British Imperialist) and modern styles. The Charles Kao Block (Old Building, north block), constructed in 1920, houses most of the classrooms. The Chapel Block (west block) houses the Old Hall, music room, laboratories, lecture room and the school chapel. These buildings were built in a Colonial style reflecting European influences. The two blocks are declared monuments of Hong Kong since August 2000.

The modern New Building (south block), which replaced the original Club Germania on the site, houses the New Hall, senior laboratories, a library, computer rooms and a basketball court.

In 2016, the College successfully acquired the former St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational Primary School at 26 Kennedy Road, a Grade 1 Historical Building, from the Education Bureau. This block houses F4 and F6 classrooms, and the music hall.

A plan called &quot;Vision 22&quot; was in place to renovate the New Building (south block) in 2021. New student facilities including a student facility hub, a faculty hub, a heritage and appreciation hub, and a learning hub are to be renovated from the current library, staff rooms and previous senior classrooms. In the long term, the New Hall block will be rebuilt, featuring a multipurpose basketball court, a swimming pool and other sports facilities. The triangular playground will have a performance hub built-in, along with a new entrance at St Joseph&#x27;s Path. A life experience hub will also be built under the atrium, providing short term accommodation for junior students. The project is expected to progress gradually, with the long term plans expected to be complete in more than 20 years time.

==Staff==
The College is governed by the School Management Committee. Members of the committee include the supervisor, the principal, three vice-principals, a teachers&#x27; representative, a Parent-Teacher Association representative, an Old Boys&#x27; Association representative and three Lasallian Brothers.

The faculty includes 67 classroom teachers, a careers mistress, a discipline mistress, a counselling mistress, a sports master, a librarian, one Native English Speaking (NET) teacher, and a French teacher. Laboratory technicians, IT technicians and a library assistant are also employed. A part-time social worker is accessible to the students. The current school supervisor is Brother Chan Jeffrey.

==Class structure and curriculum==
There are 33 classes in the school.
Form 1: 5 classes (A, B, C, D, E)
Form 2: 5 classes (A, B, C, D, E)
Form 3: 5 classes (A, B, C, D, E)
Form 4: 6 classes (A, B, D, E, F) (NSS Curriculum)
Form 5: 6 classes (A, B, D, E, F) (NSS Curriculum)
Form 6: 6 classes (A, B, D, E, F) (NSS Curriculum)

In junior secondary, the school offers languages, arts, humanities, business, technology subjects, as well as religious education and physical education.

In secondary four to six, students can choose three elective subjects from 12 offered, besides the four core subjects. In secondary four, students are required to have aesthetic education as well as religious education in secondary four to five.

As an English medium of instruction school, it adopts English as the teaching medium in most subjects except Chinese, Chinese history and putonghua. Events and activities such as the open day and the Green and White concert are also held in English.

Extra-curricular activities such as music ensembles and uniform groups are mostly held during lunchtime, after school or on Saturdays.

==Extra-curricular activities==
===Sports===
In 1877, two years after its establishment, the College held the first local inter-school sports competition with St. Paul&#x27;s College, and in 1880 it established one of the first modern football teams in China.

The first local inter-school athletic meet with Queen&#x27;s College and Diocesan Boys&#x27; School was held in 1899, and in 1903 the first local inter-school football league was formed with the two schools.

===Scouting, Red Cross and St. John Ambulance===

The College established a Scout troop in 1913, which was the first within the Catholic Church community in Hong Kong. As other Boy Scouts in Hong Kong were connected with the Protestant Boys&#x27; Brigade and British Boy Scouts, the St Joseph&#x27;s College troop registered with The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom as its first Hong Kong Boy Scout Troop, two years before The Boy Scouts Association established a branch in Hong Kong.

On 1 November 1967, an ambulance cadet division of the St. John Ambulance Brigade was established at the College and was the first ambulance cadet division after the first re-organization in the 1950s.

===Music===
Since 1974, the College has taken part in the champion title in Male Voice Quartet, Folk music, Solos and Duets, the Dorothy Smith Trophy (Boys Junior: Treble Choir), the Music Society Shield (Mixed Voice Choir), the Dr. Karl Hohner Shield (Melodica Band) and the Moutrie Challenge Trophy (Piano Solos: Final) in the Hong Kong Schools Music Festival.

The school has set up different music groups so as to enhance student&#x27;s interest in music through various performances and joint-school events. The School Orchestra was established in 2000 and has performed in different public events and concerts. In March 2013, the School Orchestra performed with Tonbridge School Orchestra from the UK during its overseas Tour to Hong Kong.

The school has established various music groups such as the Chamber Boys&#x27; Choir, Chamber Orchestra, Junior Choir, Senior Choir, Melodica Band, Symphonic Band, String Orchestra and Chinese Drum Band. Each year, the school organises the &quot;Green and White Concert&quot; in early July. The 10th G&amp;W Concert was organised at City Hall in 2012 with various special features.

===Information technology===
St Joseph&#x27;s College developed an Apache web server in the 1990s, and launched Green &amp; White Online, one of the first secondary school websites in Hong Kong.

==Motto, badge, and rally==
The school motto &quot;Labore et Virtute&quot; (Latin); &quot;勤勞與美德&quot; (Chinese); Labour and Virtue (English) — is meant to summarise the life of Saint Joseph.

The badge of the College displays a shield divided into three divisions. The top division shows the Signum Fidei (a sign of faith) - a five-pointed, radiant star, which is taken from the insignia of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. It reminds people of the spirit of faith in the Institute. The right lower division shows three chevrons symbolizing broken bones, reminding students of the bravery and zeal the Saint promoted.

The left lower division shows the book of knowledge on top (with the Alpha and Omega inscribed) and a lamp below; together they symbolise the importance of education, something which Jean-Baptiste de la Salle emphasised. The shield stands with a compartment with supporters each of the French lily, as the Lasallian family originates in Rheims, France. The top features a ribbon with the name of the College, and a crest with a cross and a crown (used to symbolise Hong Kong as a British Crown Colony before 1997). Below the shield are three shells symbolising baptism. The motto of the college is displayed at the bottom of the badge.

The combination of green and white has become the College&#x27;s official colours over the years. Green represents Ireland&#x27;s shamrock, while white represents France&#x27;s fleur-de-lis. The Lasallian Brothers of the College mostly come from Ireland and France. The school rally is based on a traditional Irish song O&#x27;Donnell Abú. Brother Marcian James Cullen (1868–1938), an Irish brother and director of St. Joseph&#x27;s College in 1921, adapted the song and wrote the lyrics for the rally. Brother Marcian James was posted to other Lasallian schools in Malaya and Singapore and brought the same song into use at a few of those schools.

<text>Moral reasoning is the study of how people think about right and wrong and how they acquire and apply moral rules. It is a subdiscipline of moral psychology that overlaps with moral philosophy, and is the foundation of descriptive ethics.

== Description ==
Starting from a young age, people can make moral decisions about what is right and wrong. Moral reasoning, however, is a part of morality that occurs both within and between individuals. Prominent contributors to this theory include Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliot Turiel. The term is sometimes used in a different sense: reasoning under conditions of uncertainty, such as those commonly obtained in a court of law. It is this sense that gave rise to the phrase, &quot;To a moral certainty;&quot; however, this idea is now seldom used outside of charges to juries.

Moral reasoning is an important and often daily process that people use when trying to do the right thing. For instance, every day people are faced with the dilemma of whether to lie in a given situation or not. People make this decision by reasoning the morality of their potential actions, and through weighing their actions against potential consequences.

A moral choice can be a personal, economic, or ethical one; as described by some ethical code, or regulated by ethical relationships with others. This branch of psychology is concerned with how these issues are perceived by ordinary people, and so is the foundation of descriptive ethics. There are many different forms of moral reasoning which often are dictated by culture. Cultural differences in the high-levels of cognitive function associated with moral reasoning can be observed through the association of brain networks from various cultures and their moral decision making. These cultural differences demonstrate the neural basis that cultural influences can have on an individual&#x27;s moral reasoning and decision making.

Distinctions between theories of moral reasoning can be accounted for by evaluating inferences (which tend to be either deductive or inductive) based on a given set of premises. Deductive inference reaches a conclusion that is true based on whether a given set of premises preceding the conclusion are also true, whereas, inductive inference goes beyond information given in a set of premises to base the conclusion on provoked reflection.

==In philosophy==
Philosopher David Hume claims that morality is based more on perceptions than on logical reasoning. This means that people&#x27;s morality is based more on their emotions and feelings than on a logical analysis of any given situation. Hume regards morals as linked to passion, love, happiness, and other emotions and therefore not based on reason. Jonathan Haidt agrees, arguing in his social intuitionist model that reasoning concerning a moral situation or idea follows an initial intuition. Haidt&#x27;s fundamental stance on moral reasoning is that &quot;moral intuitions (including moral emotions) come first and directly cause moral judgments&quot;; he characterizes moral intuition as &quot;the sudden appearance in consciousness of a moral judgment, including an affective valence (good-bad, like-dislike), without any conscious awareness of having gone through steps of searching, weighing evidence, or inferring a conclusion&quot;.

Immanuel Kant had a radically different view of morality. In his view, there are universal laws of morality that one should never break regardless of emotions. He proposes a four-step system to determine whether or not a given action was moral based on logic and reason. The first step of this method involves formulating &quot;a maxim capturing your reason for an action&quot;. In the second step, one &quot;frame[s] it as a universal principle for all rational agents&quot;. The third step is assessing &quot;whether a world based on this universal principle is conceivable&quot;. If it is, then the fourth step is asking oneself &quot;whether [one] would will the maxim to be a principle in this world&quot;. In essence, an action is moral if the maxim by which it is justified is one which could be universalized. For instance, when deciding whether or not to lie to someone for one&#x27;s own advantage, one is meant to imagine what the world would be like if everyone always lied, and successfully so. In such a world, there would be no purpose in lying, for everybody would expect deceit, rendering the universal maxim of lying whenever it is to your advantage absurd. Thus, Kant argues that one should not lie under any circumstance. Another example would be if trying to decide whether suicide is moral or immoral; imagine if everyone committed suicide. Since mass international suicide would not be a good thing, the act of suicide is immoral. Kant&#x27;s moral framework, however, operates under the overarching maxim that you should treat each person as an end in themselves, not as a means to an end. This overarching maxim must be considered when applying the four aforementioned steps.

Reasoning based on analogy is one form of moral reasoning. When using this form of moral reasoning the morality of one situation can be applied to another based on whether this situation is relevantly similar: similar enough that the same moral reasoning applies. A similar type of reasoning is used in common law when arguing based upon legal precedent. 

In consequentialism (often distinguished from deontology) actions are based as right on wrong based upon the consequences of action as opposed to a property intrinsic to the action itself.

== In developmental psychology ==
Moral reasoning first attracted a broad attention from developmental psychologists in the mid-to-late 20th century. Their main theorization involved elucidating the stages of development of moral reasoning capacity.

===Jean Piaget===
Jean Piaget developed two phases of moral development, one common among children and the other common among adults. The first is known as the Heteronomous Phase. This phase, more common among children, is characterized by the idea that rules come from authority figures in one&#x27;s life such as parents, teachers, and God. It also involves the idea that rules are permanent no matter what. Thirdly, this phase of moral development includes the belief that &quot;naughty&quot; behavior must always be punished and that the punishment will be proportional.

The second phase in Piaget&#x27;s theory of moral development is referred to as the Autonomous Phase. This phase is more common after one has matured and is no longer a child. In this phase people begin to view the intentions behind actions as more important than their consequences. For instance, if a person who is driving swerves in order to not hit a dog and then knocks over a road sign, adults are likely to be less angry at the person than if he or she had done it on purpose just for fun. Even though the outcome is the same, people are more forgiving because of the good intention of saving the dog. This phase also includes the idea that people have different morals and that morality is not necessarily universal. People in the Autonomous Phase also believe rules may be broken under certain circumstances. For instance, Rosa Parks broke the law by refusing to give up her seat on a bus, which was against the law but something many people consider moral nonetheless. In this phase people also stop believing in the idea of immanent justice.

===Lawrence Kohlberg===

Inspired by Piaget, Lawrence Kohlberg made significant contributions to the field of moral reasoning by creating a theory of moral development. His theory is a &quot;widely accepted theory that provides the basis for empirical evidence on the influence of human decision making on ethical behavior.&quot; In Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s view, moral development consists of the growth of less egocentric and more impartial modes of reasoning on more complicated matters. He believed that the objective of moral education is the reinforcement of children to grow from one stage to an upper stage. Dilemma was a critical tool that he emphasized that children should be presented with; yet also, the knowledge for children to cooperate. According to his theory, people pass through three main stages of moral development as they grow from early childhood to adulthood. These are pre-conventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality. Each of these is subdivided into two levels.

The stages that are presented by Lawrence Kohlberg can be varied into three which are pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional where each contains two stages varying in ages. The first stage in the pre-conventional level is obedience and punishment. In this stage people, usually young children where they age from 5 to 7 years old, avoid certain behaviors only because of the fear of punishment, not because they see them as wrong. They believe that the rules are mandatory, and they like avoiding harms. The second stage in the pre-conventional level is called individualism and exchange: in this stage people make moral decisions based on what best serves their needs. It happens usually during ages of 8 to 10 years old where they have some understandings that some rules are arbitrary but not consistent.

The third stage is part of the conventional morality level and is called interpersonal relationships. This stage ages from 10 to 12 years old where they concern about living up to expectations and reciprocity. For example, their actings are mostly motivated by their parent&#x27;s praises or reactions. In this stage one tries to conform to what is considered moral by the society that they live in, attempting to be seen by peers as a good person. The fourth stage is also in the conventional morality level and is called maintaining social order. Kids around this stage age between 12 and 14 where they believe conventions are arbitrary social expectations. Also, they believe moral decisions are based on fairness not rules. This stage focuses on a view of society as a whole and following the laws and rules of that society.

The fifth stage is a part of the post-conventional level and is called social contract and individual rights. People in this age vary from 17 to 20 which not much people are in it. They believe morality is relative to systems of laws, and they don&#x27;t think any system is necessarily superior. In this stage people begin to consider differing ideas about morality in other people and feel that rules and laws should be agreed on by the members of a society. The sixth and final stage of moral development, the second in the post-conventional level, is called universal principles. They usually age between 21 or older where they think what is moral are values and rights that exist prior to social attachment and contracts. At this stage people begin to develop their ideas of universal moral principles and will consider them the right thing to do regardless of what the laws of a society are.

===James Rest===

In 1983, James Rest developed the four component Model of Morality, which addresses the ways that moral motivation and behavior occurs. The first of these is moral sensitivity, which is &quot;the ability to see an ethical dilemma, including how our actions will affect others&quot;. The second is moral judgment, which is &quot;the ability to reason correctly about what &#x27;ought&#x27; to be done in a specific situation&quot;. The third is moral motivation, which is &quot;a personal commitment to moral action, accepting responsibility for the outcome&quot;. The fourth and final component of moral behavior is moral character, which is a &quot;courageous persistence in spite of fatigue or temptations to take the easy way out&quot;.

== In social cognition ==
Based on empirical results from behavioral and neuroscientific studies, social and cognitive psychologists attempted to develop a more accurate descriptive (rather than normative) theory of moral reasoning. That is, the emphasis of research was on how real-world individuals made moral judgments, inferences, decisions, and actions, rather than what should be considered as moral.

=== Dual-process theory and social intuitionism ===

Developmental theories of moral reasoning were critiqued as prioritizing on the maturation of cognitive aspect of moral reasoning. From Kohlberg&#x27;s perspective, one is considered as more advanced in moral reasoning as she is more efficient in using deductive reasoning and abstract moral principles to make moral judgments about particular instances. For instance, an advanced reasoner may reason syllogistically with the Kantian principle of &#x27;treat individuals as ends and never merely as means&#x27; and a situation where kidnappers are demanding a ransom for a hostage, to conclude that the kidnappers have violated a moral principle and should be condemned. In this process, reasoners are assumed to be rational and have conscious control over how they arrive at judgments and decisions.

In contrast with such view, however, Joshua Greene and colleagues argued that laypeople&#x27;s moral judgments are significantly influenced, if not shaped, by intuition and emotion as opposed to rational application of rules. In their fMRI studies in the early 2000s, participants were shown three types of decision scenarios: one type included moral dilemmas that elicited emotional reaction (moral-personal condition), the second type included moral dilemmas that did not elicit emotional reaction (moral-impersonal condition), and the third type had no moral content (non-moral condition). Brain regions such as posterior cingulate gyrus and angular gyrus, whose activation is known to correlate with experience of emotion, showed activations in moral-personal condition but not in moral-impersonal condition. Meanwhile, regions known to correlate with working memory, including right middle frontal gyrus and bilateral parietal lobe, were less active in moral-personal condition than in moral-impersonal condition. Moreover, participants&#x27; neural activity in response to moral-impersonal scenarios was similar to their activity in response to non-moral decision scenarios.

Another study used variants of trolley problem that differed in the &#x27;personal/impersonal&#x27; dimension and surveyed people&#x27;s permissibility judgment (Scenarios 1 and 2). Across scenarios, participants were presented with the option of sacrificing a person to save five people. However, depending on the scenario, the sacrifice involved pushing a person off a footbridge to block the trolley (footbridge dilemma condition; personal) or simply throwing a switch to redirect the trolley (trolley dilemma condition; impersonal). The proportions of participants who judged the sacrifice as permissible differed drastically: 11% (footbridge dilemma) vs. 89% (trolley dilemma). This difference was attributed to the emotional reaction evoked from having to apply personal force on the victim, rather than simply throwing a switch without physical contact with the victim. Focusing on participants who judged the sacrifice in trolley dilemma as permissible but the sacrifice in footbridge dilemma as impermissible, the majority of them failed to provide a plausible justification for their differing judgments. Several philosophers have written critical responses on this matter to Joshua Greene and colleagues.

Based on these results, social psychologists proposed the dual process theory of morality. They suggested that our emotional intuition and deliberate reasoning are not only qualitatively distinctive, but they also compete in making moral judgments and decisions. When making an emotionally-salient moral judgment, automatic, unconscious, and immediate response is produced by our intuition first. More careful, deliberate, and formal reasoning then follows to produce a response that is either consistent or inconsistent with the earlier response produced by intuition, in parallel with more general form of dual process theory of thinking. But in contrast with the previous rational view on moral reasoning, the dominance of the emotional process over the rational process was proposed. Haidt highlighted the aspect of morality not directly accessible by our conscious search in memory, weighing of evidence, or inference. He describes moral judgment as akin to aesthetic judgment, where an instant approval or disapproval of an event or object is produced upon perception. Hence, once produced, the immediate intuitive response toward a situation or person cannot easily be overridden by the rational consideration that follows. The theory explained that in many cases, people resolve inconsistency between the intuitive and rational processes by using the latter for post-hoc justification of the former. Haidt, using the metaphor &quot;the emotional dog and its rational tail&quot;, applied such nature of our reasoning to the contexts ranging from person perception to politics.

A notable illustration of the influence of intuition involved feeling of disgust. According to Haidt&#x27;s moral foundations theory, political liberals rely on two dimensions (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity) of evaluation to make moral judgments, but conservatives utilize three additional dimensions (ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity). Among these, studies have revealed the link between moral evaluations based on purity/sanctity dimension and reasoner&#x27;s experience of disgust. That is, people with higher sensitivity to disgust were more likely to be conservative toward political issues such as gay marriage and abortion. Moreover, when the researchers reminded participants of keeping the lab clean and washing their hands with antiseptics (thereby priming the purity/sanctity dimension), participants&#x27; attitudes were more conservative than in the control condition. In turn, Helzer and Pizarro&#x27;s findings have been rebutted by two failed attempts of replications.

Other studies raised criticism toward Haidt&#x27;s interpretation of his data. Augusto Blasi also rebuts the theories of Jonathan Haidt on moral intuition and reasoning. He agrees with Haidt that moral intuition plays a significant role in the way humans operate. However, Blasi suggests that people use moral reasoning more than Haidt and other cognitive scientists claim. Blasi advocates moral reasoning and reflection as the foundation of moral functioning. Reasoning and reflection play a key role in the growth of an individual and the progress of societies.

Alternatives to these dual-process/intuitionist models have been proposed, with several theorists proposing that moral judgment and moral reasoning involves domain general cognitive processes, e.g., mental models, social learning or categorization processes.

=== Motivated reasoning ===

A theorization of moral reasoning similar to dual-process theory was put forward with emphasis on our motivations to arrive at certain conclusions. Ditto and colleagues likened moral reasoners in everyday situations to lay attorneys than lay judges; people do not reason in the direction from assessment of individual evidence to moral conclusion (bottom-up), but from a preferred moral conclusion to assessment of evidence (top-down). The former resembles the thought process of a judge who is motivated to be accurate, unbiased, and impartial in her decisions; the latter resembles that of an attorney whose goal is to win a dispute using partial and selective arguments.

Kunda proposed motivated reasoning as a general framework for understanding human reasoning. She emphasized the broad influence of physiological arousal, affect, and preference (which constitute the essence of motivation and cherished beliefs) on our general cognitive processes including memory search and belief construction. Importantly, biases in memory search, hypothesis formation and evaluation result in confirmation bias, making it difficult for reasoners to critically assess their beliefs and conclusions. It is reasonable to state that individuals and groups will manipulate and confuse reasoning for belief depending on the lack of self control to allow for their confirmation bias to be the driving force of their reasoning. This tactic is used by media, government, extremist groups, cults, etc. Those with a hold on information may dull out certain variables that propagate their agenda and then leave out specific context to push an opinion into the form of something reasonable to control individual, groups, and entire populations. This allows the use of alternative specific context with fringe content to further veer from any form of dependability in their reasoning. Leaving a fictional narrative in the place of real evidence for a logical outlook to form a proper, honest, and logical assessment .

Applied to moral domain, our strong motivation to favor people we like leads us to recollect beliefs and interpret facts in ways that favor them. In Alicke (1992, Study 1), participants made responsibility judgments about an agent who drove over the speed limit and caused an accident. When the motive for speeding was described as moral (to hide a gift for his parents&#x27; anniversary), participants assigned less responsibility to the agent than when the motive was immoral (to hide a vial of cocaine). Even though the causal attribution of the accident may technically fall under the domain of objective, factual understanding of the event, it was nevertheless significantly affected by the perceived intention of the agent (which was presumed to have determined the participants&#x27; motivation to praise or blame him).

Another paper by Simon, Stenstrom, and Read (2015, Studies 3 and 4) used a more comprehensive paradigm that measures various aspects of participants&#x27; interpretation of a moral event, including factual inferences, emotional attitude toward agents, and motivations toward the outcome of decision. Participants read about a case involving a purported academic misconduct and were asked to role-play as a judicial officer who must provide a verdict. A student named Debbie had been accused of cheating in an exam, but the overall situation of the incident was kept ambiguous to allow participants to reason in a desired direction. Then, the researchers attempted to manipulate participants&#x27; motivation to support either the university (conclude that she cheated) or Debbie (she did not cheat) in the case. In one condition, the scenario stressed that through previous incidents of cheating, the efforts of honest students have not been honored and the reputation of the university suffered (Study 4, Pro-University condition); in another condition, the scenario stated that Debbie&#x27;s brother died from a tragic accident a few months ago, eliciting participants&#x27; motivation to support and sympathize with Debbie (Study 3, Pro-Debbie condition). Behavioral and computer simulation results showed an overall shift in reasoning—factual inference, emotional attitude, and moral decision—depending on the manipulated motivation. That is, when the motivation to favor the university/Debbie was elicited, participants&#x27; holistic understanding and interpretation of the incident shifted in the way that favored the university/Debbie. In these reasoning processes, situational ambiguity was shown to be critical for reasoners to arrive at their preferred conclusion.

From a broader perspective, Holyoak and Powell interpreted motivated reasoning in the moral domain as a special pattern of reasoning predicted by coherence-based reasoning framework. This general framework of cognition, initially theorized by the philosopher Paul Thagard, argues that many complex, higher-order cognitive functions are made possible by computing the coherence (or satisfying the constraints) between psychological representations such as concepts, beliefs, and emotions. Coherence-based reasoning framework draws symmetrical links between consistent (things that co-occur) and inconsistent (things that do not co-occur) psychological representations and use them as constraints, thereby providing a natural way to represent conflicts between irreconcilable motivations, observations, behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes, as well as moral obligations. Importantly, Thagard&#x27;s framework was highly comprehensive in that it provided a computational basis for modeling reasoning processes using moral and non-moral facts and beliefs as well as variables related to both &#x27;hot&#x27; and &#x27;cold&#x27; cognitions.

=== Causality and intentionality ===
Classical theories of social perception had been offered by psychologists including Fritz Heider (model of intentional action) and Harold Kelley (attribution theory). These theories highlighted how laypeople understand another person&#x27;s action based on their causal knowledge of internal (intention and ability of actor) and external (environment) factors surrounding that action. That is, people assume a causal relationship between an actor&#x27;s disposition or mental states (personality, intention, desire, belief, ability; internal cause), environment (external cause), and the resulting action (effect). In later studies, psychologists discovered that moral judgment toward an action or actor is critically linked with these causal understanding and knowledge about the mental state of the actor.

Bertram Malle and Joshua Knobe conducted survey studies to investigate laypeople&#x27;s understanding and use (the folk concept) of the word &#x27;intentionality&#x27; and its relation to action. His data suggested that people think of intentionality of an action in terms of several psychological constituents: desire for outcome, belief about the expected outcome, intention to act (combination of desire and belief), skill to bring about the outcome, and awareness of action while performing that action. Consistent with this view as well as with our moral intuitions, studies found significant effects of the agent&#x27;s intention, desire, and beliefs on various types of moral judgments, Using factorial designs to manipulate the content in the scenarios, Cushman showed that the agent&#x27;s belief and desire regarding a harmful action significantly influenced judgments of wrongness, permissibility, punishment, and blame. However, whether the action actually brought about negative consequence or not only affected blame and punishment judgments, but not wrongness and permissibility judgments. Another study also provided neuroscientific evidence for the interplay between theory of mind and moral judgment.

Through another set of studies, Knobe showed a significant effect in the opposite direction: Intentionality judgments are significantly affected by the reasoner&#x27;s moral evaluation of the actor and action. In one of his scenarios, a CEO of a corporation hears about a new programme designed to increase profit. However, the program is also expected to benefit or harm the environment as a side effect, to which he responds by saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t care&#x27;. The side effect was judged as intentional by the majority of participants in the harm condition, but the response pattern was reversed in the benefit condition.

Many studies on moral reasoning have used fictitious scenarios involving anonymous strangers (e.g., trolley problem) so that external factors irrelevant to researcher&#x27;s hypothesis can be ruled out. However, criticisms have been raised about the external validity of the experiments in which the reasoners (participants) and the agent (target of judgment) are not associated in any way. As opposed to the previous emphasis on evaluation of acts, Pizarro and Tannenbaum stressed our inherent motivation to evaluate the moral characters of agents (e.g., whether an actor is good or bad), citing the Aristotelian virtue ethics. According to their view, learning the moral character of agents around us must have been a primary concern for primates and humans beginning from their early stages of evolution, because the ability to decide whom to cooperate with in a group was crucial to survival. Furthermore, observed acts are no longer interpreted separately from the context, as reasoners are now viewed as simultaneously engaging in two tasks: evaluation (inference) of moral character of agent and evaluation of her moral act. The person-centered approach to moral judgment seems to be consistent with results from some of the previous studies that involved implicit character judgment. For instance, in Alicke&#x27;s (1992) study, participants may have immediately judged the moral character of the driver who sped home to hide cocaine as negative, and such inference led the participants to assess the causality surrounding the incident in a nuanced way (e.g., a person as immoral as him could have been speeding as well).

In order to account for laypeople&#x27;s understanding and use of causal relations between psychological variables, Sloman, Fernbach, and Ewing proposed a causal model of intentionality judgment based on Bayesian network. Their model formally postulates that character of agent is a cause for the agent&#x27;s desire for outcome and belief that action will result in consequence, desire and belief are causes for intention toward action, and the agent&#x27;s action is caused by both that intention and the skill to produce consequence. Combining computational modeling with the ideas from theory of mind research, this model can provide predictions for inferences in bottom-up direction (from action to intentionality, desire, and character) as well as in top-down direction (from character, desire, and intentionality to action).

== Gender difference ==
At one time psychologists believed that men and women have different moral values and reasoning. This was based on the idea that men and women often think differently and would react to moral dilemmas in different ways. Some researchers hypothesized that women would favor care reasoning, meaning that they would consider issues of need and sacrifice, while men would be more inclined to favor fairness and rights, which is known as justice reasoning. However, some also knew that men and women simply face different moral dilemmas on a day-to-day basis and that might be the reason for the perceived difference in their moral reasoning. With these two ideas in mind, researchers decided to do their experiments based on moral dilemmas that both men and women face regularly. To reduce situational differences and discern how both genders use reason in their moral judgments, they therefore ran the tests on parenting situations, since both genders can be involved in child rearing. The research showed that women and men use the same form of moral reasoning as one another and the only difference is the moral dilemmas they find themselves in on a day-to-day basis. When it came to moral decisions both men and women would be faced with, they often chose the same solution as being the moral choice. At least this research shows that a division in terms of morality does not actually exist, and that reasoning between genders is the same in moral decisions.

<doc id="397692" wikidata="Q3091208" url="?curid=397692" title="Helaman">
<text>The Book of Mormon mentions three men named Helaman ( ). The first was the son of King Benjamin, king of the united Nephite-Zarahemla kingdom who lived in the 2nd century BC. Besides his genealogy, information about the first Helaman is limited. His brother, Mosiah, became heir to the throne.

The second was a Nephite prophet and military leader who lived around the 1st century BC. He was the grandson of Alma and the oldest son of Alma (the younger), and was entrusted with maintaining a record of their people, the Nephites, as found in the Book of Alma. According to the Book of Mormon, he led into battle an army of two thousand young male warriors, which he referred to as his two thousand sons (two thousand stripling warriors). Most of the parts of the narrative involving Helaman come from the latter half of the Book of Alma.

The third Helaman was the son of the above mentioned Helaman. He was a chief judge over the Nephites and was also responsible for maintaining a record of this people. The account that Helaman kept was recorded on the same records as his father. This record, however, was first given by Helaman (the father) to his brother Shiblon, who then handed the record down to his nephew, Helaman. The writings of this second Helaman are contained within the Book of Helaman.

==Etymology==
Joseph Smith had no knowledge of any foreign language at the time of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s composition, and the name &quot;Helaman&quot; has never been discovered in any non-Mormon text. However, Brigham Young University&#x27;s &quot;Book of Mormon Onomasticon&quot; includes several apologetic etymologies for the name, including &quot;Hammer of God&quot;.

==Early life==
Helaman was the eldest son of Alma the Younger, another Nephite prophet. The exact time and place of his birth are unknown. The house of his father, Alma, was in Zarahemla, the Nephite capital land, and Helaman may also have lived in Zarahemla.

The Book of Mormon first mentions Helaman in Alma 31:7, and little is known of his life prior to this brief allusion. In this verse Helaman&#x27;s father, Alma, and two younger brothers, Shiblon and Corianton, embark on a missionary journey to the Zoramites, but Helaman does not accompany them. This journey occurred towards the end of the 17th year of the &quot;reign of the judges&quot;, which probably corresponds to about 75 BC.

==Later life==
After their missionary labors among the Zoramites, Alma, his sons, and the rest of their company returned to Zarahemla. At this time Alma gathered his sons together to give each of them a charge. In his charge to Helaman, Alma recounts his own conversion, exhorts Helaman to righteousness, and confers stewardship of the sacred records and other artifacts (including the &quot;interpreters&quot;, or Urim and Thummim). to Helaman. These sacred records were passed down from generation to generation throughout the history of the Nephites, with each generation adding the story of their own time. It was these records which Mormon and Moroni drew from and abridged when compiling the Book of Mormon. Helaman accepted the records and continued the record-keeping tradition. The section of the Book of Alma beginning at chapter 45 states that it is, &quot;The account of the people of Nephi, and their wars and dissensions, in the days of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman, which he kept in his days.&quot; This section may possibly continue as far as chapter 62, wherein Helaman dies.

Following Alma&#x27;s words to his sons, he and his sons (including, presumably, Helaman) went among the people for a time, preaching the word of God. Shortly afterward, in the 19th year of the reign of the judges (c. 73 BC), Alma approached Helaman for an important conversation. In what some consider a good model for child-parent interviews, Alma questioned Helaman, praised him for his beliefs, and blessed him. Alma also dictated to him a prophecy of the destruction of the Nephites, which Alma commanded him to record but not to make known until it was fulfilled. Not long after his charge to Helaman, Alma departed and was never heard of again.

After this, Helaman and his brethren went among the people declaring the word of God and appointing &quot;priests and teachers throughout all the land, over all the churches.&quot; Dissension arose, allegedly due to the people&#x27;s pride and riches, and the people thus would not heed the words of Helaman and his brethren.

For the next several years, Helaman worked as a high priest in the Church, though not necessarily as &quot;the&quot; high priest over the Church. Helaman&#x27;s work suffered major set-backs during Amalickiah&#x27;s rise, but then prospered in the years following Amalickiah&#x27;s departure from the Nephites to the Lamanites.

==Ministering to the Anti-Nephi-Lehies==
Helaman next appears in Alma 53, in the 26th year of the reign of the judges (c. 66 BC), trying to persuade the Anti-Nephi-Lehies, also known as Ammonites, not to take up arms. Years earlier, upon their conversion to the gospel of Christ, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies had made an oath to God that they &quot;never would use weapons again for the shedding of man&#x27;s blood.&quot; The Nephites and the Lamanites were embroiled in war, and the Anti-Nephi-Lehies wished to join the conflict and fight alongside the Nephites. However, to do so would mean breaking the oath which they had made. Helaman &quot;feared lest by so doing they should lose their souls.&quot; Overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies resigned themselves to being spectators in the conflict.

However, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies had many sons who, unlike their fathers, had never entered into a covenant not to take up weapons of war. These sons also wished to fight for the Nephites and have Helaman as their leader. With no oath restricting them and the Nephites in desperate circumstances, they were permitted to do so. There is no indication prior to this in the text that Helaman had any military training whatsoever, and indeed he may not have. Certainly, the sons of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies had no fighting experience. Regardless, the interesting turn of events made Helaman have the Anti-Nephi-Lehies marching at the head of an army of two thousand soldiers. LDS leader Richard J. Maynes cited the entire episode in a General Conference as containing good examples of covenant-keeping behavior.

==Commander of the Stripling Warriors==

Helaman&#x27;s army of two thousand young men is often referred to as the two thousand stripling warriors, or the sons of Helaman. Theirs is one of the most well-known stories from the Book of Mormon.

In brief, Helaman and his band marched in the 26th year of the reign of the judges (c. 66 BC) to the western part of the land of the Nephites and there joined the existing Nephite forces. There they played a pivotal role in some crucial Nephite victories. As a result of those victories, the Nephites regained possession of all of the western cities which had been taken by the Lamanites. Although two of their battles were very bloody, the army of Helaman did not incur a single fatality. Helaman attributed this to divine preservation.

Helaman wrote an epistle to the captain of the Nephite armies, Moroni, informing him of their success and expressing confusion that the government did not send more troops and support to the western front. Moroni received the epistle in the 30th year of the reign of the judges (c. 62 BC). The next year the Nephites successfully drove the Lamanites back into the land southward and thus the war ended at last.

==Last years==
After the war ended in the 31st year of the reign of the judges (c. 61 BC), Helaman first briefly &quot;returned to the place of his inheritance&quot;. He then went forth with his brethren, preaching the word of God and establishing the Church. About four years later, in the 35th year of the reign of the judges (c. 57 BC), Helaman died. At the time of his death, Helaman had not yet formally conferred stewardship of the sacred records and artifacts to his son, Helaman, as would have been traditional. Instead Shiblon &quot;took possession of those sacred things&quot; following Helaman&#x27;s death.

<doc id="397701" wikidata="Q1153029" url="?curid=397701" title="Russian cruiser Varyag (1899)">
<text>Varyag () sometimes also spelled Variag, was a Russian protected cruiser. &quot;Varyag&quot; became famous for her crew&#x27;s stoicism at the Battle of Chemulpo Bay. She was acquired as a prize of war during the Russo-Japanese War by the Imperial Japanese Navy, who renamed her Soya and was later returned to the Russian Imperial Navy during World War I.

==Construction and design==
In 1897, the Russian Admiralty, as part of a program to reinforce the Imperial Russian Navy&#x27;s Far East Fleet, published specifications for a fast protected cruiser, capable of commerce raiding. The ships were required to be armed with 152 mm (6-inch) quick-firing guns, and to have a speed of . Russian shipyards were already busy, and the Imperial Admiralty placed an order with the American shipyard William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia on 11 April 1898 to build a single cruiser, &quot;Varyag&quot; against this specification. Single ships were also ordered from the German shipyards Germaniawerft () and AG Vulcan () against these specifications. &quot;Varyag&quot; was laid down in October 1898, was launched on 31 October 1899 and commissioned into the Imperial Russian Navy on 2 January 1901 O.S. (14 January 1901 N.S.), under the command of Captain Vladimir Behr.

&quot;Varyag&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of at normal displacement. Design displacement was with full load displacement about . Thirty Niclausse water-tube boilers fed steam to two sets of four-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines rated at which drove two 3-bladed propellers.
As a protected cruiser, the main protection consisted of an arched armoured deck which protected the ship&#x27;s engines and magazines. The deck was thick in the central horizontal portion, and thick in the sloping sections towards the ship&#x27;s sides. The ship&#x27;s conning tower was protected by , with protecting the ammunition hoists and for the bow and stern torpedo tubes. The ship&#x27;s main armament was twelve Obukhoff 152 mm (6-inch) L/45 guns, with two guns side by side on the ship&#x27;s forecastle, two side-by-side on the quarterdeck, and the remaining eight on sponsons on the ship&#x27;s upper deck. These guns could fire a shell to a range of , and at a rate of 6 rounds per minute. 2388 rounds of 152 mm ammunition were carried. Twelve 75 mm (2.95 in) L/50 QF guns defended the ship against torpedo boats, and could fire a shell to a range of at a rate of 10 rounds per minute. Close-in defence was provided by four Hotchkiss 47 mm revolving cannon on fighting tops, with four more on the upper deck, backed up by two 37 mm guns and two machine guns. Two Baranowski 64 mm landing guns were also carried for on-shore use by the ship&#x27;s marines. Six 381 mm (15 inch) torpedo tubes were carried, two on each broadside and one in the bow and stern.

During her construction, an assistant physician, Leo Alexandroff, left the ship&#x27;s advance party on 20 April 1899, and applied for U.S. citizenship. He was arrested for desertion. His case reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in &quot;Tucker v. Alexandroff&quot; that the ship, though not accepted for service in the Imperial Russian Navy, was a warship under the terms of the 1832 treaty between Russia and the United States; thus Alexandroff would be returned to Russian authorities.

==First Russian service==

At the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, under the command of Captain Vsevolod Rudnev, &quot;Varyag&quot; was stationed at Chemulpo Bay with the aging gunboat . On 8 February, a large Japanese force under Admiral Uriu blockaded the Russian in the harbor. As Chemulpo was in neutral Korean waters, Admiral Uriu gave the Russian ships a written ultimatum to sail by 12:00 noon or be attacked in the harbor itself. Captain Rudnev attempted to fight his way out, but after sustaining heavy casualties (31 men dead, 191 injured out of 570) and outgunned, both ships returned to harbor by 1:00 p.m., the crew decided to scuttle both ships. The crew was saved by transferring them to the British cruiser , the , and the ; the captain of the US gunboat declined doing so as a violation of U.S. neutrality.

In 1907, Vsevolod Rudnev (by that time dismissed from Russian naval service in the rank of rear admiral) was decorated with the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun for his heroism in that battle; although he accepted the order, he never wore it in public.

== Japanese cruiser &quot;Soya&quot; ==
After the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese raised the badly damaged wreck from Chemulpo harbor, repaired it, and commissioned it into the Imperial Japanese Navy as the cruiser &quot;Soya&quot; on 9 July 1907. Its new name was taken from the northernmost cape of Hokkaidō, Soya Misaki. 

After being placed into Japanese service as a cruiser, &quot;Soya&quot; was used primarily for training duties. From 14 March 1909 to 7 August 1909, it made a long distance navigational and officer cadet training cruise to Hawaii and North America. It repeated this training cruise every year until 1913.

== Return to Russia ==
During World War I, Russia and Japan were allies and several ships were transferred by the Japanese to the Russians. Along with and , she was repurchased by the Imperial Russian Navy at Vladivostok on 5 April 1916 and renamed &quot;Varyag&quot;. In June, she departed for Murmansk via the Indian Ocean, arriving in November 1916. She was sent to Liverpool in Great Britain for an overhaul by Cammell Laird in February 1917, and was due to re-enter service with the Arctic Ocean Flotilla of the Imperial Russian Navy. However, following the Russian October Revolution on 7 November 1917, crewmen who had remained onboard hoisted the red flag and refused to set sail. On 8 December 1917 she was seized by a detachment of British soldiers. Assigned to the Royal Navy in February 1918, she ran aground while under tow off of Ireland, but was refloated and used as a hulk until 1919. She was then sold to a German firm in 1920 for scrap, but on 5 February 1920 ran aground on rocks near the Scottish village of Lendalfoot () in the Firth of Clyde, while being towed to Germany. She was scrapped in place from 1923 to 1925.

==Legacy==

The stoicism of &quot;Varyag&quot;″s crew at Chemulpo has inspired the Austrian poet Rudolf Greinz to write a poem dedicated to Varyag. The Russian translation of this poem was put to music by A.S. Turischev. The result was the 1904 song that remains popular today:
(German original)
Auf Deck, Kameraden, all&#x27; auf Deck!
Heraus zur letzten Parade!
Der stolze Warjag ergibt sich nicht,
Wir brauchen keine Gnade!

(Russian poetic translation)
Наверх вы, товарищи, все по местам!
Последний парад наступает.
Врагу не сдается наш гордый “Варяг”,
Пощады никто не желает. 

&quot;(translation)&quot;
Get up, you comrades, everyone to his place,
The final parade is at hand.
Our proud &quot;Varyag&quot; will not surrender to the enemy,
No one wants mercy.
Rudolf Greinz

On 30 July 2006 (Russian Navy Day), a memorial plaque to the cruiser was unveiled at Lendalfoot in a ceremony attended by senior Russian politicians and navy personnel, veterans and local dignitaries.

On 8 September 2007 a monument in the form of a large bronze cross was unveiled as an addition to the Lendalfoot memorial, in a ceremony attended by former Nato Secretary General George Robertson, British and Russian navy officers and diplomats. The &quot;Cruiser Varyag&quot; Charity Foundation had organised a competition in Russia for the design of the monument.

In 2010, as a gesture marking the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Korea and Russia, the flag of &quot;Varyag&quot; was restored. The Japanese Navy recovered the flag when the ship was salvaged; and the Incheon Metropolitan Museum acquired them after Japan&#x27;s defeat at the end of World War II. The return of the flag takes the form of a two-year renewable loan because of the Korean law protecting cultural assets.

<text>The Berlin Air Safety Centre (BASC) was established by the Allied Control Council&#x27;s Coordinating Committee on 12 December 1945. It was located in the former Kammergericht Building, on Kleistpark, Berlin. Operations began in February 1946 under quadripartite flight rules Paragraph 4. Paragraph 4 of the rules begins: &quot;The Berlin Air Safety Centre has been established in the Allied Control Authority Building with the object of ensuring safety of flights for all aircraft in the Berlin area. BASC regulates all flying in the Berlin control zone and also in the corridors extending from Berlin to the boundaries of adjacent control zones.&quot;
The BASC was one of two Four-Power Authorities to continue functioning following the onset of the Cold War, the other being Spandau Prison, which ceased operations following the death of Rudolf Hess on 17 August 1987. The BASC continued to ensure safety of flight, for 24 hours a day, with the three western powers being represented by a chief controller, along with a deputy and general duty controller; all were Air Force officers. The Soviets, in attempt to mitigate being out numbered, had both a controller and interpreter on duty until its closing on 31 December 1990, following the lapse of Allied responsibilities in Berlin.
The BASC coordinated air traffic in and out of Berlin and was responsible for air safety in the three corridors established in 1946 as well as in the Berlin control zone, the airspace within a radius of a pillar located in the cellar of the Allied Control Authority building. Each of the three corridors were wide and linked Berlin with the Western Zones of Occupation of Germany (later West Germany).

The three corridors were usually open, without restriction, only to the Four Power nations: United Kingdom, United States, France and USSR – other nations wishing to use the corridors had first to request and obtain permission from the BASC. Requests to use the southern corridor were handled by the US desk, the centre corridor by the French desk, and the northern corridor by the UK desk. The requests were then handed to the USSR desk for coordination, with Soviet air defense authorities, and in turn would be stamped in one of three ways: &quot;permission granted, safety of flight guaranteed&quot;; &quot;permission granted, safety of flight not guaranteed&quot;; or &quot;permission denied&quot;.
Coordinating closely with the Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Centre (BARTCC) facilities at Tempelhof Air Base, BASC personnel were responsible for logging protests of infringements upon Allied air corridors, and fielded the political ramifications of Eastern Bloc defectors escaping into West Berlin by aircraft. Tensions reached an understandable high during the Berlin Airlift in 1948–49, during which many fights broke out among controllers, though the success of the campaign was in large part due to the coordination carried out within the BASC.

<doc id="397704" wikidata="Q898201" url="?curid=397704" title="Silver Samurai">
<text>Silver Samurai is the name of two different supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, both acquaintances of Wolverine.

The character has appeared in several X-Men-related animated series and video games before making its live-action debut in the 2013 film &quot;The Wolverine&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Kenuichio Harada===

Kenuichio Harada is the original Silver Samurai. The character first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #111 (July 1974), and was created by writer Steve Gerber and artist Bob Brown. A Japanese mutant who uses his powers to charge his katana and wears a samurai-style armor made of a silvery metal, he is the illegitimate son of Lord Shingen, the half-brother of Mariko Yashida, a cousin of Sunfire and Sunpyre, and a nemesis of Wolverine. While he spent most of his existence as a villain, he eventually reformed into a more heroic figure.

===Shin Harada===
Shingen &quot;Shin&quot; Harada, otherwise known as the second Silver Samurai, is Kenuichio Harada&#x27;s son who is named after Lord Shingen. He had been committing larceny with Amiko Kobayashi. Shin later worked with Mystique to track down newly awakened mutants to join a cause. He was later recruited by Kade Killgore to be a teacher at the Hellfire Club&#x27;s Hellfire Academy where he worked as a designer. Silver Samurai later appeared as a member of Mystique&#x27;s fourth incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants. During Magneto&#x27;s fight with the Brotherhood of Mutants on Madripoor, Magneto controlled Silver Samurai into wounding Mystique.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Shingen Harada represented the Yashida Corporation when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of Alchemax, Wilson Fisk of Fisk Industries, Sebastian Shaw of Shaw Industries, Darren Cross of Cross Technological Enterprises, Zeke Stane of Stane International, Frr&#x27;dox of Shi&#x27;ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed with Dario Agger about Roxxon Energy Corporation&#x27;s plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. When the true motive of the meeting was revealed, Harada attacked Dario and they almost fought, interrupted by the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation, resulting in Dario getting knocked out when declaring herself a new member of their assembly. He then went to an underwater station in the Southern Ocean, where he attacked the employees until encountering Thor who defeated him by smacking him repeatedly with Mjolnir. He then escaped and joined Exterminatrix in an aerial battle against soldiers attempting to rescue Dario. They later entered Roxxon Corporation HQ, where they encountered the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.S., a group of Hulk-like superhumans. While the Mindless Ones fought the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.S., Silver Samurai and Exterminatrix went to Dario&#x27;s vault, attempting to take the money until Agent Solomon arrived, forcing Exterminatrix to fight the woman while Silver Samurai opened the vault. When the vault was opened, Dario transformed into Minotaur and knocked out Silver Samurai. Then, the floating island the building was located on fell down due to the activation of the Agger Imperative. While S.H.I.E.L.D. evacuated the building, Thor destroyed the island. The villains were later arrested and taken into custody.

Silver Samurai approached Old Man Logan wanting to ally in stopping the Hand&#x27;s Regenix operation. He agreed in exchange that Mariko doesn&#x27;t get killed and that Touku and Asami&#x27;s child is taken care of. When Logan and Silver Samurai attack the Hand&#x27;s Regenix operations, Silver Samurai fought Gorgon while Logan fought the Hand Ninjas to confront Mariko. After Gorgon got away, Silver Samurai injected nanites into Mariko to break the Hand&#x27;s control. Afterwards, Logan and Mariko sent Silver Samurai to destroy the Regenix shipments in Madripoor.

<doc id="397710" wikidata="Q4968018" url="?curid=397710" title="Brill railway station">
<text>Brill railway station was the terminus of a small railway line in Buckinghamshire, England, known as the Brill Tramway. Built and owned by the 3rd Duke of Buckingham, it was later operated by London&#x27;s Metropolitan Railway, and in 1933 briefly became one of the two north-western termini of the London Underground, despite being and over two hours&#x27; travelling time from the City of London.

Approximately north of Brill, the station was opened in March 1872 as the result of lobbying from local residents and businesses. As the line was cheaply built and ungraded and the locomotives were of poor quality, services were very slow, initially taking 1 hour 45 minutes to traverse the from Brill to the junction station with main line services at Quainton Road. Although serving a lightly populated area and little-used by passengers, the station was a significant point for freight traffic, particularly as a carrier of milk from the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire to Aylesbury and London. A brickworks was also attached to the station, but it proved unable to compete with nearby rivals and closed within a few years of opening.

During the 1890s, plans were made to extend the tramway to Oxford, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899, and the line became one of the railway&#x27;s two north-western termini. It was upgraded and better-quality locomotives were introduced making the journey time three times faster.

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway came under public control and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and it was felt that there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive.

==Wotton Tramway==
On 23 September 1868 the small Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A&amp;BR) opened, linking the Great Western Railway&#x27;s station at Aylesbury to the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s Oxford to Bletchley line at Verney Junction. On 1 September 1894, London&#x27;s Metropolitan Railway (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&amp;BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR&#x27;s London terminus at Baker Street began on 1 January 1897.

Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, had long had an interest in railways, and had served as chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 until 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a light railway to transport freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&amp;BR&#x27;s line at Quainton Road.
The first stage of the route, known as the Wotton Tramway, was a line from Quainton Road via Wotton to a coal siding at Kingswood, and opened on 1 April 1871. Intended for use by horse trams, the line was built with longitudinal sleepers, to avoid horses tripping.

===Extension to Brill===

Lobbying from the nearby town of Brill for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to a new terminus at the foot of Brill Hill, north of the hilltop town of Brill itself, in March 1872. Two mixed trains each day ran in each direction. With the extension to Brill opened the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two Aveling and Porter locomotives built to a modified traction engine design, each with a top speed of , although a speed limit of was enforced.

The Duke died in 1889. In 1894, the trustees of his estate set up the Oxford &amp; Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&amp;ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to Oxford, but the extension beyond Brill was never built. The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899, although the line continued to be owned by the O&amp;ATC.

==Services and facilities==
Brill was a small town of 1,400 people when the line opened, and owing to the town&#x27;s hilltop setting the station was from Brill itself. Brill railway station was small, with a single low platform. At its opening there was one station building, which served as the freight depot, passenger terminal, and ticket office. Next to it was a siding that led to a cattle pen. Two cottages for station staff were built near the station in 1871. A third cottage across the road from the station was built in 1885, possibly to serve as an office. After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshalls passenger carriage on the line; at this time, a small wooden hut was added to the station to serve as a ticket office and waiting room and a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.

===Passenger services===
From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until its closure in 1935. Limited by poor-quality locomotives and ungraded, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, and with five intermediate stops to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains needed 1 hour 45 minutes to travel the six miles from Brill to the junction station at Quainton Road. Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford &amp; Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR&#x27;s better-quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Brill to Quainton Road to between 32 and 36 minutes.

Serving a lightly populated area, and with trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace, Brill station saw relatively little use by passengers; in 1932, the last year of private operation, Brill station (and the nearby halt at Wood Siding) saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only £191 (about £ in 2025) in passenger receipts.

===Goods facilities===
Although little-used by passengers, Brill station was valuable as a relatively rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also a small amount of coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.

In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham opened a modern brickworks near Brill station, with a dedicated siding, and in 1895 his heir William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe, expanded the brickworks, which became the Brill Brick &amp; Tile Works, using the Brill Tramway to deliver bricks to the main line at Quainton Road. With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, Brill Brick &amp; Tile Works was unable to compete with the nearby brickworks at Calvert, and soon closed. The building was taken over by the Fenemore workshop, making hay loaders, before being converted into a timber yard in the 1920s.

==Closure==
On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London&#x27;s other underground railways except for the small Waterloo &amp; City Railway, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). Thus, despite it being and over two hours&#x27; travel from the City of London, Brill station became a terminus of the London Underground network. Frank Pick, managing director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services, and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that over £2,000 (about £ in 2025) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway. As a consequence, the LPTB decided to withdraw all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935; the last services ran on 30 November.
Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services the lease expired, and the railway and stations reverted to the Oxford &amp; Aylesbury Tramroad Company. With no funds and no rolling stock of its own, the O&amp;ATC was unable to operate the line, and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction. The former goods shed at Brill sold for £7 10s (about £ in 2025), and a railway-owned house attached to Brill station fetched £350 (about £ in 2025). All buildings in Brill associated with the railway station have been demolished, with the exception of the station cottages, one of which is now called &quot;Sleepers&quot;. The station site is now largely open fields, and the site of the brickworks is a light industrial park known as the &quot;Tramway Business Park&quot;.

<doc id="397713" wikidata="Q131471" url="?curid=397713" title="Darts">
<text>Darts is a competitive sport in which two or more players bare-handedly throw small sharp-pointed projectiles known as darts at a round target known as a dartboard.

Points can be scored by hitting specific marked areas of the board, though unlike in sports such as archery, these areas are distributed all across the board and do not follow a principle of points increasing toward the board&#x27;s bullseye. Though a number of similar games using various boards and rules exist, the term &quot;darts&quot; usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules.

Darts is both a professional throwing sport and a traditional pub game. Darts is commonly played in the British Isles, and recreationally enjoyed around the world.

==History==
In 1908, darts was declared to be a game of skill and was thus allowed to be played in pubs. This came about after the landlord of the Adelphi Inn in Leeds was prosecuted for allowing darts to be played in his pub. As darts was considered a game of chance at the time, it was not allowed on licensed premises. The landlord was supported in his case by the best darts player in the region, William &#x27;Bigfoot&#x27; Anakin. A dartboard was hung in the court and Anakin proved that darts was not a game of chance by hitting three double 20s in a row. 

===Dartboard===

The original target in the game is likely to have been a section of a tree trunk, its circular shape and concentric rings giving rise to the standard dartboard pattern in use today. An older name for a dartboard is &quot;butt&quot;; the word comes from the French word , meaning &quot;target&quot; or &quot;goal&quot;.

The standard numbered point system is attributed to Lancashire carpenter Brian Gamlin, who devised it in 1896 to penalise inaccuracy, though this is disputed. Many configurations have been used, varying by time and location. In particular, the Yorkshire and Manchester Log End boards differ from the standard board in that they have no triple, only double and bullseye. The Manchester board is smaller than the standard, with a playing area of only across, with double and bull areas measuring just . The London Fives board is another variation, with only 12 equal segments, with the doubles and triples being a quarter of an inch (6.35 mm) wide.

Mathematically, removing the rotational symmetry by placing the &quot;20&quot; at the top, there are 19 factorial, or 121,645,100,408,832,000 possible dartboards. Many different layouts would penalise a player more than the current setup; however, the current setup actually does the job rather efficiently. There have been several mathematical papers published that consider the &quot;optimal&quot; dartboard.

Before World War I, pubs in the United Kingdom had dartboards made from solid blocks of wood, usually elm. But darts pocked the surface of elm such that it was common for a hole to develop around the treble twenty. The other problem was that elm wood needed periodic soaking to keep the wood soft.

In 1935, chemist Ted Leggatt and pub owner Frank Dabbs began using the century plant, a type of agave, to make dartboards. Small bundles of sisal fibres of the same length were bundled together. The bundles were then compressed into a disk and bound with a metal ring. This new dartboard was an instant success. It was more durable and required little maintenance. Furthermore, darts did little or no damage to the board; they simply parted the packed fibres when they entered the board.

=== Darts ===

The earliest darts were stubs of arrows or crossbow bolts. The first purpose-made darts were manufactured from solid wood, wrapped with a strip of lead for weight and fitted with flights made from split turkey feathers. These darts were mainly produced in France and became known as French darts. Metal barrels were patented in 1906, but wood continued to be used into the 1950s.

The first metal barrels were made from brass, which was relatively cheap and easy to work. The wooden shafts, threaded to fit the tapped barrel, were either fletched as before or designed to take a paper flight. This type of dart continued to be used into the 1970s. With the widespread use of plastic, the shaft and flight came to be manufactured separately, although one-piece moulded plastic shaft and flight darts were also available.

According to the Darts Regulation Authority, a regulation board is in diameter and is divided into 20 radial sections. Each section is separated with metal wire or a thin band of sheet metal.

Quality dartboards are still made of sisal fibres from Eastern Africa, Brazil, and China; less expensive boards are sometimes made of cork or coiled paper.
===Darts===
Modern darts are made up of four components: the points, the barrels, the shafts and the flights.

The points come in two common lengths, and are sometimes knurled or coated to improve players&#x27; grip. Others are designed to retract slightly on impact to lessen the chance of the dart bouncing out.

The barrels come in a variety of weights and are usually constructed from brass, nickel-silver, or a tungsten alloy. Brass is cheap but light and therefore brass barrels tend to be very bulky. Tungsten, on the other hand, is twice as dense as brass; thus a tungsten barrel of equivalent weight could be thirty percent smaller in diameter than a brass one. Pure tungsten is very brittle, however, so an alloy is commonly used, with between 80 and 95 percent tungsten and the remainder usually nickel, iron, or copper. Nickel-silver darts offer a compromise between density and cost. Barrels come in three basic shapes: cylindrical, ton, or torpedo.

* Cylindrical barrels are the same diameter along their entire length and so tend to be long and thin. Their slenderness makes them better for grouping, but because they are long, the centre of gravity is further back.
* Ton-shaped barrels are thin at either end and bulge in the middle. This makes them fatter than a cylindrical barrel of equivalent weight but the centre of gravity is further forward and so theoretically easier to throw.
* Torpedo-shaped barrels are widest at the pointed end and taper towards the rear. This shape keeps the bulk of the weight as far forward as possible but, like the ton, gives it a larger diameter than the cylinder.

The shafts are manufactured in various lengths, and some are designed to be cut to length. Shafts are generally made from plastics, nylon polymers, or metals such as aluminium and titanium; and can be rigid or flexible. Longer shafts provide greater stability and allow a reduction in flight size which in turn can lead to closer grouping; but, they also shift the weight towards the rear causing the dart to tilt backwards during flight, requiring a harder, faster throw.

The flight stabilizes the dart by producing drag, thus preventing the rear of the dart from overtaking the point. Modern flights are generally made from plastic, nylon, or foil and are available in a range of shapes and sizes. The three most common shapes in order of size are the standard, the kite, and the smaller pear shape. The less surface area, the less stability; but larger flights hamper close grouping. Some manufacturers have sought to solve this by making a flight long and thin but this, in turn, creates other problems such as changing the dart&#x27;s centre of gravity. Generally speaking, a heavier dart will require a larger flight.

The choice of barrel, shaft, and flight will depend a great deal on the individual player&#x27;s throwing style. For competitive purposes, a dart cannot weigh more than including the shaft and flight and cannot exceed a total length of .

===Playing dimensions===
The World Darts Federation uses the following standards for play:

*Height: the dartboard is hung so that the centre of the bull&#x27;s eye is from the floor. This is considered eye-level for a tall person.
*Distance: the oche (line behind which the thrower must stand) should be from the face of the board. If the face projects outward from the wall, owing to the thickness of the board or a cabinet in which it is mounted, the oche must be moved back appropriately to maintain the required distance.

The regulations came about owing to the United Kingdom and the rest of the world playing at different lengths, with being the compromise length.

==Scoring==

The standard dartboard is divided into 20 numbered sections, scoring from 1 to 20 points, by wires running from the small central circle to the outer circular wire. Circular wires within the outer wire subdivide each section into single, double and treble areas. The dartboard featured on &quot;The Indoor League&quot; television show of the 1970s did not feature a treble section, and according to host Fred Trueman during the first episode, this is the traditional Yorkshire board.

Various games are played using the standard dartboard. However, in the official game, any dart landing inside the outer wire scores as follows:
* Hitting one of the large portions of each of the numbered sections, traditionally alternately coloured black and white, scores the point value of that section.
* Hitting the thin inner portions of these sections, roughly halfway between the outer wire and the central circle coloured red or green, scores triple the point value of that section.
* Hitting the thin outer portions of these sections, again coloured red or green, scores double the point value of that section. The double-20 is often referred to as double-top, reflecting the 20&#x27;s position on the dartboard.
*The central circle is divided into a green outer ring worth 25 points (known as &quot;outer&quot;, &quot;outer bull&quot;, or &quot;single bull&quot;) and a red or black inner circle (usually known as &quot;bull&quot;, &quot;inner bull&quot; or &quot;double bull&quot;), worth 50 points. The term &quot;bullseye&quot; can mean either the whole central part of the board or just the inner red/black section. The term &quot;bull&#x27;s ring&quot; usually means just the green outer ring. The inner bull counts as a double when doubling in or out.
*Hitting outside the outer wire scores nothing.
* A dart only scores if its point is embedded in or is touching the playing surface. This rule applies to any dart that lands in such a way as to be partially or totally supported by others that have already hit the board.
* When a standard board is used, any dart whose point does not remain in contact with the playing surface until being collected by the player does not score. This includes darts that bounce off the board for any reason, that fall off on their own, or that are dislodged by the impact of later throws. However, when an electronic board is used, fallen/dislodged darts do score as long as their impacts have registered on the board first.

The highest score possible with three darts is 180, commonly known as a &quot;ton 80&quot; (100 points is called a ton), obtained when all three darts land in the triple 20. In the televised game, the referee frequently announces a score of 180 in exuberant style.

===Finishing and check outs===
Once a player reaches a low enough score, they are considered to be &quot;on a finish&quot;, meaning they can win the game/leg with their remaining darts. In professional matches, the match referee will usually tell the player which score they require once on a finish. As the winning dart in a game must be a double or bullseye, the highest possible finish with three darts is 170 (T20, T20, inner bull). Finishes are also known as &quot;check outs&quot;. Regular players become familiar with the combinations needed to check out a particular number. For instance, a player on 138 could hit T20, T18, D12. Most numbers can be checked out with more than one combination (for 138, a player could also hit T19, T19, D12).

Good arithmetic is helpful, as in the event of missing a target number players need to quickly recalculate their new score and which number they now need to hit. For instance, if a player on 93 (T19, D18) hits single-19 with their first dart, they can still finish, but will now need to check out 74 (T14, D16). Checkout charts detailing which numbers are required for each particular finish are widely used.

===The Quadro board===
In the 1990s, a board with a &quot;quad&quot; ring between the triple ring and the bullseye appeared, which gave quadruple points, meaning a &quot;240&quot; maximum (three quad-20s), a &quot;210&quot; maximum checkout (Q20-Q20-Bull) and a seven-dart finish (five quad-20s, triple-17, bullseye) were possible. One make of this board was the Harrows Quadro 240.

The board was used during the short-lived WDC UK Matchplay. Although no seven dart finish was ever scored on the board, John Lowe did come close to a 9 dart finish in the 1993 PDC UK Matchplay. He scored 200 (T20-T20-Q20), then 160 (20-T20-Q20), and got his final T20 and T15, only to miss D18 on his final throw. Several players did score a 240 maximum during the event and Phil Taylor hit a 188 checkout (Q20-Q20-D14). The tournament was discontinued in 1996 and the board has not been used in a professional event since.

===Skill level and aiming===

Assuming standard scoring, the optimal area to aim for on the dartboard to maximize the player&#x27;s score varies significantly based on the player&#x27;s skill. The skilled player should aim for the centre of the T20, and as the player&#x27;s skill decreases, their aim moves slightly up and to the left of the T20. At σ= 16.4mm the best place to aim jumps to the T19. As the player&#x27;s skill decreases further, the best place to aim curls into the centre of the board, stopping a bit lower than and to the left of the bullseye at σ= 100mm.

==Games==
Many games can be played on a dartboard, but the term &quot;darts&quot; generally refers to a game in which one player at a time throws three darts per turn. The throwing player must stand so that no portion of their feet extends past the leading edge of the oche, but may stand on any other portion and/or lean forward over it if desired.

A game of darts is generally contested between two players, who take turns. The most common objective is to reduce a fixed score, commonly 301 or 501, to zero (&quot;checking out&quot;) with the final dart landing in either the bullseye or a double segment to win. Not all three darts need to be thrown on the final turn; the game can be finished on any of the three darts. When two teams play, the starting score is sometimes increased to 701 or even 1001; the rules remain the same.

A throw that reduces a player&#x27;s score below zero, to exactly one, or to zero but not ending with a double or bullseye is known as &quot;going bust&quot;. The player&#x27;s score is reset to its value at the start of that turn, and any remaining throws in the turn are forfeited.

In some variants, a player who busts has their score reset to its value before the individual dart that caused the bust. This rule (referred to as a &quot;Northern Bust&quot; in London) is considered by some players to be a purer version of the game. Under the standard rules above, a player left with a difficult finish (e.g. 5 and one dart remaining) might deliberately bust in order to revert to an earlier score that would allow an easier finish. Under Northern Bust rules, though, doing so would leave them on 5.

A darts match is played over a fixed number of games, known as legs. A match may be divided into sets, with each set being contested as over a fixed number of legs.

Although playing straight down from 501 is standard in darts, sometimes a double must be hit to begin scoring, known as &quot;doubling in&quot;, with all darts thrown before hitting a double not being counted. The PDC&#x27;s World Grand Prix uses this format.

The minimum number of thrown darts required to complete a leg of 501 is nine. The most common nine-dart finish consists of two 180 maximums followed by a 141 checkout (T20-T19-D12), but there are many other possible ways of achieving the feat. Three 167s (T20-T19-Bull) is considered a pure or perfect nine-dart finish by some players.

===Other games and variants===
There are several regional variations on the standard rules and scoring systems.

====American darts====

American darts is a regional U.S. variant of the game (most U.S. dart players play the traditional games described above). This style of dartboard is most often found in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and parts of New York state.

====Beer darts====
Beer darts is a drinking game that involves throwing darts at opponents&#x27; beer cans. The resulting drinking actions depend on how and where the beer can was hit with the dart.

====Belgian darts====
The original name of this sport was called in Dutch Vogelpik (&quot;Birdpeck&quot;). Vogelpik is the early version of the modern game of Belgian darts. Belgian darts has remained a very popular game in the south of The Netherlands and the Belgian community since the 18th century. It is not only relaxing but also helps to develop coordination skills, precision and self-control. Each player has a set of four darts. Four thrown darts equals a turn. Five turns by each player constitutes a game. The dart board score starting from the outside ring are: 5 - 10 - 15 - 20 - 25 - bullseye, even in the modern darts in Dutch still known as &quot;Roos&quot; (English: Rose), 50.

====Cricket====
Cricket is a widely played darts game involving a race to control and score on numbers between 20 and 15 and the bullseye, by hitting each of these targets for three marks to &quot;open&quot; or &quot;own&quot; it for scoring. A hit on the target counts as one mark, while hits in the doubles ring of the target count as two marks in one throw, and on the triples ring as three. Once opened in this manner, until the opponent &quot;closes&quot; that number with three marks on it of their own, each additional hit by the owner/opener scores points equal to the number of the target (which may also be doubled and tripled, e.g. a triple-20 is worth 60 points). The outer bullseye counts as 25 points and the inner as 50.
====Dartball====

Dartball is a darts game based on the sport of baseball. It is played on a diamond-shaped board and has similar scoring to baseball.

====Dart golf====

Dart golf is a darts game based on the sport of golf and is regulated by the World Dolf Federation (WDFF). It is played on both special golf dartboards and traditional dartboards. Scoring is similar to golf.

====Fives====

This is a regional variant still played in some parts of the East End of London. The board has fewer, larger segments, all numbered either 5, 10, 15 or 20. Players play down from 505 rather than 501, and, at , stand the farthest away from the board of any mainstream variation.

====Halve it====

&quot;Halve it&quot; is a darts game popular in the United Kingdom and parts of North America where competitors try to hit previously agreed targets on a standard dart board.
Failure to do so within a single throw (3 darts) results in the player losing half their accumulated score. Any number of players can take part and the game can vary in length depending on the number of targets selected.
The game can be tailored to the skill level of the players by selecting easy or difficult targets.

====Killer====
&quot;Killer&quot; is a &#x27;knock-out&#x27; game for two or more players (at its best at 4–6 players). Initially, each player throws a dart at the board with their non-dominant hand to obtain their &#x27;number&#x27;. No two players can have the same number. Once everyone has a number, each player takes it in turn to get their number five times with their three darts (doubles count twice, and triples three times). Once a person has reached 5, they become a &#x27;killer&#x27;. This means they can aim for other peoples numbers, taking a point off for each time they hit (doubles ×2, triples ×3). If a person gets to zero they are out. A killer can aim for anyone&#x27;s numbers, even another killer&#x27;s. Players cannot get more than 5 points. The winner is &#x27;the last man standing&#x27;.

Another version of &quot;Killer&quot; is a &quot;knock-out&quot; game for three or more players (the more the better). To start, everyone has a pre-determined number of lives, (usually 5) and a randomly chosen player throws a single dart at the board to set a target (i.e. single 18) and does not play until that target is hit. The next player up has 3 darts to try and hit the target (single 18), if they fail, they lose a life and the following player tries. Once a player succeeds at hitting the target, they then become the target setter and throw a dart to set a new target. The initial target setter swaps places with the new target setter. The games carry on until every players&#x27; lives have been used, the last man standing is the target setter whose target was not hit. For less experienced players, doubles and trebles as part of the same number can be counted, i.e. a target of treble 20 can still be counted as a success if the double or single 20 is hit and vice versa.

====Lawn darts====

Lawn darts (also called yard darts and garden darts) is an outdoor game, with gameplay and objective similar to horseshoes, in that the darts are thrown to land in a circle target on the ground. The darts are similar to the ancient Roman thrown weapon . For a brand named Jarts, the darts weighed about 1/4 pound, were 12 inches long, and had a pointed tip, the better to stick into the ground. On December 19, 1988, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission introduced an outright ban on metal-tipped lawn darts in the US after publicity of thousands of injuries and several deaths.

====Round the Clock====
Round the Clock (also called Around the World, 20 to 1, and Jumpers) is a game involving any number of players where the objective is to hit each section sequentially from 1 to 20 starting after a starting double.

====Shanghai====
Shanghai is played with at least two players. The standard version is played in seven rounds. In round one players throw their darts aiming for the 1 section, round 2, the 2 sections, and so on until round 7. Standard scoring is used, and doubles and triples are counted. Only hits on the wedge for that round are counted. The winner is the person who has the most points at the end of seven rounds (1–7); or who scores a Shanghai, which wins instantly, a Shanghai being throws that hit a triple, a double and single (in any order) of the number that is in play.

Shanghai can also be played for 20 rounds to use all numbers. A Fairer Start for Shanghai: To prevent players from becoming too practised at shooting for the 1, the number sequence can begin at the number of the dart that lost the throw for the bullseye to determine the starting thrower. For example; Thrower A shoots for the bullseye and hits the 17. Thrower B shoots for the bullseye and hits it. Thrower B then begins the game, starting on the number 17, then 18, 19, 20, 1, 2, 3, etc. through 16 (if no player hits Shanghai). Shanghai is one of the disciplines in the British Pentathlon tournament.

==== Rugby ====

The game is played across a pitch consisting of the top and bottom three segments (&quot;ideally on a Wide 5&#x27;s dartboard&quot;). Players can move only one square at a time, including those diagonally, the central square (ring &amp; bull) representing midfield, as well as those of the triple area (representing the opponent&#x27;s defensive wall or the 22 m line) so as to finally attain a square of the opponent&#x27;s double section (the try-scoring area), its central square representing the opponent&#x27;s goal, i.e. for points scored between the posts ; during the game players seek to regather possession by hitting the last square occupied by their opponent.

* Kick-off 
- the player (&quot;&quot;) looks to send the ball deep into the opponent&#x27;s half... whom then tries to gather it by hitting the very same square
* Line-out
- is conceded by a player having hit a neighbouring square and adjacent to the pitch ; alternatively by a player inside his own 22 m having hit a square adjacent to the pitch and up to two rows forward ()
- is won by hitting the inner portion of the lateral segment of the board (i.e. 11 or 6 ) – the player without the throw-in required to attain the treble section    
* Scrum
- is conceded after a knock-on (i.e. having hit a square located directly two rows forward – &quot;usually after missing a treble square&quot;)
- is won by hitting the central zone (ring or bull) – the player without the put-in required to attain the bullseye     
* Bomb
- is achieved by a player located behind any of the two treble zones (representing the defensive wall) ... by aiming for the central square of the board ; if they fail they lose possession, if they manage they move two squares forward (if they hit the bullseye they also achieve a &quot;breakaway&quot; and earn three extra shots)
* Penalty 
- is obtained after having grounded the opponent so as preventing them from releasing the ball (i.e. either by attaining a square of a treble zone on which the opponent was located or by attaining the bullseye if they were located in midfield)
- is achieved (&quot;&quot;) either by hitting the opposing goal square (if located in the opponent&#x27;s half), by hand play or – to obtain a line-out – by aiming for a square adjacent to the pitch and up to two rows forward
* Drop-goal
- is achieved (whilst located in the opponent&#x27;s half) by saying &quot;drop&quot; (to signal one&#x27;s intention) and (&quot;&quot;) aiming for the opponent&#x27;s goal square
* Try 
- is scored by finally attaining a square located inside the opponent&#x27;s double section
* Conversion 
- is achieved (&quot;&quot;) by hitting the opponent&#x27;s goal square
====Finnish darts====
 is a casual variety played in Finland, consisting of a simple ringed monochrome board, labeled 1 to 10 towards the centre. Players set the board at a height of 1.5 m (5 ft) and a distance of 5 m (15 ft), earn the landed ring&#x27;s value and go for at least 250 points.

==Darts organisations==
===Professional organisations===

Of the two professional steel-tip organisations, the British Darts Organisation (BDO), founded in 1973, was the older. Its tournaments were often shown on the BBC in the UK. The BDO was a member of the World Darts Federation (WDF) (founded 1976), along with organisations in some 60 other countries worldwide. The BDO originally organised a number of the more prestigious British tournaments with a few notable exceptions such as the News of the World Championship and the national events run under the auspices of the National Darts Association of Great Britain. However, many sponsors were lost and British TV coverage became much reduced by the early 1990s.

In 1992, a group of darts players broke off from the BDO and, in pursuit of higher prize money, formed the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). The PDC organises their tournaments as well as their world championship.

In soft-tip, the World Soft Darts Association serves as a governing body of the sport, with events that feature players that play also steel-tip in PDC events and other players that compete exclusively in soft-tip events.

===Amateur league organisations===
The American Darts Organization (ADO) promulgates rules and standards for amateur league darts and sanctions tournaments in the United States. The ADO began operation January 1, 1976, with 30 charter member clubs and a membership of 7,500 players. In 2014, the ADO had a membership that averaged 250 clubs yearly representing roughly 50,000 members.

==Professional play==

Since the end of the News of the World Darts Championship and other past major tournaments, the BDO and PDC both organised a televised World Professional Championship, however, since the financial collapse of the BDO, their edition of the world championship has not been held since 2020. The PDC championship is held annually over the Christmas/New Year period, as was the BDO event, with the PDC version finishing slightly earlier than the BDO tournament did. The BDO World Championship had been running since 1978; the PDC World Championship started in 1994.

The PDC&#x27;s major tournaments are the World Championship, Premier League, UK Open, World Matchplay, World Grand Prix, European Championship, Players Championship Finals, World Cup of Darts, Masters and the Grand Slam of Darts. All of these are broadcast live on Sky Sports and ITV television in the UK. They also hold PDC Pro Tour events and smaller category events around the UK.

The WDF World Cup for national teams and a singles tournament has been played biennially since 1977. The WDF also organise the Europe Cup. The PDC has their world cup competition, the PDC World Cup of Darts.

For soft-tip darts, WSDA and DARTSLIVE run &quot;THE WORLD&quot;, an international tour which serves as the Soft Darts World Championship, with the final tournament referred to as the Grand Final, with the circuit first taking place in 2011. Stages take place mostly in East Asia, with some rounds held in the United States and Europe. Matches during WSDA events are played with both 701 and Cricket during a set, usually with the same number of games of each, giving both players throws during both formats, and the final round determined by player choice.
Two Dutch independently organised major tournaments, the International Darts League and the World Darts Trophy introduced a mix of BDO and PDC players in 2006 and 2007. Both organisations allocated rankings to the tournaments, but these two events are now discontinued.

===World rankings===

The WDF, BDO and PDC each maintain their own rankings lists. These lists are commonly used to determine seedings for various tournaments. The WDF rankings are based on the preceding 12 months performances, the BDO resets all ranking points to zero after the seedings for their world championship have been determined, and the PDC Order of Merit is based on prize money earned over two years.

<doc id="397714" wikidata="Q27150" url="?curid=397714" title="Ærø">
<text>Ærø () is one of the Danish Baltic Sea islands, and part of the Southern Denmark Region.

Since 1 January 2006 all of Ærø has constituted a single municipality, known as Ærø Kommune. Before that date, there were two municipalities on the island: Ærøskøbing Kommune in the west and Marstal Kommune in the east. This merger was part of a reform of the public sector with the laws being effective as of 26 June 2005. This merger was allowed to happen one year before the other municipalities merged as there had already been an island-wide referendum with a majority of voters for the merger.

In a 2010 survey, readers of the Danish newspaper &quot;Kristeligt Dagblad&quot; voted Ærø as Denmark&#x27;s third most wonderful island, behind only Fur and Læsø.

== Geography ==
* Population (in 2020): 5,956 (island of Ærø only);5,964 (municipality).
* Area: 88 km2 (island); 91 km2 (municipality)
* Length of coastline: 

Ærø measures roughly 20 km from northwest to southeast and varies in width from around 4 to 8 km. There are three small towns on the island in 2020: the largest is Marstal with a population of 2,111. Ærøskøbing has 942 inhabitants and Søby 438. Fourteen villages and a number of farms complete the island&#x27;s pattern of settlement.

Ærøskøbing, with its narrow lanes and picturesque 18th-century houses was historically Ærø&#x27;s chief town, and remains the primary port for ferry connections. Marstal, also known as the &quot;skipper village&quot;, from its being the home of so many sailors and captains, is the island&#x27;s largest town today and is its principal commercial and shopping centre.

The countryside is for the most part gently undulating, and there is a several-kilometre-long stretch of 33-metre-high cliffs at Voderup Klint on the west coast. With its generally low traffic density, Ærø is a popular destination for hikers and cyclists. The island&#x27;s beaches also attract anglers and artists. As one of the islands making up the South Funen Archipelago, Ærø is favoured by particularly fine weather. It enjoys a higher number of sunshine hours than the average for the rest of Denmark, and the year-round temperature is also a few degrees above the national average.

At Olde Mølle, at one of Ærø&#x27;s highest points and near the centre of the island, the sculptor Erik Brandt has created a &quot;peace bench&quot;, conceived with the intention of providing people with an opportunity to survey the island and its surrounding sea, whilst pondering on the theme of world peace.
== History ==


Archaeological excavations provide evidence of settlements going back to before 8000 BC. There are some burial mounds on the island, as well as an old Ting place. Relics of antiquity are found all over the island. Burial mounds, passage graves, and dolmens bear witness of human activity through more than 10,000 years.

As for its more recent history, the period of the duchies is of special interest. During this period — from the 14th century to the year 1864 – Ærø was united and separated, alternately, into a number of enclaves. Ærø was outside the tariff wall of the Kingdom, leading to flourishing smuggling which was a way of living for many of Ærø&#x27;s inhabitants.

In 1629 the main town of Ærøskøbing burnt down in a great fire. There was no other disaster of comparable scale. In 1750 the island, previously split into exclaves of numerous duchies, was united as single administrative district.

Until 1864, Ærø was part of the Danish Duchy of Schleswig – the area of Schleswig/Southern Jutland is now divided between Denmark (&quot;Northern Schleswig&quot;) and Germany (&quot;Southern Schleswig&quot;). King Christian IV&#x27;s cousin, also named Christian, was the Duke of Ærø from 1622 to 1633, and lived with his concubine Cathrine Griebels at Gråsten Manor House.

When the Duke died, a banner was found at Gråsten composed of nine pieces of cloth and in three colours – body colour, sea green, and golden yellow. This banner has provided the inspiration for the flag of Ærø which is seen today all over the island. When Duke Christian died, Ærø was distributed among four of his brothers, and this offers one explanation of why two towns developed in the island, Ærøskøbing and later on Marstal, and why each came to be in their own &quot;country&quot;.

Gråsten Manor House was abolished in 1766 and the buildings were demolished. The name of Gråsten is still alive today in the farmhouse that stands almost on the same spot as the ducal manor. Gråsten of today offers bed and breakfast accommodation.

In 1750, Ærø was united, and has not since been separated. This is marked by the memorial stone at Olde Mølle (English = Ancient mill). At the union, the old &quot;Code of Jutland&quot; from 1241 was applied and even today some of those rules are still valid.

In recent history, the preservation of the area&#x27;s local heritage has been paramount among residents. This passion for Ærø was demonstrated in 2000 when the Marstal Maritime School was ordered to close. More than 2,000 islanders (a third of the island) traveled to Copenhagen to protest the closing of the historic school. Ultimately, the government allowed the Maritime School to remain open.

==Renewable Energy &amp; Technology==
Ærø is endeavouring to become self-sufficient in energy, its initiatives in renewable energy technologies gaining international recognition for the island as one of the world&#x27;s leaders in this field. 
Already in 2002, three modern wind turbines had been erected with turbines whose wingtips reach above the ground. making the island around 40% self-sufficient in renewable energy. As of January 2013, the area of the island&#x27;s large solar power plant was expanded from 18,365 m2 to 33,300 m2 as a result of an extension under the Sunstone 4 project. 

Ærø&#x27;s three district heating systems of solar collectors have won international acclaim. With the recent expansion, the system in Marstal is now the world&#x27;s largest solar collector system for heating.

From August 2019, the island has been served by the , an innovative low weight ferry for cars and passengers, powered by green electricity stored by on-board batteries. Built by Søby Værft, the ferry&#x27;s design is well beyond state-of-the-art in terms of charging power and operating distance. It was partly funded by a €17 million grant through the EU&#x27;s Horizon 2020 scheme.

== Transport ==
Ærø is the only island among the larger Danish Baltic Sea islands that is not connected with a bridge, and road traffic is generally low. There are car ferry lines on four routes. 

Ferries from Fynshav (on Als) and Faaborg on Funen arrive at Søby near Ærø&#x27;s northwestern tip. Twin ferries M/F &quot;Ærøskøbing&quot; and M/F &quot;Marstal&quot; operate on the route from Svendborg arriving at Ærøskøbing. The route between Marstal and Rudkøbing on Langeland was stopped for several years after January 2013 but since 2019 is once again operable using the M/F &quot;ÆrøXpressen&quot;. 

Ærø also lies within a popular sailboat area, the South Funen Archipelago. Near Marstal lies the small Ærø Airport with grass runways.

<text>Miss Porter&#x27;s School (MPS) is a private college preparatory school for girls founded in 1843 in Farmington, Connecticut. The school draws students from many of the 50 U.S. states, as well as from abroad. International students comprised 14% in the 2017–2018 year. The average class size was 10 students in 2017.

== History ==

=== Early history and Sarah Porter ===

Miss Porter&#x27;s School was established in 1843 by education reformer Sarah Porter. She was insistent that the school&#x27;s curriculum include chemistry, physiology, botany, geology, and astronomy in addition to the more traditional subjects taught in girls&#x27; schools. Also encouraged were such athletic opportunities as tennis and horseback riding; in 1867, the school formed its own baseball team, the Tunxises, named after the Saukiog tribe who once settled the area on which the school is situated.

=== Mary Dunning Dow (1884–1903) ===
In 1884, Sarah Porter hired her former student, Mary Elizabeth Dunning Dow, with whom she began to share more of her duties as head of school. From then until her death in 1900, Porter gradually relinquished her control of the school to Dow.

Sarah Porter&#x27;s will named her nephew, Robert Porter Keep, as executor of her estate, of which the school was the most valuable asset. Dow&#x27;s compensation for her position as sole head of school was also specified in the will. As executor, Robert Keep began extensive repairs and renovations to the school. While Dow continued to receive a salary as per Porter&#x27;s will, she became convinced that Keep, in diverting the school&#x27;s income to pay for construction, was enriching his inheritance with funds that were rightfully hers. The conflict escalated and culminated in Dow&#x27;s resignation in 1903. She moved to Briarcliff, New York, taking with her as many as 140 students and 16 faculty members, and began Mrs. Dow&#x27;s School for Girls, which would become Briarcliff Junior College, absorbed in 1977 into Pace University.

=== Elizabeth Hale Keep and Robert Keep (1903–1917) ===
Robert Keep announced in July 1903 that the school would reopen in October 1903 with his wife, Elizabeth Vashti Hale Keep as head of school, 11 teachers, and between five and 16 students in attendance. After Keep died on July 3, 1904, Elizabeth Keep continued to work at the school. One of her many legacies was a kindergarten for children of employees.

===Robert Porter Keep, Jr., and Rose Anne Day Keep (1917–1943)===

When Mrs. Keep died in 1917, leadership of the school passed to her stepson, Robert Porter Keep, Jr., a German teacher at Phillips Academy. From 1917 until the school&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 1943, his wife and he remained heads of school at Miss Porter&#x27;s.

=== Centennial (1943) ===
The school was incorporated as a nonprofit institution in 1943, emphasizing its purpose as a college preparatory school rather than a finishing school. Also in 1943, the school ended the tradition of hiring heads of school from the Porter family, instead selecting Ward L. Johnson and his wife Katharine.

=== Ward L. Johnson and Katharine Johnson (1943–1954) ===

Ward Lamb Johnson had been the headmaster of the Lawrence School for 22 years when his wife and he joined the Farmington community in 1943. He retired 11 years later. During their tenure, Leila Dilworth Jones &#x27;44 Memorial Library was opened. They also increased faculty housing. The &quot;MPS Bulletin&quot; stated: &quot;by the early 1950s the scholastic standing of Miss Porter&#x27;s was among the highest in the country.&quot;

=== Hollis S. French and Mary Norris French (1954–1966) ===

Mary Norris (née Frick) French and her husband Hollis Stratton French served as co-principals of the school from 1954 to 1966.

=== Richard W. Davis (1966–1975) ===

In 1966, then headmaster of The Buffalo Seminary Richard W. Davis was selected to be headmaster at Miss Porter&#x27;s. He was to free the school of its &quot;reputation of being too restrictive and too conservative.&quot; His appointment marked the first time in a half-century that the school would be directed by one person instead of a couple. Reflecting on his tenure at the school, Davis recalled, &quot;We no longer required that girls wear head coverings in bad weather. We allowed pants to be worn, neat ones, to classes, but not to the dining room. We gradually dropped the requirement that all meals were &#x27;sit-down&#x27;, with assigned seating. The changes did not come all at once, yet each one brought some dissent. Certain faculty members felt that standards were slipping.&quot;

=== Warren Smock Hance (1975–1983) ===
Having arrived in Farmington in 1967, also from The Buffalo Seminary (like Davis), Warren &#x27;Skip&#x27; Hance quickly took on administrative roles in addition to teaching history. First he was department chair and then director of development. There followed the appointment to be assistant headmaster, and then to be the ninth Head of Miss Porter&#x27;s School.

=== Rachel Phillips Belash (1983–1992) ===

Immediately prior to her service as Miss Porter&#x27;s head of school, Belash had been vice president at First National Bank of Boston. A native of Wales, an accomplished cellist, and holding a Ph.D. in Spanish literature, Belash was inaugurated 10th head of Miss Porter&#x27;s School for a term beginning in 1983. She was devoted to renewing single-sex education for girls and spoke widely on the topic, as well as writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. One report called her a &quot;visionary&quot;.

=== Marianna Mead O&#x27;Brien (1992–1993) ===
In July 1992, Marianna &quot;Muffin&quot; Mead O&#x27;Brien began her term as head of school, following Belash&#x27;s abrupt resignation at the end of June, and having served the school in years prior on the board of trustees from 1976 to 1983, and, respectively, as parent to three alumnae. Drawing on her experience of 25 years at the Groton School, during which she had &quot;helped start the coeducation program, taught history, tutored reading, and was in the human relations and sexuality counseling faculty,&quot; O&#x27;Brien served a one-year term between the Belash and Ford administrations.

=== M. Burch Tracy Ford (1993–2009) ===
M. Burch Tracy Ford was dean of students at Milton Academy and a residential counselor at the Groton School before coming to Miss Porter&#x27;s. In 1994, she wrote in a letter to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, that “Coed classrooms are the norm, but the norm does not serve girls well; it needs to be challenged, and ultimately changed. Single-sex education is counterculture, but it&#x27;s good for girls.” Ford oversaw the launch of the Oprah Winfrey Endowed Scholarship Fund at Miss Porter&#x27;s, offered through the Oprah Winfrey Foundation. Memorialized in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; by her husband and crew coach Brian Ford, “She was determined that Miss Porter&#x27;s was going to compete on an even level with every school in the country. And she felt that having decent, competitive sports was one element of that.”

=== Katherine Windsor (since 2009) ===
Since 2009, the head of school has been Katherine Windsor, who draws on her experience running the Center for Talented Youth program at Johns Hopkins University and the Sage School in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Her tenure as head of school has seen the school instantiate its partnership with the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education&#x27;s Independent School Teaching Residency program.

In late May 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Windsor presided over virtual graduation exercises.

==Finances==

===Tuition and financial aid===
The tuition for boarding students was valued at $66,825 for 2021–22, plus other mandatory and optional fees. Miss Porter&#x27;s offers need-based financial aid.

===Endowment===
The Dorothy Walker Bush 1919 Fund was established in 1994 in her memory by family and friends to bring speakers to the school who address religion, spirituality, and faith. The Emily Brown Fritzinger &#x27;59 Music Fund was established by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Gardner Brown (Elizabeth Smith 1928), family, and friends; the fund supports musical performances on campus and occasional trips to New York City for all students and faculty to attend a live performance. The Elisabeth S. Hadden &#x27;76 Memorial Fund was established in 1976 in her memory by family and friends to support the annual Haggis Baggis poetry reading. The Kalat Fund for National and International Resources was established by Virginia Lowry Kalat &#x27;39, in honor of her 45th Reunion. The Geri Mullis &#x27;69 Memorial Poetry Fund was established in 1994 by the members of the Class of 1969 in honor of their 25th Reunion to bring a guest artist to campus. The Prescott Program Fund was established in 1961 by Marjorie Wiggin Prescott (class of 1911) to bring distinguished visiting lecturers and performers to the School. The Suzannah Ryan Wilkie &#x27;53 and Janet Norton Bilkey &#x27;53 &quot;Wilkie-Bilkey&quot; Program was established in 1988 by the Class of 1953 in honor of their 35th Reunion to support an annual performance from the world of dance or drama or other live performance. The Oprah Winfrey Endowed Scholarship Fund, offered through the Oprah Winfrey Foundation, for the benefit of eligible students with demonstrated financial need who have displayed both academic excellence and leadership skills. One scholarship beneficiary presented her benefactor with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2011 Governors Awards hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

As of 2022, the school&#x27;s endowment was estimated at $142.3 million.

The 40-acre campus overlooking the Farmington River includes a number of historically significant buildings, which have collectively served the wider Farmington community in a range of functional capacities over their respective histories. Over the years, the school has transformed its campus assets to suit its needs.

===Academic facilities===
* Main House, located at 60 Main Street, and the front door of which is depicted on the school seal, was built in 1830 as the Union Hotel on Main Street, intended originally to serve patrons of the nearby Farmington Canal, rented subsequently to Sarah Porter in 1848 until her eventual purchase on April 19, 1866. Retrofitted with a kitchen during a renovation c. 1870s, the building serves as the center of campus life. The building was renovated in 2021, expanding the dining hall and kitchens.
* Greene House, known locally as Thomas Hart Grist Mill, dates back to the 1600s and predates most structures in its immediate vicinity. Until the 1960s, the site was a functioning grist mill. In 2012, the building was purchased by the school and renovate to serve as the admissions office. 
* Historical buildings Major Timothy Cowles House and Samuel Deming Store are used for faculty housing. The Thomas Hart Hooker House, built in 1770 and located on Main Street, currently serves as the campus alumnae and development office. Through the Ford administration it served as faculty housing to each respective Head of School, and, subsequently, as admissions office. Also of historical note is the Cowles-Thompson House, purchased by the school in May 1961, for use as a faculty residence which is also known as the Vale-Asche House, having been endowed through the &quot;70&#x27;s Fund&quot; by Marion S. Ackerman III (Vale Asche &#x27;51) and A. Dossett McCullough (Bettyann Asche &#x27;57).
*M. Burch Tracy Ford Library is one of the newer academic facilities on campus. It claims to house over 22,000 volumes, electronic books, magazines, journals, newspapers in addition to a collection of 1,308 academic and entertainment DVDs and videos.
* Hamilton was originally the campus infirmary, it was &quot;christened Hamilton, in honor of the strong-minded, strong-willed group of Hamilton sisters and cousins who attended MPS in the late nineteenth century,&quot; most notably Alice and Edith. Today it houses the English and History departments.
* Leila Dilworth Jones &#x27;44 Memorial was a pharmacy prior to the school&#x27;s founding. It houses the language department, which has programs in Spanish, French, and Mandarin.
* Dr. Glenda Newell-Harris &#x27;71 Student Center was built in 1912 by R.F. Jones &amp; Co as the New Music Cottage. It is centrally located on campus, occupying a historic wood-shingled cottage at 62 Main Street, wedged between Main House and Counting House. It was rededicated as a student center in 2022 to Dr. Glenda Newell-Harris, the first Black student to attend Miss Porter&#x27;s School. The building was previously named the Kate Lewis Gym, and served as the school&#x27;s gym and theater. Subsequently the building was home to the school&#x27;s music department and a cappella group, The Perilhettes.
* Ann Whitney Olin Arts and Science Center is the main building for mathematics, science, and arts. Studio art labs include a painting and ceramics studio, each with ceilings and of windows, as separated, respectively, by a textiles lab and a digital media lab, while the lower level of the facility counts as home the department&#x27;s photography classroom and darkroom; all with full wheelchair-access accreditations. The renovation and expansion of this building was designed by Tai Soo Kim.
* The Studio was erected in 1885 by alumnae of the school for use as an art studio; at its entrance a plaque inscribed in Latin reads, &quot;in honor of their most faithful and much loved mistress, Sarah Porter, her scholars have, in grateful spirit, erected this building.&quot; The space is now home to the school&#x27;s music department. Architecturally notable for its state of preservation, it is said to be the only building in Farmington influenced by the Richardsonian movement.

===Athletic facilities===
* The Colgate Wellness Center, situated on the west side of Main Street just south of Porter Road, is an eight-bed licensed infirmary, wholly Ancient-run in its medical and counseling capacities, and itself having been remodeled in recent years to extend the space and streamline student access; known to generations past as Erastus Gay House, or Little Gay for its proximity and size relative the Julius Gay House, itself known alternatively as Weekend House.
* The Student Recreation Center, designed by Tai Soo Kim and built in 1991, includes the Wean Student Center (a gift of the Raymond John Wean Foundation) and Crisp Gymnasium, with an elevated running track, a weight and exercise room, an athletic training room, and four once-standard squash courts, the court space of which has since been repurposed to accommodate a collective of Concept2 machines, a free weight room, and a climbing wall. The school&#x27;s squash program has a permanent home elsewhere on campus.
* The Mellon Gymnasium, designed by Maxwell Moore and built in 1962 as part of the theater-gymnasium complex, was a gift of the Richard King Mellon Foundation. It is home to Varsity badminton in the fall, JV and Thirds basketball in the winter, and is the designated indoor practice space for Varsity and JV Softball in the spring. It is also the official home of the Minks, Possums, and Squirrels, intramural rivalries that feature prominently the week leading up to the Welcome Tradition; outside of the complex, there is a statue for each of the three teams. In a space adjacent to the gym, the Barbara Lang Hacker &#x27;29 Theater is home to the Players/Mandolin Performance Troupe.
* The Gaines Dance Barn, known to generations past as the Play Barn, built ca. 1941 and remodeled in 1993, is the facility, ostensibly located at 64 Main Street, and which serves as both rehearsal and performance space for dance groups, most notably Dance Workshop. In March 1998, the facility was acoustically treated following complications stemming from the 1993 remodel, and, most recently, the space underwent a partial expansion over thanksgiving break 2020, such that it now includes a locker room and foyer space adjacent to the school&#x27;s north entrance on Porter Road.
* The Pool &amp; Squash Building features a 25-yard, eight-lane ceramic-tile competition pool and eight regulation squash courts. The pool was built into the hillside, thereby reducing the impression of its height and using sloped roof lines.
* The Farmington Boat House is home to the school&#x27;s crew program; shared, and duly maintained, in a unique public-private partnership with Friends of Farmington Crew.
* Kiki&#x27;s Field (NCAA regulation synthetic turf) and Maple Field (NFHS synthetic turf) are home to both the school&#x27;s soccer and lacrosse teams; located at 147 Garden Street, together with Cow Barn Field, which itself is home to the school&#x27;s softball team.
* Oaklea Field (full NCAA regulation synthetic turf) is home to the school&#x27;s field hockey and ultimate teams, located at 10 Mountain Road.

==Residential culture and student life==

Approximately 75% of Porter&#x27;s girls live on campus in dormitories, all but one of which are former Farmington private residences left to the school. The school currently maintains a total of nine student residence halls (or &quot;houses&quot;): Brick, Colony, Humphrey, Keep, Lathrop, Macomber, Main, New Place, and Ward, two of those are strictly limited to the senior class. Each residence has a house director who lives in a private suite or apartment in the immediate vicinity, often with his/her family. One of the school&#x27;s distinguishing features is that house directors&#x27; primary responsibilities are within residential houses. Houses traditionally count among their residents two Junior Advisors, student leaders appointed to serve as peer counselors and mediators for each residence, respectively, with the exception of those houses restricted to seniors. Each house is self-governing to an extent, with students responsible for chores on a rotating schedule, the threat of curtailed privileges ever looming. Week-to-week, the Head of Student Activities works closely with the Office of Student Life to build an array of weekend activities; any one weekend has the potential to see a student take in a movie at a nearby AMC Theatres complex, peruse the Westfarms Mall, and partake in a game of lasertag, all in one fell swoop. This privilege is made available on an individual basis, at a student&#x27;s leisure, depending on the student&#x27;s academic or disciplinary standing and barring explicit parental restriction.

In her later years, Ancient Theodate Pope Riddle outfitted a section of her family&#x27;s homestead on Mountain Road as &quot;The Odd and End Shop&quot;, known alternatively as &quot;The Gundy.&quot;

===Clubs, sports, and organizations===
The school claims to have over fifty active student-run clubs and organizations. If a student doesn&#x27;t find an organization that fits their specific interest or need, there is a process by which they can create their own.

====Athletics====
Porter&#x27;s traditional rival is The Ethel Walker School, against which it competes as a member of the Founders League, and, to a lesser extent, the likes of fellow founding members Choate Rosemary Hall, Hotchkiss, Kent, Kingswood-Oxford, Loomis Chaffee, Taft and Westminster. At the end of each season, Porter&#x27;s competes against the league&#x27;s most competitive teams in the New England Championships. The school has no mascot, although some call the teams &quot;Fighting Daisies&quot;. Since the turn of the millennium, student athletes have earned a combined 12 Founder&#x27;s League and 8 New England championship titles.

====Student publications====
The following organizational boards sustain each of the school&#x27;s publications:

* &quot;Salmagundy&quot;, established October 27, 1945, is the school&#x27;s student-run online monthly newspaper.
* The school&#x27;s journal for scholarly writing, &quot;Chautauqua&quot;, sharing its name with the US adult education movement, offers publication examples of student research across a variety of academic disciplines.
* The school&#x27;s yearbook is called &quot;Daeges Eage,&quot; Old English for &quot;day&#x27;s eye.&quot; 
* &quot;Haggis/Baggis&quot; is the school&#x27;s magazine for literature and fine arts, featuring student poems, short stories, photographs, and artwork. It was first published in 1967. The Spring 1984 issue featured writing by a number of outside authors, solicited earlier in 1984 by the magazine&#x27;s editors to discuss their respective visions for the year 2020, notably Anne Bernays, Ray Bradbury, Art Buchwald, then Vice President George H. W. Bush, Anthony Hecht, Edward Hoagland, William Manchester, Richard L. Strout, as well as a four-color print donated by Jamie Wyeth, in tribute to the Eric Blair (1903-1950), author of &quot;1984&quot;.
* &quot;The Language Literary Magazine&quot; is a yearly publication which showcases work by students of foreign languages.

==Archives and special collections==

As one of the oldest independent schools with archival holdings, the school is particularly significant for research. The archives contain a broad array of materials pertaining to the school and its founder. &quot;Sarah Porter’s Rule Book&quot; is in the holdings, as well as many letters, including those sent to her mother and sisters when she made her first visit to Europe in 1872 at the age of fifty-nine.
