<text>General Courtney Hicks Hodges (5 January 1887 – 16 January 1966) was a decorated senior officer in the United States Army who commanded First U.S. Army in the Western European Campaign of World War II. Hodges was a notable &quot;mustang&quot; officer, rising from private to general.

Born in Perry, Georgia, he began studies at the United States Military Academy but dropped out after failing Geometry. He joined the Army in 1906 as a private, rapidly advanced into the noncommissioned officer ranks, and obtained a commission after passing a competitive examination in 1909. As a young man, Hodges served under Colonel John J. Pershing in the Pancho Villa Expedition and became part of the first rescue mission in U.S. military aviation history when he helped save a stranded aviator. He was a battalion commander in France during World War I, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism.

In 1943, he was sent to England to serve under General Omar Bradley. Hodges was deputy commander of First Army during the D-Day invasion. Two months later, he was appointed First Army&#x27;s commander. Under Hodges, First Army had 18 divisions, the most under the immediate command of any general in the European theater of World War II. First Army liberated Paris, was the first Allied army to enter Germany, and cut Nazi Germany in two by advancing east to link up with Soviet forces who advanced west.

==Early life and military career==
Hodges was born in Perry, Georgia on 5 January 1887. He was the fourth of eight children. The Hodges family traces its roots back to England and Hodges&#x27; branch arrived in America in 1750. After the American Revolution, they moved to Houston County, Georgia. Courtney&#x27;s father, John became the proprietor of the local newspaper, &quot;Houston Home Journal&quot;. Hodges attended Perry High School and graduated in 1903. Later he enrolled at North Georgia Agricultural College (now known as the University of North Georgia). He became a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity. After his first year at North Georgia, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point.

He would have graduated with the Class of 1909, but he dropped out after a year because of an inability to comprehend geometry. He then worked at a grocery store for a year.

In 1906, Hodges enlisted in the United States Army as a private and was assigned to Company L, 17th Infantry at Fort McPherson, Georgia. He quickly rose to the rank of sergeant, and in 1909 performed well on the competitive examination for prospective officers. He was appointed a second lieutenant of Infantry in November, just a few months after his West Point classmates graduated, and was assigned to the 13th Infantry. In his early career he served with the future Army Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall, in the Philippines and future General George S. Patton in Mexico.

==Pancho Villa Expedition, World War I and postwar years==
Hodges served in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in San Antonio, Texas and in the Philippine Islands. His first significant military operation was under the command of Brigadier General John J. Pershing, who led an expedition into Mexico to capture Pancho Villa after the Mexican bandit had raided the town of Columbus, New Mexico in the spring of 1916. This less-than successful mission included the first US army use of aircraft in combat. Hodges recorded a footnote in history when he was detached to rescue a stranded aviator, the first such rescue mission in U.S. military aviation history.

Hodges served with 6th Infantry Regiment, 5th Division, during World War I, which America entered in April 1917 (see American entry into World War I). He rose to lieutenant colonel and commander of a battalion in the 6th Infantry, in the St Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne campaigns of 1918. For the latter campaign, he led a scouting expedition across the Meuse River and penetrated the German lines, maintaining a bridgehead through 20 hours of constant fire from the enemy. Their location became the lead point of the American advance across the Meuse. Over the course of the war he earned the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism while leading an attack across the Marne River.

After occupation duty in Germany, Hodges spent the years 1920 to 1924 on the staff at West Point before attending and graduating from the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 1925. He then served as an instructor at the United States Army Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia until 1926, and in a similar capacity at the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell field, Alabama until 1929.

For the next four years, he was a member of the Infantry Board at Fort Benning. Hodges then completed the United States Army War College in 1934. In 1938, he became an assistant commandant of the Army Infantry School, before becoming commandant in 1940. While he was there he formed a friendship with Omar Bradley, who would feature prominently in Hodges&#x27;s future military career.

==World War II==
In May 1941 Hodges was promoted to major general. He was given various assignments, including Chief of Infantry, until he received command of the X Corps, which was stationed stateside, in 1942. In 1943, having been promoted to lieutenant general, he continued to command X Corps and then the Third Army. When the Third Army moved from the United States to England for the projected invasion of Europe, command of the army passed to General George Patton. Hodges was named deputy commanding general of the First Army under Lieutenant General Omar Bradley.

During Operation Overlord in June and July 1944, Hodges served under Bradley as the deputy commander of the First Army. In August 1944, Hodges succeeded Bradley as the commander of the First Army, taking over when Bradley moved up to command the 12th Army Group. Hodges served under the command of Bradley and General Dwight D. Eisenhower until Nazi Germany&#x27;s surrender in May 1945. By the time he took command &quot;it was the largest and most experienced American field army on the Western Front. Consisting of the V, VII, and XIX Corps and controlling nine divisions, it had approximately 250,000 men.&quot;

Hodges&#x27; First Army moved quickly across France, helping to liberate Paris on 25 August 1944 and then led them through France, Belgium, and Luxembourg on their way to Germany. General Hodges&#x27; troops were the first Allied troops to penetrate Germany, having reached the German border (northwest of Trier) on 11 September 1944. These troops were the 5th Armored Division, part of Major General Leonard T. Gerow&#x27;s V Corps.
During the failed British attack on Arnhem, Operation Market Garden, supply priority was given to the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, and the First Army was diverted to the north of the Ardennes to stage limited attacks to draw German defenders south, away from the target sites.

Hodges&#x27; troops had a major role in blunting the Wehrmacht&#x27;s major counteroffensive in the Ardennes: the Battle of the Bulge. When the German advance cut the First Army off from the 12th Army Group and Bradley, his First Army was placed under the temporary command of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, along with Ninth United States Army, on 20 December 1944. The First Army reverted to the 12th Army Group on 17 January 1945.

Before, during, and after the Battle of the Bulge, the First Army fought the Germans in the Battle of Aachen, and the parallel 5-month long Battle of Hurtgen Forest to the south east of Aachen, as part of the main US effort to breach the Siegfried Line and advance through Germany to the Roer River. Hodges led First Army to liberate most of Luxembourg in three days, from 9 September through to 12 September 1944. The city of Aachen was captured on 22 October, but the German counter-offensive and the Battle of the Bulge took place before the other objectives could be completed. Once the Battle of the Bulge was won, the Hürtgen Forest was taken and on 10 February the Rur Dam was finally captured. The overall cost of the Siegfried Line Campaign in American personnel was close to 140,000 casualties.

By 7 March 1945, the 9th Armored Division of the First Army captured the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen. The First Army was the first enemy of Germany to cross the Rhine since the Napoleonic Wars. By the time the bridge collapsed after 10 days, the First Army had built two heavy duty bridges across the Rhine and established a bridgehead 40 kilometers (25 mi) long, extending from Bonn in the north almost to Koblenz in the south, and 10 to 15 kilometers (6.2 to 9.3 mi) deep, occupied by five U.S. divisions. They advanced slowly, waiting for Montgomery and the 21st Army Group to launch Operation Plunder across the Rhine on 23 March.

Together with U.S Ninth Army, the First Army trapped over 300,000 German troops in the Battle of Ruhr Pocket. A month later, Hodges&#x27; troops of the First Army met elements of the Soviet Red Army near Torgau on the Elbe River. Hodges was promoted to the rank of four-star general on 15 April 1945, thus becoming the first of two soldiers in the history of the United States Army to make their way from private to general, the other being Walter Krueger who served in the Southwest Pacific Theater. Bradley said of Hodges, &quot;No other leader and no other armed force unit in World War II is entitled to greater credit than that which belongs to the quiet, modest General Courtney Hicks Hodges and his First Army&quot;.

Eisenhower referred to Hodges as the &quot;spearhead and the scintillating star&quot; of the United States advance into Germany, and sought to ensure that Hodges was properly recognised for his achievements despite &quot;being seemingly overlooked by the headline writers.&quot;

After the end of World War II in Europe on 7 May 1945, Hodges and the First Army were ordered to prepare to be sent the Pacific Theater for the proposed invasion of Japan in late 1945 to March 1946. However, that move became unnecessary when the Japanese Empire surrendered, with the official surrender documents signed in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. Hodges was one of the very few individuals present at the surrenders of both Nazi Germany in Reims, France, and of the Japanese Empire at Tokyo Bay.

==Post-war life==
After World War II, Hodges continued command of First Army at Fort Jay at Governors Island, New York, until his retirement in March 1949. He later acted as the Military Advisor to Sir Owen Dixon, United Nations Mediator to Kashmir.

==Personal life==
On 22 June 1928, Hodges married a young widow, Mildred Lee Hodges (Mildred Lee Buchner). He reportedly courted her by inviting her along to walk his dog and go shooting. They had no children.

==Death and legacy==
Hodges died in San Antonio, Texas, in 1966. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 2, Grave 890-A.

In Perry, Georgia, the State Route 7 Spur, a former section of U.S. Route 41/State Route 7, was named General Courtney Hodges Boulevard. A road in Dinant (Belgium) is named &quot;Avenue Général Hodges&quot;. In Maastricht (Netherlands) the &quot;Generaal Hodgesstraat&quot; is named after him.

Although he possessed fine military reputation as a firm and skilled commander, Hodges was quiet and little known to his troops despite significant efforts to enhance his image and popularity. In his postwar memoirs, Omar Bradley who knew Hodges as well as anyone, wrote:

Still, Hodges has been criticized for his performance during the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. One historian called it one of the &quot;most ill-conceived and unnecessary offensives of the whole northwest Europe campaign&quot;, adding that Hodges &quot;lacked tactical imagination&quot; and that &quot;it was a miracle that he retained Eisenhower’s confidence&quot;.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation===
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, 9 July 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Lieutenant Colonel (Infantry) Courtney Hicks Hodges (ASN: 0–2686), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with 6th Infantry Regiment, 5th Division, A.E.F., near Brieulles, France, 2–4 November 1918. Lieutenant Colonel Hodges personally conducted a reconnaissance of the Meuse River, to determine the most advantageous location for a crossing, and for a bridge site. Having organized a storming party, he attacked the enemy not 100 paces distant, and, although failing, he managed to effect the crossing of the canal after 20 hours of ceaseless struggling. His fearlessness and courage were mainly responsible for the advance of his brigade to the heights east of the Meuse.

<doc id="405134" wikidata="Q1918059" url="?curid=405134" title="Lot in Islam">
<text>Lut (, ) is a prophet and messenger of God who was mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an. According to Islamic tradition, Lut was born to Haran and spent his younger years in Ur, later migrating to Canaan with his uncle Abraham. He was sent to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as a prophet, and was commanded to preach to their inhabitants on monotheism.

Though Lut was not born among the people he&#x27;d been sent to preach to, the people of Sodom are still regarded as his &quot;brethren&quot; () in the Qur&#x27;an. Like the Biblical narrative, the Qur&#x27;an states that Lut&#x27;s messages were ignored by the inhabitants of the cities, and Sodom and Gomorrah were subsequently destroyed. The destruction of the cities is traditionally presented as a warning against homosexuality in Islam as well as other things.

While the Qur&#x27;an does not elaborate upon Lut&#x27;s later life, Islam holds that all prophets were examples of moral and spiritual &#x27;righteousness&#x27;.

==Family==
Muslims maintain that Abraham&#x27;s father was Aazar (), which could be derived from the Syriac &quot;Athar&quot;, who is known in the Hebrew Bible as Terah. Abraham had two children, Isaac and Ismael, who both later became prophets. Abraham&#x27;s nephew is said to have been the prophet Lut, who was one of the other people who migrated with Abraham out of their community. Abraham himself is said to have been a descendant of Nuh through his son Shem.

==Qur&#x27;anic narrative==
The Qur&#x27;an states that one day, a group of angels visited Abraham as guests in the guise of men in order to inform him of the fact that his wife Sarah was pregnant with Isaac. While there, they also told him that they had been sent by God to the &quot;guilty people&quot; of Lut to destroy them with &quot;a shower of stones of clay&quot;. Lut and those who believed in him, were to be spared, but his wife was to die in the destruction, with the angels stating that &quot;she is of those who lag behind&quot;. The Qur&#x27;an also draws upon Lot&#x27;s wife as an &quot;example for the unbelievers&quot; as she was married to a righteous man but refused to believe in his message and was thus condemned to Hell.

The people of the twin cities transgressed against the bounds of God. According to the Qur&#x27;an, their sins included inhospitality and robbery they hated strangers and robbed travellers, apart from other abuses and rape. It was their sin of sexual misconduct as well which was seen as particularly egregious, with Lut strongly chiding them for approaching men with sexual desire instead of women. Lut told and tried to help them to abandon their sinful ways, but they ridiculed him and threatened to evict him from the cities. Lut prayed to God and begged to be saved from the consequences of their sinful acts.

Then three angels, disguised as handsome males, came to Lut as guests. He grieved the men, as he felt powerlessness to protect them from the people of the cities. The cities&#x27; residents becoming aware of the visitors demanded that Lot surrender his guests to them. Distressed and fearful that they would incur the wrath of God, suggested rather lawful marriage to his daughters as pious and purer alternatives to their unlawful wishes, and perhaps as a source of guidance. But they were unrelenting and replied &quot;You certainly know that we have no need for your daughters. You already know what we desire!&quot;, referring to his male guests.

The exegetes Ibn Kathir, Al-Qurtubi and Al-Tabari do not read &#x27;daughters&#x27; to mean Lot&#x27;s literal daughters. They argue that since a prophet is like a father to his nation, Lot was directing the evildoers to turn away from their sins and engage in healthy and pious relationships with the daughters of the nation, i.e. women in general.

The angels then revealed their true identities to Lot and said to him, “Indeed, we will save you and your family, except your wife; she is to be of those who remain behind&quot;. They advised Lot to leave the cities during the night, telling him not to look back. Keeping his faith in God, Lot left the cities in the darkness of night, bringing with him his followers and believing family members. Finally, morning came, and the Decree of God passed whereupon the Qur&#x27;an reads, “When Our command came, We turned the cities upside down and rained down on them clustered stones of baked clay,&quot; And thus was sealed the fate of the twin cities, falling into destruction and despair and marking the end of the civilizations of Sodom and Gomorrah.

==Other mentions in the Qur&#x27;an==
Lut is referenced a relatively large number of times in the Qur&#x27;an. Many of these passages place the narrative of Lut in a line of successive prophets including Noah, Hud, Salih and Shuayb. Islamic scholars have stated that these particular prophets represent the early cycle of prophecy as described in the Qur&#x27;an. These narratives typically follow similar patterns: a prophet is sent to a community; the community pays no heed to his warnings but instead threatens him with punishment; God asks the prophet to leave with his followers and the community and its people are subsequently destroyed in a punishment. Elsewhere in the Qur&#x27;an, Lut is mentioned alongside Ismael, Elisha and Jonah as men whom God favored above the nations ().

==Homosexuality==

Many schools of Islamic jurisprudence state that homosexual sex is a sin, based in part on the story of Lot. Because the Qur&#x27;an states that Lot berated his people for sexually pursuing men, in addition to attempting to assault strangers, the incident is traditionally seen as demonstrating Islam&#x27;s disapproval of both rape and homosexuality. Lot&#x27;s struggle with the people of the twin cities is seen as either concerning homosexuality in general or specifically homosexual anal sex. These interpretations have sometimes widened to condemn homosexuality beyond the physical act, including psychological and social dispositions.

== Monument ==
Many Muslims believe that Bani Na&#x27;im () in Palestine houses the tomb of Lot in the center of the town. The tomb is located within a rectangular mosque with an inner court and minaret. The lintel of the mosque&#x27;s northern gate is built from stones dating to the Byzantine era when a church had possibly stood at the site. Bani Na&#x27;im&#x27;s association with Lot predates Islam, as the works of the Catholic scholar Jerome in the 4th century CE state that the tomb is located in a town named Capharbaricha, which is likely the former name of Bani Na&#x27;im.

Tradition holds that the tomb of his daughters is located on a nearby hill. To the southeast of Bani Na&#x27;im is a shrine dedicated to Lot, known as &quot;Maqam an-Nabi Yaqin&quot; (). Local legend claims Lot prayed at the site and that the imprints of his feet are still visible in a rock there. Similar alleged footprints of prophets and other holy men are found at Islamic shrines throughout the Middle East.

<doc id="405142" wikidata="Q210184" url="?curid=405142" title="Dennis Tito">
<text>Dennis Anthony Tito (born August 8, 1940) is an American engineer and entrepreneur. During mid-2001, he became the first space tourist to fund his own visit to space, when he spent nearly eight days in orbit as a crew member of ISS EP-1, a visiting mission to the International Space Station. This mission was launched by the spacecraft Soyuz TM-32, and was landed by Soyuz TM-31.

== Life and career ==
Tito was born in Queens, New York. He graduated from Forest Hills High School in New York City. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Astronautics and Aeronautics from New York University, 1962 and a Master of Science degree in Engineering Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute satellite campus in Hartford, Connecticut. He is a member of Psi Upsilon and received an honorary doctorate of engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on May 18, 2002 and is a former scientist of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Tito was appointed to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Board of Commissioners during the 1990s and as such he facilitated the 1994 state ruling protecting Mono Lake from excessive water diversions by the city.

===Investment career===
In 1972, he founded Wilshire Associates, a major provider of investment management, consulting and technology services in Santa Monica, California. Tito serves an international clientele representing assets of $71 billion. Wilshire uses quantitative analytics to analyze market risks – a method Tito is credited with helping to develop by applying the same techniques he used to determine a spacecraft&#x27;s path at JPL. Despite a career change from aerospace engineering to investment management, Tito remained interested in space.

In 2020, Tito sold his interest in Wilshire Associates.

===Personal life===
Dennis divorced from his wife Suzanne Tito during the early 1990s, to whom he had been married since the 1970s. They had 2 children together. She had been CFO of Wilshire Associates at the time they relocated into their mansion in Pacific Palisades in 1990 with their children, that they had been building since 1987.

As of 2011 Dennis was married to Elizabeth Pavlova Tito, a Russian investor and Stanford alumna. They lived at Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles. 

From 2016 to 2019, Dennis was married to Elizabeth TenHouten, a businesswoman, poet, author and model.

Since 2020, Dennis has been married to Akiko Tito, an engineer, “pilot”, and investor, who has been interested in spaceflight since childhood. She was born in Tokyo, has an economics degree and relocated to New York in 1995, raising a child prior to her marriage to Dennis.

=== 21st century space interests ===

==== Spaceflight ====
In a project first arranged by MirCorp, Tito was accepted by the Russian Federal Space Agency as a candidate for a commercial spaceflight. Tito was criticised by NASA before the launch, primarily by Daniel Goldin, at that time the Administrator of NASA, who considered it inappropriate for a tourist to ride into space. MirCorp, Goldin and Tito are profiled in the documentary movie &quot;Orphans of Apollo&quot;. When Tito arrived at the Johnson Space Center for additional training for the American portion of the ISS, Robert D. Cabana, NASA manager, sent Tito and his two fellow cosmonauts home, stating, &quot;...We will not be able to begin training, because we are not willing to train with Dennis Tito&quot;.

Later, by an arrangement with space tourism company Space Adventures, Ltd., Tito joined the Soyuz TM-32 mission which launched on April 28, 2001. The spacecraft docked with the International Space Station. Tito and his fellow cosmonauts spent 7 days, 22 hours, 4 minutes in space and orbited the Earth 128 times. Tito performed several scientific experiments in orbit that he said would be useful for his company and business.

Since returning from space, he has testified at the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science &amp; Transportation, Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space and the House Committee on Science, Subcommittee on Space &amp; Aeronautics Joint Hearing on &quot;Commercial Human Spaceflight&quot; on July 24, 2003. Ten years after his flight, he gave an interview to BBC News about it.

==== Inspiration Mars Foundation ====

In February 2013, Tito announced his intention to send a privately financed spaceflight to Mars by 2018, stating that the technology exists already and that the problems that need to be solved are only the rigor of a 501-day voyage psychologically and physically for the human crew. However, in November 2013, Tito and other Mars Inspiration team members admitted that their plan was impossible without significant assistance and funding from NASA. 

====SpaceX Starship’s second commercial spaceflight around the Moon====

On 12 October 2022, SpaceX announced that Dennis and Akiko Tito will be on the crew of the second commercial spaceflight of Starship around the Moon.

<text>Limonoids are phytochemicals of the triterpenoid class which are abundant in sweet or sour-scented citrus fruit and other plants of the families Cucurbitaceae, Rutaceae, and Meliaceae. Certain limonoids are antifeedants such as azadirachtin from the neem tree.

Chemically, the limonoids consist of variations of the furanolactone core structure. The prototypical structure consists of four six-membered rings and a furan ring. Limonoids are classed as tetranortriterpenes.

== Citrus ==
Citrus fruits contain the limonoids limonin, nomilin and nomilinic acid, while both neem seeds and leaves contain the limonoid azadirachtin, although higher concentrations are present in the former.

== Chisocheton erythrocarpus ==
Eight previously unknown limonoids were identified via spectroscopy in the fruits of &quot;Chisocheton erythrocarpus&quot; gathered in Malaysia. These compounds were dubbed erythrocarpines after the species epithet.
The same study tested several preparations of &quot;C. erythrocarpus&quot; extract as larvicidal agent against &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; mosquitoes; they found that 1000 ppm of DCM extract resulted in 100% mortality of larva 24 hours after exposure.

<doc id="405148" wikidata="Q737874" url="?curid=405148" title="Konstantine Gamsakhurdia">
<text>Konstantine Gamsakhurdia () (May 3, 1893 – July 17, 1975) was a Georgian writer and public figure. Educated and first published in Germany, he married Western European influences to purely Georgian thematic to produce his best works, such as &quot;The Right Hand of the Grand Master&quot; and &quot;David the Builder&quot;. Hostile to the Soviet rule, he was, nevertheless, one of the few leading Georgian writers to have survived the Stalin-era repressions, despite exile to a White Sea island and several arrests. His works are noted for their character portrayals of great psychological insight. Another major feature of Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s writings is a new subtlety he infused into Georgian diction, imitating an archaic language to create a sense of classicism.

Konstantine Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s son, Zviad, became a notable Soviet-era dissident who was subsequently elected the first President of Georgia in 1991, but died under suspicious circumstances in the civil war in 1993.

== Early life and career ==

Born into a petty noble family in Abasha in western Georgian province of Mingrelia, then under Imperial Russian rule, Gamsakhurdia received his early education at the Kutaisi gymnasium and then studied in St. Petersburg, where he quarreled with Nicholas Marr. He spent most of the World War I years in Germany, France, and Switzerland, taking his doctorate at Berlin University in 1918. As a Russian subject, he was briefly interned at Traunstein in Bavaria, where Thomas Mann sent him chocolate. Gamsakhurdia published his first poems and short stories early in the 1910s, influenced by German Expressionism and by French Post-Symbolist literature. While in Germany he regularly wrote for German press on Georgia and the Caucasus, and was involved in organizing a Georgian Liberation Committee. After Georgia&#x27;s declaration of independence in 1918, he became an attaché in Georgia&#x27;s embassy in Berlin, responsible for repatriation of Georgian World War I prisoners and placing Georgian students in German universities.

Gamsakhurdia met the 1921 Bolshevik takeover of Georgia with hostility. He edited the Tbilisi-based literary journals and for a short time led an &quot;academic group&quot; of writers which placed artistic values above political correctness. Gamsakhurdia published his writings in defiance of growing ideological pressure, and went on to lead a peaceful protest-rally on the anniversary of Georgia&#x27;s forcible Sovietization in 1922. In 1925 Gamsakhurdia published his first and one of his most impressive novels, &quot;&quot; (&quot;დიონისოს ღიმილი)&quot;, which took him eight years to write. It tells the tale of a young Georgian intellectual in Paris who is detached from his native society and remains a complete stranger in the city of his ideals. This novel, like his earlier works, was partially &quot;Decadent&quot;, and did not please the Soviet ideologists, who suspected Gamsakhurdia of fostering discontent.

== Later life and works ==

After the suppression of the 1924 anti-Soviet uprising in Georgia, Gamsakhurdia was excluded from the Tbilisi State University where he taught German literature. Soon he was arrested and deported to the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea where he was to spend a few years. On his release, Gamsakhurdia was forced to keep silence. On the verge of suicide, the writer fought his depression by translating Dante. Early in the 1930s, he obtained Lavrentiy Beria&#x27;s protection and was able to resume writing, with an attempt at &quot;socialist&quot; novel &quot;Stealing the Moon&quot; (მთვარის მოტაცება, 1935-6), a story of love and collectivization in Abkhazia. Next came the psychological novella &quot;Khogais Mindia&quot; (ხოგაის მინდია, 1937), yet another appeal in classical Georgian literature to this Khevsur myth. Beria was critical of these works, though. Soon Gamsakhurdia was arrested for an affair with Lida Gasviani, a young charming Trotskyist director of the State Publishing House, but interrogated and released by Beria who told him ironically that sexual relations with enemies of the people were permitted.

Gamsakhurdia survived the Joseph Stalin-Lavrentiy Beria purges, which destroyed a large part of Georgian literary society, but resolutely refused to denounce others. He had to pay a tribute to the Stalinist dogma, conceiving a novel on Stalin&#x27;s childhood in 1939. However, as the first published part of this work was not approved by the authorities, it was promptly discontinued and withdrawn from public libraries.

At the height of the Stalinist terror, Gamsakhurdia turned to the more favored genre of historical and patriotic prose, embarking on his magnum opus, the novel &quot;The Right Hand of the Grand Master&quot; (დიდოსტატის მარჯვენა, 1939), set in the early 11th century around the legend of the building of the Cathedral of Living Pillar against a broad panorama of 11th-century Georgia. It deals with the tragic fate of the devoted architect Konstantine Arsakidze, from whom King Giorgi I commissions a cathedral, but Arsakidze becomes the king&#x27;s rival in love for the beautiful Shorena, a daughter of the rebellious nobleman. The clash of powerful human passions, between illicit love and duty, culminates in the mutilation and execution of Arsakidze at Giorgi&#x27;s behest. The story conveys a subtle allegorical message, and the harassed artists of Stalin&#x27;s era can be recognized in Arsakidze.

Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s major post-World War II works are &quot;The Flowering of the Vine&quot; (ვაზის ყვავილობა, 1955), which deals with a Georgian village shortly before the war; and the monumental novel &quot;David the Builder&quot; (დავით აღმაშენებელი, 1942–62), which is a tetralogy about the venerated king David the Builder who ruled Georgia from 1089 to 1125. This work won for the author a prestigious Shota Rustaveli State Prize in 1962. Gamsakhurdia also wrote a biographical novel about Goethe, and literary criticism of Georgian and foreign authors. Publication of his memoirs, &quot;Flirting with Ghosts&quot; (ლანდებთან ლაციცი, 1963) and of his testament (1959) was aborted at that time. He died in 1975 and was interred at his mansion which he called a &quot;Colchian Tower&quot;, refusing to be buried in the Mtatsminda Pantheon because he detested that Jesus and Judas were buried side by side there, referring to the proximity of the graves of the national writer Ilia Chavchavadze and his outspoken critic and political foe, the Bolshevik Filipp Makharadze, who is believed to have been involved in Chavchavadze&#x27;s assassination.

<text>Francis Alexander Shields Jr. (May 16, 1941 – April 25, 2003) was an American businessman and an executive at Revlon in New York City. He was the father of actress Brooke Shields.

==Early life==
Shields was born in New York City. He was the eldest son of Francis Xavier Alexander Sr., a top-ranking American tennis player and Davis Cup winner, and Italian Princess Donna Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi. After his parents&#x27; divorce, his father married Katharine Mortimer in 1949. 

He attended the Buckley School in Manhattan and St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. He attended in the University of Pennsylvania. While at Penn, he captained the crew that rowed in the Henley Royal Regatta in 1962 and was a member of St. Anthony Hall.

==Career==
Shields began his career with Wall Street brokerage Loeb Rhoades. He then worked in sales and marketing for cosmetics firms Revlon and Estee Lauder. He also worked for Handy Associates, an executive recruiting firm in New York City. 

He formed his own real estate firm, Frank Shields Associates, in Palm Beach, Florida in 1989.

==Personal life==
In 1964, Shields married Maria Theresia &quot;Teri&quot; Schmon. They had a daughter, Brooke Christa Shields in 1965. They divorced when their daughter was five months old.

In 1970, he married Diana &quot;Didi&quot; Lippert, former wife of Thomas Gore Auchincloss (son of Hugh D. Auchincloss). They had three daughters: Marina Torlonia Shields, Olympia Torlonia Shields, and Christina Torlonia Shields.

An avid hunter and fisherman, Shields spent much of his free time at Canoe Creek, at a camp he owned in rural west Florida. 

He was a longtime member of The Brook, The Bath and Tennis Club in Palm Beach, Florida, Piping Rock Club, and The Racquet and Tennis Club. 

In 1980, Shields founded the Power Ten, a New York nonprofit organization supporting youth rowing and making contributions to the U.S. National rowing team and U.S. Olympic rowing team through the National Rowing Foundation and Row New York.

In 2003, Shields died in Palm Beach, of a &quot;protracted illness&quot; at the age of 61. After his death, the National Rowing Foundation offered the Frank Shields Fellowships.

<text>Confidentially Yours (; known as Finally, Sunday! in other English-speaking markets) is a 1983 French comedy mystery film directed by François Truffaut. Based on the 1962 novel &quot;The Long Saturday Night&quot; by American author Charles Williams, it tells the story of Julien Vercel (Jean-Louis Trintignant), an estate agent who is suspected of murdering his wife and her lover. As Vercel is hidden in his office, his secretary Barbara Becker (Fanny Ardant) investigates these suspicious murders. It was the last film directed by Truffaut before his death in October of the following year. The film had a total of 1,176,425 admissions in France and was the 39th highest-grossing film of the year.

==Plot==
Julien Vercel, an estate agent in the south of France, is hunting for ducks by the lake, while a man named Massoulier, who hunts in the same area, is shot dead. Julien returns to his office unaware but is soon questioned by the police. He learns that he is the main suspect, because when he left the hunt, he saw Massoulier&#x27;s parked car, turned its lights off to save the battery and closed one of the door upon which he left fingerprints. Furthermore, the deceased Massoulier and Julien&#x27;s wife, Marie-Christine had a secret relationship. When he confronts his wife later at home, she nonchalantly confirms her adultery. While Marie-Christine hides, Julien is taken to the police station for a second interview but is released with the help of his lawyer, Clement who drives him home. In the meantime, Marie-Christine has been murdered. Julien is now the prime suspect. In an effort to prove his innocence he wants to go to Nice, where his wife previously worked, but his secretary, Barbara Becker, argues that she should do the research on his behalf. She does so cunningly when her boss falls asleep in the office. Barbara is secretly in love with her boss, whereas Julien seems to have been indifferent to her.

While Julien hides in his real estate office instead of surrendering to the police, Barbara, who travels to Nice, starts investigating the past life of Marie-Christine. She learns that Marie-Christine&#x27;s real name was Josiane Kerbel, that she has been married to a gambler, and that she lost a great deal of money gambling on horses. She married Vercel only to avoid drowning in debts. The tracks lead Barbara and Julien to a movie theater, then to a night club, and from there to the dark labyrinths of the prostitution area. Barbara and Julien mistakenly assault a suspicious man, believing him to be the real killer. It is revealed that he is, in fact, Massoulier’s brother. At the theatre, a box office clerk and former lover of Massoulier&#x27;s, who accused Julien of murder on the phone, is stabbed to death. Barbara, at her wits&#x27; end, goes to see Julien’s lawyer and finally finds out the truth; Clement and Marie-Christine were lovers. He killed Massoulier because Marie-Christine asked him to, he killed her because she did not want to divorce Julien, he killed the clerk because she knew everything and he would have killed Julien after that.

Barbara and a savvy police officer work together to set a trap for the lawyer. Clement, who smells the trap based on the sound recording at the last minute, commits suicide in a telephone booth after having admitted everything on the phone, when he sees the approaching cops. Julien and Barbara finally get married by Massoulier&#x27;s brother who is a clergyman.

<doc id="405161" wikidata="Q11370254" url="?curid=405161" title="Kyushu Shinkansen">
<text>The is a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed railway network. It is an extension of the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen from Honshu connecting the city of Fukuoka (Hakata Station) in the north of Japan&#x27;s Kyushu Island to the city of Kagoshima (Kagoshima-Chuo Station) in the south. The line runs parallel to the existing Kagoshima Main Line and is operated by Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu).

The southernmost section of the track was constructed first, opening on 13 March 2004. The dual-track offered a significant improvement in transit time over the equivalent single-track section of the Kagoshima Main Line, despite the need for passengers to change to a &quot;Relay Tsubame&quot; narrow gauge train at Shin-Yatsushiro, and the remainder of the journey to Hakata Station. The northernmost section opened on 12 March 2011, enabling through-services to Shin-Osaka (and with an interchange, to Tokyo). However, opening ceremonies were cancelled due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

The Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen route to Nagasaki (from to ) opened on 23 September 2022. A cross-platform interchange to a relay service called &#x27;Relay Kamome&#x27; at Takeo-Onsen station offers a connection to Hakata.

==Kagoshima Route==
Construction of the began in 1991, and the first segment between Kagoshima and Shin-Yatsushiro opened on 13 March 2004. This initial section cut travel times between the two cities from 2 hours and 10 minutes to 35 minutes and reduced the time between Hakata and Kagoshima from 4 hours to 2 hours. When the entire line was completed, the travel time from Hakata to Kagoshima was further reduced to about an hour and 20 minutes. As of 2012, the maximum line speed is between Hakata and Kagoshima. Like all Shinkansen lines, the Kyushu Shinkansen is standard gauge.

The line&#x27;s &quot;Sakura&quot; and &quot;Mizuho&quot; services often operate through to Shin-Ōsaka Station via the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen. All-stop trains are named &quot;Tsubame&quot; (&quot;Swallow&quot;), the name of the former Hakata-Kagoshima limited express service, and are solely truncated to the Kyushu Shinkansen.

In September 2011, six months after the line&#x27;s completion, JR Kyushu reported a year-over-year increase in ridership of 64% to the southern part of Kyushu (between Kumamoto and Kagoshima), easily surpassing the 40% increase projected by the company. By the first anniversary, ridership had increased, mainly from tourists from Kansai and Chugoku. In northern Kyushu, where there is fierce competition with conventional JR rapid service, the private Nishi-Nippon Railroad, and expressway buses, Shinkansen ridership increased by only 38% (compared to the now-discontinued conventional express &quot;Relay Tsubame&quot;), falling short of estimates.

==Nishi Kyushu (Nagasaki) route==
A Shinkansen line from Fukuoka to Nagasaki, initially known as the &#x27;, was laid out in the 1973 Basic Plan. Renamed as the &#x27;, then changed to the in 1995, the segment between and , Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen, opened for service on 23 September 2022.

==Other planned routes==
According to the Shinkansen Basic Plan laid out in 1973, two other routes would accompany the Kagoshima and West Kyushu (Nagasaki) routes: the East Kyushu Shinkansen, from Hakata to Kagoshima-Chūō via Ōita and Miyazaki, paralleling the Nippō Main Line; and the Trans-Kyushu Shinkansen, linking and Ōita, and connecting with the also-planned Shikoku Shinkansen to Matsuyama, Takamatsu and Osaka. These plans have been shelved indefinitely and are unlikely to be reconsidered until the Shinkansen lines that are already under construction are completed.

==Station list==

*&quot;Tsubame&quot; trains stop at all stations. For &quot;Mizuho&quot; and &quot;Sakura&quot;, all trains stop at stations marked &quot;●&quot;, while some trains stop at those marked &quot;▲&quot;. All trains stop at Hakata, Kumamoto and Kagoshima-Chūō.

==Services==
===Kagoshima route===
Services not leaving the Kyushu Shinkansen are operated by 6-car 800 Series trains, with a maximum speed of . The trains were developed by Hitachi, and based on the 700 series trains already in service on the Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen line.

8-car N700-7000 and N700-8000 series trains are used on through-running services between Shin-Osaka and Kagoshima-Chūō. The first set (S1) was delivered to Hakata Depot in October 2008.

Three services operate on the line, in order of speed: &quot;Mizuho&quot;, &quot;Sakura&quot;, and &quot;Tsubame&quot;. The &quot;Mizuho&quot; makes two return trips between Shin-Osaka and Kagoshima-Chūō during the morning hours, and two return trips during the evening, with an end-to-end journey time of 3 hours 45 minutes. &quot;Sakura&quot; services run once per hour throughout the day between Shin-Osaka and Kagoshima-Chūō making additional stops, with an end-to-end travel time of 4 hours 10 minutes. There are also one to two &quot;Sakura&quot; services every hour between Hakata and either Kumamoto or Kagoshima-Chūō. &quot;Tsubame&quot; trains operate the all-stations shuttle service between Hakata and Kumamoto once to twice per hour, with some services operating to/from Kagoshima-Chūō. &quot;Mizuho&quot; trains can be used by foreign passengers traveling with a Japan Rail Pass only upon payment of a supplement.

===Nishi Kyushu route===
Services are operated by 6-car N700S series trains with a service type named &quot;Kamome&quot;.

== Incidents ==

===2016 Kumamoto earthquakes===

On the evening of 14 April 2016, the entire length of the Kagoshima Route was shut down after the first of two powerful earthquakes struck Kumamoto prefecture. There was extensive damage along the route, including cracks in elevated support structures at 25 locations and collapsed sound insulation walls in nearly 80 locations.

An 800 series train was derailed near Kumamoto Station after the first tremor, while the train was deadheading. On 18 April, JR Kyushu began attempts to return the derailed train to the tracks.

On 27 April 2016, the line reopened with reduced speed and service frequency.

=== 2021 Attempted arson ===
On the morning of 8 November 2021, a 69-year old man from Fukuoka attempted to set a Sakura Shinkansen service on fire. The train, Sakura #401, was travelling between Kumamoto and Shin-Yatsuhiro stations at the time of the attempted arson. No casualties were reported. According to the perpetrator, the motive of the incident was to replicate the October 2021 Tokyo attack.

<doc id="405164" wikidata="Q33175" url="?curid=405164" title="East Papuan languages">
<text>The East Papuan languages is a defunct proposal for a family of Papuan languages spoken on the islands to the east of New Guinea, including New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, and the Santa Cruz Islands. There is no evidence that these languages are related to each other, and the Santa Cruz languages are no longer recognized as Papuan.

All but two of the starred languages below (Yélî Dnye and Sulka) make a gender distinction in their pronouns. Several of the heavily Papuanized Austronesian languages of New Britain do as well. This suggests a pre-Austronesian language area in the region.

==History of the proposal==
The East Papuan languages were proposed as a family by linguist Stephen Wurm (1975) and others. However, their work was preliminary, and there is little evidence that the East Papuan languages actually have a genetic relationship. For example, none of these fifteen languages marked with asterisks below share more than 2–3% of their basic vocabulary with any of the others. Dunn and colleagues (2005) tested the reliability of the proposed 2–3% cognates by randomizing the vocabulary lists and comparing them again. The nonsense comparisons produced the same 2–3% of &quot;shared&quot; vocabulary, demonstrating that the proposed cognates of the East Papuan languages, and even of proposed families within the East Papuan languages, are as likely to be due to chance as to any genealogical relationship. Thus in a conservative classification, many of the East Papuan languages would be considered language isolates.

Since the islands in question have been settled for at least 35,000 years, their considerable linguistic diversity is unsurprising. However, Malcolm Ross (2001; 2005) has presented evidence from comparing pronouns from nineteen of these languages that several of the lower-level branches of East Papuan may indeed be valid families. This is the classification adopted here. For Wurm&#x27;s more inclusive classification, see the Glottolog page here.

==Classification (Ross 2005)==

===Small families===
Each of the first five entries in boldface is an independent language family, not known to be related to the others. Languages that are transparently related to each other are listed together on the same line. The first family is a more tentative proposal than the others and awaits confirmation.

Reconstructed pronoun sets for each of the families are given in the individual articles.

*? Yele – West New Britain family [tentative]
*East New Britain family
*North Bougainville family (Bougainville)
*South Bougainville family (Bougainville)
*Central Solomon family
* Dunn and colleagues found no demonstrable shared vocabulary between these fifteen languages.

** Ross considered these four languages in addition to the fifteen studied by Dunn and colleagues.

===True language isolates===
These three languages are not thought to be demonstrably related to each other or to any language in the world.

*Sulka isolate* – New Britain (poor data quality; the possibility remains that Sulka will be shown to be related to Kol or Baining)
*Kol isolate* – New Britain
*Kuot (Panaras) isolate* – New Ireland

&quot;* Dunn and colleagues found no demonstrable shared vocabulary between these fifteen languages.&quot;

===Austronesian languages formerly classified as East Papuan===
Wurm classified the three languages of the Santa Cruz and Reef Islands as an additional family within East Papuan. However, new data on these languages, along with advances in the reconstruction of Proto-Oceanic, has made it clear that they are in fact Austronesian: 
* Reefs – Santa Cruz languages: Santa Cruz, Nanggu, Äiwoo

Similarly, Wurm had classified the extinct Kazukuru language and its possible sister languages of New Georgia as a sixth branch of East Papuan. However, in a joint 2007 paper, Dunn and Ross argued that this was also Austronesian.
* Kazukuru family: Kazukuru language

==Activism==
Cromwell has long been an advocate of progressive causes, particularly regarding animal rights. He became a vegetarian in 1974 after seeing a stockyard in Texas and experiencing the &quot;smell, terror and anxiety&quot;. He became vegan while playing the character of Farmer Hoggett in the 1995 film &quot;Babe&quot;. He frequently speaks out on issues regarding animal cruelty for PETA, largely on the treatment of pigs. In 2017, he was arrested during a PETA protest against SeaWorld&#x27;s treatment of orca whales, at which he spoke about marine mammals&#x27; suffering and premature deaths.

Cromwell served as the narrator of the short film &quot;Farm to Fridge&quot;, a documentary produced by Mercy for Animals.
In February 2013, Cromwell was arrested along with animal rights activist Jeremy Beckham for interrupting a University of Wisconsin Board of Regents meeting while showing a graphic photo of a cat to protest about alleged mistreatment of animals on campus. The incident, which garnered widespread press coverage, was resolved on March 25, 2013, when an attorney representing Cromwell entered no-contest pleas to the non-criminal offense and agreed to pay $100 forfeitures and court costs of $263.50. In December 2015, he was removed from an event in New York for heckling an energy company receiving an award. On December 18, 2015, Cromwell and five other people were arrested while protesting against the construction of a natural gas power station in Wawayanda, New York, near his home in Warwick, New York. He and his fellow protesters, called the &quot;Wawayanda Six&quot;, were convicted of disorderly conduct and obstruction of traffic. They were fined $375, due June 29, 2017, and sentenced to 16 hours of community service. After refusing to pay the fine, he was sentenced to a week in jail, scheduled to go on July 14. However, they were released three days later on July 17. Cromwell and fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor J. G. Hertzler were among the 19 people arrested in Watkins Glen, New York, on June 6, 2016, for a protest against underground gas storage in salt caverns near Seneca Lake. On June 6, 2017, he was escorted out of a Democratic Party fundraiser (which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi attended) after disrupting the event by protesting about the power station. Cromwell was again arrested, this time for trespassing after taking part in a protest along with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) at Seaworld on July 24.

On October 31, 2019, Cromwell was again arrested with 34-year-old animal rights activist Jeremy Beckham. They were charged with disorderly conduct after police said they disrupted a meeting of the Texas A&amp;M University System Board of Regents. The two were part of a demonstration by PETA, protesting A&amp;M&#x27;s use of dogs for medical research. Both were released after posting bonds of $5,000 each.

In May 2022, Cromwell superglued his hand to the counter of a Manhattan Starbucks to protest the surcharge for plant-based milks. Later that year, PETA named him their 2022 Person of the Year. In April 2023, he helped rehome a pig destined for slaughter to the Indraloka Animal Sanctuary and named the pig &quot;Babe&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cromwell married Ann Ulvestad in 1977. They divorced in 1986. Together the couple had three children: Kate, John and Colin. Cromwell married actress Julie Cobb on May 29, 1986; they divorced in 2005. On January 1, 2014, Cromwell married actress Anna Stuart at the home of Stuart&#x27;s former &quot;Another World&quot; co-star Charles Keating. Cromwell lives in Warwick, New York.

Cromwell is known for his height; at , he is the tallest actor nominated for an Academy Award. His son John is even taller, standing . In the 2012 film &quot;Memorial Day&quot;, John played the young Bud Vogel, while James played him as a grandfather, and both Cromwells appear as the same character at different ages in &quot;American Horror Story: Asylum&quot; (2012) and the first season of &quot;Betrayal&quot; (2013).

=== Political views ===
Cromwell&#x27;s experiences of the Civil Rights Movement while on a theatre tour through several Deep South states in 1964 had a profound effect on him. The courage of local campaigners and visiting activists – Cromwell had played high school football with civil rights worker Mickey Schwerner, who was murdered with two of his colleagues in Mississippi in 1964 – convinced him to become an activist. He subsequently became involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement, and by the late 1960s, Cromwell was a member of the Committee to Defend the Panthers, a group organized to defend 13 members of the Black Panther Party who had been imprisoned in New York on charges of conspiracy. All 13 were eventually released. In a 2004 interview with CNN, Cromwell praised the Panthers.

In an October 2008 interview, Cromwell criticized the Republican Party and the George W. Bush administration, saying that their foreign policy would &quot;either destroy us or the entire planet&quot;.

He supported the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

<text>The name Dionysius (; &quot;Dionysios&quot;, &quot;of Dionysus&quot;; ) was common in classical and post-classical times. Etymologically it is a nominalized adjective formed with a -ios suffix from the stem Dionys- of the name of the Greek god, Dionysus, parallel to Apollon-ios from Apollon, with meanings of Dionysos&#x27; and Apollo&#x27;s, etc. The exact beliefs attendant on the original assignment of such names remain unknown.

Regardless of the language of origin of Dionysos and Apollon, the -ios/-ius suffix is associated with a full range of endings of the first and second declension in the Greek and Latin languages. The names may thus appear in ancient writing in any of their cases. Dionysios itself refers only to males. The feminine version of the name is Dionysia, nominative case, in both Greek and Latin. The name of the plant and the festival, Dionysia, is the neuter plural nominative, which looks the same in English from both languages. Dionysiou is the masculine and neuter genitive case of the Greek second declension. Dionysias is not the -ios suffix.

Although in most cases transmuted, the name remains in many modern languages, such as English &quot;Dennis&quot; (&quot;Denis&quot;, &quot;Denys&quot;, &quot;Denise&quot;). The latter names have lost the suffix altogether, using Old French methods of marking the feminine, Denise. The modern Greek (closest to the original) is Dionysios or Dionysis. The Spanish is Dionisio. The Italian is Dionigi and the last name, Dionisi. Like Caesar in secular contexts, Dionysius sometimes became a title in religious contexts; for example, Dionysius was the episcopal title of the primates of Malankara Church (founded by Apostle Thomas in India) from 1765 until the amalgamation of that title with Catholicos of the East in 1934.

<text>Indian Airlines Flight 814, commonly known as IC 814, was an Indian Airlines Airbus A300 that was hijacked on 24 December 1999 by five members of Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. The passenger flight, en route from Kathmandu to Delhi, was taken over shortly after it entered Indian airspace at about 16:53 IST. The aircraft carried 190 occupants — 179 passengers and 11 crew members including Captain Devi Sharan, First Officer Rajinder Kumar, and Flight Engineer Anil Kumar Jaggia.

The aircraft was flown to Amritsar, Lahore, and Dubai. While in Dubai, the hijackers released 27 passengers plus the body of a male hostage who had been stabbed by the hijackers multiple times. Later, on 25 December, the hijackers forced the aircraft to land in Kandahar in Afghanistan. At the time, most of Afghanistan, including the Kandahar airport, was under the control of the Taliban. External intervention was hindered by Taliban men encircling the aircraft, and by the presence of two officers from the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan.

On 27 December after two days of internal discussions, the Indian Government sent a team of negotiators headed by Vivek Katju from the Ministry of Home Affairs, which also included officials Ajit Doval and C.D. Sahay. The motive for the hijacking was to secure the release of various prisoners held under terrorism charges in India. The hijacking is seen as a part of the millennium attack plots in late 1999 and early 2000 by Al-Qaeda linked terrorists. After days of negotiations, India agreed to release three men it had imprisoned for terrorismAhmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargarin exchange for the hostages.

The hostage crisis ended on 31 December when the passengers and crew were released after the Indian government handed the three prisoners over to the Taliban. Despite Indian expectations that the three former prisoners and the hijackers would be arrested, the men were driven to the Pakistan border and released, and they have since been suspected of involvement in other terrorism-related incidents such as the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, 2002 kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl, 2016 Pathankot attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack. India&#x27;s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) charged ten people in relation to the case (with whereabouts unknown for seven including the five hijackers), of whom only two were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.

== Background ==
=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft involved was an Airbus A300B2-101, registered as VT-EDW with serial number 036. The aircraft was equipped with two General Electric CF6-50C engines. The aircraft carried 190 occupants which included 179 passengers and 11 crew members. The crew consisted of Captain Devi Sharan, First Officer Rajinder Kumar, and Flight Engineer Anil Kumar Jaggia. The passengers also included foreign nationals, amongst whom was Roberto Giori, the then-owner of De La Rue Giori, a company that controlled the majority of the world&#x27;s currency-printing business at the time.

=== Hijackers ===
The flight carried five members of Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM) amongst the passengers. Per the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the five perpetrators were later identified as Pakistani nationals Ibrahim Athar (from Bahawalpur), Shahid Akhtar Sayeed, Sunny Ahmed Qazi, Zahoor Mistry (all three from Karachi) and Shakir (from Sukkur). The hijackers used the code names Chief, Doctor, Burger, Bhola and Shankar respectively to refer to themselves.

HuM is an Islamist organisation based out of Pakistan which had split from Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuI) in 1985. It reunited with HuI in 1993 to form Harkat-ul-Ansar, but after it was declared a global terrorist organisation by the United States in 1997, it changed its name back to Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. After its leaders were arrested by Indian Armed Forces in 1993, the organisation perpetrated various attacks and kidnappings in India to secure the release of their leaders imprisoned in India. These included the killing of two Indian army personnel in 1994 and multiple incidents of kidnapping of Western tourists in 1994 and 1995.

Kathmandu had been a major operational base for Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and a hub for other illegal activities. Based on later investigation and statements from others arrested in connection with the incident, the incident was reportedly planned for over two months. The hijackers and their associates made several trips to Kathmandu during this period. The hijack was originally planned for 27 December 1999 but was moved forward later. The tickets for the hijackers were booked through three different tour agencies under false names, and the booking was altered on 13 December. Access to the airport was facilitated through underworld operative Dawood Ibrahim.

== Hijacking ==
On 24 December 1999, the flight took off from Kathmandu en route to Delhi after 16:00 hrs Indian Standard Time. It entered Indian airspace around 16:39 IST, when the passengers and crew were being served refreshments. As chief steward Anil Sharma completed serving the pilots their drinks, a man wearing a mask and brandishing both a revolver and a grenade accosted him and demanded access to the cockpit. At 16:53 IST, the pilot was told that the flight had been hijacked. The Delhi Air Traffic Control was informed of the situation at 16:56 IST.

The hijackers instructed the captain to fly west towards the Pakistani air space. The Crisis Management Group (CMG) of the Indian Government led by Union Secretary Prabhat Kumar was not convened immediately, and information concerning the hijacking was not communicated at that time to the Intelligence Bureau or the Research and Analysis Wing. Then Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was traveling during the incident and was briefed regarding the incident only after he landed in Delhi. He called a meeting to discuss the situation. Passengers recounted that the hijackers ordered the crew to take away the food that had been served, separated the men from the women and children, blindfolded them and threatened them with explosives if they did not cooperate.

=== Landing at Amritsar ===
At 18:04 IST, the Captain radioed the Indian ATC that they had only one hour of fuel left and that the Pakistani ATC had refused permission to land at Lahore. He implored the ATC to reach out to Pakistan, as the hijackers did not want to land in India and had already threatened to execute ten hostages if their demands were not met. At 6:30 pm, the Indian High Commission in Pakistan requested permission for the plane to land there but was denied. At 18:25 IST, the CMG informed the National Security Guard (NSG) to prepare for a possible rescue mission.

When informed of fuel shortage, the hijackers allowed the Captain to land the flight at the Amritsar airport. At 18:44 IST, the flight began its descent towards the airport in Amritsar, following a message from the Captain to the Indian ATC and the CMG was informed of the same. The Indian Home Minister L. K. Advani and Director General of Police for the state of Punjab Sarabjeet Singh both later stated that they came to know of the hijacking from the television news rather than being informed by the CMG. As per guidelines, Singh asked the Inspector General of Police of the area to take charge of the situation. As the officer was on leave, J.P. Birdi, who occupied the position previously, met up with the plane.

At 19:10 IST, the NSG was ready to take off to Amritsar, but had to wait as the Government negotiators did not arrive. On landing at Amritsar, the captain requested immediate refueling for the aircraft. The hijackers had refused to communicate with local police officials while the plane was in Amritsar. Later accounts indicated that the hijackers, who were upset by the delay in refueling, stabbed passengers Satnam Singh and Rupin Katyal with a knife, causing several wounds. The captain made contact with the ATC four times, informing them that the hijackers were armed with Kalashnikov rifles and had begun killing hostages, and requested them to refuel the plane as fast as possible to prevent any additional deaths. Captain Sharan later stated that he had hoped that the ordeal would end with the assistance of Indian government and that the plane would not have to take off again from Amritsar.

=== Take-off to Lahore ===
Meanwhile, the CMG directed the authorities to ensure that the plane was immobilised at any cost and armed personnel of the Punjab Police were put in position to ensure the same. The aircraft engines were kept running and the plane stayed on the runway. A refueling bowser was finally dispatched but it was initially parked to the side. As the aircraft moved, it was ordered to block the aircraft from taking off and it narrowly missed hitting the plane. Then National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra later revealed that a Government had asked for a sniper to be hidden in the bowser, who could shoot if required to disable the plane. Later, it was revealed that this approach caused the hijackers to suspect that the refueling process would prevent their departure, and they ordered Captain Sharan to take off immediately, resulting in the plane narrowly avoiding hitting the fuel tanker on the runway.

Eyewitness accounts later revealed that five passengers had been placed in seats towards the front with their hands bound, and the hijackers threatened that more hostages would be executed if the plane did not take off immediately. The Captain later said that he had to make a decision so as to stop them from killing the passengers. Despite receiving no clearance to take-off, the plane left Amritsar at 19:47 IST. Captain Sharan announced the departure to the ATC stating, &quot;We are all dying.&quot; The NSG lifted off from Delhi at around 19:55 IST and arrived at the airport at 20:15 IST after the aircraft had departed.

On approaching Lahore, the aircraft again requested permission to land, which was denied by the Pakistani ATC. All the lights and navigational aids at the Lahore Airport were turned off to prevent a forced landing. As the plane had not been refueled in Amritsar, it was running out of fuel and Captain Sharan indicated that he would have to crash-land the aircraft. As he made an approach to land on a highway, the Pakistani ATC turned on the navigational aids and allowed the plane to land at the airport. The plane touched down in Lahore at 20:01 IST. On receiving information that the plane had landed in Lahore, India sought a transport for the Indian High Commissioner G. Parthasarathy to travel from Islamabad to Lahore and requested Pakistani authorities to ensure that the plane did not leave Lahore. The runway lights were again turned off to prevent the aircraft from taking off and Pakistani forces surrounded the plane.

As per Captain Sharan, the hijackers were ready to release some women and children aboard the flight, but were denied permission by Pakistani authorities. Parthasarathy later stated that his repeated requests to stop the plane from taking off were not heeded by Pakistan and that he was delayed due to transport difficulties. By the time he arrived at the airport, the plane had been refueled and was allowed to leave. The plane took off from Lahore at around 22:32 IST. The Indian officials reached out to Pakistan for confirmation of reports that passengers on board had been killed, but received no response from the Pakistani authorities.

=== Diversion to Dubai ===
Upon departure from Lahore, the crew was asked to set a course for Kabul. However, as the Kabul Airport did not have any night landing facilities at the time, the Captain expressed his inability to do so. As the plane flew west, most Gulf countries closed their air space to prevent the plane from landing. The flight was finally allowed to land at Al Minhad Air Base in Dubai and touched down at 1:32 IST on the next day. Following negotiations between the UAE authorities and the hijackers, 27 passengers were released in exchange for fuel. The body of the deceased 25-year-old Katyal, who had been stabbed earlier, was also offloaded. The released passengers, including Satnam Singh, who had also been attacked by the hijackers in Amritsar, and the body of Katyal were later flown to India on a special relief plane on December 25.

While the plane was in Dubai, the Indian authorities wanted to attempt a rescue by Indian forces but the UAE authorities refused permission. The UAE authorities sent catering trucks in a bid to further delay the plane, but the hijackers forced the Captain to take off and the plane narrowly made it off the runway. Captain Sharan later opined that he could have chosen to crash the aircraft to prevent it from taking off, but it presented a fire risk as the plane was full of fuel and he could not have done it without the explicit permission of the authorities. The plane later took off from Dubai at 6:20 IST in the morning.

=== Landing in Kandahar and negotiations ===
The aircraft landed at Kandahar airport at 8:33 IST. Kandahar was under the control of Taliban and after the aircraft landed there, India had to negotiate with the Taliban authorities to reach out to the hijackers. India&#x27;s lack of previous contact with the Taliban regime complicated the negotiating process. Since India did not officially recognise the Taliban regime, it dispatched an official from its High Commission in Islamabad to Kandahar and the United Nations also sent negotiators. Armed members of the Taliban surrounded the aircraft, which raised doubts on the intention of the Taliban. The Taliban maintained that the forces were deployed in an attempt to dissuade the hijackers from killing or injuring the hostages but some analysts believe it was done to prevent an Indian military operation against the hijackers.

On December 25 and 26, India internally discussed their approach to negotiations, while passengers were still on board the flight. The plane&#x27;s engine was running continuously to provide lighting and heating as the temperatures dropped during the night. Passengers later stated that they received irregular meals and had limited access to drinking water and sanitation facilities, and that the hijackers utilised the public announcement system on board the plane to proselytize to the passengers. Home Minister Advani opposed any release of prisoners in exchange for the hostages, as this would affect the public opinion of the government, while External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh advocated to negotiate with the Taliban. On December 27, the Indian Government sent a team of negotiators headed by Vivek Katju, Joint-Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs, along with officials Ajit Doval and C.D. Sahay.

The Indian officials found that the Taliban had surrounded the aircraft. Negotiations did not progress, as Taliban officials refused to allow Indian special forces to attempt a covert operation, and declined to allow their own special forces to do so as well. To prevent any military action, Taliban officials later surrounded the aircraft with tanks. Doval later said that the hijackers were getting active support from the ISI in Kandahar and that the ISI had handled the pressure the Indians were trying to put on the hijackers, meaning that their safe exit was guaranteed, and they had no need to negotiate an escape route. He also stated that if the hijackers were not getting active support from the ISI, then India could have resolved the hijacking.

On 27 December, a Taliban official speaking to a local newspaper stated that the hijackers should either leave Afghanistan or put down their weapons. Indian officials interpreted this statement as an understanding that Taliban officials would arrest the hijackers if they surrendered and began to negotiate with them concerning their demands. The hijackers initially demanded the release of Masood Azhar, who was lodged in an Indian prison and stated that they will release ten Indians, five foreigners and other passengers of their choice if the condition is met. India refused the offer and stated that until all the terms are laid down to completely end the hijacking, there would be no negotiations. On the same day, the hijackers made three demands which included the release of 36 prisoners lodged in various Indian jails, the return of the body of HuM founder Sajjad Afghani and in cash. Sajjad Afghani had been arrested earlier by the Indian authorities and was killed during a jailbreak in 1999.

=== Prisoner release and end of the hijacking ===
On further negotiations, the demand was ultimately reduced to the release of three prisoners - Masood Azhar, Omar Sheikh and Mushtaq Zargar. Azhar was arrested for terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir in 1994. Sheikh was arrested in connection with the 1994 kidnappings of foreigners perpetrated by HuA. Zargar, who had at least three dozen murder cases registered against him, had been arrested on 15 May 1992 and imprisoned. On 30 December, RAW chief A. S. Dulat communicated with then Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah to release the prisoners who were then lodged in the state prisons. Abdullah was opposed to releasing the prisoners, warning Dulat of the long-term consequences, but eventually agreed to the demands of the Indian Government. The three prisoners were released and flown to Kandahar.

By this time, the hostages had been allowed to de-plane by the hijackers, and the hijackers had also surrendered their weapons to the Taliban. Passenger accounts indicated that the hijackers asked the passengers to show their gratitude to the Afghanistan Government, following which money was collected and handed to one of the passengers, Anuj Sharma, who was instructed to use it to commission a memento of the hijacking for a museum in Kandahar. India explicitly conveyed to the Taliban that it expected the Taliban to arrest and act against the perpetrators. However, instead of arresting the hijackers and the three prisoners who had been handed over to them, the Taliban authorities gave them ten hours to leave the country and drove them to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

== Aftermath ==
Indian Airlines suspended all flights to and from Kathmandu after the hijack. The airline resumed its Kathmandu services after five months on 1 June 2000 under the same flight numbers, after Nepal assured India of full security at Kathmandu&#x27;s airport. Nepal also agreed to the installation of an additional X-ray machine and a final check of passengers by Indian security personnel at the airport. In January 2000, the security of Indian Airports was handed over to the Central Industrial Security Force. The aircraft was returned to Indian Airlines and was finally scrapped in December 2003.

=== Investigation and trial ===
On 29 December, Indian intelligence intercepted a phone call from Pakistan to Abdul Latif in Mumbai. The phone call directed Latif to contact a news agency in London and inform that the hijackers would blow the aircraft if their demands are not met. The case was investigated by the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which charged ten people for the hijacking, out of whom the whereabouts of seven including the five hijackers were unknown. The hijacked aircraft became the main piece of evidence involved in the subsequent criminal investigation and subsequently a model of the plane was created for the case. Along with Latif, Dilip Kumar Bhujel and a Nepalese citizen Yusuf Nepali, who provided support to the hijackers were convicted.

After almost eight years of litigation, a special court at Patiala sentenced the three accused to life imprisonment on 5 February 2008. While the governments of Nepal and UAE helped with the investigation, the Government of Pakistan refused to cooperate on the same. During the course of the investigation, arrest warrants for the remaining seven accused, who were Pakistani nationals, were forwarded to the Government of Pakistan by the CBI for their extradition to India. Though the CBI also sought the help of Interpol and got red corner notices issued against the seven, none of them were brought to trial eventually.

The CBI later moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court demanding the death penalty for Latif. When the case came up for hearing in September 2012, the High Court dismissed the CBI&#x27;s plea and confirmed the life imprisonment for Latif. It also acquitted the other two from conviction under the anti-hijacking law and confirmed their conviction only under the less stringent arms act. The CBI later approached the Supreme Court of India against the decision.

On 13 September 2012, the Jammu and Kashmir Police arrested Mehrajuddin Dand, who allegedly provided logistical support for the hijacking. Meanwhile, Latif&#x27;s application for parole was rejected in 2015. On 10 July 2020, Latif along with 18 others including an employee of the passport office, was acquitted by a Sessions Court in Mumbai on charges relating to the fabrication of passports in connection with the hijacking incident.

=== Domestic reaction ===
The incident was seen as a failure of then BJP led Government under Vajpayee, with Ajit Doval later saying that India would have had a stronger negotiating hand if the aircraft had not been allowed to leave Indian territory. Then External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh received criticism for praising the Taliban for their co-operation after the hostages had been returned.

Relatives of the passengers aboard the flight also raised public protests at being denied information about the passengers&#x27; health and status, tried to enter the Government briefings and meetings by force to demand information, and held press conferences criticising the Government. A message from the Kandahar ATC was circulated to the public which stated that the plane was being regularly cleaned, and that the passengers were being provided with food, water, and entertainment. This was later contradicted by passenger accounts.

As per a report in Firstpost, then RAW chief Dulat had revealed that Shashi Bhushan Singh Tomar, a RAW officer was aboard the plane during the hijacking. It was opined that a proposal to send the NSG was apparently sabotaged by then secretary to the Indian Prime Minister N. K. Singh, whose sister was married to Tomar. It also stated that, according to former RAW officer R. K. Yadav, Tomar was alerted by a RAW operative in Kathmandu of plans by Pakistan-based terrorists to hijack an Indian plane. However, Tomar rebuked him and told him not to spread rumors. It opined that somehow Tomar ended up on the same plane which was hijacked and became the cause of failure of the operation. Media reports also criticised that then Prime Minister Vajpayee was kept in the dark for more than an hour after the hijacking.

In a report to the Indian Parliament on 1 March 2000, the External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh stated that the Government was not initially aware that the aircraft would land at Amritsar and there was limited information about the number of perpetrators and the nature of weapons. He further stated that the information from the flight crew indicated that attackers had already killed passengers, and any action would have contributed to undue risk. The Indian authorities made all efforts to stop the aircraft from taking off.

=== International reaction ===
Al-Qaeda led by Osama bin Laden provided organisational support for the hijacking and the incident was seen as a part of the millennium attack plots in late 1999 and early 2000 by al-Qaeda-linked terrorists. The Government of the United States released a press release condemning the hijacking incident and called for the release of hostages. Though the United States has engaged against the Al-Qaeda after the bombings of American embassies in Africa in 1998, it actively engaged against the Taliban only after the September 11 attacks. In 2008, Jaswant Singh also opined that the hijacking was a prelude to the 2001 attacks. He criticised that the United States spent millions in Pakistan in the name of fighting terrorism, but the country did not cooperate in taking action against the perpetrators.

UAE was one of the three countries that recognised the Taliban regime. While UAE cooperated with the Indian authorities and helped with the release of hostages, it could not do much to prevent the plane from taking off. Pakistan did not help in ending the hijack attempt and Indian officials described the involvement of ISI. Pakistan Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar blamed India of staging the hijacking to defame the Government of Pakistan.

=== Indian foreign policy ===
Doval, who was part of the negotiating team, described the whole incident as a diplomatic failure due to the Government&#x27;s inability to force the United States and the UAE to help secure a quick release of the passengers. India had actively opposed the Taliban regime ever since it gained power in Afghanistan in 1996 as they were suspected to be involved in training militants for attacks in Indian Kashmir region. Though Taliban had publicly indicated the displeasure at the hijacking, it did not actively help India and shared some similar interests with the ISI.

While Taliban and India negotiated to end the hijacking, it was considered a set back to India as it was forced to negotiate with the Taliban. It later supported the Northern Alliance and provided logistical support to them in the fight against the Taliban. The leader of the alliance Ahmad Shah Massoud visited India on multiple occasions to discuss strategies to take on the Taliban. During the subsequent US invasion of Afghanistan, the Indian Government provided intelligence on training camps of Islamic militants in Afghanistan.

=== Actions of released prisoners ===
The three released terrorists and the hijackers have since been implicated in other terrorism related incidents such as the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, 2002 kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl, 2008 Mumbai attacks, 2016 Pathankot attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack. Azhar later founded Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) in 2000, which gained notoriety for its alleged role in the various attacks, which led to the death of hundreds of civilians and armed forces personnel. Sheikh went on to join Azhar at JeM in 2000 after the release. He was later arrested in 2002 by Pakistani authorities for the abduction and murder of Daniel Pearl. He also played a significant role in planning the September 2001 attacks in the United States. Since his release, Zargar has played an active role in training Islamic militants in Pakistan administrated Jammu &amp; Kashmir.

Amjad Farooqi, who was earlier involved in the 1995 kidnapping of Western tourists in Kashmir by Al-Faran, was also involved in the hijacking under the alias &quot;Mansur Hasnain&quot;. On 1 March 2022, one of the hijackers, Zahoor Mistry, was killed in a drive-by shooting in Karachi, Pakistan. Ibrahim was held responsible for the murder of the passenger Rupin Katyal and the gunmen who killed Ibrahim were never identified.

== In popular culture ==
Captain Sharan was awarded the 1999 Safe Skies Award for &quot;extraordinary coolness and courage in life-or-death circumstances&quot;.

<text>Soyuz TM-32 was a crewed Soyuz spaceflight which was launched on April 28, 2001, and docked with the International Space Station two days later. It launched the crew of the visiting mission ISS EP-1, which included the first paying space tourist Dennis Tito, as well as two Russian cosmonauts. The Soyuz TM-32 remained docked to the station until October; during this time it served as the lifeboat for the crew of Expedition 2 and later for the crew of Expedition 3. In October it landed the crew of ISS EP-2, who had been launched by Soyuz TM-33.

==Crew==
==Docking with ISS==
*Docked to ISS: April 30, 2001, 07:58 UTC (to nadir port of Zarya)
*Undocked from ISS: October 19, 2001, 10:48 UTC (from nadir port of Zarya)
*Docked to ISS: October 19, 2001, 11:04 UTC (to Pirs module)
*Undocked from ISS: October 31, 2001, 01:38 UTC (from Pirs module)

==Mission highlights==
TM-32 carried a three-man crew (two Russians and one American, the latter not a professional astronaut) to the International Space Station, ISS. It docked automatically with the ISS at 07:57 UT on April 30, 2001, just a few hours after the space shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; on mission STS-100 undocked. The launched crew stayed for a week and returned in Soyuz TM-31, which had been docked to (or nearby) the station since November 2000 functioning as &quot;lifeboat&quot; for the onboard crew (Expedition 1 and 2).

As the new lifeboat for Expedition 2 and later Expedition 3, TM-32 stayed docked at the station for six months (except for a brief move between docking ports) and finally, on October 31, brought home two cosmonauts and an ESA astronaut who had arrived a week earlier in Soyuz TM-33.

<doc id="405182" wikidata="Q931056" url="?curid=405182" title="Simutrans">
<text>Simutrans is a cross-platform simulation game in which the player strives to run a successful transport system by constructing and managing transportation systems for passengers, mail and goods by land (rail, road, tram, monorail, maglev), air (airplanes) and water (ship) between places. Like &quot;OpenTTD&quot;, &quot;Simutrans&quot; is an open-source transportation game based on the &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; idea.

== Development history ==
&quot;Simutrans&quot; was originally written by Hansjörg Malthaner in 1997. Around 2004 he retired from development, and an international community of volunteers took over the development. &quot;Simutrans&quot; was developed internally as a closed source game until 2007, when the software was relicensed under the Artistic License 1.0.

&quot;Simutrans&quot; has been ported to Microsoft Windows, Linux, BeOS/Haiku, Mac OS X, and AmigaOS 4.x, which make use of several graphics libraries such as GDI (Windows only), SDL (all versions) or Allegro (BeOS only). It is portable to any architecture using GCC and one of the aforementioned libraries. &quot;Simutrans&quot; has multilingual support.

The current stable release of &quot;Simutrans&quot; is version 124.3 as of January 11, 2025. There is a popular branch of the code called &quot;Simutrans-Extended&quot;, which aims to extend the basic game. &quot;Simutrans-Extended&quot; was formerly called &quot;Simutrans-Experimental&quot;, but changed its name in 2017 to make clear that it is a distinct fork of &quot;Simutrans&quot; and not a testing branch. Nightly builds for &quot;Simutrans&quot; and the main PakSets are also released for both standard and Extended versions.

==Overview and features==

The main goal in &quot;Simutrans&quot; is to provide an efficient transport system for passengers, mail and goods to be transported to their desired destinations fast and with minimal transfers and at the same time making the company grow avoiding bankruptcy or excess administration.

&quot;Simutrans&quot; has a number of factory chains that are interconnected with other chains, for example, a coal mine produces coal for a coal power plant, and an oil rig produces oil for an oil power plant. The goods produced by these factories may be distributed to smaller factories or shops, such as gasoline to a gas station, coming from a gas storage facility, which retrieves the gas from an oil refinery, and so on.

Supplying a factory with electric power will increase the production and allows for fine-tuning the economy. Passengers and mail are transported between different cities and tourist attractions, and may use several methods of transportation to reach their destinations.

The &quot;Simutrans&quot; executable can run many different paksets, which is a package containing files called paks. Paks are files with graphic and data files that Simutrans uses to determine the objects in the game, their resolution, appearance, and behavior. Gaming experience is therefore very dependent on the pakset used.

&quot;Simutrans&quot; currently features 12 AI players, and has an online capability similar to &quot;OpenTTD&quot; since version 110.0. The terrain in &quot;Simutrans&quot; is freely-modifiable, and different layers like tunnels and bridges can be stacked, allowing for subways or highways to be constructed. It has a day and night cycle, different climates and seasons. Nearly all modes of transportation exist in &quot;Simutrans&quot;. At least buses/trucks, trains, and ships are always provided. If defined in the pakset, aircraft, monorails and maglevs can also be used.

&quot;Simutrans&quot; features an online multiplayer mode. Players can join an online game using the in-game server browser. &quot;Simutrans-Extended&quot; also features an online mode, including a long-term semi-persistent online server in which the game world typically lasts over a year before being reset.

==Customization==

The &quot;Simutrans&quot; executable must load a pakset which contains the game&#x27;s objects. Over the years several paksets have been created. An overview is given on the official page.

&quot;Simutrans&quot; can easily be expanded or modified. Simple modification can be done via editing the personal config file. Since the objects in the game just consist of a simple image and a short description file, it is very easy to create a house or add a train. Thus many contributed objects for all graphic sizes exist. The user can also add height maps and citylists which add city names into the game. Even deep modifications of the game mechanics are possible via the config file, like a setting to prevent stockpiling at factories or changing the economic model simulation.

==Critical reception==
GameDaily&#x27;s Big Download considered &quot;Simutrans&quot; to be one of the best freeware games, highlighting the logical system of routing passengers and freight to their destinations, decent AI opponents and the support for custom aesthetics or rules-sets. However, the sometimes unreliable vehicle pathfinding was criticized, particularly with respect to alternate routes and switches for train lines. The sound effects were deemed to be unengaging, and new players may be baffled by the range of transportation possibilities.

Another review from Amiga Future came to very similar conclusions (apart from the lack of sound support on Amiga OS). In particular the depth of simulation and the stability were highlighted.

Between 2007 and June 2017 Simutrans was downloaded from SourceForge over 5.6 million times.

<text>Organum () is, in general, a plainchant melody with at least one added voice to enhance the harmony, developed in the Middle Ages. Depending on the mode and form of the chant, a supporting bass line (or &quot;bourdon&quot;) may be sung on the same text, the melody may be followed in parallel motion (parallel ), or a combination of both of these techniques may be employed. As no real independent second voice exists, this is a form of heterophony. In its earliest stages, &quot;organum&quot; involved two musical voices: a Gregorian chant melody, and the same melody transposed by a consonant interval, usually a perfect fifth or fourth. In these cases the composition often began and ended on a unison, the added voice keeping to the initial tone until the first part has reached a fifth or fourth, from where both voices proceeded in parallel harmony, with the reverse process at the end. &quot;Organum&quot; was originally improvised; while one singer performed a notated melody (the &quot;vox principalis&quot;), another singer—singing &quot;by ear&quot;—provided the unnotated second melody (the &quot;vox organalis&quot;). Over time, composers began to write added parts that were not just simple transpositions, thus creating true polyphony.

== History ==

=== Early &quot;organum&quot;===

The first document to describe &quot;organum&quot; specifically, and give rules for its performance, was the &quot;Musica enchiriadis&quot; (c. 895), a treatise traditionally (and probably incorrectly) attributed to Hucbald of St. Amand. The oldest methods of teaching &quot;organum&quot; can be found in the &quot;Scolica&quot; and the &quot;Bamberg Dialogues&quot;, along with the &quot;Musica enchiriadis&quot;. The societies that have developed polyphony usually have several types of it found in their culture. In its original conception, &quot;organum&quot; was never intended as polyphony in the modern sense; the added voice was intended as a reinforcement or harmonic enhancement of the plainchant at occasions of High Feasts of importance to further the splendour of the liturgy. The analogue evolution of sacred architecture and music is evident: during previous centuries monophonic Mass was celebrated in abbatial churches; in the course of the 12th and 13th centuries the newly consecrated cathedrals resounded with ever more complex forms of polyphony. Exactly what developments took place where and when in the evolution of polyphony is not always clear, though some landmarks remain visible in the treatises. As in these instances, it is hard to evaluate the relative importance of treatises, whether they describe the &#x27;actual&#x27; practice or a deviation of it. As key-concept behind the creative outburst that manifested in the 11th and 12th centuries is the vertical and harmonic expansion of dimension, as the strongly resonant harmony of &quot;organum&quot; magnified the splendour of the celebration and heightened its solemnity.

The earliest European sources of information concerning &quot;organum&quot; regard it as a well-known practice. &quot;Organum&quot; is also known to have been performed in several different rites, but the main wells of information concerning its history come from Gregorian chant. Considering that the trained singers had imbibed an oral tradition that was several centuries old, singing a small part of the chant repertory in straightforward heterophony of parallel harmony or other ways of &quot;singing by the ear&quot; would come naturally. It is made clear in the &quot;Musica enchiriadis&quot; that octave doubling (magadization) was acceptable, since such doubling was inevitable when men and boys sang together. The 9th-century treatise &quot;Scolica enchiriadis&quot; treats the subject in greater detail. For parallel singing, the original chant would be the upper voice, &quot;vox principalis&quot;; the &quot;vox organalis&quot; was at a parallel perfect interval below, usually a fourth. Thus the melody would be heard as the principal voice, the &quot;vox organalis&quot; as an accompaniment or harmonic reinforcement. This kind of &quot;organum&quot; is sometimes called parallel &quot;organum&quot;, although terms such as &quot;sinfonia&quot; or &quot;diaphonia&quot; were used in early treatises.

The history of &quot;organum&quot; would not be complete without two of its greatest innovators, Léonin and Pérotin. These two men were &quot;the first international composers of polyphonic music&quot;. The innovations of Léonin and Pérotin mark the development of the rhythmic modes. These innovations are grounded in the forms of Gregorian chant, and adhere to the theoretical rhythmic systems of St. Augustine. It is the composers&#x27; love for &quot;cantus firmus&quot; that caused the notation of the tenor line to stay the same, even when the methods of penning music were changing. It was the use of modal rhythm, however, that would make these two men great. Modal rhythm is defined clearly as a succession of (usually) unequal notes arranged in a definite pattern. The Notre-Dame composers&#x27; development of musical rhythm allowed music to be free from its ties to text. While it is well known that Léonin composed a great deal of &quot;organum&quot;, it was the innovations of Pérotin, who spent much of his time revising the of Léonin, that caused generations of &quot;organum&quot; and motet composers to exploit the principles of the rhythmic modes.

====Notre-Dame school====

Cultural and intellectual life flourished in Paris during the 12th century with the University of the Sorbonne having become a reputed institution that attracted many students, not all of them French. The construction of Notre-Dame Cathedral on the Île de la Cité took place between 1163 and 1238 and this period coincides with the various phases of development of the Paris style of &quot;organum&quot;. The Cathedral of Notre-Dame and the University of Paris served as the center of musical composition and as a transmitter of musical theory in the 12th and 13th centuries. The presence of Léonin and Pérotin at the Notre-Dame School made Paris the centre of the musical world in the 12th century. Léonin, magister cantus of Notre-Dame, compiled the &quot;Magnus Liber Organi de Gradali et Antiphonario&quot;. Léonin wrote organa dupla based on existing chants like the Alleluia and the gradual of the mass and responsory and Benedicamus Domino of Vespers for the major liturgical ceremonies in the yearly cycle. In hindsight, this turned out to be a major event, as this was the first large-scale project attributable to a single composer. Not only is it a compilation for practical use during mass and office compassing the ecclesiastic year, the first of its kind; it also introduces the use of the rhythmic modes as a creative principle. Thus, when in a discussion of &quot;organum&quot; of the Paris School the word &quot;modal&quot; or &quot;mode&quot; is used, it refers to the rhythmic modes and specifically not to the musical modes that rule over melody.

In Léonin&#x27;s &quot;Organa de Gradali et Antiphonario&quot; two forms of &quot;organum&quot; technique are evident: &quot;organum purum&quot; and &quot;discantus&quot;. &quot;Benedicamus Domino&quot; is a good example of the principles used. &quot;Benedicamus&quot; is usually mixed syllabic—neumatic in that it has mostly one note or maybe two per syllable of text, which is set in florid &quot;organum&quot; over a sustained tenor. &quot;Domino&quot; is in its Gregorian form set in melismatic style with three or more notes to a syllable and here both tenor and duplum proceed in discantus set in the six rhythmic modes, to be finalized with a florid cadence over a sustained tenor. Thus, in larger texts, depending on how the words were set to music, syllabic parts (having no ligatures and therefore non-modal) end up as &quot;organum purum&quot;: the tenor sustains each single note of the chant over which the organal voice drapes a new florid line, written mostly in ligatures and compound neumes. Starting from a consonant, mostly the octave, sometimes lead in by 7–8 over 1, the duplum line explores the harmonious interplay with the tenor, building up to a change of harmony at the end of a melisma where another syllable is produced at a different pitch. Where the Gregorian chant is no longer syllabic but uses ligatures and melismas, both voices proceed in a rhythmic mode. This section of discantus is concluded, on the last syllable of a word or phrase, by a copula, in which the tenor sustains either the penultimate or the last tone and the duplum switches back to a florid cadence, to conclude on a consonance. Thus, in &quot;organum duplum&quot; of Léonin these compositional idioms alternate throughout the complete polyphonic setting, which is concluded in monophonic chant for the last phrase. Thus, three different styles in the organaliter section are alternated and linked according to the text, leaving the last part of the text to be sung choraliter in monophonic chant. The verse of the chant is worked out according to the same principles.

The relevant contemporary authors who write about the &quot;organum&quot; of the Notre-Dame school, Anonymous IV, Johannes de Garlandia, the St. Emmeram Anonymous and Franco of Cologne, to name a few, are not always as clear as could be desired. Nevertheless, much information can be distilled from the comparative research of their writings. &quot;Organum purum&quot; is one of three styles of &quot;organum&quot;, which is used in section where the chant is syllabic thus where the tenor can not be modal. As soon as the chant uses ligatures, the tenor becomes modal and it will have become discant, which is the second form. The third form is &quot;copula&quot; (Lat. coming together) which in the words of Johannes de Garlandia &quot;is between organum and discant&quot;. and according to Waite a bridge section between modal and non-modal sections. It seems that for most instances we can take Garlandia literally where he says &#x27;between&#x27; &quot;organum&quot; and discant. In organa dupla, the copula is very similar to a short, cadential &quot;organum purum&quot; section but in organa tripla or conducti it is seen that irregular notation is used. Either the last notes of ligatures are affixed with a plica which divides the notes in smaller values, or a series of disjunct rests is used in jolting succession in both parts, creating what is also called hocket. These features also can be frequently found in two-part discantus on special cadences or a preparation of a cadence, where they are also referred to as &quot;copulae&quot;. Garlandia states simply: &quot;a copula is where are any number of lines are found&quot;. referring to the plicae or rest-signs. Thus &quot;organum duplum&quot; on a texted chant as a gradual, responsory or the verse of an Alleluia can be schematized as follows:

*beginning of text set to organum: organaliter:
*organum purum » copula »
*discantus » copula »
*organum purum » copula »
*discantus » copula »
*closing lines of text choraliter

In the Notre-Dame repertory the Alleluia itself is only composed organaliter in the opening section, before the Jubilus, the protracted vocalization of the last syllable, which is to be sung choraliter, and as such is absent from all extant original manuscripts. The above stated general principles have been used freely, as in Alleluia V. &quot;Dies sanctificatus&quot;, where &quot;dies&quot; starts off with a little melisma which is judiciously set as a large non-modal florid section over all the notes of the tenor on &quot;di(-es)&quot;, reserving discantus for &quot;nò(-bis)&quot; instead of having a short section in discantus right away at the beginning.

Pérotin &quot;is the best composer of discantus&quot;, according to Anonymous IV, an English student, writing ca.1275, who has provided at least a few morsels of factual information on Paris Organum and its composers. Pérotin further developed discantus in three part Organum (Organum Triplum) where both organal voices are in discantus. Note that organum purum is not possible in three-part organa, all three parts are modal and need to be organized according to the rhythmic modes. Pérotin even went as far as composing two four-part organa (quadrupla), &quot;Viderunt omnes&quot; and &quot;Sederunt principes&quot; which were performed in Notre-Dame in 1198 on New Year&#x27;s Day and in 1199 on the feast of St Stephen (a decree of Odon de Sully, Bishop of Paris, exists which stipulates the performance of &#x27;organa tripla vel quadrupla&#x27;) Apart from organa, Pérotin extended the form of the Aquitanian &quot;versus&quot; which was henceforth called conductus. Any conductus is a new composition on new texts and is always composed in the rhythmic modes. Perotin set several texts by Philippe le Chancelier, while some texts refer to contemporary events. Two-part conductus form the larger part, though conductus exist for one to four voices. Three and four part conductus are, by necessity, composed throughout in discantus style. As in organa tripla, handling three voices (or four) precludes the kind of rhythmic freedom found in dupla. In conductus the distinction is made between &#x27;cum littera&#x27; and &#x27;sine litera&#x27;, texted sections and melismatic sections. The texted parts can sometimes go beyond the modal measure and then fall back into regular mode in the melismatic section. Again according to Anonymous IV, Pérotin wrote a number of replacement clausulae from organa dupla by Léonin. As the tenor in organa dupla in discant sections proceeds always in the 5th mode (all longs in a rhythmic group ordine), Pérotin, who was a generation removed from Léonin, saw fit to improve them by introducing different modes for the tenor and new melodic lines for the dupla, increasing the rhythmic organization and diversity of the section. However, in the largest compilation of Notre-Dame repertoires (F) no less than 462 clausulae exist, many recurrences of the same clausulae (Domino, et gaudebit in variant settings, according to. &#x27;written in a variety of styles and with varying competence&#x27; A further innovation was the motellus, to be found in W2, in which the upper part of a discant section is supplied with a new text, so that when the tenor utters a single syllable of chant, the upper part will pronounce several syllables or words. As such it reminds of the prosulae that were composed, replacing a long melisma in a chant with new, additional words. This would have been the first instance of two different texts being sung in harmony. In turn, the motellus gave birth to the motet which is a poly-textual piece in discant, which obviously sparked a lot a creativity as it soon became a prolific form of composition.

The organa that were created in Paris were disseminated throughout Europe. The three main sources are W1, St. Andrews, Wolfenbüttel 677, olim Helmstedt 628; the large and illuminated copy made in Florence, owned by Piero de Medici, the Pluteo 29.1 of the Bibliotheca Mediceo-Laurenziana (F), which is by far the most extensive copy of the repertory. Finally W2, Wolfenbüttel 1206, olim Helmstedt 1099, which was compiled the latest (and contains the greatest number of motets).

There are arguments that support a relative freedom of rhythm in organa dupla but others who say that the interpretation of the music should always be according to modal or Franconian principles. Willi Apel and William G. Waite insisted upon a rigorously modal interpretation. Though Waite in his dissertation, notably in chapter 4: The notation of organum duplum&#x27; acknowledged that in organum duplum and monophonic conducts relative freedom may have been taken, he transcribed a selection of the &quot;Magnus Liber Organi&quot; of Léonin into strict modal rhythm. Apel argued that the long values for dissonances (in violation of the basic principle of consonance) produced by modal rhythms in Notre-Dame organa, can be reconciled by a statement made by several medieval theorists that &quot;the tenor pauses, if a dissonance appears&quot;. Debates on interpretation are ongoing. However, Waite was working in the 1950s, and his point of view has been supplanted by newer research: &quot;...but [Waite&#x27;s] view that the entire corpus [of the Magnus Liber Organi] should be transcribed according to the rhythmic modes is no longer accepted&quot; (Peter Jeffery in the Notation Course Medieval Music 1100–1450, Princeton).

In the range of forms of compositions found in the later two manuscripts that contain the Notre-Dame repertory (F and W2) one class of distinction can be made: that which is (strictly) modal and that which is not. Organum duplum in its organum purum sections of syllabic setting, the cum littera sections in two-part conductus, copulae in general and monophonic conductus would be that part of the repertory which is not strictly modal. In monophonic song, be it chant or a conductus simplex by Perotin, there is no need to vary from the classical standards for declamation that were a rooted tradition at the time, going back to St. Augustine&#x27;s &quot;De Musica&quot;. It has been firmly established by extensive research in chant traditions (Gregorian Semiology) that there is a fluency and variability in the rhythm of declamatory speech that should also govern chant performance. These principles extend to the not strictly modal sections or compositions, as a contrasting quality with musica mensurabilis.

As Parisian Organum is rooted in Gregorian chant tradition, it is categorized under Ars antiqua which is thus called in contrast to the Ars nova which embarked on new forms that were in every sense original and no longer based on Gregorian chant and as such constituted a break with the musical practice of the ancients.

<doc id="405184" wikidata="Q59630" url="?curid=405184" title="Roddy Piper">
<text>Roderick George Toombs (April 17, 1954 – July 31, 2015), better known as &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper, was a Canadian professional wrestler and actor.

In professional wrestling, Piper was best known to international audiences for his work with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) between 1984 and 2000. Although he was Canadian, Piper was billed as coming from Glasgow and was known for his signature kilt and bagpipe entrance music; this was because of his Scottish heritage. Piper earned the nicknames &quot;Rowdy&quot; and &quot;Hot Rod&quot; by displaying his trademark &quot;Scottish&quot; short temper, spontaneity, and quick wit. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, he is &quot;considered by many to be the greatest &#x27;heel&#x27; (or villain) wrestler ever&quot;.

One of wrestling&#x27;s most recognizable stars, Piper headlined multiple pay-per-view events, including the WWF and WCW&#x27;s respective premier annual events, WrestleMania and Starrcade. He accumulated 34 championships and hosted the popular WWF/WWE interview segment &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;, which facilitated numerous kayfabe feuds. In 2005, Piper was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Ric Flair, who dubbed him &quot;the most gifted entertainer in the history of professional wrestling&quot;.

Outside of wrestling, Piper acted in dozens of films and TV shows. Most notably, he took the lead role of John Nada in the 1988 cult classic &quot;They Live&quot; and a recurring role as deranged professional wrestler Da&#x27; Maniac on the FX comedy series &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;.

== Early life ==
Roderick George Toombs was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, on April 17, 1954, the son of Eileen (&quot;née&quot; Anderson), a Scottish-Canadian and Stanley Baird Toombs, an Anglo-Canadian. He was raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and attended Windsor Park Collegiate. His father was an officer with the CN Rail Police (Canadian National Railway) while they lived in The Pas, Manitoba. After being expelled from junior high for having a switchblade in school and falling out with his father, Toombs left home and stayed in youth hostels. Several professional wrestlers hired him to run errands as he picked up odd jobs at nearby gyms. As a young man, he became proficient in playing the bagpipes, though he repeatedly stated that he was unsure exactly where he picked them up. His childhood (and lifelong) best friend was ex-NHL player Cam Connor.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Training and early career (1969–1975) ===
Piper was an amateur wrestler before he started to become a professional wrestler. He claimed to have won the Golden Gloves boxing championship, though their lists of champions do not include any of his names. He was awarded a black belt in Judo from Gene LeBell. He started wrestling under the care of promoter Al Tomko in Canada, his first match involving &quot;midget wrestlers&quot; in front of a lumberjack audience in Churchill, Manitoba. He soon began earning money wrestling while still going to school. His first match in a famous organization was with Larry Hennig in the American Wrestling Association (AWA). Friends of his played the bagpipes during his entrance while he was handing out dandelions; meanwhile, the ring announcer had to announce something, but all he knew was that Piper&#x27;s name was Roddy. Subsequently, after seeing the pipe band, he announced, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, here comes Roddy the piper.&quot; This gave birth to the name &quot;Roddy Piper&quot;. From 1973 to 1975, Piper was a jobber in the AWA, NWA Central States territory surrounding Kansas City, and Eastern Sports Association in the Maritimes. He also worked in Texas for Paul Boesch&#x27;s NWA Houston Wrestling promotion, and in Dallas for Fritz Von Erich&#x27;s Big Time Rasslin.

=== National Wrestling Alliance territories (1975–1983) ===
==== California and Portland (1975–1980) ====
By late 1975 and early 1976, Piper was a top villain for Mike and Gene LeBell&#x27;s NWA Hollywood Wrestling. In 1977–78, he also started to work for Roy Shire&#x27;s NWA San Francisco Wrestling in addition to remaining with the Los Angeles office, where Piper developed his Rowdy character. During this time, he made continuous insults directed at the area&#x27;s Mexican community; he later promised to make up for this by playing the Mexican national anthem on his bagpipes only to anger the fans further by playing &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; instead, which in turn caused a riot. Piper also managed a stable of wrestlers in California.

In the Los Angeles area, Piper feuded with Chavo Guerrero Sr., and his father Gory Guerrero. Piper and Chavo Guerrero faced each other in several matches for the Jules Strongbow Memorial Scientific Trophy. Piper also defeated Chavo for the Americas Heavyweight Title. During the feud, Piper lost a hair match and had his head shaved. Piper appeared in several loser leave town matches and was forced to leave the territory. He also appeared in the territory as The Masked Canadian. In his first televised match as The Masked Canadian, Piper teamed with Chavo in a match against Black Gordman and Goliath for the Americas Tag Team Championship. Piper and Guerrero lost the match and faced each other two days later, with Piper defeating Guerrero for the Americas Heavyweight Championship. Piper wrestled as The Masked Canadian for several months until he was unmasked by Hector Guerrero.

By late 1978-early 1979, Piper left the California promotions for even more fame in Don Owen&#x27;s Portland-based Pacific Northwest territory. He teamed with Killer Tim Brooks and Rick Martel to win the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship. Piper also won the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship with victories over both Lord Jonathan Boyd and &quot;Playboy&quot; Buddy Rose.

==== Georgia and Mid-Atlantic (1980–1983) ====
In the early 1980s, Piper ventured to the Mid-Atlantic territory where he beat Jack Brisco for the Mid-Atlantic title. He also defeated Ric Flair for the US belt which turned into a feud. From 1981 to 1982, Piper served as a commentator on Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and feuded with the likes of Bob Armstrong, Dick Slater, and Tommy Rich. During the summer of 1982, Piper became a fan favorite after knocking out Don Muraco and Ole Anderson to save broadcast partner Gordon Solie from Muraco, who had grown angry at Solie questioning his tactics. In &quot;Wrestling to Rasslin&quot;, Gerald W. Morton and George M. O&#x27;Brien described the transformation: &quot;the drama finally played itself out on television when one of his [Piper&#x27;s] hired assassins, Don Muraco, suddenly attacked the commentator Gordon Solie. Seeing Solie hurt, Piper unleashed his Scottish fury on Muraco. In the week that followed, like Achilles avenging Patroklas, he slaughtered villain after villain... In the arenas fans chanted his name throughout his matches.&quot;

In 1982, Piper was fired because of showing up late for a match. He went to Puerto Rico for a month and was booked by Jim Barnett shortly thereafter. Piper returned to the Georgia area in the summer of 1983 to aid Tommy Rich during his rivalry with Buzz Sawyer. Eventually, Piper moved back to Jim Crockett Promotions. As a fan favorite, Piper feuded with Sgt. Slaughter, Ric Flair, and Greg Valentine. Piper&#x27;s feud with Valentine culminated in a dog collar match at the first Starrcade. Valentine broke Piper&#x27;s left eardrum during the match, causing Piper to permanently lose 50–75% percent of his hearing. This became known as &quot;The Year of the Ear&quot;.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1979, 1984–1987) ===
==== Early appearances (1979) ====
Before entering the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) full-time in 1984, Piper wrestled five matches with the WWF under Vince McMahon Sr. in 1979 at Madison Square Garden. His first match in WWF he defeated jobber Frankie Williams on January 22. Before one match, Freddie Blassie stuffed Piper&#x27;s bagpipes with toilet paper, so they would not play in front of the Garden crowd.

==== &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; (1984–1987) ====
In 1983, WWF owner Vince McMahon contacted Piper, who insisted on serving out his contract with Jim Crockett before starting his WWF run in 1984. Piper debuted in the WWF as a manager, working with &quot;Dr. D&quot; David Schultz and &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; Paul Orndorff, but eventually Piper&#x27;s run as a manager quietly ended and he started wrestling full-time. Focusing on one of his strengths as a wrestler, the microphone, he was given his own interview segment called &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; on &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot; and &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot; in 1984, starting a run of the segment that ended in 1987. During one &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;, Piper insulted Jimmy Snuka&#x27;s Polynesian heritage and attacked Snuka by smashing him over the head with a coconut. Piper also insulted Bruno Sammartino during a &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; segment, which led to a feud that ended in a steel cage match on February 8, 1986, at the Boston Garden which Piper lost.
Piper&#x27;s next major storyline was with Hulk Hogan and also involved pop singer Cyndi Lauper. In 1985, MTV broadcast &quot;The War to Settle the Score&quot;, which featured a main-event match between Piper and Hogan for the WWF championship. Hogan was accompanied to the ring by Lauper, Captain Lou Albano, and Mr. T. This event set up the first WrestleMania, which pitted Paul Orndorff and his former manager Piper against Hogan and Mr. T. Orndorff was pinned by Hogan when Piper&#x27;s bodyguard &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton interfered and mistakenly struck Orndorff instead of Hogan. In &quot;Born to Controversy&quot;, Piper recalled how during the match he had to keep Mr. T busy to cover Mr. T&#x27;s lack of wrestling ability from being seen by the fans. From this situation, Piper and Mr. T&#x27;s real-life relationship became hostile, leading to the inevitable conclusion that they be put into a feud with one another on-screen. Piper faced Mr. T in a boxing match at WrestleMania 2 in 1986, which Piper lost by disqualification after bodyslamming Mr. T.

Following a leave of absence from the WWF, Piper returned as a face, during a TV taping of &quot;Championship Wrestling&quot; on August 23, 1986, against A. J. Petrucci. As part of the storyline, the returning Piper was distressed to find his &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; segment replaced by &quot;The Flower Shop&quot;, a segment hosted by Adrian Adonis, who had also hired Piper&#x27;s former bodyguard Orton. Piper spent weeks crashing Adonis&#x27; show and trading insults, leading to a &quot;showdown&quot; between the two segments that ended with Piper being assaulted and humiliated by Adonis, Orton, and Don Muraco and the destruction of the original Piper&#x27;s Pit set, resulting in Piper&#x27;s face turn and the construction of a more permanent Piper&#x27;s Pit set. In response, Piper stormed the set of Adonis&#x27; show and destroyed it with a baseball bat. This led to their Hair vs. Hair match at WrestleMania III, which was billed as Piper&#x27;s retirement match from wrestling before he left to become an actor full-time. Piper won the match.

In early 1987, Piper&#x27;s Pit also served as the backdrop for Andre the Giant&#x27;s heel turn and challenging Piper&#x27;s old foe, Hulk Hogan, for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania III, and Hogan ultimately accepting the challenge.

=== Return to WWF (1989–1996) ===
In 1989, Piper returned from a two-year hiatus. Although WrestleMania V was billed as his return, he actually made his first appearance on March 19 in Denver, CO at a house show when he hosted a live &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; and interviewed Brother Love. Two weeks later at WrestleMania V he did make his official return with another live &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;, where he hosed down a smoking Morton Downey Jr. with a fire extinguisher. He made his return to the ring on May 12, substituting for Jake Roberts and pinning Ted DiBiase on a house show in Los Angeles. Piper would gain several more victories against DiBiase that month, and also against Randy Savage in June.

After this, Piper co-hosted &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot; from July 17, 1989, to December 25, 1989, with Gorilla Monsoon, feuding with Bobby Heenan, &quot;Ravishing&quot; Rick Rude, and Brother Love, he would return to the show in 1991 as well. Piper returned to the ring when he interfered in Rude&#x27;s Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship defense against The Ultimate Warrior at SummerSlam, costing Rude the title. The feud was heavily promoted on TV and Piper would face Rude in many matches throughout the house show tours, including steel cage and lumberjack matches. The feud was so prominent that a Survivor Series match was built around it which saw both men captain a team and simultaneously be eliminated by countout during their brawl, though Rude&#x27;s team would go onto win the match. The feud came to a head shortly thereafter on &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot; during an on-air bet between Heenan and Piper, which Piper won, resulting in Heenan having to dress as Santa Claus during the next episode of &quot;Prime Time&quot;. The feud continued until March 1990 with Piper winning the majority of their matches throughout 89-90 including a win over Bobby Heenan.
He then feuded with Bad News Brown who was upset at being eliminated by Piper at the 1990 Royal Rumble. Brown would go on to mock Piper for wearing a &quot;skirt&quot;. At WrestleMania VI in April 1990, Piper cut a promo towards his opponent Bad News Brown before the match with half his face and body painted black, and also wrestled Bad News while painted this way. Bad News would take this display of blackface as being offensive behind the scenes. Subsequently, the match would end in a Double Count Out, with the issue between the two never being resolved despite plans to the contrary. According to a behind the scenes interview, neither man was willing to lose to the other.
In 1991, he supported Virgil in his feud against &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; (Ted DiBiase). Later in 1990 Piper was involved in a motorcycle accident, but was still present at their matches at WrestleMania VII and SummerSlam. He renewed his feud with Ric Flair and at the 1992 Royal Rumble defeated The Mountie for his first, and only, Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. He lost it soon after to Bret Hart at WrestleMania VIII. Following his title loss to Hart, Piper made a handful of appearances at television tapings for &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; and &quot;WWF Superstars.&quot; Four Piper&#x27;s Pit segments were recorded - two with Steve Lombardi and two with Shawn Michaels. None aired, and Piper disappeared from the WWF. He made his return playing the bagpipes at SummerSlam.

==== Return and &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; (1994–1996) ====
He reemerged once again in 1994 at WrestleMania X as guest referee for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between Bret Hart and Yokozuna. During the match, commentator Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler remarked that he hated Piper and continued to taunt Piper on his &quot;King&#x27;s Court&quot; segment on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, eventually culminating with Lawler bringing out a young, skinny impersonator in a Piper T-shirt and kilt and forcing him to kiss his feet. Enraged, Piper agreed to wrestle Lawler at the King of the Ring, where Piper emerged victorious. Piper wrestled as a fan favorite, and adding to the face attitude by donating part of his purse from the fight with Lawler to a children&#x27;s hospital in Ontario. In spring 1994, Piper began hosting a regular weekly segment on &quot;All-American Wrestling&quot; called &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; where he commented on various happenings in the WWF, as well as on his feud with Lawler. Piper&#x27;s segment aired regularly until the Summer of 1994, when Piper would disappear again.

Leaving the WWF again, he briefly returned in 1995 at WrestleMania XI, once again in a referee capacity, for the submission-only match between Hart and Bob Backlund. After this match Piper became the host for the replay editions of WWF pay-per-views for a brief period of time, commenting on the matches that had just happened, before disappearing again a few months later.

==== President of the WWF (1996) ====
On the January 29, 1996, episode of &quot;Monday Night RAW&quot;, Piper returned for another regular role: he was named as interim WWF President after Gorilla Monsoon had to take a leave of absence due to an attack by Vader. On February 24, at a house show at East Rutherford, New Jersey, he made his first match appearance in almost two years. As a substitute for Razor Ramon, Piper defeated The 1-2-3 Kid after hitting him with a ring bell. He wrestled twice more against the Kid on house shows that month.

As president, one of Piper&#x27;s first acts was to reinstate The Ultimate Warrior back into the WWF after a letter campaign written in by fans. Piper had become the object of affection for Goldust. Enraged, Piper claimed he would &quot;make a man&quot; out of Goldust at WrestleMania XII. The match, dubbed a &quot;Hollywood Backlot Brawl&quot;, began in a pre-taped segment, recorded in an alleyway, but Goldust jumped into his gold Cadillac and ran Piper over, ultimately escaping (allegedly) onto the highways of Anaheim. Piper pursued in his white Ford Bronco, the aerial footage shown was actually that of the O. J. Simpson &quot;low-speed&quot; chase from two years prior. This was made clear by Piper himself, who recalled the event on an episode of &quot;Pipers Pit the Podcast&quot;. The two eventually arrived at the arena, where Piper disrobed Goldust in the ring, effectively ending the confrontation. With Gorilla Monsoon back in control of the WWF by the end of the night, Piper once again left the company. His final appearance came the September 6, 1996, edition of &quot;Monday Night RAW&quot;, where footage was shown of him participating with other WWF wrestlers at the CNE &quot;Experience&quot; in Toronto.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1996–2000) ===
==== Feuding with nWo (1996–1998) ====
Piper joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the fall of 1996. He made his surprise WCW debut as a fan favorite at the Halloween Havoc pay-per-view in October to insult the nWo leader and the World Heavyweight Champion Hollywood Hogan.
On the November 18 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Piper revealed that Eric Bischoff was a member of the nWo, which ended with the nWo members attacking him. on the December 9 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Piper told Flair that he didn&#x27;t need the Four Horsemen&#x27;s help in beating Hogan and he was going to do it on his own. Piper defeated Hogan with his signature sleeper hold in the non-title main event of the company&#x27;s flagship pay-per-view Starrcade, which earned him a title shot against Hogan for the World Heavyweight Championship at SuperBrawl VII, where Piper was defeated. On the March 10, 1997, episode of Nitro, Piper and his family joined forces with Ric Flair and The Four Horsemen in their battle with the nWo. At Uncensored, Piper competed in a triangle elimination match where he captained a team of Horsemen Chris Benoit, Steve McMichael and Jeff Jarrett against the nWo and WCW&#x27;s team of Lex Luger, Steiner Brothers and The Giant. His team lost the match. On the March 31 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Piper and Flair agreed to team up and stand side by side to fight. Piper moved on to feud with other members of nWo. At Slamboree, Piper, Flair and Kevin Greene defeated nWo members Scott Hall, Kevin Nash and Syxx in a six-man tag team match. The following month, at The Great American Bash pay-per-view, Piper and Flair unsuccessfully challenged The Outsiders for the World Tag Team Championship. on the June 23 episode of Nitro, Flair and the Four Horsemen turned on Piper and attacked him. This led to a match between Piper and Flair at Bash at the Beach, which Piper won.

Piper took a hiatus from television before making his return to WCW on the September 8 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, where he was appointed the new on-air Commissioner of WCW, which reduced his in-ring work. He briefly resumed his feud with Hulk Hogan, beating him in a steel cage match at Halloween Havoc. on the March 23, 1998, episode of Nitro, Piper and Randy Savage battled to a no contest. On the March 30 episode of Nitro, Piper defeated Hogan by disqualification. At the 1998 Spring Stampede pay-per-view, Piper teamed with The Giant in a loss to Hogan and Nash in a Baseball Bat on a Pole match. At Slamboree, Piper served as the special guest referee in a match between Randy Savage and Bret Hart, which Hart won but the following night on Nitro, Piper changed his decision and declared Savage as the winner by disqualification. At The Great American Bash, Piper and Savage lost to Hogan and Hart in a tag team match by submission. After the match, Piper wrestled Savage in the next match, which Piper defeated Savage by submission. On the September 7 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Piper and Diamond Dallas Page defeated Sting and Lex Luger by disqualification. Piper teamed with Diamond Dallas Page and The Warrior as Team WCW in a WarGames match at Fall Brawl for an opportunity at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at the following month&#x27;s Halloween Havoc. Page won the match for his team. On the September 14 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Piper confronted Bret Hart.

==== Various storylines and departure (1999–2000) ====
On the February 8, 1999, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Piper defeated Bret Hart to win his third United States Heavyweight Championship; the first two reigns being in JCP. Piper held the title for only two weeks as he lost the title to Scott Hall at SuperBrawl IX. At Slamboree, Piper defeated Flair by disqualification after Eric Bischoff reversed Flair&#x27;s pinfall win, disqualifying Flair for hitting Piper with a foreign object (which had been ignored by biased referee Charles Robinson). 8 days later on the May 17 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Piper called out Bischoff for what Bischoff did to him in 1996, before Bischoff apologised to him and WCW fans. Piper and Bischoff were interrupted by Randy Savage and his Team Madness, before Savage and Team Madness attacked him and Bischoff until Kevin Nash saved him and Bischoff. The following month later at The Great American Bash, Flair defeated Piper by disqualification for control of WCW after interference from Buff Bagwell. Upset with Bagwell getting him disqualified, Piper knocked Bagwell out and joined Flair as vice president, turning Piper heel for the first time in WCW. At Bash at the Beach, Piper competed against Bagwell in a boxing match with Mills Lane as special guest referee which he lost. In late 1999, Piper returned to WCW programming as a face, in an angle with Vince Russo, who was now portraying himself as the &quot;Powers That Be&quot; (an unseen power that was controlling WCW). At Starrcade, Piper was the special referee in the WCW World Heavyweight Championship match featuring Goldberg and Hart. Forced by Russo, Piper called for the bell when Hart locked in the Sharpshooter on Goldberg, when it was apparent that Goldberg had not submitted. The feud between Piper and the Powers That Be ended shortly after. Piper&#x27;s last appearance in WCW was at SuperBrawl 2000 in February 2000 where he was a surprise referee in the WCW World Heavyweight Championship match between Sid Vicious, Jeff Jarrett and Scott Hall. In July 2000, WCW terminated Piper&#x27;s contract.

===Xcitement Wrestling Federation (2001–2002)===
Before going to the WWE in 2003, Piper served as the commissioner of the Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF). On November 5, 2002, Piper revealed in his autobiography, &quot;In the Pit with Piper: Roddy Gets Rowdy&quot;, that he was released rather than having left as had previously been thought.

=== Return to WWE (2003) ===
Piper returned to WWE on March 30, 2003, by conducting a surprise run in during the Hulk Hogan-Vince McMahon match at WrestleMania XIX in Seattle, Washington, where he attacked Hogan with a steel pipe to cement his heel status; Hogan nevertheless eventually won the match. Piper went on to align with Sean O&#x27;Haire; at Backlash in April, Rikishi hit Piper with Piper&#x27;s own coconut, but this led to O&#x27;Haire defeating Rikishi.

In May, as Hulk Hogan had been banned in storyline from television by Vince McMahon, Hogan returned under a mask as Mr. America, and continued his feud with Piper, O&#x27;Haire and McMahon, who tried to reveal Mr. America&#x27;s true identity. This storyline also saw Piper tear off the fake leg of one-legged wrestler Zach Gowen, who was playing a Hogan fan. At Judgment Day, Piper argued with Chris Jericho if &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; was better than Jericho&#x27;s talk show &quot;The Highlight Reel&quot;. Later at the event, Piper lost to Mr. America.

Piper and O&#x27;Haire then moved on to challenge Tajiri and Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but in June 2003, WWE fired Piper after a controversial interview with HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; in which Piper discussed the darker side of the wrestling industry. WWE cited that &quot;Piper stated that he used drugs for many years while working in professional wrestling and that he does not like the person that he becomes when he actively performs as a professional wrestler&quot;, and dismissed Piper because of &quot;inability to reach agreement on a contract and to assist Piper from engaging in any self-destructive behavior&quot;. On his 2006 DVD, Piper claimed that HBO took parts of his interviews out of context to make wrestling look bad.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2005) ===

He also appeared the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; as one of the Legend Lumberjacks in a match that involved Christian and Ted DiBiase.

In November 2008, a video spread around the internet showing Toombs smoking marijuana and taking a hit from a bong in front of a cheering crowd at the annual Gathering of the Juggalos, although he later acknowledged his use of medicinal marijuana &quot;to alleviate the symptoms associated with cancer&quot;. This was reiterated on a blog from Jim Ross.

In his autobiography, Toombs claimed to be a cousin of Bret Hart, which would make him a relative of the Hart wrestling family. This fact was once used as a trivia question on &quot;Raw&quot;. Hart also revealed that Toombs was the only wrestler to visit him in the hospital after his stroke. Bruce Hart has stated that they were second cousins.

== Death ==

On July 24, 2015, Piper appeared as a guest on &quot;The Rich Eisen Show&quot;. He had trouble collecting his thoughts and staying focused, often rambling and not answering Eisen&#x27;s questions.

One week later on July 31, 2015, Piper died in his sleep at the age of 61 at his summer residence in Los Angeles, California. His death certificate cites a cardiopulmonary arrest caused by hypertension, listing a pulmonary embolism as a contributing factor; &quot;TMZ&quot; reported this as a heart attack caused by the embolism. Piper&#x27;s long-time friend Bruce Prichard revealed on his podcast that he received a voicemail from Piper the night of his death.

News of his death broke minutes before the Hall of Heroes dinner to cap off the Mid-Atlantic Wrestling Legends FanFest in Charlotte, North Carolina, where about 600 current and former wrestling personalities and fans had gathered. He received a ten-bell salute after the planned salute to fellow former professional wrestler Dusty Rhodes, who had died the previous month. Another ten-bell salute was given at the beginning of the August 3, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

WWE CEO Vince McMahon said, &quot;Roddy Piper was one of the most entertaining, controversial and bombastic performers ever in WWE, beloved by millions of fans around the world. I extend my deepest condolences to his family.&quot; Film director John Carpenter said, &quot;Devastated to hear the news of my friend Roddy Piper&#x27;s passing today. He was a great wrestler, a masterful entertainer and a good friend.&quot;

In an HBO &quot;Real Sports&quot; interview conducted by Piper in 2003, he had predicted that he was &quot;not going to make 65&quot; because of his poor health, and that he made his 2003 return to WWE because he could not access his pension fund until reaching the age of 65.

Piper was cremated and his ashes interred at Crescent Grove Cemetery in Tigard, Oregon.

== Legacy ==

Piper is considered one of the greatest talkers and heels in wrestling history. &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot; interview segments were considered innovative, especially in an atmosphere where only the people like the world champion got to talk, and the wrestlers were the interviewees—never the interviewers. According to Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan, he could just leave Piper in a room and return twenty minutes later with Piper having done a class-A promo. WWE named him the greatest villain in wrestling history.

Dave Meltzer of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; described Piper as &quot;one of the key figures in the growth of WWF. In particular, he helped power the success of the first WrestleMania: the most important show in company history&quot;.

Piper was one of the first wrestlers to have his entrance music played by a live band. At the War to Settle the Score in February 1985 before his WWF Title match with Hulk Hogan at Madison Square Garden, Piper&#x27;s theme was played by the NYPD Pipes and Drums out to the ring.

Mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey was nicknamed &quot;Rowdy&quot; by her friends. She initially rejected using it professionally, feeling it might disrespect Piper. After being introduced to him through Gene LeBell, Piper gave her his approval to use the nickname. On the day of his death, she dedicated her next day&#x27;s UFC 190 title match with Bethe Correia to him. After quickly winning it, she noted him first in her post-fight interview. In 2018, when Rousey made her full-time WWE debut, she wore the jacket that Piper wore, which was given to her by his son. She also used a move called &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit,&quot; a reference to the talkshow he held during the WWF.

In April 2019, Piper was honored with a statue as part of WrestleMania Axxess in Brooklyn, New York.

<doc id="405195" wikidata="Q185518" url="?curid=405195" title="Mandalay">
<text>Mandalay ( or ; ) is the second-largest city in Myanmar, after Yangon. Located on the east bank of the Irrawaddy River, 631 km (392 miles; road distance) north of Yangon, the city has a population of 1,225,553 (2014 census).

Mandalay was founded in 1857 by King Mindon, replacing Amarapura as the new royal capital of the Konbaung dynasty. It was Burma&#x27;s final royal capital before the kingdom&#x27;s annexation by the British Empire in 1885. Under British rule, Mandalay remained commercially and culturally important despite the rise of Yangon, the new capital of British Burma. The city suffered extensive destruction during the Japanese conquest of Burma in the Second World War. In 1948, Mandalay became part of the newly independent Union of Burma.

Today, Mandalay is the economic centre of Upper Myanmar and considered the centre of Burmese culture. A continuing influx of irregular Chinese immigrants, mostly from Yunnan, since the late 20th century, has reshaped the city&#x27;s ethnic makeup and increased commerce with China. Despite Naypyidaw&#x27;s recent rise, Mandalay remains Upper Myanmar&#x27;s main commercial, educational and health center.

==Etymology==
The city gets its name from the nearby Mandalay Hill. The name is probably a derivative of a Pali word, although the exact word of origin remains unclear. The root word has been speculated to be &quot;&quot; (မဏ္ဍလ), referring to circular plains or &quot;Mandara&quot;, a mountain from Hindu mythology.

When it was founded in 1857, the royal city was officially named Yadanarbon (, ), a loan of the Pali name Ratanapūra () &quot;City of Gems.&quot; It was also called &quot;Lay Kyun Aung Myei&quot; (, , &quot;Victorious Land over the Four Islands&quot;) and Mandalay Palace (, , &quot;Famed Royal Emerald Palace&quot;).

==History==
===Early history===

Like most former (and present) capitals of Burma, Mandalay was founded on the wishes of the ruler of the day. On 13 February 1857, King Mindon founded a new royal capital at the foot of Mandalay Hill, ostensibly to fulfill a prophecy on the founding of a metropolis of Buddhism in that exact place on the occasion of the 2,400th jubilee of Buddhism.The new capital city site was in area, surrounded by four rivers. The plan called for a 144-square block grid patterned citadel, anchored by a 16 square block royal palace compound at the center by Mandalay Hill. The 1,020-acre (413-hectare) citadel was surrounded by four long walls and a moat wide, deep. At intervals of along the wall, were turrets with gold-tipped spires for watchmen. The walls had three gates on each side, and five bridges to cross the moat. In addition, the king also commissioned the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the &quot;Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein&quot; Ordination Hall, the &quot;Thudamma&quot; zayats or public houses for preaching Buddhism and a library for the Pāli Canon.

In June 1857, the former royal palace of Amarapura was dismantled and moved by elephants to the new location at the foot of Mandalay Hill, although construction of the palace compound was officially completed only two years later, on Monday, 23 May 1859.

For the next 26 years, Mandalay was to be the last royal capital of the Konbaung dynasty, the last independent Burmese kingdom before its final annexation by the British Empire. Mandalay ceased to be the capital on 28 November 1885 when the British conquered the city and sent Thibaw Min and his queen Supayalat into exile in India. Moreover, a group of drunken soldiers set fire to the Pitakataik (Royal Library) which had contained the genealogies of kings and the kingdom&#x27;s official records. Mandalay was razed. However, the palace, its structures and the city walls were spared destruction.

===Colonial Mandalay (1885–1948)===

While Mandalay would continue to be the chief city of Upper Burma during the British colonial rule, the commercial and political importance had irreversibly shifted to Yangon. The British view on the development of Mandalay (and Burma) was mainly with commercial intentions. While rail transport reached Mandalay in 1889, less than four years after the annexation, the first college in Mandalay, Mandalay College, was not established until 40 years later, in 1925. The British looted the palace, with some of the treasures going on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum; in 1964 they were returned to Burma as a gesture of goodwill. The British also renamed the palace compound Fort Dufferin and used it to billet troops.

Throughout the colonial years, Mandalay was the centre of Burmese culture and Buddhist learning, and as the last royal capital, was regarded by the Burmese as a primary symbol of sovereignty and identity. Between the two World Wars, the city was Upper Burma&#x27;s focal point in a series of nationwide protests against the British rule. The British rule brought in many immigrants from India to the city. In 1904–1905, a plague caused about one-third of the population to flee the city.
During World War II, Mandalay suffered devastating air raids. On 3 April 1942, during the Japanese conquest of Burma, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service carried out an extensive assault. The city was in effect defenseless as its firefighting resources were weak, having been lost in earlier bombing, it had no anti-aircraft capacity, and the British RAF had by now withdrawn all its aircraft to India. Three-fifths of Mandalay&#x27;s houses were destroyed and 2,000 civilians were killed. Many residents also fled when the city was under Japanese occupation from May 1942 to March 1945. The palace citadel, which had been turned into a supply depot by the Japanese, was in turn burnt to the ground by Allied bombing; only the royal mint and the watch tower survived. (A faithful replica of the palace was rebuilt in the 1990s.)

===Contemporary Mandalay (1948–present)===
After the country gained independence from Britain in 1948, Mandalay continued to be the main cultural, educational and economic hub of Upper Burma. Until the early 1990s, most students from Upper Burma went to Mandalay for university education. Until 1991, Mandalay University, the University of Medicine, Mandalay and the Defence Services Academy were the only three universities in Upper Burma. Only a few other cities had &quot;Degree Colleges&quot; affiliated with Mandalay University that offered a limited number of subjects. Today, the city attracts a fraction of students as the military government requires students to attend their local universities in order to reduce concentration of students in one place.

In November 1959, Mandalay celebrated its centennial with a festival at the foot of Mandalay Hill. Special commemorative stamps were issued.

During Ne Win&#x27;s isolationist rule (1962–1988), the city&#x27;s infrastructure deteriorated. By the early 1980s, the second largest city of Burma resembled a town with low-rise buildings and dusty streets filled mostly with bicycles. In the 1980s, the city was hit by two major fires. In May 1981, a fire razed more than 6,000 houses and public buildings, leaving more than 90,000 homeless. On 24 March 1984, another fire destroyed 2,700 buildings and made 23,000 people homeless. The fire caused US$96 million in property damage.

Fires continue to plague the city. A major fire destroyed Mandalay&#x27;s second largest market, Yadanabon Market, in February 2008, and another major fire in February 2009 destroyed 320 homes and left over 1600 people homeless.

=== Illegal Chinese immigration ===
The 1980s fires augured a significant change in the city&#x27;s physical character and ethnic makeup. Huge swaths of land left vacant by the fires were later purchased, mostly by the ethnic Han Chinese, many of whom were recent immigrants from Yunnan. The Chinese influx accelerated after the State Peace and Development Council came to power in 1988. Many Chinese immigrants from Yunnan and, to a lesser extent, Sichuan poured into Upper Burma in the 1990s and many ending up in Mandalay, living illegally there. In the 1990s alone, about 250,000 to 300,000 Yunnanese are estimated to have migrated to Mandalay. Today, ethnic Chinese people are believed to make up about 40%–50% of the city&#x27;s population that is nearly the same as the natives, and are a major factor in the city&#x27;s doubling of population from about 500,000 in 1980 to one million in 2008. Chinese festivals are now firmly embedded in the city&#x27;s cultural calendar. The Chinese dominance in the city center has pushed out the rest to the suburbs. The urban sprawl now encompasses Amarapura, the very city King Mindon left some 150 years ago. Mandalay celebrated its 150th birthday on 15 May 2009, at precisely 4:31:36 am.

Despite the rise of Naypyidaw, the country&#x27;s capital since 2006, Mandalay remains Upper Burma&#x27;s main commercial, educational and health center. In October 2018, Mandalay was ranked by CIO Asia as number fifth among the top 10 cities in Southeast Asia in the process of becoming a smart city for ASEAN Smart Cities Network.

==Geography==

Mandalay is located in the central Dry Zone of Burma by the Irrawaddy river at 21.98° North, 96.08° East, 80 meters (260 feet) above sea level. Its standard time zone is UTC/GMT +6:30 hours and is 626 km from Yangon.

Mandalay lies along the Sagaing Fault, a tectonic plate boundary between the India and Sunda plates. The biggest earthquake in its history occurred on 23 March 1839, when an estimated magnitude 8.2 destroyed the former capital Ava and caused extreme destruction in nearby cities. The most recent quake was a magnitude of 7, occurred in 1956. The devastation was greatest in nearby Sagaing, and it came to be known as the Great Sagaing Quake.

Bodies of water near Mandalay are Mandalay Kantawgyi, a small lake and Irrawaddy River to the west of the city.

==Climate==
Although the rain shadow of the Arakan Mountains is powerful, the city qualifies as having a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Aw&quot;), bordering a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), though if using 1981-2010 data, Mandalay does qualify as hot semi-arid (&quot;BSh&quot;).

Mandalay features noticeably warmer and cooler periods of the year. Average temperatures in January, the mildest month, hovers around while the hottest month, April, averages . Mandalay is very hot in the months of April and May, with average high temperatures easily exceeding . It is not uncommon to see high temperatures surpass during these two months in the city. Mandalay also features wet and dry seasons of nearly equal length, with the wet season running from May through October and the dry season covering the remaining six months. The highest reliably recorded temperature in Mandalay is on 12 May 2010 while the lowest is on 26 December 1999. There is considerably more diurnal temperature variation in the dry season than the wet season.


==Cityscape==
===Around the city===

* Atumashi Monastery: The &quot;Atumashi kyaung&quot;, which literally means &quot;inimitable vihara&quot;, is also one of the well known sights. The original structure was destroyed by a fire in 1890 though the masonry plinth survived. The reconstruction project was started by the government on 2 May 1995 and completed in June 1996.
* Buddha&#x27;s Replica Tooth Relic Pagoda: One of the Buddha&#x27;s Sacred Replica Tooth Relics was enshrined in the Mandalay Swedaw Pagoda on Maha Dhammayanthi Hill in Amarapura Township. The pagoda was built with cash donations contributed by the peoples of Burma and Buddhist donors from around the world under the supervision of the State Peace and Development Council. The authorities and donors hoisted Buddha&#x27;s Replica Tooth Relic Pagoda Mandalay&#x27;s &quot;Shwe Htidaw&quot; (sacred golden umbrella), &quot;Hngetmyatnadaw&quot; (sacred bird perch vane) and &quot;Seinhpudaw&quot; (sacred diamond bud) on 13 December 1996.
* Kuthodaw Pagoda (The World&#x27;s Biggest Book): Built by King Mindon in 1857, this pagoda modeled on the Shwezigon Pagoda at Nyaung-U, is surrounded by 729 upright stone slabs on which are inscribed the entire &quot;Tipiṭaka&quot; as edited and approved by the Fifth Buddhist council. It is popularly known as &quot;World&#x27;s largest book&quot; for its stone scriptures.
* Kyauktawgyi Pagoda: Near the southern approach to Mandalay Hill stands the Kyauktawgyi Buddha image built by King Mindon in 1853–78. The Image was carved out of a huge single block of marble. Statues of 80 arahants are assembled around the Image, twenty on each side. The carving was completed in 1865.
* Mahamuni Buddha Temple: The image of Gautama Buddha at Mahamuni Buddha Temple is said to have been cast in the life-time of the Gautama Buddha and that the Buddha embraced it seven times, thereby bringing it to life. Consequently, devout Buddhists hold it to be alive and refer to it as the Mahamuni Sacred Living Image. Revered as the holiest pagoda in Mandalay, It was built by King Bodawpaya in 1784. The image in a sitting posture is 12 feet and 7 inches (3.8 m) high. As the image was brought from Rakhine State, it was also called the Great Rakhine Buddha. The early morning ritual of washing the Face of Buddha Image draws a large crowd of devotees every day.
* Mandalay Hill: The hill has for long been a holy mount. Legend has it that the Buddha, on his visit, had prophesied that a great city would be founded at its foot. Mandalay Hill, 230 metres high, provides a view of the city and surrounding countryside. The construction of a motor road to reach the hill-top has already been finished.
* Mandalay Palace: The whole palace complex was destroyed by a fire during World War II. The palace walls, the city gates with their crowning wooden pavilions and the surrounding moat, &quot;Mya-nan-san-kyaw Shwenandaw&quot;, were rebuilt using forced labor. A model of the Mandalay Palace, Nanmyint-saung and Mandalay Cultural Museum are located inside the palace grounds.

* Shwenandaw Monastery: known for its wood carvings, it was a part of the old palace. In 1880 it was moved by King Thibaw to its current site close to Atumashi Monastery.
*U Bein Bridge : known for the oldest and (once) longest teakwood bridge in the world. It was constructed when the capital of Ava Kingdom moved to Amarapura .
* Yadanabon Zoological Gardens: A small zoo between the Mandalay Palace and Mandalay Hill. It has over 300 species and is notably the only zoo to have Burmese roofed turtles.

==Administration==

The Mandalay Region Government is the government for Mandalay Region including Mandalay City. The Mandalay City Development Committee (MCDC) is municipal organization for Mandalay City. The Mandalay District consists of seven townships.
*Amarapura
*Aungmyethazan
*Chanayethazan (city centre)
*Chanmyathazi
*Maha Aungmye
*Patheingyi
*Pyigyidagun

==Transport==
Mandalay&#x27;s strategic location in Central Burma makes it an important hub for transport of people and goods. The city is connected to other parts of the country and to China and India by multiple modes of transportation.

===Air===

Mandalay International Airport (MDL) was one of the largest and most modern airports in Myanmar until the modernization of Yangon International Airport in 2008. Built at a cost of US$150 million in 2000, it is highly underused; it serves mostly domestic flights with the exception of those to Kunming and to/from Bangkok and Chiang Mai, with daily flights on Air Asia and Bangkok Airways. The airport has come to represent the military regime&#x27;s propensity for bad planning and penchant for white elephant projects. Myanmar&#x27;s recent opening stance on tourism means the airport is now receiving a growing number of visitors from Bangkok and Chiang Mai.

The airport is far from the city, on a modern highway. Before the construction of this airport, Mandalay Chanmyathazi Airport was the main airport of the city. The airport serves some flights to Myanmar towns.

===River===
The Ayeyarwady River remains an important arterial route for transporting goods such as farm produce including rice, beans and pulses, cooking oil, pottery, bamboo and teak.

===Rail===

Mandalay Central Railway Station is the terminus of Myanmar Railways&#x27;s metre gauge main rail line from Yangon (Yangon–Mandalay Railway) and the starting point of branch lines to Pyin U Lwin (Maymyo), Lashio (Mandalay–Lashio Railway), Monywa, Pakokku, Kalay, Gangaw, and to the north, Shwebo, Kawlin, Naba, Kanbalu, Mohnyin, Hopin, Mogaung and Myitkyina (Mandalay–Myitkyina Railway).

Mandalay has a station on the standard gauge Kunming, China - Kyaukphyu port railway.

Mandalay does not have an intra-city metro rail system. The former Trams in Mandalay has been decommissioned.

===Roads===
Mandalay literally is at the center of Burma&#x27;s road network. The highway network includes roads towards:
* Upper Burma and China—Mandalay–Tagaung–Bhamo–Myitkyina Road, Mandalay–Mogok–Singu–Bhamo Road, Mandalay–Lashio–Muse Road (part of Asian Highway route 14 or AH14)
* Western Burma and India—Mandalay–Sagaing–Monywa–Kalewa–Tamu Road
* Lower Burma– Yangon-Mandalay Expressway and AH1

Most stretches of these highways are one-lane roads in poor condition.

===Buses and cars===
As the government allows only a few thousands of vehicles to be imported each year, motor transportation in Burma is highly expensive for most of its citizens. Most people rely on bicycles, motorcycles and/or private and public buses to get around. Back in the 2000s, the most popular car in Mandalay was the 1982/83 Nissan Sunny pickup truck. Because of its utility as a private bus or taxi, the two-and-a-half-decade old model still had strong demand and heady prices to match—from K10 million to K14 million (US$8,000 to US$11,000) in mid-2008. To get around severe import limits, people of Mandalay had turned to illegally imported and hence unregistered (called &quot;without&quot; in Burmese English) motorcycles and cars despite the government&#x27;s periodic confiscation sprees then.

In March 2008, Mandalay had nearly 81,000 registered motor vehicles plus an unknown number of unregistered vehicles. Although the number of cars in a city of one million is low, traffic in Mandalay is highly chaotic as thousands of bicycles and (unregistered) motorbikes freely roam around all the lanes of the streets. Unlike in Yangon where motorbikes, cycle rickshaws and bicycles are prohibited from entering downtown and busy areas, in Mandalay it is anything goes. In 2018, as part of Mandalay Smart City initiatives, new traffic lights with internet-connected sensors have been installed by Mandalay City Development Committee to manage traffic at junctions.

==Demographics==
A 2007 estimate by the UN puts Mandalay&#x27;s population at nearly 1 million. The city&#x27;s population is projected to reach nearly 1.5 million by 2025. While Mandalay has traditionally been the bastion of Bamar (Burman) culture and populace, the massive influx of illegal ethnic Han Chinese in the last 20 years has effectively influenced the ethnic Bamar majority there. Although many native ethnic Han Chinese could not get Burmese citizenship, the foreign-born Yunnanese can easily obtain Burmese citizenship cards on the black market. Ludu Daw Amar of Mandalay, the native journalist had said it felt like &quot;an undeclared colony of Yunnan&quot;. Today, the percentage of ethnic Han Chinese, estimated at 50% of the city (with the Yunnanese forming an estimated 30% of Mandalay&#x27;s population), is believed to be nearly the same as that of the ethnic Bamar. A sizable community of Indian immigrants (mostly Tamils) also resides in Mandalay.

Burmese is the principal language of the city, while Chinese is increasingly heard in the city&#x27;s commerce centers as the second language. English is the third language, only known by some urban people.

==Culture==

Mandalay is Burma&#x27;s cultural and religious center of Buddhism, having numerous monasteries and more than 700 pagodas. At the foot of Mandalay Hill sits the world&#x27;s official &quot;Buddhist Bible&quot;, also known as the world&#x27;s largest book, in Kuthodaw Pagoda. The styles of Mandalay Buddha Images and Buddha Statues were many since King Mandon, who was a devout Buddhist, and had filled Mandalay with them and through the years Mandalay Buddhist art became established as the pure art of Myanmar. There are 729 slabs of stone that together are inscribed with the entire Pāli Canon, each housed in its own white stupa.

The buildings inside the old Mandalay city walls, surrounded by a moat, which was repaired in recent times using prison labor, comprise the Mandalay Palace, mostly destroyed during World War II. İt is now replaced by a replica, military Prison and a military garrison, the headquarters of the Central Military Command.

===Media===
Much of the media in Mandalay – like elsewhere in Burma – comes from Yangon. The city&#x27;s non-satellite TV programming comes from Yangon-based state-run TV Myanmar and military-run Myawaddy, both of which provide Burmese language news and entertainment. Since December 2006, MRTV-4, formerly a paid channel, has also been available in Mandalay. Mandalay has two radio stations. Naypyidaw-based Myanmar Radio National Service is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in Burmese (and in English during specific times.) Semi-state-run Mandalay City FM (87.9FM) is the Mandalay metropolitan area&#x27;s pop culture oriented station.

The military government, which controls all daily newspapers in Burma, uses Mandalay to publish and distribute its three national newspapers, the Burmese language &quot;Myanmar Alin&quot; and &quot;Kyemon&quot; and the English language &quot;New Light of Myanmar&quot;. The state-run &quot;Yadanabon&quot; is published in Mandalay and serves the Upper Burma market.
The &quot;Mandalay Daily&quot; newspaper is published by Mandalay City Development Committee since 30 November 1997.

==Sports==

Mandalay&#x27;s sporting facilities are quite poor by international standards but are still the best in Upper Burma. The 17,000 seat Bahtoo Stadium was the largest in Upper Myanmar before the construction of Mandalarthiri Stadium and hosts mainly local and regional association football and track-and-field tournaments. Since May 2009, professional football has arrived in Mandalay, with Yadanabon FC representing the city in the newly formed Myanmar National League, the country&#x27;s first professional football league.
In 2013, a new stadium, Mandalarthiri Stadium was built to host the Women Football matches of 27th SEA Games and became the largest stadium in Mandalay and Upper Myanmar.

===Sport climbing===
At Waterfall Hill, the first bolted rock climbing site in Myanmar have been developed with the help of Mandalay climbers led by Steve, Tylor and Technical Climbing Club of Myanmar since 2010.


==Economy==

Mandalay is the major trading and communications center for Upper Myanmar. Much of Burmese external trade to China and India goes through Mandalay.

Among the leading traditional industries are silk weaving, tapestry, jade cutting and polishing, stone and wood carving, making marble and bronze Buddha images, temple ornaments and paraphernalia, the working of gold leaves and of silver, the manufacture of matches, brewing and distilling.

Since the country&#x27;s post-1988 shift towards economic liberalization, large numbers of Chinese migrants in search of economic opportunity have poured into Mandalay. These migrants brought with them talent, skills, goods and services, and capital, but also purchased most of the shops and real estate in the centre of Mandalay, transforming the economic dynamics of the city. This influx of poor Han Chinese immigrants mostly trace their ancestry to the Southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan. Many were able to illegally obtain identity papers on the black market to become naturalized Burmese citizens overnight. Arriving impoverished, they now sit at the helm of the Burmese economy as a prosperous business community. Identity cards allowed the Chinese immigrants to stay indefinitely and bypass legal barriers on foreign ownership of businesses such as hotels, shops, and restaurants.

The imposition of sanctions by the United States and the European Union in the 1990s and Burma&#x27;s open-door immigration policy in the 1990s encouraged Chinese entrepreneurs to move to Mandalay. A substantial increase in foreign direct investment has poured in from mainland China, mostly ending up in Mandalay&#x27;s real estate sector, through Burmese citizen intermediaries of Chinese ancestry. Retail outlets were opened by Chinese entrepreneurs, ranging from cement mixing to financial services turning Mandalay into the prosperous business centre it is today.
 As Mandalay became more economically prosperous, existing Burmese Chinese have facilitated continued immigration from China. The transformation of Mandalay into a booming modern metropolis filled with foreign businesses and gem trading centers occurred under the auspices of the entrepreneurial Chinese minority.

The Chinese minority in Mandalay own virtually all of Mandalay&#x27;s retail gold shops, mining concessions, foreign businesses and timber trading companies. In Central Mandalay, about 80 percent or four out of five gold and jewellery shops are Chinese-owned. Many Chinese-owned and operated businesses such as trading cooperatives, market stalls, food joints, traditional Chinese medicinal clinics, hotels, gemstone mining concessions, wholesale marketing, hotels, restaurants, and real estate have also flourished. Foreign purchasers of jade and gems flock to the city of Mandalay, with clients from Hong Kong continuing to be the source of main customers. Mandalay has been virtually sinicized economically and culturally, to the resentment of locals. More than 50 percent of the commercial business activity generated in Downtown Mandalay is derived from the eclipsing plethora of Chinese-owned shops, hotels, restaurants, and showrooms that predominate the area. About 80 percent of the hotels and guesthouses, more than 70 percent of the restaurants, more than 45 percent of gold and jewellery shops, about 30 percent of jade and gemstone trading, and nearly 100 percent of the sale centres for mainland Chinese-made commodities in Mandalay are owned and operated by the Chinese. Chinese entrepreneurs and investors have acquired much of Central Mandalay&#x27;s economic crown jewels and have been disproportionately responsible for generating much of the city&#x27;s output of commercial business activity relative to their small population size.

Prime residential and commercial real estate in central Mandalay have been bought by wealthy Chinese businessmen and investors. As many as half of the city&#x27;s residents have Chinese ancestry with the seven of the top ten entrepreneurs in Mandalay being of Chinese descent fully controlling 60 percent of its entire economy. About 50 percent of the land plots in Downtown Mandalay are controlled by the Chinese. In addition, all of Mandalay&#x27;s shopping malls and hotels were entirely built by Chinese-owned construction and real estate development companies. Besides Mandalay&#x27;s economic development being shaped by the Burmese Chinese business community&#x27;s immense development output, it has also been amplified with additional investment from foreign Chinese investment from mainland China and overseas bamboo networks. The apparent influence of mainland China is also ostensibly felt throughout the city, where the local inhabitants have alluded to Mandalay as a &quot;Chinese city&quot; dominated by an inflow of international expatriate mainland and overseas Chinese capital, with much of it invested in real estate, including hotels and restaurants.

Most new immigrants from China in recent times move to Mandalay for business, and did not intend to settle there. Being poorer, they rely on Burmese Chinese already in Mandalay helping them negotiate the local economic landscape. These &quot;new Chinese&quot; tend to settle outside Mandalay, as the central city&#x27;s Burmese Chinese areas are too expensive for them. These areas become new Chinese neighbourhoods as they develop and are recognisably distinct from the older Chinese quarters. The cultural attitudes of Chinese businesspeople in Mandalay who view local Burmese to easy-going fuel tensions with local Burmese perceive the Chinese as condescending.

Mandalay&#x27;s other major industries include sports where the nation&#x27;s popularity of soccer has sprung across the city. The Burmese soccer club, Yadanabon FC represents the city in the Myanmar National League, making it the nation&#x27;s first professional soccer league.

==Education==
Mandalay has the best educational facilities and institutions, after Yangon, in Burma where state spending on education is among the lowest in the world. Students in poor districts routinely drop out in middle school as schools have to rely on forced &quot;donations&quot; and various fees from parents for nearly everything – school maintenance to teachers&#x27; salaries.
For the rest of the students who cannot afford to go abroad for studies, Mandalay offers Upper Burma&#x27;s best institutions of higher education. There are over 15 universities in the city. The city&#x27;s University of Mandalay, University of Medicine, Mandalay, University of Dental Medicine, Mandalay, Mandalay Technological University and University of Computer Studies, Mandalay are among the nation&#x27;s most selective universities.

==Health care==
The general state of health care in Burma is poor. The military government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country&#x27;s GDP on health care, consistently ranking among the lowest in the world.
In 2005, the public health care system of Mandalay Region with over 7.6 million people consisted of slightly over 1000 doctors and about 2000 nurses working in 44 hospitals and 44 health clinics. Over 30 of the so-called hospitals had less than 100 beds. Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment.
Nonetheless, Mandalay remains the main health care center for Upper Burma as almost all of large public hospitals and private hospitals are in Mandalay. The city has ten public hospitals and one hospital specializing in traditional Burmese medicine. For a semblance of adequate health care, the well-to-do from Upper Burma go to private hospitals and clinics in Mandalay. For more advanced treatments, they have to go to Yangon or abroad. The wealthy Burmese routinely go abroad (usually Bangkok or Singapore) for treatment.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Mandalay is twinned with:
* Cirebon, Indonesia
* Kunming, China
* Phnom Penh, Cambodia
* Ulsan, South Korea

==Mandalay in popular culture==

* Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem called &quot;Mandalay&quot; (1890), which is the origin of the phrase &quot;on the road to Mandalay&quot;. In 1907, the poem was set to music by Oley Speaks as &quot;On the Road to Mandalay&quot;. Speaks&#x27; version was widely recorded. Among the best known renditions is the one by Frank Sinatra on &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot;.
* Bithia Mary Croker wrote a novel in 1917, &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot;, which was the uncredited basis for a 1926 American silent film. Of this, only excerpts survive. A further film of the same name was directed by Midi Z in 2016.
* The large hotel/casino/convention center Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas is named for the city, despite the fact that the city is 500 kilometers from the nearest bay, perhaps in reference to the line in Kipling&#x27;s poem, &quot;An&#x27; the dawn comes up like thunder outer China &#x27;crost the Bay! &quot;
* George Orwell was stationed at Mandalay for a time while working for the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, and his first novel, &quot;Burmese Days&quot; (1934), was based on his experiences in Burma. He also wrote a number of short non-fiction essays and short stories about Burma, such as &quot;A Hanging&quot; (1931) and &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot; (1936).
* John Masters wrote a book about his wartime experiences in Burma called &quot;The Road Past Mandalay&quot; (1961)..
* In the 1956 children&#x27;s song &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot;, the road to Mandalay is the location for a rendezvous of the herd:

:The head of the herd was calling far far away.
:They met one night in the silver light,
:On the road to Mandalay.
* The American film studio &quot;Mandalay Pictures&quot; is named after the city. The logo also features a tiger, which is often seen roaming around the city.
* British pop singer Robbie Williams sang a song called Eternity/The Road to Mandalay which was released as a single in 2001.

==Notable people==
* Saw Maung (1928–1997), Burmese general, chairman of State Law and Order Restoration Council
* Oo Zun (1868–1944), social worker and Buddhist nun
* Zwe Ohn Chein (1910–1979), Burmese inventor, writer and teacher

<doc id="405201" wikidata="Q777761" url="?curid=405201" title="800 Series Shinkansen">
<text>The is a Japanese Shinkansen high-speed train type operated by Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) on the Kyushu Shinkansen high-speed rail line. Built by Hitachi, the trains were introduced on the all-stops &quot;Tsubame&quot; services from March 2004.

The 800 series has a maximum speed of in service, although its maximum design speed is . It was one of the two recipients of the 45th Laurel Prize awarded by the Japan Railfan Club in 2005.

It abandoned the 700&#x27;s &quot;duckbill&quot; nose in favor of a sharper nose. The livery is white, with a red stripe.

Following the opening of the entire Kyushu Shinkansen route on 12 March 2011, 800 series trains were primarily used on all-stations &quot;Tsubame&quot; services operating mostly between and . They also operate some &quot;Sakura&quot; services within the Kyushu Shinkansen.

==Formation==
Cars 2 and 5 are equipped with PS207K single-arm pantographs.

==Build history==
The first set, set U001, was delivered on 30 August 2003 (approximately seven months ahead of the opening of the Kyushu Shinkansen between and ), with the last set, set U006, being delivered on 18 July 2005. Set U005 was withdrawn on 16 March 2018 following damage sustained from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes&#x27; 14 April foreshock.

==Interior==
As the Kyushu Shinkansen runs a large portion in tunnels, designers paid special attention to the interior design of the 800 series to create a more pleasant travel experience. More traditional materials and design features are used to embody Kyushu&#x27;s warm and natural environment.

Persimmon tannin colour is used for the walls, ancient lacquer for the doors, and Kyushu traditional rope curtain from Yatsushiroigusa for the lavatory are used. The seats are made of wood versus metal/plastic combinations from previous trains and the cushions are produced using Nishijin textiles. Window curtains are produced from prunus serrulata, and interior flooring is also made of wood.

Seating is four abreast (2 by 2), with wheelchair-accessible seating and lavatory facilities in two of the six cars.


==New 800 series==

JR Kyushu announced in December 2008 that three new 800 series sets would be delivered between summer 2009 and autumn 2010, ahead of the completion of the entire Kyushu Shinkansen route between Hakata and Kagoshima-Chūō in 2011. The first of the new batch, set U007, was delivered in June 2009, and entered service on 22 August 2009. Externally, the new sets feature minor livery changes regarding the red stripe, and internally, each car features different colour seat covers. Sets U007 and U009 include track condition monitoring equipment and are numbered in the 800–1000 series, while set U008 features overhead wire and signal monitoring equipment and is numbered in the 800–2000 series.

<text>Ashley Hall is a private school located in Charleston, South Carolina, enrolling students in kindergarten through grade 12 with a co-educational pre-k program. It was founded in 1909 by Mary Vardrine McBee, who headed the institution for many years. It is the only all-girls&#x27; independent private school in South Carolina.The school motto is &quot;Possunt Quae Volunt&quot;, or &quot;Girls who have the will have the ability.&quot;

Ashley Hall&#x27;s campus features numerous historic properties: James Nicholson House (McBee House), 172 Rutledge Avenue (c.1816-1820), Warren Street House, 89 Warren Street (c.1823), The Elizabeth Rivers Lewine ’54 House for Global Studies, 79 Rutledge Avenue (c.1876), and the Muti House for Performing Arts, 159 Rutledge Avenue (c. 1845).

==History==
In the spring of 1909, Mary Vardrine McBee bought the James Nicholson House at 172 Rutledge Avenue to found an independent college preparatory school for girls. She named the school Ashley Hall. During her 40-year tenure, the school grew from just 46 students in grades 10–12 to a much larger student body in Lower, Middle and Upper schools.

McBee established the Alumnae Association, instilling many of the traditions that still exist today, and acquiring facilities that would serve as the foundation for the institution for years to come. Her school included the McBee House (now so named) and surrounding grounds, an indoor swimming pool, the &quot;Old Gym&quot; (Burges auditorium), kitchen and dining room, the Headmistress House and faculty apartments across the street from Ashley Hall.

In 1948 the Ashley Hall Foundation was established. The Foundation purchased Ashley Hall from McBee in 1949, the year of her retirement. The Foundation&#x27;s first move was to appoint William Piper as Head of School. He served as Head from 1949 to 1954. 

Caroline Pardue joined Ashley Hall in 1950 as the Academic Head of the Upper School and teacher of history. She was appointed Headmistress in 1954 and continued to serve in that capacity for the next 25 years until 1978. Her many accomplishments include the establishment of Pardue, Lane and Jenkins Halls to officially house Lower, Middle and Upper school classrooms, the construction of Davies Auditorium, and the incorporation of a kindergarten for boys and girls. It was also during her leadership that the school shifted its student base, eliminating boarding opportunities to focus on local students. In 1976 the school graduated its first African-American student. Upon Pardue&#x27;s retirement, Marian Bell Leland assumed the role of Headmistress from 1979 to 1984. Leland was instrumental in and created the Capital Campaign, the Ashley Hall Fund, which funded the construction of the school&#x27;s gymnasium.

Margaret C. MacDonald led Ashley Hall from 1985 to 2004. She is credited for elevating the school&#x27;s academic standards. She established financial aid programs and additional scholarships, initiated the school&#x27;s first campus master plan, developed teaching excellence awards, the aquatics and admissions departments, and added to the physical property of the school. MacDonald, along with the school&#x27;s Board of Trustees, also helped create the 2003–2008 Strategic Plan. This comprehensive blueprint outlines the future goals of the school as they relate to academics, student and faculty recruitment and facilities enhancements.

<text>Fraternitas Rosae Crucis (Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, FRC or F.R.C.) is a Rosicrucian fraternal organization established in the United States by Paschal Beverly Randolph in 1856, and is the oldest Rosicrucian Order founded in the US. They also operate Beverly Hall Corporation and the Clymer Health Center in Quakertown, Pennsylvania.

==History==
The FRC&#x27;s first lodge was established in San Francisco in 1861, and closed soon after. In 1871 they established another lodge in Boston and in 1874, reestablished in San Francisco. In 1875 they finally settled in Philadelphia.

While Reuben Swinburne Clymer headed the order, the FRC established itself at Beverly Hall, in Quakertown, Pennsylvania.

<text>Hethum II, OFM (; 1266– 17 November 1307) was king of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia from 1289 to 1293, 1295 to 1296 and 1299 to 1303, while Armenia was a subject state of the Mongol Empire. He abdicated twice to take vows with the Franciscans, while still remaining the power behind the throne as &quot;Grand Baron of Armenia&quot; and later as Regent for his nephew. 

He was the son of King Leo II of Armenia and Queen Keran, and was part of the Hethumid dynasty, being the grandson of Hethum I, who had originally submitted Cilicia to the Mongols in 1247. Hethum II was assassinated with his nephew and successor Leo III by the Mongol general Bilarghu, who himself was later executed for this by the Mongol Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü.

==First reign==
Since 1247, Cilician Armenia itself had been a vassal state of the Mongol Empire, from an agreement made by Hethum II&#x27;s grandfather, Hethum I. As part of this relationship, Cilician Armenia routinely supplied troops to the Mongols, cooperating in battles against the Mamluks and other elements of the Islamic empire.

Hethum II took the throne in his early 20s, when his father Leon II died in 1289. At the time, Cilician Armenia was in a precarious position between major powers, balancing between friendly relations with the Christian European Crusaders and Byzantine Empire, aggression from the Turkish Karamanids to the west and the Turkish Sultanate of Rum to the north, a vassal relationship with the aggressive Mongol Empire in the east, and defending itself from attacks from the south, from the Muslim Mamluk Sultanate out of Egypt. The Crusades had lost European support and were winding down, and Islamic forces were sweeping northwards from Mamluk Egypt, re-taking land which had earlier been lost to the Crusaders and Mongols, and pushing back against the Mongol advance.

In 1289, Angelo da Clareno and a few other Spiritual Franciscans arrived to missionize among the Armenian Christians. They had been repeatedly jailed in Italy for their strong condemnations of luxury in the church but they won favor at the Armenian court. St Thomas of Tolentino was sent by Hethum to Rome, Paris, and London to advocate another crusade to support the Armenians; he failed in this, but returned with additional clerics to support the mission and advocate the reunification of the Armenian Church with Rome.

In 1292, Cilician Armenia was invaded by Khalil, the Mamluk sultan of Egypt. His father the Mamluk sultan Qalawun had earlier broken the treaty of 1285, was marching North through Palestine with his troops, and also demanded the surrender of the Armenian cities of Marash and Behesni. Qalawun died before the campaign was completed, but Khalil continued his father&#x27;s advance northwards, and had conquered the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1291 at the Siege of Acre. Khalil&#x27;s forces continued on from there, sacking the Armenian city of Hromgla, which was defended by Hethum&#x27;s uncle, Raymond, but fell after a siege of 33 days. To stave off further invasion, Hethum II abandoned the cities of Marash, Behesni, and Tel Hamdoun to the Mamluks.

In 1293, Hethum abdicated in favor of his brother Thoros III and entered the Franciscan monastery at Mamistra. He did stay active in the politics of the kingdom though, and negotiated with the Egyptian leader Ketbougha for the return of the prisoners who had been taken at Hromgla, as well as for some church relics which had been pillaged.

==Second reign==
In 1295, Thoros III asked Hethum to resume the throne to help renew the Mongol alliance. Hethum made the long journey to the Mongol capital, and was successfully able to request aid from the Mongols. When he returned to Armenia in 1296, further good news manifested from the Byzantine Empire, with an offer of a marital alliance. Hethum and Thoros placed Armenia under the regency of their brother Sempad, and traveled to Constantinople to bestow their sister Rita upon the Byzantine Emperor Michael IX Palaeologus. However, during their absence Sempad usurped the Armenian throne with the aid of another brother, Constantine. Hethum and Thoros were both captured in Caesarea upon their return, and imprisoned in the fortress of Partzerpert. There, Hethum was partially blinded by cauterization. Thoros was murdered in Partzerpert in 1298; but Constantine turned against Sempad, usurped the throne for himself, imprisoned Sempad and freed Hethum.
==Third reign==

In 1299, Hethum, recovered at least partially from his blindness, ousted Constantin and once again resumed the crown. Soon thereafter, he again sought assistance from Ghazan&#x27;s Mongols, and fought against the Mamluks in Syria. The combined forces achieved a major victory at the December 1299 Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar (sometimes called the Battle of Homs), taking Damascus, and Hethum was able to regain all of the Armenian territory which had previously been lost to the Mamluks. One group of Mongols split off from Ghazan&#x27;s army and was even able to launch some Mongol raids into Palestine, pursuing the retreating Egyptian Mamluk troops as far south as Gaza, pushing them back to Egypt.

According to modern traditions, Hethum may have visited Jerusalem in 1300 during this time. However, historians disagree as to whether or not the visit actually occurred. Angus Donal Stewart points out that the source of the tradition, a medieval account by the Armenian historian Nerses Balients, does not match with any other accounts by any other historians of the time period, and was simply written as Armenian propaganda of the time. However, Claude Mutafian, in &quot;Le Royaume Arménien de Cilicie&quot;, suggests that it may have been on this occasion that Hethum remitted his amber scepter to the Armenian convent of Saint James of Jerusalem.

Speculation aside, the Mongols retreated northwards a few months later, and the Mamluks reclaimed Palestine with little resistance.

Hethum&#x27;s gains against the Mamluks were short-lived, as in 1303, the Mamluks counter-attacked from Egypt. The Armenians again joined forces with a sizable number of Mongol troops, 80,000, on a Syrian offensive, but they were defeated at Homs on 30 March 1303, and at the decisive Battle of Shaqhab (Merj-us-Safer), south of Damas, on 21 April 1303. This campaign is considered to be the last major Mongol invasion of Syria. Hethum retreated to Ghazan&#x27;s court in Moussoul, and then again resigned his crown. His brother Thoros III having been killed in 1298, Hethum passed the crown to Thoros&#x27;s teenaged son, Leo III. Hethum retired to a monastery, although as Leo was not yet an adult, Hethum retained the office of Regent of Armenia.

==Later years==

In 1304, the Mamluks continued their assault on Cilician Armenia, and succeeded in taking back all the lands which the Armenians had acquired during the Mongol invasion. The Mamluks wanted to punish the Armenians for allying with the Mongols.

The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia&#x27;s alignment with the Mongol Empire continued, motivated as much by the need for self-protection from the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm on their western borders as self-interest in acquiring territory to the east, albeit short-lived. Following the conversion of the Mongol Ilkhan Ghazan to Islam in 1295, his successor Öljaitü exercised less control over outlying countries under Mongol protection and reduced the military campaigns against the Mamluks in Syria. According to contemporary Arabic and Persian accounts, one of his generals, Bilarghu, a devout Muslim, had indicated his intention to erect a mosque in the city of Sis, still part of the Christian Kingdom of Armenia, possibly as part of a wider plan to place the province under his own control. Hethum conveyed his worries about these plans by letter to Öljaitü. He was subsequently summoned by Bilarghu to a meeting on 17 November 1307, in an encampment beneath the walls of the royal stronghold of Anazarbus (&quot;Caesarea&quot; in the Roman province of Cilicia), either to hold counsel or for a banquet. Hethum attended with about 40 noblemen and his young nephew King Leon, for whom as &quot;Grand Baron&quot; he was acting as regent. Bilarghu, however, had learnt of Hethum&#x27;s letter and ordered his men to massacre the Armenian king and his guests upon their arrival. When the Armenians arrived for the banquet, they were massacred while having their meals along with Hethum and his nephew King Leon. Following this assassination, Hethum&#x27;s brother Oshin, heir to the throne, occupied Sis. He sent another brother Alinakh to report on Bilarghu&#x27;s treachery to Öljaitü, who ordered the immediate execution of Bilarghu and his soldiers and confirmed his support of Oshin as king as Leo III had no heirs since he was too young to marry when he was murdered.

<text>Leo III (or Leon III; ; occasionally numbered Leo IV; 1289–1307) was a young king of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, ruling from 1303 or 1305 to 1307, along with his uncle Hethum II. A member of the House of Lampron, he was the son of Thoros III of Armenia and Margaret of Lusignan, who was the daughter of King Hugh III of Cyprus.

In 1303, while still a minor, he was crowned King of Armenia upon the retirement of his uncle Hethum II, who became Regent. Cilician Armenia at the time was in a volatile situation, maintaining a fragile relationship as a vassal state of the Mongol Empire, while defending from attacks by the Muslim Mamluks from the south. The throne of Armenia had changed hands multiple times during Leo&#x27;s brief lifetime, being held variously by his uncle Hethum II in 1295, passed peacefully to his father Thoros III in 1296, then usurped by another uncle Sempad, who was usurped by his brother Constantine III of Armenia, who himself was deposed by his brother Hethum II in 1299. Thoros III having been killed in 1298, Hethum then passed the crown to Thoros&#x27;s son, Leo, in 1303.

In 1305, Hethum and Leo led the Armenian army to defeat a Mamluk raiding force at Bagras.

On November 17, 1307, Leo and Hethum were murdered with their retinue at a banquet while visiting the Mongol general Bilarghu at Anazarbus. Bilarghu, a Mongol who had converted to Islam, had sought to build a mosque in the capital city of Sis, but Hethum had blocked the move as he wanted Armenia to be a completely Christian kingdom and complained to the leader of the Mongol Ilkhanate, Oljeitu. Bilarghu invited Hethum, Leo, and many other important Armenian nobles to a banquet at the castle of Anazarbus, presumably for discussions, but then his forces suddenly attacked and massacred the Armenians while they were having their meals and all of the Armenian nobles were killed along with Leo and his uncle Hethum II. Bilarghu was later executed by the Mongol ilkhan Oljeitu for his actions.

After the murder of Hethum II and King Leo at the banquet, Leo was succeeded as king by another of his uncles, Oshin as Leo had no heirs when he was killed since he was too young.

==Family==
He was married to his cousin Agnes (Marie) de Lusignan (died 1309), daughter of Princess Isabella of Armenia and Amalric de Lusignan, without issue.

<text>Thoros III or Toros III (; c. 1271 – 23 July 1298) was king of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, ruling from 1293 to 1296. He was the son of Leo II of Armenia and Kyranna de Lampron, and was part of the House of Lampron. In 1293 his brother Hethum II abdicated in his favour; however, Thoros recalled Hethum to the throne as co-ruler in 1295. The two brought their sister Rita of Armenia to Constantinople to marry the Byzantine emperor Michael IX Palaiologos in 1296, but were imprisoned upon their return in Bardzrberd by their brother Sempad, who had usurped the throne in their absence. Thoros was murdered, strangled to death on 23 July 1298, in Bardzrberd by Oshin, Marshal of Armenia, on Sempad&#x27;s orders.

==Family==
Thoros was married twice; his first marriage, to Margaret of Lusignan (ca 1276–1296, Armenia) (the daughter of King Hugh III of Cyprus), took place on 9 January 1288. His only son, by his first marriage, was Leo III of Armenia, who became heir to his uncle Hethum II. Leo ruled from 1303 to 1307, but was murdered along with his uncle by the Mongol general Bilarghu at a feast.

<text>was a Japanese anarchist, social critic, author, and feminist. She was the editor-in-chief of the feminist magazine &quot;Seitō (Bluestocking)&quot;. Her progressive anarcha-feminist ideology challenged the norms of the Meiji and Taishō periods in which she lived. She drew praise from critics by being able to weave her personal and political ideas into her writings. The Japanese government, however, condemned her for challenging the constructs of the time. She became a martyr of the anarchist ideology in which she believed during the Amakasu Incident, when she was murdered along with her lover, anarchist author Ōsugi Sakae, and his nephew.

== Early life and education ==
Itō was born on the island of Kyushu near Fukuoka, Japan on January 21, 1895. She was born into an aristocratic family and convinced an uncle to pay for her education at Ueno Girls High School in Tokyo, from which she graduated. It was at this school where she developed an affinity for literature. She was particularly fond of the progressive ideas of the time from Western and Japanese writers.

It was during her second summer vacation, in 1910, at Ueno Girls School that her family pressured her to marry Suematsu Fukutaro, a man who had recently returned to Kyushu from the United States. Marrying Suematsu would be a stipulation that she had to agree to in order to continue her education. Itō wanted her own complete freedom, so she immediately started to plot a way to escape the relationship and make her home in Tokyo. She made a major move in her life to Tokyo, marrying an ex-teacher, Tsuji Jun, whom she had met at Ueno Girls High School. After graduation, Itō&#x27;s relationship with Tsuji became romantic and they had two sons, Makoto (born January 20, 1914) and Ryūji (born August 10, 1915). They were officially married in 1915. Their relationship lasted about four years.

== Time with &quot;Seitō&quot; ==
Itō joined the Bluestocking Society (青鞜社 &quot;Seitō-sha&quot;), as producer of the feminist arts-and-culture magazine &quot;Seitō&quot; (青鞜) in 1915, contributing until 1916. In her last year as Editor-in-Chief, she practiced an inclusive attitude towards content; she &quot;opened the pages to extended discussions of abortion, prostitution, free love and motherhood&quot;. &quot;Seitō&quot; founder, Hiratsuka Raichō, would describe her as a writer with intense and natural emotion. Itō&#x27;s time as editor was fragile, as many thought the young editor would not be capable of steering the publication. On the cover of the July 1916 issue Itō published her &quot;Anti-Manifesto,&quot; in which she discusses the views of the readership on her capabilities. She ends the editor&#x27;s note with a declaration that the magazine will be &quot;for all women, a magazine which has no ideology and no philosophy.&quot;

Under Itō&#x27;s editorship, &quot;Seitō&quot; became a more radical journal, which led the government to ban five issues as threatening the &quot;kokutai (national system of government)&quot;. The February 1914 edition was banned by the censors because of a short story Itō had published in the journal titled &quot;Shuppon&quot; (&quot;Flight&quot;), about a young woman who escapes from an arranged marriage and is then betrayed by her lover who promised to escape with her from Japan. The June 1915 edition was banned for an article calling for abortion to be legalized in Japan. 

Three other editions of &quot;Seitō&quot; were banned: one edition because of an erotic short story where a woman happily remembers having sex the previous night; another edition for a short story dealing with the break-up of an arranged marriage, and another edition for an article titled &quot;To The Women of the World&quot; calling for women to marry for love. The narratives in Itō&#x27;s stories held common themes: they were all influenced by her own thoughts on her political and personal beliefs, painting a vivid literary picture of the issues afflicting her at the time.

Her personal writings published in &quot;Seitō&quot; dealt with the many problems that she had dealt with in her own life such as arranged marriages, denial of the free love she much longed for, and the sexual nature that all humans felt but had been repressed. Her short story &quot;Mayoi&quot; in 1914 told the story of a student who moves in with her ex-school teacher, only to find out he had been intimate with her former classmate. This story directly parallels her own life with Tsuji Jun. &quot;Tenki&quot;, another one of her stories published by &quot;Seitō,&quot; dealt with more of her own issues, as the main protagonist is drawn to social activism while her marriage proves to be an obstacle. Itō&#x27;s writing was a way for her to express her personal beliefs, and she often used her own real life events to draw upon in order to create her stories. In total, she contributed 61 pieces to the magazine.

Under Itō, &quot;Seitō&quot; became more concerned with social issues than it had been before, and in 1914–16, she engaged in a debate on the pages of the magazine with another feminist, Yamakawa Kikue, about whether prostitution should be legalized or not. Itō argued for the legalization of prostitution for the same reasons that she favored the legalization of abortion, namely that she believed that women&#x27;s bodies belonged only to them, and that the state had no business telling a woman what she may or may not do with her body.

Furthermore, Itō argued that the social system did not offer many economic opportunities to women and that most Japanese prostitutes were destitute women who turned to selling sex in order to survive, which led her to the conclusion that they should not be punished for merely seeking a means to live. Itō wrote social criticism and novels, and translated socialist and anarchist writings from English to Japanese, from authors such as American Emma Goldman (&quot;The Tragedy of Woman&#x27;s Emancipation&quot;, etc.). In February 1916, &quot;Seitō&quot; published its last edition due to a lack of funds, as the government had prevented distributors from carrying the magazine.

== Life with Sakae Ōsugi ==
Itō met Sakae Ōsugi in 1916. Together they kept working together in both political activism and political writings. As a couple they practiced free love and they never married. Sakae Ōsugi was married with another woman at the time and also had an affair with another feminist, Ichiko Kamichika.

Itō&#x27;s passion for Ōsugi became evident in February 1916, when she went walking with him in a Tokyo park, holding his hand, and kissed him in public; at the time, kissing in public and couples holding hands in Japan were considered to be deeply immoral acts that no decent person should ever engage in, and many people in the park chided the couple for their behavior. Later that same day, when Ōsugi met Ichiko, he told her that he had kissed a woman in public for the first time in his life, to which Ichiko reacted with jealousy.

Itō, who was hoping to see Ōsugi again, had followed him to Ichiko&#x27;s apartment, where she was listening in. She chose to knock on the door to involve herself in this conversation. This in turn caused an angry scene between the two women over who loved Ōsugi the best, while Ōsugi insisted he loved both equally. Ōsugi continued to live with his wife while seeing both Ichiko and Itō until November 1916, when in a moment of jealousy Ichiko followed Ōsugi and Itō to a countryside inn. Upon seeing that they had spent the night together, she attacked Ōsugi with a knife as he emerged from his room in the morning, stabbing him several times in the throat. Ōsugi was hospitalized as a result of his wounds and his wife left him during his stay in hospital.

Itō and Ōsugi would have four children together, and would stay together for the rest of their lives despite never actually being legally married. Her relationship with him would remain political as well, as she worked with him as a publishing partner. They would work together to further their ideas on anarchism through their writings and publishings, and would both become targets of the state and critics through their unabashed loyalty to their cause. In 1921, Itō wrote articles published in &quot;Rōdō Undō (Labor Movement),&quot; a journal which she published with Ōsugi.

Beginning in 1916, Ito lived and worked with Ōsugi, and continued to rise in the feminist group while showing growing leadership potential. As an anarchist, Itō was highly critical of the existing political system in Japan, which led her to call for an anarchism to exist in &quot;everyday practice,&quot; namely that people should in various small ways seek routinely to undermine the &quot;kokutai&quot;. Itō was especially critical of the way that most Japanese people automatically deferred to the state and accepted the claim that the emperor was a god who had to be obeyed unconditionally, leading her to complain that it was very difficult to get most people to think critically. As someone who had challenged the kokutai, Itō was constantly harassed by the police, to the point that she complained of feeling that her home was a prison, as she could not go out without a policeman stopping her.

== Death ==
On September 16, 1923, according to writer and activist Harumi Setouchi, Itō, Ōsugi, and his 6-year-old nephew Munekazu (born in Portland, Oregon) were arrested, strangled to death, and thrown into an abandoned well by a squad of military police (known as the Kenpeitai) led by Lieutenant Masahiko Amakasu. The atrocity happened in the chaos immediately following the Great Kantō earthquake. Once the bodies were retrieved from the well, both Ōsugi and Itō&#x27;s bodies were inspected and found to be covered with bruises indicating that they had been severely beaten. According to literary scholar Patricia Morley, Itō and Ōsugi were strangled in their cells. Noe Itō was 28 years old.

The killing of such high-profile anarchists, together with a young child, became known as the Amakasu Incident and sparked shock and anger throughout Japan. Amakasu was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for the murders, but he was released after serving only three years.

Itō and Ōsugi are both buried in the Kutsunoya cemetery in Aoi-ku, Shizuoka.

== Legacy ==
Director Kijū Yoshida made &quot;Eros + Massacre&quot; in 1969, about Sakae Ōsugi; Itō features prominently in the film.

A drama based on Yuka Murayama&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Kaze yo, Arashi yo&quot;, starring Yuriko Yoshitaka as Itō, is being broadcast on three NHK channels: NHK 8K on 31 March 2022 (one 120-minute episode), and NHK 4K and NHK BS Premium on 4, 11 and 18 September 2022 (three 49-minute episodes).

<text>The Gewehr 41 , commonly known as the G41(W) or G41(M), denoting the manufacturer (Walther or Mauser), are two distinct and different battle rifles manufactured and used by Nazi Germany during World War II. They were largely superseded by the Gewehr 43, which was derived from the G41(W), but with an improved gas system and other detail changes.

==Background==

While the Germans experimented with semi-automatic rifles as early as 1901, they didn&#x27;t consider introducing such a weapon until the Soviets began issuing the SVT-40 rifle in large numbers for their troops.

German semi-automatic recoil-operated prototypes proved to be too heavy and not meeting military requirements during trials, while their experience with the Mondragón rifle during World War 1, and studies on captured RSC M1917 rifles, both of which had several flaws, left the German High Command skeptical of gas-operated rifles in general, relying instead on tried and tested Mauser bolt-action rifles and recoil-operated light machine guns.

Samples of AVS-36 rifles captured during the Spanish Civil War were studied by the Germans, but apparently they still considered gas systems as too impractical for military rifles.

During the early years of WWII, the Germans were becoming increasingly aware of other nations adopting semi-automatic rifles in large numbers: besides the AVS-36, the Soviets introduced the SVT-38 (and later the improved SVT-40), while the Americans adopted the M1 Garand to increase their infantry&#x27;s firepower. According to Smith, the Germans were so familiar with the Garand upon its introduction that popular firearms publications in Germany included photos and descriptions of the M1. The Gewehr 41 would later incorporate a gas trap system similar to the early Garand.

In 1940, the Army high command launched a competitive program for a new semi-auto rifle, with Mauser and Walther as the main competitors, and the following restrictions placed upon the design:

* no holes were to be bored into the barrel for tapping gas for the loading mechanism;
* the rifles were not to have any moving parts on the surface;
* and in case the auto-loading mechanism failed, a bolt action was to be included.

== Description ==

Both designs used a mechanism known as the &quot;Bang&quot; system (after its Danish designer Søren H. Bang). In this system, propellant gases were captured by a cone-shaped gas trap at the muzzle, which in turn deflected them to operate a small piston which in turn pushed on a long piston rod that opened the breech and re-loaded the gun. This is as opposed to the more common type of gas-actuated system, in which gases are tapped off from the barrel, and pushed back on a piston to open the breech to the rear. They also used the 7.92×57mm Mauser round, having a range comparable to the standard-issue Karabiner 98k rifle. In comparison to the Kar98k, the Gewehr 41 rifles were longer and heavier, and the only advantages they offered were limited to a higher rate of fire and an extra five rounds in the magazine.

The Mauser design, the G41(M), was the only one of the two that respected the criteria imposed. It proved to be unreliable during trials and impractical for field use. The G41(M) was striker-fired, rotating-bolt locking, and featured a traditional bolt handle/charging handle that automatically disconnected the bolt assembly from the recoil spring should the rifle be used in manual mode. The bolt system was in many ways analogous to the straight-pull Mannlicher M1895 rifle. Only 6,673 were produced before production was halted, and of these, nearly 1,700 were returned as unusable.

The Walther design was more successful because the designers had simply ignored some of the restrictions placed by the German High Command (namely no moving parts on the surface of the gun, and the inclusion of a manual bolt-action backup mechanism). However it was still a heavy, complex, and unreliable weapon. The G41(W) was produced in small numbers (up to 7,500 in total) before it was officially adopted by the German Army as the Gewehr 41. According to McNab, around 120,000 Gewehr 41s were made in total. 

While the breech locking and firing systems on the G41(W) proved to be cheap and satisfactory enough for field use, the complex gas trap system proved to be difficult to be kept meticulously clean in the field resulting in malfunctions, often suffering from carbon fouling and/or corrosion.

According to Pegler, the Gewehr 41 performance was on par with the Soviet SVT-38. Like the Tokarev rifle, the gas system had to be carefully adjusted. Use of poor-quality ammunition would fail to feed rounds or extract spent cartridge cases if the pressure was too low; on the other hand, if the pressure was too high it would rip off the cartridge cases, causing the gun to jam. 

The G41(W) was thoroughly tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, where its reliability proved to be inferior to the M1 Garand under severe conditions, especially when exposed to mud and rain. Mechanical breakdowns during testing were also frequent.

==History==

It was mostly used in the Eastern Front, where it proved to be less than successful due to the excessive weight and complexity of the Bang system, but it was the only semi-auto rifle the Germans were producing in significant quantities until the introduction of the improved Gewehr 43.

The Gewehr 41 was redesigned in 1943 into the Gewehr 43, utilizing a short-stroke piston copied from the SVT-40 rifle, and implementing a conventional detachable box magazine, while keeping the Gewehr 41 locking system. Despite this, the remaining Gewehr 41s were kept in service for the rest of the war.

<text>is a special ward in the Tokyo Metropolis in Japan. The ward refers to itself in English as Chūō City. It was formed in 1947 as a merger of Kyōbashi and Nihonbashi wards following Tokyo City&#x27;s transformation into Tokyo Metropolis.

Chūō-ku, as a combination of Kyōbashi and Nihonbashi, is the core of Shitamachi, the original downtown center of Edo-Tokyo. Literally meaning &quot;Central Ward&quot;, it is historically the main commercial center of Tokyo, although Shinjuku has risen to challenge it since the end of World War II.

The most famous district in Chūō is Ginza, built on the site of a former silver mint from which it takes its name. The gold mint, or , formerly occupied the site of the present-day Bank of Japan headquarters building, also in Chūō.

As of October 1, 2020, the ward has a resident population of 169,179, and a population density of 16,569 persons per km2. The total area is 10.21 km2. However, because of the concentration of businesses, offices and retail space, the daytime population swells to an estimated 650,000.

==Geography==
Chūō is in the central area of Tokyo, surrounded by the five special wards of Chiyoda, Minato, Taitō, Sumida, and Kōtō.

Administratively, Chūō is divided into the three zones of Nihonbashi, Kyōbashi and Tsukishima. Nihonbashi and Kyōbashi are predominantly commercial areas on the east side of Tokyo Station, and incorporate the famous districts of Ginza and Tsukiji. Tsukishima is a separate island in Tokyo Bay dominated by condominium towers.

Until World War II, the area was crisscrossed by small rivers and canals, used by small boats which were the primary vehicles of commerce at the time. After the war, many of these waterways were filled in to make way for new roads, buildings and expressways. However, the former waterways are the basis for many of the neighborhood divisions in the ward. The Sumida River forms the eastern boundary of the ward.

Chūō is physically the second-smallest ward in Tokyo, with a total area of just 10.15 km2; only Taitō is smaller.

==History==
* 1612: Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu, planning to establish Edo as the de facto capital of Japan, begins work on a new commercial district surrounding the eastern end of the Tōkaidō, the main road connecting Tokyo and the Kansai region. During the Edo period this area is known as Edomachi—the town center of Edo. Much of the area (particularly Ginza and Tsukiji) was loose sand piled at the delta of the Sumida River before being filled in by the shogunate.
* 1657: After a fire consumes much of the city, the area is re-planned with more canals to accommodate more maritime commerce.
* 1869: A foreigners&#x27; settlement is established in Tsukiji. It continues until about 1899.
* 1872: A fire consumes much of the Ginza area. In its aftermath, the governor of Tokyo re-plans Ginza to be a modern European-style commercial district between Shinbashi (the city&#x27;s main railway terminal at the time) to the south and Nihonbashi (the main business and financial district) to the north.
* 1878: Under a new local organization statute, the wards of Nihonbashi and Kyōbashi are established under the government of Tokyo City, covering the area now occupied by Chūō.
* 1945: Following Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, several buildings are taken over by SCAP to serve as supply centers for the occupation forces. These include the Hattori Watch Company, the Matsuya department store and the Toshiba Building. The buildings are returned to Japanese civilian control by 1951.
* 1947: Chūō Ward is founded on March 15 under the new Local Autonomy Law, merging the former Nihonbashi and Kyōbashi wards.

<doc id="405253" wikidata="Q696016" url="?curid=405253" title="Gothaer Waggonfabrik">
<text>Gothaer Waggonfabrik (&quot;Gotha&quot;, GWF) was a German manufacturer of rolling stock established in the late nineteenth century at Gotha. During the two world wars, the company expanded into aircraft building.

==World War I==
In World War I, Gotha was the manufacturer of a highly successful series of bombers based on a 1914 design by Oskar Ursinus and developed by Hans Burkhard. From 1917, the Burkhard-designed twin pusher biplane bomber aircraft were capable of carrying out strategic bombing missions over England, the first heavier-than-air aircraft used in this role. Several dozen of these bombers were built in a number of subtypes - the Ursinus-based Gotha G.I, and the succeeding Burkhard-designed G.II, G.III, G.IV, and G.V. This last variant was the most prolific, with thirty-six in squadron service at one point.

==Inter war years==
Whilst Germany was prohibited from military aircraft manufacture by the Treaty of Versailles, Gotha returned to its railway endeavours, but returned to aviation with the rise of the Nazi government and the abandonment of the Treaty&#x27;s restrictions.

===Auto-production 1921–1928===
In 1921 the company purchased Automobilwerk Eisenach, thereby entering automobile production and, with the Dixi 3/15 DA-1 playing an important part in expanding the German auto-market to buyers who hitherto would have ridden motorcycles, if at all. The company encountered a cash crisis in 1928 and the Dixi branded auto-business was sold to BMW: the Dixi 3/15 DA-1 was rebadged in 1928 as the BMW 3/15 DA-2, the name by which today the little car is better remembered.

In 1924 the Cyklon Maschinenfabrik, a manufacturer that had concentrated on motor-bikes and cycle cars came to be merged into the larger Gothaer Waggonfabrik business, through a rather indirect route of company purchases and sales. This gave Cyklon access to the viable sales and distribution network of Dixi and aspirations to become a serious auto-producer. Between 1927 and 1929 the company produced the Cyklon 9/40 which at the time was the most inexpensive six cylinder powered car sold in Germany. The conservative looking car featured a modern all-steel body produced by Germany&#x27;s leading producer of steel car bodies, Ambi-Budd&#x27;s Berlin based business. It was, in fact, the first all-steel standard car body produced by Ambi-Budd in Berlin and, incongruously to some modern readers, was shared with the Adler Standard 6, a more powerful and higher priced six cylinder car from one of Germany&#x27;s mainstream auto-makers of the 1930s. The sale by Gothaer Waggonfabrik of the cash-strapped Dixi business to BMW meant an end to Cyklon&#x27;s access to a sales network, and highlighted the lack of cash for running the auto-business which rapidly fizzled out after 1928, although Cyklon was not formally wound up until 1931.

==World War II==
Gotha&#x27;s main contribution to the new Luftwaffe was the Gotha Go 145 trainer, of which 1,182 were built. The firm also produced the Gotha Go 242 assault glider and licence-built Messerschmitt Bf 110. Perhaps the most famous Gotha product of World War II, however, was an aircraft that never entered service, the Horten Ho 229. This was an exotic jet-powered, flying wing fighter aircraft designed by the Horten brothers, who lacked the facilities to mass-produce it. Two prototypes flew, the second (powered) version lost in an accident on its third flight. The third prototype- built to a modified design - was almost complete and four more were in various stages of manufacture before the end of the war. The Ho 229 V3 ended up in American hands, and is currently at the NASM&#x27;s Udvar-Hazy Center, under evaluation for restoration.

On 22 February 1944, a squadron of American bombers was sent from Britain to bomb the factory, but due to bad weather, the mission was cancelled before they reached Gotha. On the way back, the Dutch border city of Nijmegen was bombed instead as a &#x27;target of opportunity&#x27;, killing hundreds of civilians.

On 24 February 1944, 239 American B-24s are dispatched to the primary target at Gotha, Germany (169 bomb Gotha); the lead bombardier from 2AD suffered from anoxia due to a faulty oxygen mask and mistook Eisenach as the primary target, 43 other B-24s released on his mistake (44 bomb Eisenach); they claim 50-10-20 Luftwaffe aircraft; 34 B-24s are lost and 29 are damaged; casualties are: 3 KIA, 6 WIA and 324 MIA.

==Post war==
Following the war, Gotha once again returned to its original purpose, building trams and light rail vehicles in the former East Germany. The tram production ended in 1967, after East Germany started importing ČKD-Tatra trams from Czechoslovakia.
From 1983 on, parts for the Wartburg 535/1.3 were produced. After the end of the Wartburg production in Eisenach after 1991 the production concentrated on truck trailers. In 1997 the company was split and privatized by the Treuhandanstalt.

Today the &quot;Schmitz Cargobull Gotha GmbH&quot; (production site of Schmitz Cargobull AG) produces around 4000 truck trailers per year. The second successor is the &quot;Gothaer Fahrzeugtechnik GmbH&quot;, which produces lattice mast elements for mobile cranes and welded components.

<doc id="405264" wikidata="Q1028412" url="?curid=405264" title="Greenland cod">
<text>The Greenland cod (Gadus ogac), commonly known also as ogac, is a species of ray-finned fish in the cod family, Gadidae. Genetic analysis has shown that it may be the same species as the Pacific cod (&quot;Gadus macrocephalus&quot;). It is a bottom-dwelling fish and is found on the continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean and northwestern Atlantic Ocean, its range extending from Alaska to West Greenland, then southwards along the Canadian coast to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Cape Breton Island. It is a commercially harvested food fish, but landings have been greatly reduced in recent years.

==Taxonomy==
Molecular genetic analyses strongly suggest that Greenland cod is not different from Pacific cod, &quot;Gadus macrocephalus&quot; - &quot;Gadus ogac&quot; is then a junior synonym of &quot;G. macrocephalus&quot;. ITIS and the Catalogue of Life list &quot;Gadus ogac&quot; as synonym of &quot;G. macrocephalus&quot;.

==Description==

In colour the Greenland cod is generally sombre, ranging from tan to brown to silvery. Its appearance is similar to that of other cod species; generally heavy-bodied, elongate, usually with a stout caudal peduncle. They can grow to a length of 77 cm.

They are bottom fishes inhabiting inshore waters and continental shelves, up to depths of 200 m. Their range covers the Arctic Ocean and Northwest Atlantic Ocean from Alaska to West Greenland, then south along the Canadian coast to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Cape Breton Island generally from 45 to 75 degrees north.

The stock of Greenland cod has been strongly reduced in recent years.

<doc id="405274" wikidata="Q506087" url="?curid=405274" title="Henry I of Cyprus">
<text>Henry I of Cyprus, nicknamed the Fat (; 3 May 1217 – 18 January 1253 at Nicosia) was King of Cyprus from 1218 to 1253. He was the son of Hugh I of Cyprus and Alice of Champagne. When his father Hugh I died on January 10, 1218, the 8-month-old Henry became king. His mother was the official regent, but delegated governing to her uncle, Philip of Ibelin. When Philip died, the effective regency passed to his brother John, Old Lord of Beirut.

==Biography==

Henry was crowned at the age of 8 at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, in 1225. The reason for the early coronation was as a political maneuver by his uncle Philip, who sensed that Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, was going to attempt to seize power. In 1228 this did occur, as Frederick forced John of Ibelin to hand over the regency to Amalric Barlais, and the island of Cyprus. However, when Frederick left the island in April, John counter-attacked and regained control, which began the War of the Lombards. Henry was able to assume control of the kingdom when he came of age at 15, in 1232, and maintained close ties with the Ibelin family.

Henry himself served as Regent of Jerusalem for Conrad of Hohenstaufen 1246–1253.

He was married three times; his third wife, whom he married in 1250, was Plaisance of Antioch, daughter of Bohemund V of Antioch. They had a son, Hugh.

On his death, Henry was succeeded by his only child, his infant son Hugh II (b. 1253). If he had not had children, his heirs were his eldest sister&#x27;s sons Jean de Brienne (b. 1234) and Hugh of Brienne (b. c. 1240), as well as his younger sister&#x27;s son Hugh of Antioch, the future Hugh III of Cyprus (b. c. 1235). Henry was buried at the Church of the Templars, at Nicosia.

Consorts:
# Alix of Montferrat (1210/1215 – Kyrenia, December, 1232 – May, 1233, buried at Santa Sophia, Nicosia), daughter of Marquis William VI of Montferrat, by Bertha da Clavesana, married at Limassol in May, 1229, without issue
# Stephanie of Lampron (ca. 1220/1225 – soon after April 1, 1249, buried at Santa Sophia, Nicosia), daughter of Constantine of Lampron, Regent of Armenia, by Stephanie of Barbaron, married at Nicosia in 1237/1238, without issue
# Plaisance of Antioch (1235 – September 22/27, 1261), daughter of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli, by Lucienne of Segni, married at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, in 1250, and had issue, an only son: Hugh II of Cyprus.

<text>Alan David Goodrick (born April 1962 in Manchester), better known under the pseudonym Gimpo, is an English film director and former roadie, best known as an associate and collaborator of The KLF and the K Foundation.

Goodwick organises an annual 25-hour drive around the M25 called the M25 spin, repeated every year on the weekend closest to 23 March (with many KLF fans from around the world joining in). The first time this took place was in 1997 when he was accompanied by Bill Drummond and artist Dave Green, and has produced a film of this event. The M25 spin can be seen as exploring similar motifs to those in Iain Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;London Orbital&quot; book.

In August 1994, Goodrick made a film of K Foundation originators Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty burning one million pounds sterling in cash; he kept the master tapes before the Foundation reacquired them. He drove Drummond and Mark Manning to the top of the world (as recounted in &quot;Bad Wisdom&quot;).

He was the ski-masked person fumbling with lighter fluid and matches when Rachel Whiteread came to claim the K Foundation art award.

He is currently an underground/alternative arts film maker and is frequently involved with both Drummond and Jimmy Cauty&#x27;s current projects. Although he has claimed that he has given up the role, he is often described as a roadie.

==Background==
Goodrick reportedly served with the British Army in the Falklands War. He later met up with Zodiac Mindwarp (the alter ego of Mark Manning) and started to work part-time with his band &quot;The Love Reaction&quot;. After a period as a roadie for various Food Records bands such as Blur and Jesus Jones, he set up Pit Bull management and began to manage the Love Reaction.

<doc id="405276" wikidata="Q190088" url="?curid=405276" title="Minato, Tokyo">
<text>is a special ward of Tokyo, Japan. It is also called Minato City in English.

Minato was formed in 1947 as a merger of Akasaka, Azabu and Shiba wards following Tokyo City&#x27;s transformation into Tokyo Metropolis. The modern Minato ward exhibits the contrasting Shitamachi and Yamanote geographical and cultural division. The Shinbashi neighborhood in the ward&#x27;s northeastern corner is attached to the core of Shitamachi, the original commercial center of Edo-Tokyo. On the other hand, the Azabu and Akasaka areas are typically representative Yamanote districts.

, Minato had an official population of 243,094, and a population density of 10,850 persons per km2. The total area is 20.37 km2.

Known as one of Tokyo&#x27;s largest business areas, Minato is home to the headquarters of many large domestic companies, including Honda, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, NEC, Nikon, SoftBank Group, Sony and Fujitsu. Minato is also known for being one of the wealthiest residential areas in Japan, and for its relatively high concentration of foreign expats due to the number of embassies and multinational corporations located in and around the area. Notable neighborhoods and districts of Minato include Akasaka, Aoyama, Azabu, Roppongi and Toranomon. 

==Geography==
Minato is located southwest of the Imperial Palace and has boundaries with the special wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, Kōtō (in Odaiba), Shinagawa, Shibuya, and Shinjuku.
==History==
The ward was founded on 15 March 1947, with the merger of Akasaka, Azabu, and Shiba Wards. Various names were considered for the new ward, such as &quot;Atago&quot;, &quot;Aoyama&quot;, &quot;Aoba&quot;, &quot;Iikura&quot;, &quot;Mita&quot;, and &quot;Higashiminato&quot;. &quot;Higashiminato&quot; was chosen, meaning &quot;East Harbor&quot;, but then &quot;Higashi&quot; was cut leading to the name &quot;Minato&quot;, simply meaning &quot;harbor&quot;.

== Demographics ==
Per Japanese census data, the population has recently begun rising after decades of rapid decline.

== Politics and government ==
In June 2024, Ai Seike beat in mayoral elections. Takei, mayor since 2004, was seeking his sixth term and received support from the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito. Seike, previously a member of the ward assembly, is the first female mayor of Minato. 

The ward assembly has 34 members.

<text>The Lotus Europa name is used on two distinct mid-engine GT cars built by British automobile manufacturer Lotus Cars. The original Europa and its variants comprise the Lotus Types 46, 47, 54, 65 and 74, and were produced between 1966 and 1975.

The name was later revived in the Type 121 Europa S, a sports car based on the Lotus Elise produced from 2006 to 2010.

==Europa (1966–1975)==
By the mid-1960s, the mid-engine vehicle configuration was well-established as the optimal design for Grand Prix cars, however almost no road vehicles yet used this arrangement. Lotus planned the Europa to be a volume-produced, two-seater mid-engine sports coupe built to reasonable cost, quite an ambitious goal for the time. Like all Lotus vehicles of the era, the Europa was designed and built following Colin Chapman&#x27;s oft-stated philosophy of automotive design: &quot;Simplify, then add lightness&quot;. To this end, a number of ingenious design approaches were made by Lotus to allow it to economically overcome the many challenges presented by the novel mid-engine arrangement.

Production of the original Lotus Europa ceased in 1975, with a total of 9,230 cars of all models having been built.

===Design features===

The Europa used a lightweight, folded and welded &quot;minimalist&quot; boxed-steel backbone chassis with a fibreglass moulded body, a combination that was first used by Lotus founder Colin Chapman in the Lotus Elan launched in 1962. Earliest versions of the Europa had the body fully bonded to the chassis for maximum structural stiffness, however this was soon changed to a bolted-on body to allow normal chassis and body repairs to be made. Unlike the Elan, the Europa had no front-mounted engine or gearbox to accommodate, and so the Europa&#x27;s main chassis member ran straight forward to intersect a large box-section cross-beam running across the car between the front suspension points. At the rear, the chassis split into a &quot;U&quot; shape behind the cabin to accommodate the combined engine, transmission and final-drive components, and to support the rear suspension.

====Engine and transaxle====
The sourcing of suitable engine, gearbox and final-drive components was considered critical to the success of delivering a low-cost mid-engine vehicle. Chapman was keen to diversify beyond the Ford components heavily used in earlier Lotus vehicles, and settled on using the engine and combined transmission/final-drive transaxle units recently released by Renault for its 16. The Renault engine was a light and modern design, while the matching Renault 16 transaxle seemed almost ideal for the Europa project. In the Renault, the transaxle sat ahead of the engine, driving the front wheels. By relocating the combined engine/transaxle unit to the rear of the car and rotating it 180 degrees in plan, Lotus could obtain a ready-made modern mid-engine configuration - albeit one with four reverse gears. By repositioning the differential crownwheel within the final drive assembly (made possible by the symmetrical split case), the direction of rotation of the output shafts was reversed, thus correcting this shortcoming.

The Renault 16&#x27;s engine&#x27;s design met Lotus&#x27;s requirements. It used an aluminium block with cast-iron cylinder liners, which saved appreciable weight compared to the cast-iron blocks more common at the time. Its overhead-valve design had the camshaft located high-up in the block, resulting in a compact valve-train well suited for high-rpm operation. Most importantly, all the engine ancillaries (water pump, belt-drives, alternator) were driven off a v-belt pulley fixed to the transaxle end of the camshaft instead of being driven by the engine&#x27;s crankshaft. When fitted to the Europa, this pulley location put all the engine&#x27;s ancillaries at its rear face giving easy access for maintenance, rather than them being located against the vehicle&#x27;s bulkhead as-for most conventional engines.

For Lotus&#x27;s use, the Renault engine was given a number of key improvements, including a higher compression ratio (10.25 instead of 8.6), larger inlet valves, revised valve timings, dual valve springs and a twin-barrel carburettor. These changes lifted the engine&#x27;s power by 23% from at 5,000 rpm to at 6,000 rpm. For US export, a de-tuned version with a maximum output of at 6,000 rpm was fitted.

Later, Europa models were fitted with the same Ford-based Lotus TwinCam engine used in the Elan range since 1962. This was a sophisticated, twin-overhead-cam, 8-valve high-performance engine rated at in original (Euro) specification (later uprated to in &quot;big-valve&quot; form). It was reported that Lotus initially delayed its introduction in the Europa until they were confident in the strength of the Renault transaxle. The twin-cam engine first appeared in the Europa engine bay in mid-1971 (in Europe) and early 1972 (in North America). In North America, both the (early) 1972 Twin Cam version and (late) 1972–1974 Twin Cam &quot;Special&quot; versions were rated at in Federalized Form.

When Renault introduced its most powerful 16 TX model in 1973, it included a strengthened five-speed transmission. Lotus quickly offered this gearbox as an option in the Europa, along with the big valve twin-cam engine.

====Suspension====
The Europa&#x27;s four-wheel independent suspension was also typical Chapman thinking. The front used lightweight pressed steel upper and lower wishbones with a clever coil-over spring-damper arrangement, all connected to the wheels using off-the-shelf front uprights, ball joints and trunnions.
The steering gear was solid-mounted rack and pinion using components from the Triumph Herald.

The rear suspension was a heavily modified version of the Chapman strut, originally developed for Chapman&#x27;s earlier Formula racing car designs and used in the Elan. In the Europa, the vertical &quot;strut&quot; element pivots on the wheel hub at its lower end and doesn&#x27;t control wheel camber angle as-in earlier Lotus designs. Wheel location and alignment is controlled instead by interaction between a fixed-length, articulated driveshaft top link, a simple tubular lower link, and a large box-section radius arm running diagonally forward to the chassis. These radius arms played a critical role in giving the precise tracking and handling desired, as the Chapman Strut&#x27;s use of the driveshaft to resist lateral forces was compromised by the rubber engine and transaxle mounts needed to isolate vibrations from the car body. A careful compromise between the radius arm mount&#x27;s stiffness, isolation and car handling was required, culminating eventually in a sandwich bush that was flexible against shear but stiff in compression and tension. The car&#x27;s subsequent resulting handling prompted automotive writers to describe the Europa as the nearest thing to a Formula car for the road.

===Series 1===

The Series 1 or S1 Europa (also known as Lotus Type 46) was announced for sale to European markets on 20 December 1966. The first cars were delivered in France in February 1967. Volkswagen owned the rights to the Europa name in Germany, so cars for sale in Germany were badged Europe rather than Europa.

The S1 was fitted with a modified Renault 16 1,470 cc straight-four engine and a four-speed gearbox. The engine was a special version (as opposed to the generated in standard form). Lotus adapted the affordable but lightweight Renault engine and gearbox to the revolutionary Europa longitudinal mid-engined layout, inverting the gearbox&#x27;s crown wheel on its pinion gear to avoid having four reverse gears. The S1 weighed . &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine achieved a top speed of , and recorded a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 9.3 seconds. Of particular note, in excess of 0.9 &quot;g&quot; (8 m/s2) lateral acceleration was consistently achieved by &quot;Car&quot; magazine on road tyres of that era.

Only 296 examples of the S1 were manufactured (chassis numbers from 460001 to 460296). These cars had extremely light and minimalist construction, with fixed side windows, fixed seats (adjustable pedals needing the use of tools), no door handles, no internal door covers, and an aluminum dashboard. The steel chassis central beam was sandwiched (incorporated) within the fibreglass bodywork, thus reinforcing stiffness, but making repair rather complicated.

Series 1A and B (around 350 built) had removable side windows, wooden dashboard, and internal door panel covers which could accommodate the windows once taken off. Series 1B had a redesigned rear panel, with new, rectangular light clusters.

Including the S1A and S1B (which incorporated some of the later S2 changes) variations, 644 Europa S1s were manufactured.

===Series 2===
The Europa Series 2, or Lotus Type 54, was introduced in April 1968 (approximately chassis number 0645 onwards). The S2 used the same 1,470 cc Renault engine and mechanical components as the earlier Series 1, but added a number of key refinements including opening electric windows, adjustable seats, a new fully carpeted interior and a polished wooden fascia panel for the dashboard. The most significant change was the switch from fully bonded construction to the use of bolt fasteners to attach the fibreglass body to the backbone steel frame. While reducing the torsional and flexural stiffness somewhat, the use of a separable body was welcomed by the automotive insurance industry as it greatly reduced the complexity and cost of making repairs to the vehicle.

Early examples of the S2 were externally almost identical to the S1 with the exception of the new windows. From early 1969, secondary front indicator lamp nacelles were added between the headlights, and larger door handles were used in place of the S1&#x27;s push-button items. During 1968 a number of Europas (and Elans) were produced bearing black-and-silver Lotus badges on the nose and steering wheel in place of the customary yellow-and-green ones. The official Lotus Cars website states these &quot;black-badge&quot; vehicles were to commemorate the death earlier in 1968 of Jim Clark, Lotus&#x27;s champion Formula One driver, however this is debated by other sources.

Contemporary road tests for the Europa S2 recorded a top speed around 120 mph (195 km/h), 0-60 mph acceleration times of 9.3 seconds, standing 1/4 mile times of around 16.7 seconds, and an overall economy of around 30 mpg (9.4 L/100 km).

===United States===

A small number of Series 2 vehicles were modified to be &quot;federalized&quot; for export to the United States. These Federal Type 54s had the low front fenders (guards) of the European model and the larger 1,565 cc engine of the later Lotus Type 65. In 1969–70, the Type 65 (also known as S2 Federal) was introduced specifically for export to the U.S., with additional changes to the body, chassis, suspension and the powerplant to better comply with U.S. D.O.T. standards. Among the changes, the engine was a slightly modified emission controlled Renault 16TL 1,565 cc unit rated at 80 hp rather than the 1,470 cc engine of the Type 54. The front suspension was changed to make the front end of the car taller along with taller front fenders to raise the headlamps. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine tested the Federal S2 and recorded 0-60 mph acceleration time of 9.6 seconds with a top speed of .

In total, Lotus produced 3,615 Europa S2s.

===Twin Cam and Special===
In 1971, the Type 74 Europa Twin Cam was made available to the public, with a 105 hp 1,557 cc Lotus-Ford Twin Cam engine (113 hp US &quot;Federal&quot; version with standard emissions control and Big Valve engine with Stromberg carburetors, until the end of production) and a re-designed bodyshell to improve rearward visibility. Initially it was available with the same gearbox as the earlier cars, once the supply had been exhausted in 1972 a new stronger Renault four-speed gearbox (Type 352) was introduced. Mike Kimberley, who rose to become chief executive of Group Lotus, then a new engineer at Lotus, was appointed Chief Engineer of the Europa TC project. 1,580 cars were shipped as Europa &quot;Twin Cam&quot; before Lotus switched to a 126 hp &quot;Big Valve&quot; version of the engine.

In Europe and rest of the world markets, the Big Valve &quot;Europa Special&quot; version was aspirated by a Dell&#x27;Orto carburettored version of the same engine; it also offered a new Renault five-speed (Type 365) gearbox option. It weighed ; &quot;Motor&quot; magazine tested a UK Special to a top speed of , recorded a 0–60 mph acceleration time in 6.6 seconds, and ran the 1/4 mile in 14.9 seconds. In the US version of the Europa Special, where the Federalized version of the Big Valve had already been introduced earlier in the Twin Cam model, the only changes were larger brakes and the optional five-speed transmission which would become standard on the special in 1974.


Introduced in September 1972, the first 100 Lotus Europa JPS Specials were badged and painted to honour Team Lotus&#x27;s F1 World Championship title win with John Player Special as the team’s sponsor. All with a five-speed gearbox and Big Valve engine the original Specials were painted black with a gold pin stripe matching the livery of the GP cars – plus a numbered JPS dashboard badge. These were the first John Player Special commemorative Lotus production vehicles. The &quot;Special&quot; name and colour scheme was planned to be dropped after the commemorative cars, with Lotus reverting to the Twin Cam name, but such was the positive reaction to the new car that the name and the black and gold pin stripe colour scheme continued until the end of Europa production although colours other than black were made available.

In the end the numbered dashboard plaque distinguished the first, original, 100 JPS cars from other black Europa Specials.

In total 4,710 Type 74s were produced, of which 3,130 were badged &quot;Specials&quot;.
===Type 47 and 62===
Although the original Europa was intended as a clubman&#x27;s sports racer to replace the Lotus 7, it was realised that the car would be uncompetitive with the Renault engines available. A decision was therefore made to manufacture a specialist race car based on the Europa to be raced by Team Lotus and sold to private entrants. Although the very first Type 47 was based on a modified Europa, all subsequent cars were produced entirely by Lotus Components rather than the main factory. Launched at the same time as the S1 Europa, the body of the 47 was thinner than the standard Europa and with larger wheel arches. Side vents into the engine bay were added after the first few cars experienced problems with engine bay temperature.

The engine, gearbox and rear suspension were completely different from the standard Europa and were taken in their entirety from the Lotus 23/Lotus 22 Formula Junior cars with a Lotus-Ford Twin Cam based 165 hp (123 kW) 1,594 cc Cosworth Mk.XIII dry sump engine, and a Hewland FT 200 five-speed gearbox and suspension with reversed bottom wishbone, top link and dual radius arms. The front upright was specially cast in common with the F2 version of Lotus 41X to accommodate larger Girling brakes for the later 47A model (which had the Alfa Romeo tail lamp shared with the Europa S2) with reinforced front frame.

The Type 47 exact production numbers are unknown, the last car was 47GT-85 but it is unlikely that 85 47GT&#x27;s were produced, estimates vary from 55 to 68 during the years 1966–70. Although the 47GT is the best known, a few 47F&#x27;s were produced, these had the detachable body similar to the S2 Europa, but retaining the large wheel arches and side vents of the 47GT. Fitted with a tuned Ford cross flow engine but with the Renault gearbox and rear suspension of the Europa. At the request of parts supplier GKN, Lotus built the 47D as a show car. The 47D has a slightly enlarged chassis and body to fit a Rover V8 engine. At the time the 47D was built, it was capable of in 10 seconds.

As a mobile test bed for the new 2-litre Lotus 907 engine being developed for the forthcoming Elite and Eclat, the Type 62 was produced. Only two such cars were ever made. These were space frame cars with F1 suspension to handle the 240 hp power output from the engine. Although deliberately made to resemble the Europa, in practice the only connection to the Europa was a few of the Europa&#x27;s body panels. It won its class in its first event the 1969 BOAC 500 at Brands Hatch with John Miles and Brian Muir at the wheel. Replica 47&#x27;s and 62&#x27;s are bespoke-manufactured by Banks Europa Engineering, in several variations. 
===Specials===
Throughout its life, the Europa attracted the attention of many Lotus and non-Lotus automotive customising businesses who offered &quot;special&quot; versions in small numbers to the public. Among these was the Swiss Lotus importer, who made two special versions of the S2 fitted with the Renault 16 TS type 807 engine, the &quot;Europa Hemi 807&quot; and the fuel injected &quot;Europa Black Shadow 807&quot;. The Hemi 807 had SAE and could attain a speed of , while the Black Shadow had power output of . The Black Shadow also received a five-speed gearbox. These cars had a wider track, special wheels and stickers, white indicator lights up front, and featured extractor vents high on the side panel behind the rear door. The fuel injection system was from Kugelfischer. In 1971 two Lotus Hemi were entered as Group 4 GTS at the international hill climb race St. Ursanne Les Rangiers and Ollon-Villars driven by the Swiss drivers Oskar Bubeck and Alfons Tresch.

Chip Foose the famous automobile pioneer of United States also modified and restored a Lotus Europa for Episode 6 of the season 11 of his popular show &quot;Overhaulin&#x27;&quot;. It was one of the most time-consuming and complicated build of the show, where a brand new 1.8 litre four cylinder engine from an Elise was fitted into the car, while the power is handled by Porsche Boxster transmission. The bumpers were also tucked in signature Foose style.

in 1972 a Bristol based company called GS Cars produced a variant of the Lotus Europa. This version is based on the standard Lotus Europa Twin Cam, but has new bodywork which bears some resemblance to the Maserati Merak. The GS Lotus Europa was limited to 17 units. However, only five are known to still exist.

==Europa S (2006–2010)==

In 2005, Lotus released images of a new GT type car called the Lotus Europa S. Based on the Lotus Elise, the car was officially introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show.
Production commenced in July 2006 and continued until 2010. The engine was a turbocharged four cylinder, rated at at 5,400 rpm, with a maximum torque of at 5,400 rpm. The Europa S could accelerate from in 5.6 seconds ( in 5.8 seconds), with a maximum speed of . Lotus did not export the Europa S to the United States. Despite this, the American manufacturer Dodge developed an electric vehicle based on the Europa, known as the Dodge Circuit, which it planned to bring to the US market by 2010, but the project was cancelled in May 2009.

The Europa SE was unveiled at the Geneva International Motor Show on 5 March 2008. The SE was an upgraded model with more comfort in mind, intended to bring in more customers. The SE has the same engine as the S but it was modified to bring power to and torque to .

<text>Soyuz TM-19 was a crewed Soyuz spaceflight to Mir. It launched on 1 July 1994, at 12:24:50 UTC.

==Crew==
==Mission highlights==
Commander Malenchenko and Flight Engineer Musabayev, both spaceflight rookies, were to have been launched with veteran cosmonaut Gennadi Strekalov, who would have returned to Earth with Viktor Afanasyev and Yuri Usachov in Soyuz TM-18 after a few days on Mir. However, the cancellation of one of two Progress-M cargo ships scheduled to resupply Mir during the Agat crew&#x27;s stay meant that Strekalov&#x27;s couch had to carry supplies. The result was the first all-rookie Soyuz flight since Soyuz 25 in October 1977. Docking occurred without incident on July 3. Both cosmonauts and Doctor Valeri Polyakov (who had arrived on Soyuz TM-18) became the 16th resident crew; many technical problems with the station arose during this expedition, necessitating a previously untried manual supply docking by Malenchenko. On November 3, Malenchenko, Musabayev and Merbold undocked in Soyuz TM-19 and backed 190m from Mir. They then activated the Kurs automatic approach system, which successfully redocked the spacecraft. The cosmonauts then transferred back to Mir. The test was related to the difficulties Soyuz TM-20 and Progress M-24 experienced during their automatic approaches. Final undocking and reentry occurred the following day without incident.

==Mission accomplishments==
*Docked with Mir
*Partial crew exchange
*Conducted medical experiments
*Conducted materials experiments
*Malenchenko and Musabayev perform EVA on 09.09.1994 (5h 6m) to repair station&#x27;s external insulation
*Both cosmonauts repeat EVA on 14.09.1994 (6h 1m) for same purpose
*First successful manual docking of a Progress supply ship

<text>The 1993 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) season. The 90th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the defending World Series champion and American League (AL) champion Toronto Blue Jays and the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Blue Jays defeated the Phillies in six games, becoming the seventh franchise in MLB history to win back-to-back championships.

With Toronto ahead three games to two in the Series, but trailing Game 6 by a score of 6–5 in the bottom of the ninth inning, Joe Carter hit a game-winning three-run home run to clinch Toronto&#x27;s second consecutive championship (the first team to repeat as champions since the 1977–78 Yankees).

This was only the second Series concluded by such a home run (the first was on a Bill Mazeroski home run for the Pittsburgh Pirates, in the bottom of the ninth in the seventh game of the 1960 World Series), and the first such occasion where a come-from-behind walk-off home run won a World Series. This victory, along with the Montreal Canadiens winning the Stanley Cup four months earlier, was the last major North American professional sports championship won by a Canadian team until Toronto FC won the MLS Cup in 2017.

This was the fourth World Series with games played entirely on artificial turf, following the series of , , and . A fifth occurred in , although that was a neutral-site series during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sixth would be the 2023 World Series. 

Larry Andersen was the only member of the Phillies who had played for the team in its previous World Series appearance in (although he played for several other teams from 1986 to 1992). Darren Daulton had been a late season call-up in 1983, but only served as the bullpen catcher in the World Series that year.

To date, this remains Toronto’s last World Series victory and appearance.

==Summary==

==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The Series&#x27; first game sent two staff aces—Curt Schilling for Philadelphia and Juan Guzman for Toronto—against one another. The result was less than a pitcher&#x27;s duel, however, as both teams scored early and often. The Philles struck first in the top of the first on RBI singles by John Kruk and Darren Daulton aided by two walks. In the bottom of the second, after two singles and a wild pitch, Paul Molitor&#x27;s single and Tony Fernandez&#x27;s groundout scored a run each to tie the game. The Phillies took a 3–2 lead in the third inning when Mariano Duncan hit a leadoff single, stole second and scored on Kruk&#x27;s single, but the Blue Jays tied the game in the bottom half of the inning when Devon White reached third base on left fielder&#x27;s Milt Thompson&#x27;s error and scored on Joe Carter&#x27;s sacrifice fly. The Phillies retook the lead in the fifth inning when Duncan tripled with one out and scored on a wild pitch, but White hit a home run to tie the game in the bottom of the inning. The next inning, John Olerud hit a home run to put Toronto on top 5–4. In the seventh, after two one-out singles, Schilling was relieved by David West, who allowed an RBI double to White and two-run double to Roberto Alomar to pad Toronto&#x27;s lead to 8–4. The Phillies got a run in the ninth when Kruk hit a leadoff single, moved to second on an error and scored on Jim Eisenreich&#x27;s two-out single, but Duane Ward got Ricky Jordan to fly out to end the game as Toronto won 8–5. Al Leiter pitched innings—in relief of an erratic Juan Guzman, who walked four in just five innings—for his first World Series win. Kruk had three hits for Philadelphia. Alomar made an amazing diving catch on a Lenny Dykstra looper behind first in the top of the fifth.

===Game 2===
In the second game of the Series, ALCS MVP Dave Stewart was on the mound for Toronto and Terry Mulholland started for Philadelphia. Philadelphia jumped out to an early lead: in the third inning, After two walks, John Kruk and Dave Hollins hit back-to-back RBI singles, then Jim Eisenreich followed with a three-run home run to deep right-center to put them up 5–0. Toronto got on the scoreboard in the fourth inning courtesy of a Joe Carter two-run home run to left, then cut the Phillies&#x27; lead to 5–3 in the sixth when Roberto Alomar singled with two outs and scored on Tony Fernandez&#x27;s double, but the Phillies got that run back in the seventh on Lenny Dykstra&#x27;s home run off Tony Castillo. Toronto cut the lead to 6–4 in the eighth when Paul Molitor hit a leadoff double off Roger Mason, stole third and scored on John Olerud&#x27;s sacrifice fly off Mitch Williams. Alomar then walked and stole second, but was caught stealing third to end the inning. Williams then pitched a scoreless ninth as the Phillies won to tie the series. Mulholland pitched innings, allowing three earned runs, for the win.

===Game 3===
As he had in the preceding World Series, when the 1993 edition moved into the National League ballpark Toronto manager Cito Gaston was faced with a decision regarding his designated hitter. In 1992, Dave Winfield was Gaston’s regular DH but in the three games the series was played in Atlanta, he inserted him into the lineup in his natural position of right field; in two of those games Gaston moved his regular right fielder, Joe Carter, to first base and kept John Olerud out of his lineup. This time, with Paul Molitor in his lineup, Gaston again had to decide whether or not to keep Olerud, who led the major leagues with a .363 batting average and was a good defensive first baseman, in the lineup or replace him with the veteran Molitor, who at this point in his career had mostly been a regular DH and could only play first base if needed. Against a left-handed pitcher, Gaston decided to stick with the right-handed veteran Molitor, but had left-hitting Olerud on the bench if needed later in the game.

The Blue Jays sent future Cy Young winner Pat Hentgen to the mound for Game 3. The Phillies countered with veteran Danny Jackson, who was one of the few Phillies that had pitched in a World Series; he was part of the 1985 Kansas City and 1990 Cincinnati teams that won World Series championships.

The Blue Jays struck for two runs before recording an out. After Rickey Henderson’s leadoff single and Devon White’s walk, Molitor tripled to drive them both in. Joe Carter then extended the Toronto lead to 3–0 with a sacrifice fly, but Jackson got out of the inning by retiring Roberto Alomar and Tony Fernandez.

The Phillies got two runners in scoring position with one out in their half of the first, with Mariano Duncan and John Kruk singling and an error by Carter enabling both runners to advance a base. Hentgen ended the threat by striking out Dave Hollins and Darren Daulton; the Phillies only got one more man on base before the sixth inning.

Molitor struck again with two out in the fourth, hitting a solo home run to extend the lead to four. Carter, Alomar, and Fernandez followed with singles to load the bases, but Jackson struck out Ed Sprague Jr. to end the inning without further damage. Jackson would be lifted for a pinch hitter in the fifth.

In the sixth, Phillies reliever Ben Rivera gave up a leadoff single to Alomar. With Fernandez up, the speedy second baseman stole second and third and scored on a sacrifice fly by his double-play partner. The Phillies got on the board in the bottom of the inning on a single by Jim Eisenreich that drove in Kruk. This was Hentgen’s last inning of work; Danny Cox would come on for the seventh.

In the top of the seventh, Henderson hit a leadoff double, then scored on a triple by White. After a walk by Molitor and a Carter strikeout, Alomar&#x27;s RBI single made it 7–1 in favor of Toronto. Bobby Thigpen relieved Rivera and walked Fernandez before Sprague&#x27;s sacrifice fly made it 8–1.

The Phillies managed a run off Cox in the seventh, with a string of singles by Milt Thompson, Lenny Dykstra, and Duncan with one out resulting in Thompson scoring. The Blue Jays finished their offensive output in the top of the ninth with an RBI triple by Alomar that scored Molitor and a single by Fernandez that followed to bring in Alomar. Thompson hit a solo home run against Toronto closer Duane Ward in the bottom of the ninth to finish out the scoring, and the Blue Jays emerged with a 10–3 victory and a two-games-to-one lead in the series.

===Game 4===
In the fourth game of the Series, Toronto sent Todd Stottlemyre to the mound while Philadelphia countered with Tommy Greene. It had been a rainy day in Philadelphia, which water-logged the aging turf at Veterans Stadium, making for particularly slippery conditions.

Toronto loaded the bases in the first on a double, walk and single. Paul Molitor walked to force in a run before Tony Fernandez&#x27;s single scored two more. In the bottom half, three walks loaded the bases for the Phillies before Jim Eisenreich walked to force in a run, then Milt Thompson&#x27;s three-run triple put the Phillies up 4–3. Lenny Dykstra&#x27;s two-run home run next inning made it 6–3 Phillies. In the top of the third, after a one-out walk and single, consecutive RBI singles by Tony Fernandez and Pat Borders cut the lead to 6–5. Roger Mason relieved Greene and after a groundout and walk, Devon White&#x27;s two-run single put Toronto up 7–6, but the Phillies tied the game in the fourth when Dykstra doubled with two outs off Al Leiter and scored on Mariano Duncan&#x27;s single. Next inning, after a leadoff single, Darren Daulton&#x27;s two-run home run put the Phillies up 9–7. After another single, Thompson&#x27;s RBI double made it 10–7, then Dykstra&#x27;s second home run of the game made it 12–7 Phillies.

In the sixth, White hit a leadoff double before scoring on Roberto Alomar&#x27;s single off David West. After a single and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, Fernandez&#x27;s RBI groundout cut the Phillies&#x27; lead to 12–9, but they added a run in the bottom half when Dave Hollins hit a leadoff double off Tony Castillo and scored on Thompson&#x27;s two-out single. Next inning, a hit-by-pitch to Daulton with the bases loaded made it 14–9 Phillies. In the eighth, though, after a one-out single and walk off Larry Andersen, Molitor&#x27;s RBI double made it 14–10 Phillies. Fernandez then hit an RBI single off Mitch Williams. A walk loaded the bases, then after a strikeout, Rickey Henderson&#x27;s single and White&#x27;s triple scored two runs each to put Toronto ahead 15–14. Duane Ward earned the save, retiring the last four Phillies batters.

Three new World Series records were set, including the longest game (4:14), most total runs scored in a single game (29), and most runs scored by a losing team (14). Also, Charlie Williams became the first African American to serve as the home plate umpire for a World Series game.

Two death threats directed towards Mitch Williams were phoned into Veterans Stadium as soon as it became evident that Williams was going to be the losing pitcher of Game 4. Williams was not aware of the death threats until after Game 5.

===Game 5===
The offenses were due for an off-day, and it came in Game 5 courtesy of a Curt Schilling (Philadelphia) and Juan Guzman (Toronto) pitching duel. With the Phillies&#x27; backs to the wall, Schilling shut down the previously unstoppable Toronto offense, limiting the team to just five hits, three walks, no extra-base hits (although catcher Pat Borders had two hits) and no runs in a complete-game shutout. It was only the second time all season that Toronto had been shut out. Guzman pitched well in a losing effort, allowing only two runs and five hits in seven innings of work.

The two runs scored as a result of scrappy baserunning play from the Philadelphia offense. In the first inning, Lenny Dykstra walked, stole second, moved to third on a Pat Borders throwing error during the steal, and scored on a John Kruk ground out. In the second inning, Darren Daulton opened with a double, took third on a groundout, and scored on a Kevin Stocker single.

As it turned out, it was the final postseason baseball game in Veterans Stadium. It was demolished after the 2003 season.

===Game 6===
The sixth game in the Series was a rematch between Game 2 starters Terry Mulholland and Dave Stewart, who would have similar results. Toronto scored in the bottom of the first with a run-scoring Paul Molitor triple after a walk, Joe Carter sacrifice fly to score Molitor, and Roberto Alomar RBI single after a double. The Phillies got on the board in the fourth when Darren Daulton doubled with two outs and scored on Jim Eisenreich&#x27;s single, but the Blue Jays got that run back in the bottom of the inning on when Alomar hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Ed Sprague Jr.&#x27;s sacrifice fly. Paul Molitor added a home run in the fifth inning while the Toronto fans were chanting &quot;MVP&quot; for Paul, bringing the score to 5–1 for Toronto. Molitor became the first player in World Series history to have at least two home runs, two doubles, and two triples.

In the seventh inning, Philadelphia fought back with five runs. After a walk and single, Lenny Dykstra hit a three-run home run to knock Stewart out of the game. Mariano Duncan singled off reliever Danny Cox, stole second, and scored on Dave Hollins&#x27;s RBI single to tie the game. A walk and single loaded the bases before Pete Incaviglia hit a sacrifice fly to put the Phillies up 6–5.

The Blue Jays would try to threaten in the bottom of the eighth. John Olerud drew a one-out walk and the Phillies brought in Larry Andersen to face Roberto Alomar. After Alomar grounded out, Andersen then hit Tony Fernandez with a pitch and walked Ed Sprague Jr. to load the bases. Andersen got out of the inning by inducing a pop-fly to Pat Borders. This became significant in the next inning, with the batting order reset to the top with Rickey Henderson leading off.

Philadelphia closer Mitch Williams came on to pitch the bottom of the ninth with his team clinging to a 6–5 lead. After beginning the inning by walking Rickey Henderson, Williams tried to counter Henderson&#x27;s speed by using a slide-step style of pitching delivery. Prior to the game, Williams had never used the slide-step delivery in his career, and this may have cut back on his velocity. The walk to Henderson was followed by a Devon White flyout and a Paul Molitor single that moved Henderson to second.
Joe Carter came up next and, with the count 2–2, he hit a three-run home run to win the game and the World Series. Just before the fifth and final pitch to Joe Carter, CBS Sports announcer Tim McCarver commented that Carter (relatively unproductive in the Series to date) looked awkward and uncomfortable at the plate. The same pitch allowed Blue Jays radio announcer Tom Cheek the opportunity to utter his famous &quot;Touch &#x27;em all, Joe&quot; quote, when Joe Carter clinched the series. Carter joined Bill Mazeroski as the only two players to win a World Series with a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning (Mazeroski hit his home run in the deciding Game 7, while Carter hit his in Game 6).

Carter was actively involved in the final play of the World Series for the second year in a row. In the previous year, Carter caught the final out as first baseman after relief pitcher Mike Timlin fielded Otis Nixon&#x27;s bunt. Taking the 1993 ALCS into account (where he caught the final out in the outfield), he had been involved in the final play of three straight postseason championship series.

American League president Dr. Bobby Brown presented the World Series Trophy instead of the Commissioner of Baseball; this event also occurred in the year before.

1993 World Series (4–2): Toronto Blue Jays (A.L.) over Philadelphia Phillies (N.L.)
==Aftermath==
The Blue Jays became the second expansion team to win two World Series championships, following the New York Mets in . This has since been achieved by the Florida Marlins in , the Kansas City Royals in , and the Houston Astros in . With the Montreal Canadiens winning the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals five months earlier, it marked the only time Canadian teams won multiple league championships among the four major North American team sports in a calendar year.

Mitch Williams would later place blame on himself for the World Series loss:

::—Mitch Williams on his feelings about surrendering the home run to Joe Carter. Williams would be traded that off-season by the Phillies to the Astros.

Roger Angell&#x27;s review of the World Series in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was entitled &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War&quot;.

When Joe Carter appeared in the 1996 All-Star Game at Veterans Stadium, he was booed by the crowd for his aforementioned home run that won him this World Series.

Both teams would experience absences from the postseason; the Phillies did not return to the postseason until 2007, or appear in another World Series until their championship season of , bringing the city of Philadelphia its first championship since the 76ers swept the 1983 NBA Finals. The general manager of the Blue Jays, Pat Gillick, was general manager of the Phillies team that won the 2008 World Series. The Blue Jays did not qualify for the playoffs again until the 2015 season. This was the last time a Toronto team made it to the championship round in one of the four major sports until the Toronto Raptors in their championship season.

By accumulating 45 runs over the course of the series, the Blue Jays scored the highest number of runs of any &quot;series-winning&quot; team in World Series history. Only the series-losing 1960 New York Yankees accumulated more runs in a series (55). Coincidentally, that series also ended on a walk-off home run.

1993 was the last postseason played under a two-division, two post-season round format. After the season, MLB owners agreed to a new three-division setup, with extra post-season round (League Division Series). The extra round format had been used once before during the 1981 strike shortened season.

==Broadcasting==
CBS Sports covered the World Series on television for the fourth consecutive year; it was also the final World Series in CBS&#x27;s contract to air Major League Baseball games. For the second consecutive year, Sean McDonough served as lead announcer, with Tim McCarver serving as analyst for the fourth consecutive year. Pregame and postgame shows saw Andrea Joyce and Pat O&#x27;Brien as hosts, while Lesley Visser and Jim Gray were field level reporters. 

CBS Radio was once again the nationwide radio partner for the World Series. Vin Scully led the broadcast for a fourth consecutive year, with Johnny Bench serving as analyst for the fifth and last time. John Rooney served as the pregame and postgame show host. 

Locally, the World Series was called on WOGL-AM in Philadelphia by Harry Kalas, Richie Ashburn, Chris Wheeler, Andy Musser, and Garry Maddox and on CJCL-AM in Toronto by Jerry Howarth and Tom Cheek. Cheek&#x27;s famous call of the Carter home run (&quot;Touch &#x27;em all Joe, you&#x27;ll never hit a bigger home run in your life!&quot;) lives on in Blue Jays folklore. Tom Cheek never called another postseason game in his role as voice of the Blue Jays, from which he retired in 2005 prior to his death from brain cancer.

The 1993 series was Richie Ashburn&#x27;s last as a Phillies broadcaster, as he died in 1997. Andy Musser also called his last World Series as a member of the Phillies&#x27; broadcast team; he retired in 2001 and died eleven years later. Game 6 also marked Johnny Bench&#x27;s final broadcast for CBS Radio after nine years (he would be replaced on CBS Radio&#x27;s World Series broadcasts by Jeff Torborg), while Harry Kalas would not call another World Series until 2008. Kalas later died in 2009 prior to a game at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Chris Wheeler continued to call games for the Phillies until being released in 2014 and Jerry Howarth continued to call Blue Jays games, moving into the primary play-by-play position following the death of Cheek, until his retirement before the 2018 season. Howarth would return to call postseason games when the Blue Jays qualified in 2015 and 2016, where they were eliminated in the ALCS both years.

===The Joe Carter home run calls===
*CBS Radio, with Vin Scully:

::&quot;Fastball, it&#x27;s hit to left field, down the line, in the corner, home run! Joe Carter who took the 2 and 0 pitch for a strike right down the middle hits the 2 and 1 (sic) pitch over the left field wall and the Toronto Blue Jays come back with 3 in the bottom of the ninth inning to become the World Champions yet again. The final score: Toronto 8, Philadelphia 6.&quot;

*CJCL-AM Radio in Toronto by Tom Cheek:

::&quot;Joe has had his moments. Trying to lay off that ball, low to the outside part of the plate, he just went after one. Two balls and two strikes on him. Here&#x27;s a pitch on the way, a swing and a belt! Left field, way back, BLUE JAYS WIN IT! The Blue Jays are World Series champions, as Joe Carter hits a three-run home run in the ninth inning and the Blue Jays have repeated as World Series champions! Touch &#x27;em all, Joe, you&#x27;ll never hit a bigger home run in your life!&quot;

*WOGL-AM Radio in Philadelphia by Harry Kalas:

::&quot;The 2–2 pitch, line drive in deep left, this ball is outta here. Three-run home run, Joe Carter, and the Toronto Blue Jays are the world champions of baseball for the second straight year. A three-run home run in the bottom of the ninth by Joe Carter who&#x27;s being mobbed at home plate.&quot;

*CBS Television. Sean McDonough:

::&quot;Now the 2-2. Well-hit down the left-field line, way back and GONE! Joe Carter with a three-run homer! The winners and still world champions, the Toronto Blue Jays!&quot;

==Music==

The West Chester University &quot;Incomparable&quot; Golden Rams Marching Band performed the pregame show for Game 3.

Toronto rapper Choclair refers to Joe Carter&#x27;s walk-off home run in his 1999 song, &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride&quot;.

On July 29, 2015, Toronto rapper Drake released a diss track against Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill entitled &quot;Back to Back&quot;. The cover of the diss track features a picture of Joe Carter, just after hitting the series-clinching home run.

<text>James Layton Ralston (September 27, 1881 – May 22, 1948) was a Canadian lawyer, soldier, and politician. A Nova Scotian and a lawyer by training, Ralston fought with distinction during the First World War and pursued a career in the Canadian Army, before becoming a Liberal Member of Parliament. During the Second World War, he served as Minister of National Defence from 1940 to 1944, when he was forced to resign by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King because of his support for the introduction of conscription.

== Early life and provincial politics ==
Ralston was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia, the eldest son (he had three brothers) of Burnett William Ralston, a prominent local businessman who served a term as the town&#x27;s mayor. Known as Layton within the family, Ralston was educated at Amherst Academy and the law school at Dalhousie University. He then became a partner in his uncle&#x27;s law firm in 1903 and practised law in Amherst.

Ralston was the Liberal candidate for Cumberland in the 1908 federal election, hoping to succeed to his uncle, Hance James Logan; but was defeated. He subsequently entered public life when he ran as the provincial Liberal candidate for Cumberland and was elected in the 1911 provincial election. He was re-elected in 1916.

In 1912, seeking greater opportunities, Ralston moved to Halifax, joining his friend Charles Burchell and A.K. Maclean, MP to form one of the city&#x27;s main law firms.

== Military service ==
In his 30s at the outbreak of the First World War and lacking military experience, Ralston agonized about joining the Army. After training with the Canadian Officers’ Training Corps, he volunteered for military service overseas in 1915, following the lead of his brother Ivan. Joining the 85th Battalion (Nova Scotia Highlanders), he was involved in recruitment and became the battalion&#x27;s adjutant in 1916.

Along with the 85th, Ralston went to England in 1916 and to France in 1917, where he distinguished himself in combat. In 1917, he was wounded at Éleu-dit-Leauwette, received the Distinguished Service Order and was mentioned in despatches. In 1918, he assumed command of the 85th and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. The same year, Ralston was recommended for the Victoria Cross after rescuing a subaltern under fire. The recommendation was turned down by higher authority, since as the unit&#x27;s commanding officer he should not have been risking his life that way.

He was wounded again in August 1918, this time by a sniper, at the Battle of Amiens, in which his brother Ivan, who was his second-in-command, was killed. In a letter to his parents, Ralston said that &quot;The sun has gone out of life in an instant&quot;.

Returning to the front, Ralston was wounded again on 1 October, at the Battle of the Canal du Nord. For his part in the battle, he received a bar to his DSO. In later October, he was wounded a fourth time. The wound having infected, he was operated on twice, and the time he spent in hospital meant that he did not take part in the Hundred Days Offensive.

After the Armistice, Ralston briefly served as an acting brigade commander in Belgium. That year, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and was mentioned in despatches again. In 1919, he attended the Paris Peace Conference as a guest of General Sir Arthur Currie. After serving on some of the courts-martial convened after the Kinmel Park mutiny in April 1919, he led his unit back to Canada in June 1919. He was promoted to colonel in 1924.

Ralston&#x27;s military service marked him deeply, and he was unrelenting in his defence of veterans&#x27; rights after the war&#x27;s end. As the chairman of the Royal Commission on Pensions and Re-establishment from 1922 to 1924, he crossed the country to hear veterans&#x27; submissions. His war service may also have influenced his views during the Conscription Crisis of 1944 later in his career.

== Federal politics ==
After the war, Ralston returned to civilian life. He lost his provincial seat in the 1920 election, then tried unsuccessfully to enter federal politics as the Liberal candidate for Halifax in the 1926 federal election. Despite his loss, Ralston was appointed to the cabinet by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and became the Minister of National Defence on October 8. Prime Minister King created a seat for Ralston by appointing the MP for Shelburne—Yarmouth, Paul Lacombe Hatfield, to the Senate, thus opening the riding for a by-election. Ralston won by acclamation on November 2, 1926, entering the 16th Parliament.

Ralston served as Minister of National Defence until the defeat of King&#x27;s government in the 1930 federal election but was re-elected and remained the MP for Shelburne-Yarmouth through the 17th Parliament, serving in His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition. In 1930, he moved to Montreal to join a law firm there, Mitchell, Ralston, Kearney and Duquet.

The riding of Shelburne-Yarmouth was consolidated into the new riding of Shelburne—Yarmouth—Clare in 1935 and Ralston opted to not run again, returning to the legal profession full-time, despite the Liberal party regaining power and Mackenzie King&#x27;s entreaties, going so far as to refuse a seat in the Senate in 1937. Ralston was appointed the Canadian delegate to the London Naval Conference 1935 that December, and he later sat on several Royal Commissions.

=== Second World War ===
Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939 and Canada&#x27;s entry into World War II was seen as inevitable. The ensuing international crisis saw Prime Minister King court Ralston&#x27;s military and cabinet experience. Having promised Mackenzie King in August 1939 that he would return to government service if war broke out, Ralston re-entered public service and he was subsequently appointed as Minister of Finance on September 6, 1939, replacing Charles Dunning who resigned because of ill-health.

Canada declared war on Nazi Germany on September 10 and Ralston participated in the King government&#x27;s revamping of Canada&#x27;s two-decade-long neglected military. The death of Alfred Edgar MacLean, MP for Prince on October 28 opened up the opportunity for Prime Minister King to call a by-election in a Liberal-friendly riding that Ralston could run in. Ralston was subsequently elected by acclamation on January 2, 1940 and entered the 18th Parliament. He was re-elected several months later on March 26 and continued into the 19th Parliament. In the political tradition of the era, as a federal minister, Ralston brought government patronage to the impoverished rural riding in Prince Edward Island, largely through military spending.

On June 10, 1940 the Minister of National Defence, Norman Rogers, was killed when his airplane crashed in Ontario. King subsequently shuffled the cabinet and gave Ralston the National Defence portfolio on July 5. Despite not being from Prince Edward Island, Ralston continued his support to that province as political minister by authorizing the establishment of RCAF Station Mount Pleasant, RCAF Station Summerside (both in his riding) and RCAF Station Charlottetown, as well as a radar station in Tignish (also in his riding).

=== Conscription Crisis ===

Ralston supported conscription for overseas service during the Second World War, just as he did during the First World War. In 1942 offered to resign when prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s government refused to send &quot;Zombies&quot;, men mobilized under the &quot;National Resources Mobilization Act&quot;, to the front. King refused Ralston&#x27;s resignation, and the resignation issue was dropped.

In 1944, the issue of conscription returned again to the public debate. Ralston decided to personally investigate the issue by visiting Northwest Europe and Italy. He reported to Cabinet that the situation was far worse than he had been led to believe; front-line infantry regiments were so short of manpower that wounded men were being pulled out of hospitals and sent back to the front lines. In order to continue combat operations, the overseas Canadian Army needed 15,000 new infantrymen immediately, and that the only way to get these replacements was to draw from the 60,000 Zombies assigned to defend the coasts.

King was convinced that there was a plot to &quot;get me out&quot; and that Ralston had provoked the crisis to make himself Prime Minister. When the Cabinet met on the morning of 1 November 1944, King, who had only informed his Quebec lieutenant Louis St. Laurent in advance, suddenly announced that he now accepted Ralston&#x27;s resignation, which had been submitted back in April 1942, effective firing him. To King&#x27;s relief, Ralston walked out of the cabinet room and no one followed him. Ralston&#x27;s ally, Navy Minister Angus Macdonald, ripped pieces of paper in frustration, but remained seated with the rest of the cabinet. He was replaced by Lieutenant-General Andrew McNaughton, who was opposed to sending the Zombies overseas. One of McNaughton&#x27;s first actions was to dismiss Lieutenant-General Kenneth Stuart, the Chief of the General Staff and Ralston&#x27;s ally in pressing for conscription.

Historians Jack Granatstein and Desmond Morton noted that &quot;news of Ralston&#x27;s sacking put the conscription crisis on the front pages in screaming headlines. To King&#x27;s horror and to McNaughton&#x27;s distress, the publicity created a firestorm of reaction against the once-popular general. Audiences booed and jeered when he tried to rally the country behind the no-conscription policy&quot;.

Ralston left politics the following year and died in Montreal in 1948.

== Family ==
In 1907, Ralston married Nettie McLeod, also from Amherst, whom he had known since childhood. They had one son, Stuart, born in 1908. Stuart Ralston later became a puisne judge of the Superior Court of Quebec.

== Legacy ==
Ralston was named a National Historic Person in 1973.

The Colonel James L. Ralston Armoury in Amherst, Nova Scotia is named in his honour and is the historic home of the Nova Scotia Highlanders Regiment.

A large tern schooner was named in his honour in 1919 at Eatonville, Nova Scotia.
Ralston, Alberta and the Ralston Residence at the Canadian Forces College in Toronto was completed in October 1999, and was named after him.

<text>Pointe-Claire (, ) is a Quebec local municipality within the Urban agglomeration of Montreal on the Island of Montreal in Canada. It is entirely developed, and land use includes residential, light manufacturing, and retail. As of the 2021 census the population was 33,488.

==Toponymy==
The toponym refers to the peninsula, or point, where the windmill, convent, and the Saint-Joachim de Pointe-Claire Church are sited. The point extends into Lac Saint-Louis and has a clear view of its surroundings.

==History==
Pointe-Claire was first described by Nicolas Perrot in his account of 1669, and the name Pointe-Claire appeared on a map as early as 1686. Although Samuel de Champlain canoed through the area in 1613, he reported no village or dwelling visible.

The urbanization of the territory of Pointe-Claire began in the 1600s, when the Sulpicians were lords of the island of Montreal. Land on the island of Montreal was granted to the Sulpicians for development as early as 1663. They began to grant concessions along major waterways.

In 1678, the first concession on the land under the seigneurial system was to Jean Guenet who named his property Beau Repaire. This was near the future village of Beaurepaire, located in what is now Beaconsfield. on June 4, 1910, the village of Beaconsfield separates from the parish of Saint-Joachim-de-la-Pointe-Claire

The first concession of land that is still in the current city limits of Pointe-Claire, was in 1684 to Pierre Cabassier, for a lot just east of Pointe Charlebois. Under the seigneurial system, the Sulpicians had to build a mill for the colonists, who in turn had to grind their grain there at a set fee.
The arrival of French settlers in Pointe-Claire began in 1698-1699.

In 1707, after the Great Peace of Montreal was signed in 1701, the Chemin du Roy (now Lakeshore Road) from Dorval to the western tip of Montreal Island was opened having been ordered by intendant Jacques Raudot, and the parish was subdivided in three côtes: St. Rémy (present-day Boulevard Des Sources), St. Jean, and St. Charles. Between côtes St. Rémy and St. Charles lay 33 lots (numbered 145 to 177). These were generally three arpents wide by 20 or 30 deep. Up to this time Pointe-Claire had only been accessible by boat.
On October 13, 1713, the seminary formed a parish on the land that now includes Pointe-Claire and much of the West Island, and in 1714 a church was built at the point, at the site of the present-day church. Up to that time the area was served by an itinerant missionary priest. Initially the church was called Saint-Francois-de-Sales, but it was renamed six months later to Saint-Joachim de la Pointe Claire. The church and presbytery, both built of stone, formed a fort about two arpents () in area, surrounded by stakes. The construction was ordered by Governor Beauharnois out of fear of the Iroquois. The point was used as a stopover by voyageurs en route to the interior.

In 1728–1729, the first lots were granted, near the fort, to a blacksmith and to a carpenter. By 1765 there were 783 residents, 74 lots owned by 35 individuals, and 19 houses, some built of stone, but most of wood.

On July 1, 1845, the Village Municipality of Saint-Joachim-de-la-Pointe-Claire was created, before losing its municipal status on September 1, 1847, as was common in Quebec for many local entities. On September 2, 1854, it was reestablished.

The Grand Trunk Railway built the railroad through the area in 1855, linking Pointe-Claire to Montreal. This brought people, and with them property development in an area that up to then had been largely agricultural. It also improved the welfare of farmers by providing a ready market for their goods. Suburban development began in 1893 when Otto Frederick Lilly acquired land spanning Boulevard Saint-Jean. He used his influence with the Canadian Pacific Railway to have a station added to the line at the end of Cedar Avenue, which he also paved from there down to Lakeshore Road. Both sides of Cedar Avenue were built up by 1920.

After the British North America Act of 1867, Pointe-Claire was included in the new federal riding of Jacques Cartier. In the election of 7 August, the men (suffrage did not extend to women until 1940) of Pointe-Claire elected the Conservative Guillaume Gamelin Gaucher.

In 1900, a major fire destroyed much of the village. The fire was discovered in an uninhabited building around 2:00 a.m., 22 May 1900. The wind caused the fire to spread to surrounding houses. The only water supply was from village wells or carried in buckets from the river. A small two-wheeled hose reel and hand pump was the only village fire protection. Locals failed to put out the fire and asked for help from Montreal. Equipment was sent by train but did not arrive in time to help. The worst of the damage was on the rue de l&#x27;église. In all about 30 buildings were destroyed, including the post office, the town hall, and the residences of about 200 people.

On March 14, 1911, the Village Municipality of Saint-Joachim-de-la-Pointe-Claire changed status and name to &quot;Ville&quot; (city/town) de Pointe-Claire.

Provincial highway number 2 (now Autoroute 20) was built alongside the railway in 1940, following expropriation of property. This led to a move of much of the town from the south to the north of the highway, namely the town hall, recreation centre, police station, and fire station.

In 1955, the City of Pointe-Claire annexed large portions of the Parish Municipality of Saint-Joachim-de-la-Pointe-Claire (which was formed on September 1, 1855). Remaining portions of the municipal parish became the Town of Kirkland on March 24, 1961. In 1958, a new City Hall was built and Pointe-Claire changed status from &quot;Ville&quot; to &quot;Cité&quot; (&quot;city&quot;), but in 1967, this was reverted.

From 2002 to 2006 there were municipal reorganizations across the province, which included a reorganization of Montreal; Pointe-Claire was merged into Montreal and became a borough. However, after political changes (2003 Quebec general election and the 2004 Quebec municipal referendums) it was re-constituted as an independent city in 2006, along with a number of other boroughs.

==Geography==

The shoreline of Pointe-Claire along Lake Saint-Louis is at about above sea level and rises along a fault by about not far from shore, more steeply in the west. The eastern side has a soil rich in clay, while the western side is stonier with limestone strata. Pointe-Claire is bounded on the north by Dollard-des-Ormeaux, on the east by Dorval, on the south by Lac Saint-Louis, and on the west by Kirkland and Beaconsfield.

Pointe-Claire is entirely urbanised and developed. There are 38 public parks and green spaces with 5 baseball/softball diamonds, 26 playgrounds, 19 soccer pitches, 7 outdoor swimming pools, 24 tennis courts, 10 outdoor skating rinks, and five shoreline areas.

Large green spaces include:
* The public Terra-Cotta Natural Park which is a natural green space of 39 hectares (96 acres), with six kilometers (4 miles) of paths. From 1912 to 1962, a clay deposit on the site was exploited by the Montréal Terra Cotta and Lumber Co. The clay, mixed with sawdust, was baked on site to produce hollow tiles used in construction. 
* The Last Post Fund National Field of Honour, a National Historic Site of Canada, which is open to the public.
* The private Beaconsfield Golf Course, on the site of a disused quarry which supplied limestone for the construction of the Victoria Bridge in 1860.

== Demographics ==
According to the Office québécois de la langue française, Pointe-Claire has been officially recognized as a bilingual municipality since 2 Nov 2005.

In the 2021 census conducted by Statistics Canada, Pointe-Claire had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="405303" wikidata="Q105628259" url="?curid=405303" title="Crusading movement">
<text>The crusading movement encompasses the framework of ideologies and institutions that described, regulated, and promoted the Crusades. The crusades were religious wars that the Christian Latin church initiated, supported, and sometimes directed during the Middle Ages. The members of the church defined this movement in legal and theological terms based on the concepts of holy war and pilgrimage. The movement merged ideas of Old Testament wars, that were believed to have had God&#x27;s support, with New Testament Christocentrism. Crusading as an institution began with the encouragement of the church reformers who had undertaken what is commonly known as the Gregorian Reform in the 11thcentury. It declined after the Reformation began during the early 16th century.

The idea of crusading as holy war was based on the Greco-Roman just war theory. This theory characterized a &quot;just war&quot; as one with a legitimate authority as the instigator, waged with a valid cause and good intentions. The crusades were seen by their adherents as a special Christian pilgrimagea physical and spiritual journey authorized and protected by the church. They were acts of both pilgrimage and penance. Participants were considered part of Christ&#x27;s army and demonstrated this by attaching crosses of cloth to their outfits. This marked them as followers and devotees of Christ, referencing biblical passages exhorting Christians &quot;to carry [their] cross and follow Christ&quot;. Everyone could be involved, with the church considering anyone who died campaigning a Christian martyr. This movement was an important part of late-medieval western culture: it impacted politics, the economy and wider society.

The original focus and objective of the crusading movement was to take Jerusalem and the sacred sites of Palestine from non-Christians. These locations were pivotal for the inception of the First Crusade and the subsequent establishment of crusading as an institution. The campaigns to reclaim the Holy Land were the ones that attracted the greatest support, but the crusading movement&#x27;s theatre of war extended wider than just Palestine. Crusades were waged in the Iberian Peninsula, in northeastern Europe against the Wends, and in the Baltic region; other campaigns were fought against those the church considered heretics in France, Germany, and Hungary, as well as in Italy against opponents of the popes. By definition, all crusades were waged with papal approval and through this reinforced the Western European concept of a single, unified Christian church under the Pope.
== Major features ==

Historians trace the beginnings of the crusading movement to the changes enacted within the Latin church during the mid and late 11th century. These are known as the Gregorian Reform, from a term popularized by the French historian Augustin Fliche. He named the changes after one of the leading reforming popes, Gregory VII. The use of the term oversimplifies what was in fact numerous discrete initiatives, not all of which were the result of papal action.

A group of reformers took control of the governance of the church with ambitions to use this control to eradicate behaviour they viewed as corrupt. This takeover was initially supported by the Holy Roman Empire and by Emperor Henry III in particular, but went on to lead to conflict with his son, Emperor Henry IV. The reformers believed in papal primacy, meaning the Pope was the head of all of Christendom as heir of St Peter. Secular rulers, including the emperor, were subject to this and could be removed.

The reformist groups opposed previously widespread behaviour such as the sale of clerical positions and clerical marriage. The changes were not without opposition, causing splits within the church and between the church and the emperor. However, the reform faction successfully created an ideology for the men they saw as God&#x27;s agents. From the second half of the 11thcentury, it empowered them to reshape the church according to the moral and spiritual principles they upheld. Historians consider that this was a pivotal moment, because the church was now under the control of men who supported a concept of holy war and would plan to make it happen.

The reformers now viewed the church as an independent force with God-given authority to act in the secular world for religious regeneration. The creation of the institutions of crusading were a means by which the church could act militarily with the support of the armed aristocracy. This would in turn lead to creation of formal processes for the raising of armed forces through which the church could enforce its will. While these fundamentals applied the crusading movement flourished, when they ceased to be significant the movement declined.

=== Penance and indulgence ===
Before the crusading movement was established, the church had developed a system that enabled Christians to gain forgiveness and pardon for sins from the church on behalf of God. They did this by demonstrating genuine contrition through admissions of wrongdoing and acts of penance. In the latter part of the 11thcentury, Christianity&#x27;s requirement to avoid violence was still a significant issue for the warrior class, so Gregory VII offered them a potential solution. This was that they too could have their sins forgiven if they supported him in fighting for papal causes, but only if this service was given altruistically. When Urban II launched the First Crusade at Clermont in November 1095, he made two offers to those who would travel to Jerusalem and fight for control of the sites Christians considered sacred. Firstly, those who fought would receive exemption from penance for the sins they committed. Secondly, while they were on crusade, the church would protect their property from harm. The enthusiasm of the crusading movement was a challenge to what had been conventional theology. A letter from Sigebert of Gembloux to Robert II, Count of Flanders, illustrates this point. Sigebert criticises Pope Paschal II and congratulates Robert on his safe return from Jerusalem but pointedly omits any reference to the fact that Robert had been on a crusade.

Later popes developed the institution further, declaring that crusaders would not only avoid divine punishment for their sins, but that their guilt and the sins themselves would be expunged. This was achieved by the church granting what was called a plenary indulgence. Calixtus II extended the same privileges and protections of property to crusaders&#x27; relations. Innocent III reinforced the importance of the oaths crusaders took. He also emphasised the view that the forgiveness of sin was a gift from God, not a reward for the suffering endured by the crusader while on crusade. It was in the 1213 papal bull called that he reached out beyond the noble warrior class, offering all Christians the opportunity to redeem their vows without going on crusade. The unforeseen consequence of this was the creation a market for religious rewards. Later, this scandalized some devout Christians and thus became a catalyst for the 16thcentury Reformation. At that time, some writers continued to seek atonement for their sins through the practice of crusading while John Foxe (the English martyrologist) and others saw this as &quot;the impure idolatry, and profanation&quot; 

Popes continued in the practice of issuing crusade bulls for generations, but Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius created an international rule of law that was secular rather than religious. The wars against the Ottoman Empire and in defence of Europe were conflicts on which Lutherans, Calvinists, and Roman Catholics could agree in principle. So the importance to recruitment of the granting of indulgences became increasingly redundant and declined.

=== Christianity and war ===


The 4th-century theologian Augustine of Hippo Christianized Graeco-Roman theories of or just war. In the 11th century, canon lawyers extended his thinking to create the paradigm of Christian (). This theory was based on the idea that if it met three criteria Christian warfare could be justified even though it was considered a sin. Firstly, it must be declared by an authority that the church considered legitimate. Secondly, the war must have defensive objectives or to be for the recovery of stolen property and rights. Lastly, the intentions of those taking part must be good. Using this justification the church supported various Christian groups in conflicts with their Muslim neighbours at the borders of Christendom. In what is now Northern Spain, encouragement was given during the siege of Barbastro; the Italo-Normans of Southern Italy were supported in their conquest of the Emirate of Sicily and in 1074 Gregory VII planned to lead a campaign himself in support of the Byzantine Empire. He was unable to gather the necessary support, possibly because his personal leadership was unacceptable. Despite this, his plans left a template for future crusades, as did the campaigns in Spain where leading thinkers and fighters developed practical and fundamental arguments for the crusading movement.

Around 1083, the thoughts and writing on these theories were consolidated into or &quot;Collection of Canon Law&quot; by Anselm of Lucca. Thomas Aquinas and others extended these theories in the 13thcentury into a concept of religious war. This enabled various popes to use canon law in the call for crusades against their enemies in Italy. The argument was that Rome was the estate of St Peter, so the popes&#x27; Italian campaigns were considered defensive and fought for the preservation of Christian territory. 

The thinking of church on these themes combined two ideas in the creation of crusading, one from the Old Testament and one from the New Testament. The first was that the wars of the Jews were believed to have been instigated by the will of God. The second was the Christocentric ideas related to Christians forming individual relationships with Christ that came from the New Testament. In this way the church was able to combine the ideas of holy war and Christian pilgrimage to create the legal and theocratic justifications for the crusading movement. The historian Carl Erdmann mapped out the three stages for the argument creating the institution of the crusading movement:
* Defending Christian unity was a just cause.
* Pope Gregory I and his followers&#x27; ideas for missionary conquest were also in accordance.
* Islam should be fought in defence of Christendom, an idea developed under the reformist popes Leo IX, Alexander II, and Gregory VII.

=== Knights, chivalry and the military orders ===

Innovations in military technology and thinking made the first crusades feasible. Military tactics developed to utilize heavily armoured cavalry and control of society was achieved by the development of castles. These required men for garrisons, the extensive training or which in turn created new social mores and led to the rise of combat as sport. At sea increasingly large navies were deployed, built by Italy&#x27;s maritime republics. At this time although knights were praised in literature they remained distinct from the aristocracy. Crusading and chivalry developed together, and in time chivalry helped shape the ethos, ideals and principles of crusaders. Tournaments were held where knights could exhibit their martial prowess. This provided venues where the crusading movement could recruit, spread propaganda and announce the recruitment of senior figures. However, even though crusading knights and some notable commanders demonstrated courage and commitment in military terms the campaigns in the Levant were not typically impressive. In feudal Europe, the formation of disciplined units was a significant challenge, strategic approaches and institutional frameworks were underdeveloped, and power was too fragmented to support cohesive organisation.

Literature presented the exemplar of an idealized, perfect knight in works such as Roman d&#x27;Alexandre written around 1130. These works celebrated adventure, courage, charity, and refined manners. However, the Church could not fully embrace all of these values they promoted. Its&#x27; spiritual views contrasted with ideas of excellence, achieved glory through military deeds and romantic love. While the church feared the warrior class, it still needed to co-opt its power and demonstrated this symbolically through the development of liturgical blessings to sanctify new knights. In time, kings represented themselves as members of the knighthood for propaganda purposes and crusading came to be seen as integral to the ideas of this ideal. From the time of the Fourth Crusade, crusading became an adventure normalized in Europe, thus creating a divide between the knights and other social classes and altering the relationship between knightly adventure, religious, and secular motivation.

In the polities created by the crusading movement in the Eastern Mediterranean known as the Crusader states the creation of military religious orders was one of the few innovations from outside Europe. In 1119 a small band of knights formed to protect pilgrims journeying to Jerusalem. These became the Knights Templar and many other orders followed this template. The Knights Hospitaller were already providing medical services to which was added a military wing leading to a much larger organisation. These orders became Latin Christendom&#x27;s first professional fighting forces and played a major part in the defence of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the other crusader states. Papal acknowledgement of the orders encouraged significant donations of money, land and recruits from across western Europe. The orders used this to build their own castles and to develop international autonomy. When the final Christian ruled territory in the Holy Land was lost following the Acre, the Hospitallers relocated to Cyprus. Later the order conquered and ruled Rhodes (1309–1522) and finally settled in Malta (1530–1798). King Philip IV of France dissolved the Templar order around 1312, likely driven by financial and political motives. He exerted pressure on Pope Clement V to disband the Templars. The resulting charges of sodomy, magic, and heresy cited in papal decrees such as and were probably unfounded.

=== Common people ===
From the Mid-20th Century historians took a greater interest than before questioning why significant numbers of the lower classes travelled on the early crusades or took part in the unsanctioned popular outbreaks of the 13th and 14th- centuries. The papacy wanted to recruit warriors who could fight, but in the early years of the movement it was impossible to exclude others, including women. Indeed, retinues included many to provide services who could also fight in emergencies. The church considered that engaging in crusade must be entirely voluntary. Recruitment propaganda used understandable mediums which could also be unclear. For the poor the institution of the crusade was offensive, while in church doctrines it was an act of self-defence.

From the 12thcentury onwards, the crusading movement generated propaganda material to spread the word. A good example was the work of a Dominican friar called Humbert of Romans. In 1268 he gathered the best crusading arguments in one work. The poor had different viewpoints to the theologians. Often based on an end of the world eschatological belief. When Acre was lost to the Egyptians there were resulting popular but brief outbursts of crusade fervour. However, the most Christians did not typically crusade to Jerusalem. Instead, they would often build models of the Holy Sepulchre or dedicate places of worship. These were acts that existed before the crusading movement, but they became increasingly popular in association. They may have formed part of other forms of regular religious devotion. In 1099 Jerusalem was known as &quot;the remotest place&quot;, but these practices made crusading tangible.

Unsanctioned popular crusading exploded in 1096, 1212, 1251, 1309, and 1320. These all exhibited violent antisemitism with the exception of the Children&#x27;s Crusade of 1212. Despite hostility from the literate these crusades became so mytho-historicised in the written histories that they are some of the most highly remembered events transmitted by word of mouth from the period. That said &quot;Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; is not a precise definition. The &quot;Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; of 1212 did not consist solely of children, despite its name. Contemporary and later chroniclers described the participants as pueri, which is Latin for &quot;youths&quot;. However, the term could refer to an unmarried boy, someone below the age of maturity and to denote someone of low social status, such as a shepherd, regardless of age. The many surviving written sources are of questionable accuracy. Dates and details are not consistent and they are interwoven with typical myth-history stories and ideas. Clerical writing contrasted the imagined innocence of the with the sexual licence that was seen on the official crusades. It was the sin of the crusaders that was believed to bring God&#x27;s displeasure and explain why the crusades were not successful.

=== Perception of Muslims ===

Literature such as the 11th-century &quot;Song of Roland&quot; did not explicitly mention the crusades. But is likely there were propaganda motivations behind presenting the Muslim characters in monstrous terms and as idolators. Whatever the motivation Christian writers continued to use these representations. Muslim characters were depicted as evil and dehumanized, with their physical traits described as devilish and their skin portrayed as dark. Islamic rituals were mocked, and insults were directed at Muhammad. This caricature persisted long after territorial conflicts had ended. The term &quot;Muslim&quot; was never used; instead, they were referred to as &quot;Saracens&quot; alongside other derogatory labels such as infidel, gentile, enemy of God, and pagan. This literature reinforced the Church&#x27;s portrayal of the Crusades as a Manichean struggle between good and evil. Historian Jean Flori suggests that the Church&#x27;s intent was to eliminate its rivals&#x27; ideology in order to justify Christianity&#x27;s participation in aggressive and violent conflicts. This prejudice was not derived from ethnic identity or race. The church considered that all of humanity were descended from Adam and Eve. Typical of medieval opinion this was a social construct in which the differentiators were cultural. For example, the First Crusade Chroniclers adopted terminology inherited from the Greeks of antiquity. They use the ethno-cultural term &#x27;barbarious nations&#x27; for the Muslims, and self-identified crusaders as Latins.

As contact increased respect for the Turks developed. presents some negativity but also respect for them as opponents. It was considered values of chivalry were shared. In the they were presented as equals following the same codes of conduct. By the time of the Third Crusade the class differences were shown as within camps rather the between camps. The elite warrior class in both camps shared an identity that was not divided on religious or political groups. Epics began to include incidents of conversion to Christianity. This in part may have offered hope for a positive resolution at a time when military failure pointed to defeat.

There remain a number of Crusade songs from the many crusaders who also wrote poetry such as Theobald I of Navarre, Folquet de Marselha, and Conon de Béthune. In return for patronage from the leaders of the crusades, poets wrote praising the ideals of the nobility. These relationships were of a feudal nature and were presented in this context. To demonstrate this, the crusaders were God&#x27;s vassals fighting the restore to him the (Holy) land. Muslims were presented as having stolen this land. Their mistreatment of its Christian inhabitants was considered an injustice for which revenge was required. In return, the perception of the Islamic polities resulted in an opposing position. This encouraged violent resistance to the idea of the imposition Christian governance on these terms.

The origins of the crusading movement lie within the nature of Western Christian society in the late eleventh century rather than any external provocation, despite intense propaganda about the Turks&#x27; actions. While the Seljuk Turks&#x27; incursions into Anatolia increased after the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Islam had controlled Jerusalem since 638 without eliciting a comparable Western reaction. Urban II&#x27;s appeal at Clermont in 1095 resonated strongly because it aligned with attitudes already prevalent in Western Christian experience.

== History ==
 In the late 11th and early 12thcenturies, the papacy became an entity capable of organized violence in the same manner as secular kingdoms and principalities. At this point, the necessary command and control systems for military action were not fully developed or efficient. So, the papacy needed to use secular fighting forces for its own ends.. This development derived from changes enacted by reformists within the Church during the papacy of Pope Alexander II. The Church became involved in, and gave approval for, conflict with Muslims in the Mediterranean region, including the Norman conquest of Sicily, the capture of territory from Muslim Spain and the Mahdia campaign of 1087 where it allied with the republics of Pisa and Genoa. In 1095, Urban II laid the foundations of the Crusading movement at the Council of Clermont. He was responding to requests for military support from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos that had first been received during the earlier Council of Piacenza. Alexios was fighting Turkish people who were migrating into Anatolia, threatened Constantinople and had formed the Seljuk Empire. Urban expressed two key objectives for the Crusade: Firstly, the freeing of Christians from Muslim rule; Secondly, freeing the church known as the Holy Sepulchre from Muslim control. This church was believed by the Church to mark the location of Chris&#x27;s tomb in Jerusalem.
=== 12th century ===
In the 12th century, Gratian and the Decretists included key elements of traditional opinions about war and soldiers in Decretum, drawing upon the writings of St. Augustine. Gratian addressed questions such as whether bearing arms was lawful to defend the faithful and whether the possessions of heretics could be seized in self-defence. According to Frederick Russell in &quot;The Just War in the Middle Ages&quot;, Augustine “cast the die” for the medieval just war, influencing opinion throughout the Middle Ages including Aquinas&#x27; work in the 13thcentury. The reformers philosophy was to end secular control of the Latin church, impose control over the Eastern Orthodox Church and to work in the secular world for the imposition of what the church considered justice. 

After the initial success of the early Crusades the settlers who remained or later migrated were militarily vulnerable. During the 12th and 13th centuries, frequent supportive expeditions were required to maintain territory that had been gained. A cycle developed of military failure, pleas for support and declarations of Crusades from the church. The success of the First Crusade that began the Crusading movement and the century was seen as astonishing. The explanation for this was given that it was only possible through the will of God. Paschal II, who reigned as pope from 1099-1118, showed special interest in crusading, especially in Spain. Paschal II offered remission of sins to encourage Spaniards to fight Muslims at home rather than in the Jerusalem war. Paschal II also offered plenary remission for conflicts against his political opponents and, under the guise of a new crusade to Palestine, to Bohemund’s campaign against Byzantium.

It was in certain social and feudal networks that early Crusade recruitment concentrated. Not only did these groups provide manpower, but also funding. Although it may have been pragmatic acceptance of the pressure of the reform movement that prompted the sales of churches and tithes. These families often had a history of pilgrimage, along with connections to Cluniac monasticism and the reformed papacy. They honoured the same saints. With inter-marriage this cultural mores were spread through society. Paschal&#x27;s successor Pope Calixtus II shared his Spanish interests. In 1123, at the First Council of the Lateran it was decided that crusading would be deployed in both Iberia and the Levant. The outcome was a campaign by Alfonso the Battler against Granada in 1125. Eugenius III, who reigned as pope from 1145 to 1153, played a crucial role in the crusading movement, particularly by issuing the bull Quantum praedecessores in 1145, which called for what became the Second Crusade. This bull, framed by the memory of the First Crusade, offered remission of sins and temporal privileges to crusaders, thus consolidating papal influence and authority. Although initially the response was muted, the involvement of Bernard of Clairvaux and the Cistercian order gained momentum for the effort, which ultimately shaped the ideology and practice of crusading.

The Renaissance of the 12th century coincided with the early years of crusading. Crusading themes were the subject of developing vernacular literature in the languages of Western Europe. Examples of Epic poetry include the describing the events in the 1268 siege of Antioch and about the crusading against the Cathars in Southern France. These are given the collective name of in the French language which is borrowed from Latin for the term deeds done. Surviving songs about Crusading are rarer. But there are examples in the literary language of southern France, Occitan, French, German, Spanish, and Italian that touch on the topic in an allegorical that date from the later half of the century. Two notable Occitan troubadours were Marcabru and Cercamon. They composed songs in the styles called and on the subject of lost love. Crusading wasn&#x27;t a distinct genre, but the subject. The troubadours had northern French equivalents called and German ones called . Collectively they left bodies of works themed on the crusades later in the century. This material transmitted information about crusading unmediated by the church. It is reinforced the status quo, the class identity of the nobility and its position in society. When the outcomes of events was less positive this was also a method of spreading criticisms of organization and behaviour.

In the latter part of the century Europeans developed language, fashion and cultural mores for crusading. Terms were adopted for those involved such as or . These indicated that they were marked by the cross. This was reinforced by cloth crosses that they attached to their clothes. All of this was taken from the Bible. Luke 9:23, Mark 8:34 and Matthew 16:24 all implored believers to pick up their cross and follow Christ. It was a personal relationship with God that these crusaders were attempting to form. It demonstrated their belief. It enabled anyone to become involved, irrespective of gender, wealth, or social standing. This was , an &quot;imitation of Christ&quot;, a sacrifice motivated by charity for fellow Christians. It began to be considered that all those who died campaigning were martyrs.

=== 13th century ===

 At the turn of the century eschatology, the belief that everything that happened was predestined, either by God or fate, and apocalypticism greatly influenced the crusading movement. The medieval prophet Joachim of Fiore married the fight with infidels to his view of world history. Apocalypticism and the expectation of an imminent Second Coming, provided apocalyptic themes because the goal of Christian control of Jerusalem highlighted its eschatological role within religious thinking. Eschatology was more important in later crusades, particularly those launched after the loss of Jerusalem in 1187. . The response to which led to a focus on the image of the cross and the act of crusading was extrapolated into a general religious revival. As news spread of the serious threat to the faith preachers&#x27; rhetoric emphasised the sanctity of Apostolic poverty, while demonstrations and marches in northern France and the Rhineland broke out that later became known as the Children’s Crusade. .

Creating a single accepted ideology and understanding of that ideology was a practical challenge for the crusading movement. The church did not have bureaucratic systems that could consolidate thinking across the papacy, the monastic orders, mendicant friars, and the developing universities. Ideas were transmitted through inclusion in literary works that included romances, travelogues like &quot;Mandeville&#x27;s Travels&quot;, poems such as Piers Plowman and John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;, and works by Geoffrey Chaucer. At this point in time the ideas of nationalism were largely absent. A more atomized society meant that literature tended to rather praise individual deeds of heroes like Charlemagne and the actions of major families. Innocent III developed new practices and revised the ideology of crusading from 1198 when he became pope. This included a new executive office constituted for the organization of the Fourth Crusade. Executives were appointed in each church province in addition to autonomous preaching by the like of Fulk of Neuilly. This led to papal sanctioned provincial administrations and the codification of preaching. Local church authorities were required to report to these administrators on crusading policy. Propaganda was now more coherent despite an occasionally ad-hoc implementation. Funding was increased through the introduction of hypothecated tax and greater donations. He was also the first pope to deploy the apparatus of crusading against his fellow Christians. This innovation became a frequent approach by the papacy that was used against those it considered dissenters, heretics, or schismatics.

The Children&#x27;s Crusade was the first of a number of similar events which lasted until the Hungarian Peasants&#x27; Crusade in 1514. What these all had in common was that they were independent of the church. The first seems to have been a response to the preaching of the Albigensian Crusade and also religious processions seeking God&#x27;s support for the fighting in Iberia. The church considered such outbreaks by rather unconventional crusaders as unauthorized and therefore illegitimate. There is little remaining evidence for the identities, thoughts and feelings of those who took part. One unaccredited piece is the Austrian Rhymed Chronicle. This includes allegedly verbatim lyrics of the marching song of children heading east and offers evidence of eschatological beliefs. The church was unable to comprehend the charisma of impoverished non-priestly leaders like Nicholas of Cologne and how this could be used in recruiting such large followings. Modern academic opinion is split on the definition of a crusade. Riley-Smith disregards these popular uprisings as not meeting the criteria, while Gary Dickson has produced in depth research. His research challenges traditional interpretations of the crusades by focusing on the social and religious dimensions of popular participation. In this he demonstrates that the term pueri referred to youths or individuals of low social status, and that this movement was not solely composed of children but included marginalized groups like shepherds and agricultural workers. Dickson&#x27;s work interprets the &quot;Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; as a form of social critique driven by a desire to return to apostolic simplicity and dissatisfaction with societal leaders. Additionally, his examination of the early 19th-century historiography of the crusades highlights a tendency to view them through a lens of materialism and romanticism. His research also emphasizes the importance of including popular crusades and unsanctioned outbreaks in the broader study of the crusading movement, arguing that rigid definitions can obscure the complexity and variety of the phenomenon. He notes that historians have &quot;reinvented&quot; or reinterpreted the crusades throughout history.

Occitan Troubadours expressed discontent with expeditions in their southern French homeland. Reports of behaviour such as sexual immorality, greed, and arrogance by those on crusade were viewed as incompatible with the ideals of a holy war. Commentators used this to excuse or explain failure and setback in what was otherwise considered God&#x27;s work. Some, such as Gerhoh of Reichersberg, linked defeats to the expected coming of the Antichrist. The Church responded to criticism with puritanism, processions and reforms, such as gambling bans and restrictions on women. Critical primary sources include the &quot;Würzburg Annals&quot; and Humbert of Romans&#x27;s work &quot;De praedicatione crucis&quot; which translates as &quot;concerning the preaching of the cross&quot;. Some crusaders were thought to have fallen under satanic influence and doubts were raised about forcible conversion.

The crusading movement experienced both sympathy and criticism. The wide extension of crusading coincided with the greatest effectiveness of papal power, as the crusade put at the disposal of the Roman Church privileges which it could employ to promote military action against its enemies. However, widespread disillusionment with crusading arose because of persistent failure, the increasing weight of taxation required to support expeditions, and resentment against the political misuse of the movement. The defeat of Louis IX of France at the Battle of Mansurah in 1250 was decisive, leading to grief and accusations against God, even causing the faith of many to waver. Despite the spiritual value of crusading recognized by the church, some regarded the institution as deeply flawed. 

The movement continued developing innovative organisational financial methods. However, in 1274 it was at a significant low. In response the Second Council of Lyons initiated the search for new ideas. The response to which showed a resilience that would enable the continuation of the movement. This was not without opposition. Matthew Paris in &quot; and Richard of Mapham, the dean of Lincoln both raised noteworthy concerns and the Teutonic Order for one, among others of the military orders were criticized for arrogance, greed, using their great wealth to pay for luxurious lifestyles, and an inadequate response in the Holy Land. Collaboration was difficult because of open conflict between the Templars and Hospitallers and among Christians in the Baltic. The autonomy of the orders was viewed in the church as leading to a loss of effectiveness in the East and overly friendlt relations with Muslims. A minority within the church including Roger Bacon made the case that aggression in areas like the Baltic actually hindered conversion. Pope Gregory X developed the objective of reunification with the Greek church as an essential prerequisite for further crusades. In planning the funding of this crusade he created a complex tax gathering regime by Latin Christendom into twenty-six collectorates, each directed by a general collector. In order to tackle fraud each collector would further delegate tax liability assessment. This system raised vast amounts which in turn prompted further clerical criticism of obligatory taxation.

=== 14th century ===

The 14thcentury saw further outbreaks of popular and unsanctioned crusading enthusiasm. These were often prompted by major events such as the Mongol victory at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar. At the grassroots movements in France and Germany continued. The Teutonic Order recruited crusaders in Prussia and Livonia. This was without authorization from the church, but the order utilized privileges granted half a century earlier by Innocent IV. The campaigns known as journeys or were popular and attracted knights from across the Catholic states of Europe. In this way they became a chivalric cult. Following the tradition started by Innocent III, popes requested advice on strategies that could be implemented in the recovery of the Holy Land. Over twenty example papers remain from the period that is book-ended by the 1274 council of Lyon and the 1314 council of Vienna. The movement continued Institutionalisation with developments for the intended funding of professional armies, including a six-year tithe on clerical incomes. However, the politics of the Capetian dynasty and House of Barcelona prevented progress. Egypt was not blockaded and no new foothold was established in the East.

In 1132 a new approach and crusading institution was devised. This was a Holy League, the first of several temporary alliances between the church and other Christian polities. In 1344, the Smyrniote crusades successfully captured Smyrni. The precedent was later followed successfully in the 1571 Battle of Lepanto and in the late 17thcentury for the recovery of territory in the Balkans. Italy experienced a state of political anarchy. As a result, the church granted crusade indulgences to anyone who could be recruited to fight against the threat presented by merceneries and for the popes and the papacy that was now based in Avignon. From 1378 until 1417 the papacy was divided in what is known as the Western Schism between the Roman Pope Urban VI against his Avignon rival Clement VII. Both Roman and Avignon popes authorized crusades during succession wars in Naples. Urban VI associated the crusade with Bishop Henry le Despenser of Norwich’s campaign in Flanders in 1383. Inadequate church taxation restricted the ability to underwrite substantial campaigns, and papal claims underpinning crusade theory were traduced, even if crusading against heretics, pagans, Egypt, and Ottomans retained support. Eventually the movement and the papacy united in the face of the growing threat of the Ottoman Turks. By the end of the century, the was obsolete and the only contact that common people had with the movement was the preaching of the indulgence. While the success or failure of propaganda varied in extent, local attitude and capability, there is no evidence that it was popular apathy or hostility that caused of the mobilization failure of large scale crusading against the Turks.

=== 15th and 16th centuries ===

Following Eugenius IV&#x27;s elevation to the papacy in 1431 the church engaged in ecumenical negotiation with the Byzantine Empire. The discussions with John V Palaiologos resulted in agreement to unify the Latin, Greek Orthodox, Armenian, Nestorian, and Cypriot Maronite churches and commitments of military support for the Byzantines. Eugenius coordinated this support in defence of Constantinople from 1440 and 1444. Despite this the Turks were decisively victorious at the Battle of Varna in November 1444, captured the city in 1453 and expanded territorially over a 28-year period.

The movement continued levying of church taxes and preaching of indulgences. As it did the commissioning of advisory tracts reconsidering the political, financial, and military issues with luminaries like as Cardinal Bessarion dedicating their lives to the cause. Frankish exiles from the East toured Christendom&#x27;s courts seeking assistance. Pius II attempted to persuade Mehmed II to converts and failed in attempts to raise a crusade in 1464. In this period the funding and military capability was inadequate, timed badly or just misdirected. One contributing factor was that warfare was now both increasingly professional and costly. The nature of crusading changed, with a notable increase in contractual recruitment, the need for intelligence and espionage, the importance of naval warfare, the grooming of alliances, the development of innovative tactics, and the expense of expertise in siege warfare. The difficulties of the movement caused disillusionment and doubts that the objectives of the movements were practical. The political authority of the papacy was eroded by the Western Schism to such an extent that congresses ignored. Increasingly independent secular rulers prioritized their own ambitions. No doubt was evident that Europe needed a crusade to resist the Ottoman threat, but self interest became an unavoidable barrier to this. In this situation it is difficult to find evidence of popular sentiment, particularly as actual crusading had long become divorced from most commoners&#x27; lives. In one case from 1488 Wageningen parishioners were influenced by their priest&#x27;s criticism of crusading to such an extent that they prevented collectors taking away donations. Contrasting accounts record successful preaching in Erfurt and an extraordinary response for a crusade to relieve Belgrade in 1456.

During the late 15th and early 16thcenturies, the military orders were transformed. Castile nationalized theirs between 1487 and 1499. In 1523, the Hospitallers retreated from Rhodes to Crete and Sicily and in 1530 to Malta and Gozo. The State of the Teutonic Order became the hereditary Duchy of Prussia when the last Prussian master, Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach, converted to Lutheranism and became the first duke under oath to his uncle Sigismund I the Old of Poland. Rivalry between Catholic monarchs prevented anti-Protestant crusades, but individual some military actions were still rewarded with crusader privileges. These include Irish Catholic rebellions against English Protestant rule and the Spanish Armada&#x27;s attack on Elizabeth I of England. In 1562, Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany became the hereditary Grand Master of the Order of Saint Stephen. This was a Tuscan military order he founded that was modelled on the knights of Malta. The Hospitallers remained the only independent military order with a positive strategy. Other orders continued as aristocratic corporations while lay powers absorbed local orders, outposts, and priories.

=== 17th century and later ===

In the 17thcentury, crusading activity was mainly related to the Hapsburgs and issues associated with Spanish national identity. That said the Cretan War (1645–1669), the Battle of Vienna, and the Holy League (1684) were all supported with crusade indulgences and taxation. By the 18thcentury the crusading movement ended practical terms, although the Hospitallers continued. Other orders were largely irrelevant outside the Hapsburg Empire and following the French Revolution there were widespread confiscations. In 1798 Napoleon ended the Hospitallers military ability by capturing their Maltese base. In 1809, he suppressed the Order of St Stephen, and the Teutonic Order&#x27;s identity as a military order ended when it lost its German possessions and relocated to Vienna. In 1936, the Spanish Catholic church supported Francisco Franco&#x27;s coup by declaring a crusade against Marxism and atheism. Thirty-six years of National Catholicism followed. In this period the idea developed of Reconquista as a foundational historical memory. It became celebrated as part of Spanish national identity and was entrenched in conservative circles. When Spain restored democracy in 1978, Reconquista lost this historiographical hegemony. However, because of its strong ideological connotations it remains fundamental to understanding of the medieval period within conservative circles.

== Legacy ==
The crusading movement left an enduring legacy. It was a significant influence on western culture in the late medieval period and left an historical impact on the Islamic world. The impact touched nearly every aspect of European life. Historians have debated whether the Latin States created by the movement in the Eastern Mediterranean were the first examples of European colonialism. The &quot;Outremer&quot; is the name that is often used for these states. This translates as a &quot;Europe Overseas&quot;. In mid-19thcentury historiography this became a focus for European nationalism and associated with European colonialism. This is a view that was contested. The Latin settlements did not align neatly with the typical definition a colony. They were neither directly controlled or exploited by a homeland. A different definition, of a religious colony, describes a territory conquered and settled with religious motivation. This territory maintains close contact with its homeland, share the same religious views and requires support in both military and financial terms. The polities of Venetian Greece offer a better match to the traditional model of colonialism. These were carved out of the Byzantine Empire as a result of the crusading movement and the Fourth Crusade The republic of Venice had a political and economic stake in these territories to such a degree that the region attracted settlers that would otherwise migrated to the Latin East. In this way its success actually weakened the crusader states.

The crusading movement created a flourishing system of trade in the Mediterranean. New routes were created to serve the Outremer with Genoa and Venice planting profitable trading outposts across the region.
 Many historians argue that the increasingly frequent contact between the Latin Christian and Islamic cultures was a positive. It was foundational in the progress of European civilization and the Renaissance. Closer contact with the Muslim and Byzantine worlds enabled access for western European scholars to classical Greek and Roman texts. This led to the rediscovery by pre-Christian philosophy, science, and medicine. It is difficult to identify exactly the source of cultural interchange. The increase of knowledge of Islamic culture was the result of contact that stretched the breadth of the Mediterranean Sea.

The movement allowed the papacy to strengthen its leadership within the Latin Church. The clergy became inured to violence, while the church developed closer links with feudalism and military capability. The Medieval Inquisition, Dominican and military orders as were all institutionalized. A catalyst for the Reformation was the growing opposition to developments in the use of indulgences. Relations between western Christians, the Greeks and the Muslims were also soured by the behaviour of the crusaders. These differences became an enduring barrier between the Latin, the Orthodox and Islamic worlds. The crusading movement had a reputation of a defeated aggressor and unification of the Christian churches became problematic. Political Islam makes historical parallels, provoking paradigms of jihad and struggle. Arab nationalism looks on the movement as an example of Western imperialism. Thinkers, politicians, and historians in the Islamic world draw an equivalence with more recent events like the League of Nations mandates to govern Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. An opposing analogy has developed in Western world right-wing circles. Here, Christianity is considered to be under a similar existential Islamic religious and demographic threat. The result is anti-Islamic rhetoric and symbols. This provides an argument for a contest with a religious foe. Thomas F. Madden argues that these modern tensions are the result of constructed view developed during the 19thcentury by the colonial powers. This in turn led to the rise of Arab nationalism. For Madden, the crusading movement is a defensive and solely medieval phenomenon.

== Historiography ==
Almost immediately, the First Crusade provoked literary examination. Initially this served as propaganda for the crusading movement and was based on a few separate but related works. One of these, (literally &#x27;the deeds of the Franks&#x27;). It created a template for later works based on papal, northern French, and Benedictine ideas. It considered military success or failure entirely to God&#x27;s will in its promotion of violent action.

Albert of Aachen produced contrasting vernacular stories of adventure. At this point the early chroniclers concentrated on the moral lessons that could be taken from the crusades. This reinforced normative moral and cultural positions. Academic crusade historian Paul Chevedden argued that the early accounts were already an anachronism. The writers were writing with the knowledge of the unexpected success of the First Crusade. For Chevedden, more can be learned about how the crusading movement was viewed in the 11thcentury in the works of Urban II who died ignorant of the crusade&#x27;s success. Albert&#x27;s adventure stories were developed and extended in turn by William of Tyre before the end of the 12thcentury. William documented the early history of the military Crusader States. In this he illustrated the tension between secular and motivation.

In the 16thcentury the Reformation and the Ottoman expansion shaped opinion. Protestant martyrologist John Foxe writing in his 1566 work &quot;History of the Turks&quot; blamed the sins of the Catholic Church for the failure of the crusades. He also criticized the use of crusading against those he considered had maintained the faith, such as the Albigensians and Waldensians. The Lutheran scholar Matthew Dresser (1536–1607) went further. He praised for their faith, but considered that Urban II was motivated by his conflict with Emperor Henry IV. Dresser considered that the flaw in the crusading movement was that the idea of restoring the physical holy places was &quot;detestable superstition&quot;. One of the first to number the crusades was the French Catholic lawyer Étienne Pasquier. His suggestion was that there were six. In his work he highlighted the failures. In addition he raised the damage that religious conflict had inflicted on France and the church. The key points were the victims of papal aggression, the sale of indulgences, abuses in the church, corruption, and conflicts at home.

Age of Enlightenment philosophers and historians such as David Hume, Voltaire and Edward Gibbon used crusading as a conceptual tool to critique religion, civilization and cultural mores. For them the positives effects of crusading, such as the increasing liberty that municipalities were able to purchase from feudal lords, were only by-products. This view was then criticized in the 19thcentury by Crusade enthusiasts as being unnecessarily hostile to, and ignorant of, the crusades. Alternatively, Claude Fleury and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz proposed that the crusades were one stage in the improvement of European civilization; that paradigm was further developed by the Rationalists.

The idea that the crusades were an important part of national history and identity continued to evolve. In scholarly literature, the term &quot;holy war&quot; was replaced by the neutral German and French . Gibbon followed Thomas Fuller in dismissing the concept that the crusades were a legitimate defence, as they were disproportionate to the threat presented; Palestine was an objective, not because of reason but because of fanaticism and superstition. William Robertson expanded on Fleury in a new, empirical, objective approach, placing crusading in a narrative of progress towards modernity. The cultural consequences of growth in trade, the rise of the Italian cities and progress are elaborated in his work. In this he influenced his student Walter Scott. Much of the popular understanding of the Crusades derives from the 19th-century novels of Scott and the French histories by Joseph François Michaud. Michaud&#x27;s viewpoint provoked Muslim attitudes. Previously, the crusading movement had aroused little interest among Islamic and Arabic scholars. This changed with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the penetration of European power into the Eastern Mediterrarean.

In the 2001 article &quot;The Historiography of the Crusades&quot;, Giles Constable attempted to categorize what is meant by &quot;Crusade&quot; into four areas of contemporary crusade study. His view was that &quot;Traditionalists&quot; such as Hans Eberhard Mayer are concerned with where the Crusades were aimed, &quot;Pluralists&quot; such as Jonathan Riley-Smith concentrate on how the Crusades were organized, &quot;Popularists&quot; including Paul Alphandery and Etienne Delaruelle focus on the popular groundswells of religious fervour, and &quot;Generalists&quot;, such as Ernst-Dieter Hehl focus on the phenomenon of Latin holy wars. The historian Thomas F. Madden argues that modern tensions are the result of a constructed view of the Crusades created by colonial powers in the 19thcentury and transmitted into Arab nationalism. For him the Crusades are a medieval phenomenon in which the crusaders were engaged in a defensive war on behalf of their co-religionists.

The Byzantines harboured a negative perspective on holy warfare, failing to grasp the concept of the Crusades and finding them repugnant. Although some initially embraced Westerners due to a common Christianity, their trust soon waned. With a pragmatic approach, the Byzantines prioritized strategic locations such as Antioch over sentimental objectives like Jerusalem. They couldn&#x27;t comprehend the merging of pilgrimage and warfare. The advocacy for infidel eradication by St. Bernard and the militant role of the Templars would deeply shock them. Suspicions arose among the Byzantines that Westerners aimed for imperial conquest, leading to growing animosity. Despite occasionally using the term &quot;holy war&quot; in historical contexts, Byzantine conflicts were not inherently holy but perceived as just, defending the empire and Christian faith. War, to the Byzantines, was justified solely for the defence of the empire, in contrast to Muslim expansionist ideals and Western knights&#x27; notion of holy warfare to glorify Christianity.

Scholars like Carole Hillenbrand assert that within the broader context of Muslim historical events, the Crusades were considered a marginal issue when compared to the collapse of the Caliphate, the Mongol invasions, and the rise of the Turkish Ottoman Empire, supplanting Arab rule. Arab historians, influenced by historical opposition to Turkish control over their homelands, adopted a Western perspective on the Crusades. Syrian Christians proficient in Arabic played a vital role by translating French histories into Arabic. The first modern biography of Saladin was authored by the Ottoman Turk Namık Kemal in 1872, while the Egyptian Sayyid Ali al-Hariri produced the initial Arabic history of the Crusades in response to Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s visit to Jerusalem in 1898. The visit triggered a renewed interest in Saladin, who had previously been overshadowed by more recent leaders like Baybars. The reinterpretation of Saladin as a hero against Western imperialism gained traction among nationalist Arabs, fuelled by anti-imperialist sentiment. The intersection of history and contemporary politics is evident in the development of ideas surrounding jihad and Arab nationalism. Historical parallels between the Crusades and modern political events, such as the establishment of Israel in 1948, have been drawn. In contemporary Western discourse, right-wing perspectives have emerged, viewing Christianity as under threat analogous to the Crusades, using crusader symbols and anti-Islamic rhetoric for propaganda purposes. Madden argues that Arab nationalism absorbed a constructed view of the Crusades created by colonial powers in the 19th century, contributing to modern tensions. Madden suggests that the crusading movement, from a medieval perspective, engaged in a defensive war on behalf of co-religionists.

<text>A figure painting is a work of fine art in any of the painting media with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or nude. Figure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human figure has been one of the constant subjects of art since the first Stone Age cave paintings, and has been reinterpreted in various styles throughout history.

Unlike figure drawings which are usually nudes, figure paintings are often clothed depictions which may be either historically accurate or symbolic. 
Figure painting is not synonymous with figurative art, which may depict real objects of any kind (including humans and animals).

== Clothed figures ==
=== Portraiture ===
A portrait painting focuses on the creation of a likeness of a particular individual or group.

=== Everyday life ===
Genre painting portray ordinary people engaged in common activities.

=== Narrative paintings ===
Historical paintings depict events in a narrative, which may be allegorical.

== Nude figures ==
The nude has been a theme in Western art since classical antiquity and again in Renaissance art, after being largely absent during the Middle Ages.

While standing nude figures of both sexes are found in antiquity, in Western art, male nudes were more prevalent through the idealisation of the male form in society. The first female reclining nudes as a popular genre appeared during the Renaissance, most notably in a work by Giorgione. Oil paint historically has been the ideal media for depicting the figure. By blending and layering paint, the surface can become more like skin. &quot;Its slow drying time and various degrees of viscosity enable the artist to achieve rich and subtle blends of color and texture, which can suggest transformations from one human substance to another.&quot; Although working from live models is preferred, the length of time needed to complete a painting has led most modern painters to use photographs as references at least part of the time if not for the entire work.

<doc id="405305" wikidata="Q17143808" url="?curid=405305" title="Training stamp">
<text>A training stamp is a label resembling a postage stamp that is used by postal authorities to train postal workers. They generally have the same size and shape as regular stamps, but with a minimal design. Alternatively, several countries have simply obliterated their regular stamps in order to make the training process more realistic, for instance Sudan and the United Kingdom.

In some cases, training stamps may be interchangeable with test stamps though test stamps do not need to have a range of values to assist with training postal workers. Although training stamps are not normally available to the general public, some have found their way into private hands, and they are a recognised stamp collecting speciality. Training stamps are a form of cinderella stamp.

== France ==
Training stamps have been widely used in France and one series consists of a number of plain labels of minimal design with different numbers and the words &quot;sans valeur&quot; (without value).

==Sudan==

A number of Sudanese stamps have been overprinted &quot;school&quot; for use at the post office training school.

== United Kingdom ==
Stamps used for training postal workers in the United Kingdom are usually normal postage or other stamps, including television license and national insurance stamps (when they were in use), obliterated with two vertical or horizontal bars to prevent genuine use, though other forms of cancellation have been used such as overprinting or rubber stamps. They have frequently found their way into the hands of collectors. Early examples were properly printed with bars but more recent examples tend to simply be crossed through with a black marker pen. A range of cancelled or voided paper money, cheques, postal orders, credit cards and horizon labels are also used to train workers which takes place at counter training schools (CTOs). Before decimalisation in 1971, post offices were issued with very simple training stamps in the same colours as the upcoming decimal stamps.

==United States==
Around the early twentieth century, some U.S. business colleges used specially pre-cancelled stamps or stamp-like labels to train students in the handling of stamps.

<doc id="405308" wikidata="Q7867398" url="?curid=405308" title="USS Argonaut (SS-475)">
<text>USS &quot;Argonaut&quot; (SS-475) was a operated by the United States Navy (USN). Constructed at Portsmouth Navy Yard during the second half of 1944, &quot;Argonaut&quot; was commissioned into the USN in 1945 and operated against Japan during the final year of World War II, although her only contact with the Japanese was when she sank a junk in August. During the 1950s, the submarine was modified for greater underwater endurance, and to guide the Regulus I missile. From 1963 to 1965, &quot;Argonaut&quot; operated in the Mediterranean Sea.

The submarine was sold to Canada in 1968, commissioned into Maritime Command as HMCS &quot;Rainbow&quot; (SS 75), and operated until the end of 1974. The submarine was returned to the United States, and scrapped in 1977.

==US service==
&quot;Argonaut&quot; was laid down at Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine on 28 June 1944. She was launched on 1 October 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Allan R. McCann and commissioned on 15 January 1945, Lieutenant Commander John S. Schmidt in command.

&quot;Argonaut&quot; held shakedown in the Portsmouth area and in Narragansett Bay and returned briefly to Portsmouth on 27 March for post-shakedown availability. She then sailed on 14 April for Key West, Florida, where she conducted special tests for lighter-than-air craft and training operations with the Fleet Sound School. &quot;Argonaut&quot; departed the Florida coast on 13 May to transit the Panama Canal en route Hawaii. Reaching Pearl Harbor on 11 June, the submarine spent two weeks in repairs and training exercises before beginning her first war patrol on 28 June.

She made a fuel stop at Saipan on 10 July and then proceeded to the Formosa Strait and the East China and Yellow Seas to search for enemy shipping. On 16 July, &quot;Argonaut&quot; spotted a downed aviator, picked him up, and later transferred him to . Her only contact with Japanese vessels during the patrol came on 12 August, when &quot;Argonaut&quot; sank a 25-ton junk with fire from her 40 mm and 20 mm guns, her only combat action. She terminated her patrol at Guam on 21 August, six days after Japan capitulated, ending World War II.

===Post-war===
&quot;Argonaut&quot; departed Guam on 1 September and proceeded, via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal, to the Naval Frontier Base at Tompkinsville, New York. She arrived in New York on 4 October but continued on to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. Early in 1946, &quot;Argonaut&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and was based at Panama. While en route to Panama, &quot;Argonaut&quot; collided with light cruiser off the United States East Coast between New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during a heavy fog. &quot;Honolulu&quot; sustained minor damage but &quot;Argonaut&quot; sustained major damage; with of the bow bent completely around and facing aft. The submarine was in for major repairs for many months at New London, Connecticut. Later in 1946, &quot;Argonaut&quot; became a unit of Submarine Squadron 2 (SubRon 2) based at New London, Connecticut.

In July 1952, &quot;Argonaut&quot; underwent a major conversion as part of the Fleet Snorkel program at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, during which she received a snorkel system and a streamlined sail. These changes gave the submarine greater submerged speed and range. &quot;Argonaut&quot; was one of the few Fleet Snorkel submarines to retain her 5-inch deck gun, until it was removed by 1957.

&quot;Argonaut&quot; operated from New London until July 1955, when she was reassigned to SubRon 6 at Norfolk, Virginia. Following this move, &quot;Argonaut&quot; was converted to a guided missile submarine armed with a Regulus I missile.

In 1958, &quot;Argonaut&quot;″s home port was changed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she remained for a year, engaged primarily in missile operations as guidance submarine for Regulus missiles. The submarine returned to Norfolk, Virginia in 1959. During an overhaul in early 1960, &quot;Argonaut&quot;″s missile equipment was removed. When the alterations were completed, the submarine resumed her routine of supporting antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training operations out of Norfolk.

On 15 October 1962, &quot;Argonaut&quot; performed duties in conjunction with the naval quarantine of Cuba. She then had a routine overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. The yard work was completed on 13 May 1963, and the submarine sailed to the New London area for refresher training. After further training in the Virginia Capes area, she got underway on 19 August for the Mediterranean and service with the 6th Fleet. Her ports of call during the deployment included Gibraltar; Suda Bay, Crete; Rhodes, Greece; İzmir, Turkey; Toulon and Marseille, France; Sanremo and Naples, Italy. The submarine returned to home port on 15 December.

&quot;Argonaut&quot; continued her routine of operations along the U.S. east coast with periodic deployments to the Mediterranean. On 1 December 1965 &quot;Argonaut&quot; commenced overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. &quot;Argonaut&quot; left the shipyard on 10 June 1966 for sea trials, and on 20 January headed for New London for refresher training. She then provided services to the submarine school at New London through the remainder of 1966.

The submarine moved to Norfolk early in 1967, but left the Virginia Capes area on 9 January, bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico. &quot;Argonaut&quot; took part in Operation &quot;Springboard&quot; through the rest of January and most of February before leaving the Caribbean on 23 February to return to Norfolk, arriving there five days later. For the next two months, &quot;Argonaut&quot; prepared for a North Atlantic and Mediterranean cruise. She sailed on 26 May and made her first port call at Trondheim, Norway. The submarine also visited Cuxhaven, Germany; Leith, Scotland; Rota, Spain; Naples, Italy; and Valletta, Malta, before returning to her home port on 20 September. She remained in the local operating area through the duration of the year.

The submarine traveled to New London on 6 February 1968 and was in drydock there from 9 to 26 February, returning to Norfolk on 27 February. She made a patrol in the Jacksonville, Florida operating area in mid-March and put in at Port Everglades, Florida on 22 March. Three days later the submarine got underway for her home port. Upon her arrival in Norfolk on 29 March, she assumed a schedule of local operations. This was interrupted by another cruise to Port Everglades in October. She returned that month to Norfolk and began preparations for deactivation. &quot;Argonaut&quot; was decommissioned on 2 December, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register that same day.

==Canadian service==
In 1968 &quot;Argonaut&quot; was put up for sale by the United States. Offered to the Royal Canadian Navy, the US Navy gave Maritime Command five weeks to decide if they wanted the submarine. &quot;Argonaut&quot; was similar to the submarine already on loan from the United States, but significantly upgraded. The purchase was approved after Maritime Command said that &quot;Grilse&quot; was no longer fit for service and Canada needed a replacement for training purposes.

Canada purchased the hull outright for $153,000 and modernized the submarine at Esquimalt, British Columbia for $2.5 million. In November 1968 the submarine was prepared for departure from Norfolk, Virginia. &quot;Argonaut&quot; was in poor condition however, with only one of her four diesel engines in working condition, her electrical generator unusable and the boat was leaking.

The boat was commissioned on 2 December 1968 as HMCS &quot;Rainbow&quot; (SS 75) and sailed for Esquimalt with only two engines working. The submarine caught fire twice while &quot;en route&quot; to British Columbia, and upon arrival was refused entry into port due to unpaid taxes and customs duty on her purchase. Once the government had paid the $12,000 owing, &quot;Rainbow&quot; entered Esquimalt and began her refit. The modernization took eight months, after which &quot;Rainbow&quot; took up &quot;Grilse&quot;&#x27;s anti-submarine warfare training on the West Coast.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; was decommissioned on 31 December 1974 due to budget cuts and her need for a refit. Maritime Command kept the submarine in reserve, laid up until 1976, hoping to return her to service. However, in 1976, the boat was returned to the United States and scrapped at Portland, Oregon in 1977 for $213,687.

==Legacy==

There is a detailed 1/100 scale model of &quot;Argonaut&quot; in the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut.

<text>USS &quot;Argonaut&quot; (V-4/SF-7/SM-1/A-1/APS-1/SS-166) was a submarine of the United States Navy, the first boat to carry the name. &quot;Argonaut&quot; was laid down as V-4 on 1 May 1925 at Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 10 November 1927, sponsored by Mrs. Philip Mason Sears, the daughter of Rear Admiral William D. MacDougall, and commissioned on 2 April 1928. Although never officially designated as &quot;SS-166&quot;, at some point she displayed this number on her conning tower.

She was sunk by Japanese destroyers while engaging their convoy near Rabaul in Oceania on 10 January 1943, with the loss of 102 lives.

==Design==
&quot;V-4&quot; was the first of the second generation of V-boats commissioned in the late 1920s, which remain the largest non-nuclear submarines ever built by the United States. &quot;V-4&quot; was the behemoth of its class. These submarines were exempt by special agreement from the armament and tonnage limitations of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. Her configuration, and that of the following &quot;V-5&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot;, resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, suggested the need for long-range submarine &quot;cruisers&quot;, or &quot;strategic scouts&quot;, as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important. The design was possibly influenced by the German &quot;U-cruisers&quot; of the Type U-139 and Type U-151 U-boat classes, although &quot;V-4&quot;, &quot;V-5&quot;, and &quot;V-6&quot; were all larger than these. &quot;V-4&quot; and her near-sisters &quot;V-5&quot; () and &quot;V-6&quot; () were initially designed with larger and more powerful MAN-designed diesel engines than the Busch-Sulzer engines that propelled earlier V-boats, which were failures. The specially built engines failed to produce their design power, and some developed dangerous crankcase explosions. &quot;V-4&quot; was ultimately completed with smaller MAN diesels of , compared with for &quot;V-5&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot;. The smaller diesels were required to allow sufficient space for mine storage.

The engine specifications as built were two BuEng-manufactured, MAN-designed direct-drive 6-cylinder 4-cycle main diesel engines, each. A BuEng MAN 6-cylinder 4-cycle auxiliary diesel engine of , driving a Ridgway electric generator, was provided for charging batteries or for additional diesel-electric propulsion power.

A more successful propulsion improvement in &quot;V-4&quot; was the replacement of earlier submarines&#x27; pairs of 60-cell batteries with a pair of 120-cell batteries, thus doubling the available voltage to the electric motors when submerged. This battery configuration would be standard until the GUPPY program following World War II. &quot;V-4&quot; and her sisters were slow in diving and, when submerged, were unwieldy and slower than designed. They also presented an excellent target for surface ship sonar and had a large turning radius.

For the first time in U.S. submarine construction, the Portsmouth Navy Yard utilized welding during the assembly process. Led by Navy welding expert James W. Owens, welding was used in non-critical areas such as the superstructure, piping brackets, and support framing. &quot;V-4&quot; ended up being built to a mixed method construction, with both the inner and outer hulls still riveted. Owens was eager to expand the use of welding in ship construction, and its use on &quot;V-4&quot; was entirely successful. All subsequent submarines built for the USN used welding to some extent, with the method adopted in whole in 1936.

Designed primarily as a minelayer, and built at a cost of US$6,150,000, &quot;V-4&quot; was the first and only such specialized type ever built by the United States. She had four torpedo tubes forward and two minelaying tubes aft. At the time of construction, &quot;V-4&quot; was the largest submarine ever built in the U.S., and was the largest in U.S. Navy service for 30 years.

Her minelaying arrangements were &quot;highly ingenious, but extremely complicated&quot;, filling two aft compartments. A compensating tube ran down the center of the two spaces, to make up for the lost weight as mines were laid, as well as to store eight additional mines. The other mines were racked in three groups around this tube, two in the fore compartment, one aft, with a hydraulically driven rotating cage between them. Mines were moved by hydraulic worm shafts, the aft racks connecting directly to the launch tubes, which had vertically sliding hydraulic doors (rather than the usual hinged ones of torpedo tubes). Each launch tube was normally loaded with four mines, and a water &#x27;round mines (WRM) tube flooded to compensate as they were laid, then pumped into the compensating tube. Eight mines could be laid in 10 minutes.

==Interwar period==
Following commissioning, &quot;V-4&quot; served with Submarine Division 12 based at Newport, Rhode Island.

She proved perennially underpowered, but engine replacement was postponed by war, and her MAN diesels were a constant source of trouble.

In January–February 1929, &quot;V-4&quot; underwent a series of trials off Provincetown, Massachusetts. On a trial dive during this period, she submerged to a depth of . This mark was the greatest depth an American submarine had reached up to that time. On 26 February 1929, &quot;V-4&quot; was assigned to Submarine Division 20 (SubDiv 20), and arrived at San Diego, California on 23 March. From there, she participated in battle exercises and made cruises along the West Coast.

In 1931, the &quot;V-4&quot; was heavily featured in &quot;Seas Beneath&quot;, an American action film directed by John Ford. The &quot;V-4&quot; was repainted to appear as a World War I German submarine, the fictional &#x27;U-172&#x27;. Argonaut also appeared as a German World War I U-boat in the post-Code 1931 film &quot;Suicide Fleet&quot;, about three US Navy sailors on a schooner submarine decoy Q-ship and their liberty adventures pursuing a beautiful Coney Island concessionaire. In this film she appeared as the &#x27;U-200.&#x27; &quot;Suicide Fleet&quot; starred William Boyd, who later found fame as Hopalong Cassidy, and featured a very young Ginger Rogers as the love interest in one of her first featured roles.

&quot;V-4&quot; was renamed Argonaut on 19 February 1931, and redesignated SM-1 (submarine, minelayer) on 1 July. On 30 June 1932, she arrived at Pearl Harbor, where she was assigned to SubDiv 7. She carried out minelaying operations, patrol duty, and other routine work. In October 1934 and again in May 1939, &quot;Argonaut&quot; took part in joint Army-Navy exercises in the Hawaiian operating area. &quot;Argonaut&quot; became the flagship of Submarine Squadron 4 (SubRon 4). The submarine returned to the West Coast in April 1941 to participate in fleet tactical exercises.

==World War II==

On 28 November 1941 &quot;Argonaut&quot;, commanded by Stephen G. Barchet left Pearl Harbor to patrol around Midway Island with as Midway Defense Group 7.2. She was notified by radio of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor when she surfaced a few minutes after sunset on 7 December. &quot;Argonaut&quot; set general quarters two hours later to investigate naval gunfire around Midway. While designed as a minelayer and not an attack submarine, &quot;Argonaut&quot; made the first wartime approach on enemy naval forces; but poor maneuverability prevented reaching a suitable position for surfaced torpedo launch against the two Japanese destroyers shelling Midway. One of the destroyers saw &quot;Argonaut&quot; as she dived to make a submerged second approach in the bright moonlight; but the destroyer was unable to locate the submerged submarine, and &quot;Argonaut&quot; was again unable to maneuver into position to launch torpedoes. After being held down all night, &quot;Argonaut&quot; surfaced at dawn to recharge batteries and was unsuccessfully bombed by a United States plane from Midway.

&quot;Argonaut″s&quot; dehumidifiers were ineffective at preventing condensation, which caused electrical fires, making various pieces of electrical machinery inoperative. Three crewmen were sick with high fevers, but President Roosevelt&#x27;s mention of &quot;Argonaut″s&quot; contribution to the war effort in a radio speech encouraged Barchet to resist the temptation to abort the patrol. By trimming the submarine 17 tons heavy, the crew was able to reduce diving time to 52 seconds by skillfully coordinated pumping between fore and aft ballast tanks; but that time was still considered too slow to avoid hostile aircraft. &quot;Argonaut&quot; successfully rendezvoused with at 06:00 20 January 1942, so the destroyer could escort her back to Pearl Harbor.

===Conversion to troop transport===
On 22 January 1942, she returned to Pearl Harbor and, after a brief stop, proceeded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard for major overhaul. While there, her diesels were replaced with General Motors Winton 12-258Ss totaling with hydraulic drive through reduction gears, and her minelaying gear was removed to prepare for conversion to a troop transport submarine. The auxiliary diesel generator was replaced by a GM Winton 8-268A and a GM Winton 4-268A. She was also fitted with a Torpedo Data Computer (lack of which likely inhibited her ability to score with torpedoes), new electronics, and two external stern torpedo tubes on the after casing, along with two stern deck stowage tubes. It appears she was not fitted with bow external torpedo tubes, as were &quot;Narwhal&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot;, as photos taken after the refit do not show them. On return to Pearl Harbor, the conversion to a troop transport submarine was &quot;hastily&quot; finished.

&quot;Argonaut&quot; returned to action in the South Pacific in August. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz assigned &quot;Argonaut&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot; to transport and land Marine Raiders on Makin Island in the Gilbert Islands for the Makin Raid. This move was designed to relieve pressure on American forces that had just landed on Guadalcanal. On 8 August, the two submarines embarked 120 troops of Companies A and B, 2nd Raider Battalion, and got underway for Makin. Conditions during the transit were unpleasant, and most of the marines became seasick. The convoy arrived off Makin on 16 August, and at 03:30 the next day the Marines began landing. Their rubber rafts were swamped by the sea and most of the outboard motors drowned. The Japanese—either forewarned or extraordinarily alert—were ready for the Americans&#x27; arrival. Snipers were hidden in the trees, and the landing beaches were in front of the Japanese forces instead of behind them as planned. However, by midnight of 18 August, the Japanese garrison of about 85 men was wiped out; radio stations, fuel, and other supplies and installations were destroyed, and all but 30 of the troops had been recovered.

===Sinking===
&quot;Argonaut&quot; arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 26 August. Her hull classification symbol was changed from SM-1 to APS-1 (transport submarine) on 22 September. She was never formally designated SS-166, but that hull number was reserved for her and a photo shows she occasionally displayed it. Her base of operations was transferred to Brisbane, Queensland, later in the year. In December, she departed Brisbane under Lieutenant Commander John R. Pierce to patrol the hazardous area between New Britain and Bougainville Island, south of Bismarck Archipelago. On 2 January 1943, &quot;Argonaut&quot; sank the Japanese gunboat &quot;Ebon Maru&quot; in the Bismarck Sea. On 10 January, &quot;Argonaut&quot; spotted a convoy of five freighters and their escorting destroyers, , and returning to Rabaul from Lae. By chance, a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraftwhich was out of bombswas flying overhead and witnessed &quot;Argonaut&quot; attack. A crewman on board the plane saw one destroyer hit by a torpedo, and the destroyers promptly counterattacking. &quot;Argonaut&quot; bow suddenly broke the water at an unusual angle. It was apparent that a depth charge had severely damaged the submarine. The destroyers continued circling &quot;Argonaut&quot;, pumping shells into her; she slipped below the waves and was never heard from again. One hundred and two officers and men went down with her, the worst loss of life for an American submarine in wartime. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 February.

Japanese reports made available at the end of the war recorded a depth charge attack followed by gunfire, at which time they &quot;destroyed the top of the sub&quot;.

On the basis of the report given by the USAAF flier who witnessed the attack in which &quot;Argonaut&quot; sank, she was credited with damaging a Japanese destroyer on her last patrol. (Postwar, the JANAC accounting gave her none.) Since none of the histories of the three escorting destroyers reports damage on 10 January 1943, the destroyer &quot;hit&quot; may have been a premature explosion.

Before her crew left for their third war patrol, they donated &quot;Argonaut&quot; bell. Nearly 20 months after her loss, the Submarine Memorial Chapel was built and dedicated on the Submarine Base in Pearl Harbor. The bell hanging in her steeple comes from &quot;Argonaut&quot;, and still rings today for services.

<doc id="405317" wikidata="Q7981055" url="?curid=405317" title="Well-formed element">
<text>In web page design, and generally for all markup languages such as SGML, HTML, and XML, a well-formed element is one that is either a) opened and subsequently closed, or b) an empty element, which in that case must be terminated; and in either case which is properly nested so that it does not overlap with other elements.

For example, in HTML: codice_1 is a well-formed element, while is not, since the bold element is not closed. 

In XHTML, and XML, empty elements (elements that inherently have no content) are terminated by putting a slash at the end of the &quot;opening&quot; (only) tag, e.g. etc. In HTML 4.01 and earlier, no slash is added to terminate the element. HTML5 does not require one, but it is often added for compatibility with XHTML and XML processing.

In a well-formed document, 
* all elements are well-formed, and
* a single element, known as the root element, contains all of the other elements in the document.

For example, the code below is not well-formed HTML, because the codice_2 and codice_3 elements overlap:

&lt;!-- WRONG! NOT well-formed HTML! --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal &lt;em&gt;emphasized &lt;strong&gt;strong emphasized&lt;/em&gt; strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Correct: Well-formed HTML. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal &lt;em&gt;emphasized &lt;strong&gt;strong emphasized&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;strong emphasized&lt;/em&gt; strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
In XML, the phrase &quot;well-formed document&quot; is often used to describe a text that follows all the syntactic rules as well-formedness rules in the XML specification: strictly speaking the phrase is tautological, since a text that does not follow these rules is not an XML document. The rules for well-formed XML documents go beyond the general requirements for the markup languages mentioned above. The additional rules include, for example, a rule to quote attribute values, case-sensitiveness of tag names, rules about the characters that can appear in names and elsewhere, the syntax of comments, processing instructions, entity references, and CDATA sections, and many other similar details. Sometimes the adjective well-formed is used to contrast with valid: a valid XML document is one that is not only well-formed, but also conforms to the grammar defined in its own DTD (Document Type Definition).</text><links>

<text>Expertization is the process of authentication of an object, usually of a sort that is collected, by an individual authority or a committee of authorities. The expert, or expert committee, examines the collectible and issues a certificate typically including:

* A statement of:
** Whether or not the item is authentic
** Identification of any damage to the item
** Identification of any repairs to the item
** Identification of any forgery or faked parts of the item
* A photo of the item

Some experts apply a mark or signature to the item attesting its genuineness.

Expertization is particularly common with valuable philatelic items, some of which are so often forged that they may be unsaleable without it.

<text>Craig McCaw (born August 11, 1949) is an American businessman and entrepreneur, a pioneer in the cellular phone industry. He is the founder of McCaw Cellular (now part of AT&amp;T Mobility) and Clearwire Corporation (now part of T-Mobile via the Sprint acquisition).

==Early life and cable TV beginnings==

McCaw is the second of four sons of Marion and J. Elroy McCaw. As a child, the family lived in the posh gated Highlands community north of Seattle, and McCaw attended Seattle&#x27;s private Lakeside School, where he was later given a Lakeside Distinguished Alumni Award. McCaw&#x27;s father was a broadcasting magnate and owner of Gotham Broadcasting Corporation. Gotham owned the New York City radio station WINS, which became one of the first stations to play rock and roll, with Alan Freed being one of the earliest famous disc jockeys on the station. McCaw&#x27;s father was in the business of buying and selling TV and radio stations, which brought in wealth but also incurred significant debts. Elroy entered the cable television business in the 1960s, and his four sons worked as linemen and door-to-door salesmen.

When Elroy McCaw died in 1969 at age 57, the only company not sold to repay the debt was the small cable company in Centralia, Washington, with an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 subscribers, that was in trust. While at Stanford, Craig joined Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (DKE), and in his senior year, he took the helm of the cable company and set out to rebuild his family name. He used the cash flows from his growing cable company to purchase other remote cable companies, resulting in a profitable conglomerate. By the 1980s, McCaw Cablevision was the 20th largest cable carrier in the US.

==Cellular telephone industry==

When the FCC held a lottery for cellular licenses in the early 1980s, many ordinary Americans became wealthy by winning the right to establish cellular systems in cities across America. In addition to entering the lottery himself, McCaw approached many other lottery winners and bought their cellular rights, which were already considered to be undervalued. Using the same tactic he&#x27;d used in cable TV, McCaw financed an aggressive cellular expansion by borrowing against and selling shares in the cable operation. 

After acquiring MCI&#x27;s cellular wing in 1986, the McCaw brothers sold the cable company to Cooke Cablevision (now part of Comcast). The combined cellular operation was a significant player in the field. In 1990, McCaw was the highest paid CEO in the US.

In 1994, the McCaw brothers sold McCaw Cellular to AT&amp;T Corporation for $11.5 billion. The company was renamed AT&amp;T Wireless. AT&amp;T Wireless was sold to Cingular in 2004 to become the nation&#x27;s largest wireless carrier.

Following the sale of McCaw Cellular, McCaw took interest in Nextel, a then-floundering wireless carrier. By April 1995 McCaw gained effective control of the company contributing, along with his brothers, $1.1 billion over time. Within four years Nextel grew significantly to become a challenging wireless competitor, servicing 3.6 million customers throughout the U.S. and ten of the largest international markets. In 1999 McCaw formed Nextel Partners, Inc. which was later acquired by Sprint Nextel, Inc., for $6.5 billion in 2006, following a $36 billion merger between Nextel and the Sprint Corporation in 2005.

==Later ventures==

Later that same year, McCaw founded NEXTLINK Communications, planning to enter the broadband and internet service provider market. In 2000, the company merged with Concentric Network and was renamed XO Communications. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002.

In 1994, McCaw and Bill Gates teamed up to form Teledesic, with an ambitious plan to form a broadband satellite communications system with hundreds of low Earth orbit satellites. In 2002, Teledesic halted satellite production; and in 2003, it sold its spectrum licenses.

In 2000, McCaw invested in New ICO, a refloating after bankruptcy of ICO Global Communications, a mobile-satellite service (MSS) constellation company. The company did not complete its planned satellite constellation.

In August 2004, McCaw founded Clearwire Corporation, a provider of wireless broadband Internet service. The company&#x27;s U.S. broadband network is deployed in markets ranging from major metropolitan areas to small, rural communities.

At the end of 2007, Clearwire offered service in 46 markets in the U.S. as well as four markets in Europe.

McCaw, who served as Chairman of Clearwire until December 31, 2010, once said to an interviewer, &quot;Filling a need that others aren&#x27;t addressing has always been a focus of the companies that I have been involved with.&quot;

In November 2008, Clearwire completed a landmark transaction with Sprint combining their next-generation wireless broadband businesses into a new wireless communications company, which retained the name Clearwire. With the closing, Sprint contributed all of its 2.5 GHz spectrum and its WiMAX-related assets, including its XOHM business, to Clearwire. In addition, Clearwire received a $3.2 billion cash investment from Comcast, Intel, Time Warner Cable, Google and Bright House Networks.

The new company traded on the NASDAQ as CLWR. As part of the announcement, then Clearwire Chairman Craig McCaw said, &quot;The power of the mobile Internet, which offers speed and mobility, home and away, on any device or screen, will fundamentally transform the communications landscape in our country. We believe that the new Clearwire will operate one of the fastest and most capable broadband wireless networks ever conceived, giving us the opportunity to return the U.S. to a leadership position in the global wireless industry.&quot;

In January 2009, Clearwire launched its first 4G mobile WiMAX network in Portland, Oregon, making it only the second city after Baltimore to offer a high-speed network at true broadband speeds. By the end of 2010, the company had expanded its 4G network to 71 markets in the U.S. covering more than 110 million people.

==Political activities==
McCaw is a major Republican donor, and has been described as a &#x27;bundler&#x27; for the 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney. He has supported Jon Huntsman, John McCain, and George W. Bush. In 2012, McCaw donated $500,000 to American Crossroads.

==Personal life==
McCaw was a founding donor and underwriter of the Free Willy Foundation (along with Warner Brothers Studios) from 1993 to 2002, with an original $2 million donation. The foundation was formed to release the orca Keiko, star of the 1993 film &quot;Free Willy&quot;, back into the wild. It was later known as the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation.

McCaw was previously married to Wendy McCaw, a California newspaper publisher. They divorced in 1997. McCaw was married to Susan Rasinski McCaw, an investment banker and former United States Ambassador to Austria. They have three children together, Chase McCaw, Julia McCaw, and Reid McCaw.

In 1999, McCaw bought a house in Hunts Point, Washington from Kenny G.

McCaw is currently on the Board of Overseers for the Hoover Institution and serves on the boards of The Nature Conservancy, the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, and the Friends of Nelson Mandela Foundation. He is president of the Craig and Susan McCaw Foundation, which supports a variety of educational, environmental, and international economic development projects. McCaw has also served on the boards of Conservation International, the Grameen Technology Center, the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, and the Academy of Achievement.

McCaw is a significant car collector, and once amassed a collection of 400 cars with his brother, Bruce. In 2012 McCaw paid $35 million for a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, setting a new record for the most expensive car ever sold. The 250 GTO was originally built for Stirling Moss, who never raced the car. It was driven at the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans by Innes Ireland and Masten Gregory.

, Craig McCaw is no longer on the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 List of Wealthiest Americans.

<doc id="405322" wikidata="Q1234084" url="?curid=405322" title="Yami to Bōshi to Hon no Tabibito">
<text>, also known as &quot;Yamibō&quot;/&quot;Yamibou&quot; for short, is a Japanese adult visual novel published in December 2002 by Root. A 13-episode anime series produced by Studio Deen aired between October and December 2003. Although the characters and their relationships remain basically the same in the game and anime, the storyline is different.

==Plot==

===Game===
The game begins with a girl who is taken to a strange, magical realm by a dragon. She apparently was taken to the library where all past, present, and future realities are kept within the books. The player is a young man who has come from one of these books as well, but has forgotten his way back home. The player is commissioned to find the missing girl by the denizens of the library, and starts his search by entering different books.

===Anime===
The story follows the travels of Hazuki Azuma, a tall, brooding high-school girl, as she searches for her adopted older sister and love interest, Hatsumi, in many different &quot;book worlds&quot;. After the disappearance of her sister, a talking parakeet nicknamed Ken-chan introduces Hazuki to Lilith, the caretaker of the Great Library. Each book in the library contains a different world, and the guardian of the library takes on the title Yami.

==Characters==
:
:Hazuki is a very tall, quiet and serious girl, with long dark blue hair and sharp blue eyes. She uses the relatively masculine first person pronoun &quot;boku&quot;. She appears to be very popular among girls, with admirers developing crushes on her on many occasions both in school and in several book worlds. Hazuki is cold and unfriendly, but not particularly rude (e.g. throwing away the gift that a female admirer gave her as soon as the girl went out of sight). She is deeply in love and is fiercely protective of Hatsumi, is shown to have been masturbated to the thought of Hatsumi&#x27;s body and fended off boys trying to approach the girl.
:
:Hatsumi is Hazuki&#x27;s adopted older sister and love interest. Hatsumi appears to be mute (though it is proven otherwise on several occasions) and communicates mostly through gestures and facial expressions. Despite being older, Hatsumi is much shorter than Hazuki. Although it seems that Hazuki&#x27;s love is one-sided, episode seven shows that Hatsumi does have feelings for Hazuki and was trying to express herself as best as she could with the knowledge that she cannot stay beyond her sixteenth birthday (suggestions of this were shown along the way by her sending Hazuki anonymous love letters—later expressed in full and in words toward the end of the anime). In the first episode, Hatsumi disappears in a burst of green light (&quot;sōma&quot;) at midnight on her sixteenth birthday, as Hazuki tries to steal a kiss in her sleep. The events that follow lead Hazuki to a mysterious library in another dimension, in which all the worlds are kept in books. Hazuki learns from the Library guardian, Lilith, that Hatsumi is only one of the forms of the previous guardian (Eve), and that Eve stays in different books for fun until she turns sixteen.
:
:Lilith is the guardian of the library. She is the third Yami, after Adam, the creator of all the worlds, and Eve. In the anime, Lilith is attracted to Hazuki and flirts relentlessly, though she is always turned down. Lilith appears to dislike Eve and have interest only in her own ends, but her kind and vulnerable sides are sometimes shown, especially when she encounters children in trouble; adults do not seem to move her to compassion as much. Her more childish mannerisms are fairly constant, but Lilith sometimes shows considerable wisdom and knowledge. She claims that Eve left the duty of being Yami and went off to play in the book worlds, and so she wants to find Eve and return her to the library.
:
:Ken is a yellow cockatiel who can talk. In the anime, he accompanies Lilith in her travels, while in the game he accompanies the nameless main character. He speaks in very heavy Kansai-ben. Ken is loud, obnoxious, lecherous and perverted, as well as overly confident and a bit too slow to stay out of trouble. He usually ends up punched, squashed, beaten or otherwise violated, either as a result of tasks given to him by Lilith, or because of his big mouth and perverted tendencies. In the game, his true form is a kendappa and he is working for Arya. He serves as a comic relief in the series.
:
:Arya is a mysterious silver-haired boy who appears in every episode of the anime and during certain times in the game. In the anime he claims to be cleaning up after Hazuki and Lilith. Also, he offers to perform repairs on Tamamonomae&#x27;s Space Hall. He is always cosplaying as some type of character or animal. At the end of the anime series, he is shown closing a book that seems to contain the world of the Book Keepers. He is the main narrator of the story, and his short exits and introductions are often the only transition between stories.
:
:Kogechibi lives in the library, and looks like a four-inch (102 mm) tall Eve, though with different colored eyes. &quot;Koge&quot; refers to the one-eyed cloak that covers all of her but the eyes. In the game, when the main character is occupying &quot;Koge&quot;, the girl is referred to as &quot;O-chibi-chan&quot; (&quot;o&quot; being an honorific and &quot;chan&quot; an endearment). Kogechibi&#x27;s vocabulary is composed of unintellible sounds akin to baby talk. In the anime, she has a disturbing love of fireworks and can say a few words if they have something to do with explosives. She plays a small part in the plot, but is mostly comic relief in the anime. In the game, it is revealed that the guardians &quot;fragment&quot; when they overexert themselves, and that the fragments take on a life of their own. Kogechibi is a fragment of Eve.
:
:Gargantua appears in episode two of the anime as a madman, with three bumbling demonic henchmen and a servant named Seiren (derived from the Hellenic Siren). His main goal is to find Eve who is present as the mute, magic-using Jill, assistant caretaker of the orphanage. Gargantua is fiercely attached to her, and accidentally stabs her fatally with a knife when he jealously tries to dislodge a fellow orphan, Ritsuko, from Jill&#x27;s arms. Jill&#x27;s body disappears in an explosion of souma, drenching the two children in her life force. In the game, Gargantua and the main character both hold and try to acquire more fragments of Eve. For a while, Gargantua takes over Joe Harry and the command of the &quot;hunters&quot; (smaller, one-eyed hat-looking creatures). At the end of the anime, thanks to Eve and Tamamonomae, Gargantua has a change of heart and returns to the realm Lilith gave him for the sacrifice of princess Mariel, taking Ritsuko with him.
:
:Ritsuko is an immortal magic user and appears no older than 25, despite being over a century old. Ritsuko travels the countryside performing healing miracles. She has never forgotten Jill or Gargantua, and carries small portraits of them in her locket. When she comes to the castle to heal Princess Mariel, she is taken in as the court alchemist. While escorting the princess around the village, Ritsuko meets Gargantua, who is also immortal because of Jill&#x27;s souma and has learned dark magic. He kidnaps Princess Mariel and tries to sacrifice her to Lilith, in order to be shown where Eve is. Ritsuko stops him only too late and is framed for the kidnapping and thrown into a dungeon. Ritsuko is a user of sexual magic in the game, and one of the bodies occupied by the player is under her spell. She has a clone who was made by future herself, which is also seen travelling through the books with two children. At the end of the anime, thanks to some interference by Eve and Tamamonomae, Gargantua returns for Ritsuko, freeing her from her cell and taking her back with him to his own realm.
:
:Milka appears in episode six under the care of Seiren. She is a girl with a cruel past who is trapped in her five-year-old body. Milka lives on an island, and has no one to befriend but Seiren and her white tiger, Rascaless. Her initial caretaker was an older woman who used to whip the child as a punishment for such trivial offences. Eventually, the old woman is killed by Rascaless when Milka is not watching. Initially afraid of Hazuki and Lilith, she warms up to them and has Seiren take them to the villa at the center of the island. In the game, Milka is sent to live on the island by her older brother, for whom she has romantic feelings, because of her poor health. Seiren sings on the cliffs everyday to keep all of Milka&#x27;s brother&#x27;s soldiers under her spell, and Milka on the island. After Seiren and Lilith&#x27;s reconciliation, Milka goes back to her brother with Rascaless.
:
:Fujihime appears in a book-world that corresponds to the samurai era of Japan. Fujihime looks like Hatsumi, but has purple eyes instead of red. Fujihime is not another form of Eve. She is the spirit of a Japanese wisteria (called Fuji) who is gifted power from Eve. She can talk, and possesses the comb with which Hatsumi was using, in modern-day Japan.
:
:Meirin is a cheerful, wily kitsune girl with two tails who is trying to &quot;raise her rank&quot; by getting close to the princess. The player of the game meets Meirin after he enters a body, the previous owner of which she unintentionally kills. To make up for it, she takes him to Fujihime.
:
:Lala is the monolithic AI controlling the spaceship upon which Hazuki and the others find themselves in episode ten. The ship is an &quot;emigration spaceship&quot; taking the former inhabitants of Earth on a search for a new home planet. None of the passengers appear over ten years old, yet they have been drifting for over two hundred years. Hazuki and Lilith discover that all the adults died in a plague nine years ago. Eve appeared in this world as Lular over a hundred years ago, and had vanished on her sixteenth birthday while fixing a malfunctioning part. This futuristic world and its characters do not appear in the game.
:
:Tamaonomae appears to be Meirin&#x27;s future form as a kitsune woman with nine tails, though she exists in a different world. The world is not book world, it is named Sen-Kai, which is greater than the library. In the anime, she and Meirin may simply be alternative versions of one another; she described Meirin as her &quot;other self&quot;, which in context may mean that Meirin is her creation or an independent creature which fissioned off from Tamamonomae. But in another (but same company&#x27;s) game, she is a really Meirin&#x27;s future form. Despite her sexual and alcoholic tendencies, is not an unsympathetic character; she has considerable insight into people and does some fairly altruistic things for some of the other characters; she restores Mariel to human form, helps Gargantua to acknowledge the truth, returns the Hat to Eve and finally seems to have taken Gargantua&#x27;s henchmen in as permanent guests.
:
:Seiren is a beautiful, blue-haired woman who initially appears as Gargantua&#x27;s ally in the anime. He describes her as a devil, but apparently trusts her, using her aid in his search for Eve. Seiren holds a grudge against Lilith, claiming that she was abandoned by her. She is most upset when they meet again on Milka&#x27;s island and Lilith does not even remember her.
:
:A woman who appears in a book-world that corresponds to the Russo-Japan War era. She is an intelligence agent and an expert martial artist noted for sending three colleagues into hospital during training. Yōko arrives on a train somewhere corresponding to contemporary Russian Siberia, cross-dressing as a male diplomat and attempting to link up with fellow agent Kohtaro Nanbu, codenamed &quot;Adam&quot;, for a film containing radio codes.
:
:A princess in Ritsuko and Gargantua&#x27;s world. One day, when she is placed under Ritsuko&#x27;s care, she meets Gargantua and eventually develops a crush on him. She is later kidnapped and sacrificed to Lilith by Gargantua, committing suicide by poison, but is reincarnated and employed as a maid by Tamamonomae.

==Adaptations==

===Manga===
There is a one-book manga adaptation, &quot;Yami to Bōshi to Hon no Tabibito ~Romance&quot;, illustrated by Aya Sakurai. It is a compressed version of the game&#x27;s events, following the storyline that leads to a romantic relationship between the nameless main character and Lilith.

===Anime===
A 13-episode anime television series adaptation was produced by Avex mode and Studio Deen and directed by Yūji Yamaguchi, with Tomomi Mochizuki handling series scripts, Asako Nishida designing the characters, Tomochi Kosaka designing the props and Akifumi Tada composing the music. As a UHF anime, it aired in Japan between October 2 and December 25, 2003, on MBS-affiliated networks for 13 episodes. The anime&#x27;s opening theme is &quot;Hitomi no Naka no Meikyū&quot; by Aiko Kayō and the ending theme is &quot;Eien no Inori o Sasagete&quot; by Sanae Kobayashi. The anime was licensed for release in North America by Anime Works. It will be broadcast on Toku beginning on July 19, 2016.

Although there was frequent mention in the anime&#x27;s pre-broadcast publicity that &quot;all the characters will appear&quot;, copyright-infringing characters, such as Erosuke and the train conductor, as well as some male and non-human characters, did not make an appearance.

====Episodes====
===Video game===
A spin-off game exists known as was released in 2004, it intended to teach typing skills. It was based on the anime and even uses screencaps from it.

==Reception==
Theron Martin of Anime News Network called the series a &quot;true oddity&quot; for not being picked up for an English sub by Media Blasters until 2013, but was not released until 2016. He also called the series odd because it does not &quot;resemble anything else out there&quot; as it has its origins in an adult visual novel and noted that the storytelling approach is not linear, with the mechanics for the world-shifting in the series being &quot;an interdimensional library&quot;. He said that while the storytelling is strong, some characters appear but are never explored, humor is weak, and criticized the animation style. Even so, he said that the character designs are strong, adding that the series has fan service, the yuri element is not very pervasive, and says that the series has a diverse set of music. He concluded that while watching the series is one that &quot;requires some patience&quot;, viewers will &quot;be rewarded&quot; through their time watching the series, making it worth their while.

<doc id="405327" wikidata="Q2985962" url="?curid=405327" title="Louis Cyr">
<text>Louis Cyr (; born Cyprien-Noé Cyr; October 10, 1863 – November 10, 1912) was a Canadian strongman with a career spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Based on his recorded feats, including lifting with one finger and backlifting , former International Fitness and Bodybuilding Federation chairman Ben Weider stated in 2000, that Cyr is the strongest man ever. Since his strength was so far above and beyond the ordinary during his time, he and his contemporary Louis &#x27;Apollon&#x27; Uni were collectively called the &#x27;Kings of Strength&#x27;.

== Early years ==
Cyr was born in Saint-Cyprien-de-Napierville, Canada East. Coming from a French-Canadian family, he began developing his extraordinary strength at an early age. From the age of twelve Cyr worked in a lumber camp during the winters and on the family&#x27;s farm the rest of the year. Discovering his exceptional strength at a very young age, he impressed his fellow workers with his feats of strength. After learning of the tale, Cyr attempted to mimic the practice of legendary strongman Milo of Croton, who as a child carried a calf on his shoulders, continuing to carry it as it grew into a full-grown bull and he into a grown man. Cyr&#x27;s calf, however, bolted one day, kicking him in his back, after which he instead began carrying a sack of grain every day, adding each day. According to one of his biographers, his mother decided &quot;He should let his hair grow, like Samson in the Bible&quot;. She curled it regularly.

Louis started his strong man career at the age of 17, after some publicity came about due to an incident when the young Louis was reported to have lifted a farmer&#x27;s heavily laden wagon out of the mire in which it had become stuck. He was matched in a contest against Michaud of Quebec, who was recognized as Canada&#x27;s strongest man of the time. Cyr beat him in tests of lifting of heavy stones by hoisting a granite boulder weighing .

In 1878, the Cyr family immigrated to Lowell, Massachusetts in the United States. In Lowell, Cyr changed his name from Cyprien-Noé to Louis, as it was easier to pronounce in English. Again, his great strength brought him fame. At 17 years old, he weighed . He entered his first strongman contest in Boston at age 22, lifting a horse off the ground. The fully grown male horse was placed on a platform with two iron bars attached, which enabled Cyr to obtain a better grip. The horse weighed at least .

== Rise to fame ==

In 1882, while working as a logger, Louis married Melina Comtois. The following year he and his wife returned to Lowell, hoping to capitalize on his fame there. A tour of the Maritimes was organized, and while it may have benefited the organizer, Cyr gained no profit financially. He then began touring Quebec with his family in a show they called &quot;The Troupe Cyr&quot;.

Soon proving his immense strength, he was urged by friends to enter the exciting, albeit highly precarious world of professional strong men, lifting mainly crude solid or shot-filled weights.

From 1883 to 1885, Cyr served as a police officer in Montreal, Quebec. Following this, he went on tour with a troupe that included a wrestler, a boxer, and a weightlifter. He entered a strongman competition in March 1886, at Quebec City, against the reigning Canadian strongman, David Michaud. Cyr lifted a barbell with one hand (to Michaud&#x27;s ) and a weight of on his back, to his opponent&#x27;s to win the title of strongest man in the country.

With little reward at this early foray into professional weightlifting, Louis was forced to seek other employment. Cyr became a police officer after breaking up a knife fight and carrying both participants to the police station.

Prudent with his earnings, Louis left the police force and purchased a tavern/restaurant in St. Cunégonde, where he also featured a gymnasium that became a mecca for strength athletes and fighters. Cyr was well acquainted with John L. Sullivan, being one of the few to defy Sullivan&#x27;s commands to drink when he drank. Sullivan was known as The Boston Strong Boy and was very powerful, but not in Cyr&#x27;s class. Cyr, happy in his own environment, beat all comers when challenged to perform.

Cyr&#x27;s exploits had been well publicized in the &#x27;Pink Un&#x27; or Police Gazette published by Richard K. Fox, the proprietor and promoter of other strength athletes, e.g. Travis, Eugen Sandow, etc. Fox offered a side bet of $5,000 to anyone who could beat Cyr at any of his strength feats. Promoted by Fox, Louis went on tour circa 1885–1891 beating, amongst others: Sebastian Miller, Bienkowski, or Cyclops, August Johnson, and Richard Pennell, plus continually challenging, without success, Eugen Sandow, with a genuine diamond studded belt to be awarded to the winner, should such an event ever take place. It never did. Sandow avoided any such challenges throughout his esteemed career after early mistakes, like the time he was beaten by McCann.

There was no doubt that Cyr was an unusual man regarding size and measurements, the latter often causing debate. Although Dr. Dudley A. Sargent, famous Harvard University physical director recorded measuring Cyr in 1895 when Cyr was 32 years old and weighed . Sargent listed Cyr&#x27;s height as 5&#x27;8.5&quot;. Other measurements, most on the conservative side as compared to other biographers, were neck – , biceps – , forearms – , wrists – , chest (normal) – , chest expanded – , waist - , hips – , thighs – , knees – 17&quot;, and calves - , far short of the quoted 28&quot;, but perhaps a possible 23&quot; later when of higher body weight. Ankle and Shoulder width with calipers ... across the deltoids . The above details were just one set of figures relating to Cyr&#x27;s size, others being recorded by Willoughby when for example Cyr was 47 years old (in 1910) gave him calf 23&quot;, neck 22 3/4&quot;, biceps 21 1/2&quot;. chest normal 59 1/2&quot; and thighs 33&quot; with other parts to match the increase in weight, being at the time a heavier 365 lbs. Ben Weider, who was privileged to access family archives, was even more generous giving arm size , forearms , and calves, the disputed , following a similar line to Jowett.

== Reputation as a Strongman ==

While several of Cyr&#x27;s feats of strength may have been exaggerated over the years, some were documented and remain impressive.
These included:
* lifting a platform on his back holding 18 men for a total of 
* lifting a weight with one finger
* pushing a freight car up an incline
* At 19 years old, he lifted a rock from ground up to his shoulder, officially weighted at 514 pounds
* He beat Eugen Sandow&#x27;s bent press record (and therefore the heaviest weight lifted with one hand) by to a total of .

===Backlift===
Perhaps his greatest feat occurred in 1895, when he was reported to have lifted on his back in Boston by putting 18 men on a platform and lifting them. One of his most memorable displays of strength occurred in Montreal on 12 October 1891. Louis resisted the pull of four draught horses (two in each hand) as grooms stood cracking their whips to get the horses to pull harder, a feat he again demonstrated in Ottawa with Queen Victoria&#x27;s team of draught horses during her royal visit. While in Ottawa he volunteered with the police when they took deputies to round up a local gang of miscreants; they turned him away claiming he would be too slow due to his bulk. He challenged the regular officers to a foot race, beating the majority, and they took him on.

He patrolled as a police officer between 1883 and 1885 in Sainte-Cunégonde, known now as Petite-Bourgogne (Little Burgundy) in Montreal. Both the Parc Louis-Cyr and the &quot;Place des Hommes-Forts&quot; (&quot;Strongmen&#x27;s Square&quot;) are named after him. Statues of him are located at &quot;Place des Hommes-Forts&quot; and the &quot;Musée de la Civilisation&quot; in Quebec City. The high school in his hometown of Napierville is also named after him.
Through no fault of his own, many of Cyr&#x27;s lifts, like his measurements, have been exaggerated or misquoted. In particular, his celebrated back lift done in Boston, of 18 men on a platform, is usually generously estimated at 4,300 lb, which allowing for a very heavy platform of at most 500 lb, meant that each man on average would have weighed approximately 211 lb.

===Cyr dumbbell===
Cyr was also credited with side pressing with &quot;one arm&quot; (the right), a lift witnessed by Britain&#x27;s great champion Tom Pevier, who described it more like a &#x27;jerk press.&#x27; The dumbbell, a huge thick-handled one, was lifted to the shoulders with two hands, before the single-handed overhead move. Cyr&#x27;s dumbbells were often so unwieldy that many respectable strongmen were unable to lift them off the floor, let alone lift them overhead.

One particular dumbbell of Cyr&#x27;s weighed, when empty, . It was the same bell that had defeated a drove of former strength athletes, and it was exchanged by its owner, 280 lb. police chief Joseph Moquin of Quebec (who could and did bent press the weight) for a modern set of York weights. Thus, it came into the possession of the late Bob Hoffman and Mike Dietz. According to &quot;Strength &amp; Health&quot; magazine, Hoffman, after several attempts, was able to bent press it, as did the much lighter 150 lb. Sig Klein. John Grimek later also bent pressed it, half a dozen times or so one afternoon, when the weight was increased to 269.5 lb, by adding, as it happened, the lead type from Mark Berrys&#x27; classic tome Physical Training Simplified. Hence the reason the book was never reprinted.

Cyr was a big man in all ways, both in heart and in size. Being a great trencherman, he ate more than four normal men. Up to 6 lb of meat at one meal. A genuine gourmand, he increased his weight enormously in his later years. His lightest bodyweight was when he competed against August Johnson, then just 270 lb, although his normal contest condition was nearer 320 lb. Cyr&#x27;s wife, Melina, by contrast, never weighed more than 100 lb.

In 1886, Cyr met and defeated Richard Pennell, who was then 40, and Louis just 23. On 1 October 1888 at Berthierville, Quebec, he lifted 3,536 lb/ 1,604 kg of pig iron for his first record in the back lift.

On 1 December 1891 at Sohmer Park in Montreal, before some 10,000 people, Cyr resisted the pull of four draught horses, two on each side, despite grooms cracking their whips to encourage the horses to pull harder and strain their haunches.

In January 1892, Cyr embarked in England with partner Horace Barré, arousing much interest and curiosity at his London debut at the Royal Aquarium, with 5,000 people packing the theater to watch Cyr&#x27;s act and witness his open challenge to the wide world of strongmen, many celebrities of which were in the audience, with a side wager of £1,000 (Equivalent to about £98,070 as of 2015). It was on this historical occasion, on 19 January 1892 that Cyr pressed the pre-mentioned 273.75 lb. dumbbell. Many years later Doc Aumont, son-in-law of Louis, loaned Cyr&#x27;s famous dumbbell to the Weider&#x27;s Your Physique office in Montreal for a month, during which time over 500 people tried and failed to lift the weight.

During his first London show, many other feats followed, all exceeding contemporary records, culminating in the famous Backlift. Placing a number of men upon a heavy platform resting across two trestles, Louis ducked beneath the platform, placed his back below the center, and raised both the contraption and the passengers clear off the trestles. Weight on this occasion was estimated at 3,635 lb. Traveling extensively throughout the UK he also visited Scotland, raising and carrying for a distance one of the famed Dinnie Stones. Cyr was very popular in Britain, being feted by celebrities and Royalty alike, including the Prince of Wales and Queen Victoria.

After returning to the U.S.A. on 27 May, Cyr did his best back lift in Boston, with over 4,000 lb estimated, consisting of 18 &#x27;bulky&#x27; men.

===Clean and jerk===
During his most active period, circa 1896, on March 31 he did a &quot;clean and jerk&quot; (the clean is a misnomer) of 347 lb, then a World record, without science or skill, little if any dipping.

Reputable witness Oscar Mathes said the lift was closer to a straight-legged press. Cyr did a one-handed deadlift with a dumbbell weighing , made harder by the fact that the bar was 1.5 inches thick. On 7 and 8 May 1896, he performed a crucifix with in his right hand, and in his left. Some authors often credit him with holding out with one arm.- . He also dumbbell pressed 162 lb for 36 reps, did a one finger lift, first with 552 lb and the next day made it . Lifted via one hand, style not specified, but most suspect using hand and thigh method, . plus again, using hand and thigh, .

For years, Louis pictured himself as a modern Biblical Samson with tresses to match. In the folds of his long hair, he would tie three fifty-pound weights, one on each side, and one in the center, with the three weights dangling from his scalp, he would also spin around, swirling the weights around his head. By co-incidence on his visit to Britain, the top of the pops was a ditty entitled &#x27;Get Your Hair Cut.&quot; Louis must have taken the hint - he always sported short hair after the song&#x27;s release.

More power of the arm and shoulder was demonstrated by his stunt of stacking four fifty pound weights one on top of the other on his half flexed arm, balancing them whilst walking across the room.

==Wrestling a giant==
Cyr learned boxing and wrestling for a match. While in Montréal, Que., 25 March 1901, Louis Cyr wrestled Édouard Beaupré, who was known as a giant man. Cyr&#x27;s height was measured at and he weighed . Beaupré&#x27;s height was measured at and he weighed . Cyr won.

==Death==

By 1904, Cyr&#x27;s health began to fail due to excessive eating and inactivity. At the time, he weighed . He slimmed down as best he could for his last contest of strength, with Hector De Carrie. Cyr retained his title and retired unvanquished.

Cyr died on November 10, 1912, in Montreal, of chronic nephritis and was interred at St-Jean-De-Matha. Great homage was paid by all of Canada, with immense crowds attending the funeral and floral tributes coming from all over the world.

He was portrayed by Antoine Bertrand in the 2013 biographical film &quot;Louis Cyr, l&#x27;homme le plus fort du monde&quot;.

<text>The little bunting (Emberiza pusilla) is a passerine bird belonging to the bunting family (Emberizidae).

==Taxonomy==
First described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776, the little bunting is a monotypic species, with no geographical variation across its extensive Palearctic range.

The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting. The specific &quot;pusilla&quot; is Latin for &quot;very small&quot;.

==Description==
This is a small bunting, measuring only in length. It has white underparts with dark streaking on the breast and sides. With its chestnut face and white malar stripe, it resembles a small female reed bunting, but has black crown stripes, a white eye-ring, and a fine dark border to the rear of its chestnut cheeks. The sexes are similar.

The call is a distinctive &quot;zik&quot;, and the song is a rolling &quot;siroo-sir-sir-siroo&quot;.

==Ecology==
The little bunting breeds across the taiga of the far north-east of Europe and northern Eurosiberia to the Russian Far East. It is migratory, wintering in the subtropics in northern India, southern China and the northern parts of south-east Asia. The birds remain in their winter quarters for quite long; specimens were taken in Yunnan in late March. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe. This species is adaptable; in the mountains of Bhutan for example, where small numbers winter, it is typically found in an agricultural habitat, mostly between ASL.

It breeds in open coniferous woodland, often with some birch or willow. Four to six eggs are laid in a tree nest. Its natural food consists of seeds, or when feeding young, insects.

A common and widely-ranging species, it is not considered threatened on the IUCN Red List.

<doc id="405353" wikidata="Q783575" url="?curid=405353" title="Pacific cod">
<text>The Pacific cod (&quot;Gadus macrocephalus)&quot; is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Gadidae. It is a bottom-dwelling fish found in the northern Pacific Ocean, mainly on the continental shelf and upper slopes, to depths of about . It can grow to a length of a meter or so and is found in large schools. They feed on clams, worms, crabs, shrimp, and juvenile fish. It is an important commercial food species and is also known as gray cod or grey cod, and grayfish or greyfish. Fishing for this species is regulated with quotas being allotted for hook and line fishing, pots, and bottom trawls. Fossils have been found in Canada near a Steller Sea lion fossil dating to the Pleistocene. 

==Description==
It has three separate dorsal fins, and the catfish-like whiskers on its lower jaw. In appearance, it is similar to the Atlantic cod. A bottom dweller, it is found mainly along the continental shelf and upper slopes with a range around the rim of the North Pacific Ocean, from the Yellow Sea to the Bering Strait, along the Aleutian Islands, and south to about Los Angeles, down to depths of . It may grow up to in length and weigh up to . It is found in huge schools.

Molecular genetic analyses strongly suggest that Pacific cod and Greenland cod (&quot;Gadus ogac&quot;) from Greenland–Arctic Ocean are the same species and that &quot;G. ogac&quot; should be a junior synonym of &quot;G. macrocephalus&quot;. Today, ITIS and the Catalogue of Life list &quot;Gadus ogac&quot; as synonym of &quot;G. macrocephalus&quot;.

==Fisheries==

In the Northeast Pacific catches of Pacific cod by the United States trawl fishery and joint-venture fisheries increased from less than 1,000 tonnes in 1979 to nearly 91,000 tonnes in 1984 and reached 430,196 tonnes in 1995. Today, catches are tightly regulated and the Pacific cod quota is split among fisheries that use hook and line gear, pots, and bottom trawls.

==Conservation status==
The Salish Sea population of Pacific cod is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern, one of those species about which the U.S. government&#x27;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).

<doc id="405356" wikidata="Q326028" url="?curid=405356" title="Great Peace of Montreal">
<text>The Great Peace of Montreal () was a peace treaty between New France and 39 First Nations of North America that ended the Beaver Wars. It was signed on August 4, 1701, by Louis-Hector de Callière, governor of New France, and 1300 representatives of 39 Indigenous nations.

The French, allied to the Hurons and the Algonquins, provided 16 years of peaceful relations and trade before war started again. Present for the diplomatic event were the various peoples; part of the Iroquois confederacy, the Huron peoples, and the Algonquin peoples.

This has sometimes been called the Grand Settlement of 1701, not to be confused with the unrelated Act of Settlement 1701 in England. It has often been referred to as &quot;La Paix des Braves&quot;, meaning &quot;The Peace of the Braves&quot;.

== The Beaver Wars ==
The foundation of Quebec City in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain, one of the first governors of New France, marked the beginning of the gathering of resources of the Great Northern forests by traders from Metropolitan France. Control over the fur trade became a high-stakes game among the Native American tribes, as all of them wanted to be the European&#x27;s chosen intermediary. The Beaver Wars saw the Hurons and Algonquins, supported by the French, pitted against the Iroquois of the powerful League of Five Nations, who were supported first by New Netherlands, and later by the English when they took New Amsterdam in the 1660s and 1670s, renaming it New York City.

In the first half of the 17th century, the Dutch-allied Iroquois made substantial territorial gains against the French-allied First Nations, often threatening French settlements at Montreal and Trois-Rivières. In an attempt to secure the colony, in 1665 the Carignan-Salières Regiment was sent to New France. Their campaign in 1666 devastated a number of Mohawk communities, who were forced to negotiate a peace. A period of prosperity followed for France&#x27;s colony, but the Iroquois, now supported by the English, continued to expand their territory westward, fighting French allies in the Great Lakes region and again threatening the French fur trade. In the 1680s the French became actively involved in the conflict again, and they and their allied Indians made significant gains against the Iroquois, including incursions deep into the heartland of Iroquoia (present-day Upstate New York). After a devastating raid by the Iroquois against the settlement of Lachine in 1689, and the entry the same year of England into the Nine Years&#x27; War (known in the English colonies as King William&#x27;s War), Governor Frontenac organized raiding expeditions against English communities all along the frontier with New France. French and English colonists, and their Indian allies, then engaged in a protracted border war that was formally ended when the Treaty of Ryswick was signed in 1697. The treaty, however, left unresolved the issue of Iroquois sovereignty (both France and England claimed them as part of their empire), and French allies in the upper Great Lakes continued to make war on the Iroquois.

==Prelude to peace==

The success of these attacks, which again reached deep into Iroquois territory, and the inability of the English to protect them from attacks originating to their north and west, forced the Iroquois to more seriously pursue peace. Their demographic decline, aided by conflicts and epidemics, put their very existence into doubt. At the same time, commerce became almost nonexistent because of a fall in the price of furs. The Indians preferred to trade with the merchants of New York because these merchants offered better prices than the French.

Preliminary negotiations took place in 1698 and 1699, but these were to some degree frustrated by the intervention of the English, who sought to keep the Iroquois from negotiating directly with the French. After another successful attack into Iroquoia in early 1700, these attempts at intervention failed. The first conference between the French and Iroquois was held on Iroquois territory at Onondaga in March 1700. In September of the same year, a preliminary peace treaty was signed in Montreal with the five Iroquois nations. Thirteen First Nations symbols are on the treaty. After this first entente, it was decided that a bigger one would be held in Montreal in the summer of 1701 and all Nations of the Great Lakes were invited. Selected French emissaries, clergies and soldiers, all well-perceived by the First Nations, were given this diplomatic task. The negotiations continued during the wait for the big conference; the neutrality of the Five Nations was discussed in Montreal in May 1701. The treaty of La Grande Paix de Montreal of July 21 to August 7 of 1701 was signed as a symbol of peace between the French and the First Nations. In the treaty, the Five Nations agreed to remain peaceful between the French and the British during times of war together. It was a huge example of peace between different nations and honouring an agreement.

==Treaty ratification==
The first delegations arrived in Montreal at the beginning of the summer of 1701, often after long, hard journeys. The ratification of the treaty was not agreed to immediately due to the discussions between the First Nations representatives and Governor Callière&#x27;s dragging on, both sides being eager to negotiate as much as possible. The actual signing of the document took place on a big field prepared for the special occasion, just outside the city. The representatives of each Nation placed their clan&#x27;s symbol, such as turtle, wolf or bear, at the bottom of the document. A great banquet followed the solemn occasion, with a peace pipe being shared by the chiefs, each of them praising peace in turn. This treaty, achieved through negotiations according to First Nations diplomatic custom, was meant to end ethnic conflicts. From then on, negotiation would trump direct conflict and the French would agree to act as arbiters during conflicts between signatory tribes. The Iroquois promised to be neutral in case of conflict between the French and English colonies.

==Aftermath==
The treaty was highly symbolic for the aboriginal nations as the Tree of Peace was now established among all the Great Lakes&#x27; nations. Commerce and exploratory expeditions quietly resumed in peace after the signing of the treaty. The French explorer Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, Sieur de Cadillac left Montreal to explore the Great Lakes region, founding Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit (now Detroit) in July. Jesuit priests resumed their spiritual mission-based work in the north. The Great Peace of Montreal is a unique diplomatic event in the history of both North and South America. The treaty is still considered valid by the Indigenous people of the American First Nations tribes involved.

The French in negotiating followed their traditional policy in North and South America, where their relationship with some of the natives was characterized by mutual respect and admiration and based on dialogue and negotiation. According to the 19th-century historian Francis Parkman: &quot;Spanish civilization crushed the Indian; English civilization scorned and neglected him; French civilization embraced and cherished him.&quot;

==Commemoration==

A square in Old Montreal was renamed Place de la Grande-Paix-de-Montréal to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the peace. Several locations in Quebec are named for the Petun leader Kondiaronk, one of the architects of the peace, including the Kondiaronk Belvedere in Mount Royal Park overlooking downtown Montreal.

<text>The rustic bunting (Emberiza rustica) is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a group now separated by most modern authors from the finches, Fringillidae. The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting. The specific &quot;rustica&quot; is Latin for &quot;rustic, simple&quot;.

It breeds across the northern Palearctic. It is migratory, wintering in south-east Asia, Japan, Korea, and eastern China. It is a rare wanderer to western Europe.

It breeds in wet coniferous woodland. Four to six eggs are laid in a nest in a bush or on the ground. Its natural food consists of seeds, and when feeding young, insects.

This bird is similar in size to a reed bunting. It has white underparts with reddish flank, pink legs and a pink lower mandible. The summer male has a black head with a white throat and supercilium and a reddish breast band.

The female has a heavily streaked brown back and brown face with a whitish supercilium. She resembles a female reed bunting, but has the reddish flank streaks, a chestnut nape and a pink, not grey, lower mandible.

The call is a distinctive &quot;zit&quot;, and the song is a melancholic &quot;delee-deloo-delee&quot;.

<doc id="405359" wikidata="Q321242" url="?curid=405359" title="Osaka Castle">
<text>is a Japanese castle in Chūō-ku, Osaka, Japan. The castle is one of Japan&#x27;s most famous landmarks and played a major role in the unification of Japan during the sixteenth century of the Azuchi–Momoyama period.

==Layout==

The main keep of Osaka Castle is situated on a plot of land roughly one square kilometre. It is built on two raised platforms of landfill supported by sheer walls of cut rock, using a technique called burdock piling, each overlooking a moat. The keep is five stories on the outside and eight stories on the inside and built atop a tall stone foundation to protect its occupants from attackers.

The main keep is surrounded by a series of moats and defensive fortifications. The castle has two moats (an inner and an outer one). The inner castle moat lies within the castle grounds and consists of two types: wet (northern-easterly) and dry (south-westerly). The outer moat meanwhile surrounds the entire castle premise, denotes the castle&#x27;s outer limits, and consists of four individual water-filled sections, each representing a cardinal direction (North, East, South, West).

The castle grounds, which cover approximately 61,000 square metres (15 acres), contain the following thirteen structures that were denoted as &quot;important cultural assets&quot; by the Japanese government: 
*Ote-mon Gate
*Sakura-mon Gate 
*Ichiban-yagura Turret
*Inui-yagura Turret
*Rokuban-yagura Turret
*Sengan Turret
*Tamon Turret
*Kinmeisui Well
*Kinzo Storehouse
*Enshogura Gunpowder Magazine
*Three sections of &#x27;dobei&#x27; mud-and-plaster wall all located around the Otemon Gate; each has its own Important Cultural Property status

There are also some megaliths at the castle include the Octopus stone, but these have no cultural property status. The outer moat has two main sentry checkpoints: the Aoyamon Gate (in the north-east) and the Otemon Gate (in the opposing south-west).

Between the outer and inner moat are the following: Fushimi-yagura Turret Remains, Ensho-gura Gunpowder Storehouse, Osaka Geihinkan, Hoshoan Tea House, Osaka Castle Nishinomaru Garden, Sengan-yagura Turret, Tamon-yagura Turret, Remains of Taiko-yagura Turret, Osaka Shudokan Martial Arts Hall, Hokoku Shrine (Osaka), Ichiban-yagura Turret (The first turret), and Plum Grove.

There are two places to cross the inner moat, Gokuraku-bashi Bridge (located in the North) and Sakuramon Gate (main sentry point in the South).

Within the inner moat, the castle was divided into two major areas: the Hommaru (Inner Bailey) and the Yamazato-Maru Bailey. Located within the Hommaru is the Main Tower, the Kimmeisui Well, the Japanese Garden, the Takoishi (Octopus Stone), the Gimmeisui Well, the Miraiza Osakajo Complex, the Kinzo Treasure House, and the &quot;Timecapsule Expo&#x27;70&quot;. While within the Yamazato-Maru Bailey consists of the Marked-Stones Square, and the Monument commemorating &#x27;Hideyori and Yodo-dono committing suicide&#x27;.

As with almost all Japanese castles from the Azuchi-Momoyama period onward, the , the most prominent structure, was used as a storehouse in times of peace and as a fortified tower in times of war, and the &#x27;s government offices and residences were located in a group of single-story buildings near the &quot;tenshu&quot; and the surrounding .

==History==

In 1583 Toyotomi Hideyoshi commenced construction on the site of the Ikkō-ikki temple of Ishiyama Hongan-ji. The basic plan was modeled after Azuchi Castle, the headquarters of Oda Nobunaga. Hideyoshi wanted to build a castle that mirrored Nobunaga&#x27;s but surpassed it in every way: the plan featured a five-story main tower, with three extra stories underground, and gold leaf on the sides of the tower to impress visitors. In 1585 the Inner donjon was completed. Hideyoshi continued to extend and expand the castle, making it more and more formidable to attackers. In 1597 construction was completed and Hideyoshi died the year after. Osaka Castle passed to his son, Toyotomi Hideyori.

In 1614 Tokugawa Ieyasu besieged the Toyotomi clan forces in Osaka castle during the winter, starting the Siege of Osaka. Although the Toyotomi forces were outnumbered approximately two to one, they managed to fight off Tokugawa&#x27;s 200,000-man army and protect the castle&#x27;s outer walls. Ieyasu had the castle&#x27;s outer moat filled, negating one of the castle&#x27;s main outer defenses. During the summer of 1615, Hideyori began to restore the outer moat. Ieyasu, in outrage, sent his armies to Osaka Castle again, and routed the Toyotomi men inside the outer walls on June 4. Later, Osaka Castle fell to the Tokugawa shogunate and the Toyotomi clan perished, as Toyotomi Hideyori and Yodo-dono committed seppuku and the castle buildings burned to the ground.

As the Toyotomi clan no longer existed, the Tokugawa shogunate expressed their desire to move their center of government into Osaka. However, this plan to relocate the shogunate government into Osaka was halted after the death of Ieyasu in 1616. For a while, the shogunate&#x27;s plan to move to Osaka was abandoned, but was reinstated by Tokugawa Hidetada, who had a strong desire to establish a unified imperial and military government. In 1619, Matsudaira Tadaaki, who was appointed as the lord of Osaka Castle before, was transferred to the Kōriyama Domain in Yamato Province, and the shogunate assumed direct control of Osaka. Then, the project of reconstructing Osaka castle as a new base of the shogunate was entrusted to Tōdō Takatora and Kobori Enshu. In 1620, the old structures of Osaka Castle were completely dismantled so that the foundation for the new castle could be built. He assigned the task of constructing new walls to individual samurai clans. The walls built in the 1620s still stand today and are made out of interlocked granite boulders without mortar. Many of the stones were brought from rock quarries near the Seto Inland Sea and bear inscribed crests of the various families who contributed them. The shogunate also built a new elevated main tower, five stories on the outside and eight stories on the inside. Construction of the &quot;tenshu&quot; started in 1628 and was completed two years later, about the same time as the rest of the reconstruction, and followed the general layout of the original Toyotomi structure. However, it was built in a different part of the Honmaru (main bailey), as the base of the Toyotomi keep had actually been buried by the new Tokugawa version of the castle. After a long period of construction, the new Osaka Castle was completed in 1628.

In 1660, lightning ignited the gunpowder warehouse and the resulting explosion set the castle on fire. In 1665, lightning struck and burnt down the &quot;tenshu&quot;.

Kajisuke Nakama was one of the hatamoto guards that protected Osaka Castle. On 15 May 1740, when he was 25-year-old, he stole 4,000 ryō of gold inside. However, the crime was soon discovered by the shogunate, so he was arrested and confessed. Although he was a samurai, he was dragged around the city and sentenced to crucifixion in September. Later, this incident became a legend and the contents changed, so it is said that he was a thief who wanted the gold that Toyotomi Hideyoshi had dropped in the Kinmeisui Well.

In 1843, after decades of neglect, the castle got much-needed repairs when the bakufu collected money from the people of the region to rebuild several of the turrets.

In 1868, Osaka Castle fell and was surrendered to anti-bakufu imperial loyalists. A number of the castle buildings were burned in the civil conflicts surrounding the Meiji Restoration. The Honmaru Palace was lost during the Boshin War. In its place the &quot;Kishū Palace&quot; (紀州御殿 &quot;Kishū Goten&quot;) was moved here from Wakayama Castle to serve as an imperial state guest house, named later &quot;Tenrinkaku&quot;.

Under the Meiji government, Osaka Castle became part of the Osaka Army Arsenal (&quot;Osaka Hohei Kosho&quot;) manufacturing guns, ammunition, and explosives for Japan&#x27;s rapidly expanding Western-style military.

In 1931, the ferroconcrete &quot;tenshu&quot; was built.

During World War II, the arsenal became one of the largest military armories, employing 60,000 workers. American bombing raids targeting the arsenal damaged the reconstructed main keep and, on August 14, 1945, destroyed 90% of the arsenal and killed 382 people working there.

In 1995, Osaka&#x27;s government approved yet another restoration project, with the intent of restoring the main keep to its Edo-era splendor. In 1997, restoration was completed. The keep is a concrete reproduction (including elevators) of the original and the interior is intended as a modern, functioning museum.

Located in the Nishinomaru was the former residence of the &quot;jōdai&quot;, who were officials. The residence was the second largest after the Honmaru Palace. 
North of it were a number of warehouses. The site is now a park. Next to it is the Osaka State Guest House and the Hōshō-an &quot;chashitsu&quot;.

==Access==
The castle is open to the public and is easily accessible from Osakajōkōen Station on the JR West Osaka Loop Line. It is a popular spot during festival seasons, and especially during the cherry blossom bloom (hanami), when the sprawling castle grounds are covered with food vendors and taiko drummers. The large indoor arena, Osaka-jō Hall, also is located within the grounds of the castle park.
