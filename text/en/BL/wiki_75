<doc id="407118" wikidata="Q2993450" url="?curid=407118" title="List of political parties in Brazil">
<text>Brazil has a multi-party system since 1979, when the country&#x27;s military dictatorship disbanded an enforced two-party system and allowed the creation of multiple parties.

Above the broad range of political parties in Brazilian Congress, the Workers&#x27; Party (PT), the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), the Liberal Party (PL), the Progressives (PP) and the Brazil Union (UNIÃO) together control the absolute majority of seats in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. Smaller parties often make alliances with at least one of these five major parties. The number of political parties reached the apex of 35 on 2018, 30 of which were represented in congress after the 2018 general election. However, an electoral threshold introduced on 2017 has resulted in the culling and merger of many parties, as it cuts access to party subsidies and free party political broadcasts.

Brazilian parties have access to party subsidies in form of the &quot;Fundo Partidário&quot; () and the &quot;Fundo Eleitoral&quot; () for elections. And a system of free party political broadcasts during election time known as the &quot;horário eleitoral gratuito&quot;.
Since 1982, Brazilian political parties have been given an electoral number to make it easier for illiterate people to vote. Initially, it was a one-digit number: 1 for PDS, 2 for PDT, 3 for PT, 4 for PTB, and 5 for PMDB. When it became clear that there was going to be more than nine parties, two-digit numbers were assigned, with the first five parties having a &quot;1&quot; added to their former one-digit number (PDS becoming number 11, PDT 12, PT 13, PTB 14, and PMDB 15). Political parties often change their names, but they can retain their number.

In terms of association, parties can form electoral coalitions and party federations. Since 2017, coalitions are only allowed in elections under the majority system. Therefore, political parties can unite in support for a presidential or senatorial candidate, for example. However, parties cannot form coalitions for the election of federal deputies, state deputies and councillors. Coalitions are formed before the elections and do not oblige parties to remain together afterwards. Party federations, on the other hand, are legally different from coalitions in that they are longer-lasting, have a national scope and require ideological unity. Unlike coalitions, the parties that make up a federation are treated as a single party in legislative activity and in elections; they are prohibited from acting independently in the legislative houses or from filing election-related lawsuits, as the federation has the sole legal standing to do so.

<doc id="407127" wikidata="Q186350" url="?curid=407127" title="God the Father">
<text>God the Father is a title given to God in Christianity. In mainstream trinitarian Christianity, God the Father is regarded as the first Person of the Trinity, followed by the second person, Jesus Christ the Son, and the third person, God the Holy Spirit. Since the second century, Christian creeds included affirmation of belief in &quot;God the Father (Almighty)&quot;, primarily in his capacity as &quot;Father and creator of the universe&quot;.

Christians take the concept of God as the father of Jesus Christ metaphysically further than the concept of God as the creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostles&#x27; Creed where the expression of belief in the &quot;Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth&quot; is immediately, but separately followed by in &quot;Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord&quot;, thus expressing both senses of fatherhood.

== Christianity ==


===Overview===
In much of modern Christianity, God is addressed as the Father, in part because of his active interest in human affairs on the earth, in the way that a father would take an interest in his children who are dependent on him and as a father, he will respond to humanity, his children, acting in their best interests. Many believe they can communicate with God and come closer to him through prayer – a key element of achieving communion with God.

In general, the title &quot;Father&quot; (capitalized) signifies God&#x27;s role as the life-giver, the authority, and powerful protector, often viewed as immense, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent with infinite power and charity that goes beyond human understanding. For instance, after completing his monumental work &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, Catholic St. Thomas Aquinas concluded that he had not yet begun to understand &quot;God the Father&quot;. 

Although the term &quot;Father&quot; implies masculine characteristics, God is usually defined as having the form of a spirit without any human biological gender, e.g. the Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 239 specifically states that &quot;God is neither man nor woman: he is God&quot;. Although God is never directly addressed as &quot;Mother&quot;, at times motherly attributes may be interpreted in Old Testament references such as a hymn of praise 
, or .

In the New Testament, the Christian concept of God the Father may be seen as a continuation of the Jewish concept, but with specific additions and changes, which over time made the Christian concept become even more distinct by the start of the Middle Ages. The conformity to the Old Testament concepts is shown in and where in response to temptation Jesus quotes and states: &quot;It is written, you shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.&quot; shows the distinct Christian teaching about the &quot;agency of Christ&quot; by first stating: &quot;there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him&quot; and immediately continuing with &quot;and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.&quot; This passage clearly acknowledges the Jewish teachings on the uniqueness of God, yet also states the role of Jesus as an agent in creation. Over time, the Christian doctrine began to fully diverge from Judaism through the teachings of the Church Fathers in the second century and by the fourth century belief in the Trinity was formalized.
According to Mary Rose D&#x27;Angelo and James Barr, the Aramaic term &quot;Abba&quot; was in the early times of the New Testament neither markedly a term of endearment, nor a formal word; but the word normally used by sons and daughters, throughout their lives, in the family context.

=== Old Testament ===

According to Marianne Thompson, in the Old Testament, God is called &quot;Father&quot; with a unique sense of familiarity. In addition to the sense in which God is &quot;Father&quot; to all men because he created the world (and in that sense &quot;fathered&quot; the world), the same God is also uniquely the law-giver to his chosen people. He maintains a special, covenantal father–child relationship with the people, giving them the Shabbat, stewardship of his prophecies, and a unique heritage in the things of God, calling Israel &#x27;my son&#x27; because he delivered the descendants of Jacob out of slavery in Egypt according to his covenants and oaths to their fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. In the Hebrew Bible, Isaiah 63:16 (JP) reads: &quot;For You are our father, for Abraham did not know us, neither did Israel recognize us; You, O [YHWH], are our father; our redeemer of old is your name.&quot; To God, according to Judaism, is attributed the fatherly role of protector. He is titled the Father of the poor, of the orphan and the widow, their guarantor of justice. He is also titled the Father of the king, as the teacher and helper over the judge of Israel.

According to Alon Goshen-Gottstein, in the Old Testament &quot;Father&quot; is generally a metaphor; it is not a proper name for God but rather one of many titles by which Jews speak of and to God. According to Mark Sameth, references to God the Father convulsing in labor, giving birth, and suckling (Deuteronomy 32:13, 18) hint to a priestly belief, noted in the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries by Guillaume Postel and Michelangelo Lanci respectively, that “God the Father” is a dual-gendered deity. In Christianity fatherhood is taken in a more literal and substantive sense, and is explicit about the need for the Son as a means of accessing the Father, making for a more metaphysical rather than metaphorical interpretation.

=== New Testament ===

There is a deep sense in which Christians believe that they are made participants in the eternal relationship of Father and Son, through Jesus Christ. Christians call themselves &quot;adopted&quot; children of God:
In Christianity the concept of God as the Father of Jesus is distinct from the concept of God as the creator and Father of all people, as indicated in the Apostles&#x27; Creed. The profession in the creed begins with expressing belief in the &quot;Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth&quot; and then immediately, but separately, in &quot;Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord&quot;, thus expressing both senses of fatherhood within the creed.

=== History ===

Since the second century, creeds in the Western Church have included affirmation of belief in &quot;God the Father (Almighty)&quot;, the primary reference being to &quot;God in his capacity as Father and creator of the universe&quot;. This did not exclude either the fact the &quot;eternal father of the universe was also the Father of Jesus the Christ&quot; or that he had even &quot;vouchsafed to adopt [the believer] as his son by grace&quot;.

Creeds in the Eastern Church (known to have come from a later date) began with an affirmation of faith in &quot;one God&quot; and almost always expanded this by adding &quot;the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible&quot; or words to that effect.

By the end of the first century, Clement of Rome had repeatedly referred to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and linked the Father to creation, stating: &quot;let us look steadfastly to the Father and Creator of the universe&quot;. Around AD 213 in &quot;Adversus Praxeas&quot; () Tertullian is believed to have provided a formal representation of the concept of the Trinity, i.e. that God exists as one &quot;substance&quot; but three &#x27;Persons&#x27;: The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and with God the Father being the Head. Tertullian also discussed how the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. While the expression &quot;from the Father through the Son&quot; is also found among them.

The Nicene Creed, which dates to 325, states that the Son (Jesus Christ) is &quot;born of the Father before all ages&quot;, indicating that their &quot;divine&quot; Father-Son relationship is seen as not tied to an event within time or human history.

=== Trinitarian === 

To Trinitarian Christians (which include Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglicans, and most but not all Protestant denominations), God the Father is not a separate God from God the Son (of whom Jesus is the incarnation) and the Holy Spirit, the other hypostases of the Christian Godhead. In Eastern Orthodox theology, God the Father is the &quot;arche&quot; or &quot;principium&quot; (&quot;beginning&quot;), the &quot;source&quot; or &quot;origin&quot; of both the Son and the Holy Spirit, and is considered the eternal source of the Godhead. The Father is the one who eternally begets the Son, and the Father through the Son eternally breathes the Holy Spirit.

As a member of the Trinity, God the Father is one with, co-equal to, co-eternal, and consubstantial with the Son and the Holy Spirit, each Person being the one eternal God and in no way separated: all alike are uncreated and omnipotent. Because of this, the Trinity is beyond reason and can only be known by revelation.

The Trinitarian concept of God the Father is not pantheistic in that he is not viewed as identical to the universe or a vague notion that persists in it, but exists fully outside of creation, as its creator. He is viewed as a loving and caring God, a Heavenly Father who is active both in the world and in people&#x27;s lives. He created all things visible and invisible in love and wisdom, and created man for his own sake.

The emergence of Trinitarian theology of God the Father in early Christianity was based on two key ideas: first the shared identity of the Yahweh of the Old Testament and the God of Jesus in the New Testament, and then the self-distinction and yet the unity between Jesus and his Father. An example of the unity of Son and Father is : &quot;No one knows the Son except the Father and no one knows the Father except the Son&quot;, asserting the mutual knowledge of Father and Son.

The concept of fatherhood of God does appear in the Old Testament, but is not a major theme. While the view of God as the Father is used in the Old Testament, it only became a focus in the New Testament, as Jesus frequently referred to it. This is manifested in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer which combines the earthly needs of daily bread with the reciprocal concept of forgiveness. And Jesus&#x27; emphasis on his special relationship with the Father highlights the importance of the distinct yet unified natures of Jesus and the Father, building to the unity of Father and Son in the Trinity.

The paternal view of God as the Father extends beyond Jesus to his disciples, and the entire Church, as reflected in the petitions Jesus submitted to the Father for his followers at the end of the &quot;Farewell Discourse&quot;, the night before his crucifixion. Instances of this in the Farewell Discourse are as Jesus addresses the disciples: &quot;I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you&quot; and in as he prays to the Father: &quot;I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one.&quot;

=== Nontrinitarian ===
A number of Christian groups and communities reject the doctrine of a co-equal Trinity, and generally teach that God the Father is supreme, but nontrinitarian Christian groups differ somewhat from one another in their views regarding God the Father and Christ the Son.

In Mormonism, including its largest denomination the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the most prominent conception of &quot;the Godhead&quot; is as a divine council of three distinct beings: the Father (who is also referred to as Elohim), the Son Jesus (who is identified with Jehovah of the Old Testament), and the Holy Spirit. The Father and Son are considered to have perfected, physical bodies, while the Holy Spirit has a body of spirit. LDS Church members believe God the Father presides over both the Son and Holy Spirit, where God the Father is greater than both, but they are one in the sense that they have a unity of purpose. Most denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement also believe God (often referred to as Heavenly Father) has at least one spouse referred to as Heavenly Mother, and together they are called Heavenly Parents.

The Assemblies of Yahweh are nontrinitarian, believing that the Father is greater than the Son in all things, and that the Holy Spirit is not equal to the Father, and is not an actual person, but is God&#x27;s &quot;power&quot; or &quot;character&quot; in action. They refer to God the Father as &quot;Yahweh&quot;. The Yahweh Assemblies and other Sacred Name groups generally teach that Christ the Son was God&#x27;s first and prime creation, and was used to create everything else. They believe that the Messiah, whom they call &quot;Yahshua&quot; or &quot;Yeshua&quot; or &quot;Yehoshua&quot;, died for man&#x27;s sins, and is to be honored as the Anointed Lord, but that God the Father (Yahweh) is the True God that all &quot;true worshippers&quot; ultimately serve and worship. They teach that the Father is the only eternal one.

In Jehovah&#x27;s Witness theology, only God the Father (Jehovah) is the one true almighty God, even over his Son Jesus Christ. They teach that the Logos is God&#x27;s Only-begotten Son, and that the Holy Spirit is God&#x27;s active force (projected energy). They believe that the Father and the Son are united in divine purpose, administration, legislation, and man&#x27;s salvation, but are not one being and are not equal in power. While the Witnesses acknowledge Jesus’ pre-existence, perfection, and unique &quot;Sonship&quot; from God the Father, and believe that the Logos had an essential role in creation and redemption, and is the Messiah, they believe that only the Father is without beginning. They say that the Son was the Father&#x27;s only direct creation, before all ages. While both Persons are highly honored, taught, and preached, in their interpretations of and , God the Father is emphasized in Jehovah&#x27;s Witness meetings and services more than Christ the Son, as they teach that the Father is greater than the Son.

Oneness Pentecostalism teaches that God is a singular spirit who is one person, not three divine persons, individuals or minds. God the Father is the title of the supreme creator. The titles of the Son and Holy Spirit are merely titles reflecting the different personal manifestations of the One True God the Father in the universe.

== Other religions ==

Although similarities exist among religions, the common language and the shared concepts about God and his title &quot;Father&quot; among the Abrahamic religions is quite limited, and each religion has very specific belief structures and religious nomenclature with respect to the subject. While a religious teacher in one faith may be able to explain the concepts to his own audience with ease, significant barriers remain in communicating those concepts across religious boundaries.

=== Greco-Romanism ===
Greco-Roman pagans believed in an original triad. Over time, the names and gods of the triad were changed—except for Jupiter, which means &quot;Father Jove&quot; and comes from Proto-Italic &quot;Djous Patēr&quot;, from &quot;Djous&quot; (“day, sky”) + &quot;Patēr&quot; (“father”), from Proto-Indo-European &quot;Dyḗws&quot; (literally “the bright one”), root nomen agentis from &quot;Dyew&quot;- (“to be bright, day sky”), and &quot;Ph₂tḗr&quot; (“father”).

=== God Worshipping Society ===

A syncretic sect created by Hong Xiuquan, founder of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, that mixed Protestantism and Chinese folk religion, the objective of this sect was to overthrow the Manchus and restore power to the Han. God consisted of a triad made up of Shangdi (the Supreme Emperor in ancient Chinese worship), Christ as the eldest son and Hong as the youngest son.

=== Hinduism ===

In Hinduism, Bhagavan Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, chapter 9, verse 17, stated: &quot;I am the Father of this world, the Mother, the Dispenser and the Grandfather&quot;, one commentator adding: &quot;God being the source of the universe and the beings in it, He is held as the Father, the Mother and the Grandfather&quot;. A genderless Brahman is also considered the creator and Life-giver, and the Shakta goddess is viewed as the divine mother and life-bearer.

=== Islam ===

Unlike in Judaism, the term &quot;father&quot; is not formally applied to God by Muslims, and the Christian notion of the Trinity is rejected in Islam. Even though traditional Islamic teaching does not formally prohibit using the term &quot;Father&quot; in reference to God, it does not propagate or encourage it. There are some narratives of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in which he compares the mercy of God toward his worshipers to that of a mother to her infant child.

Islamic teaching rejects the Christian father-son relationship of God and Jesus, and states that Jesus is a prophet of God, not the Son of God. Islamic theology strictly reiterates the Absolute Oneness of God, and totally separates him from other beings (whether humans, angel or any other holy figure), and rejects any form of dualism or Trinitarianism. Chapter 112 of the Quran states:
=== Judaism ===
In Judaism, the use of the &quot;Father&quot; title is generally a metaphor, referring to the role as Life-giver and Law-giver, and is one of many titles by which Jews speak of and to God. The Jewish concept of God is that God is non-corporeal, transcendent and immanent, the ultimate source of love, and a metaphorical &quot;Father&quot;.

The Aramaic term for father (, &quot;abba&quot;) appears in traditional Jewish liturgy and Jewish prayers to God (e.g. in the Kaddish).

According to Ariela Pelaia, in a prayer of Rosh Hashanah, Areshet Sfateinu, an ambivalent attitude toward God is demonstrated, due to his role as a father and as a king. Free translation of the relevant sentence may be: &quot;today every creature is judged, either as sons or as slaves. If as sons, forgive us like a father forgives his son. If as slaves, we wait, hoping for good, until the verdict, your holy majesty.&quot; Another famous prayer emphasizing this dichotomy is called Avinu Malkeinu, which means &quot;Our Father Our King&quot; in Hebrew. Usually the entire congregation will sing the last verse of this prayer in unison, which says: &quot;Our Father, our King, answer us as though we have no deed to plead our cause, save us with mercy and loving-kindness.&quot;

=== Sikhism ===

The Guru Granth consistently refers to the creator as &quot;He&quot; and &quot;Father&quot;. This is because the Granth is written in north Indian Indo-Aryan languages (mixture of Punjabi and dialects of Hindi) which have no neutral gender. Since the Granth says that the God is indescribable, God has no gender according to Sikhism.

God in the Sikh scriptures has been referred to by several names, picked from Indian and Semitic traditions. He is called in terms of human relations as father, mother, brother, relation, friend, lover, beloved, husband. Other names, expressive of his supremacy, are &quot;thakur&quot;, &quot;prabhu&quot;, &quot;svami&quot;, &quot;sah&quot;, &quot;patsah&quot;, &quot;sahib&quot;, &quot;sain&quot; (Lord, Master).

== In Western art ==

For about a thousand years, no attempt was made to portray God the Father in human form, because early Christians believed that the words of Exodus 33:20 &quot;Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see Me and live&quot; and of the Gospel of John 1:18: &quot;No man hath seen God at any time&quot; were meant to apply not only to the Father, but to all attempts at the depiction of the Father. Typically only a small part of the body of Father would be represented, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely the whole person, and in many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.

In the early medieval period God was often represented by Christ as the &quot;Logos&quot;, which continued to be very common even after the separate figure of God the Father appeared. Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for the depiction of the Father in human form gradually emerged around the tenth century AD.
By the twelfth century depictions of a figure of God the Father, essentially based on the Ancient of Days in the Book of Daniel had started to appear in French manuscripts and in stained glass church windows in England. In the 14th century the illustrated Naples Bible had a depiction of God the Father in the Burning bush. By the 15th century, the Rohan Book of Hours included depictions of God the Father in human form or anthropomorphic imagery. Though the depiction remains rare and often controversial in Eastern Orthodox art, by the time of the Renaissance artistic representations of God the Father were freely used in the Western Church.

<doc id="407137" wikidata="Q1976619" url="?curid=407137" title="Robert Rich (musician)">
<text>Robert Rich (born August 23, 1963) is an ambient musician and composer based in California, United States. With a discography spanning over 40 years, he has been called a figure whose sound has greatly influenced today&#x27;s ambient music, New-age music, and even IDM.

==Biography==

===1980s: Sleep concerts and Early Career===
When Rich was a freshman at Stanford University in the 1980s, he gave free sleep concerts from the lounge of his dormitory. After positive results, he began performing around the San Francisco Bay Area. These performances were experiments to influence REM cycle sleep with auditory stimulus. They were usually nine hours long and lasted from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. During these performances, he would generate abstract drones and atmospheres while the audience dozed in sleeping bags that they brought themselves. In the morning, he ended the concert with piano solos and served tea.

During this time, he released four albums on cassette: &quot;Sunyata&quot; (1982), &quot;Trances&quot; (1983), &quot;Drones&quot; (1983), and his first live album titled Live (1984). He recorded the first album when he was 18 years old.

At Stanford, Rich earned his degree in psychology, studying sleep and consciousness with Stephen LaBerge, an expert in lucid dreaming. Rich cites dreams as inspirations for his compositional process.

Rich applied to study at Stanford’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. He organized a meeting with John Chowning, the founder of the class and inventor of FM synthesis. When Chowning saw Rich’s first three albums, he was approved for the class.

In 1983, he and Rick Davies together with a bassist named Andrew McGowan, formed a group called &quot;Urdu&quot;. They performed several live concerts in the San Francisco Bay area between 1983-1985. Some of the group&#x27;s recorded material was released as a self-titled cassette in 1985.

In 1985, Rich recorded an album titled &quot;Numena,&quot; which was released two years later. He composed it upon request from a Swedish music label started by one of his fans&quot;.&quot; This album marked the beginning of a new sound for Rich; it was his first album to explore complex rhythmic patterns, a wider range of acoustic instrumentation, and just intonation.

Rich recorded &quot;Geometry&quot; between 1986-1987, which was released in 1991. Rich was inspired by the symmetry and unity in Islamic patterns. Rich refers to this abstract and symmetrical sound as &quot;shimmer.&quot; Another contrasting style present in this album Rich calls &quot;glurp,&quot; which represents organic, liquid, and subterranean sounds.

Rich&#x27;s best-selling CD was &quot;Rainforest&quot; (1989), which sold 50,000 copies.

===1990s–2000s===
In the years that followed, he developed a complex range of sounds founded upon the seamless integration of electronic, electric, and acoustic instrumentation, and the exploration of just intonation tuning.

His interest in using unique sounds inspired him to create a large collection of original field recordings and homemade instruments. One of these instruments is a range of flutes made from PVC pipe.

His interest in unique sounds has also given him work as a sound designer for synthesizer presets and for E-mu Systems’ Proteus 3 and Morpheus sound modules. He has also designed sounds for films including &quot;Pitch Black&quot; and &quot;Behind Enemy Lines,&quot; a series of sampling discs called &quot;Things that Go Bump in the Night&quot;, and a library of Acid Loops called &quot;Liquid Planet&quot;. He helped create the MIDI micro-tuning standard along with Carter Scholz, which divides the octave into 196,608 equal parts.

His collaborators over the years have included Steve Roach, Brian &quot;Lustmord&quot; Williams, Lisa Moskow, Alio Die, and Ian Boddy, among others.

In 1992, he formed a new group called Amoeba. The group released three albums featuring ex-Urdu members Rick Davies and Andrew McGowan at different times, including &quot;Eye Catching&quot; (1993), &quot;Watchful&quot; (1997), and &quot;Pivot&quot; (2000). Since Rich was the only member in common between the first and second album, though, he doesn&#x27;t consider &quot;Eye Catching&quot; to represent the band. Amoeba features Rich on vocals, and is inspired by a tradition of introspective songwriting.

In 1995, Rich revived the sleep concerts for radio after a DJ from KUCI in Irvine CA suggested the idea to him. In 1996, he did a three month tour across the U.S. playing sleep concerts for studio and live audiences.

In 2001, he released an album titled &quot;Somnium&quot;, a 7-hour album divided into three tracks on one DVD video. This album was a recreation of the sleep-concert environment he had created during the 1980s at Stanford. Somnium represents a landmark in ambient music, being one of the longest continuous musical compositions ever released.

In 2004, he released an album of piano solos titled &quot;Open Window&quot;. This album documents his improvised piano style that has been part of his live concerts for decades. It was recorded on a 1925 vintage A.B. Chase baby grand piano.

On March 11, 2005, Rich suffered a hand injury while cleaning a glass jug, accidentally slipping and falling on top of it. During the recovery process, he continued to record new material and tour. He also constructed end-blown flutes from PVC pipe that are more easily played with his limited right-hand dexterity.

During his 2006 tour, Rich performed in front of a film created by visual artist Daniel Colvin as a backdrop. After the tour, he created a score for the film, which was released on CD and DVD in 2007 under the title &quot;Atlas Dei&quot;. In 2007, he also released the album &quot;Illumination&quot;, a companion soundtrack of a multimedia installation by Michael Somoroff, originally created for the Rothko chapel. He collaborated with touch guitarist Markus Reuter in the album &quot;Eleven Questions&quot; (2007).

<doc id="407138" wikidata="Q725991" url="?curid=407138" title="Csárdás">
<text>Csárdás (, ; ), often seen as Czárdás, is a traditional Hungarian folk dance, the name derived from &quot;&quot; (old Hungarian term for roadside tavern and restaurant). It originated in Hungary and was popularized by bands in Hungary as well as neighboring countries and regions such as of Slovenia, Burgenland, Croatia, Transylvania, Slovakia, Vojvodina and Moravia, as well as among the Banat Bulgarians, including those in Bulgaria.

== History ==

The origin of the csárdás was a death dance, when the soldier fought with his opponent, watched him, watched his weak points, then as a victor killed him and danced in joy with the others.

So the origin of the csárdás can be traced back to the Turkish wars.

The csárdás is characterized by a variation in tempo: it starts out slowly (&quot;lassú&quot;) and ends in a very fast tempo (&quot;friss&quot;, literally &quot;fresh&quot;). There are other tempo variations, called &quot;ritka csárdás&quot;, &quot;sűrű csárdás&quot; and &quot;szökős csárdás&quot;. The music is in or time. The dancers are both male and female, with the women dressed in traditional wide skirts, which form a distinctive shape when they whirl.
Classical composers who have used csárdás themes in their works include Emmerich Kálmán, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms, Léo Delibes, Johann Strauss, Pablo de Sarasate, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Franz von Suppé, Vittorio Monti, and others. The csárdás from Strauss&#x27; operetta &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;, sung by the character Rosalinde, is probably the most famous example of this dance in vocal music. One of the best-known examples of instrumental csárdás is the composition by Vittorio Monti for violin and piano. This virtuoso piece has seven tempo variations.

The original folk csárdás, as opposed to the later international variants, is enjoying a revival in Hungary thanks to the táncház movement.

<doc id="407139" wikidata="Q211204" url="?curid=407139" title="Carlos Sainz Sr.">
<text>Carlos Sainz Cenamor (born 12 April 1962) is a Spanish rally driver. He won the World Rally Championship drivers&#x27; title with Toyota in and , and finished runner-up four times. Constructors&#x27; world champions to have benefited from Sainz are Subaru (), Toyota () and Citroën (, and ). In the 2018 season, he was one of the official drivers of the Team Peugeot Total. He received the Princess of Asturias Sports Award in 2020. Sainz founded the Acciona | Sainz XE Team to join Extreme E and competed in the first two seasons alongside Laia Sanz.

Nicknamed &quot;El Matador&quot;, Sainz previously held the WRC record for most career starts until Finnish co-driver Miikka Anttila broke the record. He was also the first non-Nordic driver to win the 1000 Lakes Rally in Finland. He came close to repeating the feat at the Swedish Rally, finishing second four times and third twice. Alongside his WRC successes, he has won the Dakar Rally (2010, 2018, 2020, 2024), the Race of Champions (1997) and the Asia-Pacific Rally Championship (1990). His co-drivers were Antonio Boto, Luis Moya, Marc Martí, and Lucas Cruz.

== Personal life ==
His son, Carlos Sainz Jr., is also a professional racing driver, who most recently signed a contract to race for Williams Racing in Formula One for the 2025 season. He also has an older brother named Antonio Sainz, born on 10 December 1957, who was also a rally driver.

==Early life==
Sainz was born in Madrid. Before moving into motorsport, he played football and squash. As a teenager, Real Madrid gave him a trial and in squash he was the Spanish champion at the age of 16. He got his first touch of motorsport in Formula Ford while still playing squash and football. Before dedicating himself to motorsport, Sainz studied law up to the second scheduled cycle.

==Rallying career==
===Early career (1980–1988)===
Sainz began rallying in 1980. He finished runner-up in the Spanish Rally Championship in 1986, in a Group B Renault 5 Turbo, and won it with a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth in 1987 and 1988.

Ford gave him his first World Rally championship appearances during the 1987 season. He finished seventh in the Tour de Corse and eighth on the RAC Rally. He remained with Ford for the following season, now co-driven by Luis Moya, who remained his regular co-driver for the next fifteen years. He finished fifth twice, in the Tour de Corse and the Rallye Sanremo, and seventh on an icy RAC Rally.

Ford were an increasingly minor player in the World Rally Championship, with the rear-wheel-drive Sierra uncompetitive against the four-wheel-drive cars, and struggled to retain ambitious and talented young drivers such as Sainz and his teammate in 1988, Didier Auriol. Both departed the team for 1989; Auriol to Lancia and Sainz to Toyota Team Europe, the Japanese marque&#x27;s rallying arm operating in Cologne, Germany.

===Toyota (1989–1992)===

Despite all previous rallying Toyota Celicas having only ever looked a competitive prospect on highly specialized endurance rallies such as the Safari Rally, the new combination of Toyota and Sainz rapidly rose in competitiveness. In the 1989 season, Sainz started with four retirements but then finished on the podium in three rallies in a row. His teammate, by then two-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, also gave the Celica GT-Four ST165 its debut win at the inaugural Rally Australia. Sainz would almost certainly have won his first World Championship Rally on the final event of the season, the RAC Rally, but for mechanical failure in the final stages, which relegated him to second.

In the 1990 season, Sainz drove his GT-Four to victory at the Acropolis Rally, at the Rally New Zealand, at the 1000 Lakes Rally, as the first non-Nordic driver, and at the RAC Rally, claiming his first world drivers&#x27; title, ahead of Lancia&#x27;s Didier Auriol and Kankkunen, ending the Italian marque&#x27;s domination of the drivers&#x27; world championship since the advent of the Group A era of the sport in 1987.

In , Sainz narrowly failed to defend his title against a resurgent Lancia-mounted Kankkunen, his efforts capped by a dramatic roll of his Celica in Australia which left him in a neckbrace. Both Sainz and Kankkunen took five wins, the first time in the history of the WRC that two drivers had managed such a win tally during one season. Sainz led Kankkunen by one point going into the final round of the season, the RAC Rally, where Kankkunen took his third title by winning ahead of Kenneth Eriksson and Sainz. Kankkunen&#x27;s and Sainz&#x27;s point totals, 150 and 143, both broke the record set by Sainz a year earlier (140).

Aboard the new ST185 Toyota Celica in the 1992 season, in a year that would prove the last for the foreseeable future for Lancia, Sainz managed to score memorable victories on the Safari Rally and on his home asphalt round, the Rally Catalunya. The title fight again went down to the wire, and this time in a three-way battle; before the RAC, Sainz led Kankkunen by two points and Auriol, who had taken a record six wins during the season, by three points. Sainz&#x27;s victory ahead of Ari Vatanen and Kankkunen, combined with Auriol&#x27;s retirement, confirmed the title in favour of the Spaniard.

A limited number of 440 Celica GT-Four ST185s, carrying his name on a plaque in the vehicle, and with decals on the outside, were sold in the United Kingdom in 1992 in an attempt to capitalise on Sainz&#x27;s two championship successes with the works team. These were the part of the 5,000 units of ST185 for WRC homologation. It is said that Sainz still keeps a Celica GT-Four given to him by Toyota, which he drives to Real Madrid games at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

===Lancia (1993)===

Despite winning the world title Sainz left Toyota at the end of 1992, mainly because for the 1993 season the team was to be sponsored by Castrol, a rival to Sainz&#x27;s personal sponsor, Repsol. Sainz therefore moved to the private but Lancia-backed Jolly Club. Lancia had won the manufacturers&#x27; championship for the previous six years, but the Delta was an ageing design and technical developments during the season were minor, despite assurances given to Sainz that development would continue. The Delta lost ground to newer cars, and became less and less competitive as 1993 wore on. Sainz&#x27;s only podium finish was his second place at the Acropolis Rally. He finished second on the San Remo Rally, but he and his teammate were later disqualified for using illegal fuel. He finished eighth in the drivers&#x27; championship, which was won by Toyota driver Juha Kankkunen. Lancia withdrew from the sport altogether at the end of the season.

===Subaru (1994–1995)===
Sainz then chose to drive for the then fledgling Subaru World Rally Team in , where he replaced Ari Vatanen. Sainz&#x27;s experience, perfectionism and abilities as a development driver played a vital role in developing the then-new Impreza to the point where it could mount a sustained challenge to Toyota and Ford. Indeed, in the hands of Sainz and Colin McRae the Subarus were frequently faster than the Fords during the season. Toyota won the manufacturers&#x27; title, but the drivers&#x27; championship was only settled on the final round, with Didier Auriol winning ahead of Sainz. In the 1995 season, he won the Monte Carlo Rally, the Rally Portugal and the Rally Catalunya. At this latter event he was trailing his teammate Colin McRae until the team ordered the Scotsman to slow down and allow Sainz to win, which led to a dispute between the drivers. Nevertheless, they were tied for the lead in the drivers&#x27; world championship going into the season-ending RAC Rally. McRae won his home event 36 seconds ahead of Sainz, despite losing time with mechanical difficulties that at one stage had put him two minutes behind. Subaru secured their first manufacturers&#x27; title with a triple win as the team&#x27;s second young Briton, Richard Burns, finished third. Sainz was later to join McRae at both Ford and Citroën.

===Return to Ford (1996–1997)===

Sainz was supposed to return to Toyota for 1996 season, however the Toyota Team Europe was banned for the season following the cheating scandal surrounding the Celica&#x27;s turbo restrictor. Instead Sainz decided to join the factory Ford, bringing the Repsol sponsorship with him. He spent two seasons with the squad, aboard the Ford Escort RS Cosworth and later, the Escort World Rally Car. In 1996, he won the inaugural Rally Indonesia and with five other podium finishes to his name, he took third place in the drivers&#x27; world championship, behind Mitsubishi&#x27;s Tommi Mäkinen and Subaru&#x27;s McRae. In the 1997 season, he again won the Indonesian round, along with the Acropolis Rally, but again lost the title fight to Mäkinen and McRae. However, he won the Race of Champions at the end of 1997.

===Return to Toyota (1998–1999)===

Sainz then departed, once again, for Toyota, partnering Didier Auriol and helping to further the Corolla World Rally Car project that had been instituted in 1997, as part of the Cologne based team&#x27;s recovery from the embarrassment of exclusion from the world championship on the penultimate round of the 1995 season.

Sainz won on his first outing for them, on the 1998 season opener Monte Carlo Rally, and later in the season, added a victory in New Zealand. The seemingly terminal blow to title rival Tommi Mäkinen&#x27;s chances was his retirement on the first day of the final event of the year, the Rally Great Britain, which gave the initiative to Sainz, who now only had to finish fourth in order to ensure the title. However, just from the finish of the last stage, he too was forced to retire from the needed fourth place with a mechanical problem. As a result, both Sainz and Toyota gifted their respective titles to rivals Mäkinen and Mitsubishi Ralliart.
A subdued season followed for Sainz in 1999, although it did at least culminate in a departing manufacturers&#x27; title for Toyota, by now fostering alternative interests in Formula One. Sainz took a total of eight podiums, but no wins, and finished fifth in the drivers&#x27; standings, behind his third-placed teammate Auriol who had taken his only win of the season at the inaugural China Rally.

===Second return to Ford (2000–2002)===

This was the precursor of another, three-year stint with Ford, again alongside McRae, beginning with the 2000 season. He won the inaugural edition of the Cyprus round of the world championship, and finished third in the drivers&#x27; points standings.

Sainz failed to score a victory on any rally during the 2001 season, but with five podiums and four other point-scoring finishes, he managed to keep himself in the title fight throughout the very closely contested season, eventually finishing sixth in the standings, only eleven points adrift of the champion, Subaru&#x27;s Richard Burns. Meanwhile, teammate McRae took three wins and led the championship before the season-ending Rally GB, where McRae crashed out. Ford also lost the manufacturer&#x27;s title to Peugeot.

In , Sainz inherited the victory of the Rally Argentina, having provisionally finished third, due to the disqualifications of the two leading Peugeots of Marcus Grönholm and Burns. This was his only win of the season, and in a close fight for second place in the drivers&#x27; championship, behind the dominant Grönholm, Sainz finished third, one point ahead of his teammate McRae.

===Citroën (2003–2005)===

Effectively frozen out along with McRae at Ford, he along with the Scot moved to Citroën for the , during which he scored one win in Turkey – which was the first gravel event win for Citroën Xsara WRC – and finished third in the championship. Sainz continued with the team in the season, and scored his final world rally victory at the 2004 Rally Argentina. During the Rally Catalonia 2004, after announcing his retirement, Sainz was considered by drivers, codrivers and directors of the official teams, as the best rally driver of history. In the championship, Sainz finished fourth, after missing out the final rally in Australia, due an accident during pre-event recce.

Despite formally retiring at the end of the 2004 season, with a possible view to moving into the World Touring Car Championship, he was invited back to the WRC fold on the request of Citroën, to replace the faltering Belgian driver François Duval. Although Duval was soon to reclaim his seat, Sainz&#x27;s two rallies back in the Citroën impressed many, with the now 43-year-old Spaniard posting fourth and third finishing positions respectively.

===Later career in rally raid===
In 2006, Sainz was at the wheel of a Volkswagen in that year&#x27;s Dakar Rally, sharing the cockpit with the two times winner of the Dakar Rally, Andreas Schulz. In 2007, he repeated his attempt with Volkswagen, this time with French Michel Perin, also a former winner of the raid. Following the resignation of Fernando Martin, he even ran, eventually in vain, for the vice-president position at his beloved football club Real Madrid, for which he once trained. In 2007 Sainz won the FIA Cross-Country Rally World Cup with the Volkswagen team. In 2008, he won the Central Europe Rally, which was the relocated and rescheduled Dakar Rally for that year because of a terrorist attack. In January 2009, partnering again with Perin, he led the Dakar Rally until crashing out on the 12th stage. Later in 2009 Sainz won Silk Way Rally with Volkswagen team. At the 2010 Dakar Rally, Sainz changed again co-pilot, teaming with fellow Spaniard Lucas Cruz. Sainz edged out teammate Nasser Al-Attiyah to take his maiden win in the event. In 2010 Sainz also won the Silk Way Rally for the second time. In the 2011 Dakar Rally, Sainz finished third.

Sainz entered Dakar Rally 2013 in a brand-new two-wheel-drive buggy. His teammate was former Dakar-winner Nasser Al-Attiyah and the team was supported by Qatar and Red Bull. Sainz won the first stage, but faced later various problems and was finally forced to retire on the sixth stage due to an engine failure. After the retirement Sainz commented that despite the result, &quot;it was worth coming here with this concept ... I hope the experience will be useful for the future even if I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;ll come back”. However, later Sainz announced he would like to be part of Qatar Red Bull Rally Team and return to the Dakar in 2014. Sainz took part in the 2014 Dakar, but was forced to retire after a crash on stage 10.

In March 2014 it was announced that Peugeot Sport would return to Dakar in 2015 and Sainz joined Cyril Despres to race for Peugeot, driving its Peugeot 2008 DKR. In the rally he retired after a crash. In Dakar 2016 Sainz was forced to retire from the lead after the gearbox of his Peugeot broke. In 2017 Sainz also had to retire after rolling his Peugeot during the fourth stage of the rally. In 2018, Sainz took the second Dakar win of his career with Peugeot team.

After Peugeot shut down its rally raid programme, Sainz joined X-Raid to drive a Mini at the 2019 Dakar Rally. He stuck the car in a large hole on stage 3, damaging the suspension, but limped to the end of the stage and finished the event 13th.

Sainz won his third Dakar Rally in 2020, with co-driver Lucas Cruz. The duo registered four stage wins to their name, before finally winning the race with a lead of just 6 minutes and 21 seconds.

Sainz returned to the Dakar Rally in 2021 with Mini, recording three stage victories on the way to an overall third-place finish.

After joining Audi in 2022, Sainz won his fourth Dakar Rally in 2024, becoming the oldest Dakar winner at age 61.

===Volkswagen&#x27;s WRC project===
As Volkswagen Motorsport announced its WRC entry for 2013, Sainz was announced to be part of the WRC project. Volkswagen&#x27;s motorsport director Kris Nissen told that he needed &quot;10 seconds&quot; to convince Sainz to remain part of the company&#x27;s efforts in the new programme. Nissen told that the team would need Sainz for some testing of the new car. In November 2011, Sainz had the honour to drive first kilometres with the new Volkswagen Polo R WRC near Trier, Germany, when the team began testing the new car. In late 2011, Nissen also revealed he would like to see Sainz taking part in some rally with the WRC Polo before he calls time on his career. In early 2012 Sainz drove the Polo WRC in its maiden gravel test in Spain with Sébastien Ogier and in summer he tested the Polo WRC in Finland. In October Sainz re-joined his old co-driver Luis Moya to perform course car duties on the San Marino´s annual Rally Legend event with Volkswagen&#x27;s new-for-2013 Polo R WRC. In December 2012 Sainz dismissed rumours he would drive a Polo WRC in some of the WRC-rallies in 2013, but stated he was available for testing, if needed.

Sainz returned to competing in 2012, as he entered a historic rally with his old co-driver Luis Moya in Spain. The pair competed in a Porsche 911 rally car and won the rally. The pair made a return to historic rallies in March 2013 by winning Rally de España Histórico with a Porsche 911.

== Sainz XE Team ==
In November 2020, it was announced that Sainz would team up with QEV Technologies to form Acciona | Sainz XE Team to join the all-electric SUV off-road racing series Extreme E in the inaugural season with Laia Sanz and himself as the drivers line-up. The team made its Extreme E debut at the 2021 Desert X-Prix and achieved a podium finish at the Arctic X-Prix. The team finished in sixth in the teams championship. The team maintained the drivers line-up for the 2022 season and achieved two podiums at the Desert and Copper X-Prixs. The team finished in third in the teams&#x27; championship.

The team again maintained the drivers line-up for the 2023 season. However, in January 2023, Sainz suffered multiple spinal fractures after crashing at the Dakar Rally and was replaced by Mattias Ekström for the season. The team started strongly at the Desert X-Prix – in Round 1, the team qualified the fastest, achieved a super sector and finished the race in second place. In Round 2, the team won their first race in Extreme E. The team won its second race in Round 7 at the Island X-Prix II. At the final two rounds of the season, the team finished in second and suffered a DNF respectively, losing the championship to RXR by 11 points.

For the 2024 season, Ekström moved to McLaren XE and was replaced by Fraser McConnell. On 6 September, a week before the scheduled Island X-Prix, Extreme E announced that the rounds in Sardinia and Phoenix were cancelled.

<doc id="407140" wikidata="Q1474340" url="?curid=407140" title="USS Ethan Allen (SSBN-608)">
<text>USS &quot;Ethan Allen&quot; (SSBN-608), lead ship of her class, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for American Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen.

&quot;Ethan Allen&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Corporation of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 22 November 1960, sponsored by Margaret Hitchcock (Sims) Hopkins, great-great-great-granddaughter of Ethan Allen and wife of Robert H. Hopkins. The ship was commissioned on 8 August 1961, with Captain Paul L. Lacy, Jr., commanding Blue Crew and Commander W. W. Behrens, Jr., commanding the Gold Crew.

&quot;Ethan Allen&quot; (Navy hull design SCB 180) was the first submarine designed as a ballistic missile launch platform. (The earlier were converted attack submarines.) She was constructed from HY80 steel (high yield, yield strength), and was fitted with the Mark 2 Mod 3 Ships Inertial Navigation System (SINS). At launch, she was outfitted with Polaris A-2 (UGM-27B) submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and Mark 16 Mod 6 torpedoes; the torpedo fire control system was the Mark 112 Mod 2. The A-2s would be replaced with Polaris A-3s and but maintained the high pressure air ejection launch gear throughout the rest of her career as a FBM. The fire control system was upgraded to the Mark 80 fire control systems during 1965, while in the 1970s these would be replaced with Polaris A-3Ts. In addition, &quot;Ethan Allen&quot; was updated with Mark 37 and (later) Mark 48 torpedoes during her operational lifetime.

On 6 May 1962, &quot;Ethan Allen&quot;, under Captain Lacy and with Admiral Levering Smith aboard, launched a nuclear-armed Polaris missile that detonated at over the South Pacific. That test (&quot;Frigate Bird&quot;), part of Operation Dominic, was the only complete operational test of an American strategic missile. The warhead was said to hit &quot;right in the pickle barrel&quot;. and participated in the test, about 30 miles from the impact point.

To make room for the new ballistic missile submarines within the limitations of SALT II, &quot;Ethan Allen&quot;″s missile tubes (and those of other and ballistic missile submarines) were disabled, and she was redesignated an attack submarine (hull number SSN-608) on 1 September 1980.

&quot;Ethan Allen&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 1983 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 April 1983. Her hulk was tied up in Bremerton, Washington, until entering the Nuclear Powered Ship-Submarine Recycling Program. Recycling was completed on 30 July 1999..

In Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (published 1984), the USS &quot;Ethan Allen&quot; is blown up as a decoy in order to convince the Russian Navy that the &quot;Red October&quot; has been destroyed. (This plotline doesn&#x27;t feature in the later film adaptation.)

<text>Gustave Jules René Coty (; 20 March 188222 November 1962) was President of France from 1954 to 1959. He was the second and last president of the Fourth French Republic.

==Early life and politics==
René Coty was born in Le Havre and studied at the University of Caen, where he graduated in 1902 with degrees in law and philosophy. He worked as a lawyer in his hometown of Le Havre, specialising in maritime and commercial law.
He also became involved in politics, as a member of the Radical Party, and in 1907 was elected as a district councillor. The following year, he was elected to the communal council of Le Havre as a member of the Republican Left group. He retained both of these positions until 1919. Coty also served as a member of the Conseil Général of Seine-Inférieure from 1913 to 1942, holding the post of vice president from 1932.

When the First World War broke out, Coty volunteered for the army, joining the 129th Infantry Regiment. He fought at the Battle of Verdun. He entered the Chamber of Deputies in 1923, succeeding Jules Siegfried as Deputy for Seine-Inférieure. However, by this stage of his political career, Coty had moved away from the Radical Party and sat as a member of the Republican Union. Between 13 and 23 December 1930 he served as Under-secretary of State for the Interior in the government of Théodore Steeg.

In 1936, Coty was elected to the Senate for Seine-Inférieure. He was one of the French parliamentarians who, on 10 July 1940, voted to give extraordinary powers to Philippe Pétain, thereby bringing about the Nazi-backed Vichy government. Coty remained relatively inactive during the Second World War, although he was rehabilitated after the war.

==Postwar life and presidency==
He was a member of the Constituent National Assembly from 1944 to 1946, and chaired the right-wing &quot;Independent Republican&quot; group, which later became part of the National Center of Independents and Peasants. Coty was elected to the National Assembly in 1946 as a Deputy for Seine-Inférieure, and from November 1947 to September 1948, he served as Minister for Reconstruction and Urban Planning in the governments of Robert Schuman and André Marie. Coty was elected as a member of the Council of the Republic in November 1948, and served as Vice President of the Council from 1952.

Coty stood as a candidate for president in 1953, although it was thought unlikely that he would be elected. Nonetheless, and despite twelve successive ballots, right-wing favourite Joseph Laniel failed to obtain the absolute majority required. Following the withdrawal of another key right-wing candidate, Louis Jacquinot, Coty was finally elected in the thirteenth ballot on 23 December 1953, winning 477 votes against the 329 of socialist Marcel-Edmond Naegelen. He succeeded Vincent Auriol as president on 16 January 1954.

As President of the Republic, Coty was even less active than his predecessor in trying to influence policy. His presidency was troubled by the political instability of the Fourth Republic and the Algerian question. With the deepening of the crisis in 1958, on 29 May of that year, President Coty appealed to Charles de Gaulle, the &quot;most illustrious of Frenchmen&quot; to become the last Prime Minister of the Fourth Republic. Coty had threatened to resign if de Gaulle&#x27;s appointment was not approved by the National Assembly.

De Gaulle drafted a new constitution, and on 28 September, a referendum took place in which 79.2% of those who voted supported the proposals, which led to the Fifth Republic. De Gaulle was elected as president of the new republic by parliament in December, and succeeded Coty on 9 January 1959. Coty was a member of the Constitutional Council from 1959 until his death in 1962.

==In popular culture==
A photo of President Coty is a running joke in the 2006 French spy spoof &quot;OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies&quot;.

* International Masters Games Association (IMGA)

== Relationship with the World Dance Council ==

The WDSF is not the only international organisation in the field of competitive dance: the World Dance Council (WDC) is another prominent international dance organisation.

In the past, the WDC focus was on administering professional dancers and competitions. However, the launch of the WDC Amateur League in 2007 put the two organisations in direct conflict. The launch of the IDSF Professional Division in 2010 has since become an additional point of conflict.

The WDSF formerly prohibited its members from participating in any competition that is not listed and registered by either WDSF or a WDSF National Member Body. WDC competitions fall into this prohibited category. This policy was revoked in 2012 at the Annual Meeting by vote of the members and since then WDSF encourages athletes to support only WDSF DanceSport and imposes certain restrictions on athletes who compete outside the WDSF DanceSport system.

Like the WDC, WDSF bans same-sex couples from entering competitions, under rule D2.1.1, which states a couple must consist of a man and a woman.

== Publications ==
&quot;The International News&quot; (Tanzsportmagazin), which served as WDSF&#x27;s official publication since 1998, was replaced in 2004 by &quot;DanceSport Today,&quot; and in 2009 by &quot;World DanceSport&quot; magazine.

<text>Dancesport is competitive ballroom dancing, as contrasted to social or exhibition dancing. In the case of Para dancesport, at least one of the dancers is in a wheelchair.

Dancesport events are sanctioned and regulated by dancesport organizations at the national and international level, such as the World DanceSport Federation.

The name was invented to help competitive ballroom dancing gain Olympic recognition. The physical demand of dancesport has been the subject of scientific research.

==History==
The first unofficial world championship took place in 1909, and the first formation team was presented in 1932 by Olive Ripman at the Astoria Ballroom, London. Dancesport was first broadcast on TV in 1960.

==Styles==
The term &quot;dancesport&quot; applies to the International Style as well the as American Style of competitive ballroom. It includes the following categories:
* International Standard
* International Latin 
* American Smooth
* American Rhythm

These categories apply to both individual couples and formation dance.

== International governing organizations ==

=== World Dance Council ===
The World Dance Council (WDC) is a registered limited company, and the legal successor to the International Council of Ballroom Dancing (ICBD), which was formed in 1950 in Edinburgh. The WDC operates through a general council and two committees:
* The World Dance Sport Committee regulates professional dancesport at the international level. 
* The World Social Dance Committee &quot;deals with all matters of the dance profession that relate to the activities of Dance Schools and Dance Teachers&quot;. It does not regulate social dance directly – that is the business of individual organisers, the dance teacher organisations, such as the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, and the chains of dance teaching schools in the United States.

In 2007 the WDC Amateur League was created. This organisation runs a number of competitions and has its own world ranking system for amateur dancers.

Each member country in the WDC has its own national organisation, such as the British Dance Council, which acts as a forum for the many interested parties in that country. The national bodies decide on their delegates to the WDC.

=== World DanceSport Federation ===
The World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), formerly the International DanceSport Federation (IDSF), is the international governing body of dancesport, as recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Founded in 1957 as the International Council of Amateur Dancers (ICAD), it took up the name International DanceSport Federation in 1990. In 2011 it changed its name to World DanceSport Federation to emphasise the organization&#x27;s global character.

In the past, the IDSF&#x27;s focus was on administering amateur dancers and competitions. However, in 2010 the IDSF Professional Division was created (formerly known as the IPDSC), which extended this focus to professional dancesport.

WDSF members are only allowed to dance in competitions that are on the WDSF&#x27;s official competition calendar, unless the member has obtained the WDSF&#x27;s written permission to compete in an event that is not on the WDSF&#x27;s calendar.

== Competitions ==

There are a wide variety of dance competitions. They range from the well known Blackpool Dance Festival, an event open to all, to competitions conducted exclusively for university students, such as those hosted by the Inter Varsity Dance Association in the UK.

Amateur competitions commonly include events that group dancers by age, experience, or both. For example, events might group young dancers by age, such as: juvenile (&lt;12yrs), junior (12-16yrs), and youth (16-19yrs). Events may sometimes cover a wide range of ages, with groupings such as: under 21yrs, adult, senior I (over 35yrs), senior II (over 45yrs), senior III (over 55yrs), and senior IV (over 65yrs).

Competitors may also be grouped by experience level, with categories such as Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Pre-Amateur and Amateur. These generally correspond to the number of the dances to be performed in the competition, with Beginners performing one dance, and those at Amateur level performing five. In some competitions these are categorized into grades from A to E, with &quot;A&quot; the equivalent of the Amateur level, and &quot;E&quot; corresponding to the &quot;Beginner&quot; level.

=== WDSF minimum competition dance area size standard ===
WDSF governing bodies in different countries have the flexibility to decide on the dance area size for competitions held in the country.

In December 2011, the WDSF Open and the Australian Nationals were held at the Hisense Arena located within the Olympic park in Melbourne. The floor was at 84 by 37.7 meters which was 7.61 times the size of what WDSF requires.

=== Rules ===
The World Dance Council (WDC) rules for international competitions are lengthy and detailed. The music for competitions is kept confidential until the event. The music always follows a strict tempo and, for a couples competition, it will have a duration of no less than 90 seconds, and no more than two minutes.

Some elementary competitions are restricted to &quot;basic&quot; steps, but international competitions are open as to choreography, within the limits of the traditional style of the individual dances. Only the Viennese waltz has defined choreography: it is limited to seven well-specified figures. Lifts are not permitted, except for Show Dance titles. The tempo for each dance is defined. In the finals, couples are marked under the skating system and judged by timing, footwork, rise and fall, alignment, direction and floor craft. Competitors must meet World Anti-Doping Agency rules.

===Dancesport as an Olympic event===
After a long campaign, the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), formerly IDSF, was recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the sole representative body for dancesport, on September 5, 1997. At that point, many dance organisations changed their titles to incorporate the word &quot;sport&quot;. This recognition gives the IDSF, potentially, a unique status. The WDSF website shows letters and certificates from the IOC that recognise dancesport as an eligible sport for inclusion pursuant to rule 29 of the Olympic Charter.
On its website, the IDSF gives an upbeat appraisal of the chances of dancesport being included in a future summer Olympic Games. However, dancesport has not been included as an official event at the Olympics since its recognition, and there are many who doubt that it ever will. The 2008 Beijing Olympics did not include ballroom dancing and neither did the 2012 London Olympics. However, it was announced in December 2016 that breakdancing would form part of the programme for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics under the &quot;dancesport&quot; label, with men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and mixed-team events included in a one-on-one battle format.

===Physical demands===

Over the years, competitive ballroom dancing has evolved so much in its choreography, requiring a higher level of athleticism. Many individuals that spectate or dance socially often underestimate the physical attributes and demands of dancesport competitive dancing . In order to compete at a world level, elite competitive dancers undergo rigorous training to help and enhance their competition performance. These dancers seem to perform at such a high level of energy expenditure that a deeper understanding of these energy demands may help build specific training programs used to sustain a high quality dance performance consistent over a few rounds of a competition.

In 1988, an Australian study was conducted to determine the heart rate and estimated energy expended during ballroom dancing. Professors Blanksby and Reidy of the Department of Human Movement and Recreation Studies at the University of Western had ten competitive ballroom dance couples simulate a dancesport competition, dancing their competitive routines in either the Latin American or Standard division. After administrating all required laboratory tests (in order to record their height, weight, body fat percentage, fat free mass and the resting/maximal heart rate and VO2 values), the couples danced a five-dance final, given a 15 to 20 second break between each dance. Throughout the final their heart rates were telemetered and recorded. The purpose of this study was to estimate the energy requirements from heart rates acquired during competition simulation and previously recorded measures of VO2 and HR.

The average heart rate for male dancers in Standard was 170 beats min−1 and 168 beats min−1 in the Latin American. Females elicited 179 beats min−1 and 177 beats min−1 respectively. Astrand and Rodahl (1977) classify any exercise being extremely heavy if it results in a heart rate above 150 beats min−1. They also classify an exercise as extremely heavy if oxygen consumption is higher than 2.0L min−1. All but the females in the Standard dance sequence did not exceed an oxygen consumption level of 2.0L min−1. Finally, the energy expenditure for male athletes was estimated to be 54.1 ± 8.1 kJ min−1 for Standard and 54.0± 9.6kJ min−1 in the Latin American dances. For females it was 34.7 ± 3.8 kJ min−1 and 36.1 ± 4.1 kJ min−1 respectively.

Two other similar experiments were conducted exhibiting very similar results and analyses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massidda, M. M., Cugusi L. C., Ibba M. I., Tradori l. t., Calò C, M, December 11, 2011 206&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/22211197&amp;rft.externalDocID=22211197&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In all three of the experiments, significant differences in the energy expenditure between the male and female athletes were noticed. Generally males had a higher energy expenditure than their female counterparts. This is evident due to the anthropometric differences between the two sexes and the oxygen transport capacity.

Comparing the mean gross energy expenditures (in kJ min−1) between ballroom dancing and other sports, it is evident that competitive dancing is equally as demanding in comparison to other sporting activities such as basketball (35.83 kJ min−1) or cross-country running (44.37kJ min−1) (Consolazioetal, 1963), and that competitive ballroom dancing requires a cardiovascular system that can work at a high energy level in order to match the given physiological strain.

== Para dancesport ==

Previously known as Wheelchair dancesport until it was rebranded in 2016, Para dancesport consists of couples can competing in two kinds of events: combi (one standing partner and one wheelchair partner) or duo (both dancers are in wheelchairs). Disciplines contested in Para dance sport are: standard, Latin, singles and freestyle. Disciplines in couples events are combi standard, combi Latin, combi freestyle, duo standard, duo Latin and duo freestyle. The Freestyle and singles disciplines were introduced in 2014. Both were contested for the first time at a World Championship in 2015 in Rome, Italy.

<text>Boris Vladimirovich Derjaguin (or Deryagin; ) (9 August 1902 in Moscow – 16 May 1994) was a Soviet and Russian chemist. He laid the foundation of the modern science of colloids and surfaces; an epoch in the development of the physical chemistry of colloids and surfaces is associated with his name. He was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences, 

Derjaguin became famous in scientific circles for his work on the stability of colloids and thin films of liquids which is now known as the DLVO theory, after the initials of its authors: Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek. It is universally included in text books on colloid chemistry and is still widely applied in modern studies of interparticle forces in colloids. In particular, the Derjaguin approximation is widely used in order to approximate the interaction between curved surfaces from a knowledge of the interaction for planar ones.

Derjaguin was also briefly involved in polywater research during the 1960s and early 1970s. This field claimed that if water was heated then cooled in quartz capillaries, it took on astonishing new properties. Eventually, the scientists who were involved in polywater admitted it did not exist, claiming they were misled by poorly designed experiments (Derjaguin rejected polywater in 1973).

He is also known for having hotly rejected some of the then-new ideas of adhesion as presented by the Western bloc in the 1970s. His model came to be known as the DMT (after Derjaguin, Muller and Toporov) model, while the model presented by Western bloc scientists came to be known as the JKR (after Johnson, Kendall and Roberts) model for adhesive elastic contact. This rejection proved to be instrumental in the development of the D. Tabor and later D. Maugis parameters that quantify which contact model (of the JKR and DMT models) represent adhesive contact better for specific materials.

In 1935, Derjaguin founded the Laboratory of Thin Layers at the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He was the head of the laboratory until 1988, when the age limit for directors of research divisions was introduced. He was replaced by Vladimir Muller as the head of the laboratory.

<doc id="407158" wikidata="Q1014066" url="?curid=407158" title="Callander">
<text>Callander (; ) is a small town in the council area of Stirling in Scotland, situated on the River Teith. The town is located in the historic county of Perthshire and is a popular tourist stop to and from the Highlands.
==Description==
The town serves as the eastern gateway to the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, the first National Park in Scotland, and is often referred to as the &quot;Gateway to the Highlands&quot;.

Dominating the town to the north are the Callander Crags, a visible part of the Highland Boundary Fault, rising to at the cairn.
Ben Ledi () lies north-west of Callander. Popular local walks include Bracklinn Falls, The Meadows, Callander Crags and the Wood Walks. The Rob Roy Way passes through Callander. The town sits on the Trossachs Bird of Prey Trail. The River Teith is formed from the confluence of two smaller rivers, the Garbh Uisge (River Leny) and Eas Gobhain about west of the bridge at Callander.

A 19th-century Gothic church stands in the town square, named after Saint Kessog, an Irish missionary who is said to have preached in the area in the sixth century. The church closed in 1985 and between 1990 and 2006 the building, after undergoing substantial interior alterations, was home to a visitor centre and audio-visual attraction telling the story of local outlaw, Rob Roy MacGregor. The church building was occupied by The Clanranald Trust for Scotland between 2015 and 2018, but it now lies empty.

Founded in 1892, McLaren High School educates pupils aged 11 to 18 from a wide catchment area extending as far as Killin, Tyndrum and Inversnaid.

In 2018 Callander was named Scotland&#x27;s First Social Enterprise Place, due to the amount of social enterprise activity within the town. This includes Callander Community Hydro Ltd., a community owned renewable energy project which distributes funds to a variety of local projects.

== Toponym ==
The name &quot;Callander&quot; was first recorded, perhaps erroneously, as &quot;Callander&quot; in 1238, and &quot;Kallandrech&quot; in 1438, and the etymology is uncertain. William J Watson had the derivation as Gaelic &quot;Calasraid&quot;, meaning &quot;harbour-street&quot; or &quot;ferry-street&quot; in 1913. By 1926, Watson stated &quot;Callander on Teith…is a transferred name from Callander near Falkirk&quot;, and indeed, it is probable that from at least the 16th century, &quot;Callander&quot; was influenced by that spelling. Early forms with &quot;Calen-&quot; may relate to the original name of the estate, which may have straddled the Teith. &quot;Calendrate&quot; may have been a subdivision of this estate, and the &quot;sraid&quot; element may relate to a Roman road. Some of the early forms contain &quot;–drate&quot;, which might be Gaelic &quot;drochaid&quot; &quot;bridge&quot;.

&quot;Calender&quot; may also be of Brittonic origin, and derived from &quot;*caleto-dubro-&quot; (Welsh &quot;caled-dŵr&quot;), meaning &quot;hard-water&quot;. The &quot;-n&quot; in the name &quot;Callander&quot; is intrusive. It may originally have been a river-name, perhaps that of the present River Teith. A name of the &quot;Calder&quot; type, Callander may share an etymology with the Callater Burn in Aberdeenshire, as well as the English names Calder in West Yorkshire, and Kielder in Northumberland.

== History ==
A neolithic settlement situated south of the river was excavated in 2001 finding evidence of a timber building in length along with neolithic pottery. The Auchenlaich Cairn, a neolithic chambered cairn which at in length is the longest in Britain, is situated near Keltie Bridge just east of Callander. The remains of an ancient hillfort can be seen at Dunmore overlooking Loch Venachar, near Kilmahog. This fort was likely a large defended structure visible from some distance and excavations have revealed a well and signs of vitrified stonework. Nearby, the remains of Roman ramparts constructed during the campaigns of Agricola in the first century AD are visible at Bochastle Farm.

Saint Kessog, a disciple of Columba of Iona, preached and taught in this area in the early sixth century. A small mound by the River Teith is named in pseudo-Gaelic as &quot;Tom na Chessaig&quot;, meaning &quot;the Hill of Kessog&quot;. This man-made mound is circular with a level top approximately in diameter. It is reputed to have been constructed as a memorial to the Saint or even to be the remains of Callander&#x27;s original church (situated close to the old graveyard). The structure has actually been identified as a medieval motte, although no excavation has confirmed this. Historians record that an annual market called &quot;Feill ma Chessaig&quot; (festival of Kessog) was held here until the early 19th century.

A medieval tower house, Callander Castle, once stood south of the river, which is said to have been &quot;a square tower of considerable height&quot;. This belonged to the Livingstons of Callendar House near Falkirk. The only remains of the castle are some masonry and a possible datestone inscribed 1596, which is now incorporated within the old St Kessog&#x27;s Manse on the same site.

In 1645, during the campaigns of Montrose, a battle was fought at Callander between the Campbells of Argyll and the Atholl men. The Campbells were harassing the McGregors and the McNabs for their allegiance to Montrose. While besieging Castle Ample, the news came of the advance of 700 Atholl men under Inchbrakie. A retreat was made southwards, but, as the Campbells were crossing a ford to the east of the village of Callander, they were overtaken and compelled to give battle. Inchbrakie, advancing part of his force to attack the defenders, quietly marched another detachment towards a ford higher up near the present bridge. A crossing was soon effected, and the Campbells, being unexpectedly attacked on the rear, broke and fled, leaving eighty of their men dead on the field.

Although it is not known when the area was first settled, Callander is mentioned in parish records since at least the 15th century. The Medieval Parish of Callander was a patchwork of estates, settlements and farms and some of these survive in the present street names, such as Murdiestoun, Balgibbon and East Mains. The area around Callander was cleared for sheep before 1800 as part of the early phases of the Highland Clearances.

Scottish Gaelic was once widely spoken. In 1803, William Wordsworth and his sister, Dorothy, visited Callander and the Trossachs and recorded everyday encounters with Gaelic language and culture. In the 1840s sermons were delivered in both Gaelic and English, and Gaelic was taught in at least two schools in the area. By the 1880s most locals were speaking a mixture of Gaelic, Scots and English. In the 1900s, Celtic scholar, William J. Watson, documented, &quot;four Gaelic-speaking men born near Callander, two of whom were over 80 and had excellent knowledge of the place-names.&quot; However, one 19th century writer (Alexander MacGibbon) took objection to the local dialect, stating, &quot;The true Gaelic is a noble language, worthy of the fire of Ossian, and wonderfully adapted to the genius of a warlike nation; but the contemptible language of the people about Callander, and to the east, is quite incapable of communicating a noble idea.&quot;

Callander was served by rail from 1 July 1858 as the terminus of a branch line from Dunblane. A second Callander railway station was opened about to the west, behind the Dreadnought Hotel, on 1 June 1870 when the railway was extended to Killin en route to Oban, and closed on 5 November 1965. Sections of this former Callander and Oban Railway line, between Callander and Strathyre and between Balquhidder and Killin Junction, are now part of the National Cycle Network (route 7) and the Rob Roy Way. Track from the dismantled Callander and Oban Railway was used in the construction of the transit system for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.

The noted Scottish landscape artist Archibald Kay RSW RSA chose Callander as his home from 1904 and he became a noted resident of the town. A member of the Glasgow Art Club, The Paisley Art Institute and a close associate of fellow artist George Houston, Kay painted all around the River Leny and the hills of the Trossachs National Park and Kay is noted especially for his views of Ben Ledi overlooking Callander. Elected a member of the Scottish Royal Society of Arts, Kay was elected a member of the school board for McLaren High School in 1911 and was commissioned by Callander town council to design the war memorial to honour the fallen from the town and this was erected in Ancaster Square. Kay died in 1935 and is buried in Callander alongside his twelve year old son Archie, who drowned in a boating accident in 1907, and Archibald Kay&#x27;s cousin George Whitelaw who also drowned trying to save him. Kay&#x27;s second wife Mary also rests in the impressive Georgian style monument in the Stirling Road Cemetery.

<text>Levirate marriage is a type of marriage in which the brother of a deceased man is obliged to marry his brother&#x27;s widow. Levirate marriage has been practiced by societies with a strong clan structure in which exogamous marriage (i.e. marriage outside the clan) is forbidden.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;levirate&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;levir&quot;, meaning &quot;husband&#x27;s brother&quot;.

==Background and rationale==

Levirate marriage can, at its most positive, serve as protection for the widow and her children, ensuring that they have a male provider and protector. Levirate marriage can be a positive in a society where women must rely on men to provide for them, especially in societies where women are under the authority of, dependent on, in servitude to or regarded as possessions of their husbands, and to ensure the survival of the clan. The practice of levirate marriage is strongly associated with patriarchal societies. The practice was extremely important in ancient times (e.g., Ancient Near East), and remains so today in parts of the world. Having children enables the inheritance of land, which offers security and status.

A levirate marriage might only occur if a man died childless, in order to continue his family line. The anthropologist Ruth Mace also found that the practice of widow inheritance by younger brothers, common in many parts of Africa, serves to reduce population growth, as these men will be forced to marry older (and hence, less fertile) women.

==Judaism==

In the Hebrew Bible, a form of levirate marriage, called &quot;yibbum&quot;, is mentioned in , under which the brother of a man who dies without children is permitted and encouraged to marry the widow. Either of the parties may refuse to go through with the marriage, but then both must go through a ceremony, known as &quot;halizah&quot;, involving a symbolic act of renunciation of a &quot;yibbum&quot; marriage. Sexual relations with one&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife are otherwise forbidden by Leviticus 18 and Leviticus 20.

Jewish custom has seen a gradual decline of &quot;yibbum&quot; in favor of &quot;halizah&quot;, to the point where in most contemporary Jewish communities, and in Israel by mandate of the Chief Rabbinate, &quot;yibbum&quot; is prohibited.

This started already in time of Mishnah, &quot;The opinion of Abba Shaul, who said, &#x27;The mitzvah of ḥalitza takes precedence over the mitzvah of levirate marriage&#x27;&quot; (Yevamot 3a). &quot;Now that they do not have intent for the sake of fulfilling the mitzvah, the Sages say, The mitzvah of performing ḥalitza takes precedence over the mitzvah of consummating the levirate marriage&quot; (Babylonian Talmud, &quot;Yevamot&quot; 39b). In Yemen, however, the practice of Levirate marriage was observed by the Jewish community there until their immigration to the Land of Israel. In 1950, the Rabbinate of Israel, along with the Chief Sephardic Rabbi, forbade its practice amongst the Yemenites, citing a need for &quot;uniformity amongst the Jewish groups,&quot; and only permitted those who were already married through levirate marriage from outside the country.

==Islam==
Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;) clearly lays down rules for marriage, including who may marry whom, and although the Quran does not prohibit a man from marrying his brother&#x27;s widow, it does insist that if it were to be done, it should be treated as a normal marriage with the wife&#x27;s consent and a &quot;mahr&quot;.

==Eurasia==

===Scythia===
The levirate custom was revived in Scythia if there were shaky economic conditions in the decedent&#x27;s family. Khazanov, citing [Abramzon, 1968, p. 289 - 290], mentions that during World War II, the levirate was resurrected in Central Asia. In these circumstances, adult sons and brothers of the deceased man held themselves responsible to provide for his dependents. One of them would marry the widow and adopt her children, if there were any.

===Central Asia and Xiongnu===
The levirate custom survived in the society of Northeastern Caucasus Huns until the 7th century CE. The Armenian historian Movses Kalankatuatsi states that the Savirs, one of Hunnish tribes in the area, were usually monogamous, but sometimes a married man would take his brother&#x27;s widow as a polygynous wife. Ludmila Gmyrya, a Dagestani historian, asserts that the levirate survived into &quot;ethnographic modernity&quot; (from the context, probably 1950s). Kalankatuatsi describes the form of levirate marriage practised by the Huns. As women had a high social status, the widow had a choice whether to remarry or not. Her new husband might be a brother or a son (by another woman) of her first husband, so she could end up marrying her brother-in-law or stepson; the difference in age did not matter. Hungarians also practiced levirate marriages. Koppány&#x27;s rebellion against the Christian king Stephen I and claim to marry Sarolt, the widow of his relative Géza, was qualified as an incestuous attempt by 14th-century Hungarian chronicles, but was fully in line with the pagan custom.

===India===
In 2017, the Indian Army removed a rule which restricted payment of monetary allowances to widows of gallantry awardees if she marries someone other than the late husband&#x27;s brother. Previously, the payment of an allowance was continued until her death or until she re-married, unless the new husband was the late husband&#x27;s brother.

The most famous instance of levirate marriage in India was the wedding of the Panchala princess Draupadi to the five Pandava brothers. It is a main plot point of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, though heavily discussed in the text as being controversial. (Polygamy, however, was common at the time.)

===Indonesia===
According to the &quot;adat&quot; (customary practice) of the Karo people in North Sumatra, Indonesia, polygyny is permitted. A study of Kutagamber, a Karo village in the 1960s, noted one instance of the practice, as a result of levirate. The Indonesian term for it is &quot;turun ranjang&quot; (lit.: get down off one&#x27;s bed).

===Japan===
The Japanese had a custom of levirate marriage called &quot;aniyome ni naosu&quot; (兄嫁に直す) during the Meiji period.

===Kurds===
Levirate marriages among the Kurds are very common and also among the Kurds in Turkey, especially in Mardin.
Levirate is practised in Kurdistan: a widowed woman stays with her husband&#x27;s family. If she is widowed when her children are young, she is obliged to marry her deceased husband&#x27;s brother. This form of marriage is called levirate. Sororate marriage is another custom: When a man loses his wife before she bears a child or she dies leaving young children, her lineage provides another wife to the man, usually a younger sister with a lowered bride price. Both levirate and sororate are practiced to guarantee the well being of children and ensure that any inheritance of land will stay within the family.

===Kyrgyz===
&quot;The Kyrgyz people practice levirate whereby the wife of a deceased male is very often married by a younger sibling of the deceased.&quot; &quot;Kirghiz ... followed levirate marriage customs, i.e., a widow who had borne at least one child was entitled to a husband from the same lineage as her deceased spouse.&quot;

===Korea===
The Korean kingdom of Goguryeo also had a custom of levirate marriage. An example of this was king Sansang of Goguryeo marrying the queen of Gogukcheon of Goguryeo, who was his older brother&#x27;s wife.

===Manchu===
The existence of levirate marriage is supported by the case of Korean Princess Uisun who was brought to the Later Jin dynasty to marry the Manchu prince Dorgon and married his nephew after he died.

==Africa==

=== Central African Republic ===
Levirate marriage is commonly practiced among Goula who mostly live in northern part of Central African Republic. 

===Cameroon===
Among the Mambila of northern Cameroon, in regard to &quot;Inheritance of wives: both levirates are practised throughout the tribe&quot;.

===Kenya===
As among the Maragoli of western Kenya, likewise &quot;in the Luo case widows become mostly remarried to the deceased husband&#x27;s brother&quot;.

In the highlands of Kenya, it is &quot;Nandi custom for a widow to be &#x27;taken over&#x27; ... by a brother ... of her deceased husband.&quot; &quot;According to customary law, it is tantamount to adultery for a widow to be sexually involved with a man other than a close agnate of her late husband.&quot;

===Nigeria===
In some parts of Nigeria, it is a common practice for a woman to marry her late husband&#x27;s brother if she had children. This enabled the children to retain the father&#x27;s family identity and inheritance. Although less common today, it is still practiced:
===Somalia===
In Somalia, levirate marriage is practiced and is called &quot;Dumaal&quot;, and provisions are made under Somali customary law or &quot;Xeer&quot; with regard to bride price (&quot;yarad&quot;). The widow is usually given a choice in the matter. In the past few decades since the start of the Somali Civil War, this type of marriage has fallen out of favor due to strict Islamic interpretations that have been imported to Somalia.

===South Sudan===

Levirate marriages are very common among South Sudan&#x27;s Nilotic peoples, especially among the Dinka and Nuer people.

An alternate form, the ghost marriage, occurs when a groom dies before marriage. The deceased groom is replaced by his brother who serves as a stand in to the bride; any resulting children are considered children of the deceased spouse.

===Zimbabwe===
In Zimbabwe, levirate marriage is practiced amongst the Shona people, and provisions are made under Zimbabwe customary law, with regard to bride price (&quot;roora&quot;). The widow is usually given a choice in the matter, as well as the widower. In the past few decades, this type of marriage has fallen out of favor due to increased rural-to urban migration as well as improved literacy for women and girls.

===Pre-colonial Inca civilization===

Spanish chronicler, Juan de Betanzos, described the practice of levirate marriage which he saw observed in Peru in the early 16th-century by the people ruled by the Inca: &quot;If the first husband of a woman died and the woman wanted to marry, she would be married to the closest relative of her husband. If children remained from her first husband, she should rear them as her own. If the first husband left no children, the second should be from the same lineage and the lineage would continue and the blood of those of Cuzco would not be mixed with that of some other nation or disappear.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Levirate marriages serve as a plot-element in various works of fiction:

* In William Shakespeare&#x27;s iconic play Hamlet, the titular character&#x27;s paternal uncle; Claudius, marries his mother, after the death of Hamlet&#x27;s father. It is later revealed by the late king&#x27;s ghost that Claudius murdered his brother, in order to seize the throne and marry his sister-in-law.

* The plot of &quot;Holy Matrimony&quot; (1994) is based on a levirate marriage, but the real-life Hutterites don&#x27;t have such custom.
* In the TV series &quot;Deadwood&quot;, Seth Bullock is married to his brother&#x27;s widow. This is a plot point used to mitigate guilt in the adulterous affair between Alma (another widow), and Seth (2005). 
* In the Tamil novel &quot;Arukattuthurai&quot; (2006), Aruldas, (younger brother of Samuel) marries his sister-in-law Samuthiravalli, nearly three years after Samuel goes missing.
* In &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, Lord Eddard Stark marries his brother Brandon&#x27;s betrothed, Catelyn Tully after the death of Brandon.
* In &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; (2011–2016), it makes mention of Eva&#x27;s late husband Gregory Toole having killed himself, his brother having tradition to marry her as his brother&#x27;s widow.

==See also==
* Avunculism, a cultural custom in which a maternal uncle demonstrates some institutionalised interest in his sister&#x27;s offspring and may take on many of the responsibilities typically associated with fatherhood; this is a role, for instance, among American Indian peoples who have matrilineal cultures.
* Sororal polygyny, a marriage of two or more sisters and a man.
* Fraternal polyandry, a marriage of two or more brothers and one woman
* Genealogy of Jesus, in which Levirate marriage is offered to explain discrepancies
* Posthumous marriage, a marriage in which at least one party is dead
* Widow conservation

<text>Coldstream () is a town and civil parish in the Scottish Borders area of Scotland. A former burgh, Coldstream was where the Coldstream Guards, a regiment in the British Army, originated.

== Description ==
Coldstream lies on the north bank of the River Tweed in Berwickshire, while Northumberland in England lies to the south bank, with Cornhill-on-Tweed the nearest village. At the 2001 census, the town had a population of 1,813, which was estimated to have risen to 2,050 by 2006. The parish, in 2001, had a population of 6,186.

== History ==

Coldstream is the location where Edward I of England invaded Scotland in 1296. In February 1316 during the Wars of Scottish Independence, Sir James Douglas defeated a numerically superior force of Gascon soldiery led by Edmond de Caillou at the Skaithmuir to the north of the town. In 1650 General George Monck founded the Coldstream Guards regiment (a part of the Guards Division, Foot Guards regiments of the British Army). It is one of two regiments of the Household Division that can trace its lineage to the New Model Army. Monck led the regiment to London, helping to enable the Restoration of King Charles II.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Coldstream was a popular centre for runaway marriages, much like Gretna Green, as it lay on a major road (now the A697). A monument to Charles Marjoribanks (1794–1833), MP for Berwickshire, whose ancestral home was in nearby Lees, stands at the east end of the town, near the Coldstream Bridge. Alec Douglas-Home (1903–95), who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from October 1963 to October 1964, is buried in the churchyard of the ruined Lennel parish church, just outside the village.

Notable buildings in the town include the marriage house, where weddings were conducted, The Hirsel, which is the family seat of the Earls of Home, and Coldstream Town Hall, which is used as a library and registration office.

Each year, during the first week of August, Coldstream hosts a traditional &quot;Civic Week&quot; where it includes historical aspects of the town&#x27;s history such as the Torchlight procession and horse-rides to the Battle of Flodden battlefield.

===Coldstream Priory===

The Priory of St Mary was founded before 1166 by Gospatric III, Earl of Lothian. Never wealthy or powerful, the monastery nevertheless occurs frequently in the history of the border lands, being targeted several times by English forces. The monastery is the only one from the period where any charters survive thanks to the good sense of the prioress, having them copied. The house was used by both the English and Scots to gather information on each other, thanks to its location, the prioress treading a tightrope to ensure the survival of the monastery. It became a favourite of Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, Margaret using it several times during the troubled times of the Regency. 

After the Battle of Flodden, the prioress had all the bodies of the Scottish casualties (apart from James IV’s, which was taken to England) brought to the monastery for burial - an event commemorated annually even today, by a procession &amp; service, involving cutting a sod of grass from the battle field and it being carried back to Coldstream; since the priory is completely lost today, the sod is symbolically ‘buried’ on the Tweed Green. The last prioress signed away her community and it ceased to exist as a legal entity in 1621, although no new novices had been permitted since the 1560 Reform Parliament. No reliable record of the number of nuns living in the house have survived. Isabella Hoppringle (1460–1538) was the prioress of Coldstream from 1505 until her death. She was succeeded by her relative, Janet Pringle, the last ‘real’ prioress of the house.

=== Bughtrig House ===

In February 2020, the Scottish Borders Council announced plans to build a museum at the family home of Vice-Admiral Bertram Home Ramsay, who masterminded Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Dunkirk. &quot;A former garden store will be converted at Bughtrig House in Coldstream to create the museum in his honour,&quot; BBC News reported.

== The Ba Green ==
The border between Scotland and England runs down the middle of the River Tweed, however between the villages of Wark and Cornhill the Scottish border comes south of the river to enclose a small riverside meadow of approximately 2 to 3 acres (or about a hectare). This piece of land is known as the Ba Green. It is said locally that every year the men of Coldstream would play the men of Wark (south of the river) at ba, and the winning side would claim the Ba Green for their country. As Coldstream grew to have a larger population than Wark, the men of Coldstream always defeated those of Wark at the game, and so the land became a permanent part of Scotland.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Scotland and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the Selkirk TV transmitter. BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees can also be received from the Chatton TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Scotland on 93.5 FM, BBC Radio Newcastle can also be received on 96.0 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Scottish Borders and North Northumberland on 96.8 FM.

The Border Telegraph and Southern Reporter are the town&#x27;s local newspapers.

<text>Culross (/ˈkurəs/) (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Cuileann Ros&quot;, &#x27;holly point or promontory&#x27;) is a village and former royal burgh, and parish, in Fife, Scotland.

According to the 2006 estimate, the village has a population of 395. Originally, Culross served as a port city on the Firth of Forth and is believed to have been founded by Saint Serf during the 6th century.

The civil parish had a population of 4,348 in 2011.

==Founding legend==
A legend states that when the Brittonic princess (and future saint) Teneu, daughter of the king of Lothian, became pregnant before marriage, her family threw her from a cliff. She survived the fall unharmed, and was soon met by an unmanned boat. She knew she had no home to go to, so she got into the boat; it sailed her across the Firth of Forth to land at Culross, where she was cared for by Saint Serf; he became foster-father of her son, Saint Kentigern (or Mungo).

==West Kirk and Abbey==

The parish appears to have originally centred further west. The original church, later known as the &quot;West Kirk&quot; perhaps dates to the 11th century but was abandoned around 1500 and, therefore, did not come into play in 1560 at the time of the Reformation; however, it continued to be used for burials into the 20th century, being a long-established burial ground.

The Cistercian Abbey, dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint Serf, was built around to the east in 1217, being founded by Malcolm, Earl of Fife. Part of this became the parish church in 1560 and was restored in 1905. A Chapel of St. Mungo (now wholly lost) was erected in 1503 by Robert Blackadder, Archbishop of Glasgow.

The first recorded minister was John Dykes (1567). He was replaced in 1593 by Robert Colville, of Linlithgow, who ministered until 1629, when replaced by his assistant Robert Melville. John Duncan MA took over in 1632. Duncan was pensioned off in 1642 but is recorded as joining the camp of General Leslie at Newcastle 1646–1647 during the English Civil War.

In the 17th century, its most notable minister was the Covenanter James Fraser of Brea, who took over in 1689.

==Industry==
During the 16th and 17th centuries, the town was a centre of the coal-mining industry. Sir George Bruce of Carnock, who built Culross Palace and whose elaborate family monument stands in the north transept of the Abbey church, established a coal mine at Culross in 1575. In 1590, he constructed the Moat Pit at Culross, the first coal mine in the world to extend under the sea. The mine worked what is now known as the Upper Hirst coal seam, with ingenious contrivances to drain the constant leakage from above. This mine was considered one of the marvels of the British Isles in the early 17th century, described by one visitor, John Taylor, as &quot;a wonder ... an unfellowed and unmatchable work&quot;, until the Moat Pit was destroyed in a storm on 30 March 1625.

Culross&#x27;s secondary industry was salt panning. There were seven salt pans at Culross in 1573. The Privy Council of Scotland allowed the proprietors, led by John Blaw and Alexander Eizatt, to export salt and they undertook to pay a duty in silver to the Scottish royal mint. In 1574, Regent Morton revoked licences to export salt because of a shortage of salt in Scotland.

There was a considerable export trade by sea in the produce of these industries, and the prevalence of red roof tiles in Culross and other villages in Fife is thought to be a direct result of collier ships returning to Culross with Dutch roof tiles as ballast. The town was also known for its monopoly on the manufacture of girdles, a colloquial name for flat iron plates for baking over an open fire.

In the late 18th century, Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald, established kilns for extracting coal tar using his patented method.

The town&#x27;s role as a port declined from the 18th century, and by Victorian times it had become something of a ghost town. The harbour was filled in and the sea cut off by the coastal railway line in the very early part of the 20th century. The outer pier has recently been the subject of restoration work.

==Heritage==

Notable buildings in the burgh include Culross Town House, formerly used as a courthouse and prison, the 16th-century Culross Palace, 17th-century Study, and the remains of the Cistercian house of Culross Abbey, founded 1217. The tower, transepts and choir of the Abbey Church remain in use as the parish church, while the ruined claustral buildings are cared for by Historic Environment Scotland.

The West Kirk fell out of use before 1633, when it was noted as no longer serving as the parish church. The West Kirk was also the site where four women executed for witchcraft in 1675 were alleged to have congregated.

Just outside the town is the 18th-century Dunimarle Castle, built by the Erskine family to supersede a medieval castle.

Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald, spent much of his early life in Culross, where his family had an estate. A bust in his honour, the work of Scott Sutherland, can be seen outside the Town House. He was the first Vice Admiral of Chile.

The war memorial was erected in 1921 to a design by Sir Robert Lorimer.

During the 20th century, it became recognised that Culross contained many unique historical buildings, and the National Trust for Scotland has been working on their preservation and restoration since the 1930s.

== Administration==
Prior to the 1890s, the parishes of Culross and Tulliallan formed an exclave of Perthshire. It is within the Dunfermline and West Fife Westminster Parliamentary constituency.

==Culross as a location for filming==

Several motion pictures have used Culross as a filming location, including &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1971), &quot;The Little Vampire&quot; (2000), &quot;A Dying Breed&quot; (2007), &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; (2008) and &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011). In September 2013, the Starz television series &quot;Outlander&quot; started filming in Culross for its premiere in August 2014.

<doc id="407165" wikidata="Q1010019" url="?curid=407165" title="Cumnock">
<text>Cumnock (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Cumnag&quot;) is a town and former civil parish located in East Ayrshire, Scotland. The town sits at the confluence of the Glaisnock Water and the Lugar Water. There are three neighbouring housing projects which lie just outside the town boundaries, Craigens, Logan and Netherthird, with the former ironworks settlement of Lugar also just outside the town, contributing to a population of around 13,000 in the immediate locale. A new housing development, Knockroon, was granted planning permission on 9 December 2009 by East Ayrshire Council.

The town is home to the Robert Burns Academy, a new educational campus housing the main Robert Burns Academy secondary school following the merger of Cumnock Academy and Auchinleck Academy, Lochnorris Primary School and Cherry Trees Early Childhood Centre. The campus is the largest educational establishment in Scotland.

The 2011 UK Census revealed that the Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock constituency, of which Cumnock is part, had an above-average unemployment rate at 5.6% compared to the Scottish average of 4.8%, with a significant proportion of residents living in local authority housing at 20.2% compared to the Scottish average of 13.2%. The constituency also had a high proportion of retired people and Church of Scotland Protestants at the Census relative to elsewhere in Scotland, with 19% of those living in the constituency retired (14.9% across Scotland) and 43.3% of constituents recognising their religion as Church of Scotland (32.4% across Scotland). 90% of residents identified their ethnicity as White British, with 99% recognising their ethnicity as White. On indicators such as health, educational attainment, income and social class however the area is more deprived than the national average.

==History==
===Early Cumnock===
====Etymology====
The origin of the name &quot;Cumnock&quot; has been debated over the years and several interpretations have been offered.
*Com-cnoc, (hollow of the hills)
*Com-oich, (meeting of the waters)
*Cam-cnoc, (crooked hill)
*Cumanag, (little shrine)

====Early history====
This part of Ayrshire has seen human settlement for over 5,000 years. There are many Bronze Age burial sites around the nearby area.

====Medieval history====
The patron saint of Cumnock is Saint Conval. It is believed that a place of worship has existed in Cumnock&#x27;s Square for over 1,100 years, although the records do not begin until about 1275. James IV created the Burgh of Cumnock. Three castles existed in the parish of Old Cumnock, namely Borland, Terringzean and Lefnories or Lochnorris. Lefnories was the largest and was replaced as a dwelling by Dumfries House, with only the below ground foundations remaining, excavated by the Marquess of Bute in the late 19th century.

William Wallace allegedly spent three months in the seat of Patrick Dunbar ((New) Cumnock or Cumno in 1296), according to the poem &quot;The Wallace&quot;, by Blind Harry. Robert the Bruce, Robert I, was in Cumnock in 1307 being pursued by two of Edward I&#x27;s men: Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and John MacDougall of Lorn. The latter used Bruce&#x27;s own bloodhound to track him. Bruce evaded capture and the bloodhound lost the scent when Bruce waded into a stream.

===Industrial Cumnock===

The town has a strong socialist heritage due to its history as a mining centre. The father of the Labour Party, James Keir Hardie, lived in the town for a large part of his life, and his statue sits outside Cumnock Town Hall. The left-wing politician Emrys Hughes was local MP for a time in the mid-20th century, and also lived in the town.

===Modern history===
Whilst many traditional industries in Cumnock have declined, such as coal mining, common in many parts of East Ayrshire, the area has seen some revival to its economy. The development of Knockroon was expected to continue over a 25-year period, creating construction jobs in the local area, and was backed by The Prince&#x27;s Foundation for the Built Environment, and is being designed on green principles. The first houses in the development were built by Hope Homes Scotland and ZeroC. Prince Charles has expressed a personal interest in the development. Construction started in April 2011.

In February 2019 &quot;The Scotsman&quot; reported that only 31 of the planned 770 homes had been built.

Emergency One, one of the largest producers of fire engines in the UK, is located in Cumnock, and is a major employer in the Cumnock and the surrounding areas. Like most communities affected by the decline in coal mining, Cumnock has shifted towards a more skilled base and services economy.

==Politics and governance== 
===Local government===
In East Ayrshire Council, the local government, Cumnock is represented as Cumnock and New Cumnock, whereby it elects four councillors to represent the area. Following the most recent 2022 East Ayrshire Council election, the four councillors elected to the ward were Billy Crawford (Scottish Labour Party), Neill Watts (Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party), Jim McMahon (Scottish National Party) and June Kyle (Scottish Labour Party). 

====Elected councillors====
===Scottish Parliament=== 
Cumnock is represented in the Scottish Parliament as Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, currently represented by Elena Whitham MSP (Scottish National Party), elected in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election and replaced Jeane Freeman. 

The Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency was created following the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, and since then has been represented by the following MSPs. 

===UK Parliament===
In the House of Commons, the UK Parliament, Cumnock is represented as Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock, currently represented by Allan Dorans MP (Scottish National Party). The constituency was created in the 2005 United Kingdom general election following the boundary review which saw the constituency created from the former constituencies of Ayr and Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley.

==Churches==
The town has six churches, five Protestant churches, the Congregational Church, Old Cumnock Old Parish Church, St Andrew&#x27;s United Free Church, Cumnock Trinity Church, Cumnock Baptist Church, and the Roman Catholic St John the Evangelist Church (1878–1880), by architect William Burges for the third Marquess of Bute.

==Education==
Cumnock is home to the largest educational campus in Scotland, the Robert Burns Academy, a new educational campus housing the main Robert Burns Academy secondary school following the merger of Cumnock Academy and Auchinleck Academy, Lochnorris Primary School and Cherry Trees Early Childhood Centre. 

One other primary school is located within the town at Netherthird Primary School. Barshare Primary School closed and was demolished in 2021 following the merger of Barshare and Greenmill Primary School to form the new Lochnorris Primary School located within the Barony Campus.

Nearby Dumfries House offers a variety of educational programmes and apprenticeships through the Dumfries House Educational Programme created by The Prince&#x27;s Trust. The programme offers vocational training and education in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM), textiles, outdoor and resilience building, hospitality and horticulture amongst others. When Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay&#x27;s, bought the estate of Dumfries House in 2007, he created the educational programme at Dumfries House in an attempt to see young people undertake learning experiences and training that promote confidence, personal development and offer training in real life skills.

Further education is provided at Ayrshire College, with its nearest campus in Kilmarnock, and university education at University of the West of Scotland located at the Ayr campus. 

==Transport== 
Cumnock has its own bus terminal, Cumnock Bus Station, which is operated by both Stagecoach West Scotland and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport. In July 2020, redevelopment of the bus station was completed with new shelters and CCTV being provided.

The original Cumnock railway station opened on 20 May 1850. The station was renamed to Cumnock on 10 January 1955, and closed to passengers on 6 December 1965. 

A second, and to date, last Cumnock railway station opened to passengers on 1 July 1872, and closed on 10 September 1951. The second Cumnock railway station was originally part of the Annbank to Cronberry Branch on the Glasgow and South Western Railway.

Cumnock is connected to nearby settlements including Kilmarnock, the principal town in East Ayrshire, and other smaller settlements such as Mauchline by the A76 road. The A70 also connects Cumnock to other large towns including Ayr.

<text>Doune (; from Scottish Gaelic: , meaning &#x27;the fort&#x27;) is a burgh within Perthshire. The town is administered by Stirling Council. Doune is assigned Falkirk postcodes starting &quot;FK&quot;. The village lies within the parish of Kilmadock and mainly within the area surrounded by the River Teith and Ardoch Burn.

In the 2001 Scottish census, 2.75% residents of Doune could speak Scottish Gaelic.

Doune has a small primary school with 183 pupils on the roll (June 2016), drawn from a catchment area which extends outside the town, especially to the north. It is located on the site of Doune Roman fort. Gaelic is taught in Primary 1–7 and Spanish is now taught from P5 upwards .

== History ==

The town is dominated by Doune Castle, built in the late 14th century. Architecturally it is a mixture of fortress and manor house.

Bonnie Prince Charlie passed through Doune in 1745.

Doune was also famous for its manufacture of pistols, but this eventually ceased due to the competition of manufacturers in, for example, Birmingham where production was cheaper. Today, these pistols are collected and can be found in major museums, including the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Allegedly a Doune pistol fired the first shot of the American War of Independence.

Throughout the parish the names most often met with are Campbell, Stewart, Ferguson, Morrison, McAlpine, McLaren, MacDonald, Mathieson and Cameron.

Land east of Doune was owned by the Stirling of Keir family (who still own a lot of the land around Keir House, but sold the house itself), and the current owner of the Keir Estates is the politician Archie Stirling. One member of the family, SAS founder David Stirling, is memorialised at a monument on the Keir land near Doune known as the Hill o&#x27; Rou.

== Sports ==
The local amateur football team Doune Castle AFC play in the Caledonian Amateur Football League.
The local cricket team play in the Strathmore &amp; Perthshire Cricket Union.

== Archaeology ==
Doune is well-known for its pistols and Roman remains, but the Doune area has been inhabited a lot longer and many burial mounds and standing stones supporting this are clearly evident and plentiful. To the rear of Doune where the ponds and the Doune Riggs housing development now sits was known locally as Currachmore. This area contained the bluebell wood, an area popular with walkers; it was also part of the Doune Golf course. This area was quarried and the sand coming from here was used in the construction of Longannet. Also lost to the quarrying was a mound measuring long, wide and high, known locally as the Round Wood. At the time of quarrying, a stone cist or coffin was uncovered and in it were remains of a small boy aged 6, with a small stone axe. He was identified as one of the Beaker people of the early Bronze Age, .

The remains of a Roman fort were excavated by Headland Archaeology. Three ditches and the base of a rampart were investigated comprising part of the defence works. Set into the back of the rampart five circular stone bread ovens were located. Running behind the ovens a gravel track was interpreted as the &quot;intervallum&quot; way (one of the internal roads of the fort). The foundations of a building that it is thought served as the fort’s hospital were also uncovered and an iron-smelting shaft furnace, a first for Roman Scotland. Fragments of samian ware and amphorae were recovered dating to the Flavian period and the first Roman incursion into Scotland (from 79 AD to the mid-80s AD). The remains of the Roman fort are a scheduled monument.

== Folklore ==
As in other Celtic lands, Doune has tales of fairies. One place associated with such folklore is Ternishee, a small wood east of the Annat chapel, above Doune Lodge, from Doune. Its name comes from the . Fairy dancing parties are recounted on the Fairy Knowe, a hillock on the right bank of the Ardoch, east of Doune. Near the Bridge of Teith, on the low road to Callander, a burial mound called Tullochanknowe is said to be a favourite haunt of the fairies.

== Other information ==
Doune Speed Hillclimb is the most prestigious hillclimb motorsport course in Scotland, and hosts a round of the British Hill Climb Championship each year.

The town used to be served by Doune railway station.

Doune has often been used as a filming location, most famously for &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; which was filmed at Doune Castle. The castle has also been used for major TV series, most notably &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;Outlander&quot;.

<text>Duns is a town in the Scottish Borders, Scotland. It was the county town of the historic county of Berwickshire.

==History==

===Early history===

Duns Law, the original site of the town of Duns, has the remains of an Iron Age hillfort at its summit. Similar structures nearby, such as the structure at Edin&#x27;s Hall Broch, suggest the area&#x27;s domestic and defensive use at a very early stage.

===Middle ages===
The first written mention of Duns is prior to 1179, when a &#x27;Hugo de Duns&#x27; witnessed a charter of Roger d&#x27;Eu, of a grant of the benefice of the church of Langton to Kelso Abbey. The town is further mentioned when a &#x27;Robert of Douns&#x27; signed the Ragman Roll in 1296. The early settlement was sited on the slopes of Duns Law, close to the original Duns Castle built in 1320 by the Earl of Moray, nephew of Robert the Bruce. The town was frequently attacked by the English in border raids and as they headed north to the Lothians. In 1318 at Duns Park, the Earl of Dunbar, Sir James Douglas, and Sir Thomas Randolph met with their respective forces, prior to the retaking of Berwick by the Scots. In 1333 the Guardian of Scotland, Sir Archibald Douglas, mustered an army in Duns to march on Berwick, which at that time was under siege by the English. The Scots troops were heavily defeated at the Battle of Halidon Hill.

1377 saw the Earl of Northumberland invade Scotland. Camped at Duns, his army&#x27;s horses were alarmed at night by the rattles used by the inhabitants to scare birds from their crops. The disarrayed English force was routed by the townsmen. The event is known as the Battle of Duns, and is the source of the town&#x27;s motto, Duns Dings A!

In 1513, some to the north of the town at Ellemford, James IV of Scotland mustered his army, prior to his campaign that would lead to the disastrous Battle of Flodden.

===Early modern===
The town was created a Burgh of Barony in 1490 by James IV heritably for John and George Hume of Ayton, and the townsfolk were given the right to hold a market every Wednesday, and to hold a week-long annual fair between Pentecost and Trinity Sunday. Duns suffered badly in cross-border raiding and feuding, and was burned to the ground three times within 14 years, in 1544, 1545 and 1558 during the war of the Rough Wooing.

By 1588, the town had relocated from the top of Duns Law to its present location at its foot. The burgh&#x27;s ruined original location has since been known as the &quot;Bruntons&quot; (a corruption of Burnt-town).
In the autumn of 1517, Duns Market Cross was also the destination of the head of the Sieur de la Bastie, the French Ambassador and Warden of the Eastern March, following his murder at Preston, by Home of Wedderburn.
&quot;Bautie, tha heidet, and in the toun of Dunce his heid affixt on a staik, that all men mycht se it, September xix.&quot;

In 1630, Duns was home to a Margaret Lumsden, who was supposedly the victim of demonic possession. She was brought to Edinburgh to be investigated by John Maitland, 1st Earl of Lauderdale and the Privy Council of Scotland, and arrangements were made to have her and her immediate family lodged in the Canongate Tolbooth. Lauderdale&#x27;s son John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale recounted the story in a letter to Richard Baxter which he published in his work, &quot;The certainty of the World of Spirits&quot;. Margaret Lumsden was said to be a poor uneducated woman, yet when spoken to in Latin by the local minister, John Weemes, she is said to have replied in better Latin than he had himself.
In 1639, during the First Bishops&#x27; War, Duns became the mustering point for the Covenanting army led by General Leslie, gathered there to face King Charles I&#x27;s English host encamped at Berwick. Leslie took up residence in the Castle and ordered a redoubt to be constructed on Duns Law. The opposing armies did not engage but on 18 June, the Pacification of Berwick was signed. The remains of Leslie&#x27;s fortifications are still evident on top of Duns Law.

Oliver Cromwell put a garrison into the town after the Battle of Dunbar on 3 September 1650.

By 1670, the town and the estate were bought by Sir John Cockburn of Cockburn from the Homes of Ayton, who had a regrant of the Burgh charter. The estate was then sold in 1696 to John Hay, 1st Marquess of Tweeddale who granted to his son the Lord William Hay following his marriage to Elizabeth Seton, a daughter of Alexander Seton, 1st Viscount of Kingston.

In the peace following the end of the Jacobite rebellion in 1746, Duns began to expand and many of the administrative functions of Berwickshire were carried out in the town. In 1903, a bill first introduced by the Secretary for Scotland in 1900 was passed confirming Duns as the county town of Berwickshire when nearby Greenlaw lost that status the following year.

Within living memory, Duns had a Tolbooth or town hall on its Market Square. This was used for the administration of the burgh and for dealing with malefactors: the first such structure was built in 1328, presumably in the old town at Duns Law; the second was built following Cockburn&#x27;s rechartering of the burgh in 1680. The 1680 building was badly damaged by fire in 1795, and was replaced by a third building designed by the architect James Gillespie Graham in 1816. The structure was demolished in 1966.

===County town===

After Berwickshire&#x27;s original county town of Berwick-upon-Tweed was finally ceded to English control in 1482, Duns and Lauder initially shared the role of county town between them (principally hosting the sheriff court), until 1596 when Greenlaw was declared the county town. Duns was made county town again by the } (c. 136), but lost the role back to Greenlaw in 1696. By the mid-nineteenth century it was felt that Duns was the more important town than Greenlaw, which remained a small village. The Berwickshire Courts Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 27) was passed allowing the courts and meetings of the county&#x27;s Commissioners of Supply to be held at Duns as well as at the County Hall in Greenlaw. County Buildings was subsequently built at 8 Newtown Street in Duns in 1856.

Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking over most of the functions of the commissioners. Berwickshire County Council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at County Hall in Greenlaw, when it decided by 18 votes to 12 that all subsequent meetings should be held at Duns. The county council therefore based itself at the County Buildings in Duns, sharing the premises with its continuing use as a sheriff court. The county council subsequently established additional offices in various converted houses along Newtown Street. A modern extension was added to County Buildings in 1967.

Greenlaw was still considered the official county town after 1890, despite the county council meeting in Duns and courts being held at both towns. The Berwickshire County Town Act 1903 (3 Edw. 7. c. 5) finally revoked Greenlaw&#x27;s status as county town and declared Duns to be the county town for all purposes. The County Buildings on Newtown Street served as the headquarters of Berwickshire County Council until 1975, then became the offices of Berwickshire District Council from 1975 until 1996. It also served as the county&#x27;s sheriff court until 2015.

==Modern day==
Duns has the largest shopping facilities in a radius of and until 28 January 2015 housed the Berwickshire Sheriff Court, it no longer has any principal offices of the Scottish Borders Council, but merely retains a Registry Office.
Since the early 1990s Duns and its immediate vicinity have seen substantial housing development, some controversial. A development near the golf club on the road to Longformacus just outside Duns is one such example, as it was built upon greenfield sites.

Opposite the old Berwickshire High School a new modern High School has been constructed to replace the mid-1950s buildings in which the school was previously housed. The new High School opened in February 2009.

The old high school has as of 2017 been redeveloped into a primary school, with the rugby and football club using the old playing fields.

==Castle==
The Hay family were responsible for the present Gothic Revival structure; prior to that, it had been a substantial Peel tower built in 1320 by the Earl of Moray who had been granted the estate by Robert I.

==Country houses==
The surrounding area once had a considerable number of notable country houses. Those surviving include:

*The Edwardian mansion Manderston House (rebuilt in 1903), the home of a Liberal Peer, Lord Palmer, just outside the burgh on the A6105 road to Berwick-upon-Tweed.
*The early 18th century Edrom House (after architect James Smith), east of Manderston and formerly the home of the model, Stella Tennant who is buried in Edrom Cemetery in the grounds of Edrom Church adjacent to her home.
*About a mile east of Edrom stands Blanerne Castle, an ancient seat of the Lumsden family, rebuilt by architect William Burn in 1895 following a fire. Its ruined mediaeval Pele Tower stands nearby.
*Nisbet House () with its great tower (1774) is about south of the town, now restored as a family home.
*Cairnbank House (c. 1787) is a Category B-listed house built by Robert Ainslie of Laws. It has been in the Pate family since 1913. 
*Wedderburn Castle (1771–1775, by architects Robert and James Adam) is east of Duns and is built on the site of the earlier Tower house. It is the seat of the Homes of Wedderburn.
*Further south lies Kimmerghame House, a Scottish Baronial mansion completely rebuilt in 1851 by architect David Bryce, almost destroyed by fire in 1938 but again much rebuilt. It is now the seat of a former Lord Lieutenant of Berwickshire, Major-General Sir John Swinton (father of the actress Tilda Swinton).

==The Jim Clark Motorsport Museum==

The town hosts the Jim Clark Motorsport Museum. The Clark family lived on a farm by Chirnside, near Duns. Among his many achievements, Jim Clark was Formula 1 World Champion in 1963 and 1965, with 72 Grand Prix starts, 25 Wins, and 33 Pole Positions. Originally opened in 1969 as a Memorial Room, the building was expanded and the museum opened in 2019 and displays his Lotus race car, a rally car, overalls worn by Clark, and over 100 trophies. Other ephemera include numerous archive material from newspapers, books, magazines and films.

==Polish War Memorial==

During the Second World War, the Scottish Borders was home to many Polish soldiers, who had come here to form new regiments prior to returning south to go the front in Europe. Duns, and the surrounding area, was home to the First and Second Armoured Regiments of the Polish Army, who learned and practised their armoured warfare skills on the moors of Berwickshire. It was as a tribute to the 127 men of these regiments who died in the conflict, that Polish ex-soldiers and the people of Duns, jointly, paid for the erection of this monument. It was unveiled in 1981 by their former Commanding Officer, General Maczek.

As well as this a memorial to Wojtek, a Syrian brown bear which was adopted by the Polish army in 1943, can be found in the Market Square. The memorial was gifted by the twin town of Żagań in Poland and was unveiled in 2016.

==Transport==
Duns was historically connected to the railway network by the Berwickshire Railway but that closed to passengers on 10 September 1951, and to goods traffic during the Beeching closures on 7 November 1966.

Two A roads pass through the town; the A6105 which runs west to east from Earlston to Berwick on Tweed and the A6112 which runs south to north from Coldstream to Grantshouse.

The town is served by the regular Perryman&#x27;s 60 service between Galashiels and Berwick-upon-Tweed. It is also served by Travelsure service 34 to Eyemouth and Berwick-upon-Tweed, and Travelsure service 260 and Wait&#x27;s service 18 which both serve Chirnside, Berwick-upon-Tweed and Tweedmouth.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Scotland and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the Selkirk transmitter and a local relay transmitter situated in Eyemouth. BBC North East and Cumbria can also be received from the Chatton TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Scotland on 94.1 FM, BBC Radio Newcastle can also be heard on 96.0, and Greatest Hits Radio Scottish Borders and North Northumberland on 103.4 FM.

The Border Telegraph and Southern Reporter are the town&#x27;s local newspapers.

==Education==
Duns primary school, previously located near the town centre in a Victorian building, moved to refurbished premises in the old Berwickshire High School in 2017. The new Berwickshire High School opened in 2009 and is located to the west of the town on the A6105 and provides higher education not only for pupils from Duns but also the many surrounding villages and wider rural community. Borders College also has a small campus in the town.

==The Ba game of Duns==
This is a kind of medieval football. Three balls or &quot;Bas&quot; were required for this game; the first was gold, the second silvered, and the third coloured or spotted. A fourth was provided in case of mishap, and if not needed was presented to the subscriber whose entertainment had been most hospitable, the Hay family at Duns Castle usually being the recipients.

At mid-day the honour of throwing up the ball would be auctioned in the Kirkyard. The throw would invariably be performed by a member of the Duns Castle family. At 1 o&#x27;clock the game began, the Ba being thrown up in the Market Square. The goal for the married men was the pulpit of the church; if a goal was scored then the church bell would rung by the victors. The goal of the bachelors was the hopper of any of the grinding mills in the district, the nearest being over a mile (1500 m) away. If a bachelor won the Ba he would be dusted with flour and receive a meal of pork and dumplings from the miller.

The game was revived in 1949 as part of the Duns Summer Festival. The goals are now at opposite corners of the Market Square, by the White Swan hotel and the old Post Office.

The game of Hand Ba&#x27; takes place at various places throughout the Scottish Borders: Duns, Jedburgh, Denholm, Hobkirk and it is known to take place as far afield as the Orkney Islands - there is a documentary archived of such an event.

<text>Fortrose is a town and former royal burgh on the Black Isle in the Highland council area of Scotland, about northeast of Inverness. The town is known for its ruined 13th-century cathedral, and as the home of the Brahan Seer. Chanonry Point, a nearby headland projecting into the Moray Firth, is a popular location for dolphin spotting. 

== Names ==
Fortrose was historically known as the &quot;Chanonry of Ross&quot;, as it was where the canons of Fortrose Cathedral made their homes. It is still known in Gaelic as , meaning &quot;place of canons&quot;.

The origin of the name &quot;Fortrose&quot; is uncertain. One possibility is that it came from nearby Chanonry Point and originally meant the headland () of the Fortriu, a local ethonym. Compare the etymology of Montrose in Angus. The locals pronounce the name , with the stress on the first syllable.

== History ==
Archaeological investigations, by Headland Archaeology, in 2013, as part of a planning condition for the creation of a housing development found domestic activity dating from the Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. There was evidence of cereal production and the gathering of wild resources. The archaeologists also found that funerary practices change on the peninsula during that time from stone cist burials to cremation burials.

In the Middle Ages it was the seat of the bishopric of Ross, and formerly called &quot;Chanonry&quot;, for being the Chanory of Ross. Fortrose owes its origins to the decision by Bishop Robert in the 13th century to build a new Cathedral of Ross there. This was to replace the Church of St Peter in nearby Rosemarkie. The cathedral was largely demolished in the mid-seventeenth century by Oliver Cromwell to provide building materials for a citadel at Inverness. The vaulted south aisle, with bell-tower, and a detached chapter house (used as the tollbooth of Fortrose after the Reformation) remain. These fragments, though modest in scale, display considerable architectural refinement, and are in the care of Historic Scotland (no entrance charge).

Fortrose was a parliamentary burgh, combined with Inverness, Forres and Nairn, in the Inverness Burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. The constituency was abolished in 1918 and the Fortrose component was merged into the then new constituency of Ross and Cromarty.

==Fortrose Academy==
Fortrose Academy is the only secondary school on the Black Isle. It feeds in pupils from the respective primary schools of Avoch, Cromarty, Culbokie, Munlochy, North Kessock, Resolis, and Tore. There are around 640 pupils enrolled. Notable former teachers include Mr A. Tait, who won the Teacher of the Year Award in Scotland, 2006. The previous rector of the school is Jacquie Ross.

==Fortrose Library==
Built into the school is Fortrose library, which is part of the Highland Libraries group. The library is regularly used by pupils in Fortrose Academy, for which the younger years take out books to participate in the &quot;power readers&quot; scheme, which involves pupils getting rewards for reading a certain number of books, and passing on to the next level. Due to the library&#x27;s small size, the stock is always changing.

==Black Isle Leisure Centre==
Situated next to the school is the Black Isle Leisure Centre. It consists of a gym, and one single indoor court which has space for four badminton courts, four small basketball courts or one full sized basketball court. It also has goals at either end for football. Pupils of Fortrose Academy regularly have PE lessons in the Leisure Centre.

==Transport==
The A832 runs through the town.

There is a bus service from Inverness that runs half-hourly weekdays (with a few gaps for schools traffic). The buses continue hourly to Cromarty.

There was a railway station at Fortrose, which closed in 1951. The line it was situated on closed in 1960.

<text>The Social Democratic Pole of Romania (, PDSR) was an electoral alliance in Romania ruling from 2000 to 2003 in a coalition government.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
It was founded by the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), and of two smaller parties, the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR) and the Humanist Party of Romania (PUR).

=== 2000 legislative election ===
In the 2000 legislative election, they gained 155 of 346 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and 65 of 143 seats in the Senate. In 2001, the PDSR and PSDR merged into the Social Democratic Party (PSD).

=== Dissolution ===
The two remaining parties dissolved the alliance in 2004, ahead of the local elections, in which they competed against each other. The PUR even attacked the PSD heavily for its system of &quot;local barons&quot;. For the parliamentary election in November, they still managed to set up a new alliance, called National Union PSD+PUR to counter the center-right Justice and Truth Alliance (DA).

<text>Grangemouth (; , ) is a town in the Falkirk council area in the central belt of Scotland. Historically part of the county of Stirlingshire, the town lies in the Forth Valley, on the banks of the Firth of Forth, east of Falkirk, west of Bo&#x27;ness and south-east of Stirling. Grangemouth had a resident population of 17,906 according to the 2001 Census. Preliminary figures from the 2011 census reported the number as 17,373.

Grangemouth&#x27;s original growth as a town relied mainly on its geographical location. Originally a bustling port, trade flowed through the town with the construction of the Forth and Clyde Canal in the 18th century. Nowadays, the economy of Grangemouth is focused primarily on the large petrochemical industry of the area which includes the oil refinery, owned by Ineos, one of the largest of its kind in Europe. The town is twinned with La Porte, Indiana, U.S.A.

Residents of the town are known as Portonians.

==History==
Grangemouth was founded by Sir Lawrence Dundas in 1768 as a result of the construction of the Forth and Clyde Canal. Originally referred to as &quot;Sealock&quot; by workers brought in to labour on the canal digging and lock constructions, the name referred to the Forth and Clyde Canal connection to the sea and where it flowed into the River Forth. After Dundas died in 1781 his son Thomas Dundas commissioned the architect Henry Holland to re-plan the town including the layout around the canal and its basin. The settlement acquired the name &quot;Grangeburnmouth&quot; and later &quot;Grangemouth&quot;, referring to its situation at the mouth of the Grange Burn (which originally entered the Carron at Grangemouth Harbour, though it has since been diverted to flow straight into the Forth).
As canal and general shipping traffic came to the town the area became more prosperous. This was aided by the high tariffs at the port of Leith which caused more traffic to pass through Grangemouth instead. Additionally, the dredging and a major re-alignment of the River Carron for deeper draught vessels and the founding of collieries to the North of the town saw the increase in trade to and from the Baltic States. Being downstream from the world-famous Carron Company also increased the volume of shipping to the town as cast iron products and armaments were transported around the globe. Until 1810, duties had to paid on cargoes through the customs house at Bo&#x27;ness which benefited from the duties paid and involved a journey of some four or five miles each way. With poor roading between the towns, ships captains and agents had to undertake multiple journeys by foot or by horse and cart to register cargoes and pay their duties in weathers fair and foul. After years of appealing Grangemouth was granted its own Customhouse and a fine three storied stone building was erected on the Northern side of the harbour.

The 1830s saw 750 ships in port and over 3,000 trade journeys using the canal. The local shipyard had a graving or drydock built by the Earl of Zetland in 1811 and commenced building larger and larger vessels. The harbour and the river were unable to handle the volume of shipping and larger vessels had to rely completely on the tide to reach wharves on the river bank. A new dock was commissioned to be built and dredging and further re-alignment of the River Carron were undertaken. 200 men dug out what is now called the Old Dock and lock gates were built, allowing vessels to enter the port at any time and tide. A canal link to the south west was named Junction lock and it was also connected to the canal. This allowed timber logs from Scandinavia to be floated in rafts right up to the sawmills almost a mile inland.
Over the next 50 years the docks would be increased in size fourfold or more with a major land reclamation in the late 1890s pushing the entrance of the docks to the River Forth and avoiding the Carron with its limited depth and width. There was also Grangemouth Dockyard Company established in 1885. Grangemouth Town Hall was designed by William Black and was completed the same year.

In November 1914 the Admiralty requisitioned Grangemouth Docks and they were banned to merchant shipping for the remaining duration of the First World War. During this period the dock was referred to as HMS &quot;Rameses&quot; in military circles.

A 1936 LMS advert said that the docks had of water (excluding timber basins), direct access to the Forth and Clyde Canal (&quot;giving through access to Glasgow and the Clyde&quot;) and handled 3,250,000 tons of goods a year. The now re-opened canal no longer passes through the old part of Grangemouth, but joins the tidal River Carron. The Municipal Buildings were designed by Robert Wilson and David Tait and completed in 1937.

The original two townships were almost totally demolished in the 1960s as a result of poor planning decisions. The last vestiges of the original old town were the Queens Hotel and the Institute Building (built 1876) which were demolished at that time.

==Economy==
Grangemouth Port is one of the main ports in the UK with the largest container terminal in Scotland, with 9 million tonnes of cargo handled through the dock facilities each year. There are links to the inter-modal freight facilities elsewhere in the town which use the town&#x27;s motorway connections.

The main industry of Grangemouth and the wider Falkirk council area is focused on the Grangemouth Refinery which employs a significant workforce and is one of the largest of its kind in Europe.

The Soap Works building which was used to manufacture soap and glycerine, and owned by the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society was established in 1897. This was the largest works of its kind in Scotland and employed a considerable number of local people. It was demolished in November 2005 to make way for a new Whyte &amp; Mackay blending and bottling plant.

Grangemouth has an Air Training Corps Squadron, 1333 (Grangemouth) Squadron (located at the TA Centre in Central Avenue), an Army Cadet Detachment (also in Central Avenue) and a Sea and Marine cadet corps at Grangemouth Docks.

There are two general health practices, and a dentist&#x27;s surgery in the town. The area is covered by NHS Forth Valley and with the recent downgrading of the Falkirk and Stirling Hospitals, all major services have been transferred to the newly built Forth Valley Royal Hospital in nearby Larbert.

==Education==
Grangemouth has four primary schools: Bowhouse Primary School, Beancross Primary School, Moray Primary School and Sacred Heart R.C. Primary School. The former three are within the catchment area of Grangemouth High School and the latter is a catchment primary school for St. Mungo&#x27;s High School. Grangemouth High School was recently rebuilt with new facilities such as an indoor swimming pool, dance studio, a gym, and an outdoor football pitch. For many years Grangemouth had a three-tier school system - the only area in Scotland to do so. This ended in 1988.

==Transport==
Grangemouth has access to three nearby railway stations: Falkirk High, Falkirk Grahamston and Polmont.

==Culture==
===Recreation===
Grangemouth has an international-standard sports stadium and sports centre. Grangemouth Stadium was built in 1966 for the citizens of Grangemouth, partly funded by BP. The stadium has been extended to host a 150-metre running track, physio room, and weight-lifting. The stadium is used as the National Indoor Sports Stadium and for the Football Referees&#x27; Fitness Test for Stirlingshire. It was announced in August 2014 that the temporary running track used at Hampden Park for the athletics programme at the 2014 Commonwealth Games would be installed at Grangemouth Stadium. The Games legacy programme also agreed to donate £30,000 worth of sports equipment to Falkirk Community Trust, which runs the stadium.
A number of parks exist in the town which are used for sports and recreational activities. &quot;Inchyra Park&quot;, which is situated close to the stadium, Rannoch Park in the Bowhouse area which is situated at the point where the Grange Burn flows into the town, and &quot;Zetland Park&quot; in the centre of the town. Grangemouth Golf Club is actually located in the neighbouring village of Polmont.

===Football===
The town has many amateur football teams, including Zetland AFC and Bowhouse F.C.

Falkirk Juniors, who were established in 2011, played their home fixtures at the Grangemouth Stadium before folding in 2016. They competed in the Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region.

===Religion===
Many churches are located in Grangemouth: three Church of Scotland, two Catholic Churches, one Episcopal Church and several mission-type churches including a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The nearest Mosque is Falkirk Islamic Centre.

===Attractions===
The Kelpies and The Helix both stand between Grangemouth and Falkirk.

==Twin towns==
Grangemouth is twinned with La Porte, Indiana, US.

==Burials==

Grangemouth Cemetery, officially called Grandsable Cemetery lies south of the town, closer to Polmont.

The CNR formerly included the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ) until mid June 2023.

It is a member of the Progressive Alliance (PA), which was founded in 2013, Socialist International (SI), and the Party of European Socialists (PES). As of 2015, the PSD had 530,000 members.

PSD traces its origins to the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), a leftist breakaway group established in 1992 from the centre-left National Salvation Front (FSN) established after 1989. In 1993, this merged with three other parties to become the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (, PDSR), also translated as the Social Democracy Party of Romania. The present name was adopted after a merger with the smaller Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR) in 2001.

Since its formation, it has always been one of the two dominant parties of the country. The PDSR governed Romania from 1992 to 1996, while the PSDR was a junior coalition partner between 1996 and 2000. The merged PSD was the senior party in the coalitions governing from 2000 to 2004, and from March 2014 to November 2015, as well as one of the main coalition partners between December 2008 and October 2009 (with the Democratic Liberal Party, PDL) and again between May 2012 and March 2014 (as part of the Social Liberal Union, USL). PSD left government after former prime minister, Victor Ponta resigned in November 2015, only for PSD to return as the senior governing party in January 2017, shortly after it achieved a major victory in the 2016 Romanian legislative election. The party remained in power at governmental level until 2019, before being voted down in the parliament and then endorsing a PNL minority government between 2019 and 2020. Subsequently, it entered opposition between 2020 and 2021, before eventually returning to government within the CNR coalition in late 2021.

Party founder Ion Iliescu is the only PSD candidate to become President of Romania, he served in office from the 1989 to 1996, and again from 2000 to 2004.

Currently, PSD remains the largest party in the Parliament of Romania with initially 36 seats in the Senate of Romania and 86 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (as obtained at the 2024 Romanian legislative election), it also has the largest number of mayors, as well as the second largest number of local and county councillors and county presidents (after PNL), remaining the biggest and most influential political force in the country to the present day.

== History ==

Following the 27–29 May 1992 Convention of the National Salvation Front (, FSN) when Petre Roman became President of the Party, former Party Leader Ion Iliescu and his group of supporters withdrew from FSN and founded the Democratic National Salvation Front (, FDSN) while the rest of FSN was renamed as the Democratic Party (Romanian: Partidul Democrat) in May 1993.

During its first National Conference on the 28th of June 1992, FDSN decided on endorsing Ion Iliescu in the 1992 Romanian general election, which they later won and went on to govern Romania until 1996. On 10 July 1993, it took the name of Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) upon merger with the Socialist Democratic Party of Romania, the Republican Party, and the Cooperative Party.

From 1992 to 1996, the PDSR ruled in coalition with the Romanian National Unity Party (PUNR) and Greater Romania Party (PRM), and the left-wing Socialist Party of Labour (PSM), nicknemed by the Press as the Red Quadrilateral. The PUNR had ministers in the cabinet chaired by Nicolae Văcăroiu from March 1992 to September 1996. The PRM was not present at the cabinet-level but was given some posts in the state administration but which it retracted when it left the coalition in 1995.

PDSR went into opposition after the 1996 Romanian general election, which was won by the right-wing coalition Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR).

After four years of governmental turmoil and economic downfall, poorly managed by the crumbling CDR, saw PDSR making a fulminant comeback, winning the 2000 Romanian general election, this time in a coalition named the Social Democratic Pole of Romania (PDSR) along with the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR, who was part of the government from 1996 to 2000, as a member of the Social Democratic Union, now led by Alexandru Athanasiu) and the Romanian Humanist Party (PUR). The PSDR merged with PDSR on 16 June 2001, and the resulting party took the PSD name, with PDSR/PSD leader Adrian Năstase becoming prime minister. The centre-left Democratic Party (PD) was also invited by both Athanasiu and Năstase to join the new PSD, but PD president Traian Băsescu refused to take part in the merger. A controversial figure due to the corruption scandals in which he and his party were involved, Năstase is still regarded by both admirers and rivals (including his archrival Traian Băsescu), as the best and most efficient Romanian post-communist Prime Minister, being praised for his efforts of Euro-Atlantic integration of Romania and for the stabilization and modernization of the Romanian economy.

In November 2004, Adrian Năstase, the PSD candidate and incumbent Prime Minister of Romania, won the first round of the presidential elections but did not have a majority and had to go to a second round of voting, which he narrowly lost to Traian Băsescu of the opposition Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), who became Romania&#x27;s 4th president. In the 2004 Romanian general election, the PSD gained the largest share of the vote but because it did not have a majority, the other parties that managed to enter parliament, UDMR/RMDSZ and PUR, abandoned their respective pre-electoral agreements with the PSD and joined the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), mainly at the pressure of Băsescu. Mircea Geoană was elected president of the party in April 2005 by delegates at a PSD Party Congress held in Bucharest. His victory represented a surprise defeat for Iliescu, who was expected to defeat Geoană with ease. On 17 April 2008, the PSD and the PC announced they would form a political alliance for the 2008 Romanian local elections.

In February 2010, the Congress elected Victor Ponta as president after Geoană lost the 2009 Romanian presidential election. On 5 February 2011, the PSD formed a political alliance known as the Social Liberal Union (USL) with the PC and the National Liberal Party (PNL). The USL was disbanded on 25 February 2014 with exit of the PNL, which entered the opposition.

In July 2015, Liviu Dragnea was elected by the Congress of the PSD as the new president of the party, with 97% of the votes from the members. He was elected as leader after the former prime minister Victor Ponta stepped down on 12 July 2015 following charges of corruption that were later dropped. On 12 April 2019, the PSD was suspended from the Party of European Socialists (PES) following concerns about judicial reforms of the Dăncilă Cabinet. In May 2019, after Liviu Dragnea&#x27;s jailing, Viorica Dăncilă was elected by the Congress of the PSD as the new president of the party.

After being ousted from power in October 2019, the PSD also lost the 2019 Romanian presidential election. Such decline sent shockwase across the European Union (EU), especially the PES, as it resulted in their loss of power within von der Leyen Commission. Nonetheless, Daniel Hegedüs posited that this could be a win for both the PES and the wider European left, as the PES would regain credibility because &quot;mounting authoritarianism in Hungary and Poland has suffered under the burden of PSD&#x27;s rule-of-law record&quot;. In addition, Hegedüs noted the fact that this could represent another chance for the PSD to reform itself and change its ways.

In August 2020, Marcel Ciolacu became president of the party (after having previously served for this position only as &quot;ad interim&quot; between November 2019 and August 2020). During the same month, the PSD was willing to vote a motion of no confidence against the second Orban cabinet. Shortly after December 2020, while still the largest party in the wake of the 2020 Romanian legislative election, the PSD suffered significant political capital losses (as they previously did in the 2020 Romanian local elections as well) given the chaotic and negative governmental activity the party was responsible for during the former legislature (more specifically during the years 2017 and 2019), yet remained the biggest parliamentary opposition well up until the end of 2021.

During the 2021 Romanian political crisis, the PSD was again willing to have such a vote, this time against the Cîțu Cabinet, which it subsequently did, thereby contributing to its final dismissal. In November 2021, successful negotiations with the PNL led the PSD closer to returning government in the incumbent Ciucă Cabinet within a grand coalition government known as the &quot;National Coalition for Romania&quot; (or &quot;CNR&quot; for short). The PSD is still governing Romania as of early 2022, albeit with major tensions in the said grand coalition. The coalition has been described as authoritarian conservative.

In November 2022, the PSD agreed with the Moldovan European Social Democratic Party (PSDE) to begin a strategic partnership.

== Ideology and platform ==

Like its counterpart national-level members of the Party of European Socialists (PES), the PSD has a centre-left outlook and has been described as governing as centre-left, but has also been described as pragmatic, owing to its syncretic politics. The party has been described as social democratic, social conservative, economic nationalist, left-wing nationalist, and left-wing populist. The PSD was formed as a result of the merger of the Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), which had an internationalist social-democratic ideology, with the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR), whose governance was marked by a combination of social democracy, democratic socialism, labourism, pragmatism, left-wing populism, and nationalism. The 2003 absorption of the Socialist Party of Labour (PSM) and the Socialist Party of the National Renaissance (PSRN) led to the strengthening of the left-wing nationalism component within the party. Until 2021 unlike the majority of Western European PES party members and as other like-minded centre-left, social democratic parties in Central and Eastern European post-Communism, it has taken a more soft Eurosceptic outlook, though it is neutral in regards to European integration. PSD stated that it endorses EU and NATO membership. The party is more conservative than PES when it comes to social issues, reflecting the country&#x27;s social-conservative outlook, including in its centre-right counterpart, the National Liberal Party (PNL).

The party has been described as having centre-left rhetoric and economic policies, while being more conservative on personal and ethical matters. According to Florin Poenaru, &quot;the movement led by Ion Iliescu was from the very beginning the party of local capitalists and not of the industrial proletariat. ... PSD was the party that aggregated the interests of the autochthonous capitalists, but whose electoral basis was the former industrial proletariat.&quot; Poenaru states that PSD never said no to the neoliberal agenda but applied it rather slowly. Andrei Pleșu once stated that the main post-Communist Romanian parties do not act according to some ideology or doctrine.

Political analyst Radu Magdin said that the PSD is &quot;a catch-all party: its values are conservative, its economic policy is liberal and it has a social, left-leaning rhetoric when it comes to public policies.&quot; An example is their calls for both tax cuts and pensions and wages increase in 2016. Its more conservative outlook is owed to the social-conservative nature of post-Communist countries, and has been adopted by both the centre-left (PSD) and the centre-right (PNL). For Cornel Ban, Assistant Professor of International Relations at the Pardee School of Boston University, the PSD is an anomaly in Eastern Europe in that it was an ideal playground for right-wing populist parties but has seen the political left routinely win; this was in part because the political right and far-right were in government, including at the local level, during the post-Communist slumps which remained in the mind of many voters. Journalist Jean-Baptiste Chastand said that the PSD-led pro-European government in Romania took a national conservative turn. The historian Ioan Stanomir stated that PSD is a conservative party, that has nothing to do with the left, while journalist Bogdan Tiberiu Iacob described the party as progressive-conservative. PSD also opposed the mandatory refugee quotas. Journalist Daniel Mihăilescu labeled the party as national populist. Deutsche Welle stated that, unlike most European Social-democratic parties, PSD is against social progressivism and is strongly conservative. Journalist and philosipher Andrei Cornea also stated that PSD is not a social-democratic party, but a patrimonial-conservative one, structured around vassalism and clientelism, whose essential electoral pool is formed by a poor, ignorant and especially devoid of civic conscience. PSD has also ethno-nationalist factions. Under Dragnea&#x27;s leadership, PSD has been described as national populist and sovereigntist. The PopuList labeled PSD under Victor Ponta and Liviu Dragnea as ultranationalist.

In regards to LGBT rights, in general, PSD opposes the recognition of same-sex marriages and civil partnerships. However, in 2018, then PSD president Liviu Dragnea hinted that PSD could support the recognition the civil partnership. Also, in January 2001, it was the PSD-dominated Adrian Năstase&#x27;s government that adopted the Emergency Ordinance no. 89/2001, which eliminated Art. 200 of the Penal Code and adjusted other articles referring to sex offences to avoid discriminatory treatment of offenders, thus legalising same-sex relations. This ordinance came into force in January 2002, after President Ion Iliescu (the founder of PSD) signed the new law. However, the current president of the Social Democrats, Marcel Ciolacu, is a strong opponent to the recognition of same-sex marriage and the civil partnership.

The party has strong connections with the Romanian Orthodox Church (BOR), reflecting the party&#x27;s social conservatism.

== Controversies ==

Political opponents have criticised PSD for harbouring former Romanian Communist Party (PCR) officials, and for allegedly attempting to control the Romanian mass media. By 2009, a number of its incumbent or former senior members have also been accused of corruption, interfering in the judiciary and using their political positions for personal enrichment. As of 2015, founding member Ion Iliescu is facing prosecution on charges of crimes against humanity for his role in the June 1990 Mineriad, while former president Liviu Dragnea was convicted for electoral fraud and for instigation to the abuse of public office and being indicted for forming an &quot;organised criminal group&quot; in 2018. That same year, former president Victor Ponta had also been investigated for corruption but was ultimately acquitted. Adrian Năstase temporarily self-suspended himself from the position on 16 January 2006, pending investigation of a scandal provoked by his wealth declaration, where he was accused of corruption. Alleged text transcripts of PSD meetings surfaced on an anonymous website just before the 2004 Romanian general election. Năstase and his ministers are shown talking about political involvement in corruption trials of the government&#x27;s members, or involvement in suppressing &quot;disobedient&quot; media. Năstase stated that the transcripts were fake, but several party members, including former PSD president and former foreign minister Mircea Geoană, have said they are genuine, though Geoană later retracted his statement. Security expert Iulian Fota stated that PSD is a neocommunist anti-Western party backed by Russia.

Politicians of the party have occasionally employed &quot;utilitarian anti-Semitism&quot;, meaning that politicians who may usually not be antisemites played off certain antisemitic prejudices in order to serve their political necessities. On 5 March 2012, PSD Senator Dan Șova, at that time the party spokesman, said on &quot;The Money Channel&quot; that &quot;no Jew suffered on Romanian territory, thanks to marshal Antonescu.&quot; Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania expressed its deep disagreement and indignation over the statements of the spokesman of the party. Following public outcry, Șova retracted his statement and issued a public apology; nevertheless, the chairman of the party, Victor Ponta, announced his removal from the office of party spokesman.

Between 2017 and 2019, the party, along with its former junior coalition partners, more specifically the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE) and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ), had unsuccessfully tried to pass a series of tremendously controversial laws related to the judicial system. In a 2018 preliminary opinion, the Venice Commission stated that the changes could severely undermine the independence of judges and prosecutors in Romania. This unsuccessful endeavour committed by the former PSD–ALDE coalition was the basis for the nationwide 2017–2019 Romanian protests, the largest in the country&#x27;s entire history thus far.

<text>The Day After Tomorrow is a 2004 American science fiction disaster film conceived, co-written, co-produced, and directed by Roland Emmerich, based on the 1999 book &quot;The Coming Global Superstorm&quot; by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber, and starring Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sela Ward, Emmy Rossum, and Ian Holm. The film depicts catastrophic climatic effects following the disruption of the North Atlantic Ocean circulation, in which a series of extreme weather events usher in climate change and lead to a new ice age.

Originally slated for release in the summer of 2003, it premiered in Mexico City on May 17, 2004, and was theatrically released in the United States by 20th Century Fox on May 28, 2004. The film was a commercial success, grossing $552 million worldwide against a production budget of $125 million, becoming so the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2004. Filmed in Montreal, it was the highest-grossing Hollywood film made in Canada at its time of release. The film was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film and Best Special Effects at the Saturn Awards.

==Plot==
Jack Hall is an American paleoclimatologist, and as he and his colleagues Frank and Jason drill for ice-core samples in the Larsen Ice Shelf for the NOAA, the ice shelf splits away. At a UN conference in New Delhi, Jack discusses his research showing that climate change could cause an ice age, but US Vice President Raymond Becker dismisses his concerns. Professor Terry Rapson, an oceanographer of the Hedland Centre in Scotland, befriends Jack over his views of an inevitable climate shift.

Tokyo is struck by a giant hailstorm, and astronauts from the International Space Station spot three gigantic superstorms above Canada, Europe, and Siberia. Rapson&#x27;s team in Scotland begin noticing severe temperature drops from multiple buoys from the North Atlantic realizing Jack&#x27;s theories were correct, but the climate shift is happening too fast. 

Remnants of a hurricane spawn a destructive tornado outbreak over the L.A. Basin. Also, three helicopters sent to rescue the British royal family from Balmoral Castle crash in Scotland after they fly into their superstorm&#x27;s eye. 

Jack&#x27;s and Rapson&#x27;s teams, along with NASA meteorologist Janet Tokada, build a forecast model based on Jack&#x27;s research discovering the impact of climate change will happen in 6–8 weeks (later discovered as being 7–10 days). Rapson notifies Jack that siphoned air from the upper troposphere flash freezes anything caught in the eyes of the cyclones with temperatures below which explains the helicopter crash.

In New York City Jack&#x27;s son Sam, along with his friends Brian and Laura, participate in an academic decathlon, where they make a new friend, J.D. The North American superstorm creates strong winds and rain that flood Manhattan in knee-deep water. All transportation halts, stranding the city population. 

A massive storm surge inundates the city, forcing Sam&#x27;s group to seek shelter at the New York Public Library. While helping to rescue two French-speaking tourists in distress from a cab with a police officer, Laura badly cuts her leg. Sam is able to contact Jack and his mother Lucy, a pediatrician, through a working payphone. Jack warns Sam of the exacerbating superstorm and urges him to stay inside and warm and promises to rescue him. Rapson and his team succumb to the European storm. Lucy remains in her hospital caring for bedridden patients, where the authorities eventually rescue them.

Upon Jack&#x27;s suggestion, President Blake orders the populations of the southern states to be evacuated into Mexico, while those in the northern ones are warned by the government to seek shelter and stay warm. Jack, Jason, and Frank make their way to NYC. In Pennsylvania, Frank falls through the skylight of a mall covered in snow and sacrifices himself by cutting his rope to prevent his friends from also falling in.

In the library, most survivors set out to join the southern states&#x27; refugees once the floodwater freezes, despite Sam&#x27;s warnings. In Mexico, Becker learns that Blake&#x27;s motorcade perished in the superstorm. 
Laura develops sepsis from her injury, whereupon Sam, Brian, and J.D. scour an abandoned Russian cargo ship that drifted into the city before the water froze for penicillin and supplies. When they find them, they also encounter a pack of escaped wolves from the Central Park Zoo. The boys fend off the wolves and make it back to the library with what they need as the eye of the North American superstorm passes over and freezes Manhattan. Jack and Jason take shelter in an abandoned restaurant.

Days later, the superstorms dissipate. After finding people outside frozen to death, including those from the library who tried to escape, Jack and Jason reach the library, finding Sam&#x27;s group alive. Jack sends a radio message to US forces in Mexico.

In his first address as the new president from the US embassy in Mexico, Becker apologizes on The Weather Channel for his ignorance and sends helicopters to rescue survivors including Jack and Sam&#x27;s group in the northern states. On the International Space Station, astronauts look down in awe at Earth&#x27;s transformed surface, now with ice sheets extending across much of the Northern Hemisphere, remarking that the air never looked so clear.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
&quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; was inspired by &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; talk-radio host Art Bell and Whitley Strieber&#x27;s book, &quot;The Coming Global Superstorm&quot;, and Strieber wrote the film&#x27;s novelization. To choose a studio, writer Michael Wimer created an auction, with a copy of the script being sent to all major studios along with a term sheet. They had a 24-hour window to decide whether to produce the movie with Roland Emmerich directing, and Fox Studios was the only studio to accept the terms.

===Filming===
&quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; was filmed predominantly in Montreal and Toronto, with some footage also shot in New York City and Chiyoda, Tokyo. Filming ran from November 7, 2002, until October 18, 2003.

===Visual effects===
&quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; features 416 visual effects shots, with nine effects houses, notably Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), and Digital Domain, and over 1,000 artists, working on the film for over a year.

Although a miniature set was initially considered according to the behind-the-scenes documentary, for the destruction of New York, effects artists instead utilized a 13-block-sized, LIDAR-scanned 3D model of Manhattan, with over 50,000 scanned photographs used for building textures. Due to its overall complexity and a tight schedule, the storm surge scene required as many as three special effects vendors for certain shots, with the digital water created by either Digital Domain or small effects house Tweak Films, depending on the shot. Miniatures were employed for a later underwater scene in which a city bus is crushed under the bulb stern of an abandoned Russian tanker ship that had drifted inland.

Similarly, the opening flyover of Antarctica was also CGI, created by digitally scanning miniature iceberg models created out of sculpted styrofoam; the falling pieces of ice as the shelf cracks were entirely hand-animated. Running for approximately two and a half minutes in length, the scene was at the time the longest continuous all-CGI shot in film history, surpassing the space zoom-out from the opening of &quot;Contact&quot; (1997).

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
The Day After Tomorrow (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack of the film. It was released on May 18, 2004.

==Release==
The film had its world premiere in Mexico City in May 17, 2004. It was released to theaters in the United States on May 28, 2004.

===Home media===

The film was released on VHS and DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on October 12, 2004, and was released in high-definition video on Blu-ray in North America on October 2, 2007, and in the United Kingdom on April 28, 2008, in 1080p with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio track and few bonus features. DVD sales were $110 million, bringing the film&#x27;s gross to $652,771,772.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film came in second at the US box office behind &quot;Shrek 2&quot; over its four-day Memorial Day opening and grossed $85,807,341. For twenty years, it would hold the record for having the highest opening weekend for a natural disaster film until 2024 when it was dethroned by &quot;Twisters&quot;. It led the per-theater average, with a four-day average of $25,053 (compared to &quot;Shrek 2&quot; four-day average of $22,633). 
At the end of its theatrical run, the film had grossed $186,740,799 domestically and $552,639,571 worldwide. It was the second-highest opening-weekend film not to lead at the box office; &quot;Inside Out&quot; surpassed it in June 2015.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, 45% of 219 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; is a ludicrous popcorn thriller filled with clunky dialogue, but spectacular visuals save it from being a total disaster.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described the film as &quot;profoundly silly&quot;, but nonetheless said the film was effective and praised the special effects. He gave it three stars out of four. Mark Caro of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote a completely negative review which considered the film unworthy of publicity for the climate change debate it had created.

===Accolades===
==Political and scientific criticism==
Emmerich did not deny that his casting of a weak president and the resemblance of Kenneth Welsh to Vice President Dick Cheney were intended to criticize the climate change policy of the George W. Bush administration. Responding to claims of insensitivity in his inclusion of scenes of a devastated New York City less than three years after the September 11 attacks, Emmerich said that it was necessary to showcase the increased unity of people in the face of disaster because of the attacks.

Some scientists criticized the film&#x27;s scientific aspects. Paleoclimatologist and professor of earth and planetary science at Harvard University Daniel P. Schrag said, &quot;On the one hand, I&#x27;m glad that there&#x27;s a big-budget movie about something as critical as climate change. On the other, I&#x27;m concerned that people will see these over-the-top effects and think the whole thing is a joke ... We are indeed experimenting with the Earth in a way that hasn&#x27;t been done for millions of years. But you&#x27;re not going to see another ice age – at least not like that.&quot; J. Marshall Shepherd, a research meteorologist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, expressed a similar sentiment: &quot;I&#x27;m heartened that there&#x27;s a movie addressing real climate issues. But as for the science of the movie, I&#x27;d give it a D minus or an F. And I&#x27;d be concerned if the movie was made to advance a political agenda.&quot; According to University of Victoria climatologist Andrew Weaver, &quot;It&#x27;s &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; of climate science movies, but I&#x27;m not losing any sleep over a new ice age, because it&#x27;s impossible.&quot;

Patrick J. Michaels, a former research professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia and fellow at the Cato Institute who rejected the scientific consensus on global warming, called the film &quot;propaganda&quot; in a &quot;USA Today&quot; editorial: &quot;As a scientist, I bristle when lies dressed up as &#x27;science&#x27; are used to influence political discourse.&quot; College instructor and retired NASA Office of Inspector General senior special agent Joseph Gutheinz called &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; &quot;a cheap thrill ride, which many weak-minded people will jump on and stay on for the rest of their lives&quot; in a &quot;Space Daily&quot; editorial.

Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, an expert on thermohaline circulation and its effect on climate, said after a talk with scriptwriter Jeffrey Nachmanoff at the film&#x27;s Berlin preview:

Clearly this is a disaster movie and not a scientific documentary, [and] the film makers have taken a lot of artistic license. But the film presents an opportunity to explain that some of the basic background is right: humans are indeed increasingly changing the climate and this is quite a dangerous experiment, including some risk of abrupt and unforeseen changes ... Luckily it is extremely unlikely that we will see major ocean circulation changes in the next couple of decades (I&#x27;d be just as surprised as Jack Hall if they did occur); at least most scientists think this will only become a more serious risk towards the end of the century. And the consequences would certainly not be as dramatic as the &#x27;superstorm&#x27; depicted in the movie. Nevertheless, a major change in ocean circulation is a risk with serious and partly unpredictable consequences, which we should avoid. And even without events like ocean circulation changes, climate change is serious enough to demand decisive action.

Environmental activist and &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist George Monbiot called &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; &quot;a great movie and lousy science&quot;.

In 2008, Yahoo! Movies listed &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; as one of its top-10 scientifically inaccurate films. It was criticized for depicting meteorological phenomena as occurring over the course of hours, instead of decades or centuries. A 2015 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article reported on a paper published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; which indicated that global temperatures could drop relatively rapidly ( over an 11-year period) due to a temporary shutdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation caused by global warming.

<text>Gottfried Feder (27 January 1883 – 24 September 1941) was a German civil engineer, a self-taught economist, and one of the early key members of the Nazi Party and its economic theoretician. One of his lectures, delivered on 12 September 1919, drew Adolf Hitler into the party.

== Early life and education ==
Feder was born in Würzburg on 27 January 1883, the son of civil servant Hans Feder and Mathilde Feder (née Luz). After being taught in a classical Gymnasium first in Ansbach and then in Munich, he studied engineering in Berlin and Zürich. He founded a construction company in 1908 that became particularly active in Bulgaria where it built a number of official buildings.

Feder claimed that he studied financial politics and economics on his own from 1917 onward. But there is no evidence to back up this claim. He developed a hostility towards wealthy bankers during World War I and wrote a &quot;manifesto on breaking the shackles of interest&quot; (&quot;Brechung der Zinsknechtschaft&quot;) in 1919. This was soon followed by the founding of a &quot;task force&quot; dedicated to those goals that demanded a nationalisation of all banks and an abolition of interest.

That year, Feder, together with Anton Drexler, Dietrich Eckart and Karl Harrer, were involved in the founding of the &quot;Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot; (German Workers&#x27; Party-DAP). Adolf Hitler met him in the summer of 1919 while he was in an anti-Bolshevik training course at Munich university—funded by the army and organized by Major Karl Mayr—and Feder became his mentor in finance and economics. He helped to inspire Hitler&#x27;s opposition to &quot;Jewish finance capitalism.&quot; Delivering political courses alongside Feder was Karl Alexander von Müller (son of Bavaria&#x27;s Culture Minister) who spotted Hitler&#x27;s oratorical ability and forwarded his name as a political instructor for the army—an important step in Hitler&#x27;s career.

== 1920s politics ==
In February 1920, together with Adolf Hitler and Anton Drexler, Feder drafted the &quot;25 points&quot; which summed up the party&#x27;s views and introduced his own anti-capitalist views into the program. When the paper was announced on 24 February 1920, more than 2,000 people attended the rally. In an attempt to make the party more broadly appealing to larger segments of the population, the DAP was renamed in February 1920 to the &quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot; (National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party, NSDAP), more commonly known as the Nazi Party.

Feder took part in the party&#x27;s Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923. After Hitler&#x27;s arrest, he remained one of the leaders of the now outlawed Party and was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; in 1924 under the banner of the Nazi front organization, the National Socialist Freedom Movement. In 1928, after the ban on the Nazi Party was lifted, he was elected as one of the first 12 Nazi deputies. He served until 1936 representing the electoral constituencies of Chemnitz-Zwickau (1924-1932), Leipzig (1932-1933) and East Prussia (1933-1936). As a &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputy, he demanded the freezing of interest rates and dispossession of Jewish citizens. He remained one of the leaders of the anti-capitalistic wing of the NSDAP, and published several papers, including &quot;National and social bases of the German state&quot; (1920), &quot;Das Programm der NSDAP und seine weltanschaulichen Grundlagen&quot; (&quot;The programme of the NSDAP and its ideological foundations&quot; 1927) and &quot;Was will Adolf Hitler?&quot; (&quot;What does Adolf Hitler want?&quot;, 1931).

In early 1926, Feder played a key role in assisting Hitler to overcome the challenge to his authority presented by the National Socialist Working Association. This was a short-lived group of northern and western German &quot;Gauleiter&quot;, organized in September 1925 and led by Gregor Strasser, which unsuccessfully sought to amend the &quot;25 Points.&quot; Around Christmas 1925, Feder obtained a copy of the proposed revision and informed Hitler of it. As a coauthor of the original 1920 program, Feder felt protective of it and was furious that an attempt to amend it was underway without his or Hitler&#x27;s knowledge. At a meeting of the Working Association in Hanover on 24 January 1926, Feder attended, uninvited but as Hitler&#x27;s representative. The meeting became contentious with Joseph Goebbels, one of the Working Association leaders, demanding that Feder be ejected, shouting: &quot;We don&#x27;t want any stool pigeons!&quot; However, a vote was taken and Feder was allowed to participate. The draft program was vigorously debated with Feder raising objections on various points. In the end, the Strasser draft was not approved. Shortly afterward, on 14 February, Hitler called a leadership meeting known as the Bamberg Conference where he forcefully opposed the positions advocated by the Working Association and insisted that the original program be retained intact. Strasser was made to retrieve all copies of the draft program that had been distributed. Hitler reasserted his authority as supreme Party leader and stamped out any potential threat from the Working Association, which faded into irrelevance and was formally dissolved later in the year.

Feder briefly dominated the Nazi Party&#x27;s official views on financial politics, but after he became chairman of the party&#x27;s economic council in 1931, his anti-capitalist views led to a great decline in financial support from Germany&#x27;s major industrialists. Following pressure from Albert Vögler, Gustav Krupp, Friedrich Flick, Fritz Thyssen, Emil Kirdorf and especially Hjalmar Schacht, Hitler decided to move the party away from Feder&#x27;s economic views. Schacht wrote in the &#x27;Magic of Money&#x27; that &quot;National Socialist agitiation under the leadership of Gottfried Feder&quot; aimed to curtail &quot;private banking&quot; and &quot;the entire currency system.&quot; He further explained that the goal of Feder and his pupils was to destroy their entire &quot;banking and monetary economy&quot; and concludes that he &quot;had to try to steer Hitler away from these destruction conceptions.&quot; (p. 154) When Hitler became &quot;Reichskanzler&quot; in 1933, he appointed Feder as State Secretary at the Reich Ministry of Economics in July, an appointment that disappointed Feder, who had hoped for a much higher position.

== Nazi Germany ==
Feder continued to write papers, putting out &quot;Kampf gegen die Hochfinanz&quot; (&quot;The Fight against high finance&quot;, 1933) and the antisemitic &quot;Die Juden&quot; (&quot;The Jews,&quot; 1933). In 1939 he wrote &quot;Die Neue Stadt&quot; (the New City). This can be considered an attempt at Garden City building through the use of Nazi architecture. Here he proposed creating agricultural cities of 20,000 people divided into nine autonomous units and surrounded by agricultural areas. Each city was to be fully autonomous and self-sufficient, with detailed plans for daily living and urban amenities provided. Unlike other garden city theorists, he believed that urban areas could be reformed by subdividing the existing built environment into self-sufficient neighborhoods. This idea of creating clusters of self-contained neighbourhoods forming a mid-sized city was popularised by Uzō Nishiyama in Japan. It would later be applied in the era of Japanese New Town construction.

However, despite its consistency with the blood and soil ideology of the Nazis, his concept of decentralized factories was successfully opposed by both generals and Junkers. Generals objected because it interfered with rearmament, and Junkers because it would prevent their exploiting their estates for the international market.

When Hjalmar Schacht took office as Minister of Economics on 2 August 1934, one of his first actions was to fire Feder from his State Secretary post. Feder then served as &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; for Settlement until December 1934. He also was a member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law. Feder ended up becoming Professor for Settlement Policy at the Technische Hochschule Berlin in December 1936, where he stayed until his death in Murnau, Bavaria, on 24 September 1941.

<text>Christopher E. Oroc, stage name Melvin Babu (born September 17, 1974), better known as DJ Babu or DJ Babu the Dilated Junkie, is a Filipino-American DJ and record producer. He is a member of DJ crew the Beat Junkies, Los Angeles-based hip hop trio Dilated Peoples together with Evidence and Rakaa Iriscience, and a member of the Likwit Junkies along with rapper Defari. He served as the curator and host of &quot;Soundcheck&quot; for Beat Junkie Radio on Dash Radio. As of 2017, DJ Babu is the Program Director and a lead instructor alongside fellow crew members Mr. Choc, Melo-D, DJ Rhettmatic, D-Styles and J.Rocc at the Beat Junkie Institute of Sound.

==Career==
In his early years, Babu lived in Oxnard, California for one year, and later moved to the neighboring city of Camarillo; he currently resides in Los Angeles County.

Babu started as part of the Beat Junkies DJ crew, joining in by late 1993. He has won multiple competition titles Including the Vestax World Championships and multiple International Turntablist Federation titles. He has appeared in and hosted numerable videos. Babu is famous for redefining the art of Beat juggling during the 1997 ITF/Beat juggling category competition, when he first performed his &quot;Blind Alley&quot; routine. Under the name &quot;The Turntablist&quot;, produced perhaps the genre&#x27;s most popular battle record, 1996&#x27;s Super Duck Breaks, which sold over 10,000 copies.

Along with rapper and record producer Evidence and rapper Rakaa, he released the debut Dilated Peoples&#x27; single &quot;Third Degree&quot; in 1997 for ABB Records. The trio&#x27;s dropped their first studio album, &quot;The Platform&quot;, in 2000. Babu, Evidence and Pharoahe Monch are featured in the song &quot;H! Vltg3&quot; from Linkin Park&#x27;s remix album &quot;Reanimation&quot;. DJ Babu has also featured on numerous acts alongside groups such as Jurassic 5, Swollen Members and the Visionaries. Individually Babu has been featured in many other groups, including his affiliation with the Likwit Crew, which led to form the Likwit Junkies duo with Defari. The duo&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;The L.J.&#x27;s&quot;, was released in March 2005 to generally favorable reviews from music critics.

Babu&#x27;s latest endeavors include Dilated Peoples&#x27; 2014 release of their fifth studio album, &quot;Directors of Photography&quot; via Rhymesayers Entertainment label, which features tracks that were primarily produced by Evidence and Babu, with guest appearances from Vince Staples, Aloe Blacc, Action Bronson, Sick Jacken and Rapsody to name a few.

In 2014, the Beat Junkies crew launched their own membership based record pool curated by the members of the crew, including Babu. At the top of 2015, &quot;Beat Junkie Radio&quot; began airing on Dash Radio, the station stars all members of the crew, but led by Babu, Mr. Choc, and Rhettmatic. Their live show &quot;Soundcheck&#x27; which aires live every 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month has been ranked as one of the top 5 shows on Dash Radio.

&quot;Duck Season Vol. 4&quot; is set to be released in 2018.

Aside Babu&#x27;s musical accomplishments, his hobbies also include photography, with Babu being noted for his &quot;behind the decks&quot; shots of his turntables with Evidence and Rakaa during live shows, as well as landscape shots of his travels around the world with Dilated Peoples.

On January 18, 2017, The Beat Junkies formally announced plans to open their own DJ school (The Beat Junkie Institute of Sound) and Professional training facility. Babu leads in the introductory classes, intermediate/advanced level scratching, creative mixing and beat juggling classes.

<doc id="407203" wikidata="Q1509365" url="?curid=407203" title="Gold franc">
<text>The gold franc (currency code: XFO) was the unit of account for the Bank for International Settlements from 1930 until 1 April 2003. It was replaced with the special drawing right. It was originally based on the Franc Germinal, and remained at the value the franc was pegged (0.290322 g fine gold) after the countries of the Latin Monetary Union came off the gold standard.

==Use in New Hebrides==
The gold franc was used in the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) as the currency in which the joint administration&#x27;s postal service denominated its stamps, a natural choice as the Universal Postal Union Treaty (beginning in 1874 when the first treaty was agreed and reaffirmed at subsequent Congresses until at least that of 1939—see the various &quot;Actes du Congress...&quot;) denominated the agreed international postal rates in gold franc and gold centime leaving each member country and its dependencies to translate the amounts into their own currencies. This added to the already confused situation in which the Australian dollar and the New Hebrides franc were used in normal trade (and in which even the pound sterling turned up in the columns of earlier joint administration budgetary documents).

==Swiss Gold Franc Initiative==
On 9 March 2011, a parliamentary initiative was introduced in the National Council of Switzerland to institute a gold franc as additional currency for Switzerland: 
This initiative was examined by the Committee for Economic Affairs and Taxation, which rejected it at the June meeting.

This gold franc would have been defined as 0.1 gram of fine gold. The initiative would not have removed, replaced or pegged the existing Swiss franc, therefore both the gold franc and the Swiss franc would have coexisted side-by-side. Due to the fixed metallic content of the gold franc, its exchange rate with the Swiss franc would have gone up and down according to market supply and demand, like any other free-floating currency.

The gold franc was intended to become a safe-haven currency, to divert international capital flows in times of financial crises away from the Swiss franc.

The gold franc would have been completely independent from the gold reserves of the Swiss National Bank. It would have been minted only by Swiss commercial banks, under the supervision of the Swiss Confederation. The backers of the gold franc hoped that its institution would have made it easier for small savers to invest in gold by reducing the minimum investment and trading unit.

<text>The Primary Atomic Reference Clock in Space or PARCS was an atomic-clock mission scheduled to fly on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2008, but cancelled to make way for the Vision for Space Exploration. The mission, to have been funded by NASA, involved a laser-cooled caesium atomic clock, and a time-transfer system using Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. PARCS was to fly concurrently with the Superconducting Microwave Oscillator (SUMO) a different type of clock that was to be compared against the PARCS clock to test certain theories. The objectives of the mission were to have been:

*Test gravitational theory
*Study laser-cooled atoms in microgravity
*Improve the accuracy of timekeeping on earth

==Experiment location==
The proposed ISS location for the experiment was on the External Facility of the Japanese Experimental Module (JEM). This location afforded good views of the GPS constellation of satellites, needed for comparing space and ground clocks. In addition, the volume, available power, and coolant system were well matched to the mission requirements.

==Goals==
The microgravity environment of space allows slowing of atoms to speeds well below those used in terrestrial atomic clocks, providing for substantial improvement in clock accuracy. This very accurate space clock will be compared continuously to the SUMO oscillator, and these two clocks (being fundamentally different) will provide a test of &quot;local position invariance.&quot; Comparisons between the space and earth clocks will yield a related, but important measurement of the gravitational frequency shift. Finally, the signals conveyed to the ground through the GPS time-transfer system will serve as a truly international time standard available to anyone on earth.

==Institutions and people==
PARCS is a cooperative effort between the following organizations:

*Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which contributed Flight Hardware Development
*National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which contributed Concept/Development Testing
*University of Colorado, which contributed Gravitational Testing

==Staff==
Bill Klipstein of JPL was the Project Scientist, and Dave Seidel of JPL was the Project Manager. The Co-Principal Investigators were Don Sullivan and Bill Phillips of NIST, and Neil Ashby of the University of Colorado. John Lipa of Stanford University was the Principal Investigator for SUMO and John Dick of JPL was the Project Scientist for that program.

<text>Bagram (; Pashto/) is a town and seat in Bagram District in Parwan Province of Afghanistan, about 60 kilometers north of the capital Kabul. It is the site of an ancient city located at the junction of the Ghorband and Panjshir Valley, near today&#x27;s city of Charikar, Afghanistan. The location of this historical town made it a key passage from Ancient India along the Silk Road, leading westwards through the mountains towards Bamiyan, and north over the Kushan Pass to the Baghlan Valley and past the Kushan archeological site at Surkh Kotal, to the commercial centre of Balkh and the rest of northern Afghanistan. Bagram was the capital of the Kushan Empire in the first century CE.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Bagram has a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dsa&quot;) with brief, but cold winters and long, hot and dry summers. Precipitation is most likely between the months of October and April. Dust storms and sand storms occur frequently during certain times of the year and the city is often blanketed by snow in winter months. The annual mean temperature is 

== History ==
===Ancient history===

The ancient city of Kapisi is identified with present-day Bagram. The figures of ancient Buddhist and Hindu sculptures show that the city was initially ruled by Indic people who have either migrated or intermingled with the Iranian populations who moved into the region like Kambojas from Bactria. 
While the Diadochi were warring amongst themselves, the Mauryan Empire was developing in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The founder of the empire, Chandragupta Maurya, confronted a Macedonian invasion force led by Seleucus I in 305 BC and following a brief conflict, an agreement was reached as Seleucus ceded Gandhara and Arachosia (centered on ancient Kandahar) and areas south of Bagram (corresponding to the extreme south-east of modern Afghanistan) to the Mauryans. During the 120 years of the Mauryans in southern Afghanistan, Buddhism was introduced and eventually become a major religion alongside Zoroastrianism and local pagan beliefs.

Bagram became the capital of the Kushan Empire in the first century. The &quot;Bagram treasure&quot; as it has been called, is indicative of intense commercial exchanges between all the cultural centers of the classical time, with the Kushan empire at the junction of the land and sea trade between the east and west. However, the works of art found in Bagram, such as the Begram ivories, are either quite purely Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese or Indian, with only little indications of the cultural syncretism found in Greco-Buddhist art.

===Islamic conquest===

The Islamic conquest of Afghanistan and the adjoining Pashtun region began in seventh century right after conquest of Persia. However, the complete Islamization of Afghanistan wasn&#x27;t achieved until the Ghaznavid rule. The modern-day town is believed to be founded by Babur at the site of the ancient city. In Babur&#x27;s memoirs, the &quot;Baburnama&quot;, the emphasis of his visit in 1519 is on the colony of Hindu ascetics at Gurh Kattri (Kur Katri), who fascinated him.

===Recent history===

Bagram hosts the strategic Bagram Airfield, from which most US air activity in Afghanistan took place. The runway was built in 1976, and it was a Soviet air base from 1979 to 1989. There was also a Provincial Reconstruction Team when the US were present in Afghanistan and implemented their counter-insurgency strategy.

Bagram is also the location of the Parwan Detention Facility; this detention facility was the last prison in Afghanistan under management of the US. It was handed back to the Afghan government on 25 March 2013. The detention centre had earlier come into the attention of the news media as it was claimed that prisoners were tortured (see the article Bagram torture and prisoner abuse). At the time of the hand-over of the facility, human-rights groups like Amnesty International have raised concerns about the treatment of prisoners there.

On December 21, 2015, Bagram was the site of a suicide bombing killing 6 people.

On July 1, 2021, US troops departed from the air base, abandoning the outpost over to the Afghan government after 20 years. According to the Afghan commander at the time, the US evacuated the base during the night without any previous official notice to the Afghan army.

<text>Transport today is mostly powered by fossil fuel. The reason for this is the ease of use and the existence of mature technologies harnessing this fuel source. Fossil fuels represent a concentrated, relatively compact source of energy. The drawbacks are that they are heavily polluting and rely on limited natural resources. There are many proposals to harness renewable forms of energy, to use fossil fuel more efficiently, or to use human power, or some hybrid of these, to move people and things.

The list below contains some [[Mode of transport|forms of transport]] not in general use, but considered as possibilities in the future.

== Proposed future transport ==
*Air-propelled train (abandoned in 19th century)
**Bounce tube pneumatic travel (Proposed by Robert A. Heinlein in 1956)
**Vactrain also known as ET3
*BiModal Glideway (Dual Mode Transportation System) travel (Proposed by William D. Davis, Jr. in 1967)
*TEV Project (proposed by Will Jones in Summer 2012)
*Dual-mode vehicle 
*Hyperloop
*Intelligent Transportation System

<doc id="407215" wikidata="Q262218" url="?curid=407215" title="Rachel Miner">
<text>Rachel Miner (born July 29, 1980) is an American actress. She made her feature film debut in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; (1990), and came to prominence with her portrayal of Michelle Bauer on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; (1990–1995). Her other film credits include &quot;Bully&quot; (2001), &quot;Haven&quot; (2004), &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; (both 2006), and &quot;In Their Skin&quot; (2012). Outside film, Miner is known for her recurring portrayals of Dani on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Californication&quot; (2007–2008), Dawn Trager on FX&#x27;s &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; (2011–2012), and Meg on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural&quot; (2009–2020).

==Background==
Miner is the daughter of director and producer Peter Miner and the granddaughter of director-producer Worthington Miner and actress Frances Fuller. She attended New York&#x27;s Professional Children&#x27;s School. In a 1993 interview, Miner named Jodie Foster as the actress she most admired, and expressed the hope that she might have the opportunity to tackle a similar range of roles.

==Acting career==
Miner&#x27;s television credits include Vickie in &quot;Shining Time Station: &#x27;Tis a Gift&quot; (1990), Michelle Bauer on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; (1990–1995), a guest starring role as Laurel in a &quot;Sex and the City&quot; episode, &quot;Twenty-something Girls vs. Thirty-something Women&quot; and Astrid in &quot;NY-LON&quot;.

In 2001, she starred in &quot;Bully&quot;. The film was based on the murder of Bobby Kent. &quot;Bully&quot; received mixed reviews from critics and has a &quot;Rotten&quot; rating of 54% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 91 reviews with an average score of 5.7 out of 10. The film holds a score of 45 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 26 critics indicating &#x27;Mixed or average reviews&#x27;. Miner won an award at the Stockholm Film Festival for Best Actress. 

In 2005, Miner portrayed a young woman on a journey to discover who she is and why multiple enemies want her dead in the action film &quot;Circadian Rhythm&quot;. The movie was critically ignored, and was poorly received in its few reviews. One reviewer stated that the film was a &quot;directionless jumble of boring scenes strung together tenuously by a plot that feels like they were making it up as they went along,&quot; and that watching the film&#x27;s allegedly ‘wire-fu’ fight scenes was akin to &quot;being over at a friend&#x27;s house when they’re getting yelled at by their parents.&quot;

She appeared in 12 episodes of the 2007 television series &quot;Californication&quot;, as Dani California, a reference to a character appearing in several songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. In 2008, she appeared in &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;, an episode of &quot;Fear Itself&quot;. That same year she was also cast as the second lead in the psychological thriller &quot;The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations&quot;. The movie was filmed in Michigan and concluded filming in October 2008. It debuted at After Dark Horrorfest III, a horror film festival held in January 2009. The film was released on DVD on March 31, 2009.

From 2009 to 2013, Miner took over the role of Meg, a recurring antagonist and demon in &quot;Supernatural&quot;. The writers wanted Meg&#x27;s original actress Nicki Aycox to reprise the role in later seasons, but ultimately cast Miner for storyline purposes. The character was eventually killed off later. Tim Janson of Mania gave Miner&#x27;s portrayal of Meg a positive review, saying no one played Meg &quot;with such dripping sarcasm as Rachel Miner&quot;. He felt she &quot;always adds spice when she appears&quot;. Similarly, Diana Steenbergen of IGN 
felt Miner played the role &quot;with vicious flair&quot; and &quot;[conveyed] Meg&#x27;s brutality well, right from the beginning&quot;. As time passed, she noted that the actress &quot;has done well taking over the role&quot;. In 2020, Miner returned to &quot;Supernatural&quot; during the fifteenth season playing the character of a cosmic entity known as the Empty that takes Meg&#x27;s physical appearance. Miner reappeared later in the season, reprising the role of the Empty.

In 2010, Miner starred alongside James Franco in the Grasshopper segment of &quot;Love &amp; Distrust&quot;. The next year she was cast as Sgt. Hannah in the horror film &quot;51&quot;, which began filming in April 2011 in Louisiana. The film was released in limited theaters as part of &quot;After Dark Originals&quot;.

<text>Off-road transport is moving people or articles on land without the use of paved roads, typically using off-road vehicles.

== Off-roading ==
Off-roading is the activity of driving or riding a vehicle on unsurfaced roads or tracks, made of materials such as sand, gravel, riverbeds, mud, snow, rocks, and other natural terrain.

== Off-road racing ==
Off-road racing is a format of racing where various classes of specially modified vehicles (including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buggies) compete in races through off-road environments.

== Off-road vehicle ==
An off-road vehicle is considered to be any type of vehicle which is capable of driving on and off paved or gravel surface. It is generally characterized by having large tires with deep, open treads, a flexible suspension, or even caterpillar tracks. Other vehicles that do not travel public streets or highways are generally termed off-highway vehicles, including tractors, forklifts, cranes, backhoes, bulldozers, and golf carts.

Off-road vehicles have an enthusiastic following because of their many uses and versatility. The use of higher clearance and higher traction vehicles enables access on trails and forest roads that have rough and low traction surfaces.

<text>Thornaby-on-Tees, commonly referred to as Thornaby, is a town and civil parish in North Yorkshire and falls under Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council, England. The parish had a population of 24,741 at the 2011 census, in the Teesside built-up area. It is located on the south bank of the River Tees.

The town was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1892, during the Victorian era. The borough was abolished in 1968 on the creation of the County Borough of Teesside. A civil parish called Thornaby was re-created in 1996.

The modern centre was built on the north eastern part of Thornaby airfield and lies south-east of Stockton-on-Tees and south-west of Middlesbrough.

==History==
=== Prehistoric ===
There are other signs of Thornaby being a much older settlement. Traces of prehistoric man have been found, the earliest being a stone axe, 8 inches long, dating back to the Mesolithic Period (about 3000 BC). In 1926, a dugout canoe said to date from about 1600 – 1400 BC was found in the mud under of water opposite Thornaby High Wood. An arrowhead of the Neolithic Period (about 3000 BC) was found in a garden on Thornaby Village Green.

===Danes===

The name Thornaby came into existence about AD 800 when the land was given by Halfdene (Halfdan Ragnarsson), King of the Danes, to Thormod, one of his noblemen, hence &quot;Thormods-by&quot; – Thormod&#x27;s farmstead. Although the -by suffix originally meant a farmstead, many of these grew into villages, taking the -by suffix with them in their names as with other villages in the area, such as Danby, Faceby, Ingleby, Maltby and Ormesby.

During the Battle of Hastings (1066), one of William the Conqueror&#x27;s noblemen, Robert I de Brus, marched north with a garrison of men and occupied the area of Cleveland. William gave him those lands to control including Thornaby and Middlesbrough.

King Sweyn II of Denmark, on 9 September 1069, defeated the Normans at York by killing the entire garrison of 3,000 men. William swore an oath to take revenge on Sweyn by destroying every house and dwelling in the lands under Sweyn&#x27;s rule, leaving all the land in the north east of Yorkshire barren and bare.

In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; Thornaby is mentioned five times, Thornaby&#x27;s first mention in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; states:- &quot;Robert Malet has these lands and they are waste.&quot; It appears that they remained undeveloped until the early 19th century as &quot;Thurnaby waaste&quot; is mentioned in a poem by Tennyson called &quot;The Northern Farmer.&quot;.

Over the centuries there have been a number of different spellings of the name Thornaby including Turmozbi, Tormozbi, Tormozbia and Thurmozbi. The form Thornaby first appears in 1665 and refers to old Thornaby village, south western area of the present town which is near the River Tees as it flows north east.

=== The Five Lamps of St Peter&#x27;s Church ===

It is said that Robert de Thormodbi, wounded in the Crusades at Acre, swore to raise a shrine to the Virgin Mary if he survived his wounds. He did, and as part of his wish a shrine niche to the Virgin Mary, lit by five sanctuary lamps, was placed in St Peter&#x27;s Church.

===A town from the marshes===

In 1825, old Thornaby was centred around St Peter&#x27;s Church and the old village green. Thornaby Carrs (marshes) had been a site of intermittent horse racing before moving to the now former Stockton Racecourse after the River Tees was straightened in 1810, a short distance down stream. From 1825, industry started to be built south of Stockton&#x27;s existing port industry as Stockton and Darlington Railway had been established, old Stockton railway station being just on the other side of the bank. The first site was William Smith&#x27;s pottery with the area quickly growing with shipbuilding and engineering companies established on the marshes. From 1840 until June 1987 heavy engineering firm Head Wrightson was a major employer in Thornaby.

The area developing on the south bank of the Tees opposite Stockton was initially known as South Stockton. As Stockton&#x27;s port industry moved to Middlesbrough, shipbuilding was replaced by iron works. A new railway line opened up the area south of the river for further development, with a South Stockton railway station built in 1882.

The new settlement grew as a work force for new industry, spreading south down and between Thornaby Road, the new Westbury Street, and Mandale Road (once known as Acklam Road). The built-up area of South Stockton grew to merge with the old village of Thornaby; on 6 October 1892 South Stockton and Thornaby formally merged to form a municipal borough which was named Thornaby-on-Tees. South Stockton station was renamed to Thornaby. Thornaby Town Hall was built for the old South Stockton Local Board, and was completed in 1892 a few months before the board was replaced by the new borough council.

===The airfield, 608 squadron and Spitfires===

The earliest known flying in Thornaby took place in 1912 when Matthew Young of the Vale Farm was paid 100 Gold Sovereigns for the use of a field for an airshow. Taking place on a Saturday afternoon in June or July, one of the main events was flying by Gustav Hamel, an early flying pioneer. The next known use was by the Royal Flying Corps who used the same fields between 1914 and 1918 as a staging post between Catterick and Marske aerodromes.

In about 1925 negotiations began on the opening of a full-time aerodrome and in the late 1920s the Air Ministry constructed an airfield to the south of the town and the station which was the second permanent aerodrome to be built in Yorkshire (the first being Catterick) was opened on 29 September 1929. During the Second World War, Thornaby came under the control of 18 group, Coastal Command, before this however it had come under Flying Training, Fighter and Bomber Commands, and post-war under Reserve and Fighter Commands, at this time (post-war) it was also used by the Royal Air Force Regiment. During the war a variety of tasks were carried out from RAF Thornaby, such as, attacks on targets in Europe, anti-submarine patrols, operational training, strikes against enemy shipping, leaflet dropping and air sea rescue operations.

608 (North Riding) squadron
Of all the squadrons to have been based at RAF Thornaby during its operational period, &quot;Thornaby&#x27;s own&quot; 608 (North Riding) squadron is probably the squadron best remembered by the townsfolk. It was formed at Thornaby on 17 March 1930 and went on to serve within both Coastal and Bomber Commands during the Second World War. After the war, on 10 May 1946 the squadron was re-formed at Thornaby and carried on in Reserve Command &quot;at home&quot; until the squadron disbanded for the last time on 10 March 1957. 608 (North Riding) Squadron&#x27;s Standard, which was approved by the Queen and bears their battle honours, can be seen housed in York Minster under the Astronomical Clock where it was laid-up on 14 November 1959. The numerous items of glass and silverware which were presented to the squadron during their service are held by Middlesbrough Council, are housed in Middlesbrough Town Hall and are to be returned to the squadron should it ever re-form.

===Acquiring inland areas===
The last R.A.F aircraft to leave the airfield (Hawker Hunter F6s) left on 1 October 1958 and further use of Thornaby as a regional airport on 23 February 1962 ended when all but of land was purchased from the Air Ministry by Thornaby-on-Tees Borough Council.

As Thornaby changed hand to the County Borough of Teesside (1968–1974) then, on its third attempt, into the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees (this was initially as a district of Cleveland county). Development in the 1960s and 1970s on transforming the airfield, demolishing its buildings, into housing, shops, offices, a sport centre and a light industrial estate, the light industrial estate was the first in the wider area and therefore called Teesside Industrial Estate.

Many symbols of Thornaby&#x27;s aeronautical past were placed for prosperity with streets (such as Allensway), buildings and public houses using names of Royal Air Force aircraft, stations and personnel. The Bader School (built on the former airfield) on Kintyre Drive was named after and opened by Sir Douglas Bader on 10 November 1971. In 1976 a stained glass window in St Paul&#x27;s Church on Thornaby Road was dedicated to the RAF at Thornaby and in 1997 a statue was erected on Thornaby Road, it is dedicated to all who served at RAF Thornaby.

In 2007 a full-size replica Supermarine Spitfire aircraft was erected on the roundabout at the junction of Thornaby Road, Bader Avenue and Trenchard Avenue. Hidden beneath the roundabout is part of a runway (one of three) which used to run east to west.

===Rise and fall of Pavilion towers===
Thornaby town centre declined post war with deindustrialation and the town&#x27;s population centre shifting south east on to the old airfield. Facilities followed as the new Pavilion shops opened and the old centre cut off by the A66. The former Industry around the old Thornaby Carrs centre became Teesdale Business Park leaving the station and town hall out of place in the new surroundings.

In the late 2000s, Thornaby Pavilion was designated as the new town centre. Housing around the shops were cleared and new shops built opposite the older shops to form a pedestrian high street. An official relaunch event was held in the now Thornaby town centre on 25 April 2009. High rises flats in the town centre have been demolished and with the towns fund, they are plans for the former Npower offices site are planned to be demolished and a replacement for Thornaby Pool, an indoor baths on Thornaby Road, built in its place. The former Golden Eagle Hotel is also to be demolished.

==Community and culture==
Thornaby won a number of awards in 2008; the silver gilt award for best small cities, Northumbria in Bloom, which was repeated in 2011. Thornaby Cemetery had &quot;Cemetery of the Year&quot; award in 2006. The cemetery had lost then lost its Green flag award until 2011.

On 10 November 2011 an R.A.F. Search and Rescue Sea King Helicopter paid a three-hour visit to Bader primary to help celebrate the 40th anniversary of Sir Douglas Bader opening the school. The day of activities included a visit by representatives from RAF Leeming, the Commanding Officer at Catterick Garrison, Middlesbrough Armed Forces Careers Office and the Cleveland Mountain Rescue Team.

Thornaby held its eleventh Yorkshire Day event in August 2017. The annual Thornaby Show takes place at the beginning of September, it is estimated that more than 10,000 people turn up over the course of the day.

In January 2014 a McDonald&#x27;s and Asda opened on the site of the former Tristar Neasham site. Teesside Park is the location of a shopping park which occupies a former racecourse.

== Demographics ==
==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Thornaby, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Thornaby Town Council and Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. The borough council is also a constituent member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority, which is led by the directly elected Mayor of Tees Valley. The town council is based at the Town Hall on Mandale Road.

===Administrative history===
Thornaby was historically a township and chapelry in the ancient parish of Stainton in the North Riding of Yorkshire. A local government district called South Stockton was established covering the northern part of the township in 1863, governed by a local board. In 1874 the district was enlarged to take in an area including Stockton Racecourse to the east of the original district. This area formed part of the parish of Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham, but had been cut off from the rest of Stockton-on-Tees when the River Tees had been straightened in 1810. The South Stockton local government district then straddled Yorkshire and County Durham until 1887, when the county boundary was also adjusted to follow the straightened course of the River Tees, after which South Stockton was again entirely in Yorkshire.

In 1892 the South Stockton Local Board was abolished when a municipal borough was created covering the whole township of Thornaby, with the new borough being named &quot;Thornaby-on-Tees&quot;. It was amalgamated with other areas in 1968 to form the county borough of Teesside. In 1974, the town became part of the enlarged Stockton-on-Tees district of Cleveland non-metropolitan county.

&quot;Thornaby Town Council&quot; was created in 1995. Cleveland county was abolished in 1996 under the Banham review. In 1997 the parts of the abolished county of Cleveland south of the River Tees, including Thornaby, were placed in North Yorkshire for ceremonial purposes.
In 2012 the town council purchased Thornaby Town Hall from the borough council for restorations. The hall, dating back to 1890–92, had been unoccupied since the 1968 county borough of Teesside amalgamation. It is now the main building used by Thornaby Town Council.

==Religion==
=== Church of England ===

The Church of St Peter ad Vincula on the village green is of 12th-century origin but a place of worship existed at the time of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086. The unusual dedication to St Peter ad Vincula (&quot;St Peter in chains&quot;) is derived from the ancient Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome. The building, with a simple nave and a bell turret with two bells, was originally dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. Grace Pace, the mother of Captain James Cook, was baptised at St Peter&#x27;s in 1702. The larger St Paul&#x27;s serves most of the town.

It is labelled Stockton due to it being in or near the former Stockton South settlement, which lied on the southern banks of the river Tees (Yorkshire) and merged into Thornaby on Tees.

===University===
Adjacent to the college is Durham University&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Campus. This was founded in 1992 as a joint venture between Durham and Teesside universities, becoming exclusively part of Durham University in 1998. In 2019, the university moved the Queen&#x27;s Campus colleges and departments to Durham city, and repurposed the campus as a new International Study Centre, run by Study Group.

<doc id="407233" wikidata="Q211627" url="?curid=407233" title="Global dimming">
<text>Global dimming is a decline in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface. It is caused by atmospheric particulate matter, predominantly sulfate aerosols, which are components of air pollution. Global dimming was observed soon after the first systematic measurements of solar irradiance began in the 1950s. This weakening of visible sunlight proceeded at the rate of 4–5% per decade until the 1980s. During these years, air pollution increased due to post-war industrialization. Solar activity did not vary more than the usual during this period.

Aerosols have a cooling effect on the earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and global dimming has masked the extent of global warming experienced to date, with the most polluted regions even experiencing cooling in the 1970s. Global dimming has interfered with the water cycle by lowering evaporation, and thus has probably reduced rainfall in certain areas. It may have weakened the Monsoon of South Asia and caused the entire tropical rain belt to shift southwards between 1950 and 1985, with a limited recovery afterwards. Record levels of particulate pollution in the Northern Hemisphere caused or at least exacerbated the monsoon failure behind the 1984 Ethiopian famine.

Since the 1980s, a decrease in air pollution has led to a partial reversal of the dimming trend, sometimes referred to as global brightening. This global brightening had contributed to the acceleration of global warming, which began in the 1990s. According to climate models, the dimming effect of aerosols most likely offsets around of warming as of 2021. As nations act to reduce the toll of air pollution on the health of their citizens, the masking effect on global warming is expected to decline further. The scenarios for climate action required to meet and targets incorporate the predicted decrease in aerosol levels. However, model simulations of the effects of aerosols on weather systems remain uncertain.

The processes behind global dimming are similar to stratospheric aerosol injection. This is a proposed solar geoengineering intervention which aims to counteract global warming through intentional releases of reflective aerosols. Stratospheric aerosol injection could be very effective at stopping or reversing warming but it would also have substantial effects on the global water cycle, regional weather, and ecosystems. Furthermore, it would have to be carried out over centuries to prevent a rapid and violent return of the warming.

==History==

In the 1970s, numerous studies showed that atmospheric aerosols could affect the propagation of sunlight through the atmosphere, a measure also known as direct solar irradiance. One study showed that less sunlight was filtering through at the height of above Los Angeles, even on those days when there was no visible smog. Another suggested that sulfate pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age. In the 1980s, Atsumu Ohmura, a geography researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, found that solar radiation striking the Earth&#x27;s surface had declined by more than 10% over the three previous decades, even as the global temperature had been generally rising since the 1970s. In the 1990s, this was followed by the papers describing multi-decade declines in Estonia, Germany, Israel and across the former Soviet Union.

Subsequent research estimated an average reduction in sunlight striking the terrestrial surface of around 4–5% per decade over the late 1950s–1980s, and 2–3% per decade when 1990s were included. Notably, solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere did not vary by more than 0.1-0.3% in all that time, strongly suggesting that the reasons for the dimming were on Earth. Additionally, only visible light and infrared radiation were dimmed, rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Further, the dimming had occurred even when the skies were clear, and it was in fact stronger than during the cloudy days, proving that it was not caused by changes in cloud cover alone.

==Causes==
=== Anthropogenic sulfates ===

Global dimming is primarily caused by the presence of sulfate particles which hang in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere as aerosols. These aerosols have both a direct contribution to dimming, as they reflect sunlight like tiny mirrors. They also have an indirect effect as nuclei, meaning that water droplets in clouds coalesce around the particles. Increased pollution causes more particulates and thereby creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets (that is, the same amount of water is spread over more droplets). The smaller droplets make clouds more reflective, so that more incoming sunlight is reflected back into space and less reaches the Earth&#x27;s surface. In models, these smaller droplets also decrease rainfall.

Before the Industrial Revolution, the main source of sulfate aerosols was dimethyl sulfide produced by some types of oceanic plankton. Emissions from volcano activity were the second largest source, although large volcanic eruptions, such as the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, dominate in the years when they occur. In 1990, the IPCC First Assessment Report estimated dimethyl sulfide emissions at 40 million tons per year, while volcano emissions were estimated at 10 million tons. These annual levels have been largely stable for a long time. On the other hand, global human-caused emissions of sulfur into the atmosphere increased from less than 3 million tons per year in 1860 to 15 million tonnes in 1900, 40 million tonnes in 1940 and about 80 million tonnes in 1980. This meant that by 1980, the human-caused emissions from the burning of sulfur-containing fuels (mostly coal and bunker fuel) became at least as large as &quot;all&quot; natural emissions of sulfur-containing compounds. The report also concluded that &quot;in the industrialized regions of Europe and North America, anthropogenic emissions dominate over natural emissions by about a factor of ten or even more&quot;.

=== Black carbon ===

Another important type of aerosol is black carbon, colloquially known as soot. It is formed due to incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, as well as of wood and other plant matter. Globally, the single largest source of black carbon is from grassland and forest fires, including both wildfires and intentional burning. However, coal use is responsible for the majority (60 to 80%) of black carbon emissions in Asia and Africa, while diesel combustion produces 70% of black carbon in Europe and The Americas.

Black carbon in the lower atmosphere is a major contributor to 7 million premature deaths caused by air pollution every year. Its presence is particularly visible, as the so-called &quot;brown clouds&quot; appear in heavily polluted areas. In fact, it was 1970s research into the Denver brown cloud which had first found that black carbon particles absorb solar energy and so can affect the amount of visible sunlight. Later research found that black carbon is 190 times more effective at absorbing sunlight within clouds than the regular dust from soil particles. At worst, all clouds within an atmospheric layer thick are visibly darkened, and the plume can reach transcontinental scale (i.e. the Asian brown cloud.) Even so, the overall dimming from black carbon is much lower than that from the sulfate particles.

== Reversal ==
After 1990, the global dimming trend had clearly switched to global brightening. This followed measures taken to combat air pollution by the developed nations, typically through flue-gas desulfurization installations at thermal power plants, such as wet scrubbers or fluidized bed combustion. In the United States, sulfate aerosols have declined significantly since 1970 with the passage of the Clean Air Act, which was strengthened in 1977 and 1990. According to the EPA, from 1970 to 2005, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants, including sulfates, dropped by 53% in the US. By 2010, this reduction in sulfate pollution led to estimated healthcare cost savings valued at $50 billion annually. Similar measures were taken in Europe, such as the 1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulfur Emissions under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, and with similar improvements. 

On the other hand, a 2009 review found that dimming continued to increase in China after stabilizing in the 1990s and intensified in India, consistent with their continued industrialization, while the US, Europe, and South Korea continued to brighten. Evidence from Zimbabwe, Chile and Venezuela also pointed to increased dimming during that period, albeit at a lower confidence level due to the lower number of observations. Later research found that over China, the dimming trend continued at a slower rate after 1990, and did not begin to reverse until around 2005. Due to these contrasting trends, no statistically significant change had occurred on a global scale from 2001 to 2012. Post-2010 observations indicate that the global decline in aerosol concentrations and global dimming continued, with pollution controls on the global shipping industry playing a substantial role in the recent years. Since nearly 90% of the human population lives in the Northern Hemisphere, clouds there are far more affected by aerosols than in the Southern Hemisphere, but these differences have halved in the two decades since 2000, providing further evidence for the ongoing global brightening.

==Relationship to climate change==

=== Cooling from sulfate aerosols ===

Aerosols have a cooling effect, which has masked the total extent of global warming experienced to date.

It has been understood for a long time that any effect on solar irradiance from aerosols would necessarily impact Earth&#x27;s radiation balance. Reductions in atmospheric temperatures have already been observed after large volcanic eruptions such as the 1963 eruption of Mount Agung in Bali, 1982 El Chichón eruption in Mexico, 1985 Nevado del Ruiz eruption in Colombia and 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. However, even the major eruptions only result in temporary jumps of sulfur particles, unlike the more sustained increases caused by anthropogenic pollution.

In 1990, the IPCC First Assessment Report acknowledged that &quot;Human-made aerosols, from sulphur emitted largely in fossil fuel combustion can modify clouds and this may act to lower temperatures&quot;, while &quot;a decrease in emissions of sulphur might be expected to increase global temperatures&quot;. However, lack of observational data and difficulties in calculating indirect effects on clouds left the report unable to estimate whether the total impact of all anthropogenic aerosols on the global temperature amounted to cooling or warming. By 1995, the IPCC Second Assessment Report had confidently assessed the overall impact of aerosols as negative (cooling); however, aerosols were recognized as the largest source of uncertainty in future projections in that report and the subsequent ones.

=== Warming from black carbon ===
Unlike sulfate pollution, black carbon contributes to both global dimming and global warming, since its particles absorb sunlight and heat up instead of reflecting it away. These particles also develop thick coatings over time, which can increase the initial absorption by up to 40%. Because the rate at which these coatings are formed varies depending on the season, the warming from black carbon varies seasonally as well.

Though this warming is weaker than the -induced warming or the cooling from sulfates, it can be regionally significant when black carbon is deposited over ice masses like mountain glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet. There, it reduces their albedo and increases their absorption of solar radiation, which accelerates their melting. Black carbon also has an outsized contribution to local warming inside polluted cities. Even the indirect effect of soot particles acting as cloud nuclei is not strong enough to provide cooling: the &quot;brown clouds&quot; formed around soot particles were known to have a net warming effect since the 2000s. Black carbon pollution is particularly strong over India: thus, it is considered to be one of the few regions where cleaning up air pollution would reduce, rather than increase, warming.

=== Minor role of aircraft contrails ===


Aircraft leave behind visible contrails (also known as vapor trails) as they travel. These contrails both reflect incoming solar radiation and trap outgoing longwave radiation that is emitted by the Earth. Because contrails reflect sunlight only during the day, but trap heat day and night, they are normally considered to cause net warming, albeit very small. A 1992 estimate was between 3.5 mW/m2 and 17 mW/m2 – hundreds of times smaller than the radiative forcing from major greenhouse gases.

However, some scientists argued that the daytime cooling effect from contrails was much stronger than usually estimated, and this argument attracted attention following the September 11 attacks. Because no commercial aircraft flew across the US in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, this period was considered a real-world demonstration of contrail-free weather. Across 4,000 weather stations in the continental United States, the diurnal temperature variation (the difference in the day&#x27;s highs and lows at a fixed station) was widened by – the largest recorded increase in 30 years. In the southern US, the difference was diminished by about , and by in the US midwest. This was interpreted by some scientists as a proof of a strong cooling influence of aircraft contrails.

Ultimately, follow-up studies found that a natural change in cloud cover which occurred at the time was sufficient to explain these findings. When the global response to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic led to a reduction in global air traffic of nearly 70% relative to 2019, multiple studies found &quot;no significant response of diurnal surface air temperature range&quot; as the result of contrail changes, and either &quot;no net significant global ERF&quot; (effective radiative forcing) or a very small warming effect.

=== Historical cooling ===

At the peak of global dimming, it was able to counteract the warming trend completely. By 1975, the continually increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases have overcome the masking effect and dominated ever since. Even then, regions with high concentrations of sulfate aerosols due to air pollution had initially experienced cooling, in contradiction to the overall warming trend. The eastern United States was a prominent example: the temperatures there declined by between 1970 and 1980, and by up to in the Arkansas and Missouri.

=== Brightening and accelerated warming ===

Starting in the 1980s, the reduction in global dimming has contributed to higher global temperatures. Hot extremes accelerated as global dimming abated. It has been estimated that since the mid-1990s, peak daily temperatures in northeast Asia and hottest days of the year in Western Europe would have been substantially less hot if aerosol concentrations had stayed the same as before. Some of the acceleration of sea level rise, as well as Arctic amplification and the associated Arctic sea ice decline, was also attributed to the reduction in aerosol masking.

In Europe, the declines in aerosol concentrations since the 1980s had also reduced the associated fog, mist and haze: altogether, it was responsible for about 10–20% of daytime warming across Europe, and about 50% of the warming over the more polluted Eastern Europe. Because aerosol cooling depends on reflecting sunlight, air quality improvements had a negligible impact on wintertime temperatures, but had increased temperatures from April to September by around in Central and Eastern Europe. The central and eastern United States experienced warming of between 1980 and 2010 as sulfate pollution was reduced, even as sulfate particles still accounted for around 25% of all particulates. By 2021, the northeastern coast of the United States was one of the fastest-warming regions of North America, as the slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation increased temperatures in that part of the North Atlantic Ocean.

In 2020, COVID-19 lockdowns provided a notable &quot;natural experiment&quot;, as there had been a marked decline in sulfate and black carbon emissions caused by the curtailed road traffic and industrial output. That decline did have a detectable warming impact: it was estimated to have increased global temperatures by initially and up to by 2023, before disappearing. Regionally, the lockdowns were estimated to increase temperatures by in eastern China over January–March, and then by over Europe, eastern United States, and South Asia in March–May, with the peak impact of in some regions of the United States and Russia. In the city of Wuhan, the urban heat island effect was found to have decreased by at night and by overall during the strictest lockdowns.

=== Future ===

Since changes in aerosol concentrations already have an impact on the global climate, they would necessarily influence future projections as well. In fact, it is impossible to fully estimate the warming impact of all greenhouse gases without accounting for the counteracting cooling from aerosols.

Climate models started to account for the effects of sulfate aerosols around the IPCC Second Assessment Report; when the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report was published in 2007, every climate model had integrated sulfates, but only 5 were able to account for less impactful particulates like black carbon. By 2021, CMIP6 models estimated total aerosol cooling in the range from to ; The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report selected the best estimate of a cooling provided by sulfate aerosols, while black carbon amounts to about of warming. While these values are based on combining model estimates with observational constraints, including those on ocean heat content, the matter is not yet fully settled. The difference between model estimates mainly stems from disagreements over the indirect effects of aerosols on clouds.

Regardless of the current strength of aerosol cooling, all future climate change scenarios project decreases in particulates and this includes the scenarios where and targets are met: their specific emission reduction targets assume the need to make up for lower dimming. Since models estimate that the cooling caused by sulfates is largely equivalent to the warming caused by atmospheric methane (and since methane is a relatively short-lived greenhouse gas), it is believed that simultaneous reductions in both would effectively cancel each other out.
 Yet, in the recent years, methane concentrations had been increasing at rates exceeding their previous period of peak growth in the 1980s, with wetland methane emissions driving much of the recent growth, while air pollution is getting cleaned up aggressively. These trends are some of the main reasons why warming is now expected around 2030, as opposed to the mid-2010s estimates where it would not occur until 2040.

It has also been suggested that aerosols are not given sufficient attention in regional risk assessments, in spite of being more influential on a regional scale than globally. For instance, a climate change scenario with high greenhouse gas emissions but strong reductions in air pollution would see more global warming by 2050 than the same scenario with little improvement in air quality, but regionally, the difference would add 5 more tropical nights per year in northern China and substantially increase precipitation in northern China and northern India. Likewise, a paper comparing current level of clean air policies with a hypothetical maximum technically feasible action under otherwise the same climate change scenario found that the latter would increase the risk of temperature extremes by 30–50% in China and in Europe.

Unfortunately, because historical records of aerosols are sparser in some regions than in others, accurate regional projections of aerosol impacts are difficult. Even the latest CMIP6 climate models can only accurately represent aerosol trends over Europe, but struggle with representing North America and Asia. This means that their near-future projections of regional impacts are likely to contain errors as well.

==Relationship with water cycle==
On regional and global scale, air pollution can affect the water cycle, in a manner similar to some natural processes. One example is the impact of Sahara dust on hurricane formation: air laden with sand and mineral particles moves over the Atlantic Ocean, where they block some of the sunlight from reaching the water surface, slightly cooling it and dampening the development of hurricanes. Likewise, it has been suggested since the early 2000s that since aerosols decrease solar radiation over the ocean and hence reduce evaporation from it, they would be &quot;spinning down the hydrological cycle of the planet.&quot;

In 2011, it was found that anthropogenic aerosols had been the predominant factor behind 20th century changes in rainfall over the Atlantic Ocean sector, when the entire tropical rain belt shifted southwards between 1950 and 1985, with a limited northwards shift afterwards. Future reductions in aerosol emissions are expected to result in a more rapid northwards shift, with limited impact in the Atlantic but a substantially greater impact in the Pacific. Some research also suggests that these reductions would affect the AMOC (already expected to weaken due to climate change). Reductions from the stronger air quality policies could exacerbate this expected decline by around 10%, unless methane emissions are reduced by an equivalent amount.

Most notably, multiple studies connect aerosols from the Northern Hemisphere to the failed monsoon in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, which then led to the Sahel drought and the associated famine. However, model simulations of Sahel climate are very inconsistent, so it&#x27;s difficult to prove that the drought would &quot;not&quot; have occurred without aerosol pollution, although it would have clearly been less severe. Some research indicates that those models which demonstrate warming alone driving strong precipitation increases in the Sahel are the most accurate, making it more likely that sulfate pollution was to blame for overpowering this response and sending the region into drought.

Another dramatic finding had connected the impact of aerosols with the weakening of the Monsoon of South Asia. It was first advanced in 2006, yet it also remained difficult to prove. In particular, some research suggested that warming itself increases the risk of monsoon failure, potentially pushing it past a tipping point. By 2021, however, it was concluded that global warming consistently strengthened the monsoon, and some strengthening was already observed in the aftermath of lockdown-caused aerosol reductions.

In 2009, an analysis of 50 years of data found that light rains had decreased over eastern China, even though there was no significant change in the amount of water held by the atmosphere. This was attributed to aerosols reducing droplet size within clouds, which led to those clouds retaining water for a longer time without raining. The phenomenon of aerosols suppressing rainfall through reducing cloud droplet size has been confirmed by subsequent studies. Later research found that aerosol pollution over South and East Asia didn&#x27;t just suppress rainfall there, but also resulted in more moisture transferred to Central Asia, where summer rainfall had increased as the result. In the United States, effects of climate change on the water cycle would typically increase both mean and extreme precipitation across the country, but these effects have so far been &quot;masked&quot; by the drying due to historically strong aerosol concentrations. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report had also linked changes in aerosol concentrations to altered precipitation in the Mediterranean region.

== Relevance for solar geoengineering ==
Global dimming is also relevant for certain proposals about slowing, halting, or reversing global warming. An increase in planetary albedo of 1% would eliminate most of radiative forcing from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and thereby global warming, while a 2% albedo increase would negate the warming effect of doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. This is the theory behind solar geoengineering, and the high reflective potential of sulfate aerosols means that they were considered in this capacity starting from the 1970s.

Because the historical levels of global dimming were associated with high mortality from air pollution and issues such as acid rain, the concept of relying on cooling directly from pollution has been described as a &quot;Faustian bargain&quot; and is not seriously considered by modern research. Instead, the seminal 2006 paper by Paul Crutzen suggested that the way to avoid increased warming as the sulfate pollution decreased was to revisit the 1974 proposal by the Soviet researcher Mikhail Budyko. The proposal involved releasing sulfates from the airplanes flying in the upper layers of the atmosphere, in what is now described as stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI. In comparison, most air pollution is in the lower atmospheric layer (the troposphere), and only resides there for weeks. Because aerosols deposited in the stratosphere would last for years, far less sulfur would have to be emitted to produce the same amount of cooling.

While Crutzen&#x27;s initial proposal focused on avoiding the warming caused by the reductions in air pollution, it was immediately understood that scaling up this proposal could slow, stop, or reverse warming. It has been estimated that the amount of sulfur needed to offset a warming of around relative to now (and relative to the preindustrial), under the highest-emission scenario RCP 8.5 would be less than what is already emitted through air pollution today, and that reductions in sulfur pollution from future air quality improvements already expected under that scenario would offset the sulfur used for geoengineering. The trade-off is increased cost. Although there&#x27;s a popular narrative that stratospheric aerosol injection can be carried out by individuals, small states, or other non-state rogue actors, scientific estimates suggest that cooling the atmosphere by through stratospheric aerosol injection would cost at least $18 billion annually (at 2020 USD value), meaning that only the largest economies or economic blocs could afford this intervention. Even so, these approaches would still be &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; cheaper than greenhouse gas mitigation, let alone the costs of unmitigated effects of climate change.

Even if SAI were to stop or outright reverse global warming, weather patterns in many areas would still change substantially. The habitat of mosquitoes and other disease vectors would shift. However, it&#x27;s unclear how it would compare to the shifts that are otherwise likely to occur from climate change. Lower sunlight would affect crop yields and carbon sinks due to reduced photosynthesis, but this would likely be offset by lack of thermal stress from warming and the greater CO2 fertilization effect relative to now. Most importantly, the warming from emissions lasts for hundreds to thousands of years, while the cooling from SAI stops 1–3 years after the last aerosol injection. This means that neither stratospheric aerosol injection nor other forms of solar geoengineering can be used as a substitute for reducing greenhouse gas emissions because if solar geoengineering were to cease. In contrast, if greenhouse gas levels remained high, it would lead to &quot;large and extremely rapid&quot; warming and similarly abrupt changes to the water cycle. Many thousands of species would likely go extinct as a result. Instead, any solar geoengineering would act as a temporary measure to limit warming. At the same time, emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced and carbon dioxide is removed, which may well take hundreds of years.

<doc id="407234" wikidata="Q1503359" url="?curid=407234" title="Self-pollination">
<text>Self-pollination is a form of pollination in which pollen arrives at the stigma of a flower (in flowering plants) or at the ovule (in gymnosperms) of the same plant. The term cross-pollination is used for the opposite case, where pollen from one plant moves to a different plant.

There are two types of self-pollination: in autogamy, pollen is transferred to the stigma of the same flower; in geitonogamy, pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on the same flowering plant, or from microsporangium to ovule within a single (monoecious) gymnosperm. Some plants have mechanisms that ensure autogamy, such as flowers that do not open (cleistogamy), or stamens that move to come into contact with the stigma. 

The term selfing that is often used as a synonym is not limited to self-pollination, but also applies to other types of self-fertilization.

== Occurrence ==
Few plants self-pollinate without the aid of pollen vectors (such as wind or insects). The mechanism is seen most often in some legumes such as peanuts. In another legume, soybeans, the flowers open and remain receptive to insect cross pollination during the day. If this is not accomplished, the flowers self-pollinate as they are closing. Among other plants that can self-pollinate are many kinds of orchids, peas, sunflowers and tridax. Most of the self-pollinating plants have small, relatively inconspicuous flowers that shed pollen directly onto the stigma, sometimes even before the bud opens. Self-pollinated plants expend less energy in the production of pollinator attractants and can grow in areas where the kinds of insects or other animals that might visit them are absent or very scarce—as in the Arctic or at high elevations.

Self-pollination limits the variety of progeny and may depress plant vigor. However, self-pollination can be advantageous, allowing plants to spread beyond the range of suitable pollinators or produce offspring in areas where pollinator populations have been greatly reduced or are naturally variable.

Pollination can also be accomplished by cross-pollination. Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen, by wind or animals such as insects and birds, from the anther to the stigma of flowers on separate plants.

== Types of self-pollinating flowers ==
Both hermaphrodite and monoecious species have the potential for self-pollination leading to self-fertilization unless there is a mechanism to avoid it. 80% of all flowering plants are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both sexes in the same flower, while 5 percent of plant species are monoecious. The remaining 15% would therefore be dioecious (each plant unisexual). Plants that self-pollinate include several types of orchids, and sunflowers. Dandelions are capable of self-pollination as well as cross-pollination.

== Advantages ==
There are several advantages for self-pollinating flowers. Firstly, if a given genotype is well-suited for an environment, self-pollination helps to keep this trait stable in the species. Not being dependent on pollinating agents allows self-pollination to occur when bees and wind are nowhere to be found. Self-pollination or cross pollination can be an advantage when the number of flowers is small or they are widely spaced. During self-pollination, the pollen grains are not transmitted from one flower to another. As a result, there is less wastage of pollen. Also, self-pollinating plants do not depend on external carriers. They also cannot make changes in their characters and so the features of a species can be maintained with purity.
Self-pollination also helps to preserve parental characters as the gametes from the same flower are evolved. It is not necessary for flowers to produce nectar, scent, or to be colourful in order to attract pollinators.

== Disadvantages ==
The disadvantages of self-pollination come from a lack of variation that allows no adaptation to the changing environment or potential pathogen attack. Self-pollination can lead to inbreeding depression caused by expression of deleterious recessive mutations, or to the reduced health of the species, due to the breeding of related specimens. This is why many flowers that could potentially self-pollinate have a built-in mechanism to avoid it, or make it second choice at best. Genetic defects in self-pollinating plants cannot be eliminated by genetic recombination and offspring can only avoid inheriting the deleterious attributes through a chance mutation arising in a gamete.

== Mixed mating ==
About 42% of flowering plants exhibit a mixed mating system in nature. In the most common kind of system, individual plants produce a single flower type and fruits may contain self-pollinated, out-crossed or a mixture of progeny types. Another mixed mating system is referred to as dimorphic cleistogamy. In this system a single plant produces both open, potentially out-crossed and closed, obligately self-pollinated cleistogamous flowers.

== Example species ==
The evolutionary shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is one of the most common evolutionary transitions in plants. About 10-15% of flowering plants are predominantly self-fertilizing. A few well-studied examples of self-pollinating species are described below.

=== Orchids ===

Self-pollination in the slipper orchid &quot;Paphiopedilum parishii&quot; occurs when the anther changes from a solid to a liquid state and directly contacts the stigma surface without the aid of any pollinating agent.

The tree-living orchid &quot;Holcoglossum amesianum&quot; has a type of self-pollination mechanism in which the bisexual flower turns its anther against gravity through 360° in order to insert pollen into its own stigma cavity—without the aid of any pollinating agent or medium. This type of self-pollination appears to be an adaptation to the windless, drought conditions that are present when flowering occurs, at a time when insects are scarce. Without pollinators for outcrossing, the necessity of ensuring reproductive success appears to outweigh potential adverse effects of inbreeding. Such an adaptation may be widespread among species in similar environments.

Self-pollination in the Madagascan orchid &quot;Bulbophyllum bicoloratum&quot; occurs by virtue of a rostellum that may have regained its stigmatic function as part of the distal median stigmatic lobe.

=== &quot;Caulokaempferia coenobialis&quot; ===
In the Chinese herb &quot;Caulokaempferia coenobialis&quot; a film of pollen is transported from the anther (pollen sacs) by an oily emulsion that slides sideways along the flower&#x27;s style and into the individual&#x27;s own stigma. The lateral flow of the film of pollen along the style appears to be due solely to the spreading properties of the oily emulsion and not to gravity. This strategy may have evolved to cope with a scarcity of pollinators in the extremely shady and humid habitats of &quot;C. coenobialis&quot;.

=== &quot;Capsella rubella&quot; ===
&quot;Capsella rubella&quot; (Red Shepherd&#x27;s Purse) is a self-pollinating species that became self-compatible 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, indicating that self-pollination is an evolutionary adaptation that can persist over many generations. Its out-crossing progenitor was identified as &quot;Capsella grandiflora&quot;.

=== &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; ===
&quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; is a predominantly self-pollinating plant with an out-crossing rate in the wild estimated at less than 0.3%. A study suggested that self-pollination evolved roughly a million years ago or more.

===Tomato===

In the tomato plant, cleistogamy, a form of automatic self-pollination, is promoted by a modification of floral structures. This modification involves formation of a stigma enclosing floral structure.

== Possible long-term benefit of meiosis ==
Meiosis followed by self-pollination produces little overall genetic variation. This raises the question of how meiosis in self-pollinating plants is adaptively maintained over extended periods (i.e. for roughly a million years or more, as in the case of &quot;A. thaliana&quot;) in preference to a less complicated and less costly asexual ameiotic process for producing progeny. An adaptive benefit of meiosis that may explain its long-term maintenance in self-pollinating plants is efficient recombinational repair of DNA damage. This benefit can be realized at each generation (even when genetic variation is not produced).

<text>The Indian Express is an English-language Indian daily newspaper founded in 1932 by P. Varadarajulu Naidu. It is headquartered in Noida, owned by the &quot;Indian Express Group&quot;. It was later taken over by Ramnath Goenka. In 1999, eight years after Goenka&#x27;s death in 1991, the group was split between the family members. The southern editions took the name &quot;The New Indian Express&quot;, while the northern editions, based in Mumbai, retained the original &quot;Indian Express&quot; name with &quot;The&quot; prefixed to the title.

==History==

In 1932, the &quot;Indian Express&quot; was started by an Ayurvedic doctor, P. Varadarajulu Naidu, at Chennai, being published by his Tamil Nadu press. Soon under financial difficulties, he sold the newspaper to Swaminathan Sadanand, the founder of &quot;The Free Press Journal&quot;, a national news agency. In 1933, the &quot;Indian Express&quot; opened its second office in Madurai, launching the Tamil edition, &quot;Dinamani&quot;. Sadanand introduced several innovations and reduced the price of the newspaper. Faced with financial difficulties, he sold a part of his stake to Goenka as convertible debentures. In 1935, when &quot;The Free Press Journal&quot; finally collapsed, and after a protracted court battle with Goenka, Sadanand lost ownership of &quot;Indian Express&quot;. In 1939, Goenka bought &quot;Andhra Prabha&quot;, another prominent Telugu daily newspaper. The name Three Musketeers was often used for the three dailies, namely &quot;Indian Express&quot;, &quot;Dinamani&quot; and &quot;Andhra Prabha&quot;.

In 1940, the whole premises was gutted by fire. &quot;The Hindu&quot;, a rival newspaper, helped considerably in re-launching the paper, by getting it printed temporarily at one of its Swadesimithran&#x27;s press and later offered its recently vacated premises at 2 Mount Road, on rent to Goenka, which later became the landmark Express Estates. This relocation also helped the &quot;Express&quot; obtain better high speed printing machines. The district judge who led the inquiry into the fire concluded that a short circuit or cigarette butt could have ignited the fire and said that the growing city had inadequate fire control support. In 1952, the paper had a circulation of 44,469.

After Goenka&#x27;s death in 1991, two of his grandsons, Manoj Kumar Sonthalia and Viveck Goenka split the group into two. &quot;Indian Express Mumbai&quot; with all the North Indian editions went to Viveck Goenka, and all the Southern editions, which were grouped as Express Publications Madurai Limited and headquartered in Chennai, went to Sonthalia. &quot;Indian Express&quot; began publishing daily on the internet on 8 July 1996. Five months later, the website &quot;expressindia.com&quot; attracted &quot;700,000 hits every day, excepting weekends when it fell to 60% of its normal levels&quot;.

<text>In the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, grips are camera support equipment technicians in the filmmaking and video production industries. They constitute their own department on a film set and are directed by a key grip. Grips have two main functions: The first is to work closely with the camera department to provide camera support, especially if the camera is mounted to a dolly, crane, or in an unusual position, such as the top of a ladder. Some grips may specialize in operating camera dollies or camera cranes. The second function is to work closely with the electrical department to create lighting set-ups necessary for a shot under the direction of the director of photography.

In the UK, Australia and most parts of Europe, grips are not involved in lighting. In the &quot;British System&quot;, adopted throughout Europe and the Commonwealth (excluding Canada), a grip is solely responsible for camera mounting and support.

The term &quot;grip&quot; is derived from an older term in U.S. theatre where it designated stagehands who moved scenery.

U.S. grips typically belong to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). Canadian grips may also belong to IATSE or to Canada&#x27;s other professional trade unions including Toronto&#x27;s Nabet 700, or Vancouver&#x27;s ACFC. British grips usually belong to BECTU (Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph &amp; Theatre Union).

==Lighting==
On all union jobs, grips do not touch the lights themselves. The placement of lighting instruments and electric power distribution is handled by the electricians who work under a gaffer. Grips handle all the non-electrical equipment that modifies the light. This work is done by setting stands that hold flags, nets, diffusing materials or other gobos that control the quality, intensity, or shape of the light.

Grips also set &quot;passive fill&quot; which is a term for the reflected light that is &quot;bounced&quot; back onto a subject on the fill or non-key light side. The first choice for most film-makers&#x27; fill is a product known in the US as beadboard and called &quot;poly&quot;, short for polystyrene, in Europe. It is rigid insulation made for the construction trade, but was adopted by the film trade because of its &quot;true-white&quot; color and &quot;soft&quot; bounce.

Grips may also be called on to set &quot;negative fill&quot;, which is the reduction of ambient or non-directional light, such as ambient sunlight, to raise contrast on the subject. This is achieved by setting &quot;solids&quot;, made of black fabric, either flags (up to 4&#x27; × 4&#x27;) or rags (6&#x27; × 6&#x27; or larger) on the non-key light side or wherever the negative fill is desired.

When shooting day exteriors, grips perform similar functions, but with the sun as the primary light source. Grips use overhead frames up to 20&#x27; × 20&#x27; or larger for the shaping or filtering of sunlight. The lighting set-ups for these exterior shots can become quite extensive, and the use of boom lifts (called &quot;condors&quot;) is common. Condors are especially useful at night when they are rigged to raise lights or diffusing material (up to 120 feet in the air) to create moon-effect lighting.

==Rigging==
Grips also satisfy rigging needs on set. Examples of simple rigs include the &quot;menace arm&quot;, which allows a light to be boomed over set using one stand, or &quot;goalposts&quot; that span over top of set using two stands. More advanced rigs can include working with pulleys, steel cable or trusses. Grips also rig picture cars on process trailers, placing camera and lights around the vehicle for driving shots. This often includes the use of hood mounts, side mounts, suction cup mounts and proprietary clamps to attach film equipment to vehicles without causing damage.

Grips also do &quot;blackouts&quot; and &quot;tenting-out&quot; windows and doors. When shooting interiors day-for-night on location, grips need to eliminate all daylight entering the set. If windows or other openings are not visible in a shot, the light may be blacked out with a cloth known as duvetyne or rags, and in rare cases, plastic sheeting. When windows or doors are seen from camera, black out tents must be created outside of windows to allow lights to be placed outside, or green screens to be seen through the window, lit only by lights placed by electricians.

==Safety==
Grips are also responsible for safety on the set as it relates to the force of gravity. Insofar as stands, ladders, scaffolds, and overhead rigs are properly installed, grips are charged with making them safe because the other crew members must climb on, walk around, or otherwise negotiate the different grip set-ups. The key grip may even be held responsible for injuries that happen on set, especially if the injury is caused by a falling lighting instrument.

==Tools==
A grip uses some tools typically used by mechanics and construction workers. As in those vocations, grips need hand tools at the ready.(Tools such as ratchet straps, wedges and a normal tool box)

==Common terms used by and for grips==

Nemours Jean-Baptiste (February 2, 1918 – May 18, 1985) was a Haitian saxophonist, writer, and band leader. He is credited with being the inventor of &quot;compas&quot;, also known as &quot;compas direct&quot;, a style of Haitian music.

Nemours nicknamed &quot;maestro&quot; married Marie-Félicité Olivier with whom he had two daughters, Yvrose, Marie-Denise and a son, Yves-Nemours.
Nemours dedicated many songs to his friends and fans. The 1967 composition &quot;Ti Carole&quot;, dedicated to his fan Kouri, became famous and is still a favorite.

In the early sixties, many of the Group Compas Direct&#x27;s compositions were in praise of women and healthy relationships &quot;Ti Carole&quot; was one of the famous hit that remains amongst the Top ten list for over a year. Nemours and the Group performed at several New York night club in the early seventies.

==Rivalry with Webert Sicot==
During Jean-Baptiste&#x27;s early career, he played in a band with fellow Haitian artist Webert Sicot called Conjunto Internacional. Years after the band dissolved, Webert Sicot introduced a new dance rhythm that bore many similarities to Jean-Baptiste&#x27;s compas. During the period of argument and controversy that followed, the two took lyrical jabs at each other in their songs. The competition between the two culminated in a soccer match between the two artists and their respective bands, which ended in a 1–1 tie.

<text>Zhang Qian (; died c. 114 BC) was a Chinese diplomat, explorer, and politician who served as an imperial envoy to the world outside of China in the late 2nd century BC during the Western Han dynasty. He was one of the first official diplomats to bring back valuable information about Central Asia, including the Greco-Bactrian remains of the Macedonian Empire as well as the Parthian Empire, to the Han dynasty imperial court, then ruled by Emperor Wu of Han.

He played an important pioneering role for the future Chinese conquest of lands west of Xinjiang, including swaths of Central Asia and even lands south of the Hindu Kush (see Protectorate of the Western Regions). This trip created the Silk Road that marked the beginning of globalization between the countries in the east and west.

Zhang Qian&#x27;s travel was commissioned by Emperor Wu with the major goal of initiating transcontinental trade in the Silk Road, as well as create political protectorates by securing allies. His missions opened trade routes between East and West and exposed different products and kingdoms to each other through trade. Zhang&#x27;s accounts were compiled by Sima Qian in the 1st century BC. The Central Asian parts of the Silk Road routes were expanded around 114 BC largely through the missions of and exploration by Zhang Qian. Today, Zhang is considered a Chinese national hero and revered for the key role he played in opening China and the countries of the known world to the wider opportunity of commercial trade and global alliances. Zhang Qian is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.

==Zhang Qian&#x27;s Missions==

Zhang Qian was born in Chenggu district just east of Hanzhong in the north-central province of Shaanxi, China. He entered the capital, Chang&#x27;an, (today Xi&#x27;an), between 140 BC and 134 BC as a Gentleman (), serving Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty. At the time the nomadic Xiongnu tribes controlled what is now Inner Mongolia and dominated the Western Regions, Xiyu (), the areas neighbouring the territory of the Han dynasty. The Han emperor was interested in establishing commercial ties with distant lands but outside contact was prevented by the hostile Xiongnu.

The Han court dispatched Zhang Qian, a military officer who was familiar with the Xiongnu, to the Western Regions in 138 BC with a group of ninety-nine members to make contact and build an alliance with the Yuezhi against the Xiongnu. He was accompanied by a guide named Ganfu (), a Xiongnu who had been captured in war. The objective of Zhang Qian&#x27;s first mission was to seek a military alliance with the Yuezhi, in modern Tajikistan. However to get to the territory of the Yuezhi he was forced to pass through land controlled by the Xiongnu who captured him (as well as Ganfu) and enslaved him for thirteen years. During this time he married a Xiongnu wife, who bore him a son, and gained the trust of the Xiongnu leader.

Zhang and Ganfu (as well as Zhang&#x27;s Xiongnu wife and son) were eventually able to escape and, passing Lop Nor and following the northern edge of the Tarim Basin, around the Kunlun Mountains and through small fortified areas in the middle of oases in what is now Xinjiang until they made their way to Dayuan and eventually to the land of the Yuezhi. The Yuezhi were agricultural people who produced strong horses and many unknown crops including alfalfa for animal fodder. However, the Yuezhi were too settled to desire war against the Xiongnu. Zhang spent a year in Yuezhi and the adjacent Bactrian territory, documenting their cultures, lifestyles and economy, before beginning his return trip to China, this time following the southern edge of the Tarim Basin.
On his return trip he was again captured by the Xiongnu who again spared his life because they valued his sense of duty and composure in the face of death. Two years later the Xiongnu leader died and in the midst of chaos and infighting Zhang Qian escaped. Of the original mission of just over a hundred men, only Zhang Qian and Ganfu managed to return to China.

Zhang Qian returned in 125 BC with detailed news for the Emperor, showing that sophisticated civilizations existed to the West, with which China could advantageously develop relations. The Shiji relates that &quot;the Emperor learned of the Dayuan (大宛), Daxia (大夏), Anxi (安息), and the others, all great states rich in unusual products whose people cultivated the land and made their living in much the same way as the Chinese. All these states, he was told, were militarily weak and prized Han goods and wealth&quot;. Upon Zhang Qian&#x27;s return to China he was honoured with a position of palace counsellor. Although he was unable to develop commercial ties between China and these far-off lands, his efforts did eventually result in trade mission to the Wusun people in 119 BC which led to trade between China and Persia.

On his mission Zhang Qian had noticed products from an area now known as northern India. However, the task remained to find a trade route not obstructed by the Xiongnu to India. Zhang Qian set out on a second mission to forge a route from China to India via Sichuan, but after many attempts this effort proved unsuccessful. In 119–115 BC Zhang Qian was sent on a third mission by the emperor, to develop ties with the Wusun () people.

==Zhang Qian&#x27;s reports==

The reports of Zhang Qian&#x27;s travels are quoted extensively in the 1st century BC Chinese historic chronicles &quot;Records of the Great Historian&quot; (Shiji) by Sima Qian. Zhang Qian visited directly the kingdom of Dayuan () in Fergana, the territories of the Yuezhi () in Transoxiana, the Bactrian country of Daxia () with its remnants of Greco-Bactrian rule, and Kangju (). He also made reports on neighbouring countries that he did not visit, such as Anxi () (Arsacid territories), Tiaozhi (條支/条支) (Seleucid Empire in Mesopotamia), Shendu () (India) and the Wusun ().

===Dayuan (大宛, Ferghana)===
After being released from captivity by Xiongnu, Zhang Qian visited Dayuan, located in the Fergana region west of the Tarim Basin. The people of Dayuan were being portrayed as sophisticated urban dwellers similar to the Parthians and the Bactrians. The name Dayuan is thought to be a transliteration of the word &quot;Yona&quot;, the Greek descendants that occupied the region from the 4th to the 2nd century BCE. It was during this stay that Zhang reported the famous tall and powerful &quot;blood-sweating&quot; Ferghana horse. The refusal by Dayuan to offer these horses to Emperor Wu of Han resulted in two punitive campaigns launched by the Han dynasty to acquire these horses by force.

:&quot;Dayuan lies south-west of the territory of the Xiongnu, some 10,000 &quot;li&quot; directly west of China. The people are settled on the land, ploughing the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. The people live in houses in fortified cities, there being some seventy or more cities of various sizes in the region. The population numbers several hundred thousand&quot; (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).

Later the Han dynasty conquered the region in the War of the Heavenly Horses.

===Yuezhi (月氏)===
After obtaining the help of the king of Dayuan, Zhang Qian went south-west to the territory of the Yuezhi, with whom he was supposed to obtain a military alliance against the Xiongnu.

:&quot;The Great Yuezhi live some 2,000 or 3,000 li west of Dayuan, north of the Gui (Oxus) river. They are bordered to the south by Daxia (Bactria), on the west by Anxi, and on the north by Kangju (康居). They are a nation of nomads, moving place to place with their herds and their customs are like those of the Xiongnu. They have some 100,000 or 200,000 archer warriors.&quot; (adapted from Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).

Zhang Qian also describes the origins of the Yuezhi, explaining they came from the eastern part of the Tarim Basin. This has encouraged some historians to connect them to the Caucasoid mummies of the Tarim. (The question of links between the Yuezhi and the Tocharians of the Tarim is still debatable.)

:&quot;The Yuezhi originally lived in the area between the Qilian or Heavenly Mountains (Tian Shan) and Dunhuang, but after they were defeated by the Xiongnu they moved far away to the west, beyond Dayuan (Ferghana), where they attacked the people of Daxia (Bactria) and set up the court of their king on the northern bank of the Gui (Oxus) river.&quot; (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).

A smaller group of Yuezhi, the &quot;Little Yuezhi&quot;, were not able to follow the exodus and reportedly found refuge among the &quot;Qiang barbarians&quot;.

Zhang was the first Chinese to write about one humped dromedary camels which he saw in this region.

===Daxia (大夏, Bactria)===
Zhang Qian probably witnessed the last period of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, as it was being subjugated by the nomadic Yuezhi. Only small powerless chiefs remained, who were apparently vassals to the Yuezhi horde. Their civilization was urban, almost identical to the civilizations of Anxi and Dayuan, and the population was numerous.

:&quot;Daxia is situated over 2,000 &quot;li&quot; south-west of Dayuan (Ferghana), south of the Gui (Oxus) river. Its people cultivate the land, and have cities and houses. Their customs are like those of Dayuan. It has no great ruler but only a number of petty chiefs ruling the various cities. The people are poor in the use of arms and afraid of battle, but they are clever at commerce. After the Great Yuezhi moved west and attacked and conquered Daxia, the entire country came under their sway. The population of the country is large, numbering some 1,000,000 or more persons. The capital is Lanshi (Bactra) where all sorts of goods are bought and sold.&quot; (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, translation Burton Watson).

Cloth from Shu (Sichuan) was found there.

===Shendu (身毒, India)===
Zhang Qian also reports about the existence of India south-east of Bactria. The name &quot;Shendu&quot; () comes from the Sanskrit word &quot;Sindhu&quot;, meaning the Indus river. Sindh was at the time ruled by Indo-Greek Kingdoms, which explains the reported cultural similarity between Bactria and India:

:&quot;Southeast of Daxia is the kingdom of Shendu (India)... Shendu, they told me, lies several thousand &quot;li&quot; south-east of Daxia (Bactria). The people cultivate the land and live much like the people of Daxia. The region is said to be hot and damp. The inhabitants ride elephants when they go in battle. The kingdom is situated on a great river (Indus)&quot; (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).

===Anxi (安息, Parthia)===

Zhang Qian identifies &quot;Anxi&quot; () as an advanced urban civilization, like Dayuan (Ferghana) and Daxia (Bactria). The name &quot;Anxi&quot; is a transcription of &quot;Arshak&quot; (Arsaces), the name of the founder of Arsacid Empire that ruled the regions along the Silk Road between the Tedzhen river in the east and the Tigris in the west, and running through Aria, Parthia proper, and Media proper.

:&quot;Anxi is situated several thousand &quot;li&quot; west of the region of the Great Yuezhi. The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of Dayuan (Ferghana), the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To the west lies Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) and to the north Yancai and Lixuan (Hyrcania).&quot; (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).

===Tiaozhi (条支, Seleucid Empire in Mesopotamia)===
Zhang Qian&#x27;s reports on Mesopotamia and the Seleucid Empire, or Tiaozhi (), are in tenuous terms. He did not himself visit the region, and was only able to report what others told him.

:&quot;Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia) is situated several thousand &quot;li&quot; west of Anxi (Arsacid territory) and borders the &quot;Western Sea&quot; (which could refer to the Persian Gulf or Mediterranean). It is hot and damp, and the people live by cultivating the fields and planting rice... The people are very numerous and are ruled by many petty chiefs. The ruler of Anxi (the Arsacids) give orders to these chiefs and regards them as vassals.&quot; (adapted from Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).

===Kangju (康居) northwest of Sogdiana (粟特)===

Zhang Qian also visited directly the area of Sogdiana (Kangju), home to the Sogdian nomads:

:&quot;Kangju is situated some 2,000 li north-west of Dayuan (Bactria). Its people are nomads and resemble the Yuezhi in their customs. They have 80,000 or 90,000 skilled archer fighters. The country is small, and borders Dayuan. It acknowledges sovereignty to the Yuezhi people in the South and the Xiongnu in the East.&quot; (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).

===Yancai (奄蔡, Vast Steppe)===
:&quot;Yancai lies some 2,000 &quot;li&quot; north-west of Kangju (centered on Turkestan at Beitian). The people are nomads and their customs are generally similar to those of the people of Kangju. The country has over 100,000 archer warriors, and borders a great shore-less lake, perhaps what is now known as the Northern Sea (Aral Sea, distance between Tashkent to Aralsk is about 866 km)&quot; (Shiji, 123, Zhang Qian quote, trans. Burton Watson).

==Development of East-West contacts==
Following Zhang Qian&#x27;s embassy and report, commercial relations between China and Central as well as Western Asia flourished, as many Chinese missions were sent throughout the end of the 2nd century BC and the 1st century BC, initiating the development of the Silk Road:
:&quot;The largest of these embassies to foreign states numbered several hundred persons, while even the smaller parties included over 100 members... In the course of one year anywhere from five to six to over ten parties would be sent out.&quot; (Shiji, trans. Burton Watson).

Many objects were soon exchanged, and travelled as far as Guangzhou in the East, as suggested by the discovery of a Persian box and various artefacts from Central Asia in the 122 BC tomb of King Zhao Mo of Nanyue.
Murals in Mogao Caves in Dunhuang describe the Emperor Han Wudi (156–87 BC) worshipping Buddhist statues, explaining them as &quot;golden men brought in 120 BC by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads&quot;, although there is no other mention of Han Wudi worshipping the Buddha in Chinese historical literature.

China also sent a mission to Anxi, which were followed up by reciprocal missions from Parthian envoys around 100 BC:
:&quot;When the Han envoy first visited the kingdom of Anxi, the king of Anxi (the Arsacid ruler) dispatched a party of 20,000 horsemen to meet them on the eastern border of the kingdom... When the Han envoys set out again to return to China, the king of Anxi dispatched envoys of his own to accompany them... The emperor was delighted at this.&quot; (adapted from Shiji, 123, trans. Burton Watson).

The Roman historian Florus describes the visit of numerous envoys, including &quot;Seres&quot; (Chinese or central Asians), to the first Roman Emperor Augustus, who reigned between 27 BC and 14:
:&quot;Even the rest of the nations of the world which were not subject to the imperial sway were sensible of its grandeur, and looked with reverence to the Roman people, the great conqueror of nations. Thus even Scythians and Sarmatians sent envoys to seek the friendship of Rome. Nay, the Seres came likewise, and the Indians who dwelt beneath the vertical sun, bringing presents of precious stones and pearls and elephants, but thinking all of less moment than the vastness of the journey which they had undertaken, and which they said had occupied four years. In truth it needed but to look at their complexion to see that they were people of another world than ours.&quot; (&quot;Cathay and the way thither&quot;, Henry Yule).

In 97, the Chinese general Ban Chao dispatched an envoy to Rome in the person of Gan Ying.

Several Roman embassies to China followed from 166, and are officially recorded in Chinese historical chronicles.

==Final years and legacy==

The &quot;Shiji&quot; reports that Zhang Qian returned from his final expedition to the Wusun in 115 BC. After his return he &quot;was honoured with the post of grand messenger, making him among the nine highest ministers of the government. A year or so later he died.&quot;
&quot;The indications regarding the year of his passing differ, but Shih Chih-mien (1961), p. 268 shows beyond doubt that he died in 113 B.C. His tomb is situated in Chang-chia ts&#x27;un 張家村 near Ch&#x27;eng-ku . . . ; during repairs carried out in 1945 a clay mold with the inscription 博望家造 [Home of the Bowang (Marquis)] was found, as reported by Ch&#x27;en Chih (1959), p. 162.&quot; Hulsewé and Loewe (1979), p. 218, note 819.

==Other achievements==
From his missions he brought back many important products, the most important being alfalfa seeds (for growing horse fodder), strong horses with hard hooves, and knowledge of the extensive existence of new products, peoples and technologies of the outside world. He died &quot;c&quot;. 114 BC after spending twenty-five years travelling on these dangerous and strategic missions. Although at a time in his life he was regarded with disgrace for being defeated by the Xiongnu, by the time of his passing he had been bestowed with great honours by the emperor.

Zhang Qian&#x27;s journeys had promoted a great variety of economic and cultural exchanges between the Han dynasty and the Western Regions. Because silk became the dominant product traded from China, this great trade route later became known as the Silk Road.

<doc id="407247" wikidata="Q1054156" url="?curid=407247" title="Three marks of existence">
<text>In Buddhism, the three marks of existence are three characteristics (Pali: &quot;tilakkhaṇa&quot;; Sanskrit: त्रिलक्षण &quot;trilakṣaṇa&quot;) of all existence and beings, namely &quot;anicca&quot; (impermanence), &quot;dukkha&quot; (commonly translated as &quot;suffering&quot; or &quot;cause of suffering&quot;, &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, &quot;unease&quot;), and &quot;anattā&quot; (without a lasting essence). The concept of humans being subject to delusion about the three marks, this delusion resulting in suffering, and removal of that delusion resulting in the end of dukkha, is a central theme in the Buddhist Four Noble Truths, the last of which leads to the Noble Eightfold Path.

==Description==
There are different lists of the &quot;marks of existence&quot; found in the canons of the early Buddhist schools.

=== Three marks ===
In the Pali tradition of the Theravada school, the three marks are:
* &quot;sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā&quot; – all &quot;saṅkhāras&quot; (conditioned things) are impermanent
* &quot;sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā&quot; – all &quot;saṅkhāras&quot; are unsatisfactory, imperfect, unstable
* &quot;sabbe dhammā anattā&quot; – all &quot;dharmas&quot; (conditioned or unconditioned things) have no unchanging self or soul
The northern Buddhist Sarvāstivāda tradition meanwhile has the following in their &quot;Samyukta Agama&quot;:
* All conditioned things are impermanent (&quot;sarvasaṃskārā anityāḥ&quot;)
* All dharmas are non-self (&quot;sarvadharmā anātmānaḥ)&quot;
* Nirvāṇa is calm (&quot;śāntaṃ nirvāṇam&quot;)

=== Four marks ===
In the &quot;Ekottarika-āgama&quot; and in Mahayana sources like the &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra&quot; and &quot;The Questions of the Nāga King Sāgara&quot; &quot;(Sāgaranāgarājaparipṛcchā)&quot; however, four characteristics or “four seals of the Dharma” (Sanskrit: &quot;dharmoddāna-catuṣṭayaṃ&quot; or &quot;catvāri dharmapadāni&quot;, Chinese: 四法印) are described instead of three:
* All compounded phenomena are impermanent (&quot;anitya&quot;)
* All contaminated phenomena are without satisfaction (&quot;duḥkha&quot;)
* All phenomena are without self (&quot;anātman&quot;)
* Nirvana is peaceful/peace (&quot;śānta/śānti&quot;)

==Explanation==
===Anicca===

Impermanence (Pali: &quot;anicca&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;anitya&quot;) means that all things (&quot;saṅkhāra&quot;) are in a constant state of flux. Buddhism states that all physical and mental events come into being and dissolve. Human life embodies this flux in the aging process and the cycle of repeated birth and death (Samsara); nothing lasts, and everything decays. This is applicable to all beings and their environs, including beings who are reborn in deva (god) and naraka (hell) realms. This is in contrast to nirvana, the reality that is &quot;nicca&quot;, or knows no change, decay or death.

===Dukkha===

&quot;Dukkha&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;duhkha&quot;) means &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, commonly translated as &quot;suffering&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;. Mahasi Sayadaw calls it &#x27;unmanagable, uncontrollable&#x27;.

As the First Noble Truth, &quot;dukkha&quot; is explicated as the physical and mental dissatisfaction of changing conditions as in birth, aging, illness, death; getting what one wishes to avoid or not getting what one wants; and &quot;in short, the five aggregates of clinging and grasping&quot; (&quot;skandha&quot;). This, however, is a different context, not the Three Marks of Existence, and therefore &#x27;suffering&#x27; may not be the best word for it.

The relationship between the three characteristics is explained in the Pali Canon as follows: What is &quot;anicca&quot; is &quot;dukkha&quot;. What is &quot;dukkha&quot; is &quot;anatta&quot; (Samyutta Nikaya.Vol4.Page1).
* &quot;That which is impermanent is &quot;dukkha&quot; (i.e. it cannot be made to last). That which is &quot;dukkha&quot; is not permanent.&quot;

===Anatta===

&quot;Anatta&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;anatman&quot;) refers to there being no permanent essence in any thing or phenomena, including living beings.

While &quot;anicca&quot; and &quot;dukkha&quot; apply to &quot;all conditioned phenomena&quot; (&quot;saṅkhārā&quot;), &quot;anattā&quot; has a wider scope because it applies to all &quot;dhammās&quot; without the &quot;conditioned, unconditioned&quot; qualification. Thus, &quot;nirvana&quot; too is a state of without Self or &quot;anatta&quot;. The phrase &quot;sabbe dhamma anatta&quot; includes within its scope each &quot;skandha&quot; (group of aggregates, heaps) that compose any being, and the belief &quot;I am&quot; is a conceit which must be realized to be impermanent and without substance, to end all &quot;dukkha&quot;.

The &quot;anattā&quot; doctrine of Buddhism denies that there is anything permanent in any person to call one&#x27;s Self, and that a belief in a Self is a source of &quot;dukkha&quot;. Some Buddhist traditions and scholars, however, interpret the &quot;anatta&quot; doctrine to be strictly in regard to the five aggregates rather than a universal truth. Religious studies scholar Alexander Wynne calls &quot;anattā&quot; a &quot;not-self&quot; teaching rather than a &quot;no-self&quot; teaching.

==Application==
In Buddhism, ignorance (&quot;avidyā&quot;, or &quot;moha&quot;; i.e. a failure to grasp directly) of the three marks of existence is regarded as the first link in the overall process of &quot;saṃsāra&quot; whereby a being is subject to repeated existences in an endless cycle of dukkha. As a consequence, dissolving that ignorance through direct insight into the three marks is said to bring an end to &quot;saṃsāra&quot; and, as a result, to that &quot;dukkha&quot; (&quot;dukkha nirodha&quot; or &quot;nirodha sacca&quot;, as described in the third of the Four Noble Truths).

Gautama Buddha taught that all beings conditioned by causes (&quot;saṅkhāra&quot;) are impermanent (&quot;anicca&quot;) and suffering (&quot;dukkha&quot;), and that not-self (&quot;anattā&quot;) characterises all &quot;dhammas&quot;, meaning there is no &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, or &quot;mine&quot; in either the conditioned or the unconditioned (i.e. &quot;nibbāna&quot;). The teaching of three marks of existence in the Pali Canon is credited to the Buddha.

<doc id="407249" wikidata="Q915474" url="?curid=407249" title="Divisor function">
<text>In mathematics, and specifically in number theory, a divisor function is an arithmetic function related to the divisors of an integer. When referred to as &quot;the&quot; divisor function, it counts the &quot;number of divisors of an integer&quot; (including 1 and the number itself). It appears in a number of remarkable identities, including relationships on the Riemann zeta function and the Eisenstein series of modular forms. Divisor functions were studied by Ramanujan, who gave a number of important congruences and identities; these are treated separately in the article Ramanujan&#x27;s sum.

A related function is the divisor summatory function, which, as the name implies, is a sum over the divisor function.

==Definition==
The sum of positive divisors function &quot;σ&quot;&quot;z&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), for a real or complex number &quot;z&quot;, is defined as the sum of the &quot;z&quot;th powers of the positive divisors of &quot;n&quot;. It can be expressed in sigma notation as

:formula_1

where formula_2 is shorthand for &quot;&quot;d&quot; divides &quot;n&quot;&quot;.
The notations &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and &quot;τ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) (for the German &quot;Teiler&quot; = divisors) are also used to denote &quot;σ&quot;0(&quot;n&quot;), or the number-of-divisors function (). When &quot;z&quot; is 1, the function is called the sigma function or sum-of-divisors function, and the subscript is often omitted, so &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the same as &quot;σ&quot;1(&quot;n&quot;) ().

The aliquot sum &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of &quot;n&quot; is the sum of the proper divisors (that is, the divisors excluding &quot;n&quot; itself, ), and equals &quot;σ&quot;1(&quot;n&quot;) − &quot;n&quot;; the aliquot sequence of &quot;n&quot; is formed by repeatedly applying the aliquot sum function.

==Example==
For example, &quot;σ&quot;0(12) is the number of the divisors of 12:

: formula_3

while &quot;σ&quot;1(12) is the sum of all the divisors:

: formula_4

and the aliquot sum s(12) of proper divisors is:

: formula_5

&quot;σ&quot;−1(&quot;n&quot;) is sometimes called the abundancy index of &quot;n&quot;, and we have:

: formula_6

==Table of values==
The cases &quot;x&quot; = 2 to 5 are listed in through , &quot;x&quot; = 6 to 24 are listed in through .

For a prime number &quot;p&quot;,

:formula_7

because by definition, the factors of a prime number are 1 and itself. Also, where &quot;pn&quot;# denotes the primorial,

:formula_8

since &quot;n&quot; prime factors allow a sequence of binary selection (formula_9 or 1) from &quot;n&quot; terms for each proper divisor formed. However, these are not in general the smallest numbers whose number of divisors is a power of two; instead, the smallest such number may be obtained by multiplying together the first &quot;n&quot; Fermi–Dirac primes, prime powers whose exponent is a power of two.

Clearly, formula_10 for all formula_11, and formula_12 for all formula_13, formula_14 .

The divisor function is multiplicative (since each divisor &quot;c&quot; of the product &quot;mn&quot; with formula_15 distinctively correspond to a divisor &quot;a&quot; of &quot;m&quot; and a divisor &quot;b&quot; of &quot;n&quot;), but not completely multiplicative:

:formula_16

The consequence of this is that, if we write

:formula_17

where &quot;r&quot; = &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the number of distinct prime factors of &quot;n&quot;, &quot;pi&quot; is the &quot;i&quot;th prime factor, and &quot;ai&quot; is the maximum power of &quot;pi&quot; by which &quot;n&quot; is divisible, then we have: 

:formula_18

which, when &quot;x&quot; ≠ 0, is equivalent to the useful formula: 

:formula_19

When &quot;x&quot; = 0, formula_20 is: 

:formula_21

This result can be directly deduced from the fact that all divisors of formula_22 are uniquely determined by the distinct tuples formula_23 of integers with formula_24 (i.e. formula_25 independent choices for each formula_26).

For example, if &quot;n&quot; is 24, there are two prime factors (&quot;p&quot;1 is 2; &quot;p&quot;2 is 3); noting that 24 is the product of 23×31, &quot;a&quot;1 is 3 and &quot;a&quot;2 is 1. Thus we can calculate formula_27 as so:

: formula_28

The eight divisors counted by this formula are 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, and 24.

===Other properties and identities===
Euler proved the remarkable recurrence:

:formula_29

where formula_30 if it occurs and formula_31 for formula_32, and formula_33 are consecutive pairs of generalized pentagonal numbers (, starting at offset 1). Indeed, Euler proved this by logarithmic differentiation of the identity in his pentagonal number theorem.

For a non-square integer, &quot;n&quot;, every divisor, &quot;d&quot;, of &quot;n&quot; is paired with divisor &quot;n&quot;/&quot;d&quot; of &quot;n&quot; and formula_34 is even; for a square integer, one divisor (namely formula_35) is not paired with a distinct divisor and formula_34 is odd. Similarly, the number formula_37 is odd if and only if &quot;n&quot; is a square or twice a square.

We also note &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) − &quot;n&quot;. Here &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) denotes the sum of the &quot;proper&quot; divisors of &quot;n&quot;, that is, the divisors of &quot;n&quot; excluding &quot;n&quot; itself. This function is used to recognize perfect numbers, which are the &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;. If &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &gt; &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; is an abundant number, and if &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) &lt; &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; is a deficient number.

If is a power of 2, formula_38, then formula_39 and formula_40, which makes &quot;n&quot; almost-perfect.

As an example, for two primes formula_41, let

:formula_42.

Then

:formula_43
:formula_44

and

:formula_45
:formula_46

where formula_47 is Euler&#x27;s totient function.

Then, the roots of

:formula_48

express &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; in terms of &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) only, requiring no knowledge of &quot;n&quot; or formula_49, as

:formula_50
:formula_51

Also, knowing and either formula_52 or formula_47, or, alternatively, formula_49 and either formula_52 or formula_47 allows an easy recovery of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.

In 1984, Roger Heath-Brown proved that the equality

:formula_57

is true for infinitely many values of , see .

=== Dirichlet convolutions ===

By definition:formula_58By Möbius inversion:formula_59

==Series relations==
Two Dirichlet series involving the divisor function are: 

:formula_60

where formula_61 is the Riemann zeta function. The series for &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;σ&quot;0(&quot;n&quot;) gives: 

: formula_62

and a Ramanujan identity

:formula_63

which is a special case of the Rankin–Selberg convolution.

A Lambert series involving the divisor function is: 

:formula_64

for arbitrary complex |&quot;q&quot;| ≤ 1 and &quot;a&quot;. This summation also appears as the Fourier series of the Eisenstein series and the invariants of the Weierstrass elliptic functions.

For formula_65, there is an explicit series representation with Ramanujan sums formula_66 as :
:formula_67
The computation of the first terms of formula_68 shows its oscillations around the &quot;average value&quot; formula_69:
:formula_70

==Growth rate==
In little-o notation, the divisor function satisfies the inequality:
:formula_71
More precisely, Severin Wigert showed that:
:formula_72
On the other hand, since there are infinitely many prime numbers,
:formula_73

In Big-O notation, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet showed that the average order of the divisor function satisfies the following inequality:
:formula_74
where formula_75 is Euler&#x27;s gamma constant. Improving the bound formula_76 in this formula is known as Dirichlet&#x27;s divisor problem.

The behaviour of the sigma function is irregular. The asymptotic growth rate of the sigma function can be expressed by: 
:formula_77

where lim sup is the limit superior. This result is Grönwall&#x27;s theorem, published in 1913 . His proof uses Mertens&#x27; third theorem, which says that:

:formula_78

where &quot;p&quot; denotes a prime.

In 1915, Ramanujan proved that under the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis, Robin&#x27;s inequality
:formula_79 (where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant)
holds for all sufficiently large &quot;n&quot; . The largest known value that violates the inequality is &quot;n&quot;=5040. In 1984, Guy Robin proved that the inequality is true for all &quot;n&quot; &gt; 5040 if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true . This is Robin&#x27;s theorem and the inequality became known after him. Robin furthermore showed that if the Riemann hypothesis is false then there are an infinite number of values of &quot;n&quot; that violate the inequality, and it is known that the smallest such &quot;n&quot; &gt; 5040 must be superabundant . It has been shown that the inequality holds for large odd and square-free integers, and that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the inequality just for &quot;n&quot; divisible by the fifth power of a prime .

Robin also proved, unconditionally, that the inequality:
:formula_80
holds for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3.

A related bound was given by Jeffrey Lagarias in 2002, who proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that:
:formula_81
for every natural number &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, where formula_82 is the &quot;n&quot;th harmonic number, .

<doc id="407255" wikidata="Q6314346" url="?curid=407255" title="Junta (album)">
<text>Junta ( ) is the first studio album by the American rock band Phish. It was self-released by the band in May 1989 on cassette without the support from a record label, and later received a wider release when Elektra Records reissued it on compact disc in 1992. While &quot;Junta&quot; was preceded by two demo recordings – &quot;The White Tape&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday&quot; (1987) – which circulated among the band&#x27;s fanbase, &quot;Junta&quot; is the band&#x27;s first professionally recorded album. Much of the album consists of complex, multi-part suites influenced by progressive rock and jazz rock.

==Recording==
The album was independently recorded at Euphoria Sound Studio, now known as Sound &amp; Vision Media, in Revere, MA by engineer Gordon Hookailo. Some of the recording was documented on video tape by studio owner Howard Cook. The album is named after Ben &quot;Junta&quot; Hunter, the band&#x27;s first official manager, whose nickname is pronounced with a hard J and a short U.

In addition to a few more traditionally structured songs, &quot;Junta&quot; contains symphonic-like epics and multi-part progressive rock and jazz suites.

==Release==
The recording was released on tape in 1988, and did not appear in stores officially until May 8, 1989. Phish held a release party concert for the &quot;Junta&quot; tape on May 9, 1989 at The Front club in their native Burlington, Vermont. The album was re-released by Elektra Records on October 26, 1992. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on October 9, 1997, and was certified platinum on July 7, 2004. In February 2009, the album became available as a download.

&quot;Union Federal&quot;, &quot;Sanity&quot;, and &quot;Icculus&quot; did not appear on the original cassette release, but rather only on the Elektra version, which had extra space on the CD format. &quot;Union Federal&quot; was taken from a jam session, while &quot;Sanity&quot; and &quot;Icculus&quot; were recorded live on July 25, 1988. There was a mix up in adding them to the Elektra version post-date, so the May 3, 1988 date inside the album notes is incorrect. The 2009 digital download also contained these three extra tracks, while the 2012 re-releases did not contain the extra tracks, as these were not part of the original album&#x27;s stereo master reels. Other songs of the recording era include &quot;Slave To The Traffic Light&quot; and &quot;Alumni Blues&quot;, both of which did not make it on the album or get a studio recording, but are live staples and appeared on &quot;The White Tape&quot; (1986).

==2012 vinyl reissue==
On February 13, 2012, it was announced that &quot;Junta&quot; would be released on vinyl for the first time on April 21, 2012 as a limited edition 3-LP vinyl set, as part of Record Store Day. The set was limited to 5,000 individually numbered copies. The vinyl release was created from the original stereo master reels and includes a free MP3 download of the entire album, transferred from the new vinyl master. Two digital transfers were also made from the original stereo master reels, one recorded at 24 bit / 96 kHz, and a second digital transfer recorded at 24 bit / 192 kHz. On this new release &quot;Contact&quot; is restored to its full length as on the original cassette release.

==Track listing==

Notes: 

*The original cassette release contains &quot;Fee&quot; through &quot;Dinner and a Movie&quot; on side one, and &quot;The Divided Sky&quot; through &quot;Contact&quot; on side two.
*Tracks 4–6 on disc two are bonus tracks exclusive to CD editions of the album.
*Certain pressings of the album contain an extended version of &quot;Contact&quot;.

<text>Manuel Ricardo Palma Soriano (February 7, 1833 – October 6, 1919) was a Peruvian author, scholar, librarian and politician. His magnum opus is the &quot;Tradiciones peruanas&quot;.

== Biography ==
According to the official account, Manuel Ricardo Palma y Carrillo was born on February 7, 1833, in Lima, inscribed as the son of Pedro Ramón Palma and Guillerma Carrillo y Pardos, possibly his grandmother. On April 6, 1837, his father married Dominga Soriano y Carrillo, Guillerma&#x27;s daughter. However, the documentary evidence shows many contradictions that was pointed out by Monsignor Salvador Herrera Pinto who relying on oral traditions collected and written testimonies directed to him (a catholic bishop) concludes that Ricardo Palma was born in the town of Talavera, province of Andahuaylas, Apurímac Region.

His family was living in Lima after migrating from the province. His mother was a mestiza with African roots. His parents separated when he was still young. He was educated at a Jesuit school and attended the University of San Carlos on an irregular basis. He suspended his studies to perform voluntary service in the Peruvian navy for six years.

From a young age, he dabbled in politics as a member of the liberal camp. In 1860 he, among others, such as José Gálvez Egúsquiza, was believed to have participated in a failed plot against president Ramón Castilla which resulted in an exile to Chile from which he returned in October 1862. He made a trip to Europe in 1864–1865 and when he returned to Lima in 1865 he became involved again in political affairs and public service until 1876. He held the positions of Consul of Peru in Pará, Brazil, Senator for the Loreto and official in the Ministry of War and Navy.

The War of the Pacific (1879–1883) between Chile and Peru disrupted Palma&#x27;s life and resulted in the virtually complete destruction of his own library as well as that housed in the National Library of Peru. After the war, Palma was named the director of the National Library, a post he held until his retirement in 1912. Palma successfully took on the task of rebuilding the National Library that was ransacked by the occupation forces of the Chilean Army in 1881 following the battle of Lima during the War of the Pacific. Palma was able to bring the National Library back from the ashes so that it regained its previous stature and became recognized once again as one of the top libraries in South America. It was through his personal friendship with the then Chilean president Domingo Santa María that Palma was able to recover an estimated 10,000 books from Chilean hands, as well as many other works which were recovered through his own personal efforts.

With his lover Clemencia Ramírez in 1872, he had his son Clemente Palma, who became a prominent writer of fantastic tales, usually horror stories, that were influenced by Edgar Allan Poe. In 1876, he married Cristina Román y Olivier with whom he had seven children: Félix Vital, Angélica, Ricardo, Peregrina Augusta, Cristina, Cristián and Renée Cristina. His daughter Angélica Palma was also a writer and a member of the early feminist movement in Peru.

== Literary work ==
Ricardo Palma published his first verses and became the editor of a political and satiric newssheet called &quot;El Diablo&quot; (The Devil) at 15.

During his early years, Ricardo Palma composed romantic dramas (which he later repudiated) and poetry. His first book of verse, &quot;Poesías&quot; (Poems), appeared in 1855. He gained an early reputation as a historian with his book on the activities of the Spanish Inquisition during the period of the Viceroyalty of Peru (&quot;Anales De La Inquisicion De Lima: Estudio Historico&quot;, 1863).

He also wrote for the satirical press of Peru where he distinguished himself as a prolific columnist and one of the bastions of Peruvian political satire in the nineteenth century. He collaborated with the satirical sheet &quot;El Burro&quot; (The Donkey) and became later one of the principal contributors to the satirical magazine &quot;La Campana&quot; (The Bell). Later he founded the magazine &quot;La Broma&quot; (The Joke). He was also a regular contributor to serious publications such as &quot;El Mercurio&quot;, &quot;El Correo&quot;, &quot;La Patria&quot;, &quot;El Liberal&quot;, &quot;Revista del Pacífico&quot; and &quot;Revista de Sud América&quot;. He was further active as a foreign newspaper correspondent during the War of the Pacific.

Palma&#x27;s literary reputation rests upon his creation and development of the literary genre known as &quot;tradiciones&quot;, short stories that mix history and fiction, written both to amuse and educate, according to the author&#x27;s declared intention. It was by creatively using poetic license and by deviating from &quot;pure&quot; history that Palma gained his large South American readership. His &quot;Tradiciones peruanas&quot; span several centuries, with an emphasis on earlier colonial and republican times in Peru.

The &quot;Tradiciones&quot; were published from 1872 to 1910 in a series of volumes, some of which are freely available on the internet (see the bottom of this page for links). There are also many different editions and selections of the &quot;Tradiciones&quot; commercially available. The &quot;Tradiciones peruanas&quot; do not meet formal historical standards of accuracy or reliability sufficiently to be considered &quot;history,&quot; but Palma never intended them to be read as &quot;pure&quot; history. Since they are primarily historical fiction, they should be understood and enjoyed as such.

The author&#x27;s opinion, the opinions of the other primary sources or oral narrators of the stories he collects and transmits, as well as hearsay, play a large role in his stories. One of the best-known of the &quot;Tradiciones&quot;, especially within American Spanish literature classes, is &quot;La camisa de Margarita&quot;..

Some of the &quot;Tradiciones peruanas&quot; have been translated into English under the title &quot;The Knights of the Cape and Thirty-seven Other Selections from the Tradiciones Peruanas of Ricardo Palma&quot; (ed. by Harriet de Onís, 1945) and more recently under the title &quot;Peruvian Traditions&quot; (ed. by Christopher Conway and translated by Helen Lane, Oxford University Press, 2004).

The &quot;Tradiciones peruanas&quot; are recognised as a considerable contribution to Peruvian and South American literature. Some critics have classified the &quot;Tradiciones&quot; as part of nineteenth-century Romanticism.

Palma&#x27;s &quot;Tradiciones en Salsa Verde&quot; were published posthumously. These stories are similar to the &quot;Tradiciones peruanas&quot; but, because of their bawdy nature, they were not published during Palma&#x27;s lifetime for fear of shocking the sedate Lima establishment.

Throughout his life, Ricardo Palma published various articles and books on history, the results of his own historical research such as the &quot;Anales De La Inquisicion De Lima: Estudio Historico&quot; (1863) and &quot;Monteagudo y Sánchez Carrión&quot; (1877). He was a noted linguistic scholar and wrote a number of works on the subject including the &quot;Neologismos y americanismos&quot; and &quot;Papeletas lexográficas&quot;. He campaigned for recognition by the Real Academia Española of the Latin-American and Peruvian contributions to the Spanish language.

==Personal letters==

In 1999, a well-known London auction house announced the sale of a batch of 50 letters that Ricardo Palma had written to an Argentinian friend. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru persuaded the National Library of Peru on Lima to participate in the auction. It had been more than 50 years since Peru had bought cultural heritage abroad. Today these letters are kept at the National Library of Peru. Ricardo Palma University has recently published the letters of Palma in three volumes (2005–2007).

==History==

Already in the Roman period, the mining was developed in the modern Rađevina area. In the Middle Ages, mining was resurrected with the employment of the Sasi mining engineers, while the main buyers were the Ragusans. The name &#x27;Krupanj&#x27; was first recorded in Ragusan records on 27 July 1417. At the time, it was a silver mining site, frequented by Ragusan merchant caravans. Lead ore with a high content of silver was excavated at the Postenje and Jagodnja, and then transported across the Drina river, where it was melted in Srebrenica, which was a major silver processing center in the Balkans. This process also gave name to both settlements: larger lumps of ore were called &quot;krupa&quot; (hence, Krupanj) while the Serbian word for silver is &quot;srebro&quot; (Srebrenica).

According to the Ragusan papers, in the first half of the 15th century Krupanj already had a court and both the Catholic (Saint Peter and Paul) and Orthodox church (First Krupanj church in Dobri Potok). The settlement was quite developed when in 1459 fell under Ottoman rule with the rest of the Serbian Despotate. In the first wave of conquest, the Ottomans razed down the entire town, which was then rebuilt from scratch. Medieval remnants include numerous stećci with many bas-reliefs which points out to the Branković dynasty.

The Church of Dobri Potok (&quot;Dobropotočka crkva&quot;) at the town&#x27;s outskirts, which is devoted to the Holy Ascension of God-bearer Mary, was first recorded in 1528 in Turkish records, making it the oldest preserved church in the Podrinje area. Built in a traditional style, it hosts a number of records and monuments from Ottoman Rule and the &#x27;Serbian Liberation wars&#x27; period. It is surrounded by a small ethno-park with several chapels and museum rooms.

The town was first liberated in the First Serbian Uprising in 1804 by the hajduks company of Đorđe Obradović &quot;Ćurčija&quot;. Vojvoda Maksim Krstić and count Krsto Ignjatović were leaders of the defense of Krupanj during the uprising. The first basic school in the town was opened in 1837, and the church of Holy Ascension was built in 1842. The Ottomans ultimately withdrew in 1862, and the nearby fortress called &quot;Soko Grad&quot; was torn down, to be turned into the monastery of St. Nicholas.

New, intensive mining period began in 1870, and lasted up to the 1960s. Focus was shifted to antimony, while production of zinc, silver, sulfur and iron ultimately failed. At the end of the 19th century, a lead-antimony smeltery was founded in the city. During World War I, a battle between Austria-Hungary and Serbian forces was fought at the nearby site of Mačkov kamen, the peak of Jagodnja mountain. A charnel house or memorial church is built in memory of the event 1930 when the bones of both Serbian soldier and Austrian aggressors were buried in the same ossuary.

Town&#x27;s hospital was donated by the benefactor Nikola Spasić, Daily &quot;Politika&quot; donated the cultural center, in memory of its founders, brothers Darko F. Ribnikar and Vladislav F. Ribnikar, who were both killed in action in this area, fighting off Austro-Hungarian invading forces in 1914, during World War I. There are also court building, police building and hotel &quot;Borac&quot;.

During World War II, in the village of Bela Crkva, partisan Žikica Jovanović Španac killed two gendarmes on 7 July 1941, which would become the official date of celebration of the people&#x27;s uprising against occupiers in Serbia during communist rule. On 26 September 1941, a meeting of partisans&#x27; main headquarters, presided by Josip Broz Tito, was held in the nearby village of Stolice. A monument and memorial park were built after the war, celebrating the event. As the town was one of the centers of the Republic of Užice, it was burned to the ground by German occupiers in late 1941, with only a few buildings surviving.

During the war, antimony mining in Krupanj reached a peak, as German occupational forces pushed the smeltery to the maximum. Not counting the sickness, local population had no benefits from antimony production, before or after the war. Instead, they were mostly employed in agriculture, husbandry and forestry. The especially produced plums, which as prunes were exported even to the United States. Some of wood yearly would be collected from the Boranja mountain.

In the second half of the 20th century, all mining activity ceased. Founded in 1957 in Loznica, cellulose &quot;Viskoza&quot; factory became one of the largest companies in western Serbia by the 1980s. Several companies in connection to factory were founded in time in Krupanj. After the collapse of &quot;Viskoza&quot; in the 1990s, all industrial activity in Krupanj halted also. By the early 2020s, operational were only few micro-companies in wood industry, and one small textile factory, founded in the late 2010s.

Krupanj was affected by significant flooding in May 2014. Many houses, roads and a bridge were completely destroyed.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census results, the municipality has a population of 17,295 inhabitants.

==Tourism==

There are two hotels in the town center. The Church of Good Creek is a preserved building of traditional sacral architecture. Several historical monuments from the World Wars include the ones at Stolice, Mačkov kamen and Cer mountain. The monastery of Tronoša and the ethno-park in nearby Tršić preserve the memory of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, a 19th-century reformer of the Serbian language.

At the site of Mačkov kamen there is also a small ski resort. The area has some hiking and biking, and the creeks are rich in fish, especially trout; there is an organized fishing ground at the site of Zmajevac. Several sporting grounds (including a sports hall and Olympic-sized open swimming pool) offer support for sports tourism, used by sport clubs from Serbia and nearby countries.

A religious, three-part ethno-complex of Dobri Potok Church Park is built in the linden forest north of Krupanj, including the Church of the Feast of the Ascension. Forming of the complex began in 1987, though some edifices are much older, and some are in town itself. The lower, Mother of God Park includes the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God (mentioned in 1528) with belfry and vault, a museum, paintings gallery and reception venue. Close to it is the underground Church of Saint Procopius in the former mining shaft, jointly with mining, pedagogic, hunting and beekeeping exhibitions. There is also a church dedicated to the Jugović brothers and a drinking fountain. The upper, Saint Sava Park, there is another underground church, dedicated to Saint Paraskeva, and the reconstructed village household from the 19th century. The third is a recreational Park of Archdeacon Stephen. Museum &quot;Old Mansion&quot; with a restaurant is in downtown Krupanj.

<text>Verbunkos (), other spellings being &quot;Verbounko&quot;, &quot;Verbunko&quot;, &quot;Verbunkas&quot;, &quot;Werbunkos&quot;, &quot;Werbunkosch&quot;, &quot;Verbunkoche&quot;; sometimes known simply as the hongroise or ungarischer Tanz is an 18th-century Hungarian dance and music genre.

The verbunkos is typically in a pair of sections, slow (&quot;lassú&quot;), with a characteristic dotted rhythm, and fast (&quot;friss&quot;), with virtuosic running-note passages. In some cases, this slow-fast pair alternates at greater length.

The name is derived from the German word &quot;Werbung&quot;, a noun derived from the verb &quot;werben&quot; that means, in particular, &quot;to recruit&quot;; verbunkos—recruiter. This music and dance was played during military recruiting before the Habsburg emperors, who were also kings of Hungary, introduced conscription in 1849. A group of a dozen hussars performed the dance in different parts, with the leading sergeant opening with slow movements, then the lower officers joining for more energetic parts, and the youngest soldiers concluding the dance with jumps and spur-clicking.

Despite its name, the melodies originate from Hungarian folk and popular music and have been sometimes attributed to Romani people (Gypsies), because the accompaniment was usually played by Romani musicians in characteristic Romani style.

The Romani composer János Bihari (1764–1827) remains the most well-known composer and interpreter of verbunkos. Eighty-four compositions of his remain. Bihari was a violinist who played in the court in Vienna during the entire Congress of Vienna in 1814. Another composer of verbunkos was József Kossovits (d. c. 1819).

With the establishment in 1837 of the Hungarian National Theatre in Pest, the verbunkos style began to change under the influence of the first director of the theatre and operatic composer, Ferenc Erkel, whose most successful operas were Hunyadi László (1844) and Bánk bán (1861).

Haydn incorporated verbunkos into the &quot;Gypsy Rondo&quot; piano trio, composed in 1795. Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Contrasts&quot; (1938), a trio for clarinet, piano and violin, is in three movements, the first of which is named Verbunkos. His Violin Concerto No. 2 is also an example of verbunkos style.

==Slovácko verbuňk==
The Slovácko verbuňk is also an improvised folk dance in the South Moravia and Zlín districts of the Czech Republic, and was inscribed in 2008 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO.

<doc id="407284" wikidata="Q4706414" url="?curid=407284" title="Alan Coren">
<text>Alan Coren (27 June 1938 – 18 October 2007) was an English humourist, writer and satirist who was a regular panellist on the BBC radio quiz &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and a team captain on BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;. Coren was also a journalist, and for almost a decade was the editor of &quot;Punch&quot; magazine.

==Early life and education==
Alan Coren was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in East Barnet, Hertfordshire, in 1938, the son of builder and plumber Samuel Coren and his wife Martha, a hairdresser. In the introduction to &quot;Chocolate and Cuckoo Clocks: The Essential Alan Coren&quot;, Giles and Victoria Coren conclude that Samuel Coren was &quot;an odd job man really&quot; and had also apparently been a debt collector.

Coren was educated at Osidge Primary School and East Barnet Grammar School. Having gained a scholarship, he studied English at Wadham College, Oxford. He graduated from the University of Oxford with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1960: as per tradition, his BA was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree. Having won a Harkness Fellowship, he then studied for a doctorate in modern American literature at Yale University and the University of California, Berkeley. He did not complete his PhD.

==Life and career==
Coren considered an academic career but instead decided to become a writer and journalist. In his later life he distanced himself from his Jewish heritage, being &#x27;slightly embarrassed&#x27;.

He began this career by selling articles to &quot;Punch&quot; and was later offered a full-time job there. At this time he also wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

In 1963, Coren married Anne Kasriel a consultant at Moorfields Eye Hospital. The couple went on to have two children, Giles and Victoria, who both became journalists.

===Magazine editorships===
In 1966, he became &quot;Punch&quot;″s literary editor, becoming deputy editor in 1969 and editor in 1977. He remained as editor until 1987 when the circulation began to decline.

During the week in which he took over the editorship, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published a profile of him. His response was to rush around the office, waving a copy of the relevant edition, saying: &quot;This is ridiculous – I haven&#x27;t been Jewish for years!&quot;

When Coren left &quot;Punch&quot; in 1987, he became editor of &quot;The Listener&quot;, continuing in that role until 1989.

===Columns===

From 1971 to 1978, Coren wrote a television review column for &quot;The Times&quot;.

From 1972 to 1976 he wrote a humorous column for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. He also wrote for &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;.

From 1984, Coren worked as a television critic for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; until he moved as a humorous columnist to the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, which he left in 1996. In 1989, he began to contribute a column in &quot;The Times&quot;, which continued for the rest of his life.

===Broadcasting===

Coren began his broadcasting career in 1977. He was invited to be one of the regular panellists on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s new satirical quiz show, &quot;The News Quiz&quot;. He continued on &quot;The News Quiz&quot; until the year he died.

From 1996 to 2004 he was one of two team captains on the UK panel game &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;.

===Scriptwriting===

In 1978 he wrote &quot;The Losers&quot;, an unsuccessful sitcom about a wrestling promoter starring Leonard Rossiter and Alfred Molina.

===Books===

Coren published about twenty books during his life, many of which were collections of his newspaper columns, such as &quot;Golfing for Cats&quot; and &quot;The Cricklewood Diet&quot;.

From 1976 to 1983, he wrote the &quot;Arthur&quot; series of children&#x27;s books.

One of his most successful books, &quot;The Collected Bulletins of Idi Amin&quot; (a collection of his &quot;Punch&quot; articles about Amin) was rejected for publication in the United States on the grounds of racial sensitivity. These Bulletins were later made into a comedy album, &quot;The Collected Broadcasts of Idi Amin&quot; with the actor John Bird. After the Tanzanian capture of Kampala in 1979 the American journalist Art Barrett discovered a copy of Coren&#x27;s book on Idi Amin&#x27;s bedside table.

Coren&#x27;s other books include &quot;The Dog It Was That Died&quot; (1965), &quot;The Sanity Inspector&quot; (1974), &quot;All Except The Bastard&quot; (1978), &quot;The Lady from Stalingrad Mansions&quot; (1978), &quot;The Rhinestone as Big as the Ritz&quot; (1979), &quot;Tissues for Men&quot; (1981), &quot;Bumf&quot; (1984), &quot;Seems Like Old Times: a Year in the Life of Alan Coren&quot; (1989), &quot;More Like Old Times&quot; (1990), &quot;A Year in Cricklewood&quot; (1991), &quot;Toujours Cricklewood?&quot; (1993), &quot;Alan Coren&#x27;s Sunday Best&quot; (1993), &quot;A Bit on the Side&quot; (1995), &quot;Alan Coren Omnibus&quot; (1996), &quot;The Cricklewood Dome&quot; (1998), &quot;The Cricklewood Tapestry&quot; (2002) and &quot;Waiting for Jeffrey&quot; (2002). Coren&#x27;s final book, &quot;69 For One&quot;, was published late in 2007.

<doc id="407288" wikidata="Q222867" url="?curid=407288" title="2 Fast 2 Furious">
<text>2 Fast 2 Furious is a 2003 action film directed by John Singleton from a screenplay by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, based on a story by Brandt, Haas, and Gary Scott Thompson. It is the sequel to &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001) and the second installment in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise. The film stars Paul Walker as Brian O&#x27;Conner alongside Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris &quot;Ludacris&quot; Bridges, and James Remar. The plot follows ex-LAPD officer Brian O&#x27;Conner and his ex-con friend Roman Pearce, who transport a shipment of &quot;dirty money&quot; for shady Miami-based import-export dealer Carter Verone while secretly working with undercover agent Monica Fuentes to bring Verone down.

A second &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; film was planned after the box office success of its predecessor in 2001, and was confirmed with the returns of Walker and producer Neal H. Moritz. Vin Diesel and Rob Cohen, the co-star and director of the first film, were unable to return; Gibson and Singleton joined the cast in their absence in 2002. To canonically account for Diesel&#x27;s departure, the short film &quot;The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; (2003) was produced and released. Principal photography for &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; commenced in September 2002 and lasted until that December, with filming locations including Miami and the surrounding areas in southern Florida.

&quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; premiered at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles on June 3, 2003, and was released in the United States on June 6, by Universal Pictures. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and grossed $236.4 million worldwide. A sequel &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot;, was released in 2006.

==Plot==

Ex-LAPD officer Brian O&#x27;Conner has escaped to Miami and is in hiding, after aiding wanted felon Dominic Toretto in Los Angeles escape from authorities. He makes a living by street racing, driving his 1999 Nissan R34 Skyline GT-R in events organized by his friend, mechanic Tej Parker. Brian is arrested following a race, but his former boss, FBI Special Agent Bilkins and Customs Enforcement Agent Markham offers a deal to clear his record in exchange for going undercover to help arrest drug lord Carter Verone. Brian agrees on the condition he choose his partner, deciding on his estranged childhood friend Roman Pearce. Initially, Roman distrusts Brian for being a cop and not preventing his own prior arrest, but nonetheless agrees to the same record-clearing deal.

Back in Miami, Customs Agent Monica Fuentes, who is undercover working for Verone, gets them an audience. After a test in which Brian and Roman beat six other drivers to retrieve a package from Verone&#x27;s car in an impound lot, they get a job to bring a package to Verone in the Florida Keys. During the test, Markham believes they are fleeing, and nearly compromises their cover by meeting them at the lot. To prevent Markham from undermining the next job, Brian and Roman acquire a 1969 Yenko Camaro SYC and 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T in a pink slip race from two of the drivers who lost Verone&#x27;s test.

At a nightclub, Verone tortures corrupt MPD Detective Whitworth into giving the men a window to make their getaway. Verone then threatens Monica, whom he saw speaking affectionately to Brian earlier at the club. Brian and Roman revisit Tej and his crew, and they arrange a diversion during their drive to the Keys. One morning, Brian wakes up to find Monica in his house. She warns him that the drop will take place in an airfield and that Verone intends to kill them once it is complete. Enrique and Roberto arrive, looking for her, and a confrontation ensues before Verone arrives to defuse the situation, with Monica escaping beforehand.

On the day of the job, Brian and Roman split the money between their cars and leave. Whitworth eventually sends in the Miami police department, and a chase ensues. The pair lead the police to a warehouse where a scramble organized by Tej causes chaos. Brian and Roman elude the police in the muscle cars, while Tej and Suki, another street racer, are detained driving the GPS-tagged vehicles to lead the cops away. As Brian approaches the airfield, Enrique orders him to detour to a marina. At the same time, Roman ejects Roberto from his car with an improvised ejector seat using nitrous oxide. At the airfield, Customs surround the plane but realize they have been duped. At the marina, Verone reveals he was aware he was under surveillance and gave Monica false information. Verone orders Brian killed, and Monica onto his private yacht, intending to use her as leverage. Before Enrique can kill Brian, Roman arrives, and the pair incapacitate him. Verone flees aboard the yacht, but is intercepted when Brian drives the Yenko off of a ramp and crashes into the deck. Brian, Roman, and Monica incapacitate and subdue Verone.

Their deal upheld, Markham clears Brian and Roman&#x27;s record, and Roman hands over Verone&#x27;s cash. Brian and Roman agree to stay in Miami, and they decide to open a garage together, funded by a cut of the cash they secretly kept for themselves.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===
Plans to make a sequel came about after the box office success of &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;, which grossed over $200 million worldwide. John Singleton had seen the first film and was awed by it, saying: &quot;When I saw &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;, I was like, &#x27;Damn, why didn&#x27;t I think of that?&#x27; Growing up in South Central L.A., we had street races all the time.&quot; Singleton&#x27;s rave reaction of the film as well as the culture of street racing in general influenced his decision to direct the sequel. The director also claimed that the concept of street racing could be something young audiences can relate to.

The screenplay was written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, along with Gary Scott Thompson (the co-writer from the first film). There were two film treatments submitted early on, one of which did not involve Vin Diesel&#x27;s character in the event the actor would not return for the sequel. Singleton credited &quot;Top Gun&quot; as a major influence for the film, particularly with regard to the action sequences.

===Pre-production===

Vin Diesel was offered $25 million to return in the sequel as Dominic Toretto. However, he refused after reading the screenplay as he felt that its potential was inferior compared to that of its predecessor; rather, he chose to appear in &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; instead. According to &quot;Variety&quot; magazine in 2015 he was less taken with what the screenwriters had in mind for the film, &quot;They didn&#x27;t take a Francis Ford Coppola approach to it. They approached it like they did sequels in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, when they would drum up a new story unrelated for the most part, and slap the same name on it.&quot; However, Diesel reflected on his decision in a July 2014 report from Uproxx, saying: &quot;I would&#x27;ve said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t walk away from it just because the script sucked in &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; because there&#x27;s an obligation to the audience to fight, no matter what, to make that film as good as possible.&#x27; ... I might have had a little bit more patience or belief in the long-term of it.&quot;

Paul Walker, who had just finished &quot;Timeline&quot; at the time, reprised his role in the second picture as Brian O&#x27;Conner. Tyrese Gibson, then known mononymously as Tyrese, also became a part of the cast having previously acted in Singleton&#x27;s &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, which was the singer&#x27;s feature film acting debut; he portrayed Roman Pearce. Ja Rule, another prominent rap artist who appeared in &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; as Edwin, was originally tapped to reprise his role. Ja Rule was offered $500,000 for the role, which was more than what he had been paid to appear in &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;, $15,000. According to Singleton, &quot;Ja got too big for himself. He turned it down. He turned down a half a million dollars. ... He was acting like he was too big to be in the sequel. He wouldn&#x27;t return calls.&quot; Ja Rule later stated in an interview in 2021 that he was already obligated to go on tour at the time after Vin Diesel and Rob Cohen both declined to be in the movie. Ja Rule had to make the decision: to take the half a million dollars for the second Fast and Furious film or thirteen to fourteen million dollars on tour.

The character of Tej Parker was then created, at first with Redman in mind, however, when Redman also had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts with his own show Method &amp; Red, the director then hired Chris &quot;Ludacris&quot; Bridges as a substitute. Bridges would later rise to prominence for appearing in the film and star in later films such as &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;. Additional cast also included Cole Hauser as key villain Carter Verone, who appeared in Singleton&#x27;s &quot;Higher Learning&quot;; Eva Mendes as undercover agent Monica Fuentes; and Devon Aoki as Suki, the sole female driver in the film.

===Filming===
Principal photography began in the fall of 2002, and Matthew F. Leonetti served as the director of photography. Filming was done mostly in various parts of South Florida such as Miami Beach, Seven Mile Bridge, and Homestead Air Reserve Base. Hauser&#x27;s character&#x27;s mansion was shot in Coral Gables, in a house owned by Sylvester Stallone. At Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; was filmed on one side, while &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; was filmed on the other side at the same time.

A car enthusiast himself, Walker drove a Nissan Skyline GT-R model R34 borrowed from the film&#x27;s Technical Advisor, Craig Lieberman, in the film&#x27;s opening scenes. Aoki did not have a driver&#x27;s license or any driving experience prior to the film&#x27;s production, and took driving lessons during filming; she drove a pink 2001 Honda S2000 AP1 in the film. Gibson drove a convertible Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, while Michael Ealy drove a Toyota Supra Turbo MkIV model JZA80 that had been used by Walker in &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;.

===Music===

The musical score was composed by David Arnold. The soundtrack was released on May 27, 2003 on Def Jam Recordings, the same record label that Ludacris was signed to.

==Release==
&quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; premiered at the Universal Amphitheatre on June 3, 2003. The short film &quot;The Turbo Charged Prelude for 2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; was released before select screenings and on special edition home releases of the first film. It was then released to theaters in the United States on June 6, 2003.

===Home media===
&quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on September 30, 2003. It was later released on Blu-ray on March 24, 2009 and 4K Ultra-HD on October 2, 2018.

===Video game===
A mobile game was released in 2004 by Digital Bridges.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; earned $52.1 million in its U.S. opening in 3,408 theaters, ranking first for the weekend above &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. The film went on to score the fourth-highest June opening weekend, behind &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;. This was also one of three consecutive Universal films of 2003 to make an opening weekend above $50 million, with the others being &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; and &quot;Hulk&quot;. Furthermore, the film suprassed &quot;Shaft&quot; to have the highest opening weekend for a John Singleton film and &quot;XXX&quot; to have the biggest opening weekend for a Neal H. Moritz film respectively. During its second weekend, it fell behind &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, making $19.1 million. Throughout its 133 days in release, the film reached a peak release of 3,418 theaters in the U.S. and earned $127.2 million in domestically. The film had the 15th largest US gross of 2003 and the 16th largest worldwide gross of 2003; combined with the international gross of $109.2 million, the film earned $236.4 million worldwide.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; has an approval rating of 36% based on 162 reviews and an average rating of 4.80/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Beautiful people and beautiful cars in a movie that won&#x27;t tax the brain cells.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Todd McCarthy of Variety magazine wrote: &quot;While this John Singleton-directed sequel provides a breezy enough joyride, it lacks the unassuming freshness and appealing neighborhood feel of the economy-priced original.&quot;
Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote: &quot;Singleton abandons the underground racing subculture that gave the first film its allure, relying instead on lazy thriller plotting that&#x27;s only a bag of donuts and a freeze-frame away from the average TV cop show.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Mike Clark gave film 2 out of 4, and wrote &quot;The movie is all about racing, and character be damned, though the still dazed-looking Walker and Tyrese finally get a little rapport going after a worn-out story&#x27;s very rocky start.&quot; He concludes &quot;Lack of pretension helps the viewer get over the fact that this is just another retread.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 and said, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t have a brain in its head, but it&#x27;s made with skill and style and, boy, it is fast and furious.&quot; In 2018, Derek Lawrence of the &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it &quot;the forgotten Fast and Furious gem&quot; and praised the chemistry between Walker and Gibson and John Singleton&#x27;s direction. In his Vulture piece, Bilge Eberi defends &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot; as an underrated entry in Singleton’s career. Beneath its flashy exterior, the film is filled with simmering mistrust and personal grudges, turning typical action tropes into something more authentic. Eberi highlights moments of unexpected tenderness and camaraderie, like the playful joy during a car chase, showing Singleton’s unique ability to add depth even to a seemingly second-rate action flick.

In 2014, John Singleton said: &quot;It was awesome. The heads of the studio at the time were just like, just make it fun, make it cool, make it this gen.&quot; He also added, &quot;I didn’t do all that techno music that they did in the first movie. I used nothing but Southern Hip Hop which was like the rage at the time. I just funked it up, I made it more multi-ethnic.&quot; He also reflected on Paul Walker’s role: &quot;Paul [Walker] is going to be edgy. He’s going to be more like a bad boy. That was the film where he was the star.&quot; On the experience itself, Singleton said, &quot;It was a real fun experience. I got a chance to spend a year in Miami working on a multi-million dollar movie.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Sequel==

After failing to secure the returns of Diesel, Walker, or any other member of the original cast, Universal ordered a standalone sequel, &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; (2006). Moritz returned and hired director Justin Lin, who directed several subsequent installments in the series.

<doc id="407292" wikidata="Q864656" url="?curid=407292" title="Biophotonics">
<text>The term biophotonics denotes a combination of biology and photonics, with photonics being the science and technology of generation, manipulation, and detection of photons, quantum units of light. Photonics is related to electronics and photons. Photons play a central role in information technologies, such as fiber optics, the way electrons do in electronics.

Biophotonics can also be described as the &quot;development and application of optical techniques, particularly imaging, to the study of biological molecules, cells and tissue&quot;. One of the main benefits of using the optical techniques which make up biophotonics is that they preserve the integrity of the biological cells being examined.

Biophotonics has therefore become the established general term for all techniques that deal with the interaction between biological items and photons. This refers to emission, detection, absorption, reflection, modification, and creation of radiation from biomolecular, cells, tissues, organisms, and biomaterials. Areas of application are life science, medicine, agriculture, and environmental science.
Similar to the differentiation between &quot;electric&quot; and &quot;electronics,&quot; a difference can be made between applications such as therapy and surgery, which use light mainly to transfer energy, and applications such as diagnostics, which use light to excite matter and to transfer information back to the operator. In most cases, the term biophotonics refers to the latter type of application.

==Applications==

Biophotonics is an interdisciplinary field involving the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and biological materials including: tissues, cells, sub-cellular structures, and molecules in living organisms.

Recent biophotonics research has created new applications for clinical diagnostics and therapies involving fluids, cells, and tissues. These advances are allowing scientists and physicians opportunities for superior, non-invasive diagnostics for vascular and blood flow, as well as tools for better examination of skin lesions. In addition to new diagnostic tools, the advancements in biophotonics research have provided new photothermal, photodynamic, and tissue therapies.

=== Raman and FT-IR based diagnostics ===
Raman and FTIR spectroscopy can be applied in many different ways towards improved diagnostics. For example:

# Identifying bacterial and fungal infections
# Tissue tumor assessment in: skin, liver, bones, bladder etc.
# Identifying antibiotic resistances

=== Other applications ===

==== Dermatology ====
By observing the numerous and complex interactions between light and biological materials, the field of biophotonics presents a unique set of diagnostic techniques that medical practitioners can utilize. Biophotonic imaging provides the field of dermatology with the only non-invasive technique available for diagnosing skin cancers. Traditional diagnostic procedures for skin cancers involve visual assessment and biopsy, but a new laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy technique allow dermatologists to compare spectrographs of a patient&#x27;s skin with spectrographs known to correspond with malignant tissue. This provides doctors with earlier diagnosis and treatment options.

&quot;Among optical techniques, an emerging imaging technology based on laser scanning, the optical coherence tomography or OCT imaging is considered to be a useful tool to differentiate healthy from malignant skin tissue&quot;. The information is immediately accessible and eliminates the need for skin excision. This also eliminates the need for the skin samples to be processed in a lab which reduces labor costs and processing time.

Furthermore, these optical imaging technologies can be used during traditional surgical procedures to determine the boundaries of lesions to ensure that the entirety of the diseased tissue is removed. This is accomplished by exposing nanoparticles that have been dyed with a fluorescing substance to the acceptable light photons. Nanoparticles that are functionalized with fluorescent dyes and marker proteins will congregate in a chosen tissue type. When the particles are exposed to wavelengths of light that correspond to the fluorescent dye, the unhealthy tissue glows. This allows for the attending surgeon to quickly visually identify boundaries between healthy and unhealthy tissue, resulting in less time on the operating table and higher patient recovery. &quot;Using dielectrophoretic microarray devices, nanoparticles and DNA biomarkers were rapidly isolated and concentrated onto specific microscopic locations where they were easily detected by epifluorescent microscopy&quot;.

==== Optical tweezers ====
Optical tweezers (or traps) are scientific tools employed to maneuver microscopic particles such as atoms, DNA, bacteria, viruses, and other types of nanoparticles. They use the light&#x27;s momentum to exert small forces on a sample. This technique allows for the organizing and sorting of cells, the tracking of the movement of bacteria, and the changing of cell structure

====Laser micro-scalpel====
Laser micro-scalpels are a combination of fluorescence microscopy and a femtosecond laser &quot;can penetrate up to 250 micrometers into tissue and target single cells in 3-D space.&quot; The technology, which was patented by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, means that surgeons can excise diseased or damaged cells without disturbing or damaging healthy surrounding cells in delicate surgeries involving areas such as the eyes and vocal chords.

==== Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) ====
Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is an imaging technology that utilizes both laser technology and ultrasound technology. This dual imaging modality is far superior at imaging deep tissue and vascular tissues than previous imaging technologies. The improvement in resolution provides higher quality images of deep tissues and vascular systems, allowing non-invasive differentiation of cancerous tissues vs healthy tissue by observing such things as &quot;water content, oxygen saturation level, and hemoglobin concentration&quot;. Researchers have also been able to use PAM to diagnose endometriosis in rats.
==== Low level laser therapy (LLLT) ====
Although low-level laser therapy&#x27;s (LLLT) efficacy is somewhat controversial, the technology can be used to treat wounds by repairing tissue and preventing tissue death. However, more recent studies indicate that LLLT is more useful for reducing inflammation and assuaging chronic joint pain. In addition, it is believed that LLLT could possibly prove to be useful in the treatment of severe brain injury or trauma, stroke, and degenerative neurological diseases.

==== Photodynamic therapy (PT) ====
Photodynamic therapy (PT) uses photosynthesizing chemicals and oxygen to induce a cellular reaction to light. It can be used to kill cancer cells, treat acne, and reduce scarring. PT can also kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The technology provides treatment with little to no long-term side effects, is less invasive than surgery and can be repeated more often than radiation. Treatment is limited, however, to surfaces and organs that can be exposed to light, which eliminates deep tissue cancer treatments.

==== Photothermal therapy ====
Photothermal therapy most commonly uses nanoparticles made of a noble metal to convert light into heat. The nanoparticles are engineered to absorb light in the 700-1000 nm range, where the human body is optically transparent. When the particles are hit by light they heat up, disrupting or destroying the surrounding cells via hyperthermia. Because the light used does not interact with tissue directly, photothermal therapy has few long term side effects and it can be used to treat cancers deep within the body.

==FRET==
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer, also known as Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET in both cases) is the term given to the process where two excited &quot;fluorophores&quot; pass energy one to the other non-radiatively (i.e., without exchanging a photon). By carefully selecting the excitation of these fluorophores and detecting the emission, FRET has become one of the most widely used techniques in the field of biophotonics, giving scientists the chance to investigate sub-cellular environments.

==Biofluorescence==
Biofluorescence describes the absorption of ultraviolet or visible light and the sub sequential emission of photons at a lower energy level (S_1 excited state relaxes to S_0 ground state) by intrinsically fluorescent proteins or by synthetic fluorescent molecules covalently attached to a biomarker of interest. Biomarkers are molecules indicative or disease or distress and are a typically monitored systemically in a living organism, or by using an &quot;ex vivo&quot; tissue sample for microscopy, or &quot;in vitro&quot;: in the blood, urine, sweat, saliva, interstitial fluid, aqueous humor, or sputum. Stimulating light excites an electron, raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. The time delay between excitation and re-emission that occurs when returning to the stable ground state causes the photon that is re-emitted to be a different color (i.e. it relaxes to a lower energy and thus the photon emitted is at a shorter wavelength, as governed by the Plank-Einstein relationformula_1) than the excitation light that was absorbed. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescent light. This emission of light is only observable whilst the excitation light is still providing photons to the fluorescent molecule and is typically excited by blue or green light and emits purple, yellow, orange, green, cyan, or red. Biofluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light: bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.

==Bioluminescence==
Bioluminescence differs from biofluorescence in that it is the natural production of light by chemical reactions within an organism, whereas biofluorescence and biophosphorescence are the absorption and reemission of light from the natural environment.

==Biophosphorescence==
Biophosphorescence is similar to biofluorescence in its requirement of light at specified wavelengths as a provider of excitation energy. The difference here lies in the relative stability of the energized electron. Unlike with biofluorescence, here the electron retains stability in the forbidden triplet state (unpaired spins), with a longer delay in emitting light resulting in the effect that it continues to “glow-in-the-dark” even long after the stimulating light source has been removed.

==Biolasing==
A biolaser is when laser light is generated by or from within a living cell. Imaging in biophotonics often relies on laser light, and integration with biological systems is seen as a promising route to enhancing sensing and imaging techniques. Biolasers, like any lasers, require three components: a gain medium, an optical feedback structure and a pump source. For the gain medium, a variety of naturally produced fluorescent proteins can be used in different laser structure. Enclosing an optical feedback structure in a cell has been demonstrated using cell vacuoles, as well as using fully enclosed laser systems such as dye doped polymer microspheres, or semiconductor nanodisks lasers.

==Light sources==

The predominantly used light sources are beam lights. LEDs and superluminescent diodes also play an important role. Typical wavelengths used in biophotonics are between 600 nm (Visible) and 3000 nm (near IR).

===Lasers===

Lasers play an increasingly important role in biophotonics. Their unique intrinsic properties like precise wavelength selection, widest wavelength coverage, highest focusability and thus best spectral resolution, strong power densities and broad spectrum of excitation periods make them the most universal light tool for a wide spectrum of applications. As a consequence a variety of different laser technologies from a broad number of suppliers can be found in the market today.

====Gas lasers====

Major gas lasers used for biophotonics applications, and their most important wavelengths, are:

- Argon Ion laser: 457.8 nm, 476.5 nm, 488.0 nm, 496.5 nm, 501.7 nm, 514.5 nm (multi-line operation possible)

- Krypton Ion laser: 350.7 nm, 356.4 nm, 476.2 nm, 482.5 nm, 520.6 nm, 530.9 nm, 568.2 nm, 647.1 nm, 676.4 nm, 752.5 nm, 799.3 nm

- Helium–neon laser: 632.8 nm (543.5 nm, 594.1 nm, 611.9 nm)

- HeCd lasers: 325 nm, 442 nm

Other commercial gas lasers like carbon dioxide (), carbon monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen, xenon-ion, excimer or metal vapor lasers have no or only very minor importance in biophotonics.
Major advantage of gas lasers in biophotonics is their fixed wavelength, their perfect beam quality and their low linewidth/high coherence. Argon ion lasers can also operate in multi-line mode. Major disadvantage are high power consumption, generation of mechanical noise due to fan cooling and limited laser powers. Key suppliers are Coherent, CVI/Melles Griot, JDSU, Lasos, LTB and Newport/Spectra Physics.

====Diode lasers====

The most commonly integrated laser diodes, which are used for diode lasers in biophotonics are based either on GaN or GaAs semiconductor material. GaN covers a wavelength spectrum from 375 to 488 nm (commercial products at 515 have been announced recently) whereas GaAs covers a wavelength spectrum starting from 635 nm.

Most commonly used wavelengths from diode lasers in biophotonics are: 375, 405, 445, 473, 488, 515, 640, 643, 660, 675, 785 nm.

Laser Diodes are available in 4 classes:

- Single edge emitter/broad stripe/broad area

- Surface emitter/VCSEL

- Edge emitter/Ridge waveguide

- Grating stabilized (FDB, DBR, ECDL)

For biophotonic applications, the most commonly used laser diodes are edge emitting/ridge waveguide diodes, which are single transverse mode and can be optimized to an almost perfect TEM00 beam quality. Due to the small size of the resonator, digital modulation can be very fast (up to 500 MHz). Coherence length is low (typically &lt; 1 mm) and the typical linewidth is in the nm-range. Typical power levels are around 100 mW (depending on wavelength and supplier).
Key suppliers are: Coherent, Melles Griot, Omicron, Toptica, JDSU, Newport, Oxxius, Power Technology.
Grating stabilized diode lasers either have an lithographical incorporated grating (DFB, DBR) or an external grating (ECDL). As a result, the coherence length will raise into the range of several meters, whereas the linewidth will drop well below picometers (pm). Biophotonic applications, which make use of this characteristics are Raman spectroscopy (requires linewidth below cm-1) and spectroscopic gas sensing.

====Solid-state lasers====
Solid-state lasers are lasers based on solid-state gain media such as crystals or glasses doped with rare earth or transition metal ions, or semiconductor lasers. (Although semiconductor lasers are of course also solid-state devices, they are often not included in the term solid-state lasers.) Ion-doped solid-state lasers (also sometimes called doped insulator lasers) can be made in the form of bulk lasers, fiber lasers, or other types of waveguide lasers. Solid-state lasers may generate output powers between a few milliwatts and (in high-power versions) many kilowatts.

====Ultrachrome lasers====

Many advanced applications in biophotonics require individually selectable light at multiple wavelengths. As a consequence a series of new laser technologies has been introduced, which currently looks for precise wording.

The most commonly used terminology are supercontinuum lasers, which emit visible light over a wide spectrum simultaneously. This light is then filtered e.g. via acousto-optic modulators (AOM, AOTF) into 1 or up to 8 different wavelengths. Typical suppliers for this technology was NKT Photonics or Fianium. Recently NKT Photonics bought Fianium, remaining the major supplier of the supercontinuum technology on the market.

In another approach () the supercontinuum is generated in the infrared and then converted at a single selectable wavelength into the visible regime. This approach does not require AOTF&#x27;s and has a background-free spectral purity.

Since both concepts have major importance for biophotonics the umbrella term &quot;ultrachrome lasers&quot; is often used.

====Swept sources====
Swept sources are designed to continuously change (&#x27;sweep&#x27;) emitted light frequency in time. They typically continuously circle through a pre-defined range of frequencies (e.g., 800 +/- 50 nm). Swept sources in the terahertz regime have been demonstrated. A typical application of swept sources in biophotonics is optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging.

====THz sources====
Vibrational spectroscopy in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, 0.1–10 THz, is a fast emerging technique for fingerprinting biological molecules and species. For more than 20 years, theoretical studies predicted multiple resonances in absorption (or transmission) spectra of biological molecules in this range. THz radiation interacts with the low- frequency internal molecular vibrations by exciting these vibrations.

===Single photon sources===
Single photon sources are novel types of light sources distinct from coherent light sources (lasers) and thermal light sources (such as incandescent light bulbs and mercury-vapor lamps) that emit light as single particles or photons.

<text>The Fast and the Furious is a 1954 American crime drama B movie starring John Ireland and Dorothy Malone, co-directed by Ireland and Edward Sampson.

It was the first film produced for the American Releasing Corporation, and the second feature produced by Roger Corman.

==Plot==
Charged with a murder he did not commit, truck driver Frank Webster (John Ireland) has broken out of jail. While on the run toward the Mexico–United States border, and the subject of radio news reports, he is cornered in a small Southern California coffee shop by a zealous citizen who is suspicious of the stranger. Frank manages to escape and, as he gets away, kidnaps a young woman named Connie (Dorothy Malone).

Frank drives off with Connie in her Jaguar sports car; she is a &quot;lady racer&quot;. She soon proves a difficult hostage, trying to escape a few times, which leads him to treat her more roughly than they both would prefer. This mutual struggle soon leads the two to fall in love.

Frank enters into a cross-border sports car race under a pseudonym, with plans to escape into Mexico. Faber (Bruce Carlisle), one of Connie&#x27;s friends, is wary of the new stranger driving her car and tries to learn more about Frank.

To keep Connie from reporting him Frank locks her into a shed and starts the race. Connie starts a fire which is seen by a friend and is rescued. She then reports Frank to the police. Frank crashes through a road block at the border and Faber races after him. On a tight corner Faber goes off the road and crashes into a tree. Frank stops to rescue him, and Connie catches up to them in a car she has borrowed. The movie closes with them embracing as Frank has agreed to turn himself in and face a trial.

==Cast==

* John Ireland as Frank Webster
* Dorothy Malone as Connie Adair
* Bruce Carlisle as Faber
* Iris Adrian as Wilma Belding
* Marshall Bradford as Mr. Hillman
* Snub Pollard as park caretaker
==Production==
The film was based on a story by Roger Corman, who had recently moved into producing with &quot;Monster from the Ocean Floor&quot; (1954) for his company Palo Alto Productions. Corman financed &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; himself with $60,000 he received from Robert Lippert for &quot;Monster from the Ocean Floor&quot;.

According to Corman, John Ireland only appeared in the film on the condition he could direct it: &quot;John did a fine job directing on a nine-day shoot with a budget of $50,000,&quot; said Corman later. Corman also stated that Dorothy Malone &quot;had left her agent and, having no work, accepted a part for next to nothing.&quot;

The film was shot in 10 days in April 1954 under the title &quot;Crashout&quot;, but a different 1955 film would take that title.

Corman says he &quot;set up a little of the racing car business because I was interested in that, and I did some of the second unit stuff. But I didn&#x27;t direct as such.&quot;

The deal that Corman set up included having the local Jaguar dealer donate his cars as well as having scenes take place at the Monterey race track. Most of the exteriors were shot around Malibu and Point Dume, California. Corman also subbed as a driver in the second of the Jaguar XK120 race cars.

After having to operate as a second unit cinematographer and director, Corman realized he wanted to direct himself: &quot;It was after that film that I decided to become a director.&quot;

==Distribution==
After weighing offers from Columbia, Allied and Republic, Corman made a deal for &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; to be picked up for distribution by a new company, American Releasing Corporation (ARC), formed by Sam Arkoff and James H. Nicholson. Corman said &quot;I realized that the trap for an independent producer was that you made a picture but waited a long time to get your money back. So you couldn&#x27;t make many films. And what I wanted to do was to get an advance back immediately to make a series of films.&quot; Corman says he told ARC &quot;I would give them the film if they would give me all of my money back immediately as an advance against distribution and I would do the same thing on three more films, so I could set myself up as a producer. They were happy to do that because &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; enabled them to start their company. It then meant that I would be able to be a steady supplier of films for them, and they could get their company rolling.&quot;

The formation of ARC, which later became American International Pictures (AIP), was announced in October 1954, with &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; as their first release. Corman&#x27;s Palo Alto company planned to make three more features over the next twelve months, starting with &quot;Five Guns West&quot; in November.

==Reception==
===Critical===
&quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;High-priced sportscar bombs furnish most of the action&quot; saying &quot;Racing footage is interesting but becomes repetitious and helps to string out the running time to an unnecessary 73 minutes, an unhandy length for supporting playdates.&quot; Film critic Leonard Maltin dismissed the film as labored by &quot;uninspired romantic interludes and cops-on-the-chase sequences.&quot; CEA Film called the film &quot;a modest second feature.&quot;

===Box office===
The film was popular but struggled to recoup money for ARC because it often played on the bottom of double bills, which meant it received a flat fee instead of a percentage. Alex Gordon confirmed that saying &quot;it soon became obvious that single B-pictures like these first three [&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;, &quot;Five Guns West&quot;, &quot;Apache Woman&quot;] would not work out for the new company – they played the bottom of twin-bill programming at $25 per booking. AIP would have to own both pictures to obtain percentage bookings.&quot; This would prompt AIP to make movies as a package for release as a double bill.

However by August 1955 Corman claimed he had repaid his twelve main investors in the film.

==Legacy==
The film was successful enough to garner Corman a three movie deal.

Decades later, producer Neal H. Moritz and Universal Pictures licensed the film&#x27;s title for 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. Moritz said that he had difficulty choosing between proposed titles such as &quot;Racer X&quot;, &quot;Redline&quot;, &quot;Race Wars&quot;, and &quot;Street Wars&quot;, and was inspired by a documentary on AIP that included Corman&#x27;s film. Moritz was able to trade the use of some stock footage to Corman for use of the title.

Corman recalled the story differently in a 2022 interview, stating that Moritz had been struggling to name his new film and had turned to his father, a former AIP executive. His father suggested reusing the effective title of the earlier Roger Corman film. Moritz negotiated the rights to use the title from Corman.

<text>Ilminster is a market town and civil parish in the South Somerset district of Somerset, England, with a population of 5,808. Bypassed in 1988, the town now lies just east of the junction of the A303 (London to Exeter) and the A358 (Taunton to Chard and Axminster). The parish includes the hamlet of Sea.

==History==
Ilminster is mentioned in documents dating from 725 and in a Charter granted to Muchelney Abbey ( to the north) by Æthelred the Unready in 995. Ilminster is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as ‘Ileminstre’, meaning &#x27;The church on the River Isle&#x27; from the Old English ysle and mynster. By this period Ilminster was a flourishing community and was granted the right to hold a weekly market, which it still does.

Ilminster was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone.

In 1645 during the English Civil War Ilminster was the scene of a skirmish between parliamentary troops under Edward Massie and Royalist forces under Lord Goring, who fought for control of the bridges prior to the Battle of Langport.

The town contains the buildings of a sixteenth-century grammar school, the Ilminster Meeting House, which acts as the town&#x27;s art gallery and concert hall. There is also a Gospel Hall.

Canal Way in the town refers to the long abandoned and never completed Chard Canal which connected the town to the River Parrett.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Ilminster, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Ilminster Town Council and Somerset Council. The town council is based at the Old Magistrates Court on East Street in the town centre.
Ilminster was an ancient parish. When elected parish and district councils were created in 1894 it was given a parish council and included in the Chard Rural District. In 1899, Ilminster was elevated to become an urban district, removing it from the rural district. The urban district council built itself a headquarters at 4 North Street in 1935. The urban district was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the new district of South Somerset. A successor parish was created covering the former urban district, with its parish council taking the name Ilminster Town Council. The town council continued to be based at 4 North Street until 2022 when it moved to the former magistrates&#x27; court on East Street.

South Somerset was in turn abolished in 2023, with its functions passing to Somerset County Council, which re-branded itself as Somerset Council on becoming a unitary authority.

For parliamentary elections, Ilminster is part of the Yeovil constituency.

==Geography==

Ilminster is close to the River Isle and the A303 road.

===Climate===
Along with the rest of South West England, Ilminster has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures.

The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine.

Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Church==

Ilminster takes its name from the River Isle and its large church of St Mary, which is known as &quot;The Minster&quot;. The Hamstone building dates from the 15th century, but was refurbished in 1825 by William Burgess and the chancel restored in 1883. Further restoration took place in 1887-89 and 1902. Among the principal features are the Wadham tombs; those of Sir William Wadham and his mother, dated 1452 and Nicholas and Dorothy Wadham 1609 and 1618.

The tower rises two storeys above the nave. It has three bays, with a stair turret to the north-west corner. The bays are articulated by slender buttresses with crocketed finials above the castellated parapet. Each bay on both stages contains a tall two-light mullioned-and-transomed window with tracery. The lights to the top are filled with pierced stonework; those to the base are solid. The stair turret has string courses coinciding with those on the tower, and a spirelet with a weathervane. It contains a bell dating from 1732 made by Thomas Bilbie and another from 1790 made by William Bilbie of the Bilbie family. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.

==Shopping==

The town has a selection of shops including antique shops, home design, estate agents, hairdressers and several cafes and restaurants, many reminiscent of the style of earlier Edwardian and Victorian years, such as traditional Edwardian-style clothing and soft furnishings store, the Ilminster Emporium, Frame of Mind, an antiques and gifts shop and in the 15C Market Square, the Temperly store in the Phoenix Studios. A Tesco superstore is also located in the town centre.

In November the town celebrates the lighting of the Christmas lights with a Victorian evening. In earlier days celebrations were normally accompanied by the staff of local shops dressing in Victorian costume and serving rum and cakes and other refreshments ..participation by shops offering hospitality in these days is now much reduced although there is still a convivial atmosphere while visitors are enjoying their shopping.

==Culture==

Ilminster MidSummer Experience

Every year the three-day town festival, the Ilminster MidSummer Experience (IMEx), takes place on the second weekend in June. It is a community festival open free to all, organised by Experience Ilminster CIC, and includes many events and activities by local groups including the Ilminster Classic Vehicle Show, the Family Dog Show and the Ilminster Town Council Scarecrow Competition. A Food &amp; Craft Street Market takes place on the Saturday in the town&#x27;s main street together with a Suitcase Market in the Market House.

The Flag Festival forms a major part of the Ilminster Midsummer Experience. The town’s medieval road layout, which hugs closely to the 15th century Minster church, dramatically emphasises the effect of the more than 110 flags, flying from each of the town centre business premises, bringing vibrancy and colour to the town.

The Flag Festival grew out of an idea from one of the town’s artists from which a flag-maker was commissioned to work with children from Herne View Primary School (formerly Greenfylde School) to design the original 20 flags.

The &#x27;Ilminster Literary Festival&#x27;, launched in 2016, has become and established annual celebration which is usually held in early Summer.

Victorian Evening at the Christmas FestivaL..the festive Victorian Evening and switch-on of the Christmas Lights in November is part of the Ilminster Christmas Festival, organised by the Ilminster Chamber of Commerce..
The Evening includes the switching on of the Christmas Lights in Ilminster’s town centre, with shops and stalls staying open throughout the evening to offer goodwill and good cheer to all, with the staff of many shops dressed up as Victorians and offering mulled wine and eats.

The Ilminster Town Crier competition and Britain&#x27;s Disabled Strongman events also take place every year, supported by Experience Ilminster CIC, with the Town Crier Event also hosting the Wessex Championship Cup covering six counties of the west of England.

The Warehouse Theatre puts on several stage performances every year and throughout the year and the Ilminster Arts Centre provides music, art exhibitions and arts and crafts events together with a crafts shop.

Dillington House, at the entrance to Ilminster from the east, is an arts venue with accommodation managed by Somerset County Council. It dates to the sixteenth century, was the home of Prime Minister Lord North and is rated Grade 2* by English Heritage.

==Media==
Television signals are received from either the Mendip or Stockland Hill TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset on 95.5 FM, Heart West on 97.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West (formerly The Breeze) on 106.6 FM and Radio Ninesprings, a community based station which broadcast to the town on 104.6 FM.

The town is served by the local newspapers, Chard and Ilminster News, Somerset County Gazette, Somerset Guardian and Standard and Somerset Live.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===
Ilminster railway station on the Chard Branch Line closed in 1962. There were also some sidings, to allow trains going in opposite directions to pass each other. The nearest running railway station is located at Crewkerne.

=== Buses &amp; Coaches ===
There are multiple bus services that run through the town, including Buses of Somerset and an express service to London operated by Berrys Coaches.

=== Roads ===
Ilminster lies just east of the junction of the A303 (London to Exeter) and the A358 (Taunton to Chard and Axminster). The B3168 runs through the middle of the town. There have been concerns of the safety of roads in Ilminster, however schemes were announced by Somerset County Council in 2014 to make local roads safer for pedestrians and drivers.

=== Cycling ===
Ilminster is linked to Chard via the Chard to Ilminster Cycle Path. The path is part of the Wessex Way Cycle Route 

==Twinnings==
Ilminster is twinned with Riec-sur-Belon in France.

<doc id="407299" wikidata="Q22988272" url="?curid=407299" title="Hard water">
<text>Hard water is water that has a high mineral content (in contrast with &quot;soft water&quot;). Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone, chalk or gypsum, which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates, bicarbonates and sulfates.

Drinking hard water may have moderate health benefits. It can pose critical problems in industrial settings, where water hardness is monitored to avoid costly breakdowns in boilers, cooling towers, and other equipment that handles water. In domestic settings, hard water is often indicated by a lack of foam formation when soap is agitated in water, and by the formation of limescale in kettles and water heaters. Wherever water hardness is a concern, water softening is commonly used to reduce hard water&#x27;s adverse effects.

==Origins==
Natural rainwater, snow and other forms of precipitation typically have low concentrations of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. They may have small concentrations of ions such as sodium, chloride and sulfate derived from wind action over the sea. Where precipitation falls in drainage basins formed of hard, impervious and calcium-poor rocks, only very low concentrations of divalent cations are found and the water is termed &quot;soft water&quot;. Examples include Snowdonia in Wales and the Western Highlands in Scotland.

Areas with complex geology can produce varying degrees of hardness of water over short distances.

==Types==

===Permanent hardness===
The permanent hardness of water is determined by the water&#x27;s concentration of cations with charges greater than or equal to 2+. Usually, the cations have a charge of 2+, i.e., they are divalent. Common cations found in hard water include Ca2+ and Mg2+, which frequently enter water supplies by leaching from minerals within aquifers. Common calcium-containing minerals are calcite and gypsum. A common magnesium mineral is dolomite (which also contains calcium). Rainwater and distilled water are soft, because they contain few of these ions.

The following equilibrium reaction describes the dissolving and formation of calcium carbonate and calcium bicarbonate (on the right):
The reaction can go in either direction. Rain containing dissolved carbon dioxide can react with calcium carbonate and carry calcium ions away with it. The calcium carbonate may be re-deposited as calcite as the carbon dioxide is lost to the atmosphere, sometimes forming stalactites and stalagmites.

Calcium and magnesium ions can sometimes be removed by water softeners.

Permanent hardness (mineral content) is generally difficult to remove by boiling. If this occurs, it is usually caused by the presence of calcium sulfate/calcium chloride and/or magnesium sulfate/magnesium chloride in the water, which do not precipitate out as the temperature increases. Ions causing the permanent hardness of water can be removed using a water softener, or ion-exchange column.

===Temporary hardness===

Temporary hardness is caused by the presence of dissolved bicarbonate minerals (calcium bicarbonate and magnesium bicarbonate). When dissolved, these types of minerals yield calcium and magnesium cations (Ca2+, Mg2+) and carbonate and bicarbonate anions ( and ). The presence of the metal cations makes the water hard. However, unlike the permanent hardness caused by sulfate and chloride compounds, this &quot;temporary&quot; hardness can be reduced either by boiling the water or by the addition of lime (calcium hydroxide) through the process of lime softening. Boiling promotes the formation of carbonate from the bicarbonate and precipitates calcium carbonate out of solution, leaving water that is softer upon cooling.

==Effects==
With hard water, soap solutions form a white precipitate (soap scum) instead of producing lather, because the 2+ ions destroy the surfactant properties of the soap by forming a solid precipitate (the soap scum). A major component of such scum is calcium stearate, which arises from sodium stearate, the main component of soap:

Hardness can thus be defined as the soap-consuming capacity of a water sample, or the capacity of precipitation of soap as a characteristic property of water that prevents the lathering of soap. Synthetic detergents do not form such scums.
Because soft water has few calcium ions, there is no inhibition of the lathering action of soaps and no soap scum is formed in normal washing. Similarly, soft water produces no calcium deposits in water heating systems.

Hard water also forms deposits that clog plumbing. These deposits, called &quot;scale&quot;, are composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), and calcium sulfate (CaSO4). Calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside surfaces of pipes and heat exchangers. This precipitation (formation of an insoluble solid) is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration. The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes. In boilers, the deposits impair the flow of heat into water, reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat. In a pressurized system, this overheating can lead to the failure of the boiler. The damage caused by calcium carbonate deposits varies according to the crystalline form, for example, calcite or aragonite.

The presence of ions in an electrolyte, in this case, hard water, can also lead to galvanic corrosion, in which one metal will preferentially corrode when in contact with another type of metal when both are in contact with an electrolyte. The softening of hard water by ion exchange does not increase its corrosivity &quot;per se&quot;. Similarly, where lead plumbing is in use, softened water does not substantially increase plumbo-solvency.

In swimming pools, hard water is manifested by a turbid, or cloudy (milky), appearance to the water. Calcium and magnesium hydroxides are both soluble in water. The solubility of the hydroxides of the alkaline-earth metals to which calcium and magnesium belong (group 2 of the periodic table) increases moving down the column. Aqueous solutions of these metal hydroxides absorb carbon dioxide from the air, forming insoluble carbonates, and giving rise to turbidity. This often results from the pH being excessively high (pH &gt; 7.6). Hence, a common solution to the problem is, while maintaining the chlorine concentration at the proper level, to lower the pH by the addition of hydrochloric acid, the optimum value is in the range of 7.2 to 7.6.

===Softening===

In some cases it is desirable to soften hard water. Most detergents contain ingredients that counteract the effects of hard water on the surfactants. For this reason, water softening is often unnecessary. Where softening is practised, it is often recommended to soften only the water sent to domestic hot water systems to prevent or delay inefficiencies and damage due to scale formation in water heaters. A common method for water softening involves the use of ion-exchange resins, which replace ions like Ca2+ by twice the number of mono cations such as sodium or potassium ions.

Washing soda (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3) is easily obtained and has long been used as a water softener for domestic laundry, in conjunction with the usual soap or detergent.

Water that has been treated by a water softening may be termed &quot;softened water&quot;. In these cases, the water may also contain elevated levels of sodium or potassium and bicarbonate or chloride ions.

===Health considerations===
The World Health Organization says that &quot;there does not appear to be any convincing evidence that water hardness causes adverse health effects in humans&quot;. In fact, the United States National Research Council has found that hard water serves as a dietary supplement for calcium and magnesium.

Some studies have shown a weak inverse relationship between water hardness and cardiovascular disease in men, up to a level of 170 mg calcium carbonate per litre of water. The World Health Organization has reviewed the evidence and concluded the data was inadequate to recommend a level of hardness.

Recommendations have been made for the minimum and maximum levels of calcium (40–80 ppm) and magnesium (20–30 ppm) in drinking water, and a total hardness expressed as the sum of the calcium and magnesium concentrations of 2–4 mmol/L.

Other studies have shown weak correlations between cardiovascular health and water hardness.

The prevalence of atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children may be increased by hard drinking water. Living in areas with hard water may also play a part in the development of AD in early life. However, when AD is already established, using water softeners at home does not reduce the severity of the symptoms.

== Measurement ==

Hardness can be quantified by instrumental analysis. The total water hardness is the sum of the molar concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+, in mol/L or mmol/L units. Although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent divalent metal ions), iron, aluminium, and manganese are also present at elevated levels in some locations. The presence of iron characteristically confers a brownish (rust-like) colour to the calcification, instead of white (the colour of most of the other compounds).

Water hardness is often not expressed as a molar concentration, but rather in various units, such as degrees of general hardness (dGH), German degrees (°dH), parts per million (ppm, mg/L, or American degrees), grains per gallon (gpg), English degrees (°e, e, or °Clark), or French degrees (°fH, °f or °HF; lowercase &quot;f&quot; is used to prevent confusion with degrees Fahrenheit). The table below shows conversion factors between the various units.
The various alternative units represent an equivalent mass of calcium oxide (CaO) or calcium carbonate (CaCO3) that, when dissolved in a unit volume of pure water, would result in the same total molar concentration of Mg2+ and Ca2+. The different conversion factors arise from the fact that equivalent masses of calcium oxide and calcium carbonates differ and that different mass and volume units are used. The units are as follows:
* &quot;Parts per million&quot; (ppm) is usually defined as 1 mg/L CaCO3 (the definition used below). It is equivalent to mg/L without chemical compound specified, and to American degree.
* &quot;Grain per gallon&quot; (gpg) is defined as 1 grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate per U.S. gallon (3.79 litres), or 17.118 ppm.
* 1 &quot;mmol/L&quot; is equivalent to 100.09 mg/L CaCO3 or 40.08 mg/L Ca2+.
* A &quot;degree of General Hardness (dGH&quot; or &#x27;German degree&#x27; (°dH, )) is defined as 10 mg/L CaO or 17.848 ppm.
* A &quot;Clark degree&quot; (°Clark) or &quot;English degree&quot; (°e or e) is defined as one grain (64.8  mg) of CaCO3 per Imperial gallon (4.55 litres) of water, equivalent to 14.254 ppm.
* A &quot;French degree&quot; (°fH or °f) is defined as 10 mg/L CaCO3, equivalent to 10 ppm.

===Hard/soft classification===
As it is the precise mixture of minerals dissolved in the water, together with water&#x27;s pH and temperature, that determine the behaviour of the hardness, a single-number scale does not adequately describe hardness. However, the United States Geological Survey uses the following classification for hard and soft water:

Seawater is considered to be very hard due to various dissolved salts. Typically seawater&#x27;s hardness is in the area of 6,570 ppm (6.57 grams per litre). In contrast, fresh water has a hardness in the range of 15 to 375 ppm, generally around 600 mg/L.

===Indices===
Several indices are used to describe the behaviour of calcium carbonate in water, oil, or gas mixtures.

====Langelier saturation index (LSI)====
The Langelier saturation index (sometimes Langelier stability index) is a calculated number used to predict the calcium carbonate stability of water. It indicates whether the water will precipitate, dissolve, or be in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. In 1936, Wilfred Langelier developed a method for predicting the pH at which water is saturated in calcium carbonate (called pHs). The LSI is expressed as the difference between the actual system pH and the saturation pH:
* For LSI &gt; 0, water is supersaturated and tends to precipitate a scale layer of CaCO3.
* For LSI = 0, water is saturated (in equilibrium) with CaCO3. A scale layer of CaCO3 is neither precipitated nor dissolved.
* For LSI &lt; 0, water is under-saturated and tends to dissolve solid CaCO3.

If the actual pH of the water is below the calculated saturation pH, the LSI is negative and the water has a very limited scaling potential. If the actual pH exceeds pHs, the LSI is positive, and being supersaturated with CaCO3, the water tends to form scale. At increasing positive index values, the scaling potential increases.

In practice, water with an LSI between −0.5 and +0.5 will not display enhanced mineral dissolving or scale-forming properties. Water with an LSI below −0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased dissolving abilities while water with an LSI above +0.5 tends to exhibit noticeably increased scale-forming properties.

The LSI is temperature-sensitive. The LSI becomes more positive as the water temperature increases. This has particular implications in situations where well water is used. The temperature of the water when it first exits the well is often significantly lower than the temperature inside the building served by the well or at the laboratory where the LSI measurement is made. This increase in temperature can cause scaling, especially in cases such as water heaters. Conversely, systems that reduce water temperature will have less scaling.
* Water analysis:
** pH = 7.5
** TDS = 320 mg/L
** Calcium = 150 mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO3
** Alkalinity = 34 mg/L (or ppm) as CaCO3
* LSI formula:
** LSI = pH − pHs
** pHs = (9.3 + A + B) − (C + D) where:
*** A = = 0.15
*** B = −13.12 × log10(°C + 273) + 34.55 = 2.09 at 25 °C and 1.09 at 82 °C
*** C = log10[Ca2+ as CaCO3] – 0.4 = 1.78
**** (Ca2+ as CaCO3 is also called calcium hardness, and is calculated as 2.5[Ca2+])
*** D = log10[alkalinity as CaCO3] = 1.53

====Ryznar stability index (RSI)====
The Ryznar stability index (RSI) uses a database of scale thickness measurements in municipal water systems to predict the effect of water chemistry. It was developed from empirical observations of corrosion rates and film formation in steel mains.

This index is defined as:
* For 6.5 &lt; RSI &lt; 7 water is considered to be approximately at saturation equilibrium with calcium carbonate
* For RSI &gt; 8 water is undersaturated and, therefore, would tend to dissolve any existing solid CaCO3
* For RSI &lt; 6.5 water tends to be scale form

====Puckorius scaling index (PSI)====
The Puckorius scaling index (PSI) uses slightly different parameters to quantify the relationship between the saturation state of the water and the amount of limescale deposited.

====Other indices====
Other indices include the Larson-Skold Index, the Stiff-Davis Index, and the Oddo-Tomson Index.

== Regional information ==
The hardness of local water supplies depends on the source of water. Water in streams flowing over volcanic (igneous) rocks will be soft, while water from boreholes drilled into porous rock is normally very hard.

=== Australia ===
Analysis of water hardness in major Australian cities by the Australian Water Association shows a range from very soft (Melbourne) to hard (Adelaide).
Total hardness levels of calcium carbonate in ppm are:
* Canberra: 40
* Melbourne: 10–26
* Sydney: 39.4–60.1
* Perth: 29–226
* Brisbane: 100
* Adelaide: 134–148
* Hobart: 5.8–34.4
* Darwin: 31

=== Canada ===
Prairie provinces (mainly Saskatchewan and Manitoba) contain high quantities of calcium and magnesium, often as dolomite, which are readily soluble in the groundwater that contains high concentrations of trapped carbon dioxide from the last glaciation. In these parts of Canada, the total hardness in ppm of calcium carbonate equivalent frequently exceeds 200 ppm, if groundwater is the only source of potable water. The west coast, by contrast, has unusually soft water, derived mainly from mountain lakes fed by glaciers and snowmelt.

Some typical values are:
* Montreal, Quebec: 116 ppm
* Calgary, Alberta: 165 ppm
* Regina, Saskatchewan: 496 ppm
* Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: 160–180 ppm
* Winnipeg, Manitoba: 77 ppm
* Toronto, Ontario: 121 ppm
* Vancouver, British Columbia: &lt; 3 ppm
* Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island: 140–150 ppm
* Waterloo Region, Ontario: 400 ppm
* Guelph, Ontario: 460 ppm
* Saint John (West), New Brunswick: 160–200 ppm
* Ottawa, Ontario: 30 ppm

=== England and Wales ===

Information from the Drinking Water Inspectorate shows that drinking water in England is generally considered to be &#x27;very hard&#x27;, with most areas of England, particularly east of a line between the Severn and Tees estuaries, exhibiting above 200 ppm for the calcium carbonate equivalent. Water in London, for example, is mostly obtained from the River Thames and River Lea, both of which derive a significant proportion of their dry weather flow from springs in limestone and chalk aquifers. Wales, Devon, Cornwall, and parts of northwest England are softer water areas and range from 0 to 200 ppm. In the brewing industry in England and Wales, water is often deliberately hardened with gypsum in the process of Burtonisation.

Generally, water is mostly hard in urban areas of England where soft water sources are unavailable. Several cities built water supply sources in the 18th century as the Industrial Revolution and urban population burgeoned. Manchester was a notable such city in North West England and its wealthy corporation built several reservoirs at Thirlmere and Haweswater in the Lake District to the north. There is no exposure to limestone or chalk in their headwaters and consequently the water in Manchester is rated as &#x27;very soft&#x27;. Similarly, tap water in Birmingham is also soft as it is sourced from the Elan Valley Reservoirs in Wales, even though groundwater in the area is hard.

=== Ireland ===
The EPA has published a standards handbook for the interpretation of water quality in Ireland in which definitions of water hardness are given. Section 36 discusses hardness. Reference to original EU documentation is given, which sets out no limit for hardness. The handbook also gives no &quot;Recommended or Mandatory Limit Values&quot; for hardness. The handbook does indicate that above the midpoint of the ranges defined as &quot;Moderately Hard&quot;, effects are seen increasingly: &quot;The chief disadvantages of hard waters are that they neutralise the lathering power of soap[...] and, more important, that they can cause blockage of pipes and severely reduced boiler efficiency because of scale formation. These effects will increase as the hardness rises to and beyond 200 mg/L .&quot;

=== United States ===
A collection of data from the United States found that about half the water stations tested had hardness over 120 mg per litre of calcium carbonate equivalent, placing them in the categories &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;very hard&quot;. The other half were classified as soft or moderately hard. More than 85% of American homes have hard water. The softest waters occur in parts of the New England, South Atlantic–Gulf, Pacific Northwest, and Hawaii regions. Moderately hard waters are common in many of the rivers of the Tennessee, Great Lakes, and Alaska regions. Hard and very hard waters are found in some of the streams in most of the regions throughout the country. The hardest waters (greater than 1,000 ppm) are in streams in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Arizona, Utah, parts of Colorado, southern Nevada, and southern California.

<text>Ilchester is a village and civil parish, situated on the River Yeo or Ivel, north of Yeovil, in the English county of Somerset. Originally a Roman town, and later a market town, Ilchester has a rich medieval history and was a notable settlement in the county; around the 12th and 13th centuries it was effectively the county town. It had, however, declined in size and importance by the beginning of the 18th century, and the last markets were held in 1833. In 1889 the historic corporation that had governed the town (the Bailiff and Burgesses) was dissolved.

Ilchester is alternatively called Ivelchester (after the River Ivel) and the electoral ward of South Somerset District Council is named Ivelchester.

==Geography==
The parish, which includes the hamlet of Ilchester Mead, the former village of Sock Dennis or Stock-Dennis, and the old parish of Northover, has a population of 2,153. Sock Dennis lies on the Monarch&#x27;s Way long-distance footpath.

The A303 road once passed through the village but now runs via a dual carriageway bypass just to the west.

The village of Yeovilton lies to the east of Ilchester. RNAS Yeovilton continues to be a notable Royal Naval Air Station.

==History==

===Roman times===
In the Roman period, the place was named Lindinis and was the site of a fort and then a town on the Fosse Way. Finds from a large 4th-century cemetery at Northover House suggest Christian worship. It eventually served as one of two regional capitals for the Durotriges tribe.

===Medieval times===

The place-name &#x27;Ilchester&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Givelcestre&quot;. The name means &#x27;Roman fort on the River Yeo&#x27;.

There is evidence of continuous occupation of Ilchester despite the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410. Ilchester has been associated with the listed among the 28 cities of Britain by the &quot;History of the Britons&quot;, on the basis that it should be read as an Old Welsh form of &#x27;Penselwood&#x27; (&quot;coit&quot; being Welsh for &quot;forest&quot;), although others view it as three separate words: Pensa &quot;or&quot; Coyt. Bishop Ussher believed the listing referred to Exeter instead.

Around the year 1000, there was a mint at Ilchester, which was moved to South Cadbury following attacks by the Danes, and prior to the Siege of Ilchester in 1088.

The parish of Ilchester was part of the Tintinhull Hundred.

Ilchester Friary was founded between 1221 and 1260 as a Dominican monastery. The buildings were restored in the 13th and 14th centuries until the site occupied a site, and by the 15th century it extended beyond the town walls. It is believed to be the birthplace of Roger Bacon, possibly in 1213 or 1214. It was dissolved in 1538, as part of the dissolution of the monasteries, but the buildings continued to be used, as a silk mill and relief prison, particularly for Quakers, until it was finally demolished in the early 19th century.

Ilchester Nunnery was founded around 1217–1220 originally as White Hall Hospital (Latin: &quot;Alba Aula&quot;, French: &quot;Blanche Halle/Blanche Salle&quot;) and, by 1281, had been converted into an Augustinian nunnery. The original White Hall hospital had been created after the gift of a house and other property by William &quot;The Dane&quot; (Norman-French: &quot;Le Deneis&quot; etc., Latinised to &quot;Dacus&quot; {not in the least bit related to Dacia}, modernised to &quot;Dennis&quot;) of Sock Dennis. From a branch of this family was possibly descended the influential Denys family of Devon, (arms: three Danish battle axes) seated at Orleigh, near Buckland Brewer, Devon, from the 12th to 17th centuries In the early 14th century concerns were raised about the management of the nunnery and the poverty of the nuns. The building was expanded in 1370. The nunnery was dissolved in 1463 and the chapel become a free chapel, which itself was dissolved in 1548. A ruined building still existed in 1791, but the stone was then used to build the nearby Castle Farm.

Ilchester was a base for Henry III of England for a short period in 1250.

During the 12th century it was the county town of Somerset. The town has a 13th-century mace with three kings and an angel on it, which is the oldest staff of office in England. It can be seen at Ilchester Museum, which is located at the Town Hall House.

===Later times===
In July 1645 during the English Civil War, Ilchester was the scene of several skirmishes between Royalist and Parliamentary forces fighting for control of the bridges over the River Parrett and River Yeo before the Battle of Langport.

In 1795 work began on the Ivelchester and Langport Navigation, a canal linking Ilchester with Langport, but the scheme was soon bankrupted.

From 1621 to 1832, Ilchester was a Parliamentary constituency and a notorious rotten borough. Ilchester was the parliamentary seat of Sir William Manners (later Lord Huntingtower) in 1803 and 1806; however, it is said that he maintained his position by demolishing the houses of his opponents and putting them in the workhouse which meant they were not able to vote. When his son was not elected in 1818 he demolished the workhouse. He was succeeded as Member of Parliament by the Irish playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, author of &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;.

In 1962 the Ilchester Cheese Company was formed.

==Governance==
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The parish falls within the non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

The parish is in the &#x27;Ivelchester&#x27; electoral ward. Ilchester is the most populous area of the ward but this stretches south east to Mudford. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 4,319.

It is also part of the Glastonbury and Somerton county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

===Ilchester Town Trust===
Separate from the parish council, the Ilchester Town Trust repairs and manages Ilchester Town Hall, as well as providing for charitable purposes for the inhabitants of Ilchester. As well as the Town Hall, the Trust has ownership of the Roman cemetery in Northover and the Ilchester sportsfield. The Trust was established in 1889, upon the dissolution of the historic corporation that had governed the town (the Bailiff and Burgesses). The Trust also manages the Ilchester Museum which is based in the Town Hall House, behind Ilchester Town Hall.

==Religious sites==

Ilchester had at least eight churches in medieval times of which two remain. The church of St Mary Major dates from the 13th century and is a Grade II* listed building, as is the Church of St Andrew which is slightly more recent, although it may stand on the site of an earlier Roman building and associated cemetery. St Andrew&#x27;s is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

==Education==
Ilchester Community Primary School consists of a Junior school and an Infant school, which cover key stage 1 and key stage 2 of the national curriculum. Both parts of the school are separate, each having a deputy head of year. The school has 295 pupils enrolled. The school was awarded Healthy school status in the summer of 2007.
Ilchester has a few Pre-schools and a Nursery. Heron Pre-School provision was rated as good by OFSTED in 2010.
St Mary&#x27;s Pre-School, Ilchester has been in existence for around 40 years. It is located in the heart of the village, in the Church Rooms next to St Mary Major, its most recent Ofsted was in 2012 where it was rated as GOOD, particularly in safeguarding and relationships with parents.

<text>Heaviside&#x27;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii) is one of four dolphins in the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;. The small cetacean is endemic to the Benguela ecosystem along the southwest coast of Africa.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

===Nomenclature===
Early in the 19th century, a specimen was caught off the Cape of Good Hope and brought to the United Kingdom by a Captain Haviside of the British East India Company. Zoologist John Edward Gray, who described the species in his Spicilegia Zoologica, misidentified Haviside as the surgeon John Heaviside, who was known for his own biological collections at the time. &quot;Heaviside&#x27;s dolphin&quot; is the recognised common name, though amongst others, &quot;Haviside&#x27;s dolphin&quot; and &quot;Benguela dolphin&quot; are also used, the latter especially in Namibia.

The genus name &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; comes from the Greek kephale for &#x27;head&#x27; and rhynchos for &#x27;beak&#x27;. For the species name &quot;heavisidii&quot; see the above description.

===Closely related species and genetic origin===
The three other species in the genus Cephalorhynchus are the Chilean dolphin (&quot;C. eutropia&quot;), the Commerson&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;C. commersonii&quot;) and the Hector&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;C. hectori&quot;). All are located in cool temperate shelf waters in the Southern Hemisphere.

Genetic studies suggest that the &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; dolphins originated from a single common ancestor in Southern Africa, from which Heaviside&#x27;s dolphin are the basal species. Radiation around the southern hemisphere following the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (otherwise known as the West Wind Drift), first to New Zealand and then to South America, is thought to have led to the subsequent speciation within the genus.

==Description==

===Morphology===

Heaviside&#x27;s are small and stocky with adults reaching a maximum length and weight of and respectively. The dolphin has a distinct black, grey and white body pattern, and is not easily confused with any other species in its range. The head is cone shaped with a blunt beak. The dorsal fin is triangular in shape and centred in the middle of the back. The head and thorax are coloured light grey with darker patches around the eye. The dorsal fin, fluke and dorsal cape are a dark grey to almost black with a band that extends forward from the dorsal fin to the blowhole. The underbelly is white, with bands that extend onto the lower rear of the body. Small white patches are located just behind the pectoral fins and a single white patch extends between these fins on the chest. Sexual dimorphism is minimal, however variation in the shape of the white patch covering the genital slit is distinct between genders. In males, the patch ends in a point, but in females widens out to cover the mammary slits.

===Life history===
Information on reproduction is limited for Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins, however they are thought to be comparable to Hector&#x27;s and Commerson&#x27;s dolphins. Females and males reach sexual maturity approximately between 5–9 years. Mating is thought to occur year-round, however individual females may only produce calves every 2–4 years. Gestation time is unknown. Maximum known lifespan is based on the oldest recorded individual at 26 years old.

===Group size===
Typically occurs in small groups of 2–3, but numbers of 1–10 are frequent and large aggregations of ~100 individuals or more are known to form in high density areas. Nursery groups (exclusively females and calves) are not formed in this species.

===Predation===
Levels of predation are unknown; however, killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) are known predators and there is evidence of shark attack from body scars.

==Distribution==
===Geographic range===
The species is strongly associated with the cool waters of the Benguela Ecosystem. Although the southern limit of the range is defined as Cape Point, the real southern limit beyond which sightings are extremely rare is Hout Bay, some to the north (a considerable distance for a species which shows very high site fidelity to quite small spatial scales when nearshore). The species occurs more or less continuously for to the north of this along the South African coast, through Namibia and into southern Angola where the northern boundary for the species remains poorly defined. Several dolphins have been sighted or accidentally caught by fishing vessels north of the Angola–Namibia border, but no sightings were reported during a series of coastal scientific surveys at Tombua which is approximately 170 km into Angola but well south of the defined northern boundary of the Benguela Ecosystem. The northern boundary of the Benguela current shifts north and south seasonally and as Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins appear closely linked to its cool waters, their northern range limit may shift along with water conditions. Systematic surveys have dedicated effort to describing the distribution in southern South Africa and current research efforts focus on local populations in Walvis Bay and Lüderitz, Namibia. These locations are also popular hotspots for watching these dolphins in addition to Table Bay (Cape Town) and Britannia Bay, South Africa. Sightings are common from land and there are several dolphin watching tour companies by which Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins can be seen by boat.

Recent genetic research has demonstrated evidence of population structure across the range, indicating two metapopulations (north and south) with limited genetic exchange. This pattern of fragmentation is a common feature amongst the other three species in the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot; and most prevalent in the Hector&#x27;s dolphin, which displays genetic isolation over very short distances.

===Habitat preferences===
Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins typically remain nearshore in the mornings where they typically socialise and rest. When nearshore their distribution patterns are remarkably predictable within and between years, with the animals showing highly consistent use of aggregation sites at the exposed western tips of most bays throughout South Africa and Namibia, but they are rarely seen in the protected shallows of these bays. Outside of bays, they show relatively high densities along exposed sandy beaches, but these may be a secondary choice after a preference for areas where there is a high abundance of their main prey item; juvenile hake (&quot;Merluccius capensis&quot;) in adjacent offshore waters. Most commonly sighted within sea surface temperatures of and depths less than .

==Behaviour==
Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins are energetic and social animals, especially when nearshore in the mornings. Behaviour when offshore tends to be less playful and may include a rest phase when moving offshore to feed. They are attracted to boats and frequently bow-ride. Individuals can also be seen surfing in coastal waves. Iconic vertical leaps clear the water before re-entering headfirst with almost no splash. Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins use echolocation to find and capture prey. Mating typically occurs in social groups of 3–7 individuals which remain in a small area exhibiting extensive rolling, touching and position changes with frequent leaps by one of pairs of animals which potentially serve a competitive function.

===Diet and Foraging===
Prey items consist of mostly demersal fish and cephalopod species, predominantly juvenile hake (&quot;Merluccius capensis&quot;) and octopus, however pelagic species such as juvenile goby (&quot;Sufflogobius bibarbatus&quot;) and horse mackerel (&quot;Trachurus trachurus capensis&quot;) are also consumed especially in Namibia. Foraging occurs mostly at the seabed, in shallow depths. Feeding nearshore is rarely observed.

===Movement patterns===
A diurnal movement pattern is present in South Africa, whereby the dolphins move offshore in the afternoon to feed on prey rising vertically to the surface at night. Movement inshore to rest and socialise occurs in the morning. However, the pattern is different in Luderitz and Walvis Bay, Namibia where the movement is less pronounced and dolphins appear to stay inshore during the night, which is likely associated with foraging on different prey.

===Home range and site fidelity===
Heaviside&#x27;s have small home ranges of as measured using satellite telemetry over 2–3 months and photographic resightings over up to 3 years. Some individuals have been resighted at the same location for up to 10 years.

===Dive time and depth===
There has been limited research into Heaviside&#x27;s diving behaviour, however a study of two dolphins fitted with satellite tags was undertaken in South Africa in 1997. The maximum dive depth recorded was 147 meters; however, the majority of dives were less than 50 meters. Dive duration were predominantly less than 2 minutes with most dives between 0 and 1 minutes (Davis et al. 2014).

===Sympatry with other delphinids===
Whilst typically found further from shore, dusky dolphins (&quot;Lagenorhynchus obscurus&quot;) are found throughout the range and occasionally both dolphin species are sighted in mixed groups. Where both species overlap in prey selection, Heaviside&#x27;s take larger prey items, potentially because they are outcompeted by the larger dusky dolphins for their preferred, smaller sized prey. In central Namibia (especially Walvis Bay) Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins overlap with a small populations of fewer than 100 common bottlenose dolphins REF. The bottlenose dolphin population use only water less than 15m depth while in this area Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins are almost always encounteres in water deeper than , suggesting some form of competitive exclusion.

===Vocalisations===
As is the case with all species in the genus, Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins produce narrow-band high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation clicks (centred around 125–130 kHz), and do not whistle. This adaptation is theorised to allow acoustic crypsis from eavesdropping predators, as the sounds produced are outside of the detectable frequencies of killer whales. Although NBHF clicks are limited in acoustic range, they have a better resolution for small targets and are thought to provide a foraging advantage in the often cluttered, nearshore environment in which these species occur. Heaviside&#x27;s also produce a second click type, of lower frequency and broader bandwidth, that is within the hearing range of killer whales. These calls are produced most frequently in groups engaging in social behaviour. It is likely that the dolphins use these calls when socialising away from predator threat and switch to high frequency clicks when foraging and travelling.

==Population status==
No total abundance estimate currently exists, however a population estimate of 6,345 for the region between Table Bay and Lamberts Bay, South Africa represents the southernmost populations in the species range. Local population estimates for Walvis bay and Lüderitz are 508 and 494 respectively. A visual and acoustic line-transect ship survey estimated an average of 1594 dolphins in the Namibian Islands&#x27; Marine Protected Area (NIMPA), which spans of coastline along southern Namibia (REF Martin et al. 2020). Quantification of abundance throughout the range is still required.

==Threats==
Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins are exposed to a variety of threats given their limited range in coastal shallow waters which are subject to a range of anthropogenic activities. Directed catch has occurred historically, with meat being used for human consumption.

===Bycatch and hunting===
Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins are exposed to several poorly quantified and rapidly changing human threats including fisheries bycatch related mortality and illegal directed catch (Elwen and Gopal, 2018; Alfaro-Shigueto et al., 2019). Recently developed mid water trawls for horse mackerel (specifically &quot;Trachurus capensis&quot;) are considered an emerging threat.

===Climate change===
Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins are listed amongst the cetacean species most vulnerable to climate change as they are limited to a distribution range that includes both suitable shelf habitat and cool water temperatures (Best, 2007). The Benguela Current is the only eastern-boundary current bordered by warm-water currents at both its northern and southern limits. Consequently, small increases in water temperature could result in all shelf waters in this area becoming too warm for both species, and populations are expected to decline rather than shift poleward due to a lack of shelf habitat.

===Boat interactions===
Heaviside&#x27;s dolphins may be exposed to increase in the marine eco-tourism business in Namibia, which has grown without regulation in Walvis Bay (Leeney, 2014). Negative effects have been demonstrated for other coastal cetacean species, for example the impact of tour boats on bottlenose dolphin behaviour in Walvis Bay includes a reduction in resting behaviour and an increase in socialising behaviour in the presence of tour boats (indurkyhua). One Heaviside&#x27;s dolphin was documented in 2010 with evidence of a propeller strike along its flank. As individuals have small home ranges, they may be vulnerable to localised threats.

==Conservation status==
Prior to 2018, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the Heaviside&#x27;s as &#x27;Data Deficient&#x27; however, as of 2017 the status was changed to &#x27;Near Threatened&#x27;, owing to improved knowledge on the species from multiple studies. Despite this, the overall population trend remains unknown, and there are many aspects of the species biology that remain to be studied.

Heaviside&#x27;s dolphin is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals and is included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia. The Memorandum of Understanding was established in 2008 and aims to protect these species at a national, regional and global level.

<doc id="407310" wikidata="Q206715" url="?curid=407310" title="Second Intermediate Period of Egypt">
<text>The Second Intermediate Period dates from 1700 to 1550 BC. It marks a period when ancient Egypt was divided into smaller dynasties for a second time, between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom. The concept of a Second Intermediate Period generally includes the 13th through to the 17th dynasties, however there is no universal agreement in Egyptology about how to define the period. 

It is best known as the period when the Hyksos people of West Asia established the 15th Dynasty and ruled from Avaris, which, according to Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, was founded by a king by the name of Salitis. The settling of these people may have occurred peacefully, although later recounts of Manetho portray the Hyksos &quot;as violent conquerors and oppressors of Egypt&quot;. 

The Turin King List from the time of Ramesses II remains the primary source for understanding the chronology and political history of the Second Intermediate Period, along with studying the typology of scarabs, beetle-shaped amulets mass-produced in ancient Egypt and often inscribed with the names of rulers. 

== Collapse of the Middle Kingdom ==
The 12th Dynasty of Egypt ended in the late 19th century BC with the death of Queen Sobekneferu. She had no heirs, causing the dynasty to come to an abrupt end, and with it, the most prosperous era of the Middle Kingdom; it was succeeded by the much weaker 13th Dynasty. According to the Byzantine chronicler George Syncellus, all three sources of the translated king list of Africanus, Eusebius, and the Armenian of Eusebius state that the 13th Dynasty had sixty kings that ruled and lived in Dioplus for roughly 453 years. Retaining the seat of the 12th Dynasty, the 13th Dynasty (c. 1773 – 1650 BC) ruled from Itjtawy (&quot;Seizer-of-the-Two-Lands&quot;) for most of its existence.

=== Migration to Thebes ===
The 13th Dynasty switched to Thebes in the far south possibly in the reign of Merneferre Ay. Daphna Ben Tor believes that this event was triggered by the invasion of the eastern Delta and the Memphite region by Canaanite rulers, who had their own culture, a variant of the contemporary late Palestinian Middle Bronze Age culture of the southern Levant. For some authors, this marks the end of the Middle Kingdom and the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period. This analysis is rejected by Ryholt and Baker however, who note that the stele of Seheqenre Sankhptahi, reigning toward the end of the dynasty, strongly suggests that he reigned over Memphis. The stele is of unknown provenance.

Though the 13th Dynasty may have controlled Upper Egypt, the 14th Dynasty ruled Lower Egypt, and both houses agreed to co-exist allowing trade. Evidently the rulers had trouble with securing power within their territory, being replaced in rapid fashion, but other factors like famine may have played a part. The eventual collapse of the 13th Dynasty became an opening for two smaller dynasties to take control of Egypt.

== Transitional period ==
Similar to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt, the Second Intermediate Period was dynamic time in which rule of Egypt was roughly divided between rival power bases in Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, each controlling a portion of land.

=== 14th Dynasty ===
The 13th Dynasty proved unable to hold on to the entire territory of Egypt, and a provincial ruling family, located in the Nile Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the 14th Dynasty (–1650 BC). According to Syncellus, all three sources agree that the 14th Dynasty had seventy-six kings and their court was located in Xois, now modern day Sakha, although they provide different numbers of years ruled. Africanus stated the dynasty reigned for 184 years, while the Armenian version of Eusebius states 484 years. Eusebius states the same as Africanus, but in another copy the same number as the Armenian version. 

The precise borders of the 14th Dynasty state are not known, due to the general scarcity of its monuments. In his study of the Second Intermediate Period, Kim Ryholt concludes that the territory directly controlled by the 14th Dynasty roughly consisted of the Nile Delta, with borders located near Athribis in the western Delta and Bubastis in the east. Most modern Egyptologists share the view that Avaris – rather than Xois – was the 14th Dynasty&#x27;s seat of power. 

Contested rulers proposed by Ryholt as the first five rulers of the dynasty are commonly identified as being of Canaanite (Semitic) descent based on their names. His conclusions about their chronological position within the period are contested in Ben Tor&#x27;s study. Other sources don&#x27;t refer to the dynasty as foreign or Hyksos and they were not referred to as &quot;rulers of foreign lands&quot; or &quot;shepherd kings&quot; in kings lists.

The contested rulers (with the translation of their nomens) are: 

* Yakbim Sekhaenre (&quot;Yakbim&quot; means &quot;(the goddess) Aya is a rock&quot;)
* Ya&#x27;ammu Nubwoserre (&quot;Ya&#x27;ammu&quot; means &quot;where is the uncle?&quot;)
* Qareh Khawoserre (&quot;Qareh&quot; means &quot;the bald one&quot;)
* &#x27;Ammu Aahotepre (&quot;&#x27;Ammu&quot; could mean &quot;the Asiatic&quot;) 
* Sheshi Maaibre (&quot;Sheshi&quot; is a Semitic name)

The most attested, non-contested ruler of the dynasty, Nehesy Aasehre, left his name on two monuments at Avaris. His name means &quot;the Nubian&quot;. According to Ryholt, he was the son and direct successor of the pharaoh Sheshi with a Nubian Queen named Tati. 

The 14th Dynasty saw great success during their early years, but like the late 13th Dynasty, the rulers were replaced in rapid succession. The 14th Dynasty was overthrown by the Hyksos.

=== 15th Dynasty ===
The Hyksos established their own dynasty in Egypt, the 15th Dynasty (c.1650 to 1550 BC). The first king of the 15th Dynasty, Salitis, described as a Hyksos (&quot;ḥḳꜣw-ḫꜣswt&quot;, a &quot;shepherd&quot; according to Africanus), led his people into an occupation of the Nile Delta area and settled his capital at Avaris. According to Manetho, Salitis is believed to have conquered the entirety of Egypt, however it is more likely that his rule did not extend beyond Lower Egypt. Salitis may be equated to a poorly known king named Sharek, and possibly even Sheshi, the most attested ruler of the Second Intermediate Period. The Turin King list indicates that there were six Hyksos kings, with an obscure Khamudi listed as the final king of the 15th Dynasty.

The 15th Dynasty of Egypt ruled from Avaris but did not control the entire land, leaving some of northern Upper Egypt under the control of both the Abydos Dynasty and the early 16th Dynasty. The 16th Dynasty was ruled not by the Hyksos themselves, but the Thebans.

It is debated if the movement of the Hyksos was a military invasion or a mass migration of Asiatics from Palestine. The settling of Canaanite populations may have occurred peacefully in the wake of the disintegration of the 14th Dynasty. A recent Strontium isotope analysis also dismissed the invasion model in favor of a migration one. Contrary to the model of a foreign invasion, the study didn&#x27;t find more males moving into the region, but instead found a sex bias towards females, with a high proportion (77%) being non-locals.

=== Abydos Dynasty ===

The Abydos Dynasty (c. 1640 to 1620 BC.) may have been a short-lived local dynasty ruling over part of Upper Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period in Ancient Egypt and was contemporary with the 15th and 16th dynasties. The Abydos Dynasty stayed rather small with rulership over just Abydos or Thinis. Very little is known about the Abydos dynasty, since it was very short-lived, though we do have some king names that appear in Turin king list, but not in any other sources. 

The dynasty tentatively includes four rulers: Wepwawetemsaf, Pantjeny, Snaaib, and Senebkay. The Abydos Dynasty ceased when the Hyksos expanded into Upper Egypt.

=== 16th Dynasty ===
The 16th Dynasty (c. 1650-1580 BC) ruled the Theban region in Upper Egypt. Of the two chief versions of Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, the 16th Dynasty is described by the more reliable Africanus (supported by Syncellus) as &quot;shepherd [&quot;Hyksos&quot;] kings&quot;, but by Eusebius as Theban. 

The continuing war against the 15th Dynasty dominated the short-lived 16th Dynasty. The armies of the 15th Dynasty, winning town after town from their southern enemies, continually encroached on 16th Dynasty territory, eventually threatening and then conquering Thebes itself. Famine, which had plagued Upper Egypt during the late 13th Dynasty and the 14th Dynasty, also blighted the 16th Dynasty, most evidently during and after the reign of Neferhotep III. 

The end of the 16th Dynasty came after relentless military pressure by the succeeding 15th Dynasty after many attempts, with evidence of Nebiryraw I&#x27;s own personal seals being found in the Hyksos territory. Sometime around 1580 BC, the 16th Dynasty collapsed after being conquered by King Khyan of the Hyksos 15th Dynasty.

=== 17th Dynasty ===
The 17th Dynasty (c.1571-1540 BC) was established by the Thebans quickly after the fall of the 16th. The details of the overthrow of the Hyksos in Thebes are unclear. Sources such as Africanus and Eusebius indicate that the 16th Dynasty comprised shepherd kings (like the 15th Dynasty), but also Theban kings too. 

The 17th Dynasty would also see four different ruling families whose last king did not have a male heir to the throne. Subsequently, other powerful families established kings having short reigns. The 17th Dynasty maintained a short-lived peace with the 15th Dynasty, which ended with the start of the reign of Seqenenre (c. 1549-1545 BC), who started a series of wars against the Hyksos. King Kamose (c. 1545-1540 BC) continued the war against the Hyksos as a whole, but his brother Ahmose I would be the king to deal the final blow; he thus became the first king of the New Kingdom 18th Dynasty. 

=== Reunification ===
At the end of the Second Intermediate period, the 18th Dynasty came to power in Egypt. The first king of the 18th Dynasty, Ahmose, completed the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt and consolidated his rule over the land, unifying Upper and Lower Egypt. With that, Ahmose ushered in a new period of prosperity, the New Kingdom.

<text>Kontakto is an Esperanto magazine published by TEJO and supported by the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA). Its 6 annual issues have readers in about 100 countries of the world. It started in 1963 through a proposal of the UEA committee by Humphrey Tonkin, who became its first editor in chief and who provided a magazine that touched on topics of interest to Esperanto youth. The magazine often used the slogan &quot;In Esperanto, but not about Esperanto.&quot;

In the early 1980s, Anna Lowenstein became the editor. Her contributions to the magazine included easy-to-read articles, which concerned serious topics, but were written in simple language suitable for beginning Esperanto learners. This continues to be a primary focus for the magazine.

<text>Francis James Baird Wheen (born 22 January 1957) is a British journalist, writer and broadcaster.

==Early life and education==
Wheen was born into an army family and educated at two independent schools: Copthorne Preparatory School near Crawley, West Sussex, and Harrow School in north-west London. At Harrow, he was briefly a contemporary of Mark Thatcher, who has been a subject of his journalism.

==Career==

Running away from Harrow at 16 &quot;to join the alternative society,&quot; Wheen had early periods as a &quot;dogsbody&quot; at &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, before attending Royal Holloway College, University of London, following a period spent at a crammer. 

Wheen is the author of several books, including a biography of Karl Marx which won the Deutscher Memorial Prize in 1999, and has been translated into twenty languages. He followed this with a notional &quot;biography&quot; of &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, which follows the creation and publication of the first volume of Marx&#x27;s major work as well as other incomplete volumes. Wheen had a column in &quot;The Guardian&quot; for several years. He wrote for &quot;Private Eye&quot; and became the magazine&#x27;s deputy editor. He retired from &quot;Private Eye&quot; in October 2022, though he still occasionally contributes.

His collected journalism, &quot;Hoo-hahs and Passing Frenzies&quot;, won him the Orwell Prize in 2003. He has also been a regular columnist for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

In April 2012, Wheen suffered the loss of his entire book collection, his &quot;life&#x27;s work&quot;, and an unfinished novel, in a garden shed fire.

===Broadcasting work===
Wheen broadcasts regularly, mainly on BBC Radio 4, has made many appearances on &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, in which he has often referred to the fact that he resembles the former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith. He has also several times been a guest on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

Wheen wrote a docudrama, &quot;The Lavender List&quot;, for BBC Four on the final period of Harold Wilson&#x27;s premiership, concentrating on his relationship with Marcia Williams. First screened in March 2006, it starred Kenneth Cranham as Wilson and Gina McKee as Williams. In April 2007, the BBC paid £75,000 to Williams (then Baroness Falkender) in an out-of-court settlement over claims made in the programme.

==Political views==
Wheen was opposed to the Falklands War. In an article syndicated to a number of American newspapers, Wheen stated: &quot;In a famous British play of the 1950s, &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, the hero complained that &#x27;there aren&#x27;t any good, brave causes to fight for anymore&#x27;. Mrs Thatcher apparently agrees with this view, so she went to war over a small, ignoble cause.&quot; Wheen is a supporter of the anti-monarchist group Republic.

Wheen supported NATO&#x27;s Kosovo intervention in 1999, signed the Euston Manifesto for a realignment of progressive politics and supported the second Iraq War.

In late 2005, Wheen was the co-author with David Aaronovitch and blogger Oliver Kamm, both contributors to &quot;The Times&quot;, of a complaint to &quot;The Guardian&quot; after it published an apology and correction in respect of an interview with Noam Chomsky by Emma Brockes which had been published at the end of October 2005; Chomsky had complained that the interview was defamatory in suggesting that he denied the 1995 Srebrenica massacre by his defence of a book by Diana Johnstone.

Wheen was intensely critical of Foreign Office minister Baroness Anelay&#x27;s failure to condemn the torture of Raif Badawi by the government of Saudi Arabia in 2016. Wheen maintained that Anelay&#x27;s approach was motivated by her wish to sell arms to the Saudi régime.

==Personal life==
Wheen was married to the writer Joan Smith between 1985 and 1993. He has been the partner since the mid-1990s of Julia Jones (formerly Julia Thorogood), whom he married in 2019; they have two sons.

In 2014, Wheen waived his right to anonymity in order to speak about being a victim of Charles Napier, one-time treasurer of the defunct Paedophile Information Exchange, after the former teacher was convicted of sexually abusing 23 boys between 1967 and 1983. Wheen described his experience as less serious than that of other victims, and had only become aware of the scale of Napier&#x27;s activities later.

Wheen was a close friend of the writer Christopher Hitchens.

<text>The Democratic Party of Ivory Coast – African Democratic Rally (; abbreviated PDCI-RDA) is a centre-right political party in Ivory Coast.

==History==
Founded during the colonial era in 1946, as an outgrowth of the African Agricultural Union, and initially affiliated with the French Communist Party, it became the only legal party in the country upon independence in 1960. For the next 30 years, the PDCI and the government were effectively one. Every five years, its founder and leader, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, was automatically elected to a five-year term as president of the republic and confirmed in office via a referendum. At the same time, a single list of PDCI candidates was returned to the National Assembly.

All adult Ivorians were required to be members of the party, which was considered the primary intermediary between the government and the people. Even after opposition parties were legalised in 1990, the PDCI continued to dominate Ivorian politics. At the 1990 elections, Houphouët-Boigny was reelected with an implausible 81 percent of the vote, and the party won all but 12 seats in the legislature.

Houphouët-Boigny led the party from its formation until his death in 1993. A year later, acting president of the republic Henri Konan Bédié became the party&#x27;s second leader. He served out Houphouët-Boigny&#x27;s seventh term, and was elected in his own right in 1995 with over 96 percent of the vote; the opposition parties had boycotted the election in protest of new eligibility requirements that they deemed unfair. The party lost power when Bédié was ousted in a December 1999 coup.

The PDCI announced in early 2000 that it would hold a congress to choose new leadership, and Bédié denounced this as a &quot;putsch&quot;; the party decided to retain Bédié in the leadership, however. In August, Bédié and four other PDCI members registered as candidates in the October 2000 presidential election; shortly afterward, Emile Constant Bombet, who had served as Interior Minister under Bédié, defeated Bédié for the PDCI presidential nomination. Bombet and Bédié were both barred from running by the Constitutional Court in early October, and on October 10 Bédié called for a boycott of the election.

Unlike many former single parties in Africa, the PDCI has made a good account of itself since losing power. In the parliamentary election held on 10 December 2000 and 14 January 2001, the party won 94 out of 225 seats.

On 18 May 2005, the PDCI and the Rally of the Republicans (RDR), despite a history of hostility towards one another (the RDR had been formed as a liberal splinter from the PDCI in 1994), signed an agreement to form a coalition, the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace, along with two smaller parties, the Union for Democracy and Peace in Ivory Coast (UDPCI) and the Movement of the Forces of the Future (MFA), ahead of the presidential election then planned for October 2005. This election was delayed several times, finally held in 2010. By that time, the two parties had resumed competing against each other.

At the 11 December 2011 parliamentary election, the PDCI remained the principal opposition party, with 76 seats.

At the 2016 parliamentary election, the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace (composed of the RDR, the PDCI and some minor parties) won a strong majority at the National Assembly.

At the 2021 Ivorian parliamentary election, the PDCI only gained around 6% of the vote and 23 seats. The Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace won, in contrast, 49% of the vote and now have 137 seats in the parliament.

<doc id="407323" wikidata="Q1762536" url="?curid=407323" title="Gabonese Democratic Party">
<text>The Gabonese Democratic Party (, PDG) is a political party in Gabon. It was the dominant political party in Gabonese politics from 1961 until 2023, when it was deposed in a coup d&#x27;état against President Ali Bongo. It was also the sole legal party between 1968 and 1990.

==History==
The party was established as the Gabonese Democratic Bloc (, BDG) in 1953 as a merger of the Gabonese Mixed Committee and the Gabonese Democratic Party. In the 1957 Territorial Assembly elections it won eight seats, finishing behind the Gabonese Democratic and Social Union (UDSG), which had won 14 seats. However, the BDG was able to form a coalition government with the &quot;Entente–Defence of Gabonese Interests&quot; list, headed by one of its members, and five independents.

The BDG and UDSG formed an alliance prior to the 1961 general elections, with BDG leader Léon M&#x27;ba as the sole presidential candidate, and a joint &quot;National Union&quot; list running unopposed for the National Assembly. The 1964 parliamentary elections saw the two parties run against each other, with the BDG winning 31 of the 47 seats.

The BDG was the only party to contest the 1967 general elections, with M&#x27;ba re-elected as President. M&#x27;ba died later in the year and was succeeded by Omar Bongo. On 12 March 1968 the BDG was succeeded by the Gabonese Democratic Party, which became the sole legal party. The PDG and Bongo were re-elected in one-party elections in 1973, 1980 and 1985, before constitutional amendments in May 1990 re-established the multi-party system.

The PDG retained power in the 1990 parliamentary elections, winning 63 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly. Bongo was re-elected again in 1993 with 51% of the vote. The party won 85 seats in the 1996 parliamentary elections, and Bongo was re-elected for a fifth time in 1998, with 67% of the vote. The PDG gained one seat in the 2001 parliamentary elections and Bongo was re-elected again in 2005 with 79% of the vote.

The 2006 parliamentary elections saw the PDG reduced to 82 seats, although it comfortably retained its majority and affiliated parties won a further 17 seats. Bongo died in 2009, and his son Ali Bongo became PDG leader. He won presidential elections later in the year with 42% of the vote. The BDG won 113 seats in the 2011 parliamentary elections, which were boycotted by most of the opposition.

==Congresses==

On 17–21 September 1986, the PDG held its Third Ordinary Congress in Libreville; at the congress, it designated Bongo as its candidate for the single-party November 1986 presidential election.

From 1991 to 1994, the Secretary-General of the PDG was Jacques Adiahénot.

The PDG held its Ninth Ordinary Congress on 19–21 September 2008. At this congress, Faustin Boukoubi, who had been Minister of Agriculture, was elected as the party&#x27;s Secretary-General; he replaced Simplice Guedet Manzela, who had previously been the Secretary-General for ten years. Also at the congress, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, composed of 18 members, was elected. The Standing Committee included two members from each of Gabon&#x27;s nine provinces, and 15 of its 18 members were also members of the government.

PDG has several branches (or &#x27;Federations&#x27;) abroad, with the largest being in France and in the United States.

<text>Video game modding (short for &quot;modifying&quot;) is the process of alteration by players or fans of one or more aspects of a video game, such as how it looks or behaves, and is a sub-discipline of general &quot;modding&quot;. A set of modifications, commonly called a mod, may range from small changes and tweaks to complete overhauls, and can extend the replay value and interest of the game.

Modding a game can also be understood as the act of seeking and installing mods to the player&#x27;s game, but the act of tweaking pre-existing settings and preferences is not truly modding.

Mods have arguably become an increasingly important factor in the commercial success of some games, as they add depth to the original work, and can be both fun for players playing the mods and as a means of self-expression for mod developers.

People can become fans of specific mods, in addition to fans of the game they are for, such as requesting features and alterations for these mods. In cases where mods are very popular, players might have to clarify that they are referring to the unmodified game when talking about playing a game. The term &quot;vanilla&quot; is often used to make this distinction. &quot;Vanilla &quot;Minecraft&quot;&quot;, for example, refers to the original, unmodified game.

As early as the 1980s, video game mods have also been used for the sole purpose of creating art, as opposed to an actual game. This can include recording in-game actions as a film, as well as attempting to reproduce real-life areas inside a game with no regard for game play value. This has led to the rise of artistic video game modification, as well as machinima and the demoscene.

Popular games can have tens of thousands of mods created for them.

==Development==

Many mods are not publicly released to the gaming community by their creators. Some are very limited and just include some gameplay changes or even a different loading screen, while others are total conversions and can modify content and gameplay extensively. A few mods become very popular and convert themselves into distinct games, with the rights getting bought and turning into an official modification, or in some cases a stand-alone title that does not require the original game to play.

Technical and social skills are needed to create a mod. A group of mod developers may join to form a &quot;mod team&quot;.

&quot;Doom&quot; (1993) was the first game to have a large modding community. In exchange for the technical foundation to mod, id Software insisted that mods should only work with the retail version of the game (not the demo), which was respected by the modders and boosted &quot;Doom&quot;″s sales. Another factor in the popularity of modding &quot;Doom&quot; was the increasing popularity of the Internet, which allowed modding communities to form. Mods for &quot;Quake&quot; (1996) such as &quot;Capture the Flag&quot; and &quot;Team Fortress&quot; became standard features in later games in the shooter genre. While first-person shooters are popular games to mod, the virtual pet genre with games such as &quot;Petz&quot; (1995) and &quot;Creatures&quot; (1996) fostered younger modders, particularly girls.

A recurring trend with video game mods is the creation of user-made skins and/or character models replacing the default ones that came with the game, the most popular of which are meme mods such as those of Carl Johnson from &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; and Thomas the Tank Engine, though at least one modder received legal action from &quot;Thomas&quot; franchise rights owner Mattel for their unauthorised use of the &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot; intellectual property in a &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; mod.

===Tools===
Mod-making tools are a variety of construction sets for creating mods for a game. Early commercial mod-making tools were the &quot;Boulder Dash Construction Kit&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale Construction Set&quot; (1991), which allowed users to create game designs in those series. Much more successful among early mod-making tools was the 1992 &quot;Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures&quot; from Strategic Simulations, Inc., which allowed users to construct games based on the game world that was launched with the &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; game.

By the mid-1990s, modding tools were commonly offered with PC games, and by the early 2000s, a game that launched with no modding tools was considered more worthy of note in a review than one that did. Maxis released the modding tools for &quot;The Sims&quot; (2000) before the game itself, resulting in a suite of fan-created mods being available at launch. The advertising campaign for &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; (2002) focused on the included Aurora toolset. The &quot;World Editor&quot; for &quot;Warcraft III&quot; (2002) allowed a variety of custom scenarios or maps to be created for the game, such as a number of tower defense and multiplayer online battle arena maps, the most notable of which was &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot;. The provision of tools is still seen as the most practical way that a company can signal to fans that its game is open for modding. Fans may also use and create open-source software tools for modding games. Generative AI is expected to make developing for hobby projects easier, particularly with assets such as textures and voice acting (which traditionally requires hiring capable voice actors, thereby presenting a barrier to entry for amateur mod teams), though this also led to ethical issues over its use especially with voice actors who expressed concern regarding their characters&#x27; voices being cloned without their consent.

There are also free content delivery tools available that make playing mods easier. They help manage downloads, updates, and mod installation in order to allow people who are less technically literate to play. Steam&#x27;s &quot;Workshop&quot; service, for example, allows a user to easily download and install mods in supported games.

===Game support for modifications===

The potential for end-user change in game varies greatly, though it can have little correlation with the number and quality of mods made for a game.

In general the most modification-friendly games will define gameplay variables in text or other non proprietary format files (for instance in the &quot;Civilization&quot; series one could alter the movement rate along roads and many other factors), and have graphics of a standard format such as bitmaps. Publishers can also determine mod-friendliness in the way important source files are available, such as &quot;Doom&quot; having its art assets separate from the main program, which allows them to be shared and modified.

Games have varying support from their publishers for modifications, but often require expensive professional software to make. One such example is &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; (2003), which requires the program Maya to build new in-game objects. However, there are free versions of Maya and other advanced modeling software available. There are also free and even open-source modeling programs (such as Blender) that can be used as well.

For advanced mods such as &quot;Desert Combat&quot; that are total conversions, complicated modeling and texturing software are required to make original content. Advanced mods can rival the complexity and work of making the original game content (short of the engine itself), rendering the differences in ease of modding small in comparison to the total amount of work required. Having an engine that is for example easy to import models to, is of little help when doing research, modeling, and making a photorealistic texture for a game item. As a result, other game characteristics such as its popularity and capabilities have a dominating effect on the number of mods created for the game by users.

A game that allows modding is said to be &quot;moddable&quot;. &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; (2011) as well as its predecessors, &quot;Morrowind&quot; (2002) and &quot;Oblivion&quot; (2006), are examples of highly moddable games, with an official editor available for download from the developer. &quot;Daggerfall&quot; (1996) was much less moddable, but some people released their own modifications nevertheless. Some modifications such as &quot;Gunslingers Academy&quot; have deliberately made the game more moddable by adding in scripting support or externalizing underlying code. &quot;Supreme Commander&quot; (2007) set out to be the &#x27;most customisable game ever&#x27; and as such included a mod manager which allowed for modular modding, having several mods on at once.

The game industry is currently facing the question of how much it should embrace the players&#x27; contribution in creating new material for the game or mod-communities as part of their structure within the game. Some software companies openly accept and even encourage such communities. Others though have chosen to enclose their games in heavily policed copyright or Intellectual Property regimes (IPR) and close down sites that they see as infringing their ownership of a game.

===Portability issues===

For cross-platform games, mods written for the Windows version have not always been compatible with the Mac OS X and/or Linux ports of the game. In large part, this is due to the publisher&#x27;s concern with prioritizing the porting of the primary game itself, when allocating resources for fixing the porting of mod-specific functions may not be cost-effective for the smaller market share of alternate platforms. For example, &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;, ported by Aspyr for Mac OS X, had file access issues specific to mods until the 1.61D patch. &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot; does not have a working community mods menu for the Mac OS X version and, until the 3369 patch, had graphics incompatibilities with several mods such as &quot;Red Orchestra&quot; and &quot;Metaball&quot;.

Also, mods compiled into platform-specific libraries, such as those of &quot;Doom 3&quot;, are often only built for the Windows platform, leading to a lack of cross-platform compatibility even when the underlying game is highly portable. In the same line of reasoning, mod development tools are often available only on the Windows platform. id Software&#x27;s Doom 3 Radiant tool and Epic Games&#x27; UnrealEd are examples of this.

Mod teams that lack either the resources or know-how to develop their mods for alternate platforms sometimes outsource their code and art assets to individuals or groups who are able to port the mod.

The mod specialist site for Macs, Macologist, has created GUI launchers and installers for many UT2004 mods, as well as solving cross-platform conversion issues for mods for other games.

===Unforeseen consequences or benefits of modding===
In January 2005, it was reported that in &quot;The Sims 2&quot; (2004) modifications that changed item and game behavior were unexpectedly being transferred to other players through the official website&#x27;s &quot;exchange&quot; feature, leading to changed game behavior without advance warning.

After the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; mod incident, there were calls from the industry to better control modders. There is concern about mods that show nudity, and Bethesda does not allow mods with such content to be uploaded on its website. Nexus allows for mods which allow nudity as long as nudity is not present in the preview image. One of the most popular mods of this type is Caliente&#x27;s Beautiful Bodies Edition, which allows for body modification in Bethesda&#x27;s &quot;Skyrim&quot; and &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, and has been downloaded at least 8.2 million times.

In 2015, members from the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; fan site GTAForums reported instances of malware being circulated through modifications written for &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. Two of the modifications in question, namely &quot;Angry Planes&quot; and &quot;No Clip&quot;, came with code for loading a remote access tool, and a keylogger for stealing Facebook and Steam account credentials. The modifications in question have since been taken out of circulation, with affected players being advised to change their social media account passwords and disinfect their computers.

The National Crime Agency of the UK has indicated that modding can act as a pathway to cybercrime for some people.

===Motivations of modders===
The Internet provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute user created content like mods, an aspect commonly known as Web 2.0. Video game modding was described as remixing of games and can be therefore seen as part of the remix culture as described by Lawrence Lessig, or as a successor to the playful hacker culture that produced the first video games.

Mods can be both useful to players and a means of self-expression. Three motivations have been identified by Olli Sotamaa for fans to create mods: to patch the game, to express themselves, and to get a foot in the door of the video game industry. It has been noted that these motivations encompass intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Poor suggests becoming a professional is not a major motivation of modders, noting that they tend to have a strong sense of community, and that older modders, who may already have established careers, are less motivated by the possibility of becoming professional than younger modders.

==History==
One of the first games that supported user modifications as packaged was &quot;Lode Runner&quot; (1983), which included a level editor which users could make and save levels to share with other players on the same computer.

id Software&#x27;s &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992), one of the earliest first-person shooters, was released in a form that did not intend for users to be able to mod the game, but users were able to find ways to manipulate the game&#x27;s files after scouring them for data locations to create their own levels and graphics. Because of this, when id developed their next game, &quot;Doom&quot;, they purposely separated the game engine and other aspects related to the game&#x27;s operation from the game levels and graphics, placing these into a WAD file, &quot;WAD&quot; short for &quot;Where&#x27;s All the Data?&quot; In this manner, modders only needed to change the WAD file to mod the game, launching numerous &quot;Doom&quot; modding efforts. id&#x27;s approach of separating data file from execution files became essential for modding of video games in the future.

==Official status of mods==
Mods can extend the shelf life of games, such as &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998), which increased its sales figures over the first three years of its release. According to the director of marketing at Valve, a typical shelf-life for a game would be 12 to 18 months, even if it was a &quot;mega-hit&quot;. In early 2012, the &quot;DayZ&quot; modification for &quot;ARMA 2&quot; was released and caused a massive increase in sales for the three-year-old game, putting it in the top spot for online game sales for a number of months and selling over 300,000 units for the game. In some cases, modders who are against piracy have created mods that enforce the use of a legal game copy.

&quot;Half-Life&quot; had a Valve-run annual mod expo which began in 1999, showcasing the new games built using the &quot;Half-Life&quot; engine.

Due to the increasing popularity and quality of modding, some developers, such as Firaxis, have included fan-made mods in official releases of expansion packs. A similar case is that of Valve, when they hired &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot; lead designer IceFrog in developing &quot;Dota 2&quot;.

For example, a number of fan-made maps, scenarios and mods, such as the &quot;Best of the Net&quot; collection and &quot;Double Your Pleasure&quot;, were included in the &quot;Civilization II&quot; expansion &quot;Fantastic Worlds&quot; and the &quot;Civilization III&quot; expansion &quot;Play the World&quot;, and in the &quot;Civilization IV&quot; expansion &quot;Beyond the Sword&quot;, two existing mods, &quot;Rhye&#x27;s and Fall of Civilization&quot; and &quot;Fall from Heaven&quot; were included with the expansion (the latter through a spin-off called &quot;Age of Ice&quot;). Sid Meier, who had opposed supporting mods in &quot;Civilization II&quot;, said that &quot;the strength of the modding community is ... the very reason the series survived&quot;.

===Legal status of mods===

Copyright law, as it relates to video games and mod packs, is an evolving and largely unsettled legal issue. The legal uncertainty revolves around which party is legally the &#x27;copyright owner&#x27; of the mods within the pack—the company that produced the game, the end-user that created the compilation, or the creators of the individual mods. Video games are protected by copyright law as a &quot;literary work&quot;. In the United States context, the mechanisms of how the modder gets into the code of the game to mod it may violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or even simply the end-user license agreement (EULA). Most EULAs forbid modders from selling their mods. A particular concern of companies is the use of copyrighted material by another company in mods, such as a &quot;Quake&quot; &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; mod, which was legally contested by 20th Century Fox. Some companies, such as Nintendo, discourage modding through aggressive litigation, strict EULAs and Terms and Conditions for their property. Mods themselves may introduce other copyrighted elements into video games which further complicate matters.

Some regard the fan use of copyrighted material in mods to be part of a &quot;moral economy&quot;, and develop norms about the reuse of this material, often settling on a system of shared ownership, where mods and code are freely shared with the common good in mind. It has been argued that total conversion mods may be covered in the United States under the concept of fair use.

Modding can be compared with the open-source-software movement and open-source video game development.

In 2006, part of the reason that &quot;Second Life&quot; generated interest was how user-generated content (mods) was central to the experience, and how the intellectual property rights remained with the creator-player. This was developed by the publisher into a market.

===Controversy surrounding paid mods===

In April 2015, Valve implemented a &quot;paid mod&quot; feature onto Steam; the first game to implement this feature was &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;. The move resulted in a swift backlash from the modding community, and after an enormous influx of complaints of overpriced mods, content that had been published without its creator&#x27;s consent, and concerns over mods that contained third-party copyrighted content (i.e., material that neither Valve nor the mod creator owned), Valve discontinued the &#x27;paid mod&#x27; feature entirely and agreed to refund those that spent money to purchase a mod. Other concerns identified included that being able to mod the game was a reason why players bought the game on PC in the first place, a worry that newbie modders would not be able to stand on the shoulders of giants by modding pre-existing mods, and that mod teams would become unworkable. The removal of the system itself was also criticized.

==Types==
===Total conversion===

A &quot;total conversion&quot; is a mod of an existing game that replaces virtually all of the artistic assets in the original game, and sometimes core aspects of gameplay. Total conversions can result in a completely different genre from the original.

The &quot;Half-Life&quot; modding community splintered across the different total conversions available, often modding for a particular total conversion rather than &quot;Half-Life&quot; in general. Examples of famous total conversions include &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; (1999), whose developers were hired by Valve to turn it into a commercial product, &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot; (2003), which was the first MOBA to have sponsored tournaments, and &quot;Garry&#x27;s Mod&quot; (2006), for which fans created thousands of game modes over its decade-long development.

Many popular total conversions are later turned into standalone games, replacing any remaining original assets to allow for commercial sale without copyright infringement. Some of these mods are even approved for sale despite using the IP of the original game, such as &quot;Black Mesa&quot;.

===Overhaul===
An &quot;overhaul&quot; mod significantly changes an entire game&#x27;s graphics and gameplay, usually with the intent to improve on the original, but not going as far as being a completely different experience. This can also include adding revised dialog and music.

Examples of overhaul mods include &quot;Deus Ex: Revision&quot;, which was given permission from publisher Square Enix to release on Steam alongside the original game, and &quot;GTA 5 Redux&quot;, which not only improves the original game&#x27;s textures, but also adds a new weather system, visual effects, and adjusts the wanted system, weapons, and vehicle handling.

===Randomizer===
Randomizers are a type of user mod, typically atop games of the 8-bit and 16-bit generations, that keep the fundamental gameplay but randomize elements of the game to make it more of a challenge. Randomizers came out of the speedrunning community which had exhausted the challenge of racing through the game with one of the earliest being for &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; around 2015. In the &quot;Zelda&quot; randomizer, the mod moved the location of the dungeons, the layout of these dungeons, and the location of enemies in a random but procedurally generated manner (similar to roguelikes) based on a numerical seed, so that speedrunners would have to overcome these new changes. Their popularity grew as randomizer playthroughs were popular with streaming media. Some games have offered official randomizer modes in the game itself, such as &quot;Cassette Beasts&quot; in 2023, or in downloadable content, including &quot;&quot; in 2020, and &quot;Axiom Verge&quot; in 2021.

===Add-on===

An &quot;add-on&quot; or &quot;addon&quot; is a typically small mod which adds to the original content of a specific game. In most cases, an add-on will add one particular element to a game, such as a new weapon in a shooting game, a new unit or map in a strategy game, a new vehicle or track in a racing game, items in a game like &quot;Minecraft&quot; or &quot;Terraria&quot;, or additional contents in simulation games (such as new pilotable airplanes, e.g., the Airbus A330 or Boeing 787 Dreamliner). An example of a mod that adds functionality to augment or enhance a players experience is ComputerCraft; a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers and robots to allow the player to automate tasks in-game. This can be accomplished without changing any of the original game&#x27;s existing content. Many games are flexible and allow this, however that is not always the case. Some add-ons occasionally have to replace in-game content, due to the nature of a peculiar game engine. It may be the case, for example, that in a game which does not give a player the option to choose their character, modders wishing to add another player model will simply have to overwrite the old one. A famous example of this type of mod can be found for the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series wherein modders may use downloadable tools to replace content (such as models) in the game&#x27;s directory. The &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; series can also be modded with individual add-ons which are stored in a format, so that a player may choose to activate a given mod or not.

===Unofficial patch===
An &quot;unofficial patch&quot; can be a mod of an existing game that fixes bugs not fixed by an official patch or that unlocks content present in the released game&#x27;s files but is inaccessible in official gameplay. Such patches are usually created by members of the game&#x27;s fan base when the original developer is unwilling or unable to supply the functionality officially. &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; has an unofficial patch which adds and fixes many of its features. One effect of this type of mod is that hidden or partially deleted content can be revealed. An example is the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; mod for &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, which unlocks a sexually explicit minigame. The ESRB changed the rating of &quot;GTA:SA&quot; from &quot;Mature&quot; (M) to &quot;Adults Only&quot; (AO). In the fourth quarter of 2005, Rockstar released a &quot;clean&quot; version of the game with the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; scenes removed (&quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; 1.01), allowing the rating of the game to be reverted to its original &quot;Mature&quot; rating. In May 2006, a similar event occurred with &quot;Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;.

===Art mod===
An &quot;art mod&quot; is a mod that is created for artistic effect. Art mods are most frequently associated with video game art. However, modified games that retain their playability and are subject to more extensive mods (i.e. closer to total conversions) may also be classified as art games. Art mods are usually designed to subvert the original game experience. One example is the &quot;Velvet-Strike&quot; mod for &quot;Counter Strike&quot; in which the players spray-paint anti-violence messages in multiplayer games as a form of performance art. Another example is Robert Nideffer&#x27;s &quot;Tomb Raider I and II&quot; patches which were designed to subvert the unofficial &quot;Nude Raider&quot; patch of the late 1990s by altering Lara Croft&#x27;s sexual orientation. The origins of the art mod can be traced to the classic 1983 mod &quot;Castle Smurfenstein&quot; (a humorous subversion of &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; which replaces the Nazi guards with Smurfs). The very first art mod, however, is generally considered to be Iimura Takahiko&#x27;s 1993 &quot;AIUEOUNN Six Features&quot; (a modification of Sony&#x27;s &quot;System G&quot;).

=== Support continuation by mod ===
After EA lost its license with Major League Baseball and ended support for &quot;MVP Baseball 2005&quot;, the game&#x27;s modding community has continued to support it by releasing updated roster lists and graphics every year, along with creating alternative baseball leagues (e.g. MVP Caribe, a total conversion) in the game.

&quot;IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover&quot;, released in 2011, received mixed reviews due to bugs and other issues. Modders fixed the game over time and received source code access, which led to an official re-release under the name &quot;IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover BLITZ Edition&quot;.

Following the closure of Ion Storm the source code to &quot;Daikatana&quot; was released to a select group of modders by John Romero, leading the version 1.3 patch, which also ported the game to MacOS, Linux and FreeBSD.

Some online video games are made playable after their discontinuation by modders. Examples include BattleForge, Need for Speed: World, and The Crew.

===User interface mod===
A user interface mod changes parts of how players interact with the game, and commonly, mods to the UI reveal information that the player or modder believes is helpful in playing the game.

===Mod packs===
Mod packs are groups of mods put into one package for download, often with an auto-installer. A mod pack&#x27;s purpose is to make it easier for the player to install and manage multiple mods. Mod packs may be created with the purpose of making the original game more accessible to new players or to make the game harder for veterans to enjoy.
