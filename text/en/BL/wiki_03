<text>The three species of kākāriki (also spelled &quot;kakariki&quot;, without macrons), or New Zealand parakeets, are the most common species of parakeets in the genus &quot;Cyanoramphus&quot;, family Psittaculidae. The most commonly used name &quot;kākāriki&quot; is Māori in origin meaning &quot;small parrot&quot; (from &quot;kākā&quot; ‘parrot’ and &quot;riki&quot; ‘small’); it has also been used to refer to the colour green because of the birds&#x27; predominantly green plumage. The patches of red on the birds&#x27; rumps are, according to legend, the blood of the demigod Tāwhaki.

The three species on mainland New Zealand are the yellow-crowned parakeet (&quot;Cyanoramphus auriceps&quot;), the red-crowned parakeet, or red-fronted parakeet (&quot;C. novaezelandiae&quot;), and the critically endangered Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet or orange-fronted parakeet (&quot;C. malherbi&quot; – not to be confused with &quot;Eupsittula canicularis&quot; a popular aviary bird known as the orange-fronted conure, orange-fronted parakeet or half-moon conure).
== Habitat ==

All above species are native to New Zealand, and have become endangered as a result of habitat destruction following human settlement and nest predation by introduced mammals. Scarce on the mainland, kākāriki have survived well on outlying islands. They are easy to breed, but as with all protected native species in New Zealand, a licence from the Department of Conservation is required to keep them in captivity.

Mitochondrial DNA analysis has indicated that the orange-fronted parakeet is a separate species and not just a colour variation of the yellow-crowned parakeet. The orange-fronted parakeet is highly endangered, with less than 200 individuals remaining in the North Canterbury region of the South Island. Furthermore, Chatham Island&#x27;s yellow-crowned parakeet and the red-crowned populations of New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, and the subantarctic islands have been determined to be distinct species.

The identification and detection of sex are very important for the protection of Kākāriki. Understanding the sex ratios within populations helps in managing breeding programs and maintaining balanced demographics in captivity, contributing to the preservation of this species. Accurate sex testing plays a pivotal role in effective population management and conservation strategies for Kākāriki.

<doc id="393671" wikidata="Q571227" url="?curid=393671" title="Implicature">
<text>In pragmatics, a subdiscipline of linguistics, an implicature is something the speaker suggests or implies with an utterance, even though it is not literally expressed. Implicatures can aid in communicating more efficiently than by explicitly saying everything we want to communicate. The philosopher H. P. Grice coined the term in 1975. Grice distinguished &quot;conversational&quot; implicatures, which arise because speakers are expected to respect general rules of conversation, and &quot;conventional&quot; ones, which are tied to certain words such as &quot;but&quot; or &quot;therefore&quot;. Take for example the following exchange:

: A (to passerby): I am out of gas.
: B: There is a gas station &#x27;round the corner.

Here, B does not say, but &quot;conversationally implicates&quot;, that the gas station is open, because otherwise his utterance would not be relevant in the context. Conversational implicatures are classically seen as contrasting with entailments: they are not necessary or logical consequences of what is said, but are defeasible (cancellable). So, B could continue without contradiction:

: B: But unfortunately it&#x27;s closed today.

An example of a conventional implicature is &quot;Donovan is poor but happy&quot;, where the word &quot;but&quot; implicates a sense of contrast between being poor and being happy.

Later linguists introduced refined and different definitions of the term, leading to somewhat different ideas about which parts of the information conveyed by an utterance are actually implicatures and which are not.

==Conversational implicature==
Grice was primarily concerned with conversational implicatures. Like all implicatures, these are part of what is communicated. In other words, conclusions the addressee draws from an utterance although they were not actively conveyed by the communicator are never implicatures. According to Grice, conversational implicatures arise because communicating people are expected by their addressees to obey the maxims of conversation and the overarching cooperative principle, which basically states that people are expected to communicate in a cooperative, helpful way.

===Standard implicatures===
The simplest situation is where the addressee can draw conclusions from the assumption that the communicator obeys the maxims, as in the following examples. The symbol &quot;+&gt;&quot; means &quot;implicates&quot;.

; Quality
: It is raining. +&gt; I believe, and have adequate evidence, that it is raining.
Moore&#x27;s paradox, the observation that the sentence &quot;It is raining, but I don&#x27;t believe that it is raining&quot; sounds contradictory although it is not from a strictly logical point of view, has been explained as a contradiction to this type of implicature. However, as implicatures can be cancelled (see below), this explanation is dubious.

; Quantity (i)
A well-known class of quantity implicatures are the scalar implicatures. Prototypical examples include words specifying quantities such as &quot;some&quot;, &quot;few&quot;, or &quot;many&quot;:
: John ate &quot;some&quot; of the cookies. +&gt; John didn&#x27;t eat &quot;all&quot; of the cookies.
Here, the use of &quot;some&quot; semantically entails that more than one cookie was eaten. It does not entail, but implicates, that not every cookie was eaten, or at least that the speaker does not know whether any cookies are left. The reason for this implicature is that saying &quot;some&quot; when one could say &quot;all&quot; would be less than informative enough in most circumstances. The general idea is that the communicator is expected to make the strongest possible claim, implicating the negation of any stronger claim. Lists of expressions that give rise to scalar implicatures, sorted from strong to weak, are known as Horn scales:
* ⟨all, many, some, few⟩
* ⟨..., four, three, two, one⟩ (cardinal number terms)
* ⟨always, often, sometimes⟩
* ⟨and, or⟩
* ⟨necessarily, possibly⟩
* ⟨hot, warm⟩
* etc.

Negation reverses these scales, as in this example:
: She won&#x27;t necessarily get the job. +&gt; She will possibly get the job.
&quot;Not possibly&quot; is stronger than &quot;not necessarily&quot;, and the implicature follows from the double negation &quot;She will not [not possibly] get the job&quot;.

Here are some further implicatures that can be classified as scalar:
: I slept on a boat yesterday. +&gt; The boat was not mine.
This is a common construction where the indefinite article indicates that the referent is not closely associated with the speaker, because the stronger claim &quot;I slept on my boat yesterday&quot; is not made.

: The flag is green. +&gt; The flag is completely green.
If this is the strongest possible claim, it follows that the flag has no other features, because &quot;The flag is green and some other colour&quot; would be stronger. In other words, if it did contain other features, this utterance would not be informative enough.

;Quantity (ii)
The second quantity maxim seems to work in the opposite direction as the first; the communicator makes a weaker claim, from which a stronger one is implicated. Implicatures arising from this maxim enrich the information contained in the utterance:
: He drank a bottle of vodka and fell into a stupor. +&gt; He drank a bottle of vodka and &quot;consequently&quot; fell into a stupor.
: I lost a book yesterday. +&gt; The book was mine.
There is extensive literature, but no consensus on the question which of the two quantity maxims is in operation in which circumstances; i.e. why &quot;I lost a book yesterday&quot; implicates that the book was the speaker&#x27;s, while &quot;I slept on a boat yesterday&quot; usually implicates that the boat wasn&#x27;t the speaker&#x27;s.

;Relation/relevance
: That cake looks delicious. +&gt; I would like a piece of that cake.
This statement taken by itself would be irrelevant in most situations, so the addressee concludes that the speaker had something more in mind.

The introductory example also belongs here:
: A: I am out of gas.
: B: There is a gas station &#x27;round the corner. +&gt; The gas station is open.

; Manner (iv)
: The cowboy jumped on his horse and rode into the sunset. +&gt; The cowboy performed these two actions in this order.
Being orderly includes relating events in the order they occurred.

===Clashes of maxims===
Sometimes it is impossible to obey all maxims at once. Suppose that A and B are planning a holiday in France and A suggests they visit their old acquaintance Gérard:
: A: Where does Gérard live?
: B: Somewhere in the South of France. +&gt; B does not know where exactly Gérard lives.
B&#x27;s answer violates the first maxim of quantity as it does not contain sufficient information to plan their route. But if B does not know the exact location, she cannot obey this maxim &quot;and also&quot; the maxim of quality; hence the implicature.

===Floutings===
The maxims can also be blatantly disobeyed or &quot;flouted&quot;, giving rise to another kind of conversational implicature. This is possible because addressees will go to great lengths in saving their assumption that the communicator did in fact – perhaps on a deeper level – obey the maxims and the cooperative principle. Many figures of speech can be explained by this mechanism.

;Quality (i)
Saying something that is obviously false can produce irony, meiosis, hyperbole and metaphor:
: When she heard about the rumour, she exploded.
As it is improbable that she really exploded, and it is highly unlikely that the speaker wanted to lie or was simply mistaken, the addressee has to assume the utterance was meant to be metaphorical.

;Quantity (i)
Utterances that are not informative on the surface include tautologies. They have no logical content and hence no entailments, but can still be used to convey information via implicatures:
: War is war.

Damning with faint praise also works by flouting the first quantity maxim. Consider the following testimonial for a philosophy student:
:Dear Sir, Mr. X&#x27;s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours, etc.
The implicature here is that the student is no good, since the teacher has nothing better to say about him.

;Relation/relevance
B&#x27;s answer in the following exchange does not seem to be relevant, so A concludes that B wanted to convey something else:
: A: Mrs Jenkins is an old windbag, don&#x27;t you think?
: B: Lovely weather for March, isn&#x27;t it? +&gt; Watch out, her nephew is standing right behind you! (or the like)

;Manner (iii)
This utterance is much more long-winded than &quot;Miss Singer sang an aria from &quot;Rigoletto&quot;&quot; and therefore flouts the maxim &quot;Be brief&quot;:
: Miss Singer produced a series of sounds corresponding closely to the score of an aria from &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. +&gt; What Miss Singer produced cannot really be described as an aria from &quot;Rigoletto&quot;.

===Particularized versus generalized implicatures===
Conversational implicatures that arise only in specific contexts are called &quot;particularized&quot;, while those that are not or only slightly context dependent are &quot;generalized&quot;. Many of the examples above rely on some context, making them particularized implicatures: thus, &quot;War is war&quot; can refer to different properties of war, or things expected to happen during war, depending on the situation in which it is uttered. Prototypical examples of generalized implicatures are the scalar implicatures. Particularized implicatures are by far the more common kind.

===Properties===
Grice attributed a number of properties to conversational implicatures:

They are &quot;defeasible&quot; (cancellable), meaning that the implicature may be cancelled by further information or context. Take the examples from above:
: That cake looks delicious. +&gt; I would like a piece of that cake.
: versus: That cake looks delicious, but it looks too rich for me. (implicature defeated)

: A: Did John eat some of the cookies?
: B: He certainly did eat some of the cookies. In fact he ate them all.

They are usually &quot;non-detachable&quot; in the sense that they cannot be &quot;detached&quot; by rephrasing the utterance, as they are consequences of the meaning and not the wording. The obvious exception are implicatures following from the maxim of manner, which explicitly relies on the phrasing. Thus, the following utterances have the same implicature as above:
: That fruit cake there looks appetizing.
: The dessert you brought is really mouthwatering.

Conversational implicatures are &quot;calculable&quot;: they are supposed to be formally derivable from the literal meaning of the utterance in combination with the cooperative principle and the maxims, as well as contextual information and background knowledge.

They are &quot;non-conventional&quot;, that is, they are not part of the &quot;conventional&quot; (lexical and logical) meaning of a sentence.

Lastly, they can be &quot;context dependent&quot;, as mentioned above.

===Opting out of the cooperative principle===
The cooperative principle and the maxims of conversation are not mandatory. A communicator can choose not to be cooperative; she can &quot;opt out&quot; of the cooperative principle by giving appropriate clues such as saying &quot;My lips are sealed&quot;, or for example during a cross-examination at court. In such situations, no conversational implicatures arise.

===Modifications to Grice&#x27;s maxims===
;Laurence Horn
Various modifications to Grice&#x27;s maxims have been proposed by other linguists, the so-called neo-Griceans. Laurence Horn&#x27;s approach keeps the maxims of quality and replaces the other maxims with just two principles:
* The Q-principle: Make your contribution sufficient; say as much as you can (given the quality maxims and the R-principle).
* The R-principle: Make your contribution necessary; say no more than you must (given the Q-principle).
The Q-principle replaces the first quantity maxim (&quot;make your contribution as informative as is required&quot;) and the first and second manner maxims (&quot;avoid obscurity and ambiguity&quot;), and is taken to serve the interests of the hearer, who wants as much information as possible. It thus gives rise to the classical scalar implicatures. The R-principle subsumes the second quantity maxim (&quot;do not make your contribution more informative than is required&quot;), the maxim of relation, and the remaining manner maxims (&quot;be brief and orderly&quot;), and serves the interests of the speaker, who wants to communicate with as little effort as possible. These two principles have opposite effects analogous to Grice&#x27;s two maxims of quantity. To determine which of the two principles is used, Horn introduces the concept of &quot;division of pragmatic labor&quot;: unmarked (shorter, standard, more lexicalized) phrasings tend to R-implicate a standard meaning, and marked (more wordy, unusual, less lexicalized) phrasings tend to Q-implicate a nonstandard meaning:
: She stopped the machine. +&gt; She stopped the machine &quot;in the usual way&quot;. (R-implicature: a stronger, more specific claim is implicated)
: She got the machine to stop. +&gt; She did not stop the machine in the usual way. (Q-implicature: the stronger claim is negated, as with scalar implicatures)

Horn&#x27;s account has been criticised for misrepresenting the speaker&#x27;s and hearer&#x27;s interests: realistically, the hearer does not want a lot of information but just the relevant information; and the speaker is more interested in being understood than in having little work to do. Furthermore, as in Grice&#x27;s theory, there is often no explanation for when which of the two principles is used, i.e. why &quot;I lost a book yesterday&quot; has the Q-implicature, or scalar implicature, that the book was the speaker&#x27;s, while &quot;I slept on a boat yesterday&quot; R-implicates that the boat wasn&#x27;t the speaker&#x27;s.

;Stephen Levinson
Stephen Levinson&#x27;s approach is similar to Horn&#x27;s. His Q-principle is basically the same, but its antagonist, the I-principle, only takes the place of the second quantity maxim. There is a separate M-principle more or less corresponding to the third and fourth manner maxims, as well as to Horn&#x27;s division of pragmatic labor; but there is no replacement for the maxim of relation.
* The M-principle: Indicate abnormal, nonstereotypical situations by using marked expressions that contrast with those you would use to describe the corresponding normal, stereotypical situations.

Levinson subsequently developed a theory of generalized conversational implicature (GCI) based on the Q-principle. He argues that GCIs are distinct from particularized conversational implicatures in that they are inferred via a specialized set of principles and rules that are always in force, independent of the context. If a GCI does not arise in some specific situations, this is because it is blocked under certain circumstances according to Levinson.

===Criticism===
Apart from the mentioned problem with the two opposing quantity maxims, several issues with Grice&#x27;s conversational implicatures have been raised:

;Do implicatures contrast with entailments?
While Grice described conversational implicatures as contrasting with entailments, there has since been dissent.
: A: Did you drive somewhere yesterday?
: B: I drove to London.
Here, B implicates via the maxim of relation that he drove somewhere (as this is the fitting answer to A&#x27;s question), but this information is also entailed by his answer.

;Are quantity implicatures actually implicatures?
At least some scalar and other quantity &quot;implicatures&quot; seem not to be implicatures at all but semantic enrichments of the utterance, what is variously described as an explicature or impliciture in the literature. For example, Kent Bach argues that a sentence like &quot;John ate some of the cookies&quot; does not implicate &quot;John didn&#x27;t eat all of the cookies&quot; because the latter is not a claim separate from the first; rather, the speaker just has a single meaning in mind, namely &quot;John ate some &quot;[but not all]&quot; of the cookies&quot;. Likewise, Robyn Carston considers cases like &quot;He drank a bottle of vodka and &quot;[consequently]&quot; fell into a stupor&quot; explicatures; however, she considers the question of classical scalar implicatures (&quot;some, few, many&quot;) to be unsettled.

;Can metaphors only arise when the first maxim of quality is flouted?
As experimental evidence shows, it is not necessary to evaluate the truth of an utterance&#x27;s literal meaning in order to recognise a metaphor. An example of a metaphor that is &quot;also&quot; literally true is a chess player telling his opponent, in appropriate circumstances,
:Your defence is an impregnable castle.

;Are events always related in order?
Apparent counterexamples to the maxim &quot;be orderly&quot; have been found, such as this:
: A: My wife wants me to remove our carpets. She is afraid she might trip and hurt herself, but I think she is just overanxious.
: B: Well, I don&#x27;t know. John broke his leg and &quot;he&quot; tripped over a doormat.

;Are there particularized and generalized implicatures?
Carston observes that particularized and generalized conversational implicatures are not separate categories; rather, there is a continuum from implicatures that are highly dependent on a specific situation which is unlikely to happen twice, to ones that occur very frequently. In her view, the distinction has no theoretical value since all implicatures are derived from the same principles.

;Can implicatures only arise when the communicator is cooperative?
Take the above example about Gérard&#x27;s place of residence. If B knows where Gérard lives, and A knows this, we also get an implicature, although a different one:
: A: Where does Gérard live?
: B: Somewhere in the South of France. +&gt; B does not want to say where exactly Gérard lives. +&gt; B does not want to visit Gérard.
This contradicts Grice&#x27;s notion that implicatures can only arise when the communicator observes the cooperative principle.

==Implicature in relevance theory==
In the framework known as relevance theory, implicature is defined as a counterpart to explicature. The explicatures of an utterance are the communicated assumptions that are developed from its logical form (intuitively, the literal meaning) by supplying additional information from context: by disambiguating ambiguous expressions, assigning referents to pronouns and other variables, and so on. All communicated assumptions that cannot be obtained in this way are implicatures. For example, if Peter says

: Susan told me that her kiwis were too sour.

in the context that Susan participated in a fruit grower&#x27;s contest, the hearer might arrive at the explicature

: Susan told Peter that the kiwifruit she, Susan, grew were too sour for the judges at the fruit grower&#x27;s contest.
Now assume that Peter and the hearer both have access to the contextual information that
: Susan is ambitious. If she loses at something, she&#x27;s pretty downcast.
and that Peter intended the hearer to activate this knowledge. Then this is an &quot;implicated premise&quot;. The hearer can now draw the &quot;contextual implications&quot; that
: +&gt; Susan needs to be cheered up.
: +&gt; Peter wants me to ring Susan and cheer her up.
If Peter intended the hearer to come to these implications, they are &quot;implicated conclusions&quot;. Implicated premises and conclusions are the two types of implicatures in the relevance theoretical sense.

There is no sharp cutoff between implicatures, which are part of the intentional meaning of an utterance, and unintended implications the addressee may draw. For example, there may be no consensus whether
: ?+&gt; Peter wants me to buy Susan some chocolate to cheer her up.
is an implicature of the above utterance. We say this assumption is only &quot;weakly implicated&quot;, while &quot;Susan needs to be cheered up&quot; is essential for the utterance to achieve relevance for the addressee and is therefore &quot;strongly implicated&quot;.

===The principle of relevance===

Both explicatures and implicatures follow from the communicative principle of relevance, which unlike Grice&#x27;s cooperative principle is not optional, but is always in force whenever someone communicates – it is descriptive of, not prescriptive for, communicative acts. Consequently, implicatures can arise even if, or precisely because, the communicator is uncooperative. Relevance theory can therefore effortlessly account for the above example about Gérard: If B knows where Gérard lives, and &quot;Somewhere in the South of France&quot; is the most relevant answer compatible with B&#x27;s preferences, it follows that B is unwilling to disclose his knowledge.

===Distinction from explicatures===
All pragmatically derived information, including parts of explicatures that are supplied from context, is calculable and defeasible. Therefore, different criteria are needed in relevance theory to identify implicatures.

Sperber and Wilson originally assumed that implicatures can be sufficiently defined as the communicated assumptions that are not developed from an utterance&#x27;s logical form, as noted above. On this account, loose language use (saying &quot;This steak is raw&quot; to express that it is really undercooked) is a case of implicature, as are hyperbole and metaphor.

Carston has argued for a more formal approach, namely that an utterance&#x27;s implicatures cannot entail any of its explicatures. If they did, the resulting redundancies would cause unnecessary effort on part of the addressee, which would run against the principle of relevance. An example of pragmatically derived information that has traditionally been seen as an implicature, but must be an explicature according to Carston&#x27;s reasoning, has already been mentioned above: &quot;He drank a bottle of vodka and fell into a stupor&quot; → &quot;He drank a bottle of vodka and &quot;consequently&quot; fell into a stupor&quot;. However, there has since been found at least one example of an implicature that does entail an explicature, showing that this test is not infallible:
: A: Did Jim go to the party?
: B: I don&#x27;t know, but I can tell you that if &quot;anybody&quot; was there, Jim was there.
: A: &quot;Somebody&quot; was there – this I know for sure. (I saw John going there.) +&gt; Jim was there. (entails: Somebody was there.)

Another possible criterion is that explicatures, but not implicatures, can be embedded in negations, if clauses and other grammatical constructions. Thus, the sentences
: Susan did not tell Peter that her kiwis were too sour.
: If Susan has told Peter that her kiwis were too sour, she was just fishing for compliments.
are equivalent to
: Susan did not tell Peter that the kiwifruit she, Susan, grew were too sour for the judges.
: If Susan told Peter that the kiwifruit she, Susan, grew were too sour for the judges, she was just fishing for compliments.
respectively, showing the embedded clause to be an explicature. On the other hand, they are not equivalent to embeddings of the mentioned implicature:
: *Susan does not need to be cheered up.
: *If Susan needs to be cheered up, she is just fishing for compliments.
These embedding tests also show the vodka bottle example to be an explicature. However, there is still no generally accepted criterion to reliably distinguish explicatures and implicatures.

===Poetic effects===
Metaphors can be an efficient means to communicate a wide range of weak implicatures. For example,
: Jane is my anchor in the storm.
can weakly implicate that Jane is reliable and stable in difficult circumstances, helpful in calming the speaker, and so on. Even if the speaker had no specific set of assumptions in mind, this information can give the addressee an idea of Jane&#x27;s significance to the speaker&#x27;s life.

Speaking generally, utterances convey poetic effects if they achieve all or most of their relevance through a range of weak implicatures. For example, the repetition in
: My childhood days are gone, gone.
does not add to the utterance&#x27;s explicature, prompting the addressee to search for implicatures. To do so, he has to activate contextual (background) information about childhood memories.

Irony is seen as an entirely different phenomenon in relevance theory; see Relevance theory#Interpretation vs. description for an explanation.

===Criticism===
Levinson sees relevance theory as too reductionist, as a single principle cannot account for the large variety of implicatures in his view. In particular, he argues that this theory cannot account for generalized implicatures because it is inherently a theory of context dependency. This argument is countered by Carston, as mentioned above. Also, Levinson asserts that relevance theory cannot explain how we arrive at implicated premises via creative processes.

The foundations of relevance theory have been criticised because relevance, in the technical sense it is used there, cannot be measured, so it is not possible to say what exactly is meant by &quot;relevant enough&quot; and &quot;the most relevant&quot;.

Carston generally agrees with the relevance theoretic concept of implicature, but argues that Sperber and Wilson let implicatures do too much work. The mentioned embedding tests not only categorize utterances on the likes of the vodka bottle example as explicatures, but also loose use and metaphors:
: If your steak is raw, you can send it back.
: If Jane is your anchor in the storm, you should let her help you now.
She does not explain metaphors&#x27; wide range of effects with weak implicatures. Instead, she advocates the idea that the meaning of words and phrases can be adapted to fit specific contexts; in other words, new concepts that differ from the standard meaning can be constructed ad hoc during communication. In the above metaphor, the phrase &quot;anchor in the storm&quot; has many slightly different ad-hoc meanings, and no specific one is exclusively communicated. Carston also discusses the possibility that metaphors cannot be fully explained by communicated assumptions at all, be they explicatures or implicatures, but with other concepts such as evoking mental images, sensations and feelings.

==Conventional implicature==
Conventional implicatures, briefly introduced but never elaborated on by Grice, are independent of the cooperative principle and the four maxims. They are instead tied to the conventional meaning of certain particles and phrases such as &quot;but, although, however, nevertheless, moreover, anyway, whereas, after all, even, yet, still, besides&quot;, verbs such as &quot;deprive, spare&quot;, and possibly also to grammatical structures. (Such words and phrases are also said to &quot;trigger&quot; conventional implicatures.) In addition, they are not defeasible, but have the force of entailments. An example:
: Donovan is poor &quot;but&quot; happy.
This sentence is logically equivalent to – that is, it has the same truth conditions as – &quot;Donovan is poor &quot;and&quot; happy&quot;. In addition, the word &quot;but&quot; implicates a sense of contrast. Taken together, the sentence means approximately &quot;Surprisingly, Donovan is happy despite being poor&quot;.

The verbs &quot;deprive&quot; and &quot;spare&quot; also have the same truth conditions but different conventional implicatures. Compare:
: I have deprived you of my lecture. +&gt; Attending my lecture would have been desirable (for you).
:I have spared you my lecture. +&gt; Attending my lecture would not have been desirable (for you).
Non-restrictive supplements such as the following adjective phrase have been argued to be grammatical structures that produce conventional implicatures:
: Yewberry jelly, &quot;toxic in the extreme&quot;, will give you an awful stomach ache.
The implicature here is that yewberry jelly is toxic in the extreme. Other such constructions are non-restrictive appositives, relative clauses and as-parentheticals:
:Ravel, &quot;as a Frenchman&quot;, nevertheless wrote Spanish-style music.

===Criticism===
Because of the mentioned differences to conversational (and relevance theoretical) implicatures, it has been argued that &quot;conventional implicatures&quot; are not implicatures at all but rather secondary propositions or entailments of an utterance. Under this view, the sentence about Donovan would have the primary proposition &quot;Donovan is poor and happy&quot; and the secondary proposition &quot;There is a contrast between poverty and happiness&quot;. The sentence about yewberry jelly contains the two propositions &quot;Yewberry jelly will give you an awful stomachache&quot; and &quot;Yewberry jelly is toxic in the extreme&quot;.

Other analyses of &quot;but&quot; and similar words have been proposed. Rieber takes above sentence to mean &quot;Donovan is poor and (I suggest this contrasts) happy&quot; and calls it a &quot;tacit (i.e. silent, implied) performative&quot;. Blakemore claims that &quot;but&quot; does not convey a proposition, and does not work by encoding a concept at all, but by constraining the addressee&#x27;s interpretation procedure. In our example, &quot;but&quot; indicates that &quot;Donovan is happy&quot; is relevant specifically as a denial of an expectation created by &quot;Donovan is poor&quot;, and rules out the possibility that it is relevant in any other way. This expectation must be on the lines of &quot;Poor people are unhappy&quot;. Blakemore&#x27;s idea that not only concepts but also procedures can be encoded in language has been taken up by many other researchers.

<text>Cyanoramphus is a genus of parakeets native to New Zealand and islands of the southern Pacific Ocean. The New Zealand species are locally called &quot;kākāriki&quot;. They are small to medium-sized parakeets with long tails and predominantly green plumage. Most species are forest dwellers, although several of the subantarctic species live in open grassland. The genus formerly had a widely disjunct distribution; while most of the genus ranged from New Caledonia to Macquarie Island, two species were found in the Society Islands, away from the rest.

Like many other species of birds, the &quot;Cyanoramphus&quot; parakeets have suffered from changes brought about by humans. The two species from the Society Islands, the black-fronted parakeet and the Society parakeet, are now extinct, as are the taxa from Lord Howe Island and Macquarie Island, and an undescribed Campbell Island form. One species, Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet (&quot;C. malherbi&quot;), is critically endangered, while most other species are endangered or vulnerable. Habitat loss and introduced species are considered responsible for the declines and extinctions.

The genus &quot;Cyanoramphus&quot; was introduced in 1854 by French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;kuanos&quot; meaning &quot;dark-blue&quot; and &quot;rhamphos&quot; meaning &quot;bill&quot;. The type species was designated by English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1855 as what is now the extinct black-fronted parakeet (&quot;Cyanoramphus zealandicus&quot;).

==Species==

Of the 12 recognised species, four are extinct:











Also, subfossil remains have been found from a yet undescribed extinct species from Campbell Island, New Zealand.

<doc id="393674" wikidata="Q656082" url="?curid=393674" title="Anything Goes">
<text>Anything Goes is a musical with music and lyrics by Cole Porter. The original book was a collaborative effort by Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse, revised considerably by the team of Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse. The story concerns madcap antics aboard an ocean liner bound from New York to London. Billy Crocker is a stowaway in love with heiress Hope Harcourt, who is engaged to Lord Evelyn Oakleigh. Nightclub singer Reno Sweeney and Public Enemy Number 13, &quot;Moonface&quot; Martin, aid Billy in his quest to win Hope. Songs introduced that later became pop and jazz standards are &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot;, &quot;All Through the Night&quot;, and &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You&quot;.

Since its 1934 debut at the Alvin Theatre (now known as the Neil Simon Theatre) on Broadway, the musical has been revived several times in the United States and Britain. It has been adapted for film three times (in 1936, 1956 and a filmed version of a stage production in 2021), and adapted for television also three times (in 1950, 1954 and 1962). The musical has long been a popular choice for school and community productions.

==History==
The original idea for a musical set on board an ocean liner came from producer Vinton Freedley, who was living on a boat, having left the US to avoid his creditors. He selected the writing team, P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton, and the star, Ethel Merman. The first draft of the show was called &quot;Crazy Week,&quot; which became &quot;Hard to Get,&quot; and finally &quot;Anything Goes.&quot; The original plot involved a bomb threat, a shipwreck, and human trafficking on a desert island, but, just a few weeks before the show was due to open, a fire on board the passenger ship SS &quot;Morro Castle&quot; caused the deaths of 138 passengers and crew members. According to one version, Freedley judged that to proceed with a show on a similar subject would be in dubious taste, and he insisted on changes to the script. However, theatre historian Lee Davis maintains that Freedley wanted the script changed because it was &quot;a hopeless mess&quot;. Bolton and Wodehouse were in England at the time and were thus no longer available, so Freedley turned to his director, Howard Lindsay, to write a new book. Lindsay recruited press agent Russel Crouse as his collaborator, beginning a lifelong writing partnership. The roles of Billy Crocker and Moonface Martin were written for the well-known comedy team William Gaxton and Victor Moore, and Gaxton&#x27;s talent for assuming various disguises was featured in the libretto.

== Plot summary ==
Four versions of the libretto of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; exist: the original 1934 libretto, the 1962 off-Broadway revival libretto, the 1987 revival libretto, and the 2011 revival libretto. The story has been revised, though all involve similar romantic complications aboard the SS &quot;American&quot; and feature the same major characters. The score has been altered, with some songs cut and others reassigned to different scenes and characters, and augmented with various Porter songs from other shows.

===Original version (1934)===

====Act I====
Billy Crocker, a young Wall Street broker, has fallen in love with a beautiful girl he met at a party and spent the evening in a taxi. His boss, Elisha J. Whitney, is preparing to make a business deal and is going to travel to London aboard the SS &quot;American&quot;. Evangelist turned nightclub singer Reno Sweeney will be traveling aboard the same ship. Billy sees Reno as a friend, but she obviously has feelings for him (&quot;I Get a Kick Out of You&quot;). Billy goes to the dock to say farewell to his boss and Reno (&quot;Bon Voyage&quot;), and glimpses the mysterious girl again. He learns that she is heiress Hope Harcourt and, escorted by her mother, Mrs. Harcourt, is on her way to England with her fiancé Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, a handsome but stuffy and hapless British nobleman. Billy stows away on the ship in hopes of winning Hope&#x27;s heart. &quot;Moonface&quot; Martin, a second-rate gangster labeled &quot;Public Enemy 13&quot;, and his girlfriend, Bonnie, have disguised themselves as a minister and a missionary and, innocently aided by Billy, board the ship under their assumed identities, stranding the ship&#x27;s real chaplain back at the port. Moonface and Bonnie mistakenly leave behind their leader, &quot;Snake Eyes&quot; Johnson, Public Enemy 1.

To thank him, Bonnie and Moonface let Billy have Snake Eyes Johnson&#x27;s passport and ticket without telling him to whom they belong. Billy cons Evelyn into leaving him alone with Hope, by convincing him he is very ill. When he goes to get some air, Billy and Hope meet again, and it turns out she has been unable to stop thinking about him as well (&quot;All Through the Night&quot;). Though Hope prefers Billy, she insists she must marry Evelyn, though she gives no reason. Unbeknownst to Billy, her family&#x27;s company is in financial trouble and a marriage to Evelyn would promote a merger and save it. The ship&#x27;s crew gets a cable from New York saying that Public Enemy 1 is on board. Moonface admits his true identity to Billy and he and Bonnie conspire to disguise Billy as a crew member since he is now presumed to be Snake Eyes Johnson.

A quartet of lovelorn sailors comfort themselves with the thought of romance when they reach shore (&quot;There&#x27;ll Always Be a Lady Fair&quot;). On deck, Bonnie lures the sailors to her (&quot;Where Are the Men?&quot;), then steals the clothes of one of the men for Billy.

Hope discusses her impending marriage with Evelyn and discovers that he is not particularly pleased with the engagement either. Billy asks Reno to help separate Evelyn and Hope, and she agrees. Billy and Reno reaffirm their friendship, (&quot;It&#x27;s Friendship&quot;). Reno tries to charm Evelyn, she succeeds, and he invites her for a drink in his cabin. She and Moon plot that Moon should burst into the cabin and discover Reno half-naked in Evelyn&#x27;s arms, providing sufficient reason for breaking off the engagement. However, when Moon breaks into the room, machine gun in tow, he instead sees Reno fully dressed and Evelyn nearly undressed. Moon tries to invent some indecent explanation for the situation, but Evelyn insists that he would be quite pleased by any rumor depicting him as a passionate lover, especially if Hope heard it. Moon admits that the plot has failed.

The crew discover that Billy is not a sailor, and Moon and Reno create a new disguise for him from a stolen pair of trousers, a jacket taken from a drunken passenger, and hair cut from Mrs. Harcourt&#x27;s Pomeranian and made into a beard. Reno tells Billy that Evelyn has kissed her, and she is sure she will be Lady Oakleigh soon, since love moves so quickly these days (&quot;Anything Goes&quot;). Mrs. Harcourt, recognizing her dog&#x27;s hair, angrily pulls off Billy&#x27;s beard and the crew and passengers realize he must be the wanted man. As Snake Eyes Johnson, Billy is an instant celebrity.

====Act II====
Billy is honored by both crew and passengers as &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot;. He tells the Captain that Moon (who is still disguised as a minister) is helping him reform from his wicked ways. Moon is asked to lead a revival in the ship&#x27;s lounge. The passengers confess their sins to the &quot;Reverend&quot;, and Lord Evelyn admits to a one-night stand with a young Chinese woman, Plum Blossom. Hope is not impressed with Billy&#x27;s charade, and to please her, he confesses to everyone that he is not really Snake Eyes Johnson. Moon attempts to compensate by revealing that he is not a minister; he is Public Enemy Number Thirteen. The captain sends them both to the brig. Reno restores the mood of the Revival (&quot;Blow, Gabriel Blow&quot;).

Moon tries to cheer Billy up (&quot;Be Like the Bluebird&quot;). Billy doubts he will ever see Hope again; he and Moon cannot leave their cell until they return to America. Their card-playing Chinese cellmates Ching and Ling, imprisoned for conning all the third class passengers out of their money, will be put ashore in England. Moon and Billy challenge them to a game of strip poker, win their clothes, and disguise themselves again.

Billy, Moon, and Reno show up at the Oakleigh estate in Chinese garb. Billy and Moon tell Oakleigh&#x27;s uncle that they are the parents of &quot;Plum Blossom&quot; and threaten to publicize Evelyn&#x27;s indiscretion if he does not marry her. Oakleigh offers to buy them off and Moon gleefully accepts the cash, much to Billy and Reno&#x27;s chagrin.

Billy and Reno find Hope and Evelyn, who are both unhappy with the prospect of their matrimony. Hope declares that she desperately wants to marry Billy (&quot;The Gypsy in Me&quot;). Billy spots Whitney and finally learns that Evelyn and Hope&#x27;s planned marriage is really an awkward business merger. Billy realises that Oakleigh is manipulating them all; Hope&#x27;s company is really worth millions and Billy informs Whitney of that fact. Whitney offers to buy the firm from Hope at an exorbitant price, and she accepts. The marriage is called off since a merger is now impossible. Billy and Hope get married, as do Reno and Evelyn. A cable from the U.S. government fixes Billy&#x27;s passport problems and declares Moon &quot;harmless&quot;. Moon indignantly pockets Oakleigh&#x27;s check and refuses to return it.

===Current Version (1987, with minor changes in 2011)===

====Act I====

Young Wall Street broker Billy Crocker helps his boss Elisha J. Whitney prepare for his trip to London. Eli tells Billy the next morning he&#x27;s to make a huge sale of a sinking asset. Billy then runs into his friend; evangelist turned night club singer Reno Sweeney who is leaving on the same ship to London. Reno tries to convince Billy to join her, but he refuses and she laments her unrequited love for him (&quot;I Get A Kick Out Of You&quot;). Billy then reveals to Reno he&#x27;s fallen in love with someone else and she berates him, believing he led her on before sadly reaffirming her feelings for him after he leaves (&quot;I Get A Kick Out Of You - Reprise&quot;).

The next morning the crew of the SS &quot;American&quot; prepare to set sail (&quot;There&#x27;s No Cure Like Travel&quot;) as Reno and the other passengers board. Amongst them is debutante Hope Harcourt, the subject of Billy&#x27;s infatuation. She is joined by her wealthy English fiancé Lord Evelyn Oakleigh and her mother Evangeline, who has set her daughter up to be married in order to solve their family&#x27;s recent financial struggles. Billy comes aboard to give Eli his passport and spots Hope. Upon hearing that she&#x27;s to be wed, he stays on the ship in order to pursue her. Also sneaking on to the &quot;American&quot; is Public Enemy No. 13 Moonface Martin who&#x27;s disguised as a priest. He&#x27;s joined by Erma, the promiscuous girlfriend of Public Enemy #1 Snake Eyes Johnson, who is nowhere to be found. Billy inadvertently helps Moonface evade the FBI. Moonface returns the favor by giving Billy Snake Eyes&#x27; ticket as the ship leaves the dock (&quot;Bon Voyage&quot;).

Later that night, Billy bumps into an apologetic Reno who encourages him to go after his real love. When Billy starts to express insecurities about being with Hope, Reno builds up his confidence while playfully putting herself down, and he returns the favor (&quot;You&#x27;re The Top&quot;). Billy then scares off a seasick Evelyn so he can court Hope away from him (&quot;So Easy To Love&quot;). Though she returns Billy&#x27;s feeling, Hope insists on maintaining her duty and marrying Evelyn. Once alone though, she repeats his romantic words (&quot;So Easy To Love - Reprise&quot;).

Eli drunkenly sings about his excitement for the trip, reminisces on his days in Yale, and unsuccessfully invites Hope&#x27;s mom Evangeline to spend the night with him (&quot;The Crew Song&quot;). In the next room over, Moonface and Erma are visited by Billy, who hides when the ship&#x27;s captain comes in and reveals that Billy is believed to be Snake Eyes Johnson. The next morning a quartet of sailors sing about the joy of seeing women as they come ashore (&quot;There&#x27;ll Always Be a Lady Fair&quot;) while Erma steals another seaman&#x27;s clothes to disguise Billy from the crew and his boss. Reno then encounters her old friend Moonface, shortly after which Evelyn approaches her and reveals himself to be a huge fan. Evelyn invites Reno for tea in his room, which Moonface convinces her to accept so she can seduce Evelyn, which they&#x27;ll use to blackmail him and break up his engagement. Reno agrees to his plan and they sing about what great friends they are, only to descend into bickering (&quot;Friendship&quot;).

The attempted extortion proves to be a failure, with Reno and Evelyn instead finding themselves utterly charmed by each other. Billy and Moonface then try to frame Evelyn as a mad man to Evangeline only for Hope to step in and expose Billy&#x27;s identity. The crew pursues him while Reno reprimands Hope for ignoring her own happiness and chasing away the man she loves. Hope breaks into tears before Billy returns to serenade her, with her now reciprocating (&quot;It&#x27;s Delovely&quot;). However, the next morning Hope struggles to tell her mother of her real love and shortly afterwards Billy is apprehended by the crew. The captain then releases Billy to satisfy the celebrity crazed passengers, and he basks in the fame of being a gangster whilst Moonface blows his cover to do the same. An upset Hope walks away whilst an onlooking Reno leads the ship in a tap dance and remarks that nowadays, &quot;Anything Goes&quot;.

====Act II====

The whole ship has gathered to honor Billy as &quot;Public Enemy No. 1&quot;. After unsuccessfully trying to get him and Hope back together, Reno begins her performance for that night. She starts out with a sermon asking passengers to confess their sins. In his confession, Evelyn tells everyone of the time he had casual sex with a Chinese woman named Plum Blossom. Reno then performs a lively gospel number with everyone else joining in (&quot;Blow, Gabriel, Blow&quot;) at which point she declares &quot;they&#x27;ve seen the light&quot;. The passengers then convince Billy to make a confession, and he reveals that he&#x27;s not Snake Eyes Johnson and apologizes to Hope. Moonface tries and fails to defend him, and both are thrown in the brig. Reacting to this development, Evangeline moves the wedding up to the next morning on the ship and a heartbroken Hope realizes her chance at true love is over (&quot;Goodbye Little Dream, Goodbye&quot;).

In the brig, Moonface attempts to cheer up a depressed Billy by telling him to &quot;Be Like The Bluebird&quot;. Erma visits them to deliver a letter from Hope where she confesses her feelings for Billy, at which point they both — on separate parts of the ship — express their love (&quot;All Through The Night&quot;). Reno then meets Evelyn on the deck where he admits that he doesn&#x27;t love Hope and hints that he&#x27;s fallen for her instead. Despite this, his sense of honor and family code causes him to keep the engagement. Reno then notes that his one night stand in China contradicts this. At her prodding, Evelyn reveals his Romani ancestry and the wild side he&#x27;d previously tried to keep hidden. He shows his true feelings for her, she requites them, and they have a passionate tango dance (&quot;Gypsy In Me&quot;).

Two Chinese passengers are thrown into the brig with Billy and Moonface for gambling. Reno then comes to tell her friends that she and Evelyn have fallen in love with each other. Knowing that the Chinese passengers will be let out in an hour, the three then steal their clothes to get Billy and Moonface out in time to stop the wedding. On the deck, Erma is proposed to by all the sailors she&#x27;s slept with during the cruise. She warns them if they start a relationship, she won&#x27;t be easily pleased (&quot;Buddy Beware&quot;).

The wedding starts but is interrupted when Reno, Billy, and Moonface run in wearing Chinese garb. They claim that Reno is Plum Blossom, who is actually a Chinese princess that Evelyn dishonored when he slept with her. The ruse is almost ruined when Moonface accepts Eli&#x27;s bribe to leave, but Hope intervenes by saying the only way for Evelyn to right his wrong is if he offers her to Plum Blossom&#x27;s relative. Evelyn goes along with this, giving Hope away to Billy, and then proposing to Reno who accepts as she unmasks herself. Evangeline is distraught over the idea of becoming poor, but Eli proposes to her, bragging that his recent Wall Street sale has made him rich. Their mutual delight is cut short when Billy unveils his identity and informs his boss that he never made the sale. Evangeline prepares to leave Eli immediately but before she can do so, a wire comes in saying that the stock that wasn&#x27;t sold has gone through the roof making him even richer than he imagined. All three couples now together sing to each other as they&#x27;re married and the whole ship celebrates (&quot;Finale&quot;).

==Notable productions==
===Broadway===
The official Broadway debut was at the Alvin Theatre on November 21, 1934. It ran for 420 performances, becoming the fourth longest-running musical of the 1930s, despite the impact of the Great Depression on Broadway patrons&#x27; disposable income. The opening production was directed by Howard Lindsay with choreography by Robert Alton and sets by Donald Oenslager. Today, the show remains a frequently-revived favorite.

===West End===
Charles B. Cochran, a British theatrical manager, had bought the London performance rights during the show&#x27;s Boston run, and he produced it at the West End&#x27;s Palace Theatre. The musical opened on June 14, 1935, and ran for 261 performances. The cast included Jeanne Aubert as Reno Sweeney (the name changed to Reno La Grange, to suit Aubert&#x27;s French background), Jack Whiting as Billy Crocker, and Sydney Howard as Moonface Martin. P. G. Wodehouse was engaged to replace the specifically American references in the book and lyrics with references more appropriate to an English audience.

=== 1962 Off-Broadway revival to 1987 Broadway revival ===
The production was revived in an Off-Broadway production in 1962, opening on May 15, 1962, at the Orpheum Theatre. It was directed by Lawrence Kasha with a cast that included Hal Linden as Billy Crocker, Kenneth Mars as Sir Evelyn, and Eileen Rodgers as Reno Sweeney. For this revival, the script was revised to incorporate several of the changes from the movie versions. Most changes revolved around the previously minor character Bonnie. This revision was also the first stage version of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; to incorporate several songs from other Porter shows: &quot;Take Me Back to Manhattan&quot; from &quot;The New Yorkers&quot;, 1930, &quot;It&#x27;s De-Lovely&quot; from &quot;Red, Hot and Blue&quot;, 1934, &quot;Friendship&quot; from &quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot;, 1939, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Misbehave&quot; from &quot;Paris&quot;, 1928.

For the 1987 Broadway revival, John Weidman and Timothy Crouse (Russel&#x27;s son) updated the book and re-ordered the musical numbers, using Cole Porter songs from other Porter shows, a practice which the composer often engaged in. This revival was rescored for a 16-piece swing band playing on stage, in the style of early Benny Goodman. This production opened at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, in Lincoln Center, on October 19, 1987, and ran for 784 performances. Directed by Jerry Zaks and choreographed by Michael Smuin, it starred Patti LuPone as Reno Sweeney, Howard McGillin as Billy, Bill McCutcheon as Moonface, and Anthony Heald as Lord Evelyn; Leslie Uggams and Linda Hart were replacement Renos. It was nominated for ten Tony Awards (including nominations for McGillin, LuPone, McCutcheon, and Heald), winning for Best Revival of a Musical, Best Featured Actor (McCutcheon), and Best Choreography. The production also won the Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Revival of a Musical and Outstanding Actress (for LuPone).

===1989 West End revival and Australia===

Elaine Paige, a British actress and singer, heard of the success of the 1987 Broadway production and made sure to attend a performance. After seeing the production herself, she was determined to bring it to London. To secure a place in the show&#x27;s cast, Paige decided it was best she co-produced the show with her then-partner, lyricist Tim Rice. The London production opened in July 1989 at the Prince Edward Theatre. Paige starred as Reno Sweeney (she was replaced later in the run by Louise Gold). The original cast also starred Howard McGillin as Billy Crocker (who was replaced later in the show&#x27;s run by John Barrowman), Bernard Cribbins as Moonface, and Kathryn Evans as Erma. The other principals included Ursula Smith, Martin Turner, and Ashleigh Sendin.

Jerry Zaks again directed the production, with scenic and costume design by Tony Walton, lighting by Paul Gallo, and sound by Tony Meola. The musical director was John Owen Edwards and the choreographer Michael Smuin.

The show transferred to Australia the same year and played in both Sydney and Melbourne, starring Geraldine Turner as Reno Sweeney, Peter Whitford as Moonface, Simon Burke as Billy Crocker, Marina Prior as Hope Harcourt, and Maggie Kirkpatrick as Evangeline Harcourt.

===2002–2003 Concert, London, and West End revivals===
In April 2002, a one-night-only concert performance of the show was performed at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. Patti LuPone played Reno with Howard McGillin as Billy and Boyd Gaines as Lord Evelyn Oakleigh. LuPone and Gaines would later star together in the 2008 Broadway revival of &quot;Gypsy&quot;. The performance was directed and choreographed by Robert Longbottom with music supervision by David Chase and designs by Tony Walton.

The National Theatre revived the musical, which opened at the Olivier Theatre on December 18, 2002, and closed on March 22, 2003. The production then transferred to the West End at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, running from September 26, 2003 (in previews), through August 28, 2004. Directed by Trevor Nunn, it starred Sally Ann Triplett, John Barrowman, and Yao Chin (who is now a TV reporter). A cast recording of this production is available.

===2011 Broadway revival===
A revival of the 1987 Broadway rewrite opened on April 7, 2011, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, produced by the Roundabout Theatre Company. Previews began on March 10, 2011. This production was directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall with musical supervision by Rob Fisher, dance arrangements by David Chase, and designs by Derek McLane, Martin Pakledinaz, and Peter Kaczorowski. This revival retained much of the 1987 orchestrations by Michael Gibson with some additions from arranger Bill Elliott.

The show&#x27;s opening night cast featured Sutton Foster as Reno Sweeney, Joel Grey as Moonface Martin, Laura Osnes as Hope Harcourt, Jessica Walter as Evangeline Harcourt, Colin Donnell as Billy Crocker, Adam Godley as Sir Evelyn Oakleigh, John McMartin as Elisha Whitney, Jessica Stone as Erma, Robert Creighton as Purser, Andrew Cao as Luke, Raymond J. Lee as John, and Walter Charles as the Captain.

The revival won the Drama Desk Awards and Tony Awards for Best Revival and Best Choreography, and Foster won the Drama Desk and Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Musical.

The production was originally scheduled to run through July 31, 2011, and was initially extended to April 29, 2012. It was extended two more times before closing on July 8, 2012, after 521 regular performances and 32 previews.

=== 2021 London revival and tour ===
A revival directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, based on the 2011 Broadway production, opened for a limited season at the Barbican Theatre in London on August 4, 2021. The production repurposed the previous Broadway set designs by Derek McLane, sound design by Simon Baker, lighting design by Neil Austin and musical direction/supervision by Stephen Ridley. Previews began on July 23 and, following two extensions, the show closed on November 6, 2021.

Originally set to star Megan Mullally until she withdrew due to injury, Sutton Foster took over as Reno Sweeney in her London theatre debut. It also starred Robert Lindsay as Moonface Martin, Gary Wilmot as Eli Whitney and Felicity Kendal as Mrs. Harcourt. Foster and Kendal departed the production in October, and were replaced by Rachel York and Haydn Gwynne, respectively. The production received rave critical reviews, broke box office records at the Barbican, and received 9 Olivier Award nominations including Best Musical Revival the following year. During its run, the show was recorded for cinema distribution. This version was eventually shown on the &quot;Great Performances&quot; US television series on May 13, 2022.

After concluding its run at the Barbican, a UK and Ireland tour from April 2022 and a limited return to the Barbican from July 2022 were announced.

===Regional revivals===
A high-profile co-production between Gateway Playhouse (Bellport, New York) and Ogunquit Playhouse starred Andrea McArdle as Reno Sweeney and Sally Struthers as Mrs. Harcourt. The production, which ran in May to June 4, 2016, featured the Derek McLane sets and Martin Pakledinaz costumes that were created for the 2011 Broadway revival, which was produced by the Roundabout Theatre Company.

==Film versions==
In 1936, Paramount Pictures turned &quot;Anything Goes&quot; into a movie musical. It starred Ethel Merman (the original Reno), with Bing Crosby in the role of Billy Crocker. Other cast members included Ida Lupino, Charles Ruggles, Arthur Treacher, and Grace Bradley. The director was Lewis Milestone. Among those contributing new songs were Hoagy Carmichael, Richard A. Whiting, Leo Robin, and Friedrich Hollaender.

The book was drastically rewritten for a second film version, also by Paramount, released in 1956. This movie again starred Crosby (whose character was renamed), and Donald O&#x27;Connor. The female leads were Zizi Jeanmaire and Mitzi Gaynor. The script departed significantly from the original story and was written by Sidney Sheldon. The lesser-known Porter songs were cut, and new songs, written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn, were substituted.

A third version, directed by Ross MacGibbon and Kathleen Marshall, filmed live on stage during a performance of the 2021 London revival, follows the 2011 Broadway revival. This version was eventually shown on US television on PBS&#x27; &quot;Great Performances&quot; on May 13, 2022.

==Television versions==
In 1950, the premiere episode of &quot;Musical Comedy Time&quot; featured a televised version of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; starring Martha Raye.
In 1954, Ethel Merman, at the age of forty-six, reprised her role as Reno in a specially adapted live television version of the musical, co-starring Frank Sinatra as the hero, now renamed Harry Dane; Merman&#x27;s good friend Bert Lahr (who had co-starred with her on Broadway in &quot;DuBarry Was a Lady&quot;) as Moonface Martin; and Sheree North. This version was broadcast live on February 28, 1954, as an episode of &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, and has been preserved on kinescope. It used five of the original songs plus several other Porter numbers and retained the shipboard setting, but it had a somewhat different plot. It has been reported that Merman and Sinatra did not get along well. This version was released on DVD in 2011.

In 1962, a Norwegian language television movie adaptation starring Per Asplin and Anita Thallaug aired as part of the NRK series &quot;&quot;.

<text>Philipp Eduard Anton von Lenard (; ; 7 June 1862 – 20 May 1947) was a Hungarian-German physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905 &quot;for his work on cathode rays&quot; and the discovery of many of their properties. One of his most important contributions was the experimental realization of the photoelectric effect. He discovered that the energy (speed) of the electrons ejected from a cathode depends only on the frequency, and not the intensity, of the incident light.

Lenard was a nationalist and anti-Semite; as an active proponent of the Nazi ideology, he supported Adolf Hitler in the 1920s and was an important role model for the &quot;&quot; movement during the Nazi period. Notably, he labeled Albert Einstein&#x27;s contributions to science as &quot;Jewish physics&quot;.

== Early life and work ==
Philipp Lenard was born in Pressburg (&quot;Pozsony&quot;, today&#x27;s Bratislava), on 7 June 1862 in the Kingdom of Hungary. The Lenard family had originally come from Tyrol in the 17th century, while his mother&#x27;s family originated from Baden; both parents were German-speaking. His father, Philipp von Lenard (1812–1896), was a wine-merchant in Pressburg. His mother was Antonie Baumann (1831–1865). Among his mostly Germanic ancestors he also had Magyar ones. The young Lenard studied at the &quot;Pozsonyi Királyi Katolikus Főgymnasium&quot; (today Gamča), and as he records in his autobiography, this made a big impression on him (especially the personality of his teacher, Virgil Klatt). In 1880, he studied physics and chemistry in Vienna and in Budapest.

In 1882, Lenard left Budapest and returned to Pressburg, but in 1883, he moved to Heidelberg after his tender for an assistant&#x27;s position in the University of Budapest was refused. In Heidelberg, he studied under the illustrious Robert Bunsen, interrupted by one semester in Berlin with Hermann von Helmholtz. He also studied under Georg Hermann Quincke and he obtained a doctoral degree in 1886. In 1887, he worked again in Budapest under Loránd Eötvös as a demonstrator. After posts at Aachen, Bonn, Breslau, Heidelberg (1896–1898), and Kiel (1898–1907), he returned finally to the University of Heidelberg in 1907 as the head of the Philipp Lenard Institute. Lenard became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1905 and of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1907. His early work included studies of phosphorescence and luminescence and the conductivity of flames.

== Contributions to physics ==
=== Photoelectric investigations ===

As a physicist, Lenard&#x27;s major contributions were in the study of cathode rays, which he began in 1888. Prior to his work, cathode rays were produced in primitive, partially evacuated glass tubes that had metallic electrodes in them, across which a high voltage could be placed. Cathode rays were difficult to study using this arrangement, because they were inside sealed glass tubes, difficult to access, and because the rays were in the presence of air molecules. Lenard overcame these problems by devising a method of making small metallic windows in the glass that were thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure differences, but thin enough to allow passage of the rays. Having made a window for the rays, he could pass them out into the laboratory, or, alternatively, into another chamber that was completely evacuated. These windows have come to be known as &quot;Lenard windows&quot;. He was able to conveniently detect the rays and measure their intensity by means of paper sheets coated with phosphorescent and materials. In particular, he came to use pentadecylparatolylketone, which was very effective as a cathode ray detector but, unfortunately for Lenard, not fluorescent in X-rays. When Roentgen set out to reproduce Lenard&#x27;s results he was forced to use barium platinocyanide instead because Lenard had purchased all the available pentadecylparatolylketone. The alternative was sensitive to both UV and X-rays allowing Roentgen to discover X-rays.

Lenard observed that the absorption of cathode rays was, to first order, proportional to the density of the material they were made to pass through. This appeared to contradict the idea that they were some sort of electromagnetic radiation. He also showed that the rays could pass through some inches of air of a normal density, and appeared to be scattered by it, implying that they must be particles that were even smaller than the molecules in air. He confirmed some of J. J. Thomson&#x27;s work, which eventually arrived at the understanding that cathode rays were streams of negatively charged energetic particles. He called them quanta of electricity or for short quanta, after Helmholtz, while Thomson proposed the name corpuscles, but eventually electrons became the everyday term. In conjunction with his and other earlier experiments on the absorption of the rays in metals, the general realization that electrons were constituent parts of the atom enabled Lenard to claim correctly that for the most part atoms consist of empty space. He proposed that every atom consists of empty space and electrically neutral corpuscules called &quot;dynamids&quot;, each consisting of an electron and an equal positive charge.

As a result of his Crookes tube investigations, he showed that the rays produced by irradiating metals in a vacuum with ultraviolet light were similar in many respects to cathode rays. His most important observation was that the energy of the rays in the photoelectric effect was independent of the light intensity.

These latter observations were explained by Albert Einstein as a quantum effect. This theory predicted that the plot of the cathode ray energy versus the frequency would be a straight line with a slope equal to the Planck constant, &quot;h&quot;. This was shown to be the case some years later. The photo-electric quantum theory was the work cited when Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Suspicious of the general adulation of Einstein, Lenard became a prominent skeptic of relativity and of Einstein&#x27;s theories generally; he did not, however, dispute Einstein&#x27;s explanation of the photoelectric effect. Lenard grew extremely resentful of the credit accorded to Wilhelm Röntgen, who received the first Nobel Prize in physics in 1901, for the discovery of the X-ray, despite the fact that Röntgen was German and a non-Jew. Lenard wrote that he, not Roentgen, was the &quot;mother of the X-rays&quot;, since he had invented the apparatus used to produce them. Lenard likened Röntgen&#x27;s role to that of a &quot;midwife&quot; who merely assists with the birth.

Lenard received the 1905 Nobel Prize for Physics in recognition of this work.

=== Meteorological contributions ===

Lenard was the first person to study what has been termed the &quot;Lenard effect&quot; in 1892. This is the separation of electric charges accompanying the aerodynamic breakup of water drops. It is also known as spray electrification or the waterfall effect.

He conducted studies on the size and shape distributions of raindrops and constructed a novel wind tunnel in which water droplets of various sizes could be held stationary for a few seconds. He was the first to recognize that large raindrops are not tear-shaped, but are rather shaped something like a hamburger bun.

== &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; ==

Lenard is remembered today as a strong German nationalist who despised &quot;English physics&quot;, which he considered to have stolen its ideas from Germany. 
Lenard and fellow experimental physicist Johannes Stark were increasingly sidelined and ignored in the 1920&#x27;s due to their rejection of the theory of relativity and of quantum mechanics.
During the Nazi regime, he was the outspoken proponent of the idea that Germany should rely on &quot;&quot; and ignore what he considered the fallacious and deliberately misleading ideas of &quot;Jewish physics&quot;, by which he meant chiefly the theories of Albert Einstein, including &quot;the Jewish fraud&quot; of relativity (see also criticism of the theory of relativity). Lenard became Chief of Aryan Physics under the Nazis.
In his forward to his four volume science textbook he argued that like everything that man creates, science is determined by race.

Lenard&#x27;s book, &quot;Great Men in Science, A History of Scientific Progress&quot;, first published in English in 1933, claimed these men were all &quot;Aryan scientists&quot;. The individual scientists selected for inclusion by Lenard do not include Einstein or Marie Curie, nor any other twentieth-century scientist. The publisher included what now appears to be a remarkable understatement on page xix of the 1954 English edition: &quot;While Professor Lenard&#x27;s studies of the men of science who preceded him showed not only profound knowledge but also admirable balance, when it came to men of his own time he was apt to let his own strong views on contemporary matters sway his judgment. In his lifetime he would not consent to certain modifications that were proposed in the last study of the series&quot;.

== Later life ==
Lenard retired from Heidelberg University as professor of theoretical physics in 1931. He achieved emeritus status there, but he was expelled from his post by Allied occupation forces in 1945 when he was 83. The Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg had been named the Philipp Lenard Schule from 1927 until 1945. As part of the elimination of Nazi street names and monuments it was renamed in September 1945 by order of the military government. Lenard died in 1947 in Messelhausen, Germany.

<text>Angelo Raffaele Sodano, (23 November 1927 – 27 May 2022) was an Italian Catholic prelate and from 1991 onward a cardinal. He was the Dean of the College of Cardinals from 2005 to 2019 and Cardinal Secretary of State from 1991 to 2006; Sodano was the first person since 1828 to serve simultaneously as Dean and Secretary of State.

On 22 June 2006, Pope Benedict XVI accepted Sodano&#x27;s resignation as Secretary of State, effective on 15 September 2006. He had served in the diplomatic corps of the Holy See since 1959, including a decade as nuncio to Chile from 1978 to 1988. 

On 21 December 2019, it was reported that Sodano shielded sexually abusive clergy in the Legion of Christ. On the same day, Pope Francis accepted Sodano&#x27;s resignation as Dean of the College of Cardinals.

==Early life==
The second of six children, Sodano was born on 23 November 1927 in Isola d&#x27;Asti, Piedmont, to Giovanni and Delfina Sodano. His father (1901–1991) was a Christian Democrat deputy in the Italian Parliament for three terms from 1948 until 1963. After studying philosophy and theology at the seminary of Asti, Sodano was ordained a priest by Bishop Umberto Rossi on 23 September 1950, and then did pastoral work and taught dogmatic theology at the Asti seminary.

Sodano studied in Rome, obtaining a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University and a doctorate in canon law at the Pontifical Lateran University. To prepare for a diplomatic career, he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1959. Upon joining the diplomatic service of the Holy See, he served as secretary in nunciatures in Latin America. In 1968 he was assigned to the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church in the Vatican.

==Apostolic nuncio==
On 30 November 1977, Sodano, who spoke English, German, Spanish, French, and Italian, was appointed titular archbishop of Nova Caesaris and apostolic nuncio to Chile, one of the countries where he had served as nunciature secretary. He was consecrated in his native Asti by Cardinal Antonio Samoré on 15 January 1978. He arrived at a difficult moment, with Chile on the brink of war with Argentina over the Beagle Channel and Augusto Pinochet in power. In 1980, together with Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez, he tried without success to get Pinochet to allow the return of certain political exiles, and in 1984 he obtained, at the cost of a dispute between the Holy See and the military government of Chile, safe conduct for four members of the Revolutionary Left Movement, who had sought diplomatic asylum in the nunciature, to leave for Ecuador.

In 1987, when Pope John Paul II visited Chile, Sodano arranged for him to meet in the nunciature the leaders of the opposition to the Pinochet government. The following year, the Pope appointed Sodano Secretary for Relations with States, a post corresponding to that of a foreign minister, and on 1 December 1990 named him Pro-Secretary of State, creating him Cardinal-Priest of S. Maria Nuova on 28 June 1991.

==Secretary of State==
On 29 June 1991, Sodano became Cardinal Secretary of State, succeeding Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, who had retired on 1 December 1990. On 10 January 1994, Pope John Paul II named Sodano Cardinal Bishop of the suburbicarian see of Albano. Sodano retained his relationship to the church of Santa Maria Nuova no longer as titular but &quot;in commendam&quot;, that is, in trust or his custody.

On 27 December 1998, Sodano wrote, at the request of the democratic government of Chile, an official letter to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair stating that &quot;the Chilean Government considers it an offense to its territorial sovereignty as a nation the fact of being deprived of the power to judge its citizens&quot; through the detention of Pinochet in Britain. When in 2002 he turned 75, John Paul invited him to stay on as Secretary of State, though this is the customary retirement age for heads of major Vatican departments. On 30 November 2002, exactly twenty-five years after he was first appointed a bishop, he was elected vice-dean of the College of Cardinals, succeeding Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who became dean. In 2003, as the pope&#x27;s legate to the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the election of the Renaissance Pope Julius II, he praised him for his vigorous defense of the Holy See in an age when its temporal role was still critical.

Sodano participated as an elector in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. He was not generally considered a likely candidate himself, though he reportedly received a few votes. During the conclave, because Cardinal Ratzinger, the pope-elect, was the dean, Sodano as the sub-dean exercised the dean&#x27;s duties, asking the pope-elect if he accepted his election and by what name he would be called. At the papal inauguration, Sodano presented Pope Benedict XVI with the Ring of the Fisherman, and he was one of those who made the public profession of obedience to the new pope.

Sodano&#x27;s position as Secretary of State expired upon the death of John Paul II. Benedict XVI reappointed him to the position on 21 April 2005,
even though he was past the customary retirement age. On 30 April Benedict ratified Sodano&#x27;s election to the position of Dean of the College of Cardinals by the suburbicarian cardinal bishops, adding as was customary the suburbicarian see of Ostia to his honorary titles.

On 22 June 2006, Benedict XVI accepted Sodano&#x27;s resignation as Secretary of State, effective 15 September 2006. On 18 September 2012, Sodano was named by Pope Benedict as one of the Synod Fathers of the 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Catholic Synod of Bishops. When Pope Benedict resigned, Sodano as Dean of the College of Cardinals summoned the cardinals for the conclave during the &quot;sede vacante&quot; and was the principal concelebrant of the &quot;Pro eligendo Pontifice&quot; mass on the morning the conclave opened. He was not eligible to participate in the conclave, which elected Pope Francis. At the inauguration of the new pope, Sodano, as Dean of the college, presented the Ring of the Fisherman to Francis.

On 21 December 2019, Pope Francis accepted Sodano&#x27;s resignation as Dean of the College of Cardinals, following the Pope&#x27;s annual Christmas meeting with officials of the Curia which opens with a greeting by the Dean.

==Sex abuse cases==
Former Irish minister for foreign affairs Dermot Ahern revealed in 2018 that Sodano pressured him in 2004 to &quot;indemnify the Catholic Church against legal actions for compensation by clerical child sexual abuse survivors&quot; in Ireland, which Ahern refused.

Jason Berry writes that Sodano, as John Paul II&#x27;s secretary of state, &quot;pressured Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then the head of Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and who would become Pope Benedict, to stop investigations into two notorious sex abuse cases,&quot; the Hans Hermann Groër case and the Marcial Maciel case. In his address as Dean of the College of Cardinals to Pope Benedict XVI at Easter 2010, Sodano told him: &quot;The people of God are with you and do not allow themselves to be impressed by the petty gossip of the moment, by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers.&quot; Victims of clerical sex abuse interpreted the &quot;petty gossip&quot; remark as a highly inappropriate reference to their complaints.

On 8 May 2010, the Austrian Catholic news agency Kathpress published remarks made by Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, in what was supposed to be a private conversation with newspaper editors. The Austrian cardinal criticized Sodano&#x27;s &quot;petty gossip&quot; comment and indicated that Sodano had blocked the actions of then-Cardinal Ratzinger, who was serving as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and was intending to investigate accusations against Schönborn&#x27;s predecessor Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër. Schönborn added: &quot;The days of cover-up are over. For a long while the Church&#x27;s principle of forgiveness was falsely interpreted and was in favour of those responsible and not the victims.&quot;

Sodano is one of many Catholic bishops and cardinals who are accused in an August 2018 letter by former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò of failing to act on reports of sexual misconduct by former cardinal Theodore McCarrick. According to Viganò, his predecessors in the nuncio position attempted to warn the Holy See about McCarrick, but McCarrick was shielded from discipline by a series of secretaries of state, including Sodano.

On 21 December 2019, the Legion of Christ identified 33 of its priests and 71 of its seminarians as sexually abusing 175 children for decades and singled out Sodano as the leader of efforts to cover up the reports of abuse when he was serving as Secretary of State. Sodano was accused of seeking a deal to bury documents detailing abuse. A third of the sex abuse cases that Sodano was accused of covering up involved Legion of Christ founder and notorious predator priest Marcial Maciel. The same day, Pope Francis accepted Sodano&#x27;s resignation as Dean of the College of Cardinals. The Holy See Press Office announcement of his resignation provided no reason for it.

==Death==
Sodano died of complications from COVID-19 and pneumonia on 27 May 2022, at the age of 94. Pope Francis paid tribute to Sodano, &quot;I recall his diligent work alongside so many of my predecessors, who entrusted him with important responsibilities in Vatican diplomacy, up to the delicate office of Secretary of State. In the Roman Curia, he carried out his mission with exemplary dedication. I, too, was able to benefit from his gifts of mind and heart, especially when he exercised the office of Dean of the College of Cardinals. In every assignment, he showed himself to be an ecclesial disciplined man, an amiable pastor, animated by a desire to spread the leaven of the Gospel everywhere.&quot;

By his wishes, Sodano was interred in the crypt of the cathedral in Asti.

<text>Tai-Pan is a 1966 novel written by James Clavell about European and American traders who move into Hong Kong in 1842 following the end of the First Opium War. It is the second book in Clavell&#x27;s &quot;Asian Saga&quot;, and the first to feature the fictional Struan family.

==Plot summary==

The novel begins following the British victory of the first Opium War and the seizure of Hong Kong. Although the island is largely uninhabited and the terrain unfriendly, it has a large natural harbour that both the British government and various trading companies believe will be useful for the import of merchandise to be traded in mainland China, a highly lucrative market.

Although the novel features many characters, it is Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock, former shipmates and the owners of two massive (fictional) trading companies who are the main focal points of the story. Their rocky and often abusive relationship as seamen initiated an intense amount of competitive tension. Throughout the novel, both men seek to destroy each other in matters of business and personal affairs. Struan is referred to throughout the novel as the Tai-pan, indicating his position as head of Struan &amp; Company, the greatest private trading company in nineteenth-century Asia. Clavell translates tai-pan as &quot;Supreme Leader&quot; although &quot;Big Shot&quot; might be more accurate.

In 1805, at the age of seven, Dirk Struan began his nautical adventures as a powder monkey on a king&#x27;s ship at the Battle of Trafalgar and he remains bound to the sea for life. By the end of this year, he found service on the East India Company merchant ship &quot;Vagrant Star&quot; to China. Under the command of Tyler Brock, third mate and future nemesis, Dirk Struan was whipped mercilessly. Dirk Struan vowed to someday destroy Brock. Later, Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock would go on to dominate the opium trade.

In 1812 a fateful night in the Malacca Strait, &quot;Vagrant Star&quot; ran aground on a reef and sank. At the age of fourteen, Struan swam ashore and found his way to Singapore. Later, Dirk Struan discovered that Tyler Brock survived as well.

By 1822, Dirk Struan was a captain-owner of his own ship on the opium run. Tyler Brock was his chief rival. Also this year, Dirk Struan married Ronalda in Scotland, but immediately travelled to Macau.

In 1824, Culum Struan was born. He was the son of Dirk Struan and Ronalda. Shortly after his birth, Ronalda and Culum were sent to Glasgow. Ronalda would never return to China. Also this year, Gordon Chen was born. He was the illegitimate son of Dirk Struan and his mistress, Chen Kai Sung.

In 1826, the British East India Company decided to make an example of Struan and Brock. The Company withdrew their licenses and the two men were financially wiped out. Brock was left with his ship, Struan with nothing. Brock entered a secret agreement with another opium trader. Dirk Struan pilfered a lorcha from pirates in Macau. He became a clandestine opium smuggler for other China traders. He relentlessly confiscated more pirate ships. Using them to make dangerous illicit opium runs up the China coast, he made even greater profits.

In 1834, free trade reform advocates succeeded in ending the monopoly of the British East India Company under the Charter Act 1833. Finally, British trade opened to private entrepreneurs. With the freedom to legally trade, Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock became merchant princes. Their armed fleets expanded and bitter rivalry honed their enmity even keener.

In 1837, Jin-qua arranged for May–May, his favourite granddaughter, to become Dirk Struan&#x27;s mistress. She was secretly assigned the task of teaching &quot;the green-eyed devil&quot; Struan &quot;civilised&quot; (Chinese) ways.

By 1838, Dirk Struan was considered the Tai-pan of all tai-pan. Struan &amp; Company was recognised as the Noble House. Business concerns of the Noble House included smuggling opium from India into China, trading spices and sugar from the Philippines, importing Chinese tea and silk into England, handling cargo papers, cargo insurance, renting of dockyard facilities and warehouse space, trade financing, and other numerous lines of business and trade. The company possessed nineteen intercontinental clipper ships. A close rival, Brock &amp; Sons Trading Company, possessed thirteen. Additionally, Struan &amp; Company possessed hundreds of small ships and lorchas for upriver coastal smuggling.

By 1839, Gordon Chen grew to become a remarkably intelligent and a very skilled businessman. However, he longed for recognition from his biological father, Dirk Struan. To achieve this, he decided to become indispensable to Dirk Struan and the Noble House.

From January to July 1841, events detailed in the novel unfold.

The Noble House was on the brink of financial collapse and about to be destroyed by rival Tyler Brock. In desperation and upon prompting by Mary Sinclair, Dirk Struan turned to Jin Qua. In exchange for a series of favours and promises, Dirk Struan received a loan of &quot;4 million&quot; (approximately £1 million) in silver bullion from the Jin Qua.

The first part of the arrangement, Struan agreed to certain trade concessions. The second part of the arrangement, Struan agreed that a member of the Chen family would forever be comprador of the Noble House. The third part of the arrangement, Struan agreed to sell Jin Qua a sizeable plot of land in Hong Kong with the deed to be recorded in the name of Gordon Chen.

The fourth part of the arrangement, Struan agreed to the &quot;coin debt&quot;. Four bronze coins were split irregularly in half, each coin different from the other three. Four halves were given to Dirk Struan and the other four halves were kept by Jin Qua. Anyone who presented a half-coin to the tai-pan of the Noble House must be granted whatever he asked, whether legal or illegal. All future tai-pan of the Noble House must swear to keep this bargain. This served as repayment for the loan of silver.

Tess Brock and Culum Struan fell in love and married. The couple condemned their fathers&#x27; hatred for each other.

Due to the bargain struck between Dirk Struan and Jin Qua, Gordon Chen managed Jin Qua&#x27;s financial interests in Hong Kong, investing in land and money lending. Gordon Chen seized leadership of the Hong Kong triad. Partly due to assistance from his father and partly due to running protection rackets, Gordon Chen quickly became the wealthiest Chinese man in Hong Kong. Gordon Chen concealed this information from his father. When his status as Dragon Head of the triad was revealed, his position was nearly ruined. Fortunately, facts were dismissed as lies. Although, Dirk Struan was not entirely convinced.

As part of his efforts to protect his father, Gordon Chen arranged the assassination of Gorth Brock and sought a cure for May–May&#x27;s malaria. The first half-coin of Jin Qua was presented to Dirk Struan by the pirate warlord Wu Fang Choi.

On 21 July 1841, Dirk Struan was killed in a typhoon before he can fulfil his oath to destroy Brock. Culum Struan became the second tai-pan of the Noble House. Gordon Chen began placing spies on Struan &amp; Company&#x27;s ships. Gordon Chen raised Duncan and Kate Struan, the children of Dirk Struan and May–May.

The enmity between Struan and Brock is a prominent theme in Clavell&#x27;s &quot;Asian Saga&quot;. Dirk Struan and Tyler Brock left many children, legitimate and illegitimate, who take up their respective fathers&#x27; mantles and continue the battle. Thus begins a vicious cycle which lasts many years.

==Background==
Clavell had written one novel, the autobiographical &quot;King Rat&quot;. He was challenged to write a second book because &quot;that separates the men from the boys&quot;. He said he wanted to write a book which did for Hong Kong what James Michener&#x27;s &quot;Hawaii&quot; did for that state. &quot;The movie sale money for &quot;King Rat&quot; gave me the drop dead money I needed to write &quot;Tai Pan&quot;, said Clavell. (He later said this was $157,000 spread over five years for tax purposes.)

After visiting Hong Kong with Benson Fong in 1962, Clavell returned in 1963 with his family for a year. He said it took him five false starts, 241 days to write a first draft, and 12 weeks to do the second. Clavell originally wanted the novel to span from the establishment of Hong Kong until the present day but when writing it decided to end the novel on the death of the first tai pan. He did so much research it gave him the idea to write a trilogy; in particular he later wrote a novel set in 1963 Hong Kong, &quot;Noble House&quot;.

German Gollob was Clavell&#x27;s editor.

==Reception==
The book was an immediate best-seller and film rights were sold to MGM and Filmways for $500,000. (Although it would take two decades for the film to be made). By 1976 the novel had sold over a million-and-a-half copies in paperback.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; said the book was not as notable as &quot;King Rat&quot; but was &quot;almost an archetype of pure story telling... undoubtedly grand entertainment... hordes of readers will revel in &quot;Tai Pan&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="393693" wikidata="Q3149445" url="?curid=393693" title="Entailment (linguistics)">
<text>Linguistic entailments are entailments which arise in natural language. If a sentence &quot;A&quot; entails a sentence &quot;B&quot;, sentence &quot;A&quot; cannot be true without &quot;B&quot; being true as well. For instance, the English sentence &quot;Pat is a fluffy cat&quot; entails the sentence &quot;Pat is a cat&quot; since one cannot be a fluffy cat without being a cat. On the other hand, this sentence does not entail &quot;Pat chases mice&quot; since it is possible (if unlikely) for a cat to not chase mice.

Entailments arise from the semantics of linguistic expressions. Entailment contrasts with the pragmatic notion of implicature. While implicatures are fallible inferences, entailments are enforced by lexical meanings plus the laws of logic. Entailments also differ from presuppositions, whose truth is taken for granted. The classic example of a presupposition is the existence presupposition which arises from definite descriptions. For example, the sentence &quot;The king of France is bald&quot; presupposes that there is a king of France. Unlike an entailment, presuppositions survive when the sentence is negated. The negation test can be used to determine the difference between entailment and presupposition. For instance, &quot;The king of France is not bald&quot; likewise presupposes that there is a king of France.

<doc id="393701" wikidata="Q311596" url="?curid=393701" title="Fatos Nano">
<text>Fatos Thanas Nano (; born 16 September 1952) is an Albanian socialist politician who served as Prime Minister of Albania in 1991, from 1997 to 1998 and from 2002 to 2005. He was the first leader and founder of the Socialist Party of Albania and a member of the Albanian Parliament from 1991 to 1993 and 1997 to 2009. He reformed the anti-revisionist Marxist-Leninist ideology of the Labor Party of Albania into social democracy for its successor, the Socialist Party. During his leadership, the Socialist Party, as a result of reforms, joined the Socialist International and Party of European Socialists. Nano was a candidate in the 2007 presidential election but did not win. He again tried in the 2012 presidential election, but he did not even qualify as a candidate, because the leaders of parties in Parliament obstructed their respective MPs to elect him as candidate in the elections.

==Personal history==
Fatos Nano was born in Tirana. His parents were Thanas Nano, a former director of Albanian Radio Television, and Maria Nano (née Shuteriqi), a government official, she was from the same family as Dhimitër Shuteriqi. He was the only male child among female siblings in the family. He grew up in Hoxha Tahsim Street in East Tirana, attended and graduated from “Sami Frasheri” High School, reserved for the children of the nomenklatura. In the early years of adolescence, Nano was eager to learn foreign languages and used to play the guitar. In his second year of high school, he founded a rock group of which he was the lead singer; they played the music of the Beatles, strictly forbidden to the general public at the time. He graduated in Political Economy from the University of Tirana in 1974. After graduation in 1978, Nano worked in the management of the metallurgical mills of Elbasan until 1981. From 1981 until 1984, Nano served as an economist at Priska&#x27;s Agricultural Farm in Tirana. In 1984, he was appointed as a researcher of socio-economic problems and reforms of market economies of Eastern Bloc countries in the Institute of Marxist-Leninist Studies in Tirana, where he worked until 1990. When Fatos Nano was working in the Marxist-Leninist Institute, he was under the observation of Nexhmije Hoxha, Enver Hoxha&#x27;s wife. He was singled out for special favor.

===Early political career===
He began his political career in December 1990, where he was first appointed as Secretary General of the Council of Ministers. In January 1991, he was promoted to the position of Deputy Prime Minister, still in the government of Adil Çarçani. The fall of the communist regimes in various Central and Eastern European countries forced President Ramiz Alia to gradually remove the old communist nomenklatura from power and government, so in the end of February 1991, Alia appointed Nano as Prime Minister of the transitional government with the purpose of organizing the first post-communist democratic elections in the country being held that year and to prepare the transition of the country towards liberal democracy and market economy. The Parliamentary Elections were held on 31 March 1991 where the Labour Party of Albania won the majority. Ramiz Alia appointed Nano for the second time as the new Prime Minister. However, his new government did not last longer than the first as one week after a General Strike organized by the independent unions forced him to resign a couple of weeks later. The 10th Congress of the Labor Party was held in June 1991, which took three important decisions; first it changed the name of Labour Party to Socialist Party, then it expelled all the members of the Politburo, and then it elected Nano as the new leader of the Socialist Party on 13 June 1991.

===Imprisonment===
After the Democratic Party of Albania won the parliamentary election of 22 March 1992, the Parliament set up a commission in early 1993 to investigate the activity of Fatos Nano for alleged corruption and abuse with management of humanitarian aid given by the Italian state during the economic crisis that lasted from 1990 until early 1992. This was a sophisticated way to imprison Nano due to his strong opposition to the autocratic signs of President Sali Berisha and due to the inefficiency and inability of the government headed by Aleksander Meksi to accomplish effective economic reforms. Nano was right about this, because the government of the Democratic Party permitted the notorious Ponzi schemes (known as pyramid schemes in Albania) which resulted in the unrest of 1997 where the majority of Albanians lost their savings, instead of effective economical reforms. On 27 July 1993 the Albanian Parliament approved the request of the General Attorney, Alush Dragoshi to take off the legislative immunity for Nano. On 30 July 1993 Nano was arrested in the office of the Prosecutor, and charged with &quot;abuse of duty and the falsification of official documents in connection with Italian aid&quot; following the use of a single vendor which overcharged and delivered foodstuffs which were unfit for consumption. On 3 April 1994, Nano was sentenced to twelve years in prison. A petition signed by 700 thousand people was sent to President Berisha to free Nano from prison. Nano was considered a political prisoner by the Socialist Party of Albania, Amnesty International, Human Right Watch (former Helsinki Watch), Inter-Parliamentary Union, and other groups, so he was let to be the chairman of it. To do his job from the prison, he used his ex-wife, Rexhina Nano, as intermediate to send directives to the party leadership, sometimes verbally, sometimes in written form. After imprisonment, Nano decided that the party should be led by three Deputy Chairmen and one Secretary General to continue the party&#x27;s political battle.

Since the rejection of the revised Albanian Constitution during the 1994 Referendum, the foreign relations between Albania, the European Union and the United States began to deteriorate due to autocratic manners of President Berisha in the matters of the state, but they also were sceptical about the abilities of the leadership of the Socialist Party to govern the country, in case the Socialist Party were to win the Parliamentary Elections of 1996. The foreign diplomats also expressed concern toward the neutral stance the Socialist leadership (except Nano) held about Enver Hoxha and the positive stance toward Marxism-Leninism, which was implemented in the programme and the statute of the party by Servet Pellumbi. They called the socialist leadership (except Nano, who was not affiliated with Labor Party) as &quot;dinosaurs from the old epoch&quot;.

In 1996, Nano wrote a letter the 2nd Congress of the Party (&quot;Keshilli i Pergjithshem Drejtues&quot;), held on July–August 1996, to initiate a &quot;Motion for Debate&quot; to remove from the top positions of party anyone who was affiliated in any way with the Labour Party, because Nano thought that the top positions, i.e. the leadership of the party, should be held by intellectuals, like Rexhep Meidani, Pandeli Majko, Kastriot Islami, etc. This was an imperative because it was part of the ongoing process to reform the party in order to join the Socialist International and the Party of European Socialists. The &quot;Motion for Debate&quot;, requested by Nano, also required, to implement the recommendations made by State Department, European Parliament and European Council, for the solution of the political and institutional crisis, as official stance of the Socialist Party, also to propose the Congress to remove Marxist and statist concepts from the party&#x27;s statute and programme, also to deny Vladimir Lenin and Comintern and rehabilitate Karl Kautsky and Second Internationale. The motion was supported by the majority of the socialist members and also by the civil society, and was approved as a consequence by the congress.

In 1997, the collapse of Ponzi schemes marked the beginning of an armed popular revolt against President Berisha, who was forced to resign in July 1997. Berisha called untimely parliamentary elections on 29 June and he decreed a general amnesty to all prisoners in March 1997; Nano too was released from prison. Nano was found innocent by a court in Tirana for his alleged abuse of power and corruption in 1999.

===Second and third premierships===

The parliamentary elections of 29 June 1997 were an overwhelming victory for the Socialist Party of Albania. Nano was appointed prime minister by President Rexhep Meidani. The goal of Nano and the socialist government was to rebuild the ruined country, strengthen its economy and reconcile its people divided by political beliefs, but this was almost impossible with the destructive opposition led by former President Berisha. A coup d&#x27;état was attempted on 14 September 1998 by the leadership and the radical followers of the Democratic Party of Albania during the funeral of Azem Hajdari with the goal of taking power by force and murdering Nano. To avoid his murder by the angry mob, Nano decided to flee to the government residence in Pogradec. In the 1990s, Greece preferred and assisted Fatos Nano as Albanian leader due to him being Orthodox over Sali Berisha, a Muslim, as Nano was seen as being friendlier to Greek interests. The government of Fatos Nano was viewed by Turkey as having a pro-Greek orientation and expressed some dissatisfaction though during that time still maintained close military relations with Albania in rebuilding its armed forces and a military base. During 1998 Albania&#x27;s &quot;Organisation of Islamic Cooperation&quot; (OIC) membership was suspended and temporarily withdrawn by prime-minister Fatos Nano who viewed it as inhibiting Albania&#x27;s European aspirations. On 28 September 1998 Nano chose to resign and retired from political life.

After the Socialist Party won for the second time, in the parliamentary elections on 24 June 2001, Nano returned to politics again after 2 years of inactivity by starting the movement called Catharsis, with the goal to cripple the agreement between Rama and Meta to share the political power between them for the next 10 years.

In early 2002, Nano unsuccessfully tried to run for President of Albania, but on 25 July 2002 he was appointed by newly elected president Alfred Moisiu as prime minister for the third time. Just days after retaking office in August 2002, Nano came under attack by leading Italian weekly &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot;, which accused him of having ties to international organized-crime groups, and having been involved in a cigarette-smuggling ring with Naples-based mobsters. Nano sued the magazine in a court in Rome which ruled in favor of Nano. The court found the article to contain untrue information and speculations with the purpose of harming Nano during his term in office. The news magazine was ordered to pay Nano €3 million euros, and sentenced the magazine&#x27;s director Daniela Hamaoi and the authors of the article Claudio Papayani, Dina Nasecti and Giuseppe Roli with 18 months in jail for groundlessly connecting Nano to the crime and mafia in Albania.

In the winter of 2004, a number of protests with over 20,000 people were organized by the opposition led by Sali Berisha demanding Nano to resign as prime minister which came known as the &quot;Nano Go Away&quot; Movement. In 2004, the civil society group Mjaft! protested in front of Nano&#x27;s office against the alleged import of waste from Italy to Albania.

===Resignation===
On 3 July 2005 the Socialist Party lost the elections and its majority in parliament. Nano resigned as prime minister and also as the chairman of Socialist Party on 1 September 2005. Since then, he retired from public and political life. He rarely appears for interviews in some political talk shows.

===Presidential candidacy===
In early 2007, Nano met with Sali Berisha to counter appeals from the Socialist Party to boycott the 2007 local government elections which would have triggered untimely parliamentary elections. Nano was elected candidate for President in the Presidential Elections of 2007 by the request of 20 Socialist MPs. Most members of the opposition coalition led by the Socialist Party did not support him, however, and choose to boycott this Presidential Election. Nano received only three votes, while Bamir Topi of the Democratic Party won 75 votes. Topi did not receive enough votes to be elected, however. The second round of voting was held on 10 July. However, the parliament still failed to elect a president, with Nano getting five votes and Topi receiving 74. Continued failure to elect a president would have resulted in an early parliamentary election, but on 20 July Topi was elected. In late August, it appeared likely Nano would found a new political party. Nano tried again to run for Presidency in 2012, but he did not even qualify for candidate, because the leaders parties in Parliament obstructed their respective MPs to elect him as candidate.

===New movement inside Socialist Party===
After the election of President of Albania in June 2012, Nano formed a movement called &quot;Nano Movement for the victory of socialist&quot; with the goal of retaking the leadership of the Socialist Party. Nano&#x27;s past unpopularity due to his backroom deals with the equally unpopular former Prime Minister Sali Berisha have tainted his credentials and Edi Rama&#x27;s popular judicial, administrative and economical reforms ensure that the latter maintains his position as prime minister and leader of the Socialist Party in Albania.

==Bibliography==
The early life of Nano is narrated by the only biographical book for him in the Albanian language &quot;Të jetosh kohën&quot;, written by his ex-wife Rexhina Nano and published in early 2008 which is extensively used as reference for the information provided in this article, also by Nano himself in his interview to journalist Blendi Fevziu in Opinion talk show during two episodes aired on TV Klan (Episode 1 and Episode 2).

Nano has a degree in political economy and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Tirana.

He has published three books:
*&quot;Socialimperializmi sovjetik në ekonominë kapitaliste botërore&quot; (1987)
*&quot;Die Sowjetunion: ein kapitalistisches, imperialistisches Land&quot; (1988)
*&quot;Dosja Nano&quot; (1994)

Nano was elected as a member of parliament from the districts of Tirana in 1991, Kuçovë in 1992, Tepelenë in 1997 and 2001, and Sarandë in 2005. In 2012, he was elected Honorary Member by the Socialist Party.

<text>Ahmed Ouyahia (; 2 July 1952) is an Algerian politician who was prime minister of Algeria four times (1995–98, 2004–2006, 2008–2012, 2017–2019). A career diplomat, he also served as Minister of Justice, and he was one of the founders of the Democratic National Rally (RND) as well as the party&#x27;s secretary-general. He is considered by Western observers to be close to the military of Algeria and a member of the &quot;eradicator&quot; faction in the 1990s civil war against Islamist militants. Ouyahia resigned as prime minister in March 2019 following President Bouteflika&#x27;s announcement that he would not seek reelection, and Ouyahia was arrested in June 2019 for crimes related to corruption. He was later convicted and is currently serving 19 years in jail.

==Early life and education==
Ouyahia was born in the village of Bouadnane in Tizi Ouzou Province in the Kabylie region of Algeria on 2 July 1952. Following a primary education starting in Algiers, he followed a secondary education at the Lycee El Idrissi (El Idrissi High School) in Algiers. Ouyahia obtained his diploma of Baccalauréat ès-lettres in 1972.

In 1972, Ahmed Ouyahia joined the entry examination for the &quot;National High Studies School of Administration&quot; of Algiers. Having scored among the top three applicants, along with Ahmed Attaf, Ouyahia joined the National High Studies School of Administration and specialised in diplomacy. He graduated in 1976 and did his military service from 1976 to 1978, at the El Mouradia compound of the Algerian Presidency where he was a member of the press relations team.

==Early career==
In 1979, Ouyahia joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was assigned to the African affairs department. In 1980 he was named as an advisor for foreign affairs to the Ambassador of Algeria in Ivory Coast, where he served until 1982. In 1982 he was assigned as a foreign affairs advisor to the head of the Permanent Mission of Algeria at the United Nations headquarters in New York. In 1988 Ouyahia became the general director of the African department of the foreign affairs ministry. From 1988 to 1989 Ouyahia was co-representative to the United Nations Security Council. He was an advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1991.

He led the African department until 1991 when he was named as Ambassador to Mali; he served in the latter post from 1992 to 1993. There he helped negotiate a 1992 peace deal in the Malian Tuareg rebellion between the warring Malian government of Alpha Oumar Konaré and the Azawad Tuareg movement: the short lived &quot;Pacte National&quot; treaty. In August 1993, Ouyahia was called back to Algiers to serve in the government of Redha Malek as Undersecretary of State for African and Arab Affairs, Secretary of State for Cooperation and Maghreb Affairs.

In April 1994, he was nominated as the cabinet director of President Liamine Zeroual, in which post he was in charge of political affairs such as the negotiations with the leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front party (FIS) and the preparations for the 1995 presidential election, which the president won in November 1995. His role in as a member of the so-called &quot;eradicator&quot; faction, advocating all out war against the insurgency during the Algerian Civil War that killed more than 150,000 on both sides, earned him criticism from some Western human rights groups. He is particularly associated with the creation in the late 1990s of the GLD citizen militias (&quot;Legitimate Defence Groups&quot;, &quot;Groupes de légitime défense&quot;).

==First and second premierships==
In December 1995, Ouyahia was nominated as Prime Minister and held that position until December 1998, when he resigned following the election of Abdelaziz Bouteflika as president. The economic condition of Algeria in the late 1990s, as well as a wave of public sector strikes, contributed to his increasing unpopularity as Prime Minister and his December 1998 resignation. As well, opposition parliamentarians accused Ouyahia of rigging the 1997 elections.

In 2000, Ouyahia was elected as Secretary General of the National Rally for Democracy (RND), which he had earlier helped to found. He resigned from the post on 5 January 2013.
Ouyahia served as the Minister of State for Justice from 1999 to 2002 in Bouteflika&#x27;s first government. During this time Ouyahia was assigned the task of securing a peace deal in the war between Ethiopia and Eritrea by Bouteflika, who was also the president of Organisation for African Unity in 2000. Ouyahia worked in conjunction with Anthony Lake, National Security Advisor to President Bill Clinton of the United States, and a peace deal was secured and signed in Algiers in December 2000.

A strong defender of the government, in February 2001, Ouyahia proposed new laws as justice minister which would have imposed a three-year prison term for authors of articles or drawings deemed &quot;defamatory&quot; to political leaders.

In June 2002, following the defeat of the RND in the 2002 parliamentary election, Ouyahia resigned and was nominated in the next government as Minister of State and Special Representative of the President, an honorary position entailing no governing power. In August 2004, Ouyahia was nominated as prime minister for a second time, following a political crisis between President Bouteflika and Prime Minister Ali Benflis, who was dismissed. Ouyahia served in the post for three years, until his resignation on 24 May 2006 amidst political arguments between Ouyahia&#x27;s political party and Bouteflika&#x27;s political party, the FLN.

===Economic troubles===

Starting on 14 October 2004 and lasting through 10 November, the National Council of Secondary and Technical Education Professors (CNAPEST) and the Secondary School Council of Algiers (CLA) went on strike over low wages. education minister Boubekeur Benbouzid, backed by prime minister Ahmed Ouyahia, refused to meet with representatives of either union because they were not officially recognized. Instead, the Government ordered the suspension of more than 300 teachers and threatened further sanctions. only after the officially recognized UGTA affiliate National Federation of Education Workers (FNTE) joined the strike did the agree to raise wages.

The domestic press again asserted that his May 2006 resignation was due to public unpopularity after his opposition to public sector strikes, his opposition to a plan put forward by the rival FNL to raise salaries, and by his support for privatisation of industries.

===Human rights===
In June 2005, Ouyahia called Al-Jazeera television, recently closed indefinitely by his government, &quot;a channel whose sole aim was to tarnish Algeria&#x27;s image.&quot; The channel had broadcast several reports critical of the government the week prior to its closure. From 1993 to 2000, around 4,000 men and women suddenly disappeared in Algeria after being arrested by security forces. Ouyahia has been accused by Western Human rights groups of downplaying the number missing and criticised for claiming that &quot;a large number of the so-called disappeared were in fact in the ranks of terrorist groups.&quot;

===Kabylie mediator===
Ouyahia has been widely credited with mediating a longstanding dispute between protesters leaders from his native Kabylie and the government. In 2005, the government took steps to defuse tensions with the Kabylie and address the concerns of regional leaders. In particular, prime minister Ahmed Ouyahia reached agreement on a number of Kabylie grievances with Arouch leader Belaid Abrika, who had been physically assaulted during a public protest rally and seriously injured in 2004 by members of government security services. The agreement dealt with economic and social concerns and made possible regional elections in November 2005.
 Ouyahia made a number of visits to opposition leaders, and reached out in the Berber-language media for reconciliation.

==Third and fourth premierships==
After some prominent involvement in international diplomatic meetings earlier in 2008, Ouyahia was again named Prime Minister by Bouteflika on 23 June 2008. On this occasion, he pledged &quot;to continue to apply the policy programme of the President of the Republic.&quot; The foreign and domestic press commented on the sometime stormy relations between Ouyahia and Bouteflika, which did not have the same way of his Prime Ministership. Ouyahia&#x27;s term ended on 3 September 2012, and he was replaced by Abdulmalek Sellal.

Bouteflika appointed Ouyahia as Director of the Cabinet of the Presidency, with the rank of Minister of State, in March 2014. Ouyahia was again appointed as prime minister on 15 August 2017, succeeding Abdelmadjid Tebboune; he took office on 16 August.

In October 2018, Ouyahia announced that Algeria would ban the burqa at the workplace. In March 2019, Ouyahia resigned from his position as prime minister following President Bouteflika&#x27;s announcement that he would not seek reelection following protests across the country. In June 2019, Ouyahia was arrested by the country&#x27;s supreme court as part of an anti-corruption investigation. In December 2019, he was sentenced to 15 years in jail.

In March 2020, an appeals court upheld his sentence, to 12 years in prison. On 4 January 2021, Ouyahia was sentenced to seven years in prison, in relation to the corruption case in the tourism sector in Skikda.

<text>This article outlines the grammar of the Dutch language, which shares strong similarities with German grammar and also, to a lesser degree, with English grammar.

==Preliminary considerations==

Vowel length is indicated in Dutch spelling using a combination of double vowels and double consonants. Changes from single to double letters are common when discussing Dutch grammar, but they are entirely predictable once one knows how the spelling rules work. This means that the spelling alternations do not form part of the grammar, and they are not discussed here. For more information, please see Dutch orthography.

==Word order==

Dutch word order is underlyingly SOV (subject–object–verb). There is an additional rule called V2 in main clauses, which moves the finite (inflected for subject) verb into the second position in the sentence. Because of this, sentences with only one verb appear with SVO (subject–verb–object) or VSO (verb–subject–object) order.


However, any other verbs or verbal particles are placed at the end of the clause in accordance with the underlying SOV order, giving an intermediate order of SVOV(V)(V)...

In subordinate clauses, the order is exclusively SOV. In subordinate clauses two word orders are possible for the verb clusters and are referred to as the &quot;red&quot;: , &quot;because I have worked&quot;: as in English, where the auxiliary verb precedes the past participle, and the &quot;green&quot;: , where the past participle precedes the auxiliary verb, &quot;because I worked have&quot;: as in German. In Dutch, the green word order is most used in speech, and the red is the most used in writing, particularly in journalistic texts, but the &quot;green&quot; is also used in writing. Unlike in English, however, adjectives and adverbs must precede the verb: , &quot;that the book is green&quot;. For an explanation of verb clusters of three or more see: V2 word order

In yes–no questions, the verb of the main clause is usually, but not always, placed first instead of second. If the verb comes second, this often implies disbelief, like in English: &quot;The prisoner escaped?&quot; vs. &quot;Did the prisoner escape?&quot;



In imperative sentences, the verb of the main clause is always placed first, although it may be preceded by a noun phrase indicating who is being addressed.


In the following example, the SOV order in the subordinate clause causes the various noun phrases to be separated from the verbs that introduce them, creating a relatively deep &quot;nesting&quot; structure:

Adjectives always come before the noun to which they belong.
: – red apples

In contrast to English, adpositional phrases come in the order time–manner–place, again as in German, so that time modifiers usually come before place modifiers:

==Nouns==
In Dutch, nouns are marked for number in singular and plural. Cases have largely fallen out of use, as have the endings that were used for them. Standard Dutch has three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. However, in large parts of the Netherlands there is no grammatical distinction between what were originally masculine and feminine genders, and there is only a distinction between the resultant common and neuter. Gender is not overtly marked on nouns either, and must be learned for each noun.

===Plural===

The plural is formed by addition of (pronounced or ) or , with the usual spelling changes in the case of the former. Which of the two is used is somewhat unpredictable, although some general rules can be given:

* Single-syllable words, which are common in Dutch, normally use :
** &quot;door&quot; → 
** &quot;boat&quot; → 
** &quot;house&quot; → 
** &quot;thief&quot; → 
* Words ending in a schwa often use , but a sizable number use , particularly if they are older. Some nouns may allow either ending. Nouns that are substantivised forms of adjectives always use .
** &quot;aunt&quot; → 
** &quot;chocolate&quot; → 
** &quot;messenger&quot; → or 
** &quot;oxide&quot; → 
** &quot;great one&quot; → 
* Relatively modern words ending in a long vowel use (with an apostrophe), but if they end in or then no apostrophe is used. Older ones generally use or (with diaeresis).
** &quot;baby&quot; → 
** &quot;café, bar, pub&quot; → 
** &quot;pizza&quot; → 
** &quot;radio&quot; → 
** &quot;roe&quot; → 
** (also ) &quot;drawer&quot; → (but in colloquial usage sometimes also )
* Words ending in unstressed or usually use . If is allowed it tends to be more archaic or poetic.
** &quot;agricultural field&quot; → 
** &quot;apple&quot; → or (archaic) (note: for the derived noun &quot;potato&quot;, the plural is still common, alongside )
** &quot;spoon&quot; → 
** &quot;key&quot; → 
** &quot;father&quot; → or (archaic) 
* Initialisms (words pronounced as letters) follow the rules for whatever the final syllable suggests, usually by adding but occasionally :
** &quot;vehicle inspection&quot; → 
** &quot;CD&quot; → 

====Plurals with vowel change====

A number of common nouns inherited from Old Dutch have a short vowel in the singular but a long vowel in the plural. When short is lengthened in this way, it becomes long .

* &quot;day&quot; → &quot;days&quot;
* &quot;lack, deficiency&quot; → &quot;deficiencies&quot;
* &quot;ship&quot; → &quot;ships&quot;
* &quot;lock&quot; → &quot;locks&quot; (also the plural of &quot;ditch&quot;)

Other nouns with this change include: &quot;bath&quot;, &quot;(money) contribution&quot;, &quot;command&quot;, &quot;sheet of paper; magazine&quot; (not &quot;leaf&quot;), &quot;offer&quot;, &quot;roof&quot;, &quot;valley&quot;, &quot;hole&quot;, &quot;prayer&quot;, &quot;commandment&quot;, &quot;gene&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, &quot;god&quot;, &quot;duke&quot;, &quot;court&quot;, &quot;cave; burrow&quot;, &quot;member&quot;, &quot;lottery ticket&quot;, &quot;war&quot;, &quot;path&quot;, &quot;shot&quot;, &quot;strike, battle&quot;, &quot;smith&quot;, &quot;large game; spectacle&quot; (not in the sense of a smaller everyday game), &quot;staff&quot;, &quot;vat, barrel&quot;, &quot;ban, prohibition&quot;, &quot;treaty&quot;, &quot;permission&quot;, &quot;road, way&quot;.

The noun &quot;town, city&quot; has umlaut in the plural alongside lengthening: &quot;towns, cities&quot;. The plural of nouns ending in the suffix &quot;-ness, -hood&quot; is irregular .

====Plurals in ====

A few neuter nouns have a plural in . This ending derives from the old Germanic &quot;z-stem&quot; nouns, and is cognate with the English (, , etc.). The following nouns have this type of plural:
* &quot;bone&quot; → (when used in the sense &quot;leg&quot;, the plural is the regular )
* &quot;leaf&quot; → (when used in the sense &quot;sheet, magazine&quot;, the plural is )
* &quot;egg&quot; → 
* &quot;rank, file&quot; → 
* &quot;mood, emotion&quot; → 
* &quot;good&quot; → 
* &quot;fowl&quot; → 
* &quot;calf&quot; → 
* &quot;child&quot; → 
* &quot;cloth&quot; → (archaic) or &quot;clothes&quot; (nowadays a plurale tantum like in English)
* &quot;lamb&quot; → 
* &quot;song&quot; → (somewhat dated; the plural of the diminutive is often used instead: )
* &quot;wheel&quot; → 
* &quot;cattle&quot; → 
* &quot;people, nation&quot; → (the regular is also used)

When used in compounds, the stem of these nouns usually includes the . For example: &quot;eggshell&quot;, &quot;child labour&quot;, &quot;traditional costume&quot;, &quot;beef tartare&quot;. This is not a rule, however, and compounds with the singular form also exist: &quot;egg-shape&quot;, &quot;beef&quot;.

====Foreign plurals====

For a number of nouns of Latin origin, a Latin-like plural may be used. Depending on the word and the formalness of the setting, a regular plural in or can also be used.

* &quot;museum&quot; → or 
* &quot;politician&quot; → 

Some modern scientific words borrowed from Latin or Greek form their plurals with vowel lengthening, like the native words listed above. These words are primarily Latin agent nouns ending in and names of particles ending in . Alongside the change in vowel length, there is also a stress shift in the plural, patterned on the Latin third declension where this also occurs. In each case, the singular follows a Latin-like stress, while the plural stresses the or . Some examples:

* ( &quot;electron&quot;) → ( &quot;electrons&quot;)
* ( &quot;doctor (holder of a doctorate)&quot;) → ( &quot;doctors&quot;)
* ( &quot;graviton&quot;) → ( &quot;gravitons&quot;)
* ( &quot;reactor&quot;) → ( &quot;reactors&quot;)

Words borrowed from English or French will generally form their plural in , in imitation of the native plural of those languages. This applies especially to recent borrowings.
* → 

===Diminutive===

Many nouns have a diminutive form alongside the normal base form. This form is used to indicate small size, or emphasize a particular endearing quality. Use of diminutives is very common, so much that they could be considered part of the noun&#x27;s inflectional paradigm.

There are two basic ways to form the diminutive: with or with . The former is the standard way, while the latter is found in some dialects, mostly in the south (Brabantian and Limburgish). The diminutive on is common in informal Belgian Dutch (due to final-n deletion in Dutch, the final -n is often not pronounced). All diminutives have neuter gender, no matter what the gender of the original noun was. The plural is always formed with .

====Diminutive in ====

The basic suffix is modified in different ways depending on the final sounds of the noun it is attached to.

The is removed from the ending when added to words ending in a fricative or plosive (-b, -c, -d, -f, -g, -ch, -k, -p, -q, -s, -sj, -t, -v, -x, -z).

* hond → hondje
* brief → briefje
* hok → hokje
* vis → visje
* douche → doucheje ( → )
* race → raceje ( → ~ )

The last two words end in a consonant sound, despite not being spelled that way.

When the vowel of the last syllable is both short and stressed, and it is followed by a sonorant, an extra schwa is inserted, giving .
* kom → kommetje
* pil → pilletje
* lam → lammetje
* ding → dingetje
* vriendin → vriendinnetje
* baron → baronnetje

In all other cases, the basic form is used. This includes:
* Words ending in a stressed tense/long vowel or diphthong.
* Words ending in any unstressed vowel.
* Words ending in one of the above types of vowel, followed by , , .
* Words ending in one of the above types of vowel, followed by . The resulting combination is assimilated to .
* Words ending in one of the above types of vowel, followed by . The resulting combination is assimilated to .

When the final vowel is long, it is doubled accordingly. Final , which does not really occur in native Dutch words, is converted into . Final gets an apostrophe.

* koe → koetje
* auto → autootje
* mama → mamaatje
* vrouw → vrouwtje
* taxi → taxietje
* baby → baby&#x27;tje
* school → schooltje
* kuil → kuiltje
* maan → maantje
* muur → muurtje
* appel → appeltje
* boom → boompje
* duim → duimpje
* bodem → bodempje
* koning → koninkje
* houding → houdinkje

In the case of the vowels and , there is some ambiguity. While pronounced short in many dialects, they can also be long for some speakers, so forms both with and without the extra can be found.
* bloem → bloemetje &quot;or&quot; bloempje (however has an additional meaning: )
* wiel → wieltje &quot;or&quot; wieletje

====Diminutive in ====

In the south, the ending is often used instead. It also has different forms depending on the preceding sounds, with rules very similar to those for the ending.

An older form of this ending was , which is more like its German cognate . This form is not used much today, due to final n-deletion which is common in Dutch, but it is still found in older texts and names. A famous example is .

When the word ends in a velar consonant (-g, -ch, -k, -ng), an extra dissimilative is inserted, giving .
* dag → dagske
* lach → lachske
* stok → stokske
* ding → dingske
* koning → koningske

An extra is inserted in three cases, giving :
* Words ending in a non-velar plosive (-p, -b, -t, -d).
* Words ending in , which is not a velar itself but would assimilate to one before the following .
* Words ending in , or preceded by a stressed short vowel.

Examples:

* hond → hondeke
* voet → voeteke
* map → mappeke
* boon → boneke
* bon → bonneke
* kom → kommeke
* hol → holleke
* bar → barreke

In all other cases, the ending is the basic . This includes:
* Words ending in a vowel.
* Words ending in a non-velar fricative (-f, -v, -s, -z).
* Words ending in , , preceded by a long vowel, diphthong, or unstressed vowel.

Examples:

* mama → mamake
* koe → koeke
* slof → slofke
* doos → dooske
* school → schoolke
* muur → muurke
* boom → boomke
* bodem → bodemke

====Umlaut in diminutives====

Standard Dutch, as well as most dialects, do not use umlaut as a grammatical marker. However, some eastern dialects (East Brabantian, Limburgish and many Low Saxon areas) have regular umlaut of the preceding vowel in diminutives. As this is not a standard feature, it is rare in the written language except when used to evoke a local feeling. It can be more common in the spoken language. Some examples:
* → 

====Diminutives of nouns with irregular plurals====

Nouns with irregular plurals tend to have the same irregularity in the diminutive as well. This is not a rule, however, and both forms can often be found. For some nouns, the irregularity is more common in the plural of the diminutive, and only rarely appears in the singular. Some examples:

* &quot;leaf; sheet of paper&quot; → &quot;small leaf; folio&quot;, in plural also 
* &quot;day&quot; → &quot;short day&quot;, in plural also 
* &quot;drinking glass&quot; → &quot;small glass&quot;
* &quot;child&quot; → &quot;toddler&quot;, in plural also 
* &quot;path&quot; → &quot;narrow or short path&quot; (vs. &quot;toad&quot; → &quot;toadlet&quot;)
* &quot;wheel&quot; → or &quot;little wheel&quot;
* &quot;ship&quot; → &quot;little ship&quot;
* &quot;game&quot; → &quot;toy&quot;
* &quot;barrel&quot; → &quot;small barrel&quot;

===Cases===
Noun cases were still prescribed in the formal written standard up until the 1940s, but were abolished then because they had long disappeared from the spoken language. Because of this, they are nowadays restricted mostly to set phrases and are archaic. The former Dutch case system resembled that of modern German, and distinguished four cases: nominative (subject), genitive (possession or relation), dative (indirect object, object of preposition) and accusative (direct object, object of preposition). Only the nominative and genitive are productive, with the genitive seldom used and only surviving in the margins of the language. Some examples of the three non-nominative cases in fixed expressions:

* Genitive: &quot;judgement day&quot;, &quot;Kingdom of the Nederlands&quot;
* Dative: &quot;in fact&quot;, &quot;nowadays&quot;, &quot;hereby&quot;
* Accusative: &quot;eventually&quot;, &quot;good evening&quot;

The role of cases has been taken over by prepositions and word order in modern Dutch. For example, the distinction between direct and indirect object is now made by placing the indirect object before the direct object, or by using the preposition &quot;aan&quot; &quot;to&quot; with the indirect object. The genitive is replaced with the preposition &quot;van&quot; &quot;of&quot;. Usage of cases with prepositions has disappeared as well. Nowadays, the case of each noun is interpreted mainly by word order. Nominatives go first, datives after, and lastly the accusatives. Nouns after prepositions are also accusative.

Cases are still occasionally used productively, which are often calques of existing phrases. This is particularly true of the genitive case, which is still used occasionally to evoke a formal style. Speakers&#x27; awareness of how the cases were originally used is generally low. People may confuse the old masculine/neuter genitive article and the corresponding noun ending with the article (with no ending) used for feminine or plural nouns.

==Articles==

Dutch has both a definite article (&quot;the&quot;) and an indefinite article (&quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;).
 and are normally pronounced and , only emphatically as and , respectively. They may sometimes also be contracted in spelling to reflect this: , .

There is no indefinite article in the plural, the noun is just used on its own. However, there is a negative indefinite article (&quot;no, not a, not any&quot;). Similarly to it is invariable, showing no inflection for gender or number.

* (&quot;That is not a man&quot;)
* (&quot;That is not a woman&quot;)
* (&quot;That is not a house&quot;)
* (&quot;Those aren&#x27;t men&quot;)
* (&quot;I have no water&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any water&quot;)

The articles formerly had forms for the different cases as well. See Archaic Dutch declension for more information.

==Adjectives and adverbs==

Within the Dutch noun phrase, adjectives are placed in front of the noun and after the article (if present).

===Inflection===

The inflection of adjectives follows the gender and number of the following noun. They also inflect for definiteness, like in many other Germanic languages. When preceded by a definite article, demonstrative determiner, possessive determiner or any other kind of word that acts to distinguish one particular thing from another, the definite form of the adjective is used. In other cases, such as with an indefinite article, indefinite determiner (like &quot;many&quot; or &quot;all&quot;), the indefinite form is used.

Despite the many different aspects that determine the inflection of an adjective, the adjective only occurs in two main forms. The uninflected form or base form is the adjective without any endings. The inflected form has the ending . The inflection of adjectives is as follows:

Adjectives are only inflected in this way when they are in an attributive role, where they precede a noun and modify it. Adjectives in a predicative role, which are used in predicative sentences with a copula verb, are not inflected and always use the uninflected form. Compare:

* (&quot;the small man&quot;) — (&quot;the man is small&quot;)
* (&quot;small houses&quot;) — (&quot;houses are small&quot;)

Most adjectives ending in have no inflected form. This includes adjectives for materials, as well as the past participles of strong verbs.

* (&quot;the wooden chair&quot;)
* (&quot;the brick house&quot;)
* (&quot;the broken lamps&quot;)

Adjectives that end in a vowel in their uninflected form are rare, and there are no fixed rules for them. Often, the uninflected and inflected forms are the same, but sometimes an extra is added on anyway.

====Additional uses of the uninflected form====

Uninflected adjectives are occasionally found in other contexts. With neuter nouns, if the adjective is inherently part of the noun as part of a set phrase, then the uninflected form is often used in the definite singular as well:

* (&quot;the public transport&quot;, as a specific entity)
* (&quot;the public transport&quot;, meaning the transport that is public, it could be any transport)
* (&quot;the big dictionary of the Dutch language&quot;, as a proper title)
* (&quot;the big dictionary of the Dutch language&quot;, a dictionary that happens to be big)
* (&quot;the civil code&quot;, as a proper name)

Indefinite adjectives describing people often remain uninflected, if they express a personal quality. This is not stylistically neutral, but has a formal, rhetorical or poetic ring to it, and can occasionally distinguish literal meanings of an adjective from a more figurative one. Furthermore, this is only done with some nouns, not all.

* (&quot;a talented writer&quot;) — (the same)
* (&quot;a great man&quot;; figurative meaning) — (&quot;a big/tall man&quot;; literal meaning) — (&quot;a great/big/tall woman&quot;; is always used with )

===Partitive===

Adjectives have a special form called the partitive that is used after an indefinite pronoun such as &#x27;something&#x27;, &#x27;nothing&#x27;, &#x27;much, a lot&#x27;, &#x27;little, a few&#x27;. The partitive form takes the ending .

* (&quot;Tell me something interesting.&quot;)
* (&quot;I&#x27;ve got to meet somebody new.&quot;)

Adjectives already ending in or don&#x27;t take this ending:

* (&quot;I&#x27;ve put on something purple.&quot;) (the base form is already )
* (&quot;There isn&#x27;t much fantastic about it.&quot;)

The few adjectives that end in a long vowel take instead with an apostrophe like certain noun plurals.

* (&quot;I didn&#x27;t like purple so much, so now I have something lilac.&quot;)

===Adjectives used as adverbs===

The uninflected form of an adjective is implicitly also an adverb. This makes it hard at times to distinguish adjectives and adverbs in Dutch.

* (&quot;That is a fast car. The car drives fast.&quot;)
* (&quot;We were kindly welcomed by those kind people.&quot;)

===Adjectives used as nouns===

The inflected form of an adjective can also be used as a noun. Three types can be distinguished:

* The noun that the adjective refers to is omitted but implied. The adjective will then be inflected as if the noun had been present, although the inflected form is normally used even in the indefinite neuter singular.
** (&quot;You can buy this car in various colours. Do you want the green, the blue or the yellow one?&quot;)
** (&quot;We have three children, two big ones and a small one.&quot;, alternatively )
* The adjective is used as a masculine/feminine noun in its own right, usually referring to a person. The will always be added, even to adjectives that already end in . The plural is formed with .
** (&quot;You drive like a blind person!&quot;)
** (&quot;Where are you, my loved one?&quot;)
** (&quot;Release the prisoner!&quot;, from the past participle &quot;captured, imprisoned&quot;)
** (&quot;The rich should help the poor.&quot;)
* The adjective is used as a neuter mass noun describing a concept.
** (&quot;I can&#x27;t answer, because I don&#x27;t understand what was asked.&quot;)
** (&quot;Fear of the unknown is very normal.&quot;)

===Comparative and superlative===

Adjectives have three degrees of comparison: positive, comparative, and superlative. The comparative and superlative are formed synthetically, by adding endings to the adjective. The comparative and superlative can also be formed analytically by using &quot;more&quot; and &quot;most&quot;, but this is much rarer than in English. The analytic forms are used only when the word would become particularly long, or when it would become hard to pronounce (particularly in the superlative).

The comparative is formed by adding to the base form. For adjectives that end in , the comparative is formed by adding to the base form instead. The comparative inflects as an adjective in its own right, having inflected and partitive forms. The uninflected comparative can be used as an adverb as well.

* (&quot;I&#x27;m big, but you&#x27;re bigger.&quot;)
* (&quot;This toy can be dangerous for smaller children.&quot;)
* (&quot;This coat is more expensive.&quot;)
* (&quot;Do you have nothing cheaper?&quot;)
* (&quot;You did it even more fantastically than last time!&quot;)

The superlative is formed by adding . This is equivalent to adding to the partitive, and the same rules apply. When an adjective ends in or , this becomes and , but these forms are more rarely used, and the analytic form with is preferred.

* (&quot;Mont Blanc is the highest mountain of the Alps.&quot;)
* (&quot;This is the dirtiest toilet I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;, alternatively )

Because it is most often used to distinguish one particular thing from all others, the superlative is generally accompanied by a definite article. This means it is rarely found in the uninflected form. Even in predicative sentences, a definite article precedes, so it becomes more like a noun phrase with an implied noun.

* (&quot;This coat is the most expensive.&quot;)
* (&quot;This house is the biggest.&quot;)

When used as an adverb, the superlative is always preceded by the neuter article , unlike in English where this is optional. Either the uninflected or the inflected form can be used, without any difference in meaning. This form can also be used as part of predicative sentences, which can lead to a mismatch of genders which may seem odd at first glance, but is correct nonetheless:

* (&quot;This coat is (the) most expensive&quot;)
* (&quot;This house is (the) biggest.&quot;)
* (&quot;Our car drives (the) fastest of all.&quot;)

The first sentence meaning &quot;This coat is the most expensive&quot; has the same meaning as the first sentence further above. They are interchangeable, but they would be parsed differently. With the article , there is an implied noun, and it might better be translated as &quot;the most expensive &quot;one&quot;&quot;. The superlative must also be in the inflected form in this case, would be incorrect. With the article , there is no implied noun, and both the inflected () and uninflected form () can be used.

Some comparatives and superlatives are suppletive, and use a different root than the base form. These are irregular.

* &#x27;good/well, better, best&#x27;
* &#x27;much/many, more, most&#x27;
* &#x27;little/few, less/fewer, least/fewest&#x27;
* &#x27;willingly/gladly, rather/more preferably, most preferably&#x27;
* &#x27;often, more often, most often&#x27;

When an adjective is a compound of an adverb and a verb participle, the adverb sometimes changes rather than the whole word. A space may be added as well.

* &#x27;close/nearby, closer, closest&#x27;
* &#x27;densely populated, more densely populated, most densely populated&#x27;

==Pronouns and determiners==

===Personal pronouns===
As in English, Dutch personal pronouns still retain a distinction in case: the nominative (subjective), genitive (≈ possessive) and accusative/dative (objective). A distinction was once prescribed between the accusative 3rd person plural pronoun and the dative , but it was artificial and both forms are in practice variants of the same word. These two cases are still sometimes taught to students, and may be used in formal Dutch, but no distinction is made in the everyday spoken language.

Like many other European languages, Dutch has a T-V distinction in its personal pronouns. The second-person pronouns, which are used to refer to the listener, exist in informal and formal varieties. However, because of the relatively complex and dialect-specific way in which the pronouns developed, this is less straightforward than it is in for example French or German. The old Germanic/Indo-European second-person singular pronoun / (English ) fell out of use in Dutch during the Middle Ages, while it remained in use in the closely related Limburgish and in neighboring Low German, West Frisian and German languages. The role of the old singular pronoun was taken over by the old plural form, which differed slightly depending on dialect: in the South, in the North. This development also happened in English, which once had a T-V distinction but then lost it when the old informal pronoun was lost. In Dutch, however, further changes occurred, and the North and South developed differently:

* In the North and in the standard language, a new formal pronoun was introduced, which made distinctly informal. A new second-person plural pronoun was created by adding &quot;people&quot; to the old singular (compare English ). This created , an informal pronoun when speaking to many people. The formal pronoun is used for both singular and plural.
* In many Southern dialects, the older situation remained, and is still a neutral way to speak to a person in those dialects. However, informal and formal are commonly used in the standard language of the South, like in the North.
* Many dialects created their own plural forms of pronouns, such as or similar in the South for the second person plural, and also for the third person plural (&quot;they&quot;), which later became a standard in Afrikaans. These forms are not part of standard Dutch.

Many pronouns can occur in a stressed form and an unstressed (clitic) form. The stressed form retains the original full vowel, and is used when particular emphasis or contrast is needed. The unstressed form normally replaces the vowel with a schwa and is used in other cases. The unstressed forms are shown in brackets; those spelled with an apostrophe or hyphen are not used often in formal written text, and are used mainly in informal speech.

In addition to , , and having unstressed counterparts, they are themselves in a technical way unstressed forms of the demonstrative pronouns; is an unstressed form of , while the rest are a form of . It is formal and normal to replace these personal pronouns with demonstrative pronouns.

* (He/she likes milk.)
* (It is very fast.)

The pronouns are the only place in the standard language where the difference between masculine and feminine gender is significant. Consequently, the usage of the pronouns differs depending on how many genders are distinguished by a speaker. Speakers in the North will use feminine pronouns for female people, and the masculine pronouns for male people and for common-gender (masculine or feminine) nouns. In the South, the feminine pronouns are used for feminine nouns and the masculine pronouns are used for masculine nouns. See Gender in Dutch grammar for more details.

The standard language prescribes that in the third person plural, is accusative and is to be used for the direct object, and is dative, and is for the indirect object. This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers. Consequently, the third person plural forms and are interchangeable in normal usage, with being more common. The shared unstressed form is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use.

In the West and among younger speakers, in informal spoken language, is also used as a subject pronoun by some. This is considered heavily stigmatised and substandard.

===Possessive determiners===

Possessive determiners also have stressed and unstressed forms, like the pronouns.

Possessive determiners are not inflected when used attributively, unlike adjectives. Thus:

* (&quot;He is my husband.&quot;)
* (&quot;That is my house.&quot;)

An exception is , which inflects like an indefinite adjective, receiving when used with a masculine, feminine or plural noun. Possessive determiners are themselves definite in meaning, so any following adjectives will occur in the definite form even when the possessive itself does not:

* (&quot;our big house&quot;)
* (&quot;our big houses&quot;).

The inflected form is also used when the determiner is used predicatively. It is always preceded by a definite article in this case, giving the appearance of an implied noun. For example: (&quot;This is my car. The car is mine.&quot;, more literally &quot;The car is the my one&quot;). has no inflected form, the sentence is usually rephrased with instead: (&quot;The car is of you.&quot;)

Before the case system was abolished from written Dutch, and in southern spoken language, all possessive determiners inflect(ed) as indefinite adjectives, not only . They also used to inflect for case. While this is no longer done in modern Dutch, some relics still remain in fixed expressions. See Archaic Dutch declension for more details.

===Demonstrative determiners===
Like English, Dutch has two sets of demonstrative for different degrees of distance. A third, unspecific degree also exists, which is fulfilled by the personal pronouns, but see further below on pronominal adverbs.

The demonstratives inflect like indefinite adjectives, but irregularly. They are themselves definite in meaning, so any following adjectives will occur in the definite form.

When the demonstrative pronoun is used exophorically (referring to something that has not yet been mentioned in the text) with a copula verb, the &quot;uninflected&quot; forms and are always used:
* (&quot;This is my new car. I bought this one yesterday.&quot;)
Even though is of common gender and otherwise requires the form . In this sentence, the first pronoun () is exophoric, while the second one () refers back to .

The exophoric pronoun, when used in a predicative sentence, is always the complement and never the subject. The inflection of the verb follows the other argument instead, and will be plural even when the pronoun is not:
* (&quot;That is a new house&quot;)
* (&quot;This is my father&quot;)
* (&quot;Those are new houses&quot;, notice singular , with plural verb agreeing with plural noun )
* (&quot;These are my children&quot;, same with )

===Pronominal adverbs===
A pronominal adverb is a location adverb that corresponds in meaning to a pronoun, and takes its place. These exist in English as well, but are rare; examples are (&quot;by that&quot;), (&quot;with this&quot;) and (&quot;upon what&quot; or &quot;upon which&quot;).

Pronominal adverbs are used to replace the combination of prepositions with pronouns. They are very common in Dutch, and in some cases mandatory. The following table shows the pronouns that have adverbial forms:

Both the combination of preposition+pronoun and the pronominal adverb can often be used, although the adverbial form is more common. The pronoun is used mainly when one needs to be specific about it. The neuter pronoun can never appear as the object of a preposition; the adverbial form is mandatory. Combinations of a preposition and a relative pronoun are also usually replaced by a pronominal adverb. E.g. The combination (with which) is distinctly dated and usually replaced by .
The masculine and feminine pronouns are used more often in the pronoun form, particularly when referring to persons, but the adverbial form may be used occasionally as well.

Pronominal adverbs are formed by replacing the pronoun by its corresponding locative adverb and the preposition by its adverbial form and putting them &quot;in reverse order&quot;. The locative adverbs , and are separated from the prepositional part by a space, while the other four are joined to it. For example:

* (&quot;I&#x27;m counting on your support.&quot;)
* (&quot;I&#x27;m counting on it.&quot;)
* (&quot;I&#x27;m counting on nothing.&quot;, more freely &quot;I&#x27;m not counting on anything.&quot;)

For most prepositions the adverbial form is with the preposition itself, but there are two exceptions:
* &quot;with&quot; → 
** (&quot;He agrees with all proposals.&quot;)
** (&quot;He agrees with it.&quot;)
** (&quot;He agrees with everything.&quot;)
* &quot;(up) to&quot; → 
** (&quot;I can&#x27;t bring myself to (commit) these atrocities.&quot;)
** (&quot;I can&#x27;t bring myself to this.&quot;)

There are prepositions like , , that do not possess an adverbial form, which makes it difficult to use them in a relative construction, because the relative pronouns like , are becoming obsolete.

Conversely, there are a number of prepositional adverbs like or that cannot be used as prepositions, but they occur regularly as part of a pronominal adverb or of a separable verb.

The adverbial pronoun and the prepositional adverb can be separated from each other, with the prepositional part placed at the end of the clause. This is not always required, however, and some situations allow them to remain together.

* (&quot;That, I am counting on.&quot;), they can be combined too: or 
* (&quot;I am not counting on it.&quot;), here they must be separated.

Notice that in Dutch the last word is generally analyzed as an &quot;adverb&quot;, not a preposition. Thus, the often quoted &#x27;rule&#x27; that a sentence should not end in a preposition is strictly adhered to.

==Verbs==

Dutch verbs inflect for person and number, and for two tenses and three moods. However, there is considerable syncretism among the forms. In modern usage only the present singular indicative has different forms for different persons, all other number, tense and mood combinations have just one form for all persons.

Dutch verbs inflect in these two main tenses:
* The present tense is used to indicate present or future time, and may therefore be considered a &quot;non-past&quot; tense. It can express actions that are punctual, progressive or habitual.
* The past tense is used to indicate past time. The actions can be progressive or habitual at the time being discussed, as well as punctual in a sequence of retold events. It is not used to indicate completed punctual events that have relevance for the present; instead the (periphrastic) present perfect is used in this role. Contrast Dutch with English — the time being discussed is past, but it is considered relevant in the present moment.

Verbs also inflect for the following moods:
* The indicative mood is the default mood of Dutch and is used for general statements.
* The subjunctive mood is used for statements that are perceived as hypothetical or desired. Due to syncretism it is only clearly distinguished from the indicative in the present singular. It is only slightly productive in modern Dutch, and is mainly restricted to formulaic phrases otherwise, such as &quot;long live the king&quot; or &quot;may they rest in peace&quot;. Usually, it is replaced by the indicative or by a periphrastic conditional phrase.
* The imperative mood is used for commands. It exists only for the second person; imperatives for other persons are expressed periphrastically ( &quot;let&#x27;s...&quot;). Only one form is used for both the singular and plural imperative in modern Dutch. The older separate plural imperative form has fallen out of use and is now archaic or overly formal in tone.

Other grammatical categories such as future tense, passive voice, progressive or perfect aspect may be expressed periphrastically. Verbs additionally have an infinitive and two participles (present and past).

===Conjugation===
Dutch conjugation resembles that of other continental West Germanic languages such as (Standard) German and Low German, and also the other Germanic languages to a lesser degree. Dutch retains the two main types of verb inherited from Proto-Germanic: weak and strong. Preterite-present verbs are also present, but can be considered irregular. All regular verbs conjugate the same in the present tense (including the infinitive and present participle), so the weak versus strong distinction only matters for the past tense.

The following is a general overview of the endings:

Weak verbs are the most common type of verb in Dutch, and the only productive type (all newly created verbs are weak). They form their past tense with an ending containing a dental consonant, or . Which of the two is used depends on the final consonant of the verb stem. If the stem ends in a voiceless consonant, then is used, otherwise . It is often summarised with the mnemonic &quot;&#x27;t kofschip&quot;: if the verb stem ends with one of the consonants of (), then the past tense will have . However, it also applies for , and and any other letter that is voiceless in pronunciation.

* (&quot;to work, worked&quot;)
* (&quot;to learn/teach, learned/taught&quot;)
* (&quot;to rage, raged&quot;)
* (&quot;to lose/get rid of, lost&quot;)

Strong verbs are less common in Dutch, but they include many of the most common verbs. They form their past tenses by changing the vowel of the stem (ablaut). For strong verbs one needs to learn three or four principal parts: the infinitive, the past (singular), optionally the past plural, and the past participle. However, the vowel patterns are often predictable and can be divided into seven or so classes, based on the vowels used in these three principal parts. Some verbs are a mixture of two classes.

Examples:

* (&quot;ride, rode, ridden&quot;, class 1)
* (&quot;bind, bound, bound&quot;, class 3a)
* (&quot;give, gave, given&quot;, class 5)
* (&quot;walk/run, walked, walked&quot;, class 7b)

A number of verbs mix the strong and weak types of past. They have a strong past participle but all the other past tense forms are weak, or the other way around.

* (&quot;laugh, laughed, laughed&quot;, weak past, strong past participle)
* (&quot;salt, salted, salted&quot;, weak past, strong past participle)
* (&quot;ask, asked, asked&quot;, strong past, weak past participle)

Some of the most used verbs in the Dutch language have irregular conjugations which don&#x27;t follow the normal rules. This includes especially the preterite-present verbs. These verbs historically had present tense forms that resembled the past tenses of strong verbs, and can be recognised in modern Dutch by the absence of the in the third-person singular present (the English equivalents lack the in the same way). Preterite-present verbs have weak past tenses, but often irregularly formed. Many of these verbs are now used as auxiliary verbs.

The additional of the second-person -form is optional in the past tense for weak verbs and is usually considered archaic. For strong verbs, the -t is always required.

====Modal Verbs====

Like English, Dutch uses modal verbs, such as (&quot;can&quot;), (&quot;may&quot;), (&quot;shall/will&quot;), (&quot;must&quot;), and (&quot;want&quot;). These verbs act abnormally and in conjunction with infinitives. Modal verbs are among the few verbs which have irregular conjugation in the present tense.

A special feature of Dutch modal verbs not present in English is that speakers tend to omit the infinitive verb (&quot;go&quot;), (&quot;come&quot;), and similar verbs when a modal verb is finite and there is a preposition.

* (&quot;I do not want to go to school.&quot;)
* (&quot;He wants to come by car.&quot;)

===Non-finite forms===

Dutch possesses present and past participles.

====Present participle====

The present participle is always progressive in meaning, and indicates that something is performing the action as the subject. It is usually used as an attributive adjective, and inflects as such as well.

* (&quot;I saw a falling star.&quot;)
* (&quot;Barking dogs don&#x27;t bite.&quot;)
* (&quot;The news spreads like wildfire.&quot; — literally &quot;like a running fire&quot;)

It can also be used as an adverb, meaning &quot;while ...ing&quot;. Either the uninflected or inflected form can be used, although the uninflected form is more common outside set phrases.

* (&quot;One learns while doing.&quot;)
* (&quot;This work is so easy, I&#x27;m getting rich while sleeping.&quot;)
* (&quot;Crying, the boy told what had happened that day.&quot;)

Rarely, the present participle is used as a predicate, to indicate progressive actions as in English, such as (&quot;The ball was rolling.&quot;). This is usually associated with a stilted or overly formal style. It is more usual to use plus the infinitive.

The present participle of a transitive verb can be preceded by an object or an adverb. Often, the space between the two words is replaced with a hyphen or removed altogether, creating a compound adjective.
* (&quot;I was stuck in slow-moving traffic.&quot;)
* (&quot;The little dog let out a heart-rending cry.&quot;)
* (&quot;Rock-throwing youths are an increasingly severe problem.&quot;)

====Past participle====

The past participle indicates completed actions. It is also used to form the perfect and the passive voice with a variety of auxiliary verbs. The formation of these is discussed in the section &quot;periphrastic forms&quot;.

As an adjective, the meaning of the past participle can be either active (having performed the action) or passive (having undergone the action), depending on the type of verb:

* For transitive verbs, the meaning is passive. Examples:
** (&quot;The made choice (the choice that had been made) turned out to be not so great.&quot;)
** (&quot;Broken glass is dangerous.&quot;)
* For unaccusative intransitive verbs, the meaning is active. Examples:
** (&quot;The fallen man could not get back up again.&quot;)
** (&quot;Everyone went looking for the dog that had disappeared.&quot;)
* For unergative intransitive verbs, the past participle cannot be used as an adjective at all. These participles can not be used with a copula such as (&quot;to be&quot;) either, but only to form the perfect.

Like present participles, past participles can be preceded by an adverb.
* (&quot;Hastily-made choices often lead to problems later.&quot;)
* (&quot;I prefer freshly-made orange juice.&quot;)
* (&quot;Learned young is done old.&quot;, a proverb)

====Infinitive====

=====Verb phrases=====
The infinitive can be used in larger verb phrases with an auxiliary verb or modal verb, much as in English. Like present participles, the infinitive can be accompanied by an object or adverb.

* (&quot;I can see the car&quot;)

=====Verbal noun=====
The infinitive also doubles as a verbal noun, corresponding to the English gerund in . The infinitive, when used as a noun, is neuter and has no plural. Dutch also has a feminine gerund in , but this is no longer productive and usually has a concrete, technical meaning, e.g. &#x27;borrowing, lending&#x27; vs. &#x27;loan&#x27;; &#x27;educating&#x27; vs. &#x27;education&#x27;.

* – &#x27;The killing of people is forbidden&#x27;, or less literally &#x27;Killing people is forbidden&#x27;.
* – &#x27;I hate waiting.&#x27;

In the past, the infinitive was inflected for the dative and genitive. There are a few remnants of the latter, e.g. in:

* – &#x27;See you!&#x27;
* . – &#x27;A distance that can be walked in one hour.&#x27;

It also occurs in expressions involving (until ... resulted):

* – &#x27;He was beaten until bleeding resulted.&#x27;

=====Impersonal imperative=====
The infinitive is also commonly used as a kind of impersonal or polite imperative (&quot;infinitivus pro imperativo&quot;). This often has a meaning much like the English “one must (not)…” or “please do (not)…” and can be used to soften a direct command into more of a strong request, or to make the command more general (e.g. on signs and in written instructions) rather than directed at the listener or reader at that specific moment in time. The distinction is not always clear, and often both the infinitive and the imperative may be used without a strong difference in meaning.

* &#x27;No smoking&#x27; (or less literally &#x27;please refrain from smoking&#x27;), versus &#x27;don&#x27;t smoke!&#x27;.
* &#x27;Pay here&#x27;, alternatively .
* &#x27;Shake before use&#x27;.

=====With =====
The infinitive is often preceded by the preposition , analogous to the phrase + verb in English. It is used in combination with certain verbs like &#x27;to begin&#x27;.

* (&quot;He started to cough&quot;)

In combination with &#x27;to be&#x27; it can express a potentiality.

* (&quot;That was to be expected&quot;).

The extended form can be used as an adjective:

* (&quot;The crowd that is to be expected&quot;)

But it can still carry adverbial expressions or objects:

* (&quot;The crowd that is be expected in that case&quot;).

Compound infinitives also exist for the perfect and the future, as well as for the passive voice of transitive verbs, and they can be used to form abridged dependent clauses.

* (&quot;He promised that he would pay that&quot;)

===Transitivity===

Depending on meaning and use, Dutch verbs belong to one of a handful of transitivity classes:
* Unergative intransitive verbs do not take a grammatical object, and have active meaning (the subject is the agent). The perfect is formed with the auxiliary . They possess an impersonal passive voice.
* Unaccusative intransitive verbs do not take a grammatical object, and have passive or middle meaning (the subject is the patient or there is no clear agent). The perfect is formed with the auxiliary .
* Transitive verbs take a grammatical object. The subject is the agent, the object is either direct (patient) or indirect. The passive voice is formed with the auxiliary . The perfect is formed with the auxiliary when the direct object becomes subject, and with the auxiliary when the indirect object becomes subject. The perfect passive is formed with .
* Ditransitive verbs take two grammatical objects, a direct object (patient) and an indirect object. These act like transitive verbs in most respects.
* Middle verbs, also called verbs of innocence, are essentially transitive unaccusative verbs, and take a grammatical object. The perfect is formed with the auxiliary , while the passive is formed with and the perfect passive also with . The use of the perfect auxiliary carries an implication that the subject is not the direct initiator of the action or cannot or does not want to be held responsible for it. This includes verbs such as &quot;to forget&quot; and &quot;to lose (an object)&quot;.
* Reflexive verbs are accompanied by a reflexive pronoun as object
* Impersonal verbs only take an indefinite pronoun (it) as subject
* Absolute verbs are similar to unergatives, but they lack an impersonal passive form

Verbs can belong to several classes at once, depending on use. Specifically, many transitive verbs can also be used intransitively, and are thus ambitransitive. For example, &quot;I eat an apple&quot; contains a transitive verb, while &quot;I eat&quot; contains an unergative intransitive verb. Most ditransitive verbs can also be used as monotransitive verbs (with only one object, direct or indirect) or even as intransitives.

Whether an intransitive use is unergative or unaccusative depends both on the verb and on the meaning in which it is used. Generally, most transitive verbs become unergatives when the object is removed; these are accusative verbs. But there is also a sizable number of so-called ergative verbs, which become unaccusative when there is no object. Consequently, these verbs switch from active to either passive or middle meaning when the object is dropped. Examples exist in both Dutch and English, such as the transitive &quot;I break the glass&quot; versus unaccusative &quot;the glass breaks&quot;. In both cases, the glass is the patient, but in the first case it&#x27;s the direct object while in the second it&#x27;s the subject. The auxiliary of such verbs is used for both passive and intransitive use, making those uses essentially indistinguishable. The phrase can be interpreted as both &quot;the glass has been broken&quot; and &quot;the glass is broken&quot;.

Alongside the normal conjugated verb forms, Dutch has a variety of verbal meanings that are expressed using auxiliary verbs or other additional words. The use of auxiliary verbs, particularly of the perfect tenses and the passive voice -if extant-, depends on the transitivity class of the verb.

====Perfect, future and passive====

The perfect indicates that an action is complete. In Dutch the completion can take place in present, past, present future or past future:

* &#x27;I ate&#x27;, literally &#x27;I have eaten&#x27; – present perfect (with simple past meaning)
* &#x27;I had eaten&#x27; or &#x27;I had been eating&#x27; – past perfect (with pluperfect meaning)
* &#x27;I shall have eaten&#x27; – future perfect
* &#x27;I would have eaten&#x27; – past conditional (either as future-in-the-past or conditional mood)

The future tenses all take the auxiliary verb , cognate with English .
The passive voice indicates that the subject undergoes the action rather than performing it itself. Both categories are formed with a variety of auxiliary verbs.

As can be seen in the table, in the case of unaccusative verbs, the auxiliary cannot be used for the perfect, unlike in English. In general these are verbs that describe a process (e.g. to happen, melt, die) rather than an action. That means that there is no (clear) actor involved.

As in English, ergative verbs can occur both in a transitive (I break the glass) and in an unaccusative mode (the glass breaks). In Dutch the perfect of the latter takes &#x27;to be&#x27;, so that can either be seen as a perfect passive or as a perfect unaccusative. Dutch differs from German in that the latter language would add the participle to the passive sentence: .

Unergatives in general do possess passive forms, but they are &quot;impersonal&quot;. They typically take the adverb as a dummy subject and are hard to translate directly into English. means something like &#x27;There&#x27;s barking going on&#x27; or &#x27;There&#x27;s some dog barking&#x27;. Impersonal constructions of this kind are quite common in the language. The passives of transitive verbs can also be given an impersonal flavor by adding the dummy adverb , provided the subject is indefinite, e.g. &#x27;There are boxes being opened&#x27; or &#x27;Boxes are being opened&#x27;.

Verbs of motion like &#x27;to walk&#x27;, &#x27;to swim&#x27;, &#x27;to ride, drive&#x27; typically occur as unaccusative / unergative pairs. If the motion is directional it is seen as a and the auxiliary is . If the motion is not directional it is seen as an action and the auxiliary verb is , unless the verb is used in the impersonal passive in which case it can take and .
;directional
* – &#x27;I am walking home&#x27;
* – &#x27;I walked home&#x27;
;non-directional
* – &#x27;I walk a lot&#x27;
* – &#x27;I walked a lot&#x27;
* – &#x27;There is a lot of walking going on&#x27;
Note also that the meanings of the formations that use correspond to the meaning of the past participle when used as an adjective. Thus, unergative verbs can never use as the auxiliary as their past participles cannot be used as adjectives. Furthermore, for ergative verbs, the passive does not differ significantly in meaning from the regular intransitive present tense. This is also true of English: a glass that is a glass that .

The forms listed above can occur in both present and past tense. The table lists the present tense forms, while the past tense is formed by conjugating the auxiliary verb in the past tense. Thus, this creates &#x27;I had opened the box.&#x27; and so on.

When the perfect is created from a phrase that already uses an auxiliary verb, the auxiliary gets used in the infinitive form, rather than the past participle. Some auxiliary verbs even have no past participle due to this. For example:
* &#x27;I will come tomorrow.&#x27; → &#x27;I had been going to come tomorrow.&#x27;
* &#x27;He has to close the door.&#x27; → &#x27;He has had to close the door.&#x27;

=====Ditransitive verbs=====
Ditransitive verbs carry both a direct and an indirect object. In English both objects can become the subject of a passive construction and the same auxiliary is used to form it:

*I give the man a book
*The man is given a book by me
*A book is given to the man by me.

In Dutch a verb like (to donate) follows a similar pattern but the auxiliary (to get) is used for the pseudo-passive construction that renders the indirect object into the subject, whereas is used for passive involving the direct object:

*Ik schenk de man een boek
*De man krijgt van mij een boek geschonken
*Een boek wordt door mij aan de man geschonken.

The following three groups of verbs only take the auxiliary in the perfect tenses.

=====Impersonal verbs=====
Impersonal verbs have no true subject, but use a dummy subject pronoun (&quot;it&quot;). These verbs often refer to conditions, such as the weather:
* (&quot;It rains.&quot; or &quot;It is raining.&quot;)
* (&quot;A thunderstorm is happening.&quot;)

=====Reflexive verbs=====
Reflexive verbs take a reflexive pronoun like , or as their (dummy) direct object and take in the perfect. This contrasts with e.g. French, where être (to be) is used as perfect auxiliary.

*Ik vergiste me (I mistook, made an error)
*Ik heb me vergist

Some of these occur in pairs with a transitive form, replacing the unaccusative component of an ergative.

*Ratten verspreiden de ziekte – -(Rats spread the disease)
*De ziekte verspreidt zich – (The disease is spreading)

There are no verbs that &quot;only&quot; occur in a reciprocal form, but those that can take the reciprocal pronoun (each other) also take in the perfect, thus behaving like reflexive ones.

*Massa&#x27;s trekken elkaar aan. – (Masses attract each other.)
*De magneten hadden elkaar aangetrokken – (The magnets had attracted each other).

=====Absolute verbs=====
These verbs resemble the unergative ones, except that they do not possess an impersonal passive.

*De zon schijnt – (The sun shines)
* *Er wordt geschenen &lt;- does not exist -&gt;

Some of them may carry a direct object, but they have neither a personal, nor an impersonal passive:

*Een jas aanhebben – (To wear a coat)
* *Een jas wordt aangehad &lt;- does not exist -&gt;

Similarly the past participle cannot be used as adjective:

* *De aangehadde jas &lt;- does not exist -&gt;

====Future====

Although the present tense can be used to indicate future events, there is also a more explicit future tense in Dutch. It is formed using the auxiliary (&quot;will, shall, be going to&quot;), which can be conjugated in both present and past tense. The &quot;past future&quot; carries a sense having pledged or promised to do something, or having been expected to do it, much as &quot;was/were going to&quot; does in English.

* (&quot;I will do it tomorrow.&quot; or &quot;I am going to do it tomorrow.&quot;)
* (&quot;You were going to clean the windows yesterday!&quot;)

An alternative future tense is formed using (&quot;to go&quot;) as the auxiliary. It is used in its literal meaning to indicate that one is moving to a place to perform an action, or is intending to do so (&quot;be going to go&quot;). More generally, it can indicate any kind of intention or plan to perform the action. It can also imply the start of an action in the future.

* (&quot;I&#x27;m going to go shopping with my friends tomorrow.&quot;)
* (&quot;For today the work is done; tomorrow they&#x27;re going to continue working.&quot;)
* (&quot;It&#x27;s going to start raining hard in a moment.&quot;)

====Conditional====

The conditional mood is formed using the past tense of , which is in the singular and in the plural. It is therefore somewhat analogous to the use of &quot;would&quot; in English, as the past tense of the future auxiliary &quot;will&quot;. The conditional is identical in form to the &quot;past future&quot; described above, but is always accompanied by some kind of condition that the verb depends on, usually introduced with conjunctions like (&quot;if&quot;).

* (&quot;I would not do that if I were you.&quot;)
* (&quot;He would not have cleaned the windows, if they were not dirty.&quot;)

====Progressive====

The progressive aspect indicates that an action is ongoing and in progress. It is formed using + + infinitive of action verb. It is equivalent to the English &#x27;be ...-ing&#x27; or &#x27;be in the middle of ...-ing&#x27;, but is not used as often.

* &#x27;You&#x27;ll have to wait (a while), I am eating now.&#x27;
* &#x27;He was cleaning the windows when the phone rang.&#x27;

Unlike in English, the progressive cannot be combined with the perfect to make a hypothetical &quot;perfect progressive&quot;. Both &quot;I have been eating&quot; and &quot;I had been eating&quot; are expressed using the simple past tense form of the progressive: 

A similar expression is + + infinitive of action verb or + action noun.

* &#x27;He&#x27;s (busy) repairing the clock&#x27;.
** Or: &#x27;Idem&#x27;.
* &#x27;You&#x27;re spending the whole day helping that child.&#x27; (notice the superfluous which is colloquial).

A different way to render progressive aspect is to use the (static) verbs &#x27;to sit&#x27;, &#x27;to walk&#x27;, &#x27;to stand&#x27; and &#x27;to lie&#x27; with + infinitive. These verbs, when in the perfect, all use a double infinitive.
* – &#x27;I&#x27;m sat down eating&#x27; (UK) or &#x27;I&#x27;m sitting here eating&#x27; (North America).
* – &#x27;I&#x27;m stood (here) cleaning windows&#x27; (UK) or &#x27;I&#x27;m standing here cleaning windows&#x27; (North America).
* – &#x27;Jantje is sleeping&#x27;.

The literal meaning of the verbs &quot;to sit&quot; or &quot;to stand&quot; etc. is often secondary to their durative aspect.

==Numerals==
Dutch uses a decimal numeral system. Numerals are not inflected.

===0–9===
The numbers from 0 to 9 are:

 is the same word as the indefinite article in the written language. When confusion is possible, the number is often written as to distinguish it from the article. The pronunciation differentiates them in speech: the article is , the numeral is .

===10–19===

The numbers 10, 11 and 12 are irregular. 13 to 19 are formed by adding (&quot;-teen&quot;) to the base number. Two are slightly irregular: 13 is with metathesis (compare English ), and 14 is .

===20–99===

The decades 20 to 90 are formed by adding (&quot;-ty&quot;) to the base number. However, some are slightly irregular: 20 is , 30 and 40 are and (comparable to 13 and 14 above), 80 is . The remaining decades, although spelled beginning with and , are often pronounced beginning with voiceless and even in dialects that do not devoice these consonants normally.

Combinations of a decade and a unit are constructed in a regular way: the unit comes first, followed by (&quot;and&quot;), followed by the decade. No spaces are written between them, and a diaeresis is added when necessary. For example:

* 28 (&quot;eight and twenty&quot;)
* 83 (&quot;three and eighty&quot;)
* 99 (&quot;nine and ninety&quot;)

===Hundreds===

100 is . Multiples of 100 are expressed by placing the multiple before , without any spaces: 200 , 300 and so on. Sometimes multiples higher than 10 can be used as synonyms for the thousands, such as 1100 , 2500 .

Combinations of a hundred and a lower number are expressed by just placing them together, with the hundred coming first. Sometimes, is added in between, but this is optional and not commonly done nowadays.

* 112 or 
* 698 
* 1258 

===Thousands===

1000 is . Unlike in English, this is not preceded by an article. The same system used for naming the hundreds applies to the thousands as well, so multiples of 1000 are expressed by writing the multiple right before: 2000 , 3000 , 20000 , 999000 .

Combinations of a thousand and a lower number are expressed by placing them together, with the thousand coming first. A space is written between them.

* 1 258 
* 9 001 
* 32 348 
* 123 456 

===Millions and above===

Dutch always uses the long scale system.

* 1 000 000 
* 1 000 000 000 
* 1 000 000 000 000 
* 1 000 000 000 000 000 
* etc.

Multiples of any of these are similar to the thousands, but a space is written between the multiple and the &quot;million&quot;: 2 000 000 , 420 000 000 000 . If the multiple is 1, it must also be present, unlike with the thousands where it is left out: 1 000 000 .

Combinations with lower numbers are much the same as with the thousands.

* 117 401 067 
* 10 987 654 321 

===Ordinal numbers===

Ordinal numbers behave and inflect like superlative adjectives. Unlike normal adjectives, they always appear in the inflected form; always ending in ignoring whether the following noun is neuter or not, and are usually preceded by a definite article of some kind.

The ordinal adjectives are formed by adding either or to the base number. Which one is added depends on the word. The numbers 1 and 3 have irregular ordinals.

When a number is composed of multiple parts, the ending is added only to the last part of the word, and follows the rules for that word. Thus, 21st , 409th , 9001st .

===Fractional numbers===

Fractional numbers are expressed using a cardinal number for the numerator, and an ordinal for the denominator, like in English.
* 1/5 
* 3/8 
1/2 and 1/4 are (&quot;a half&quot;) and (&quot;a quarter&quot;) respectively, although the regular and are also possible, but rarer. In 3/4, the space is often left out: .

When combined with a full cardinal, the full cardinal comes first and they are separated by and spaces. The word can be left out if the numerator is not 1.
* 9 3/4 
* 5 1/6 
* 3 1/2 
The combination 1 1/2 is usually expressed irregularly as , which literally means &quot;other half&quot; ( was originally a synonym of , and this combination meant &quot;second, minus a half&quot;).

===Iterative numbers===

These express repetition, like &quot;once&quot; or &quot;five times&quot;. They are formed with a cardinal number followed by or (both meaning &quot;times&quot;).
* (&quot;two times, twice&quot;)
* (&quot;nine times&quot;)
* (&quot;a hundred times&quot;)
The space is often left out for the combinations (&quot;once&quot;), (&quot;twice&quot;) and (&quot;thrice&quot;), but not with .

There are also ordinal forms of these, which express an iteration within a sequence of repetitions. They are formed with an ordinal instead of a cardinal, and act as masculine nouns.
* (&quot;the first time&quot;)
* (&quot;the thirtieth time&quot;)

===Multiplicative numbers===

These express a multiple of something. They are formed with the suffix &#x27;-fold&#x27; and are neuter nouns.
* &#x27;a twofold, multiple of two&#x27;
* &#x27;a threefold, multiple of three&#x27;
* &#x27;a hundredfold, multiple of hundred&#x27;
For the number 1, &#x27;singular(ity), a onefold&#x27; is used, which is derived from &#x27;single&#x27; rather than . The &quot;regular&quot; form instead means &#x27;simpleness, uncomplicatedness, ease&#x27;.

Adjectives are formed by adding to this, giving the combination .
* &#x27;double, twofold&#x27;
* &#x27;triple, threefold&#x27;
* &#x27;hundredfold&#x27;
Again, &#x27;single, simple, onefold&#x27; is used for 1, and means &#x27;simple, uncomplicated, easy&#x27;. Alternatively, the word &#x27;single&#x27; can be used alone. A synonym for is .

<doc id="393727" wikidata="Q310815" url="?curid=393727" title="Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos">
<text>Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos (born 5 March 1950), known as Nandó, is an Angolan politician who was the first vice president of Angola from February 2010 to September 2012. He was the prime minister of Angola from 2002 to 2008 and president of the National Assembly of Angola from 2008 to 2010. He has again served as president of the National Assembly from 2012 to 2022.

==Early life and education== 
Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos was born in Luanda, Portuguese Angola to parents emigrating to Angola from São Tomé and Príncipe. 
Piedade is a cousin of President José Eduardo dos Santos. He obtained a BA in Law in 2009 at Agostinho Neto University in Angola.

==Career==
In 1971, Piedade joined the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). Following Angola&#x27;s independence from Portugal in 1975 he began a career in the People&#x27;s Police Corps of Angola, becoming a division head in 1978. In 1981 he moved to the Ministry of the Interior, becoming Deputy Minister in 1984. The following year he was elected as a member of the MPLA-Workers&#x27; Party congress and given the rank of colonel in the Angolan military. He later became a member of the People&#x27;s Assembly, beginning a succession of appointments to government ministerial posts.

After having served as Interior Minister since 1999, Piedade was appointed prime minister in November 2002 and took office on December 6, 2002. The office of prime minister had previously been unoccupied for three years.

Piadade was the 14th candidate on the MPLA&#x27;s national list in the September 2008 legislative election. In the election, the MPLA won an overwhelming majority, and Piedade was elected to a seat in the National Assembly.

Following the 2008 election, the MPLA Political Bureau chose Piedade to become the president of the National Assembly on September 26, 2008. It also chose Paulo Kassoma to replace Piedade as prime minister. On September 30, the newly elected members of the National Assembly met and were sworn in; Piedade was elected as president of the National Assembly on this occasion, receiving 211 votes in favor and three opposed.

On January 21, 2010, the National Assembly approved a new constitution that would increase presidential powers, eliminate the office of prime minister, and eliminate popular elections for the office of president. Piedade described the National Assembly&#x27;s adoption of the constitution as a &quot;historic moment&quot;. President dos Santos then appointed Piedade to the newly established office of Vice-President of Angola on February 3, 2010. Having long served as a close and powerful associate of dos Santos, his appointment as Vice-President made it appear more likely that he was being envisioned as the eventual successor to dos Santos. However, dos Santos had already been designated as the MPLA candidate for president in 2012, suggesting that he had no intention of retiring.

In 2012, Manuel Vicente, who had headed the state oil company Sonangol, was believed to have been selected by the President as his likely successor. Vicente was designated as the second candidate on the MPLA&#x27;s list of parliamentary candidates, making him the party&#x27;s nominee for the post of Vice-President. Following the MLPA&#x27;s victory in the 2012 legislative election, Vicente took office as Vice President on 26 September 2012, succeeding Piedade. On 27 September 2012, Piedade was instead elected as President of the National Assembly.
==Personal life==

He is married to Maria Tomé Dias dos Santos and they have 7 children.

<doc id="393729" wikidata="Q365451" url="?curid=393729" title="Lester Bird">
<text>Sir Lester Bryant Bird (21 February 1938 – 9 August 2021) was an Antiguan politician and athlete who served as the second prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda from 1994 to 2004. He was chairman of the Antigua Labour Party (ALP) from 1971 to 1983, then became prime minister when his father, Sir Vere Bird, the previous prime minister, resigned.

==Early life and education==
Bird was born in New York City on February 21, 1938. Lester and his elder brother Vere Bird Jr., also a British-educated lawyer, were considered sometime rivals, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing in 1990 that Lester had always overshadowed his brother, according to those who have known them both. He was educated at Antigua Grammar School and was brought up as a Methodist. Bird was a cricketer in his youth, playing for the Leeward Islands, and a long jump champion. He won a bronze medal in the long jump at the 1959 Pan American Games in Chicago while representing the British West Indies. He attended the University of Michigan, where he was All-American long jumper in 1960 and graduated in 1962. Bird completed his study of law in Britain and was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1969. From 1969 to 1976, Bird engaged in private practice in Antigua.

==Political career==
Bird&#x27;s political career began in 1971, when he was nominated to the Senate. The frequently-dominant Antigua Labour Party was in opposition for a five-year period. Bird was named chairman of the ALP and the leader of the opposition in the Senate. Lester continued to serve as leader of the opposition until he was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1976 elections, when the ALP returned to power. Bird joined his father&#x27;s government as Deputy Premier. In addition to serving as Deputy Prime Minister, Bird also served as Minister of Economic Development, Tourism, and Energy. Bird&#x27;s tenure as Minister of Tourism and Minister of Economic Development was controversial, and he personally benefited from tourism partnerships with foreign investors, including in the construction of the Royal Antiguan Hotel.

Following independence in 1981, Bird gained the external affairs portfolio and was the first chairman of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States in 1982. He was chairman of OECS for a second time in 1989. The ALP government and Bird himself won re-election in 1994 and 1999. These elections, as well as the 1989 elections, were highly controversial; the 1989 elections were &quot;marred by irregularities and fraud&quot; and charges made by the opposition, described as credible by Freedom House, that the ALP used bribery and intimidation and exerted undue influence over the elections supervisor. The 1999 election was deemed neither free nor fair in an independent report which concluded that the opposition United Progressive Party (UPP) &quot;conceivably could have won a majority of seats in parliament&quot; if the election had been fair.

The ALP had been divided by a succession crisis between Lester Bird and Vere Bird Jr., since 1989. Lester Bird lost his deputy prime minister post in 1991, but retained the external affairs ministry and the planning and trade portfolio. Sir Vere Bird was initially thought to have favoured Vere Jr. until an arms scandal in which the elder son had been found to have been involved in the smuggling of weapons from Antigua to the Colombian Medellín Cartel. Vere Bird Jr., then Minister of Public Works, was dismissed from office and an inquiry, led by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, Q.C., recommended that he never be allowed to hold office again (although he subsequently did return to office), boosting Lester Bird&#x27;s chances to follow his father in the prime ministership and reducing pressure for Vere Bird to step down.

In 1992, another scandal, involving Sir Vere Bird&#x27;s siphoning of public funds into a personal account, furthered calls for him to step down, with three opposition parties uniting to form the UPP under the leadership of Baldwin Spencer. Following a successful general strike called by the UPP, Sir Vere announced in March 1992 he would step down at the 1994 general elections. The ALP succession crisis continued following this, with a special convention to elect a successor on 24 May 1992 resulting in a deadlock between Lester Bird and John St. Luce, the information minister. The ALP leadership question was finally settled at the party&#x27;s September 1993 convention, at which Lester won the leadership of the party, defeating St Luce, 169 votes to 131. The party post of ALP chairman went to Vere Jr.

In the March 1994 elections, the ALP under Bird&#x27;s leadership won 11 out of 17 seats even as the opposition criticized the ALP over corruption issues. During the election the ALP pledged open government, an ombudsman to deal with citizen complaints, and new jobs, especially in tourism. Bird assumed the prime ministership on 9 March 1994. He appointed St. Luce (but not his brother Vere Jr.) to the cabinet. (Vere Jr. was subsequently named special adviser). Lester Bird took the portfolios for external affairs, planning, social services, and information for himself, and in a 1996 cabinet reshuffle also took the communications, civil aviation, international transport, and gaming portfolios.

In the 1999 elections, the ALP increased its parliamentary majority by one seat, holding 12 seats. Bird was reconfirmed as prime minister and elevated Vere Jr. to the cabinet as minister of agriculture, marking his full political rehabilitation. Bird also shuffled his own portfolios and by December 2002 held the foreign affairs, finance, legal affairs, justice, and national security ministries in addition to being the prime minister.

In the March 2004 election, the ALP was defeated by the United Progressive Party (UPP) led by Baldwin Spencer. Bird&#x27;s party lost eight seats, and he himself was defeated by Errol Cort, who became Minister of Finance in the new UPP government.

Bird remained the ALP&#x27;s political leader following the party&#x27;s 2004 defeat. He led the party in the March 2009 election; although the ALP lost the election, it gained 3 seats from the UPP and Bird defeated Cort by 96 votes in the St John&#x27;s Rural East constituency, where he had lost in 2004. He subsequently held the position of Leader of Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition.

Bird was succeeded as ALP leader by Gaston Browne in December 2012, who led the party to victory in June 2014 general election. Bird won a seat and again defeated Errol Cort.

In 2014, he was made a Knight of the Order of the National Hero (KNH) by Antigua and Barbuda.

== Death ==
Bird died at the age of 83 on 9 August 2021.

<text>Perry Gladstone Christie PC, MP (born 21 August 1943) is a Bahamian former politician who served as prime minister of the Bahamas from 2002 to 2007 and from 2012 to 2017. He is the second longest-serving Bahamian elected parliamentarian (behind Sir Roland Symonette who was first elected to parliament in 1925 and served until 1977), representing the Centreville constituency from 1977 to 2017. He is also a former athlete. His Progressive Liberal Party is the oldest Bahamian political party, holding solid majorities in the Bahamian Parliament several times in its long history.

==Political career==

Christie is believed to have been the youngest Bahamian ever appointed to the Senate. Named as a Senator by Prime Minister Lynden Pindling in November 1974, Christie served in that capacity until June 1977. In January 1977 he was appointed chairman of the Gaming Board, which regulates casinos in The Bahamas.

Receiving the PLP&#x27;s nomination for the Centreville constituency in the 1977 general election, Christie was elected Member of Parliament for that constituency, and shortly afterward appointed Minister of Health and National Insurance, and held that position until 1982. During the June 1982 general election, he was re-elected Member of Parliament for Centreville, and was once again appointed to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Cabinet, but as Minister of Tourism.

A dynamic minister, Christie moved tourism in The Bahamas to new heights. In 1984, however, he was dismissed from the cabinet, and during the 1987 general election ran as an independent candidate. He retained his seat in the Centreville constituency. Three years later – in March 1990 – Christie returned to the fold of the Progressive Liberal Party, and was appointed minister of agriculture, trade and industry by the prime minister. Christie&#x27;s ministerial responsibilities included the ministry of agriculture, trade and industry; mining, geological surveys, petroleum, fuel, oils and petrochemicals, industries encouragement, manufacturing, relations with The Bahamas Agricultural and Industrial Corporation, relations with The Bahamas National Trust, Andros reef and blue holes, and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Co-operatives.

In January 1993, following the PLP&#x27;s defeat in the August 1992 general election, Christie was elected co-deputy leader of the PLP with responsibility for party activities outside parliament. Victorious in the newly created Farm Road constituency in the general election, he was elected leader of the PLP at a special convention on 5 April 1997 and appointed as leader of the opposition by the Governor-General on 7 April. Christie thus succeeded Lynden Pindling, who had led the PLP since 1956.

Perry held the additional portfolio of Minister of Finance from 2002 to 2007, and from 2012 to 2017.

===Events since 2007===
Christie&#x27;s party, the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), was defeated in the May 2007 general election, taking 18 seats against 23 for the Free National Movement (FNM), and Christie conceded defeat in a phone call to FNM leader Hubert Ingraham. After the new FNM government was sworn in, Christie was sworn in as leader of the opposition.

In November 2009, Christie was overwhelmingly elected, and returned as Leader of the PLP at its Annual General Convention, garnering more than 80% of the vote over Dr. Bernard Nottage.

Christie was re-elected as Prime Minister of the Bahamas on 7 May 2012.

Christie has brought programmes like Urban Renewal.

Christie also introduced Value Added Tax at a rate of 7.5%. The money raised from VAT was slated to pay off National Debt.

No Freedom of Information Act has even been implemented under his government, although while in opposition he pushed for it.

Multiple human rights violations have been investigated under his leadership, none of which have been solved.

===10 May 2017 General Elections===
In a landslide defeat by the Free National Movement (FNM), the PLP was defeated in the 10 May 2017 general elections with the FNM winning 35 seats, and the PLP winning only 4 seats. The historic win also resulted in the unseating of Perry Christie from his Centerville seat by a mere four votes, a constituency which he had represented for 40 consecutive years.

<text>Owen Seymour Arthur (17 October 194927 July 2020) was a Barbadian politician who served as the fifth prime minister of Barbados from 6 September 1994 to 15 January 2008. He is the longest-serving Barbadian prime minister to date. He also served as Leader of the Opposition from 1 August 1993 to 6 September 1994 and from 23 October 2010 to 21 February 2013.

Arthur was a firm advocate for regional integration and cooperation among the countries of the Caribbean. He was described by CARICOM as the chief architect of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy. He argued in favour of making the Caribbean Court of Justice the final court of appeal for countries of the Caribbean, and he advocated for the University of the West Indies regional airline LIAT, and projection of resistance against infringement on sovereignty by large nations.

==Early life and education==
Arthur studied at All Saints Boys’ School, Coleridge and Parry Boys&#x27; School, and Harrison College. He earned a BA degree in economics and history in 1971 at the University of the West Indies – Cave Hill, Barbados, and an MSc degree in economics in 1974 at the University of the West Indies – Mona, Jamaica. After graduating, he joined Jamaica&#x27;s National Planning Agency as an Assistant Economic Planner and later served as Director of Economics at the Jamaica Bauxite Institute between 1979 and 1981. In 1981, he returned to Barbados and worked for the Barbadian Ministry of Finance and Planning (1981–1983, 1985–1986) and also served as a Research Fellow at the UWI&#x27;s Institute of Social and Economics Research [now the Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies (SALISES)] from 1983 to 1985.

==Political career==
===Member of Parliament===
Arthur was appointed to the Senate of Barbados in 1983, and won a by-election to the House of Assembly in 1984 for the constituency of Saint Peter. In 1985 he was appointed to be parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, a position he held until 1986. Arthur served concurrently as a part-time lecturer in management at UWI Cave Hill until he was chosen to be the leader of the Barbados Labour Party in 1993, making him the parliamentary Leader of the Opposition.

===Fifth Prime Minister of Barbados (1994–2008)===

In September 1994, the Labour Party won the general elections, making Arthur Prime Minister. He also acted as Minister of National Security, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Information, and appointed four female ministers, including all three female BLP MPs. The youngest of the four, 29 year-old Mia Mottley, eventually succeeded him as party leader in 2008 and was elected Prime Minister in 2018.

In 1995, Arthur devised the formation of a parliamentary law reform commission led by Henry Forde to advise on constitutional and institutional reform of Barbados Government., and Arthur would also that year become appointed a Privy Counsellor, giving him the title of &quot;Right Honourable.&quot; As part of Arthur government&#x27;s agenda he dedicated much of his work as Prime Minister towards advancing Caribbean regional integration, including by spearheading the creation of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy in 2001 with the signing of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas.

Arthur sought for Barbados to host several international community events including the UN Global Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) which led to the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, also referred to as the Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA), and further served as a principle negotiator in the 1997 Partnership for Prosperity and Security in the Caribbean also known as the &quot;Bridgetown Declaration&quot; between the West Indian nations and the United States.

After completing a popular first term, the BLP won a record-breaking 26 of 28 seats in the 1999 general election. A national plan for beautification of major business and community centres including Bridgetown, Holetown, Oistins, Speightstown, Warrens, and Wildey were devised and put into motion along with plans to greatly liberalise the Barbados economy and expand cultural industries. Plans for Double Taxation Agreements to spur international financial sector trade linkages, and for airport and seaport modernisation were also a focus.

The BLP kept a dominant majority by winning 23 of 28 seats in the 2003 general election, ensuring him
a third term. A prominent plank of Arthur&#x27;s platform for the 2003 elections was his promise to transform the country into a parliamentary republic, replacing Queen Elizabeth II with a Barbadian President as Head of State. Arthur planned to hold a national referendum on this proposition in 2005.

However, this timeline was pushed back due to other pressing developments, such as the implementation of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy and leading complex and difficult negotiations of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the CARIFORUM- and European Union bloc of countries along with the resulting joint Parliament.

Closer to home, Arthur took genuine interest in advancing plans for the regional hosting of the Cricket World Cup 2007. On 18 June 2007, Arthur gave an address at the U.S. Library of Congress to American and CARICOM country officials that outlined his plan for the CSME.

On 25 March 2007, on the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire, Parliament passed a resolution acknowledging that slavery was a crime against humanity. On this occasion, Arthur expressed support for slavery reparations; he felt that educational exchanges and technology transfers would be more appropriate than financial payments.

===Leader of Opposition===
In the general election held on 15 January 2008, the Barbados Labour Party was defeated by the Democratic Labour Party, winning ten seats against 20 for the DLP. DLP Chairman David Thompson was sworn in as prime minister on 16 January, succeeding Arthur. Despite the party&#x27;s defeat, Arthur was re-elected to his own seat from St. Peter constituency with 65% of the vote. He also maintained that he could still contribute to CARICOM. On 19 January, Arthur stepped down as BLP leader, saying that an immediate leadership transition would be in the best interests of both the party and Barbadian democracy; former Deputy Prime Minister Mia Mottley was elected as the new party leader over former Attorney-General of Barbados Dale Marshall. Arthur said that he intended to serve out his parliamentary term.

In 2010, Arthur was given a vote of confidence by four of his parliamentary colleagues to return as Leader of the BLP after they expressed dissatisfaction with Mottley. A Barbados Labour Party leadership election was held on 16 October 2010 and Arthur defeated Mottley. Arthur was sworn in as Barbados&#x27; new Opposition Leader on 18 October 2010.

In the February 2013 general election, the BLP was narrowly defeated, obtaining 14 seats against 16 for the DLP. Arthur was re-elected to his seat. A few days after the election, on 26 February 2013, the BLP parliamentary group held a leadership election and elected Mottley as Leader of the Opposition, replacing Arthur. According to the party, Arthur was not present at the election in order to &quot;give the members of the parliamentary grouping the freedom to choose the future of the Barbados Labour Party&quot;.

On 25 July 2014, Arthur submitted his resignation from the Barbados Labour Party, citing disagreements with Mottley, and served the rest of his term as an independent M.P. He did not stand in the 2018 Barbadian general election, and BLP member Colin Jordan was elected as the new M.P. for Saint Peter. After leaving the House of Assembly, Arthur retired from politics.

==Later career==
Arthur was appointed professor of practice in Economics of Development at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill, on 1 November 2018. He was the third professor of practice at the UWI Cave Hill Campus.

In January 2020, Arthur was appointed as Chairman of regional airline LIAT to supervise its financial recovery. He had been a staunch supporter of LIAT during his premiership.

Arthur was Chairman of the Commonwealth Observer Group during the 2020 Guyanese general election; he confirmed that the election had been orderly. He later criticized the incumbent APNU+AFC alliance for their months-long attempts to delay finalizing the election results.

==Death==
Arthur was hospitalized with heart complications in July 2020. He died in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown at 12:26 a.m on 27 July. The late prime minister was accorded a state funeral through which he was brought to the Barbados House of Assembly to lay in state from August 12–13. Tributes followed from peers across the Americas and also from Commonwealth Secretary-General, The Baroness Scotland of Asthal.

== Honours and awards ==
Arthur was a 1999 recipient of the Order of José Martí of Cuba.

<doc id="393736" wikidata="Q484511" url="?curid=393736" title="Inductive reasoning">
<text>Inductive reasoning refers to a variety of methods of reasoning in which broad generalizations or principles are derived from a set of observations. Unlike &quot;deductive&quot; reasoning (such as mathematical induction), where the conclusion is &quot;certain&quot;, given the premises are correct, inductive reasoning produces conclusions that are at best &quot;probable&quot;, given the evidence provided.

== Types ==
The types of inductive reasoning include generalization, prediction, statistical syllogism, argument from analogy, and causal inference. There are also differences in how their results are regarded.

=== Inductive generalization ===
A generalization (more accurately, an &quot;inductive generalization&quot;) proceeds from premises about a sample to a conclusion about the population. The observation obtained from this sample is projected onto the broader population.

: The proportion Q of the sample has attribute A.
: Therefore, the proportion Q of the population has attribute A.

For example, if there are 20 balls—either black or white—in an urn: to estimate their respective numbers, a &quot;sample&quot; of four balls is drawn, three are black and one is white. An inductive generalization may be that there are 15 black and five white balls in the urn. However this is only one of 17 possibilities as to the &quot;actual&quot; number of each color of balls in the urn (the &quot;population)&quot; -- there may, of course, have been 19 black and just 1 white ball, or only 3 black balls and 17 white, or any mix in between. The probability of each possible distribution being the actual numbers of black and white balls can be estimated using techniques such as Bayesian inference, where prior assumptions about the distribution are updated with the observed sample, or maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which identifies the distribution most likely given the observed sample.

How much the premises support the conclusion depends upon the number in the sample group, the number in the population, and the degree to which the sample represents the population (which, for a static population, may be achieved by taking a random sample). The greater the sample size relative to the population and the more closely the sample represents the population, the stronger the generalization is. The hasty generalization and the biased sample are generalization fallacies.

==== Statistical generalization ====
A statistical generalization is a type of inductive argument in which a conclusion about a population is inferred using a statistically representative sample. For example:

:Of a sizeable random sample of voters surveyed, 66% support Measure Z.
:Therefore, approximately 66% of voters support Measure Z.

The measure is highly reliable within a well-defined margin of error provided that the selection process was genuinely random and that the numbers of items in the sample having the properties considered are large. It is readily quantifiable. Compare the preceding argument with the following. &quot;Six of the ten people in my book club are Libertarians. Therefore, about 60% of people are Libertarians.&quot; The argument is weak because the sample is non-random and the sample size is very small.

Statistical generalizations are also called &quot;statistical projections&quot; and &quot;sample projections&quot;.

==== Anecdotal generalization ====
An anecdotal generalization is a type of inductive argument in which a conclusion about a population is inferred using a non-statistical sample. In other words, the generalization is based on anecdotal evidence. For example:

:So far, this year his son&#x27;s Little League team has won 6 of 10 games.
:Therefore, by season&#x27;s end, they will have won about 60% of the games.

This inference is less reliable (and thus more likely to commit the fallacy of hasty generalization) than a statistical generalization, first, because the sample events are non-random, and second because it is not reducible to a mathematical expression. Statistically speaking, there is simply no way to know, measure and calculate the circumstances affecting performance that will occur in the future. On a philosophical level, the argument relies on the presupposition that the operation of future events will mirror the past. In other words, it takes for granted a uniformity of nature, an unproven principle that cannot be derived from the empirical data itself. Arguments that tacitly presuppose this uniformity are sometimes called &quot;Humean&quot; after the philosopher who was first to subject them to philosophical scrutiny.

=== Prediction ===
An inductive prediction draws a conclusion about a future, current, or past instance from a sample of other instances. Like an inductive generalization, an inductive prediction relies on a data set consisting of specific instances of a phenomenon. But rather than conclude with a general statement, the inductive prediction concludes with a specific statement about the probability that a single instance will (or will not) have an attribute shared (or not shared) by the other instances.

: Proportion Q of observed members of group G have had attribute A.
: Therefore, there is a probability corresponding to Q that other members of group G will have attribute A when next observed.

=== Statistical syllogism ===
A statistical syllogism proceeds from a generalization about a group to a conclusion about an individual.

:Proportion Q of the known instances of population P has attribute A.
: Individual I is another member of P.
: Therefore, there is a probability corresponding to Q that I has A.

For example:
:90% of graduates from Excelsior Preparatory school go on to university.
:Bob is a graduate of Excelsior Preparatory school.
:Therefore, Bob will probably go on to university.

This is a &quot;statistical syllogism&quot;. Even though one cannot be sure Bob will attend university, the exact probability of this outcome is fully assured (given no further information). Two &quot;dicto simpliciter&quot; fallacies can occur in statistical syllogisms: &quot;accident&quot; and &quot;converse accident&quot;.

=== Argument from analogy ===
The process of analogical inference involves noting the shared properties of two or more things and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property:

:P and Q are similar with respect to properties a, b, and c.
:Object P has been observed to have further property x.
:Therefore, Q probably has property x also.

Analogical reasoning is very frequent in common sense, science, philosophy, law, and the humanities, but sometimes it is accepted only as an auxiliary method. A refined approach is case-based reasoning.

:Mineral A and Mineral B are both igneous rocks often containing veins of quartz and are most commonly found in South America in areas of ancient volcanic activity.
:Mineral A is also a soft stone suitable for carving into jewelry.
:Therefore, mineral B is probably a soft stone suitable for carving into jewelry.

This is &quot;analogical induction&quot;, according to which things alike in certain ways are more prone to be alike in other ways. This form of induction was explored in detail by philosopher John Stuart Mill in his &quot;System of Logic&quot;, where he states, &quot;[t]here can be no doubt that every resemblance [not known to be irrelevant] affords some degree of probability, beyond what would otherwise exist, in favor of the conclusion.&quot; See Mill&#x27;s Methods.

Some thinkers contend that analogical induction is a subcategory of inductive generalization because it assumes a pre-established uniformity governing events. Analogical induction requires an auxiliary examination of the &quot;relevancy&quot; of the characteristics cited as common to the pair. In the preceding example, if a premise were added stating that both stones were mentioned in the records of early Spanish explorers, this common attribute is extraneous to the stones and does not contribute to their probable affinity.

A pitfall of analogy is that features can be cherry-picked: while objects may show striking similarities, two things juxtaposed may respectively possess other characteristics not identified in the analogy that are characteristics sharply &quot;dis&quot;similar. Thus, analogy can mislead if not all relevant comparisons are made.

=== Causal inference ===

A causal inference draws a conclusion about a possible or probable causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect. Premises about the correlation of two things can indicate a causal relationship between them, but additional factors must be confirmed to establish the exact form of the causal relationship.

== Methods ==
The two principal methods used to reach inductive generalizations are &quot;enumerative induction&quot; and &quot;eliminative induction.&quot;

===Enumerative induction===
Enumerative induction is an inductive method in which a generalization is constructed based on the &quot;number&quot; of instances that support it. The more supporting instances, the stronger the conclusion.

The most basic form of enumerative induction reasons from particular instances to all instances and is thus an unrestricted generalization. If one observes 100 swans, and all 100 were white, one might infer a probable universal categorical proposition of the form &quot;All swans are white&quot;. As this reasoning form&#x27;s premises, even if true, do not entail the conclusion&#x27;s truth, this is a form of inductive inference. The conclusion might be true, and might be thought probably true, yet it can be false. Questions regarding the justification and form of enumerative inductions have been central in philosophy of science, as enumerative induction has a pivotal role in the traditional model of the scientific method.

:All life forms so far discovered are composed of cells.
:Therefore, all life forms are composed of cells.

This is &quot;enumerative induction&quot;, also known as &quot;simple induction&quot; or &quot;simple predictive induction&quot;. It is a subcategory of inductive generalization. In everyday practice, this is perhaps the most common form of induction. For the preceding argument, the conclusion is tempting but makes a prediction well in excess of the evidence. First, it assumes that life forms observed until now can tell us how future cases will be: an appeal to uniformity. Second, the conclusion &quot;All&quot; is a bold assertion. A single contrary instance foils the argument. And last, quantifying the level of probability in any mathematical form is problematic. By what standard do we measure our Earthly sample of known life against all (possible) life? Suppose we do discover some new organism—such as some microorganism floating in the mesosphere or an asteroid—and it is cellular. Does the addition of this corroborating evidence oblige us to raise our probability assessment for the subject proposition? It is generally deemed reasonable to answer this question &quot;yes&quot;, and for a good many this &quot;yes&quot; is not only reasonable but incontrovertible. So then just &quot;how much&quot; should this new data change our probability assessment? Here, consensus melts away, and in its place arises a question about whether we can talk of probability coherently at all with or without numerical quantification.

:All life forms so far discovered have been composed of cells.
:Therefore, the &quot;next&quot; life form discovered will be composed of cells.

This is enumerative induction in its &quot;weak form&quot;. It truncates &quot;all&quot; to a mere single instance and, by making a far weaker claim, considerably strengthens the probability of its conclusion. Otherwise, it has the same shortcomings as the strong form: its sample population is non-random, and quantification methods are elusive.

=== Eliminative induction ===
Eliminative induction, also called variative induction, is an inductive method first put forth by Francis Bacon; in it a generalization is constructed based on the &quot;variety&quot; of instances that support it. Unlike enumerative induction, eliminative induction reasons based on the various kinds of instances that support a conclusion, rather than the number of instances that support it. As the variety of instances increases, the more possible conclusions based on those instances can be identified as incompatible and eliminated. This, in turn, increases the strength of any conclusion that remains consistent with the various instances. In this context, confidence is the function of how many instances have been identified as incompatible and eliminated. This confidence is expressed as the Baconian probability i|n (read as &quot;i out of n&quot;) where n reasons for finding a claim incompatible has been identified and i of these have been eliminated by evidence or argument.

There are three ways of attacking an argument; these ways - known as defeaters in defeasible reasoning literature - are : rebutting, undermining, and undercutting. Rebutting defeats by offering a counter-example, undermining defeats by questioning the validity of the evidence, and undercutting defeats by pointing out conditions where a conclusion is not true when the inference is. By identifying defeaters and proving them wrong is how this approach builds confidence. 

This type of induction may use different methodologies such as quasi-experimentation, which tests and, where possible, eliminates rival hypotheses. Different evidential tests may also be employed to eliminate possibilities that are entertained.

Eliminative induction is crucial to the scientific method and is used to eliminate hypotheses that are inconsistent with observations and experiments. It focuses on possible causes instead of observed actual instances of causal connections.
== History ==

===Ancient philosophy===
For a move from particular to universal, Aristotle in the 300s BCE used the Greek word &quot;epagogé&quot;, which Cicero translated into the Latin word &quot;inductio&quot;.

====Aristotle and the Peripatetic School====
Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; covers the methods of inductive proof in natural philosophy and in the social sciences. The first book of describes the nature and science of demonstration and its elements: including definition, division, intuitive reason of first principles, particular and universal demonstration, affirmative and negative demonstration, the difference between science and opinion, etc.

====Pyrrhonism====
The ancient Pyrrhonists were the first Western philosophers to point out the Problem of induction: that induction cannot, according to them, justify the acceptance of universal statements as true.

====Ancient medicine====
The Empiric school of ancient Greek medicine employed &quot;epilogism&quot; as a method of inference. &#x27;Epilogism&#x27; is a theory-free method that looks at history through the accumulation of facts without major generalization and with consideration of the consequences of making causal claims. Epilogism is an inference which moves entirely within the domain of visible and evident things, it tries not to invoke unobservables.

The Dogmatic school of ancient Greek medicine employed &quot;analogismos&quot; as a method of inference. This method used analogy to reason from what was observed to unobservable forces.

===Early modern philosophy===
In 1620, early modern philosopher Francis Bacon repudiated the value of mere experience and enumerative induction alone. His method of inductivism required that minute and many-varied observations that uncovered the natural world&#x27;s structure and causal relations needed to be coupled with enumerative induction in order to have knowledge beyond the present scope of experience. Inductivism therefore required enumerative induction as a component.

====David Hume====
The empiricist David Hume&#x27;s 1740 stance found enumerative induction to have no rational, let alone logical, basis; instead, induction was the product of instinct rather than reason, a custom of the mind and an everyday requirement to live. While observations, such as the motion of the sun, could be coupled with the principle of the uniformity of nature to produce conclusions that seemed to be certain, the problem of induction arose from the fact that the uniformity of nature was not a logically valid principle, therefore it could not be defended as deductively rational, but also could not be defended as inductively rational by appealing to the fact that the uniformity of nature has accurately described the past and therefore, will likely accurately describe the future because that is an inductive argument and therefore circular since induction is what needs to be justified.

Since Hume first wrote about the dilemma between the invalidity of deductive arguments and the circularity of inductive arguments in support of the uniformity of nature, this supposed dichotomy between merely two modes of inference, deduction and induction, has been contested with the discovery of a third mode of inference known as abduction, or abductive reasoning, which was first formulated and advanced by Charles Sanders Peirce, in 1886, where he referred to it as &quot;reasoning by hypothesis.&quot; Inference to the best explanation is often, yet arguably, treated as synonymous to abduction as it was first identified by Gilbert Harman in 1965 where he referred to it as &quot;abductive reasoning,&quot; yet his definition of abduction slightly differs from Pierce&#x27;s definition. Regardless, if abduction is in fact a third mode of inference rationally independent from the other two, then either the uniformity of nature can be rationally justified through abduction, or Hume&#x27;s dilemma is more of a trilemma. Hume was also skeptical of the application of enumerative induction and reason to reach certainty about unobservables and especially the inference of causality from the fact that modifying an aspect of a relationship prevents or produces a particular outcome.

====Immanuel Kant====
Awakened from &quot;dogmatic slumber&quot; by a German translation of Hume&#x27;s work, Kant sought to explain the possibility of metaphysics. In 1781, Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; introduced &quot;rationalism&quot; as a path toward knowledge distinct from &quot;empiricism&quot;. Kant sorted statements into two types. Analytic statements are true by virtue of the arrangement of their terms and meanings, thus analytic statements are tautologies, merely logical truths, true by necessity. Whereas synthetic statements hold meanings to refer to states of facts, contingencies. Against both rationalist philosophers like Descartes and Leibniz as well as against empiricist philosophers like Locke and Hume, Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; is a sustained argument that in order to have knowledge we need both a contribution of our mind (concepts) as well as a contribution of our senses (intuitions). Knowledge proper is for Kant thus restricted to what we can possibly perceive (&quot;phenomena&quot;), whereas objects of mere thought (&quot;things in themselves&quot;) are in principle unknowable due to the impossibility of ever perceiving them.

Reasoning that the mind must contain its own categories for organizing sense data, making experience of objects in &quot;space&quot; and &quot;time (phenomena)&quot; possible, Kant concluded that the uniformity of nature was an &quot;a priori&quot; truth. A class of synthetic statements that was not contingent but true by necessity, was then synthetic &quot;a priori&quot;. Kant thus saved both metaphysics and Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. On the basis of the argument that what goes beyond our knowledge is &quot;nothing to us,&quot; he discarded scientific realism. Kant&#x27;s position that knowledge comes about by a cooperation of perception and our capacity to think (transcendental idealism) gave birth to the movement of German idealism. Hegel&#x27;s absolute idealism subsequently flourished across continental Europe and England.

===Late modern philosophy===
Positivism, developed by Henri de Saint-Simon and promulgated in the 1830s by his former student Auguste Comte, was the first late modern philosophy of science. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, fearing society&#x27;s ruin, Comte opposed metaphysics. Human knowledge had evolved from religion to metaphysics to science, said Comte, which had flowed from mathematics to astronomy to physics to chemistry to biology to sociology—in that order—describing increasingly intricate domains. All of society&#x27;s knowledge had become scientific, with questions of theology and of metaphysics being unanswerable. Comte found enumerative induction reliable as a consequence of its grounding in available experience. He asserted the use of science, rather than metaphysical truth, as the correct method for the improvement of human society.

According to Comte, scientific method frames predictions, confirms them, and states laws—positive statements—irrefutable by theology or by metaphysics. Regarding experience as justifying enumerative induction by demonstrating the uniformity of nature, the British philosopher John Stuart Mill welcomed Comte&#x27;s positivism, but thought scientific laws susceptible to recall or revision and Mill also withheld from Comte&#x27;s Religion of Humanity. Comte was confident in treating scientific law as an irrefutable foundation for all knowledge, and believed that churches, honouring eminent scientists, ought to focus public mindset on &quot;altruism&quot;—a term Comte coined—to apply science for humankind&#x27;s social welfare via sociology, Comte&#x27;s leading science.

During the 1830s and 1840s, while Comte and Mill were the leading philosophers of science, William Whewell found enumerative induction not nearly as convincing, and, despite the dominance of inductivism, formulated &quot;superinduction&quot;. Whewell argued that &quot;the peculiar import of the term &quot;Induction&quot;&quot; should be recognised: &quot;there is some Conception &quot;superinduced&quot; upon the facts&quot;, that is, &quot;the Invention of a new Conception in every inductive inference&quot;. The creation of Conceptions is easily overlooked and prior to Whewell was rarely recognised. Whewell explained:

These &quot;superinduced&quot; explanations may well be flawed, but their accuracy is suggested when they exhibit what Whewell termed &quot;consilience&quot;—that is, simultaneously predicting the inductive generalizations in multiple areas—a feat that, according to Whewell, can establish their truth. Perhaps to accommodate the prevailing view of science as inductivist method, Whewell devoted several chapters to &quot;methods of induction&quot; and sometimes used the phrase &quot;logic of induction&quot;, despite the fact that induction lacks rules and cannot be trained.

In the 1870s, the originator of pragmatism, C S Peirce performed vast investigations that clarified the basis of deductive inference as a mathematical proof (as, independently, did Gottlob Frege). Peirce recognized induction but always insisted on a third type of inference that Peirce variously termed &quot;abduction&quot; or &quot;retroduction&quot; or &quot;hypothesis&quot; or &quot;presumption&quot;. Later philosophers termed Peirce&#x27;s abduction, etc., &quot;Inference to the Best Explanation&quot; (IBE).

===Contemporary philosophy===
====Bertrand Russell====
Having highlighted Hume&#x27;s problem of induction, John Maynard Keynes posed &quot;logical probability&quot; as its answer, or as near a solution as he could arrive at. Bertrand Russell found Keynes&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Probability&quot; the best examination of induction, and believed that if read with Jean Nicod&#x27;s &quot;Le Probleme logique de l&#x27;induction&quot; as well as R B Braithwaite&#x27;s review of Keynes&#x27;s work in the October 1925 issue of &quot;Mind&quot;, that would cover &quot;most of what is known about induction&quot;, although the &quot;subject is technical and difficult, involving a good deal of mathematics&quot;. Two decades later, Russell followed Keynes in regarding enumerative induction as an &quot;independent logical principle&quot;. Russell found:

====Gilbert Harman====
In a 1965 paper, Gilbert Harman explained that enumerative induction is not an autonomous phenomenon, but is simply a disguised consequence of Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE). IBE is otherwise synonymous with C S Peirce&#x27;s &quot;abduction&quot;. Many philosophers of science espousing scientific realism have maintained that IBE is the way that scientists develop approximately true scientific theories about nature.

== Comparison with deductive reasoning ==

Inductive reasoning is a form of argument that—in contrast to deductive reasoning—allows for the possibility that a conclusion can be false, even if all of the premises are true. This difference between deductive and inductive reasoning is reflected in the terminology used to describe deductive and inductive arguments. In deductive reasoning, an argument is &quot;valid&quot; when, assuming the argument&#x27;s premises are true, the conclusion &quot;must be&quot; true. If the argument is valid and the premises &quot;are&quot; true, then the argument is &quot;sound&quot;. In contrast, in inductive reasoning, an argument&#x27;s premises can never guarantee that the conclusion &quot;must be&quot; true. Instead, an argument is &quot;strong&quot; when, assuming the argument&#x27;s premises are true, the conclusion is &quot;probably&quot; true. If the argument is strong and the premises are thought to be true, then the argument is said to be &quot;cogent&quot;. Less formally, the conclusion of an inductive argument may be called &quot;probable&quot;, &quot;plausible&quot;, &quot;likely&quot;, &quot;reasonable&quot;, or &quot;justified&quot;, but never &quot;certain&quot; or &quot;necessary&quot;. Logic affords no bridge from the probable to the certain.

The futility of attaining certainty through some critical mass of probability can be illustrated with a coin-toss exercise. Suppose someone tests whether a coin is either a fair one or two-headed. They flip the coin ten times, and ten times it comes up heads. At this point, there is a strong reason to believe it is two-headed. After all, the chance of ten heads in a row is .000976: less than one in one thousand. Then, after 100 flips, every toss has come up heads. Now there is &quot;virtual&quot; certainty that the coin is two-headed, and one can regard it as &quot;true&quot; that the coin is probably two-headed. Still, one can neither logically nor empirically rule out that the next toss will produce tails. No matter how many times in a row it comes up heads, this remains the case. If one programmed a machine to flip a coin over and over continuously, at some point the result would be a string of 100 heads. In the fullness of time, all combinations will appear.

As for the slim prospect of getting ten out of ten heads from a fair coin—the outcome that made the coin appear biased—many may be surprised to learn that the chance of any sequence of heads or tails is equally unlikely (e.g., H-H-T-T-H-T-H-H-H-T) and yet it occurs in &quot;every&quot; trial of ten tosses. That means &quot;all&quot; results for ten tosses have the same probability as getting ten out of ten heads, which is 0.000976. If one records the heads-tails sequences, for whatever result, that exact sequence had a chance of 0.000976.

An argument is deductive when the conclusion is necessary given the premises. That is, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. For example, after getting 10 heads in a row one might deduce that the coin had met some statistical criterion to be regarded as probably two-sided, a conclusion that would not be falsified even if the next toss yielded tails.

If a deductive conclusion follows duly from its premises, then it is valid; otherwise, it is invalid (that an argument is invalid is not to say its conclusions are false; it may have a true conclusion, just not on account of the premises). An examination of the following examples will show that the relationship between premises and conclusion is such that the truth of the conclusion is already implicit in the premises. Bachelors are unmarried because we &quot;say&quot; they are; we have defined them so. Socrates is mortal because we have included him in a set of beings that are mortal. The conclusion for a valid deductive argument is already contained in the premises since its truth is strictly a matter of logical relations. It cannot say more than its premises. Inductive premises, on the other hand, draw their substance from fact and evidence, and the conclusion accordingly makes a factual claim or prediction. Its reliability varies proportionally with the evidence. Induction wants to reveal something &quot;new&quot; about the world. One could say that induction wants to say &quot;more&quot; than is contained in the premises.

To better see the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, consider that it would not make sense to say: &quot;all rectangles so far examined have four right angles, so the next one I see will have four right angles.&quot; This would treat logical relations as something factual and discoverable, and thus variable and uncertain. Likewise, speaking deductively we may permissibly say. &quot;All unicorns can fly; I have a unicorn named Charlie; thus Charlie can fly.&quot; This deductive argument is valid because the logical relations hold; we are not interested in their factual soundness.

The conclusions of inductive reasoning are inherently uncertain. It only deals with the extent to which, given the premises, the conclusion is &quot;credible&quot; according to some theory of evidence. Examples include a many-valued logic, Dempster–Shafer theory, or probability theory with rules for inference such as Bayes&#x27; rule. Unlike deductive reasoning, it does not rely on universals holding over a closed domain of discourse to draw conclusions, so it can be applicable even in cases of epistemic uncertainty (technical issues with this may arise however; for example, the second axiom of probability is a closed-world assumption).

Another crucial difference between these two types of argument is that deductive certainty is impossible in non-axiomatic or empirical systems such as reality, leaving inductive reasoning as the primary route to (probabilistic) knowledge of such systems.

Given that &quot;if &quot;A&quot; is true then that would cause &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; to be true&quot;, an example of deduction would be &quot;&quot;A&quot; is true therefore we can deduce that &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; are true&quot;. An example of induction would be &quot;&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; are observed to be true therefore &quot;A&quot; might be true&quot;. &quot;A&quot; is a reasonable explanation for &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; being true.

For example:

:A large enough asteroid impact would create a very large crater and cause a severe impact winter that could drive the non-avian dinosaurs to extinction.
:We observe that there is a very large crater in the Gulf of Mexico dating to very near the time of the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.
:Therefore, it is possible that this impact could explain why the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct.

Note, however, that the asteroid explanation for the mass extinction is not necessarily correct. Other events with the potential to affect global climate also coincide with the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. For example, the release of volcanic gases (particularly sulfur dioxide) during the formation of the Deccan Traps in India.

Another example of an inductive argument:

:All biological life forms that we know of depend on liquid water to exist.
:Therefore, if we discover a new biological life form, it will probably depend on liquid water to exist.

This argument could have been made every time a new biological life form was found, and would have had a correct conclusion every time; however, it is still possible that in the future a biological life form not requiring liquid water could be discovered.
As a result, the argument may be stated as:

:All biological life forms that we know of depend on liquid water to exist.
:Therefore, all biological life probably depends on liquid water to exist.

A classical example of an &quot;incorrect&quot; statistical syllogism was presented by John Vickers:

:All of the swans we have seen are white.
:Therefore, we &quot;know&quot; that all swans are white.

The conclusion fails because the population of swans then known was not actually representative of all swans. A more reasonable conclusion would be: in line with applicable conventions, we might reasonably expect all swans in England to be white, at least in the short-term.

Succinctly put: deduction is about &quot;certainty/necessity&quot;; induction is about &quot;probability&quot;. Any single assertion will answer to one of these two criteria. Another approach to the analysis of reasoning is that of modal logic, which deals with the distinction between the necessary and the &quot;possible&quot; in a way not concerned with probabilities among things deemed possible.

The philosophical definition of inductive reasoning is more nuanced than a simple progression from particular/individual instances to broader generalizations. Rather, the premises of an inductive logical argument indicate some degree of support (inductive probability) for the conclusion but do not entail it; that is, they suggest truth but do not ensure it. In this manner, there is the possibility of moving from general statements to individual instances (for example, statistical syllogisms).

Note that the definition of &quot;inductive&quot; reasoning described here differs from mathematical induction, which, in fact, is a form of &quot;deductive&quot; reasoning. Mathematical induction is used to provide strict proofs of the properties of recursively defined sets. The deductive nature of mathematical induction derives from its basis in a non-finite number of cases, in contrast with the finite number of cases involved in an enumerative induction procedure like proof by exhaustion. Both mathematical induction and proof by exhaustion are examples of complete induction. Complete induction is a masked type of deductive reasoning.

==Problem of induction==
Although philosophers at least as far back as the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus have pointed out the unsoundness of inductive reasoning, the classic philosophical critique of the problem of induction was given by the Scottish philosopher David Hume. Although the use of inductive reasoning demonstrates considerable success, the justification for its application has been questionable. Recognizing this, Hume highlighted the fact that our mind often draws conclusions from relatively limited experiences that appear correct but which are actually far from certain. In deduction, the truth value of the conclusion is based on the truth of the premise. In induction, however, the dependence of the conclusion on the premise is always uncertain. For example, let us assume that all ravens are black. The fact that there are numerous black ravens supports the assumption. Our assumption, however, becomes invalid once it is discovered that there are white ravens. Therefore, the general rule &quot;all ravens are black&quot; is not the kind of statement that can ever be certain. Hume further argued that it is impossible to justify inductive reasoning: this is because it cannot be justified deductively, so our only option is to justify it inductively. Since this argument is circular, with the help of Hume&#x27;s fork he concluded that our use of induction is not logically justifiable .

Hume nevertheless stated that even if induction were proved unreliable, we would still have to rely on it. So instead of a position of severe skepticism, Hume advocated a practical skepticism based on common sense, where the inevitability of induction is accepted. Bertrand Russell illustrated Hume&#x27;s skepticism in a story about a chicken who, fed every morning without fail and following the laws of induction, concluded that this feeding would always continue, until his throat was eventually cut by the farmer.

In 1963, Karl Popper wrote, &quot;Induction, &quot;i.e.&quot; inference based on many observations, is a myth. It is neither a psychological fact, nor a fact of ordinary life, nor one of scientific procedure.&quot; Popper&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;Objective Knowledge&quot;—whose first chapter is devoted to the problem of induction—opens, &quot;I think I have solved a major philosophical problem: the problem of induction&quot;. In Popper&#x27;s schema, enumerative induction is &quot;a kind of optical illusion&quot; cast by the steps of conjecture and refutation during a &quot;problem shift&quot;. An imaginative leap, the &quot;tentative solution&quot; is improvised, lacking inductive rules to guide it. The resulting, unrestricted generalization is deductive, an entailed consequence of all explanatory considerations. Controversy continued, however, with Popper&#x27;s putative solution not generally accepted.

Donald A. Gillies argues that rules of inferences related to inductive reasoning are overwhelmingly absent from science, and describes most scientific inferences as &quot;involv[ing] conjectures thought up by human ingenuity and creativity, and by no means inferred in any mechanical fashion, or according to precisely specified rules.&quot; Gillies also provides a rare counterexample &quot;in the machine learning programs of AI.&quot;

===Biases===
Inductive reasoning is also known as hypothesis construction because any conclusions made are based on current knowledge and predictions. As with deductive arguments, biases can distort the proper application of inductive argument, thereby preventing the reasoner from forming the most logical conclusion based on the clues. Examples of these biases include the availability heuristic, confirmation bias, and the predictable-world bias.

The availability heuristic is regarded as causing the reasoner to depend primarily upon information that is readily available. People have a tendency to rely on information that is easily accessible in the world around them. For example, in surveys, when people are asked to estimate the percentage of people who died from various causes, most respondents choose the causes that have been most prevalent in the media such as terrorism, murders, and airplane accidents, rather than causes such as disease and traffic accidents, which have been technically &quot;less accessible&quot; to the individual since they are not emphasized as heavily in the world around them.

Confirmation bias is based on the natural tendency to confirm rather than deny a hypothesis. Research has demonstrated that people are inclined to seek solutions to problems that are more consistent with known hypotheses rather than attempt to refute those hypotheses. Often, in experiments, subjects will ask questions that seek answers that fit established hypotheses, thus confirming these hypotheses. For example, if it is hypothesized that Sally is a sociable individual, subjects will naturally seek to confirm the premise by asking questions that would produce answers confirming that Sally is, in fact, a sociable individual.

The predictable-world bias revolves around the inclination to perceive order where it has not been proved to exist, either at all or at a particular level of abstraction. Gambling, for example, is one of the most popular examples of predictable-world bias. Gamblers often begin to think that they see simple and obvious patterns in the outcomes and therefore believe that they are able to predict outcomes based on what they have witnessed. In reality, however, the outcomes of these games are difficult to predict and highly complex in nature. In general, people tend to seek some type of simplistic order to explain or justify their beliefs and experiences, and it is often difficult for them to realise that their perceptions of order may be entirely different from the truth.

== Bayesian inference ==
As a logic of induction rather than a theory of belief, Bayesian inference does not determine which beliefs are &quot;a priori&quot; rational, but rather determines how we should rationally change the beliefs we have when presented with evidence. We begin by considering an exhaustive list of possibilities, a definite probabilistic characterisation of each of them (in terms of likelihoods) and precise prior probabilities for them (e.g. based on logic or induction from previous experience) and, when faced with evidence, we adjust the strength of our belief in the given hypotheses in a precise manner using Bayesian logic to yield candidate &#x27;a posteriori probabilities&#x27;, taking no account of the extent to which the new evidence may happen to give us specific reasons to doubt our assumptions. Otherwise it is advisable to review and repeat as necessary the consideration of possibilities and their characterisation until, perhaps, a stable situation is reached.

==Inductive inference==
Around 1960, Ray Solomonoff founded the theory of universal inductive inference, a theory of prediction based on observations, for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. This is a formal inductive framework that combines algorithmic information theory with the Bayesian framework. Universal inductive inference is based on solid philosophical foundations and &#x27;seems to be an inadequate tool for dealing with any reasonably complex or real-world environment&#x27;, and can be considered as a mathematically formalized Occam&#x27;s razor. Fundamental ingredients of the theory are the concepts of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity.

Inductive inference typically considers hypothesis classes with a countable size. A recent advance established a sufficient and necessary condition for inductive inference: a finite error bound is guaranteed if and only if the hypothesis class is a countable union of online learnable classes. Notably, this condition allows the hypothesis class to have an uncountable size while remaining learnable within this framework.

<text>Keith Claudius Mitchell (born 12 November 1946) is a Grenadian politician who served as Prime Minister of Grenada from 1995 to 2008 and from 2013 to 2022. He is the longest-serving Prime Minister in Grenadian history, holding the office for more than 22 years. He was leader of the New National Party (NNP) from 1989 until 2024 and has been the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives of Grenada from 2008 to 2013, and again since 2022.

==Education and personal life==
Keith Claudius Mitchell was born in the community of Brizan, Saint George. Mitchell graduated from The University of the West Indies with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and chemistry in 1971. He gained a master&#x27;s degree from Howard University in 1975 and a doctorate in mathematics and statistics from American University in 1979. He then worked as a statistician at Applied Management Sciences, providing statistical support to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 1984, Mitchell gave up his professional activities to return home to Grenada after the U.S. invasion.

==Cricket career==
Mitchell was a cricketer, a spin bowler who captained the Grenada team in 1973. He has since been a prominent cricket administrator in the West Indies alongside his political career.

==Political career==
In the December 1984 general election, Mitchell was elected to a seat in the House of Representatives from St. George North West constituency and he has held the seat in each subsequent election. Mitchell was elected as leader of the NNP in January 1989, defeating Prime Minister Herbert Blaize. Blaize then dismissed Mitchell from his position as Minister of Communications and Works on 21 July 1989.

After the NNP was victorious in the general election held on 20 June 1995, winning eight out of 15 seats in the House of Representatives, Mitchell took office as Prime Minister, along with his Cabinet, on 22 June. Under Mitchell&#x27;s leadership, the party won all 15 seats in the early election held in January 1999, and the NNP narrowly won a third term in power in the November 2003 election, reduced to a one-seat parliamentary majority. Mitchell held the additional portfolio of Minister of Finance for three periods.

The New National Party was defeated in the general election held on 8 July 2008 by the National Democratic Congress (NDC), winning only four seats against 11 for the NDC. Mitchell himself was re-elected to his seat from St. George North West. NDC leader Tillman Thomas succeeded Mitchell as Prime Minister on 9 July. Mitchell said that the people voted for change and congratulated Thomas. Following the election, he continued as NNP leader and was sworn in as Leader of the Opposition on 16 July 2008.

In the February 2013 general election, the NNP again won all 15 parliamentary seats. After this resounding victory, Mitchell was sworn in as Prime Minister on 20 February 2013. Looking ahead to the next election, Mitchell predicted that his party could win all 15 seats in parliament for a third time. Mitchell and his New National Party created history by retaining all 15 seats in the Grenada General Election of 13 March 2018. It is the first time any political party regionally or otherwise has achieved such a feat. Mitchell held the additional portfolio of Minister of Finance until 2020.

In June 2022, Mitchell called a snap general election. His New National Party was defeated by the National Democratic Congress under Dickon Mitchell (no relation), winning just 6 seats to the NDC&#x27;s 9. Mitchell subsequently became Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives of Grenada. Ahead of the 2024 national convention of the NNP, Mitchell announced that he would not seek re-election as leader, stepping back after over 35 years in the role. He was succeeded as leader by Emmalin Pierre. Mitchell subsequently resigned as Leader of the Opposition on 21 February 2025, recommending Pierre as his successor.

== Foreign policy ==
In 1997, Mitchell became the first prime minister since Maurice Bishop to visit Cuba, signing an economic cooperation agreement. He re-established relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 2005.

Mitchell approved 1996 plans by the United States Coast Guard to build a base on Petite Martinique. He allowed medical visits from USNS Comfort (T-AH-20).

<doc id="393740" wikidata="Q57738" url="?curid=393740" title="Denzil Douglas">
<text>Denzil Llewellyn Douglas (born 14 January 1953) is a Saint Kittitian and Nevisian politician and the longest-serving prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, in office from 1995 to 2015. He was the leader of the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP) from 1989 to 2021. He was the leader of the parliamentary opposition from 1989 to 1995 and from 2015 to 2022.

==Biography==

===Early life and pre-political career===
Born on 14 January 1953 in the village of St. Pauls, Douglas studied medicine as a young man. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in 1977 and a Degree in Medicine in 1984 from the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill. In 1986 he established a private medical practice as a family physician and served as President of the St. Kitts-Nevis Medical Association in the late 1980s.

===Political life===
Douglas was elected M.P. for St. Christopher (No.6) ward (Newton Ground, St. Paul&#x27;s, Dieppe Bay, Saddlers, and Harris) in the National Assembly of Saint Kitts and Nevis in 1989 and appointed leader of the opposition. That year he was also elected leader of the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party after some internal wrangling for the leadership between himself and the then incumbent political leader Sir Lee L Moore. This internal feud surfaced after Sir Lee L Moore had lost his seat in constituency number 4.

He restructured the party in preparation for its 1995 electoral victory. He was appointed Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis in 1995, re-appointed Prime Minister in March 2000 and again in October 2004 after the Labour Party won a third term with seven of the eight seats on St. Kitts. The Labour Party won its fourth consecutive term in office on 25 January 2010, winning six of the eight seats on St Kitts in the eleven-member National Assembly.

In 2011, Douglas was responsible for the OLPC (One Laptop per Child) program, which provided 2,000 free laptops per year from Taiwan to high school students.

=== Political Controversies ===
In 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an Advisory to alert financial institutions that certain foreign individuals were abusing the Citizenship by Investment program sponsored by the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis (SKN) led by the Denzil Douglas Administration to obtain SKN passports for the purpose of engaging in illicit financial activity. As a result of these lax controls, illicit actors, including individuals intending to use the secondary citizenship to evade sanctions, can obtain an SKN passport with relative ease. These events led to the United States revoking his visa.

=== Detainment at Gatwick Airport London ===
On 16 November 2019, The Mail on Sunday reported Douglas was detained at Gatwick Airport by the UK&#x27;s Border Force. The Officers seized the equivalent of more than £70,000 – in sterling, US dollars and eastern Caribbean dollars – from him when he could not explain why he was attempting to leave the country with the cash. It was said he was the subject of a probe by the National Crime Agency.

===Appeal court ruled that Denzil Douglas must vacate seat in Parliament===

On Thursday 12 March 2020, the Government of St Kitts-Nevis Information Services SKNIS reported in a Press release that The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC) of Appeal in Castries, Saint Lucia, in a judgment handed down on, March 12, 2020, ruled that Dr. Denzil Douglas, Leader of the St. Kitts and Nevis Opposition Labour Party and Parliamentary Representative for St. Christopher Six, must VACATE his seat in the National Assembly with immediate effect over the issue of a Dominican diplomatic passport that had been granted to him by Dominica. Chief Justice, the Hon. Dame Janice M. Pereira, made the following conclusion:

&quot;The cumulative effect of my conclusions is that Dr. Douglas, by his application for, receipt and use of a Dominican diplomatic passport, placed him in clear breach of section 28(1)(a) of the Constitution. As a matter of law, the consequence in the terms of section 33(3)(c) follows. That consequence is that, Dr. Douglas is required to vacate his seat in the National Assembly in Saint Christopher and Nevis,” 

===Post-premiership===

After losing the 2015 general election he remained active in politics as leader of the opposition. Prior to the 2020 general election, Douglas had not put in place a succession plan for new leadership of the SKNLP despite calls to resign.

In 2021, Douglas decided to step down as leader of the SKNLP, while remaining the parliamentary leader of the opposition. At the national SKNLP convention on 28 November 2021, party chairman Terrance Drew was elected as his successor.

On 15 August 2022 he joined the Drew ministry as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

<text>From Time Immemorial: The Origins of the Arab–Jewish Conflict over Palestine is a 1984 book by Joan Peters, published by Harper &amp; Row, about the demographics of the Arab population of Palestine and of the Jewish population of the Arab world before and after the formation of the State of Israel.

It was initially positively received by reviewers such as Barbara W. Tuchman. A short time later, the book&#x27;s central claims were contradicted by Norman Finkelstein, then a PhD student at Princeton University, who argued that Peters misrepresented or misunderstood the statistics on which she based her thesis.

Reputable scholars and reviewers from across the political spectrum have since discredited the central claims of Peters&#x27;s book. By the time the 1985 British edition was reviewed, the book received mixed reviews being regarded by some as wrongheaded at best and fraudulent at worst and by others as groundbreaking. Ian Gilmour, a former British Secretary of State for Defence, ridiculed the book as &quot;pretentious and preposterous&quot; and argued that Peters had repeatedly misrepresented demographic statistics, while Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath called it &quot;sheer forgery&quot;. In 2004, &quot;From Time Immemorial&quot; was the subject of another academic controversy, when Finkelstein accused Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz of largely plagiarizing his book &quot;The Case for Israel&quot; from it.

==Synopsis==
According to Peters, most people who call themselves Palestinians are not actually Palestinians, but instead descendants of recent immigrants from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria, who came to the land in waves of immigration starting in the 19th century and continuing through the period of the British Mandate. She argues that what is referred to as the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight was not ethnic cleansing, but actually a population exchange that resulted from the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

== Reception ==
When the book came out in the US in 1984, it was initially lauded by American writers and public figures including Elie Wiesel, Saul Bellow, Barbara Tuchman, Bernard Lewis, Martin Peretz, Alan Dershowitz, and others. It was—and still is, for some—held as &quot;totemic&quot; on the Jewish right. 

When it came out in the UK in 1985, it was met with a more hostile response, receiving critical reviews from publications such as the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.

The book provoked public debate, but has since been refuted by reputable scholars, in Israel and elsewhere.

===Initial reception===
On its release in the US the book received considerable critical approval. According to Norman Finkelstein, it had garnered some two hundred favorable notices in the United States by the end of its publication in 1984. In April 1985 it was awarded the National Jewish Book Award in the &quot;Israel&quot; category.

Theodore H. White called Peters&#x27; work a &quot;superlative book&quot; that traces Middle East history with &quot;unmatched skill&quot;.

Saul Bellow&#x27;s endorsement on the cover of the book stated:
Every political issue claiming the attention of a world public has its &quot;experts&quot;—news managers, anchor men, ax grinders, and anglers. The great merit of this book is to demonstrate that, on the Palestinian issue, these experts speak from utter ignorance. Millions of people the world over, smothered by false history and propaganda, will be grateful for this clear account of the origins of the Palestinians. From Time Immemorial does not grudge these unhappy people their rights. It does, however, dissolve the claims made by nationalist agitators and correct the false history by which these unfortunate Arabs are imposed upon and exploited.

The book was also praised by Arthur J. Goldberg and Martin Peretz who said: &quot;If (the book is) read, it will change the mind of our generation.&quot; Peretz suggested that there was not a single factual error in the book. Walter Reich wrote on the book &quot;fresh and powerful ... an original analysis as well as a synoptic view of a little-known but important human story&quot;.

Jehuda Reinharz described the book as &quot;valuable synthesis&quot; and &quot;new analysis&quot; that &quot;convincingly demonstrates that many of those who today call themselves Palestinian refugees are former immigrants or children of such immigrants&quot;. Ronald Sanders wrote that Peters&#x27; demographics &quot;could change the entire Arab–Jewish polemic over Palestine&quot;. Sidney Zion wrote that Peters&#x27; book was &quot;the intellectual equivalent of the Six-Day War&quot;. Timothy Foote acclaimed that the book is &quot;part historic primer, part polemic, part revelation, and a remarkable document in itself&quot;. Lucy Dawidowicz wrote that Peters &quot;brought into the light the historical truth about the Mideast&quot;. Barbara Probst Solomon called the book &quot;brilliant, provocative and enlightened&quot;. Elie Wiesel described the &quot;insight and analysis&quot; of the book. Similar views were expressed by Paul Cowan and others.

Some reviewers, while describing the book in favourable terms, did point to some deficiencies in Peters&#x27; scholarship. Martin Kramer in &quot;The New Leader&quot; (May 1984) wrote that the book raises overdue questions about the demographic history of Palestine in a way that cannot be ignored, but also referred to &quot;serious weaknesses&quot; in the book, and Peters&#x27; &quot;rummaging through archives and far more balanced historical studies than her own for whatever evidence she can find to back up her thesis&quot;. He goes on to say that &quot;It is specially unfortunate because on the central point of her book, the demographic argument, Peters is probably right.&quot; Daniel Pipes in &quot;Commentary&quot; (July 1984) initially stated that Peters&#x27; &quot;historical detective work has produced startling results, which should materially influence the future course of the debate about the Palestinian problem.&quot; He did, however, caution readers that &quot;the author is not a historian or someone practiced in writing on politics, and she tends to let her passions carry her away. As a result, the book suffers from chaotic presentation and an excess of partisanship&quot;, and said that critics of her hypothesis should feel obliged to &#x27;make a serious effort to show her wrong by demonstrating that many thousands of Arabs did not emigrate to Palestine in the period under question.&#x27;

Two years later Pipes wrote in a letter to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; explaining positive initial reactions and later academic reviews, with the latter showing technical deficiencies of her book, but adding that Peters&#x27; central thesis, of large-scale Arab immigration into Palestine, had still not been refuted:

&quot;From Time Immemorial&quot; quotes carelessly, uses statistics sloppily, and ignores inconvenient facts. Much of the book is irrelevant to Miss Peters&#x27;s central thesis. The author&#x27;s linguistic and scholarly abilities are open to question. Excessive use of quotation marks, eccentric footnotes, and a polemical, somewhat hysterical undertone mar the book. In short, &quot;From Time Immemorial&quot; stands out as an appallingly crafted book.&lt;br&gt;Granting all this, the fact remains that the book presents a thesis that neither Professor Porath nor any other reviewer has so far succeeded in refuting.

Initially the book received very few unfavorable reviews. According to Norman Finkelstein, by the end of 1984 only three critical reviews had appeared, those by Finkelstein in &quot;In These Times&quot; (September 5–11, 1984), Bill Farrell in the &quot;Journal of Palestine Studies&quot; (Fall 1984) and Alexander Cockburn in &quot;The Nation&quot; (October 13, 1984). Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, professor of religion at Dartmouth College and vice president of the World Jewish Congress remarked that he thought Peters had &quot;cooked the statistics&quot; and that her scholarship was &quot;phony and tendentious&quot;, recycling ideas promoted by right-wing Zionists since the 1930s. Finkelstein claimed that at an international conference on Palestinian demography at Haifa University in Israel in mid 1986, the theses of her book were, citing &quot;Haaretz&quot; as his reference, almost unanimously ridiculed by the participants.

===Criticism===
Peters&#x27; claims in the book have been refuted by reputable scholars.

====Norman Finkelstein====
Norman Finkelstein wrote that Peters&#x27; book was &#x27;among the most spectacular frauds ever published on the Arab-Israeli conflict,&#x27; arguing that its substance was based on extensive plagiarization of a work by Ernst Frankenstein published in the 1940s. His 1984 review was based on his doctoral thesis, later expanded and published in &quot;Image and Reality of the Israel–Palestine Conflict&quot;. Finkelstein went into a close examination of all of Peters&#x27; notes and sources, and argued that her work persistently misrepresented or distorted the primary documents. His systematic critique of the book, attacking the two major pillars of Peters&#x27; thesis, which he regarded as a &#x27;threadbare hoax&#x27; supported by the &#x27;American intellectual establishment&#x27;, had a major impact of later reviews of the book, especially those in Great Britain.

Firstly, in a number of lists, tables and examples Finkelstein juxtaposes the historical evidence Peters presents with extended quotations of the primary and secondary source material showing its original context. By doing so Finkelstein argues that the &quot;evidence that Peters adduces to document massive illegal Arab immigration into Palestine is almost entirely falsified.&quot; For example, Peters cites the Hope Simpson Enquiry as having said that &quot;Egyptian labor is being employed&quot; in supporting her thesis of Arab immigration to Palestine. The actual Hope Simpson Report passage says: &quot;[In Palestine] Egyptian labor is being employed in certain individual cases ...&quot; In another instance, Peters cites the Anglo-American Survey of Palestine as having found that &quot;the &#x27;boom&#x27; conditions in Palestine in the years 1934–1936 led to an inward movement into Palestine, particularly from Syria&quot; when, as Finkelstein demonstrates, the Survey, in the very next sentence, notes that &quot;The depression due to the state of public disorder during 1936–1939 led to the return of these people and also a substantial outward movement of Palestinian Arabs who thought it prudent to live for a time in Lebanon and Syria.&quot;

Secondly, in a detailed analysis of the demographic study central to Peters&#x27; book, Finkelstein argued that Peters&#x27; conclusions are not supported by the data she presents. Finkelstein asserts that the study &quot;is marred by serious flaws: (1) several extremely significant calculations are wrong; and (2) numbers are used selectively to support otherwise baseless conclusions&quot;. His primary contention is that Peters divided up Palestine into five regions for her demographic study to confuse the reader, assigning regions I, II, and IV as Israel and III and V as the West Bank, then claiming that most of the refugees from 1948 had actually emigrated from the West Bank and Gaza (Area V) a year earlier, when Finkelstein argues they just as well could have come from northern Israel (Area IV). Finkelstein&#x27;s deconstruction of the evidential basis for what had become a best-selling book, hailed for its quality by numerous American intellectuals, initially encountered difficulties in securing a publishing venue that might have given his findings a wider airing. In a retrospective reflection he opined that:

The periodicals in which &quot;From Time Immemorial&quot; had already been favorably reviewed refused to run any critical correspondence (e.g. &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;). Periodicals that had yet to review the book rejected a manuscript on the subject as of little or no consequence (e.g. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Dissent&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;). Not a single national newspaper or columnist contacted found newsworthy that a best-selling, effusively praised &quot;study&quot; of the Middle East conflict was a threadbare hoax.

He also said that many of the statistics Peters cited were in Turkish, a language that Peters was unable to read. Finkelstein also mocked as a racist absurdity Peters&#x27;s argument that, because Palestinians ranged so much in skin tone, from fair skinned to dark brown skinned, that they could not be descended from the same land. On the occasion of Peters&#x27; death, Finkelstein, in a long interview with Adam Horowitz, contextualized the thesis and the book&#x27;s reception within Israel&#x27;s emerging image problem after its invasion of Lebanon in 1982.

====Other criticism====
Noam Chomsky defended and promoted Finkelstein&#x27;s critique, commenting in his book &quot;Understanding Power&quot;:
[As] soon as I heard that the book was going to come out in England, I immediately sent copies of Finkelstein&#x27;s work to a number of British scholars and journalists who are interested in the Middle East—and they were ready. As soon as the book [&quot;From Time Immemorial&quot;] appeared, it was just demolished, it was blown out of the water. Every major journal, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, the &quot;London Review&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, everybody had a review saying, this doesn&#x27;t even reach the level of nonsense, of idiocy. A lot of the criticism used Finkelstein&#x27;s work without any acknowledgment, I should say—but about the kindest word anybody said about the book was &quot;ludicrous,&quot; or &quot;preposterous.&quot;

Chomsky recounted that, on its UK release, the book was subject to a number of scathing reviews. David and Ian Gilmour in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; (February 7, 1985) heavily criticized Peters for ignoring Arab sources, and &quot;censorship of Zionist sources that do not suit her case&quot;. They also present examples that in their view show that Peters misuses the sources which she does include in her work. They accuse Peters of basic errors in scholarship, such as the citation of Makrizi, who died in 1442, to support her statements about mid-nineteenth century population movements. Albert Hourani, reviewing the book in &quot;The Observer&quot; (March 3, 1985) stated:

The whole book is written like this: facts are selected or misunderstood, tortuous and flimsy arguments are expressed in violent and repetitive language. This is a ludicrous and worthless book, and the only mildly interesting question it raises is why it comes with praise from two well-known American writers.

Following the book&#x27;s negative reception in the UK, more critical reviews appeared in the United States. Columbia University professor Edward Said wrote unfavorably in &quot;The Nation&quot; (October 19, 1985), while Robert Olson dismissed the book in &quot;The American Historical Review&quot; (April 1985), concluding:

This is a startling and disturbing book. It is startling because, despite the author&#x27;s professed ignorance of the historiography of the Arab-Israeli conflict and lack of knowledge of Middle Eastern history (pp. 221, 335) coupled with her limitation to sources largely in English (absolutely no Arab sources are used), she engages in the rewriting of history on the basis of little evidence. [...] The undocumented numbers in her book in no way allow for the wild and exaggerated assertions that she makes or for her conclusion. This book is disturbing because it seems to have been written for purely polemical and political reasons: to prove that Jordan is the Palestinian state. This argument, long current among revisionist Zionists, has regained popularity in Israel and among Jews since the Likud party came to power in Israel in 1977.

Reviewing the book for the November 28, 1985 issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath described it as a &quot;sheer forgery,&quot; stating, &quot;In Israel, at least, the book was almost universally dismissed as sheer rubbish except maybe as a propaganda weapon.&quot; In 1986, Porath repeated his views in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, and published a negative review that cites many inaccuracies.

William B. Quandt, in the June 1996 edition of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, stated that it had been demonstrated Peters&#x27; claims in the book were based on &quot;shoddy scholarship&quot;. Quandt praises Finkelstein&#x27;s &quot;landmark essay&quot; on the subject, crediting him and other scholars with bringing to light the deficiencies in Peters&#x27; work. In 2005 Israeli historian Avi Shlaim credited Finkelstein with proving that the book was &quot;preposterous and worthless&quot;. Shlaim stated that the evidence adduced by Finkelstein was &quot;irrefutable&quot; and the case he had made against Peters&#x27; book was &quot;unanswerable&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2011, David Remnick described the book as &quot;an ideological tract disguised as history&quot;, &quot;propaganda&quot; and &quot;pseudo-scholarship&quot;. He stated that while the book was a commercial success and had been praised by a number of writers and critics, it had been thoroughly discredited by Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath along with many others. He points out that even some right wing critics who had originally favoured the book later accepted the flaws in its scholarship.

Advocates

Rael Isaac defended the book in &quot;Commentary&quot;, claiming: &quot;Much of Finkelstein&#x27;s malevolent attack is similarly wrong. He incorrectly adds 40,000 Arabs to Miss Peters&#x27;s projections of the number of Arabs who could have been expected, on the basis of natural increase, to live in the Galilee and Negev (what she calls &quot;Area IV&quot;) in 1947, and then accuses her of not accounting for them properly. He charges her with &quot;falsifying&quot; the Anglo-American Survey of Palestine of 1945-46 by claiming that it discloses tens of thousands of Arab illegal immigrants who had been brought into Palestine during the war when in fact (according to Finkelstein) it states only that 3,800 laborers had been brought in. Yet the Survey does list many thousands of laborers who were brought in under official arrangements or came on their own.&quot; Peters was criticized for relying on different sources for establishing the Jewish and non-Jewish population in 1893, but Isaac defended this on the grounds that the Ottoman census would have excluded most Jews as non-citizens, while the figures cited from French geographer Vital Cuinet were likely close to the truth. Isaac conceded that Peters&#x27; attempts to reconstruct the population were tentative and overstated, and acknowledged some errors in the book, but concluded that they did not undermine Peters&#x27; thesis. Isaac also cited Arieh Avneri&#x27;s &quot;The Claim of Dispossession&quot; as further supporting Peters&#x27; claims &quot;with regard both to Arab in-migration and to Arab immigration.&quot;

In an online article entitled, &quot;The Hazards of Making the Case for Israel&quot; Professor Alan Dershowitz, writes:

The Chomsky-Finkelstein-Cockburn mode of ad hominem attack proved particularly successful against Peters because the words &quot;hoax,&quot; &quot;fraud,&quot; &quot;fake,&quot; and &quot;plagiarism&quot; are so dramatic and unforgettable, as is the charge that Peters did not actually write the book. ... It did not seem to matter that none of these charges made by Chomsky, Finkelstein and Cockburn were even close to the truth. All Finkelstein had managed to show was that in a relatively small number of instances, Peters may have misinterpreted some data, ignored counter-data, and exaggerated some findings—common problems in demographic research that often appear in anti-Israel books as well.

Both Alexander Cockburn and Finkelstein have argued that Dershowitz&#x27;s own book on the subject reproduced verbatim some key points of Peters&#x27; research as his own.

====Further debate====
The book, though widely acclaimed when it was issued, came to be regarded with disdain by a number of scholars and historians, whose analyses gave rise to a controversy. In the pages of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in March 1986, Daniel Pipes and Ronald Sanders, two of the book&#x27;s early supporters, engaged in an exchange with Yehoshua Porath, one of its most vehement critics. Pipes gave his overview of the state of the argument, stating Peters&#x27; work had &quot;been received in two ways at two times. Early reviews treated her book as a serious contribution to the study of the Arab-Israeli conflict and late ones dismissed it as propaganda.&quot;

In the exchange both Pipes and Sanders accepted some of the charges that had been leveled at the book. In reference to the harsh criticism, Sanders said that Peters had &quot;brought this upon herself&quot; and acknowledged that &quot;patient researchers have found numerous examples of sloppiness in her scholarship and an occasional tendency not to grasp the correct meaning of a context from which she has extracted a quotation.&quot; Pipes stated that he would not dispute the technical, historical, and literary faults identified by the book&#x27;s critics.

Ronald Sanders argued that all of that does little to undermine the central thesis of Peters:

But the fact remains that there is an original and significant argument at the heart of her book, and this has scarcely been dealt with by critics, apart from Mr. Porath, who only weakly challenged it.
Anthony Lewis, in an opinion piece for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; compared American and Israeli responses to the book:Israelis have not gushed over the book as some Americans have. Perhaps that is because they know the reality of the Palestinians&#x27; existence, as great Zionists of the past knew. Perhaps it is because most understand the danger of trying to deny a people identity. As Professor Porath says, &quot;Neither historiography nor the Zionist cause itself gains anything from mythologizing history.&quot;According to Rael Isaac, &quot;most notices in Israel were favorable, and the book is being published by the Kibbutz Hameuchad—a Labor publishing house—which has assigned it to one of Israel&#x27;s top translators.&quot;

<text>Ralph Everard Gonsalves (born 8 August 1946) is a Vincentian politician who has served as prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the leader of the Unity Labour Party (ULP) since 2001.

Gonsalves is the longest continuously serving Prime Minister since St. Vincent&#x27;s independence is 1979. He became prime minister after his party won a majority government in the 2001 general election. He was the first prime minister from the newly constructed ULP, following a merger of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Labour Party and the Movement for National Unity.

Gonsalves has been Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of North Central Windward since 1994. In 1994, upon the formation of the Unity Labour Party he became deputy leader, and became leader of the party in 1998.

With Gonsalves as leader, the ULP won a majority in the popular vote in every general election from 1998 through 2015, though it failed to secure the majority of parliamentary seats in the 1998 election. In 2020, the ULP won the election, but did not win the popular vote. On 7 November 2020, Gonsalves was sworn in for his fifth term as prime minister.

Gonsalves has been the longest-serving democratically-elected state leader since Samoan PM Tuilaʻepa Saʻilele Malielegaoi was replaced in 2021.

==Early life and education==
Gonsalves, known affectionately as &quot;Comrade Ralph&quot;, was born in Colonarie, Saint Vincent, British Windward Islands to his father, Alban Gonsalves, a farmer and small businessman (now deceased), and his mother, Theresa Francis, a small businesswoman. His ancestors came to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 1845 as indentured servants from the Portuguese island of Madeira.

Gonsalves attended Colonarie Roman Catholic School, and later the St. Vincent Grammar School. He then enrolled at the University of the West Indies, where he completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics. He later returned there to earn a master&#x27;s degree in government, which he completed in 1971. In 1974, he completed a doctorate in government at the University of Manchester. Gonsalves was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in London in 1981. He also attended Makerere University in Uganda according to his address at the United Nations during the Africa Day event on 25 May 2019.

==Political career==

Gonsalves became involved in politics at university, as president of the University of West Indies&#x27; Guild of Undergraduates and Debating Society. In 1968, he led a student protest of the deportation of historian and intellectual Walter Rodney by the Jamaican government.

In 1994, Gonsalves became the deputy leader of the Unity Labour Party. After the resignation of Vincent Beache, Gonsalves became leader of the party in 1998. He was appointed leader of the opposition from December 1999 to January 2001. Gonsalves later led the Unity Labour Party to win the 2001 general election, becoming prime minister and Minister of Finance. His ULP was re-elected in the 2005 general election. In the 2010 general election, Gonsalves and the ULP were narrowly re-elected with 51.11% of the popular vote.
In 2009 Gonsalves and the ULP led a referendum campaign in favour of constitutional reform that would have abolished the country&#x27;s constitutional monarchy, replacing Elizabeth II with a non-executive president. The referendum was defeated, with 55.64% of voters rejecting the changes. Gonsalves has persisted in his calls for the establishment of a presidency, proposing another referendum in 2022 to replace the monarchy while also voicing support to rename places in the country named after colonial figures such as Victoria Park.

In November 2017 Gonsalves gave up the portfolio of Minister of Finance to his son, Camillo Gonsalves.

On 3 July 2020, Gonsalves was elected Chairman of the Caribbean Community succeeding Mia Amor Mottley. His 6-month term ended on 1 January 2021, and he was succeeded by Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister, Keith Rowley.

In November 2020, Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines since 2001, made history by securing the fifth consecutive victory of his Unity Labour Party (ULP) in general election.

Gonsalves attended the coronation of Charles III at Westminster Abbey along with governor-general Susan Dougan on 6 May 2023. Gonsalves met with the King and other leaders of the Commonwealth the day prior.

Gonsalves supports capital punishment.

Gonsalves helped to organize a meeting in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines between Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Guyanese President Irfaan Ali to discuss the 2023 Guyana-Venezuela crisis between the two nations. Gonsalves called on Maduro and Ali &quot;to de-escalate the situation&quot; and engage in &quot;appropriate dialogue&quot;. Also invited to the meeting was Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

==Outside politics==
Gonsalves practices law before the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court. He has written and published on a range of matters including the Caribbean, Africa, trade unionism, comparative political economy, and developmental issues generally.

==Personal life==
Gonsalves has been married twice; currently he is married to Eloise Harris. He has two sons by his first marriage, Camillo and Adam; one son by his second wife, Storm; and two daughters, Isis and Soleil. Camillo followed his father into politics, and is currently serving as Minister of Finance.

On August 5, 2021, at a protest against mandatory vaccination from COVID-19 organized by trade unions representing nurses, police and other workers, Gonsalves was attacked with a projectile near the entrance to Parliament. He sustained visible injuries to his head in the attack. The attack occurred during a large protest against masks and vaccinations in the country. Gonsalves was rushed to the hospital where he was confirmed to be in a stable condition.

<doc id="393754" wikidata="Q57726" url="?curid=393754" title="Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa">
<text>Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa () (24 November 1935 – 11 November 2020) was a Bahraini royal and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Bahrain from 10 January 1970 until his death in 2020. He took office over a year before Bahrain&#x27;s independence on 15 August 1971. At the time of his death, he was the longest-serving prime minister in the world. Under the 2002 Constitution he lost some of his powers, with the King now having the authority to appoint and (along with the Bahraini parliament) dismiss ministers.

Prince Khalifa was also the paternal uncle of the reigning King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and grand-uncle of the Crown Prince Salman, since he was the younger brother of the previous Emir Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa.

==Early life and education==

Prince Khalifa was born on 24 November 1935, the second son of Salman ibn Hamad Al Khalifa, Hakim of Bahrain, and his wife Mouza bint Hamad Al Khalifa. He was educated at Manama High School and the Rifa’a Palace School in Bahrain.

== Career ==
Prince Khalifa was a member of the education council from 1956 to 1958 and chair between 1958 and 1961. Next he became the director of the finance department (1961–1966), president of the electricity board (1961), chair of the Manama municipal council (1962–1967), head of the Bahrain monetary council (1964), chair of the joint committee for economic and financial studies, committee member for the register of commerce, then chairman of the administrative affairs council (1967–1969), became board member of the Bahrain monetary agency and then chairperson of the State Council (1972–1974), head of the State Council (1972), and head of the Supreme Defence Council (1977).

Prince Khalifa was appointed as prime minister by his brother Emir Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, in 1971. Therefore, he was assigned the control of government and economy, while his brother, the Emir, was involved in diplomatic and ceremonial affairs. Prince Khalifa received a World Peace Culture Award on 6 August 2017.

Prince Khalifa is the founder of the Housing Ministry, and he reformed the Central Bank of Bahrain. 
During his premiership he was the head of the Oil and Economic Policy Council.

===Views===
In 2011, reporter Bill Law stated that Prince Khalifa was a hardliner, whereas Crown Prince Salman, his grandnephew who is also deputy prime minister, was a reformer and the King was somewhere in the middle of the two.

==Marriage and children==
Prince Khalifa married his cousin Hessa bint Ali Al Khalifa, the fourth daughter of Ali bin Hamad Al Khalifa in Muharraq. They had three sons and one daughter:
* Mohammad bin Khalifa Al Khalifa (died 1974).
* Ali bin Khalifa Al Khalifa – Former deputy prime minister. He married Zayn bint Khalid Al Khalifa with whom he has three sons and one daughter:
** Khalifa bin Ali Al Khalifa
** Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa
** Minwa bint Ali Al Khalifa
** Khalid bin Ali Al Khalifa
* Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa
* Lulwa bint Khalifa Al Khalifa – honorary president of the Al Noor beneficence society. She married Rashid bin Khalifa Al Khalifa (born 1952), artist and patron of the arts. They have four sons and three daughters.
** Noor bint Rashid Al Khalifa
** Khalifa bin Rashid Al Khalifa
** Hassa bint Rashid Al Khalifa
** Abdulla bin Rashid Al Khalifa
** Aysha bint Rashid Al Khalifa
* Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa (II)

==Death==
Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa experienced various health problems. In September 2019, he went to Germany for treatment, and returned to Bahrain in March 2020. He headed the cabinet for the last time in July 2020 and went to the US for treatment in August 2020.

Al Khalifa died at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota on 11 November 2020 at the age of 84, 13 days before his 85th birthday. Serving 50 years and 11 months in office, he was the longest serving prime minister in the world when he died. His body was flown back to Bahrain on 12 November, where he was buried the following day at Hunainiyah Cemetery in Riffa.

Following his death, Bahraini authorities ordered a seven-day national mourning period with flags half-masted and government institutions closed for three days. Bangladesh observed a day of state mourning on 17 November with flags half-masted.

<doc id="393756" wikidata="Q268776" url="?curid=393756" title="St Johnstone F.C.">
<text>St Johnstone Football Club is a professional association football club in Perth, Scotland. The team competes in the Scottish Premiership, the top division of Scottish football. The club&#x27;s name is derived from St John&#x27;s Toun (or Saint Johnstoun) – an old name of Perth, and the team is nicknamed the &quot;Saints&quot;.

The club was officially founded in 1884, and the team played its first match in February 1885.

Their home since 1989 has been McDiarmid Park; former home venues were the Perth Recreation Grounds and, from 1924 to 1989, Muirton Park.

The team&#x27;s first Scottish Cup appearance was in 1886–87 and they joined the Scottish Football League in 1911–12.

Historically, St Johnstone tended to float between the top two divisions of Scottish football and gained the reputation of being a &quot;yo-yo club&quot;. The team won the Scottish Football League First Division, then the second tier of Scottish league football, in 2008–09, bringing a return of first tier football to McDiarmid Park for the 2009–10 season after a seven-year absence. They have played in the Scottish Premier League, rebranded as the Scottish Premiership in 2013, for fifteen seasons to 2023–24, their longest ever stay in the highest league. St Johnstone&#x27;s traditional rivals are the two Dundee clubs, Dundee and Dundee United, with matches between St Johnstone and either Dundee club being called &quot;Tayside derbies&quot;.

St Johnstone had limited success in cup competitions for the first 130 years of their history, losing at the semi-final stage on numerous occasions, as well as losing two Scottish League Cup finals. In 2014, they won their first Scottish Cup with a 2–0 win against Dundee United. In 2020–21, St Johnstone won their first League Cup and second Scottish Cup to complete a historic Cup double, becoming only the fourth team to achieve the feat. They defeated Livingston 1–0 in the League Cup final and Hibernian 1–0 in the Scottish Cup final.

They have also won the Scottish second tier seven times, the Scottish Challenge Cup in 2007, the B Division Supplementary Cup in 1949 and the Scottish Consolation Cup in 1911 and 1914. They have qualified for European competitions in seven seasons, including four consecutively from 2013 to 2016. Their highest league position in the top division is third place on three occasions: 1971, 1999 and 2013.

==History==
===Origins===
St Johnstone FC was formed by members of a local cricket club seeking ways to occupy their time and keep fit once the cricket season had finished. The cricketers were kicking a football around the South Inch, a large public park beside the River Tay during the autumn of 1884. This is widely acknowledged to be the date of the formation of St Johnstone Football Club, although it was not until early in the following year that a group of footballers, led by John Colborn, held an official meeting that led to the formation of the football club as a separate entity rather than a &#x27;spin-off&#x27; from the cricket club.

Football was becoming increasingly popular in Scotland and, although there were other local clubs including Fair City Athletic, Erin Rovers and Caledonian Rangers (based at Perth railway station), it was St Johnstone that became the one most associated with the town. The name is traced back to the Middle Ages when Perth was colloquially known as &#x27;St John&#x27;s Toun&#x27; (or &#x27;Saint Johnstoun&#x27;) as the church at the centre of the parish was dedicated to St John the Baptist. Agnus Dei (The Lamb of God), the symbol associated with John the Baptist, forms part of St Johnstone&#x27;s club badge.

Club members leased a piece of land adjacent to the South Inch, known as the Recreation Grounds, which became St Johnstone&#x27;s first home ground. After several decades – and regular problems with flooding – it became clear they had outgrown the venue and so, in 1924, they moved to the other side of Perth and built Muirton Park, which would serve as their home for the next 65 years.

===1886 to 1972===
St Johnstone made their debut appearance in the Scottish Cup in the 1886–87 tournament but were defeated 7–1 in a first round replay by the Erin Rovers club, also based in Perth, after a 3–3 draw at home. In the 1910–11 Scottish Division Two season, Port Glasgow Athletic F.C. finished next to bottom and declined to apply for re-election. They were replaced for the 1911–12 Scottish Division Two season by St Johnstone, who finished fifth in their first season with ten wins and eight defeats.

St Johnstone were promoted to the old First Division in 1924–25, by winning the Second Division title, and appointed David Taylor as team manager. They remained in the top flight until 1929–30 when they finished bottom of Division One. Two years later, under new manager Tommy Muirhead, the Saints were runners-up in Division Two to gain their second promotion. They performed well in Division One through the 1930s, reaching the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup in 1933–34 and finishing fifth in 1932–33 and 1934–35. In the final season before World War II, St Johnstone played well under manager David Rutherford to finish eighth.

The Scottish Football League suspended competition for the duration of the war but sixteen clubs were able to form a regional Southern Football League that managed to operate each season. St Johnstone were closed for most of the war and lost their top flight status as a result. The Southern Football League continued through the post-war 1945–46 season but with two divisions to incorporate clubs that were restarting, including St Johnstone. The Saints played in the 1945–46 B Division and finished sixth of fourteen clubs. When the Scottish League restarted in 1946, the Southern League set-up was used as the first post-war competition, so the A Division became the new First Division and the B Division the new Second Division. St Johnstone had lost all the ground gained in the 1930s and could only finish ninth in Division Two in 1946–47.

Jimmy Crapnell became the team manager for the 1947–48 season and was succeeded by Johnny Pattillo for 1953–54. The Saints remained in the Second Division throughout the tenures of these two managers. Bobby Brown took over in the summer of 1958 and, in his second season 1959–60, the club finally won promotion again. Brown and his successor Willie Ormond both managed Scotland after leaving St Johnstone. In 1970–71, under Ormond, Saints finished third in the league and qualified for the 1971–72 UEFA Cup.

===Cup Competitions===
The club historically has had little success in national competitions. Prior to winning the Scottish Cup in 2014 their only cup successes were limited to successes in the Consolation Cup – a competition for clubs knocked out of early rounds of the Scottish Cup – in 1911 and 1914. The club have appeared twice in the Scottish Challenge Cup final, losing 1–0 to Stranraer in 1996, and winning the trophy in 2007 with a 3–2 victory over Dunfermline. Saints&#x27; Scottish Cup win came after seven semi-final appearances dating back to 1934. They have never won the top league. There were two appearances in the final of the League Cup, losing first to Celtic 1–0 in 1969 and 2–1 to Rangers in 1998, with Canadian internationalist Nick Dasovic scoring for &quot;Saints&quot;.
In 2020–21, St Johnstone won their first League Cup and second Scottish Cup to complete a historic Cup double, becoming only the fourth team to achieve the feat. They defeated Livingston 1–0 in the League Cup final and Hibernian 1–0 in the Scottish Cup final. Defender Shaun Rooney headed the winner in both matches.

===Willie Ormond era===
In terms of the league, the club&#x27;s highest-ever finish has been third place in the old First Division, which has occurred on three occasions. The first was in 1970–71, when &quot;Saints&quot; finished behind Celtic and Aberdeen but ahead of Rangers. The team was mostly the 1969 League Cup team, managed by Willie Ormond, who eventually went on to manage Scotland. The club had some notable players during this period, who later went on to success at other clubs, e.g. Henry Hall, Alex MacDonald, John Lambie, John Connolly, and Jim Pearson.

This third-placed finish led to a European adventure in the UEFA Cup, beating German giants Hamburger SV and Hungarians Vasas SC before finally going out in Yugoslavia to FK Željezničar Sarajevo. The club continued to play in the top division of the Scottish Football League until reconstruction in 1975, but were relegated from the new Premier Division in its first season, and turned part-time for the first time since 1961.

McDiarmid Park&#x27;s south stand is named the Ormond Stand in his honour.

===Relegations and rebuilding===
It took &quot;Saints&quot; until 1983 to return to the top flight – albeit for a single season and as part-time team – before setting a record through suffering two successive relegations in 1984 and 1985. They eventually found themselves bottom of the entire league in 1986 and skirted with financial oblivion, before local businessman Geoff Brown stepped in.

An unprecedented change in the club&#x27;s focus occurred over the next decade or so, with the move from long-term home Muirton Park to the new purpose-built McDiarmid Park on the outskirts of the city, the first purpose-built all-seater stadium built in the United Kingdom. The new stadium was named to recognise the donation of land by local farmer Bruce McDiarmid. This plus the input of significant transfer funds and the appointment of manager Alex Totten spurred &quot;Saints&quot; through the leagues. They obtained promotion to the First Division in 1988. &quot;Saints&quot; then won the First Division championship and promotion to the Premier Division in 1990 during the first season of football at McDiarmid Park. After 15 years as a semi-professional outfit, the club turned full-time again when promotion was achieved.

&quot;Saints&quot; finished 1990–91 in 7th place, but their season was buoyed by an appearance in the Scottish Cup semi-finals, in which they lost to Dundee United.

The following season proved to be Totten&#x27;s last at the helm, an eighth-placed finish bringing to an end his five-year reign as manager. He was succeeded by John McClelland for the 1992–93 season. The Northern Irishman didn&#x27;t fare much better, however, leading the club to 6th place. Another semi-finals cup appearance, this time the League Cup, sweetened the campaign slightly.

St Johnstone&#x27;s four-year run in the Premier Division came to an end in 1993–94, a 10th-placed finish sending them back to the First Division. McClelland left the club before the season ended, and was replaced by former Dundee United striker Paul Sturrock.

===Success in the 1990s===
Under Sturrock&#x27;s stewardship, more emphasis was placed on the club rearing its own players. This bore fruit in the form of Callum Davidson and Danny Griffin. Sturrock also introduced – at least in principle – the concept of morning and afternoon training sessions in an attempt to raise the fitness level of his players. In Sturrock&#x27;s first full season in charge, &quot;Saints&quot; finished 5th in the First Division and reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup. In 1995–96, he led them to fourth place and a Scottish Cup quarter-final. League success returned in 1996–97 with the First Division championship and a return to the top flight. The club more than held their own in the first season back. Their 5th-placed finish meant they became founder members of the SPL the following season.

Although Sturrock soon left for Dundee United, the club found a second &#x27;golden period&#x27; in 1998–99 under new manager Sandy Clark, when the club finished third in the SPL behind Rangers and Celtic. &quot;Saints&quot; also reached the final of the League Cup and the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup in that season, losing to Rangers in both competitions. They lost to Rangers in five of the six meetings between the two clubs that season (including a 7–0 home defeat), but &quot;Saints&quot; won 3–1 in the other game. Their finishing position in the league meant &quot;Saints&quot; had qualified for the 1999–00 UEFA Cup campaign. They started with a 3–1 aggregate win in the qualifying round over Finnish side VPS Vaasa, but were beaten 6–3 on aggregate by French giants AS Monaco in the first round proper. The return leg meant that international stars such as Fabien Barthez, John Arne Riise and David Trezeguet played at McDiarmid Park. St Johnstone remained unbeaten at home in European competitions until their tie against FC Minsk in 2013.

===The new millennium===

After a period of steady decline, the club were eventually relegated from the Premier League in 2002. Clark&#x27;s replacement, Billy Stark, oversaw this relegation, and left the club in 2004 after two seasons of varying success. With the club in eighth place after a poor 2004–05 season under Stark&#x27;s replacement, John Connolly, Owen Coyle took charge in April 2005, ushering in a promising new period in which St Johnstone earned second-place finishes in 2005–06 and 2006–07.

There was also cup success under Coyle. On 8 November 2006, St Johnstone beat Rangers 2–0 at Ibrox to reach the semi-finals of the League Cup. Steven Milne scored both of the goals. This was the club&#x27;s first victory at Ibrox since April 1971. It was also the first time the club beat Rangers in a cup competition, and the first time that Rangers had been eliminated from a major cup competition at home by lower-division opposition. On 31 January 2007, &quot;Saints&quot; were knocked out of the League Cup at the semi-finals stage by Hibs. On 14 April 2007, St Johnstone were beaten 2–1 by Celtic at Hampden in the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup. By then Coyle&#x27;s name was being linked with managerial vacancies in the SPL. On 21 April 2007, second-placed &quot;Saints&quot; won 3–0 at home to Queen of the South, while table-toppers Gretna played out a goalless draw against the visiting Clyde, which put the Perth club just one point (and seven goals) behind Gretna. As a result, the First Division championship was to be decided on the final day of the season. Seven days later, St Johnstone were pipped to the First Division championship by Gretna, who had led the division for the majority of the season. &quot;Saints&quot; won 4–3 at Hamilton Academical, but James Grady scored an injury-time winner for Gretna at Ross County minutes after the St Johnstone game had finished. The results maintained Gretna&#x27;s one-point lead and they achieved promotion to the Premier League under former &quot;Saints&quot; player Davie Irons.

Owen Coyle left the club on 22 November 2007, to become manager of English club Burnley. &quot;Saints&quot; next game, the Challenge Cup Final against Dunfermline three days later, saw them win their first cup since the Scottish Consolation Cup of 1911, with a 3–2 victory. St Johnstone midfielder Derek McInnes was appointed as Coyle&#x27;s replacement as manager on 27 November 2007, after Coyle&#x27;s assistant, Sandy Stewart, who had been in charge in a caretaker-manager capacity for the Challenge Cup Final, decided to follow Coyle south to Burnley. McInnes began as a player-manager. Results to the end of 2007 continued the indifferent form shown under Coyle, leaving St Johnstone in third place, some way behind the leaders. In 2008 the club did, however, reach the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup for the second consecutive season, losing out to Rangers on penalties after extra time. It was the club&#x27;s seventh appearance in the semi-finals, and their seventh defeat.

On 2 May 2009, &quot;Saints&quot; beat Greenock Morton 3–1 at McDiarmid Park to clinch the First Division title and a return to the Premier League after a seven-year absence. They finished eighth in their first season back.

In November 2011, on the same day the club announced the appointment of manager Steve Lomas, it was also announced that club chairman Geoff Brown, the longest-serving chairman in Scottish football, was retiring and therefore stepping down from his post. His son, Steve, was handed control of the club. In June 2013 Steve Lomas left the club to manage Millwall and Tommy Wright was appointed as his replacement. In his first competitive game in charge, Wright lead St Johnstone to a 1–0 victory against Rosenborg BK in Norway. This was the club&#x27;s first away win in Europe in over 40 years.

=== The Golden Age: Tommy Wright, Callum Davidson and Cup glory ===
On 13 April 2014, St Johnstone reached their first-ever Scottish Cup Final, after defeating Aberdeen 2–1 in the semi-final at Ibrox Stadium. They won the final against Tayside rivals Dundee United on 17 May, 2–0 at Celtic Park.

The club won its second major cup seven years later, defeating Livingston 1–0 in the February 2021 Scottish League Cup final. Shaun Rooney scored the only goal of the game. Later that season, St Johnstone won its second Scottish Cup, defeating Hibernian 1–0, with Shaun Rooney again scoring the only goal of the game in the 32nd minute, the same time as his winner in the League Cup Final. This victory meant St Johnstone had become the first team outside of the Old Firm to win a cup double since Aberdeen in 1990, and beating 10,000/1 odds to do so. St Johnstone also qualified for Europe for the sixth time in ten seasons, having only qualified twice before in their history.

==European record==
St Johnstone have qualified for the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup) on eight occasions. The furthest they have progressed is the third round, which occurred in 1971–72, their debut season in the tournament.

<doc id="393758" wikidata="Q1571033" url="?curid=393758" title="Haliburton County">
<text>Haliburton is a county of Ontario, Canada, known as a tourist and cottage area in Central Ontario for its scenery and for its resident artists. Minden Hills is the county seat. Haliburton County and the village of Haliburton are named after Thomas Chandler Haliburton, author, statesman, and the first chairman of the Canadian Land and Emigration Company.

The county borders Algonquin Provincial Park on the north.

==History==
It was originally organized in 1874 as the Provisional County of Haliburton. The county&#x27;s economy has historically been based on the lumber industry, with the first sawmill officially opening on December 18, 1864. The Canadian Land and Emigration Company later opened in the 1870s and operated until 1892. A third sawmill was constructed in 1903 by the William Laking Lumber Company. All three of these mills were constructed on the Drag River, an important river in the county in the center of Haliburton Village used to send lumber downstream. The county was created from townships that were withdrawn from other counties and districts, including:

It became Haliburton County in 1983, and consists of the following municipalities:

:* Township of Algonquin Highlands
:* Municipality of Dysart et al (Dysart, Bruton, Clyde, Dudley, Eyre, Guilford, Harburn, Harcourt and Havelock)
:* Municipality of Highlands East
:* Township of Minden Hills

Communities in the county include Haliburton, Dorset, Minden, Wilberforce, Gooderham, Irondale, Cardiff, West Guilford, Eagle Lake and Fort Irwin.

==Geography==
Haliburton County is dubbed the &quot;Haliburton Highlands&quot;. The Haliburton Highlands region is also one of the higher points on the Canadian Shield, ranging from at the Haliburton/Stanhope Municipal Airport to above sea level at Sir Sam&#x27;s Ski Resort in Eagle Lake.

===Lakes===
Haliburton County is spotted with many rivers and lakes, including endorheic lakes fed by natural springs. Some of the major lakes are as follows:

==Economy==
Haliburton County&#x27;s economy is dominated by tourism. The ratio of properties occupied in the summer months, to properties occupied year-round is about 3 to 1. Employment primarily caters to the needs of this seasonal cottage country population, including residential construction, resorts, services and retail. One particularly successful resort at the time was the Wigamog Inn Resort. Years ago it catered to hundreds staying on site during the summer months, and was a prime location being only a minutes walk from the lake. It closed permanently around 2009 - 2010, with a new owner buying the property in 2016.

The Haliburton County Development Corporation (HCDC) is currently working on a project called Innovative Haliburton to bring attention to the creative economy in Haliburton, as well as, partnering with HCDC to advance the creative economy in eastern Ontario. In 2009, HCDC formed a creative economy committee to look at ways to: encourage innovative people who already have an attachment to the area to move and run their business here, support new and existing businesses in the county that work in the creative economy, showcase local businesses that are successfully engaged in the creative economy, and support our local governments to engage in planning that will help attract new businesses. In 2013, The Creative Economy Committee&#x27;s name was changed to the Economic Innovations Committee to better describe the roles of the committee as a seed organization, helping the county to prosper through innovation and enabling the youth of the county to better understand the opportunities that are being created in the new economy.

The county is serviced by hospitals in Haliburton and Minden; both are administered by Haliburton Highlands Health Services.

Many local artists are involved in the school as part-time faculty. The Haliburton Campus also offers a post-graduate certificate in expressive arts. The campus also has an emphasis on eco-friendly education and offers certificates in sustainable building and construction, and in sustainable renovation. The sustainable building and construction program was the first of its kind in Canada and its success has had a positive impact locally, as the programs have built the R.D. Lawrence Place at the Minden Hills Cultural Centre, the 4Cs Thrift Store in Haliburton, the Kinark Outdoor Centre in Minden and, in the summer of 2013, the new Library in Wilberforce. The renovation program revitalized the Haliburton Highlands Museum.

==Forest fire protection history==
The former Dysart fire tower was erected in 1956 on a hill by the east side of Haliburton village just off Highway 118. Its frame still stands, but the towerman&#x27;s cupola has since been removed. It was erected by Ontario&#x27;s former &quot;Department of Lands and Forests&quot; (now the MNR) as an early detection to protect the local forests from fire. This tower was put out of use in the late 1960s when aerial detection systems were put in place. It was one of the County of Haliburton&#x27;s many towers that were part of the former &quot;Lindsay Forest Fire District&quot;. Other towers included: Harburn, Eyre, Green&#x27;s Mountain, Harvey, Cardiff, Digby, Lutterworth, Sherbourne (St. Nora), Dorset, and Bruton. When a fire was spotted in the forest a towerman would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a &#x27;triangulation&#x27; read and plot the exact location of the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. There were Department of Lands and Forests headquarters stations in Minden, Ontario and at St. Nora Lake (later the Leslie Frost Centre), which offered forest ranger training from 1945 onwards.

<text>The South African Chess Championship was first organised in 1892 by the Cape Town Chess Club. It is now organised by Chess South Africa (CHESSA), the governing body of chess in South Africa. The tournament is normally held every two years. It is restricted to chess players resident in South Africa (although exceptions have been made on occasion) and participation is by invitation only.

CHESSA was formed in 1992, after unification talks between various chess bodies that commenced the previous year. The 1995 event, the first organised by CHESSA, included titled players from Angola and Zimbabwe and was run on the Swiss system. Since that date, the tournament has been held on a round-robin basis. The winner of the tournament holds the title of South African Closed Chess Champion until the next tournament is held.

Historically, the tournament was usually held on a round-robin or double round-robin basis. In case of a tie for first place, a playoff match was usually conducted. In the early days, the title holder could also be challenged to a title match, and these matches are tabled below.

<doc id="393763" wikidata="Q234814" url="?curid=393763" title="Khaleda Zia">
<text>Begum Khaleda Zia (born August–September 1945) is a Bangladeshi politician, who served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006. She was the first female prime minister of Bangladesh and second female prime minister in the Muslim world, after Benazir Bhutto. She is the widow of one of the former presidents of Bangladesh, Ziaur Rahman. She is the chairperson and leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) since 1984, which was founded by her husband in 1978.

Born in a Muslim family in Jalpaiguri, Khaleda came to national attention as the First Lady of Bangladesh after her husband Rahman became the president in 1977. After Rahman&#x27;s assassination in 1981, Khaleda joined politics and came to lead the BNP. After a military coup in 1982, led by former army chief Lieutenant general Hussain Muhammad Ershad, She helped lead the movement for democracy until the fall of Ershad in 1990. She became the prime minister following the victory of BNP in the 1991 general election. She also served briefly in the short-lived government in 1996, when other parties had boycotted the first election because of election fraud accusations. In the next round of general elections of 1996, the Awami League under Sheikh Hasina came to power. Her party came to power again in 2001. She has been elected to five separate parliamentary constituencies in the general elections of 1991, June 1996 and 2001. Since the 1980s, Zia&#x27;s chief rival has been Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina. Since 1991, they have been the only two serving as the prime minister of Bangladesh.

Following the end of her government&#x27;s term in 2006, the scheduled January 2007 elections were delayed due to political violence and in-fighting, resulting in a bloodless military takeover of the caretaker government. During its interim rule, it charged Zia and her two sons with corruption. Bangladesh was the most corrupt country in the world according to Corruption Perceptions Index during her second tenure from 2001 to 2006. In its list of the 100 Most Powerful Women in the World, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Zia at number 14 in 2004, number 29 in 2005, and number 33 in 2006.

Zia was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison for the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case and Zia Charitable Trust corruption case in 2018. A local court handed her the verdict for abusing power as the prime minister while disbursing a fund in favor of newly formed Zia Orphanage Trust. Referring to the international and domestic legal experts, the U.S. State Department in its 2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices opined that &quot;Lack of evidence to support the conviction&quot; suggests the case was a political ploy to remove her from the electoral process. Amnesty International raised concerns that her &quot;fair trial rights are not respected&quot;. Zia was facing a total 36 cases against her including the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption Case and Zia Charitable Trust corruption case. On 27 November 2024, Zia was acquitted in these graft cases.

Zia was transferred to a hospital for medical treatment in April 2019. In March 2020, she was released for six months on humanitarian grounds with the conditions that she would stay at her home in Gulshan, Dhaka and not travel abroad. She is also informally prohibited from making political moves, as doing so would result in re-imprisonment. In September 2022, the 6-month period suspension of her sentence was granted for the sixth consecutive time. She remained in Dhaka Central Jail from 2018 to 2020 and later conditionally freed for medical treatment until 5 August 2024, after a mass uprising resulted in incumbent prime minister Hasina fleeing to India and the Bangladesh President issuing a release order of Zia.

==Personal life and family==
===Early life and education===
Khaleda Khanam &quot;Putul&quot; was born in 1945 in Jalpaiguri in the then undivided Dinajpur District in Bengal Presidency, British India (now in Jalpaiguri District, India) but her ancestral home is in Fulgazi, Feni She was the third of five children of tea-businessman father Iskandar Ali Majumder, who was from Fulgazi, Feni District and mother Taiyaba Majumder, who was from Chandbari (now in Uttar Dinajpur District). According to her father, after the partition of India in 1947, they migrated to Dinajpur town (now in Bangladesh). Khaleda describes herself as &quot;self-educated&quot; and there are no records of her graduating from high school; Initially, she attended Dinajpur Missionary School and later Dinajpur Girls&#x27; School. In 1960, she married Ziaur Rahman, then a captain in the Pakistan Army. After marriage, she changed her name to Khaleda Zia, by taking her husband&#x27;s first name as her surname. She reportedly enrolled in Surendranath College in Dinajpur, but moved to West Pakistan to stay with her husband in 1965. Her husband was deployed as an army officer during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. In March 1969, the couple shifted back to East Pakistan. Due to Rahman&#x27;s posting in the army, the family then moved to Chittagong.

===Family===

Zia&#x27;s first son, Tarique Rahman (b. 1967), got involved into politics and went on to become the acting chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Her second son, Arafat Rahman &quot;Koko&quot; (b. 1969), died of a cardiac arrest in 2015. Zia&#x27;s sister, Khurshid Jahan (1939–2006) served as the Minister of Women and Children Affairs during 2001–2006. Her younger brother, Sayeed Iskander (1953–2012), was also a politician who served as a Jatiya Sangsad member from the Feni-1 constituency during 2001–2006. Her second brother, Shamim Iskandar, is a retired flight engineer of Bangladesh Biman. Her second sister is Selina Islam.

==Involvement in politics==

On 30 May 1981, Khaleda Zia&#x27;s husband, the-then President of Bangladesh Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated. After his death, on 2 January 1982, she got involved into politics by first becoming a member of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – the party, which was founded by Rahman. She took charge of the vice-chairman position in March 1983.

==Anti-Ershad Movement==
In March 1982, the then chief of Bangladesh Army, Hussain Muhammad Ershad forced Bangladesh&#x27;s BNP President Justice Abdus Sattar to resign and become the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) of the country. This marked the beginning of a nine-year-long military dictatorship in Bangladesh.

===BNP and 7 party alliance===

Begum Khaleda Zia, from the first day of Ershad&#x27;s rule, protested the military dictatorship and had a very uncompromising stance. She became the Senior Vice-President of BNP by May 1983. Under her active leadership, BNP started discussing the possibilities of a unified movement with six other parties on 12 August 1983 and formed a &#x27;7 party alliance&#x27; by the first week of September 1983. BNP, led by Khaleda Zia also reached an action-based agreement with other political parties to launch a movement against Ershad.

On 30 September 1983, Begum Khaleda Zia led the first major public rally in front of the party office and was hailed by the party workers. On 28 November 1983, she took part in the &quot;gherao movement&quot; (encircling) of the Secretariat building at Dhaka along with the alliance leaders, which was quelled by Ershad&#x27;s ruthless police force and she was put under house arrest on the same day.

Due to the deteriorating health conditions, Justice Abdus Sattar resigned from the position of BNP chief on 13 January 1984 and was replaced by Begum Khaleda Zia who was then the Senior Vice President of the party. In May 1984, she was elected as the chairperson of the party in a council by the councilors.

After assuming the position of party chief, Khaleda Zia spearheaded the movement against Ershad. In 1984, along with other parties, she declared 6 February as the &#x27;Demand Day&#x27; and 14 February as &#x27;Protest Day&#x27;. Country-wide rallies were organized on those days and activists of the movement died on the streets fighting the ruthless police force loyal to President Ershad.

The 7-party alliance held a countrywide &#x27;Mass Resistance Day&#x27; on 9 July 1984, In support of their demand for the immediate withdrawal of Martial Law, the opposition forces called the countrywide gherao and demonstrations from 16 to 20 September and a full day hartal on 27 September 1984.

The protests continued in 1985 as well and as a result, in March of the same year, Ershad-led government tightened the grip of martial law and put Begum Khaleda Zia under house arrest.

===Boycotting 1986 election===

To divert the political pressure, Lt. General Ershad declared a date for a fresh election in 1986. Initially, the two major opposition alliances, &#x27;7 party alliance&#x27; led by BNP and &#x27;15 party alliance&#x27; led by Awami League discussed the possibilities of participating in the election forming a greater election alliance to catch Ershad off the guard. But Awami League refused to form any election alliance and Sheikh Hasina in a public rally declared anyone who would join the election under Ershad would be a &#x27;national traitors&#x27;, on 19 March 1986.

However, Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s Awami League, along with Communist Party of Bangladesh and six other parties, joined the election under Ershad, resulting in the split between the 15 party alliance, On the other hand, Begum Khaleda Zia uncompromisingly declared the election illegal and urged people to resist the election.

The government of Ershad put her under house arrest on the eve of the election while Awami League, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, Communist Party of Bangladesh and other smaller parties took part in the election only to lose to the Jatiya Party of Ershad.

Begum Khaleda Zia&#x27;s uncompromising attitude and her defiance to the military dictatorship made an image of an &quot;Uncompromising leader&quot; in the eyes of people. Gowher Rizvi in his analysis wrote:

Later in that year, on the eve of 1986 Bangladeshi presidential election, Khaleda Zia was put under house arrest once again.

===Fall of Ershad===
Khaleda Zia was put under house arrest multiple times from 1986 to 1990 by Ershad&#x27;s military government.

On 13 October 1986, she was put under house arrest right before the 1986 Bangladeshi presidential election and was released only after the election. She took the lead on her release and initiated a fresh movement with a view to deposing Ershad. She called a half-day strike on 10 November of the same year only to be put under house arrest again.

On 24 January 1987, when Sheikh Hasina joined the parliament session with other Awami League leaders, Khaleda Zia was on the street demanding the dissolution of the parliament. She called for a mass rally in Dhaka which turned violent and top leaders of BNP were arrested. After that, a series of strikes were organized by 7 party alliance led by Khaleda Zia from February to July 1987. On 22 October of the year, Khaleda Zia&#x27;s BNP in collaboration with Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s Awami League declared &quot;Dhaka Seize&quot; programme on 10 November to overthrow Ershad.

As a countermeasure, Ershad&#x27;s government rounded up thousands of political leaders and activists, but on the day of seizing there were complete chaos on the streets and dozens died. The government of Ershad put Khaleda Zia under house arrest after detaining her from Purbani Hotel, from where she was coordinating the movement. On 11 December 1987, Khaleda was set free but she immediately held a press conference and claimed that, she was &quot;prepared to die&quot; to depose the dictator.

After the eventful 1987, two following years went relatively calm with sporadic violence. A fresh wave of movements started when BNP&#x27;s student wing Chatra Dal started winning most of the student union elections across the country. By 1990, Chatra Dal took control of 270 out of 321 student unions of the country, riding on the popularity of Khaleda Zia. They also won all the posts of Dhaka University Central Students&#x27; Union in 1990. The new committee of DUCSU led by Amanullah Aman declared fresh programmes to overthrow Ershad in line with BNP&#x27;s programmes. On 10 October 1990, in a violent turn of events Chatra Dal leader Naziruddin Jehad died on the street of Dhaka that paved the way for a greater alliance between all the opposition forces.

After two-month-long protests, the BNP led by Khaleda Zia, along with other political parties, compelled Ershad to offer his resignation on 4 December 1990.

==Premiership==

Begum Khaleda Zia served as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh for three times. Her first term was from March 1991 to February 1996, second term lasted for a few weeks after February 1996 and third term was from October 2001 to October 2006. She is particularly remembered for her role in making education accessible and introducing some key economic reforms.

===First term===

A neutral caretaker government in Bangladesh oversaw elections on 27 February 1991 following eight years of Ershad presidency. BNP won 140 seats – 11 short of simple majority. Zia was sworn in as the country&#x27;s first female prime minister on 20 March 1991 with the support of a majority of the deputies in parliament. The acting president Shahabuddin Ahmed granted Zia nearly all of the powers that were vested in the president at the time, effectively returning Bangladesh to a parliamentary system. With a unanimous vote, the parliament passed the 12th amendment to the constitution in August 1991, formally ending 16 years of presidential rule.

====Educational reforms====

When Begum Khaleda Zia took charge in 1991, Bangladeshi children received about two years of education on average, and for every three boys, there was one girl studying in the same classroom. Begum Khaleda Zia promoted education and vocational training very aggressively. Her government made primary education free and mandatory for all. Education was made free for girls until the 10th grade.

To fund the implementation of new reforms and policies, in 1994, the education budget was increased by 60%, the highest allocation amongst the formal budget sectors.

In 1990, only 31.73% students passed in the SSC examination and the rate was 30.11% for female. In 1995, thanks to her policies, 73.2% students passed the SSC examination and among the female students, 71.58% passed.

====Economic reforms====

Some of the major economic reforms marked the First Khaleda Zia government, that included the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT), formulation of Bank Company Act in 1991 and Financial Institutions Act in 1993, and the establishment of privatization board in 1993. Besides, Bangladesh signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1993.

A new export processing zone was established near Dhaka in 1993 to attract foreign investors.

====Administrative reforms====

The First Khaleda Zia government, to address popular demand, passed a law to allow the mayors of city corporations to be elected directly by the voters. Before that, the elected ward councilors of each ward of the city corporation used to elect the mayor of the city.

Zia&#x27;s administration abolished the Upazila system in November 1991. It formed the Local Government Structure Review Commission, which recommended a two-tier system of local government, district and union councils. Also the Thana Development and Coordination Committee was formed to coordinate development activities at the thana level.

===Second term===

When the opposition boycotted the 15 February 1996 election, Zia&#x27;s party BNP had a landslide victory in the 6th Jatiya Sangshad. Other major parties demanded a neutral caretaker government to be appointed to oversee the elections. The short-lived parliament hastily introduced the caretaker government by passing the 13th amendment to the constitution. The parliament was dissolved to pave the way for parliamentary elections within 90 days.

In the 12 June 1996 elections, BNP lost to Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s Awami League. Winning 116 seats, BNP emerged as the largest opposition party in the country&#x27;s parliamentary history.

===Third term===

The BNP formed a four-party alliance on 6 January 1999 to increase its chances to return to power in the next general elections. These included its former political foe the Jatiya Party, founded by President Ershad after he led a military government, and the Islamic parties of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and the Islami Oikya Jot. It encouraged protests against the ruling Awami League.

Many residents strongly criticized Zia and BNP for allying with Jamaat-e-Islami, which had opposed the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. The four-party alliance participated in the 1 October 2001 general elections, winning two-thirds of the seats in parliament and 46% of the vote (compared to the principal opposition party&#x27;s 40%). Zia was sworn in as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

She worked on a 100-day programme to fulfill most of her election pledges to the nation. During this term, the share of domestic resources in economic development efforts grew. Bangladesh began to attract a higher level of international investment for development of the country&#x27;s infrastructure, energy resources and businesses, including from the United States, Great Britain, and Japan. Restoration of law and order was an achievement during the period.

Zia promoted neighbourly relations in her foreign policy. In her &quot;look-east policy&quot;, she worked to bolster regional cooperation in South Asia and adherence to the UN Charter of Human Rights. She negotiated settlement of international disputes, and renounced the use of force in international relations. Bangladesh began to participate in United Nations international peacekeeping efforts. In 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine featured her administration in a major story praising her achievements. Her government worked to educate young girls (nearly 70% of Bangladeshi women were illiterate) and distribute food to the poor (half of Bangladesh&#x27;s 135 million people lived below the poverty line). Her government promoted strong GDP growth (5%) based on economic reforms and support of an entrepreneurial culture.

When Zia became prime minister for the third time, the GDP growth rate of Bangladesh remained above 6 percent. The Bangladesh per capita national income rose to 482 dollars. Foreign exchange reserve of Bangladesh had crossed 3 billion dollars from the previous 1 billion dollars. The foreign direct investments of Bangladesh had risen to 2.5 billion dollars. The industrial sector of the GDP had exceeded 17 percent at the end of Zia&#x27;s office.

On 29 October 2006, Zia&#x27;s term in office ended. In accordance with the constitution, a caretaker government would manage in the 90-day interim before general elections. On the eve of the last day, rioting broke out on the streets of central Dhaka due to uncertainty over, who would become Chief Advisor (head of the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh). Under the constitution, the immediate past Chief Justice was to be appointed. But, Chief Justice Khondokar Mahmud Hasan (K M Hasan) declined the position. President Iajuddin Ahmed, as provided for in the constitution, assumed power as Chief Advisor on 29 October 2006. He tried to arrange elections and bring all political parties to the table during months of violence; 40 people were killed and hundreds injured in the first month after the government&#x27;s resignation in November 2006.
Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury, the presidential advisor, met with Zia and Sheikh Hasina, and other political parties to try to resolve issues and schedule elections. Negotiations continued against a backdrop of political bickering, protests and polarisation that threatened the economy. Officially on 26 December 2006, all political parties joined the planned 22 January 2007 elections. The Awami League pulled out at the last minute, and in January, the military intervened to back the caretaker government for a longer interim period. It held power until holding general elections in December 2008.

===Foreign policy===
* Saudi Arabia: Zia made some high-profile foreign visits in the later part of 2012. Invited to Saudi Arabia in August by the royal family, she met with the Saudi crown prince and defence minister Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to talk about bilateral ties. She tried to promote better access for Bangladeshi migrant workers to the Saudi labour market, which was in decline at the time.
* People&#x27;s Republic of China: She went to People&#x27;s Republic of China in October, at the invitation of the government. She met with Chinese leaders including Vice President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China&#x27;s international affairs chief Wang Jiarui. Xi became China&#x27;s Paramount Leader in 2012.

Talks in China related to trade and prospective Chinese investment in Bangladesh, particularly the issue of financing Padma Bridge. At the beginning of 2012, the World Bank, a major prospective financier, had withdrawn, accusing government ministers of graft. The BNP announced that the Chinese funding for a second Padma Bridge was confirmed during her visit.
* India: On 28 October 2012, Zia visited India to meet with President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and a number of officials including foreign minister Salman Khurshid, national security adviser Shivshankar Menon, foreign secretary Ranjan Mathai and BJP leader and leader of opposition Sushma Swaraj. Talks were scheduled to cover bilateral trade and regional security.

Zia&#x27;s India visit was considered notable as BNP had been considered to have been anti-India compared to its rival Awami League. At her meeting with Prime Minister Singh, Zia said her party wanted to work with India for mutual benefit, including the fight against extremism. Indian officials announced they had come to agreement with her to pursue a common geopolitical doctrine in the greater region to discourage terrorists.

==Post-premiership (since 2006)==
===Detention during the caretaker government===
Former Bangladesh Bank governor Fakhruddin Ahmed became the Chief Adviser to the interim caretaker government on 12 January 2007. In March, Zia&#x27;s eldest son, Tarique Rahman, was arrested for corruption. Enforcing the suppression of political activity under the state of emergency, from 9 April, the government barred politicians from visiting Zia&#x27;s residence. Her other son, Arafat Rahman (Coco), was arrested for corruption on 16 April. On 17 April, The Daily Star reported that Zia had agreed to go into exile with Arafat. Her family said, the Saudi Arabian government reportedly declined to allow her into the kingdom – apparently because &quot;it was reluctant to take in an unwilling guest&quot;. Based on an appeal, on 22 April, the High Court issued a ruling for the government to explain that she was not confined to her house. On 25 April, the government lifted restrictions on both Zia and Sheikh Hasina. On 7 May, the High Court ordered the government to explain continuing restrictions on Zia.

On 17 July, the Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh (ACC) sent notices to both Zia and Hasina, requesting that details of their assets be submitted to the commission within one week. Zia was asked to appear in court on 27 September in connection with a case for not submitting service returns for Daily Dinkal Publications Limited for years. On 2 September, the government filed charges of corruption against Zia related to the awarding of contracts to Global Agro Trade Company in 2003. She was arrested on 3 September. She was detained in a makeshift prison on the parliament building premises. On the same day, Zia expelled her party Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and Joint Secretary General Whip Ashraf Hossain for breaching party discipline.

BNP standing committee members chose former Minister of Finance Saifur Rahman and former Minister of Water Resources Hafizuddin Ahmed to lead the party. Bangladesh Election Commission subsequently invited Hafizuddin&#x27;s faction, rather than Zia&#x27;s, to participate in talks, effectively recognizing the former as the legitimate BNP. Zia challenged this in court, but her appeal was rejected on 10 April 2008.

Zia was released on bail on 11 September 2008 from her yearlong detention.

In December 2008, the caretaker government organized general elections where Zia&#x27;s party lost to the Awami League and its Grand Alliance (with 13 smaller parties) which took a two-thirds majority of seats in the parliament. Sheikh Hasina became the prime minister, and her party formed government in early 2009. Zia became the opposition leader of the parliament.

=== Eviction from the cantonment house ===
Zia&#x27;s family had been living for 38 years in the 2.72-acre plot house at 6 Shaheed Mainul Road house in Dhaka Cantonment. It was the official residence of her husband, Ziaur Rahman, when he was appointed as the Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS) of the Bangladesh Army. After, he became the President of Bangladesh, he kept the house as his residence. Following his assassination in 1981, the acting President Abdus Sattar, leased the house &quot;for life&quot; to Zia, for a nominal ৳101. When the army took over the government in 1983, Hussain Mohammad Ershad confirmed this arrangement.

On 20 April 2009, the Directorate of Military Lands and Cantonments handed a notice asking Zia to vacate the cantonment residence. Several allegations and irregularities mentioned in the notice – first, Zia had been carrying out political activities from the house – which went against a condition of the allotment; second, one cannot get an allotment of two government houses in the capital; third, a civilian cannot get a resident lease within a cantonment. Zia vacated the house on 13 November 2010. She then moved to the residence of her brother, Sayeed Iskandar, at the Gulshan neighborhood.
===Boycotting 2014 election===
Zia&#x27;s party took a stance on not participating in the 2014 Bangladeshi general election unless, it was administered under a nonpartisan caretaker government, but the then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina rejected the demand. The Bangladesh Awami League, led by Hasina, won the election in 232 seats (out of 300). The official counts from Dhaka suggested that the turnout here averaged about 22 percent.

In 2016, BNP announced its new National Standing Committee, in which Zia retained her position as the chairperson.
In 2017, the police conducted a raid on Zia&#x27;s house search for &quot;anti-state&quot; documents.

===Charges and imprisonment in 2018===
On 3 July 2008, during the 2007–08 caretaker government rule, ACC had filed a graft case, accusing Zia and five others of misappropriating over Tk 2.1 crore that had come from a foreign bank as grants for orphans. According to the case, on 9 June 1991, $1.255M (Tk 4.45 crore) grant was transferred from United Saudi Commercial Bank to &quot;Prime Minister&#x27;s Orphanage Fund&quot; – a fund that was created by then Prime Minister Zia shortly before the transfer of the grant as part of the embezzlement scheme. On 5 September 1993, she issued a Tk 2.33 crore cheque from the &quot;Prime Minister&#x27;s Orphanage Fund&quot; to the &quot;Zia Orphanage Trust&quot; on the pretext of building an orphanage in Bogra. By April 2006, the deposited amount grew to Tk 3.37 crore with accrued interest. In April, June and July 2006, some of the money was transferred to bank accounts of three other accused – Salimul, Mominur and Sharfuddin – through different transactions. On 15 February 2007, Tk 2.10 crore was withdrawn through pay orders from two of the FDR accounts. Zia was accused of misappropriating that money by transferring the amount from a public fund to a private one.

On 8 February 2018, during the Awami League government rule, Zia was sentenced to prison for five years in that corruption case. Mobile phone jammers were installed at Bakshibazar court premises ahead of the verdict. Her party claimed that the verdict was politically biased. Zia was sent to the Old Dhaka Central Jail after the verdict. She was imprisoned as the sole inmate at the jail since all the inmates had been transferred to the newly built Dhaka Central Jail in Keraniganj in 2016. On 11 February 2018, Dhaka Special Judge&#x27;s Court 5 directed the authorities of Dhaka Central Jail to provide first class division to Zia. On 31 October 2018, the High Court raised her jail term to 10 years after ACC pleaded for a revision.

On 30 October 2018, in another case, &quot;Zia Charitable Trust Graft Case&quot;, Zia was sentenced to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment. Khaleda is also accused in other 32 cases including &quot;Gatco Graft Case&quot;, &quot;Niko Graft Case&quot;, &quot;Barapukuria Coalmine Graft Case&quot;, &quot;Darussalam Police Station Cases&quot;, &quot;Jatrabari Police Station Cases&quot;, &quot;Sedition Case&quot;, &quot;Bomb Attack on Shipping Minister Case&quot;, &quot;Khulna Arson Case&quot;, &quot;Comilla Arson Case&quot;, &quot;Celebrating Fake Birthday Case&quot;, &quot;Undermining National Flag Case&quot; and &quot;Loan Default Case&quot;.

Zia&#x27;s nomination papers to contest for Feni-1, Bogra-6 and Bogra-7 constituencies at the 2018 general election were rejected. She was not able to contest because according to article 66 (2) (d) of the constitution, &quot;a person shall be disqualified for election as, or for being, a member of parliament who has been, on conviction for a criminal offence involving moral turpitude, sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years, unless a period of five years has elapsed since his/her release&quot;. Her party lost that general election to Awami League.

Zia was admitted to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University for medical treatment on 1 April 2019. The High Court and the Supreme Court rejected her bail plea on humanitarian grounds a total four times.

On 25 March 2020, Zia was released from prison for six months, conditioned she would stay at her home in Gulshan and not leave the country. The government issued this executive decision as per section 401 (1) of the Criminal Code of Procedure (CrPC). By 2021, the term of her release had been extended four times.

After the fall of Hasina government she was acquitted in several cases.

On 27 November 2024, Zia was acquitted in the Charitable Trust graft and Barapukuria graft cases.

On 15 January 2025, Zia was acquitted in the orphanage trust graft case.

=== 2024 release ===
After Sheikh Hasina was ousted as prime minister during the 2024 Non-cooperation movement, on 5 August, President Mohammed Shahabuddin ordered the release of Khaleda Zia. Shortly afterwards, she made her first public statements since 2018 from her medical confinement, during which she praised &quot;the brave people who were in a do-or-die struggle to make possible the impossible&quot; and urged restraint and the need for &quot;love and peace&quot; in rebuilding Bangladesh. On 13 August, the home ministry restored her police escort privileges that had been removed by Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s government in 2015. On 19 August, Zia&#x27;s bank accounts, which had been frozen since 2007, were ordered unblocked by the National Board of Revenue.

=== Illness ===
Zia has been suffering from chronic kidney conditions, decompensated liver diseases, unstable haemoglobin, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other age-related complications. In April 2021, several staff members in Zia&#x27;s home tested positive for COVID-19. Zia also found to have contracted the virus but she exhibited no symptoms and recovered later. On 28 November, the medical board formed for Zia&#x27;s treatment announced that she had been suffering from liver cirrhosis. A plea for her to be allowed allowing to seek medical care abroad was denied by the court. Zia underwent treatment at Evercare Hospital in Dhaka during 27 April–19 June 2021, 12 October–3 November 2021 and again since 14 November 2021. On 9 January 2022, Zia was transferred from critical care unit (CCU).

On 7 January 2025, Zia went to London aboard a special air ambulance sent by the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to seek medical treatment. On 8 January 2025, Zia was admitted to The London Clinic.

== Electoral history ==

==Birth date discrepancy==
Zia claims 15 August as her birthday, which is a matter of controversy in Bangladeshi politics. 15 August is the day many immediate family members of Zia&#x27;s political rival, Sheikh Hasina, including her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were killed. As a result of the deaths, 15 August was officially declared National Mourning Day of Bangladesh during the Hasina regime. None of Zia&#x27;s government issued identification documents show her birthday on 15 August. Her matriculation examination certificate lists a birth date of 9 August 1945. Her marriage certificate lists 5 September 1945. Zia&#x27;s passport indicates a birth date of 5 August 1946. Kader Siddiqui, a political ally of Zia, urged her not to celebrate her birthday on 15 August.

The High Court filed a petition against Zia on this issue. In 2016, Gazi Zahirul Islam, the former joint general secretary of the Dhaka Union of Journalists, filed a case against Zia over her birthdate, accusing her of seeking to tarnish the reputation of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and family. However, she was acquitted in 2024.

==Awards and honours==
* On 24 May 2011, the New Jersey State Senate honoured Zia as a &quot;Fighter for Democracy&quot;. It was the first time the state Senate had so honoured any foreign leader and reflects the state&#x27;s increasing population of immigrants and descendants from South Asia.
* Later, on 31 July 2018, an organization named Canadian Human Rights International Organization (CHRIO) gave her the &#x27;Mother of Democracy&#x27; award. On 8 February 2022, BNP presented the crest and certificate given by this Canadian organization to the journalists in a press conference at the BNP Chairperson&#x27;s office in Gulshan.

<text>&quot;Lyonpo&quot; Jigme Yoser Thinley (Dzongkha: འཇིགས་མེད་འོད་ཟེར་འཕྲིན་ལས་; Wylie:&quot; &#x27;Jigs-med &#x27;Od-zer &#x27;Phrin-las&quot;) (born 9 September 1952) is a Bhutanese politician who served as Prime Minister of Bhutan for three nonconsecutive terms, from 20 July 1998 to 9 July 1999, 30 August 2003 to 18 August 2004 and 9 April 2008 to 28 April 2013.

==Biography==
Thinley was born in Bumthang and joined the civil service in 1976 upon receiving a graduate degree from The Pennsylvania State University. He received an undergraduate degree from St. Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi. 

In February 1987, Thinley was awarded the title of &quot;Dasho&quot; and the Red Scarf, and in 1990, under the zonal system, he became administrator of the Eastern Zone. He then became secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1992 before being appointed as Deputy Minister of Home Affairs in January 1994, at which time he was also awarded the Orange Scarf. Later in 1994, he was appointed as Bhutan&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations office and other international organizations in Geneva.

Prior to the beginning of Bhutanese democracy, he was Prime Minister twice, from 20 July 1998 to 9 July 1999, and from 30 August 2003 to 20 August 2004. During this period, chairmanship of the council was based on rotation once per year, with the order of rotation decided by the number of votes secured during the time of election to the council. Jigme was also the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bhutan from 1998 until 2003 and subsequently served as Minister of Home and Cultural Affairs.

In March 2008, he stood as leader of the political party Druk Phuensum Tshogpa in Bhutan&#x27;s first democratic election. His party won 45 of the 47 seats in the National Assembly of Bhutan, which enabled Jigme Thinley to become Bhutan&#x27;s first ever elected Prime Minister. He took office on 9 April.

Thinley blamed the global economic crisis of 2008–2009 on &quot;insatiable human greed&quot; and stressed the need to instead focus on the Bhutanese notion of gross national happiness. His government works to base its policies on gross national happiness rather than purely economic considerations.

In July 2009, Thinley became a member of the SNV Netherlands Development Organisation&#x27;s International Advisory Board.

==Personal life==
His son Palden married Princess &quot;Ashi&quot; Kesang Choden Wangchuck on 11 November 2008.

His wife &quot;Aum&quot; Rinsy Dem died in Bangkok on 28 November 2018.

He has honorary doctorates from KIIT University and University of Louvain (UCLouvain). 

==Honours==
He has honorary doctorates from KIIT University and University of Louvain (UCLouvain).

<doc id="393773" wikidata="Q7868902" url="?curid=393773" title="USS Dolphin (PG-24)">
<text>USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; (PG-24) was a gunboat/dispatch vessel; the fourth ship of the United States Navy to share the name. &quot;Dolphin&quot; was the first U.S. Navy ship to fly the flag of the president of the United States during President Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s administration, and the second Navy ship to serve as a presidential yacht.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Dolphin&quot;″s keel was laid down by Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works of Chester, Pennsylvania. She was launched on 12 April 1884, with Captain George Dewey in command, and commissioned on 8 December 1885 with Captain R. W. Meade in command. 

&quot;Dolphin&quot; was originally built as a dispatch vessel, intended to courier messages, as radio had not yet been invented. She was the only U.S. Navy vessel ever specifically designated as such. She was also called an &quot;unarmored&quot; or &quot;unprotected&quot; cruiser, and was eventually designated as a patrol gunboat (PG-24) on 1 July 1921, a few months before she was sold to Mexico. She was ordered as part of the &quot;ABCD&quot; ships, along with the cruisers , , and . These were the first ships of what came to be called the &quot;New Navy&quot;, representing the transition from wooden-hulled to steel-hulled warships. Like the other three, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was built with a sail rig (later removed) to increase the ship&#x27;s cruising range due to the inefficient steam engines of the day. All were ordered from the same shipyard, John Roach &amp; Sons of Chester, Pennsylvania. However, when Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney initially refused to accept &quot;Dolphin&quot;, claiming her design was defective, the Roach yard went bankrupt and the remaining three ships were completed in navy yards that had little experience with steel-hulled ships. Built for speed at the expense of protection, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was unarmored and her engine was unprotected as it extended above the waterline.

She was built with one /30 caliber Mark 1 gun, two 6-pounder () rapid-fire guns, and four 3-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; was powered by four coal-fired cylindrical boilers and one 1 vertical compound engine producing for a speed of .

===Refits===
References vary as to &quot;Dolphin&quot;″s armament in a given period. In 1891, the 6-inch gun was replaced by two /40 caliber guns. In 1913 her armament was replaced with six 6-pounders, augmented by two /50 caliber guns in 1918. By 1921 her armament was one /50 caliber gun and two 6-pounders.

==Service history==

===Before Spanish–American War===

The first of the vessels of the &quot;New Navy&quot; to be completed, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was assigned to the North Atlantic Station, cruising along the eastern seaboard until February 1886. She then sailed around South America on her way to the Pacific Squadron for duty.

She visited ports in Japan, Korea, China, Ceylon, India, Arabia, Egypt, Italy, Spain, and England, and the islands of Madeira and Bermuda, before arriving at New York City on 27 September 1889 to complete her round-the-world cruise.

She returned to duty on the North Atlantic Station, cruising in the West Indies from 9 December 1889 to 12 June 1890. On 23 December 1890, she was reassigned to the Squadron of Evolution and sailed from New York City on 7 January 1891 for a Caribbean cruise, returning to Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 April 1891.

Out of commission from 1 May 1891 to 14 March 1892, &quot;Dolphin&quot; then resumed her cruising along the United States East Coast, often carrying the United States Secretary of the Navy. In April 1893, President Grover Cleveland conducted New York&#x27;s inaugural International Naval Review from the deck of the &quot;Dolphin&quot;. On 3 December 1895, she was assigned to the Special Service Squadron and made a surveying expedition to Guatemala in January–February 1896. She carried President William McKinley and his party during the naval review following the ceremonies dedicating Grant&#x27;s Tomb in New York City on 27 April 1897. &quot;Dolphin&quot; was placed out of commission at New York on 23 November 1897.

===Spanish–American War===
&quot;Dolphin&quot; was recommissioned on 24 March 1898, just prior to the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, and served on blockade duty off Havana, Cuba in April–May. On 6 June, she came under fire from the Morro Battery at Santiago. On 14 June, she provided fire support for elements of the 1st Marine Battalion at the Battle of Cuzco Well in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba resulting in a total rout of the Spanish forces. Later that month, she sailed for Norfolk, arriving on 2 July.

===Before World War I===

From 1899 until the outbreak of World War I in Europe, &quot;Dolphin&quot; served as a special dispatch ship for the Secretary of the Navy and often carried the President of the United States and other important officials and diplomats. She visited Washington Navy Yard for the Peace Jubilee of 14 May – 30 June 1899; New York City for the George Dewey celebration of 26–29 September; and Alexandria, Virginia, for the city&#x27;s sesquicentennial on 10 October. From 7 November 1899 – 2 February 1900, she cruised to Venezuela to survey the mouth of the Orinoco River. On 27–28 May 1900, &quot;Dolphin&quot; anchored off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, with President William McKinley on board to observe a total solar eclipse. She departed Washington, D.C., on 11 January 1902 to survey the southeast coast of Santo Domingo, then carried the Chief of the Bureau of Equipment from Havana for a tour of inspection of the coaling stations in the West Indies. She returned to Washington on 6 May.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; sailed from Norfolk on 2 December 1902 to carry mail and dispatches to Culebra Island, Puerto Rico, then took the U.S. Minister to Venezuela to La Guaira, arriving on 11 January 1903. She continued to cruise in the West Indies until returning to Washington, D.C., on 19 April. From 1903 to 1905, she carried such dignitaries as the Naval Committee, Secretary of the Navy, Admiral and Mrs. George Dewey, the Philippine Commissioners, the Attorney General, Prince Louis of Battenberg and his party, and President Theodore Roosevelt on various cruises. In January 1904, she carried the remains of James Smithson, which had arrived in New York City from Genoa, Italy, for re-interment in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Early in August 1905, she carried the Japanese peace plenipotentiaries from Oyster Bay, New York, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to negotiate the settlement of the Russo-Japanese War. In 1907, the first live singing performed over radio, by Eugenia Farrar from Lee de Forest&#x27;s laboratory atop the Parker Building, was received by the &quot;Dolphin&quot;&#x27;s wireless operator, Oliver A. Wyckoff, while docked at Brooklyn Navy Yard.

She continued on primarily ceremonial duty, participating in the interment of John Paul Jones at the United States Naval Academy, and the departure ceremonies for the Great White Fleet until 22 October 1908, when she became flagship of the Third Squadron, Atlantic Fleet.

When Franklin D. Roosevelt became Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1913, he occasionally used &quot;Dolphin&quot; to transport himself and his family. During his time on &quot;Dolphin&quot; FDR forged lifelong friendships with future Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy and Richard E. Byrd, both of whom served aboard. &quot;Dolphin&quot; was Byrd&#x27;s third assignment after graduating from the Naval Academy. He served on &quot;Dolphin&quot; until he was medically retired in 1916 for a foot injury he sustained on board &quot;Dolphin&quot;.

====Tampico, Veracruz, and Santo Domingo====
In the spring of 1914 the Third Squadron – with &quot;Dolphin&quot; as flagship – sailed into Tampico to protect American lives and property. When some sailors from &quot;Dolphin&quot; were arrested by the Mexican government on 9 April 1914, the Tampico Affair took place, which later resulted in the United States occupation of Veracruz. On 23 November 1914, after seven months, the United States withdrew its armed forces. Subsequently, &quot;Dolphin&quot; assisted in the occupation of Santo Domingo from 12 to 22 May 1916. Her career as flagship continued until 1917.

===World War I===
In March 1917 President Woodrow Wilson started arming US merchant ships in response to attacks by the Central Powers. First to be armed was the cargo ship , on which two 5-inch guns were installed. A lieutenant and 11 ratings were detached from &quot;Dolphin&quot; at Washington Navy Yard and transferred to crew &quot;Aztec&quot;″s guns.

Sailing from Washington, D.C., on 2 April 1917 to take possession of the recently purchased United States Virgin Islands, &quot;Dolphin&quot; received word four days later that war had been declared between the U.S. and Germany.

The next day, she arrived at St. Thomas and the squadron commander assumed office as Governor of the Virgin Islands on 9 April. &quot;Dolphin&quot; carried the Governor and his staff to the islands of Saint Croix and St. John to hoist the American flag with proper ceremony. On 26 April, she began a search for the steamer &quot;Nordskar&quot;, flying Danish colors, but suspected of aiding enemy operations. She found her at St. Lucia on 5 May and since her registry showed irregularities, &quot;Dolphin&quot; kept her in custody until departing for Key West, Florida on 28 June, when she turned her charge over to British authorities. &quot;Dolphin&quot; continued to patrol in the Caribbean Sea until arriving at Washington on 6 September.

Assigned as flagship for the American Patrol Detachment on 17 September 1917, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was based at Key West, and operated in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea to protect merchant shipping until the end of the war.

During World War I, this &quot;Dolphin&quot; was one of three U.S. Navy vessels in commission or considered for service of this name, and should not be confused with , a fishing vessel the U.S. Navy considered for service as a patrol vessel in 1917 but apparently never acquired from her owners, or with , a patrol vessel in commission during 1918.

===After World War I===
&quot;Dolphin&quot; remained in the Caribbean until her departure for New York City on 25 June 1920. After an overhaul at Boston, Massachusetts, she sailed on 16 October as flagship of the Special Service Squadron and joined the gunboat in representing the United States at the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the Straits of Magellan. &quot;Dolphin&quot; returned to Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone, and was based there for target practice, for hydrographic experiments, and to obtain political information, visiting various neighboring countries to promote friendly relations. On 16 September 1921, she was at Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, to attend the observance of the anniversary of Guatemalan independence.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; arrived at the Boston Navy Yard on 14 October 1921. She was decommissioned on 8 December 1921, after 36 years of service, and sold to Mexico on 25 February 1922. She served in Mexico with the name Plan de Guadalupe until stricken in 1924. She was scrapped circa 1927.

<doc id="393776" wikidata="Q434742" url="?curid=393776" title="Paramanga Ernest Yonli">
<text>Paramanga Ernest Yonli (born 31 December 1956) also known as Ernest Paramanga Yonli, is a Burkinabé politician. He was Prime Minister from 6 November 2000 to 3 June 2007 and then President of the Economic and Social Council of Burkina Faso until March 2015.

He is a member of the Congress for Democracy and Progress party and a Grand Officer of the National Order of Burkina Faso.

==Biography==

Yonli is a descendant of the last dynasty of the Gurma kingdom, founded at the end of the 13th century by migrants from Kanem–Bornu, a region situated initially between modern Niger, Nigeria, and Chad. 

This dynasty, often confused with the history of the Gurma people, who live in Eastern Burkina Faso, can be subdivided into three lines: Yobri, Tambaga, and Tansarga. 

Paramanga Ernest Yonli comes from one of the ruling families of the last line of Tansarga.

The Gurma society is organized around a power center of a founding family, ministers of the court, and the people. This power center is governed by democratic principles whereby all adult citizens appoint the Chief or the King following an aligned vote. Paramanga Ernest Yonli&#x27;s great-grandfather, grandfather, and father each ruled Tansarga in the canton of Gobnangou. Today his older brother remains the chief of the village of Tansarga.

Yonli obtained his mathematics and natural sciences baccalaureate with honors in 1976.

At the university level, following a degree in general economics at the University of Ouagadougou, he became top of his class in his Masters in economic sciences at the University of Benin in Togo, then completed his training with a Ph.D. at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. His thesis focused on &quot;Farmer strategies in food security and cereal marketing: the role of cereal banks in the North Plateau-Central of Burkina Faso.&quot;

Paramanga Ernest Yonli is also a specialist in international economics (Paris I University – Pantheon Sorbonne) and development and agricultural economics (same institution).

Married to Safi, one of the daughters of former President Saye Zerbo (1980–82), he is father to four children.

==Career==
After working in management and business administration in France, he began a career as a researcher at the University of Ouagadougou from 1985 to 1994. During this period, he became a member of an international multi-disciplinary research team whose work focused on “risks in agriculture” in semi-arid areas. This international research body, headquartered in Europe, brings together researchers from the European Union and ECOWAS countries like Ghana, Burkina Faso, Benin, Togo, the Ivory Coast, etc.

The Ph.D. thesis he defended in 1997 at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands was a logical progression from the research results discovered by this international team in Burkina Faso, particularly in the provinces of Yatenga, Sanmatenga, Namentenga, Bam, and Passoré. In October 1994, Paramanga Ernest Yonli was appointed, in addition to his role as researcher, the Director General of the National Fund for the Promotion of Employment (F.A.P.E.). He was tasked with reorganizing this body to promote the self-employment of graduates from the country&#x27;s universities and professional training colleges.

Upon receiving further funding, Yonli extended the Fund to artisans and the informal sector. He decentralized the Fund, opening branches in Burkina Faso&#x27;s ten main towns after Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso, thus demonstrating his sense of innovation and openness to modernization.

==Political career==
In 1992, during the first general elections, which saw the return of Burkina Faso to the rule of law, Yonli was approached to head up the list of ODP/MT candidates in his constituency of Tapoa. He declined the offer for personal reasons, but led the campaign that saw his party win two of the three contested seats.

During the elections for the second government of the 4th Republic in 1997, while simultaneously serving as Cabinet Leader for Prime Minister Kadré Désiré Ouedraogo from 1996, he headed up the list of candidates for the ruling party, which had since become the Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP). As a result, he won the two contested seats in his constituency and would go on to do the same in 2002, 2007, and 2012.

Although elected four times as a Member of the National Assembly (1997 to 2012), Yonli never took his seat as an MP, occupying senior governmental posts throughout this period instead. Firstly, as Cabinet Leader for the Prime Minister in 1996, as mentioned above, then as Minister of Civil Service and of State Reform in 1997, and finally as Prime Minister and Head of Government in 2000, a post he would occupy for seven years. He holds the record for the longest time spent in senior political positions in his country. Additionally, he served as Minister of Finance from 2000 to 2002.

In 2007, he was appointed Ambassador for Burkina Faso to the United States. He would be the first Ambassador to bring together the entire Burkinabé community residing in the United States, as well as traveling regularly to the University of Houston in Texas to visit one of the largest Burkinabé student communities in the United States.

He returned to his home country in 2012 to become President of the Economic and Social Council, a post he still occupies today.

==Achievements for Burkina Faso==
The leadership of Yonli was characterized by his innovation, his promotion of the fundamental values of Burkinabé society (dialogue – tolerance - forgiveness), and efficiency.

===Implementation of the Global Public Administration Reform (RGAP)===
When in September 1997, President Blaise Compaoré appointed Yonli as Minister for Civil Service, he gave him the formidable task of overseeing the Global Public Administration Reform. Following several attempts at reform, both with social partners and with members of the National Assembly, this project had still not been completed despite the government&#x27;s overwhelming majority in the National Assembly (101 MPs out of 111). It was the first challenge taken up by Yonli. Following the start of his role in September 1997, he would organize national reform hearings in December of the same year and successfully secure the adoption of three laws governing the Global Public Administration Reform as of the first session of the National Assembly in 1998.

===Institutionalization of social dialogue===
To further cement the public administration reform, Yonli implemented a permanent consultation framework between trade union organizations and the government. This government-trade union meeting was to become institutionalized in 2000 when Yonli became the Burkinabé head of government. These now annual meetings allow the two sides to examine on a yearly basis the negotiating platform of trade union organizations on the one hand, and government actions aimed at the promotion and optimization of the reform&#x27;s content on the other. The institutionalization of these meetings has helped reduce labour conflicts as much as possible, and to instil trust between the government and workers’ unions, both of which have shored up social stability which is a pre-requisite for the harmonious development of a nascent democracy.

===Institutionalization of government-private sector dialogue===
In July 2001, in Bobo Dioulasso, Yonli decided in agreement with the business world, to institutionalize exchanges between the government and the entire private sector. Welcomed by the Chamber of Commerce and development partners, this meeting which is held yearly in the economic capital allows countries to share their economic and social achievements over the past year, gauge the extent of challenges faced and forecast for the year ahead. This meeting, which still takes place today, has become a key tool for economic governance in Burkina Faso, because it allows the government to make their interventions in the economic sector more targeted, in line with medium and long-term economic planning benchmarks.

===National Youth Forum and Annual women’s conference===
Drawing on the sectoral strategies of international organisations, under the Yonli government Burkina Faso decided to go beyond conventional gender management methods and organise annual meetings focused on women and young people in 2004. These meetings have served as a forum for self-reflection and brainstorming to effectively tackle the problem of promoting and developing these two social groups who make up more than 70% of the country&#x27;s active population.

===Creation of ‘’BURKINA 2025’’ and reintroduction of the National Territorial Development Plan (SNAT)===

When Yonli became head of government at the end of 2000, he had three main objectives:
# Quickly restore peace after the assassination of journalist Norbert Zongo;
# Ensure decentralization;
# Speed up the implementation of poverty reduction reforms.

These three objectives were tackled by a cabinet which he composed himself and submitted to Président COMPAORÉ who approved it without any significant changes. The cabinet made up of technocrats, politicians and representatives from civil society, got to work on the priorities set by Yonli.

On a social level, dialogue was used as a driving force to foster the right conditions for peace through calls for tolerance and patriotism. In terms of the decentralization objective, the government chose a progressive approach to ensure the best conditions for the adoption of this process by business managers, elected representatives and the wider population.

On an economic level, under the Yonli Government, economic growth went from an annual rate of between 3 and 4% to a rate ranging from 7 to 9%.

Decentralization in Burkina Faso was kick-started. As a result, the process is now complete and serves as a benchmark in the sub-region. Under the Yonli Government, 13 regions were created, making up the 4 provinces. Furthermore, the guidelines for decentralization allowed for the number of communes to be changed from 55 to 30, to allow the population to appoint their local authorities, which led to the development of participatory democracy and also to the development of local economies.

Programmes to combat poverty, although not achieving all anticipated results, have made the country the best economic performer in the sub-region from the point of view of its multilateral partners.

It is also worth mentioning the ten-year education development programme, which has helped speed up the literacy rate. Under his government, the rate of school enrolment has gone from 39 to 70% in seven years.

Finally, instruments for the identification, evaluation and reduction of poverty have now become everyday tools for planning and economic governance leaders. These are all things which help to make development projects and programmes more targeted and yield faster and more tangible results.

This was consolidated thanks to the two major decisions which today underpin the country&#x27;s economic and social governance:

* Making development part of the long-term perspective through the creation of a national roadmap called BURKINA 2025.
* The creation of a global visibility framework called the National Territorial Development Plan, which organizes development by tapping into regional potential, to optimize the various areas of expertise specific to each region.

===Economic promotion of Burkina Faso overseas===
In 2004, Yonli undertook a world tour to promote Burkina Faso&#x27;s economic potential. The objective of his trip was to provide sufficient information on the economic potential of the country to thus increase its attractiveness to investors.

With this in mind, he visited, accompanied by business leaders:

* April 2004: Geneva, with 50 businessmen.
* October 2004: Canada, with 80 businessmen. During his visit, he heavily emphasized Burkina Faso&#x27;s gold mining potential.
* April 2005: France, with 70 businessmen.
* September 2005: Malaysia, again with around 50 businessmen.

The most significant results of this came after the visit to Canada. It was during this visit that major gold mines were opened, including the first gold mine in Taparko (Sanmatenga province). By 2009, six gold mines were operational, placing gold at the top of the list of products exported from the country, ahead of cotton. Currently, a new mining code is in the process of being adopted, to strike a balance between the profits made by miners, the government and the local populations.

===Achievements within the Economic and Social Council===
Since 2012, as President of the Economic and Social Council, Yonli has published various reports including:
* A report on agriculture, highlighting the need to develop this sector in Burkina Faso.
* A second report on gold and the need to submit a new mining code to the National Assembly.
* A third report on governance and distrust of public authority, with solutions for sustainable social stability.

==Opposition to Article 37==
Having reiterated the legality of such a Constitutional reform during a meeting of the CDP at the Stade du 4 Août, Yonli nevertheless officially participated in Autumn 2014 in the drafting of a public report to the Economic and Social Council on the political and social risks linked to such a Constitutional reform.

It is noteworthy that the National Assembly&#x27;s draft vote on the reform of Article 37 of Burkina Faso&#x27;s Constitution ultimately caused President Blaise Compaoré&#x27;s demise.

<text>Samdech Hun Sen (; , UNGEGN: ; born 5 August 1952) is a Cambodian politician, and former army general who currently serves as the president of the Senate. He previously served as the prime minister of Cambodia from 1985 to 1993 and from 1998 to 2023. Hun Sen is the longest-serving head of government in Cambodia&#x27;s history. He is the president of the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP), which has governed Cambodia since 1979, and has served as a member of the Senate since 2024. His full honorary title is Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen ( ; meaning &quot;Lord Prime Minister and Supreme Military Commander Hun Sen&quot;).

Born Hun Bunal, he changed his name to Hun Sen in 1972, two years after joining the Khmer Rouge as a soldier. He fought for the Khmer Rouge in the Cambodian Civil War and was a battalion commander in Democratic Kampuchea until defecting in 1977 and fighting alongside Vietnamese forces in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. From 1979 to 1986 and again from 1987 to 1990, he served as Cambodia&#x27;s foreign minister in the Vietnamese occupied government. At age 26, he was also the world&#x27;s youngest foreign minister.

Hun Sen rose to the premiership in January 1985 when the one-party National Assembly appointed him to succeed Chan Sy, who had died in office in December 1984. He held the position until the 1993 UN-backed elections which resulted in a hung parliament, with opposition party FUNCINPEC winning the majority of votes. Hun Sen refused to accept the result. After negotiations with FUNCINPEC, Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen agreed to simultaneously serve as First and Second Prime Minister, until the coalition broke down and Sen orchestrated a coup d&#x27;état in 1997 which toppled Ranariddh. Between 1998 and 2023, Hun Sen led the CPP to consecutive and often contentious election victories, overseeing rapid economic growth and development, but also corruption, deforestation and human rights violations. In 2013, Hun Sen and the CPP were reelected with a significantly reduced majority amidst a resurgent opposition. Allegations of voter fraud and irregularities led to unprecedented anti-government protests. In 2018, he was elected to a sixth and final term in a largely unopposed poll after the Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition party, with the CPP winning every seat in the National Assembly. He led the country during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and Cambodia&#x27;s third chairmanship of ASEAN; and, after the 2023 election formally announced his resignation as prime minister in favour of his son, Hun Manet. He remains as party leader and in 2024, was appointed president of the Senate, ensuring his continued influence over the country&#x27;s politics.

Hun Sen has been prominent in communist, Marxist–Leninist, and now state capitalist and national conservative political parties, and although Khmer nationalism has been a consistent trait of all of them, he is thought to lack a core political ideology. He has been described as a &quot;wily operator who destroys his political opponents&quot; by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and as a dictator who has assumed highly centralized power in Cambodia and considerable personal wealth using violence and corruption, including a personal guard said to rival the country&#x27;s regular army.

==Early life and education==

Hun Sen was born on 4 April 1951, in Peam Kaoh Sna, Kampong Cham as Hun Bunal (also called Hun Nal), the third of six children. His father, Hun Neang, had been a resident monk in a local Wat in Kampong Cham province before defrocking himself to join the French resistance and marry Hun Sen&#x27;s mother, Dee Yon, in the 1940s. Hun Neang&#x27;s paternal grandparents were wealthy landowners of Chinese heritage. His Chinese ancestry is at Zhuanshui Village, Tanjiang Town, Fengshun County.

Hun Neang inherited some of his family assets, including several hectares of land, and led a relatively comfortable life until a kidnapping incident forced their family to sell off much of their assets. Hun Nal left his family at the age of 13 to attend a monastic school in Phnom Penh. At the time, he changed his name to Ritthi Sen or simply Sen; his prior given name, Nal, was often a nickname for overweight children.

He graduated with a master in state administrative management from the National Academy of Public Administration of Vietnam.

==Military career and entry to politics==

When Lon Nol removed Norodom Sihanouk from power in 1970, Sen gave up his education to join the Khmer Rouge following Sihanouk&#x27;s call to join the insurgency. Sen also claims he was inspired to fight against foreign interference when his hometown of Memot was bombed by U.S. aircraft in Operation Menu. Sen claims he had no political opinions or ideology at the time. As a soldier, he again changed his name, this time to Hun Samrach, to conceal his identity.

He changed his name to Hun Sen two years later, saying that the name Hun Samrach had been inauspicious and that he had been wounded several times during the period he had that name. Sen rapidly ascended ranks as a soldier, and fought during the fall of Phnom Penh, becoming injured and being hospitalized for some time and sustaining a permanent eye injury.

In Democratic Kampuchea, Sen served as a Battalion Commander in the Eastern Region, with authority over around 2000 men. The involvement or role of Sen in the Cambodian genocide is unclear, although he denies complicity. &quot;Human Rights Watch&quot; suggested he may have had a role in a massacre to suppress Cham Muslim unrest in September–October 1975, but Sen has denied this, claiming that he had stopped following orders from the central government by this time. Sen claims he had increasing disagreements with Khmer Rouge authorities in the administration throughout 1975–1977.

In 1977, during internal purges of the Khmer Rouge regime, Hun Sen and his battalion cadres fled to Vietnam. During the Cambodian–Vietnamese War as Vietnam prepared to invade Cambodia, Hun Sen became one of the leaders of the Vietnamese-sponsored rebel army. He was given the secret name Mai Phúc by Vietnamese leaders.

Following the defeat of the Khmer Rouge regime, Hun Sen was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Vietnamese-installed People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea/State of Cambodia (PRK/SOC) in 1979 at age 26. The Vietnamese-appointed government appointed Sen some authority over the K5 Plan, a Khmer Rouge containment strategy that saw the mass mobilization of civilian labor in constructing barricades and land mines, although the extent of his involvement is unclear.

== First appointment as prime minister (1985–1993) ==
Hun Sen first rose to the premiership in January 1985 when the one-party National Assembly encouraged by &quot;politburo&quot; cadre Say Phouthang appointed him to succeed Chan Sy, who had died in office in December 1984. As the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Cambodia, in 1985, he was elected as Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Prime Minister. Sen oversaw continuing conflict against several ongoing insurgencies during this period.

In 1987, Amnesty International accused Hun Sen&#x27;s government of torturing thousands of political prisoners, using &quot;electric shocks, hot irons and near-suffocation with plastic bags.&quot;

=== Paris Peace Talks and UNTAC (1991–1993) ===

As foreign minister and then prime minister, Hun Sen played a role in the 1991 Paris Peace Talks, which brokered peace in Cambodia and formally ended the Cambodian–Vietnamese War.

He held the position of prime minister during the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) until the 1993 UN-sponsored elections, which resulted opposition party FUNCINPEC winning the majority of votes with a hung parliament. Hun Sen and his party formally rejected the result. With the support of much of the state apparatus, including the army and police, Hun Sen and his deputy Norodom Chakrapong threatened to lead the secession of seven provinces and CPP-backed forces committed violence against UN and FUNCINPEC forces although Sen distanced himself from the secessionist movement a few days later. UNTAC and FUNCINPEC conceded a unique power sharing agreement with Hun Sen serving as Second Prime Minister alongside First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh.

=== Co-premiership (1993–1997) ===
=== 1997 coup ===

In 1997, the coalition became unstable due to tensions between Ranariddh and Hun Sen. FUNCINPEC entered into discussions with the remaining Khmer Rouge rebels (with whom it had been allied against Hun Sen&#x27;s Vietnamese-backed government during the 1980s), with the aim of absorbing them into its ranks. Such a development would have altered the balance of military power between royalists and the CPP.

In response, Hun Sen launched the 1997 coup, replacing Ranariddh with Ung Huot as the First Prime Minister and maintaining his position as the Second Prime Minister.

In an open letter, Amnesty International condemned the summary execution of FUNCINPEC ministers and the &quot;systematic campaign of arrests and harassment&quot; of political opponents. Thomas Hammarberg, then Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Human Rights in Cambodia, strongly condemned the coup.

== Prime Minister of Cambodia (1998–2023) ==

In the 1998 election, he led the CPP to victory and forming a coalition with FUNCINPEC.

The elections of July 2003 resulted in a larger majority in the National Assembly for the CPP, with FUNCINPEC losing seats to the CPP and the Sam Rainsy Party. However, the CPP&#x27;s majority was short of the two thirds constitutionally required for the CPP to form a government alone. This deadlock was overcome when a new CPP-FUNCINPEC coalition was formed in mid-2004, with Norodom Ranariddh chosen to be head of the National Assembly and Hun Sen again becoming sole prime minister.

Sen has opposed extensive investigations and prosecutions related to crimes committed by former Khmer Rouge leaders by the UN-backed Khmer Rouge Tribunal.

On 6 May 2013, Hun Sen declared his intention to rule Cambodia until the age of 74.

=== 2013–2014 protests ===

After the July 2013 general elections both Hun Sen and his opponents Cambodia National Rescue Party claimed victory. In August, Hun Sen continued to pursue his aim of forming a new government. Cambodians in the United States, Canada and elsewhere, with hundreds of Buddhist Monks, peacefully protested in front of the United Nations in New York City on 19 August in opposition to Hun Sen&#x27;s deployment of military and security forces in Phnom Penh, his unwillingness to share political power with opposition groups and seriously address earlier voting fraud and election irregularities.

One person was killed and others injured during protests in Phnom Penh in September 2013, where a reported 20,000 protesters gathered, some clashing with riot police. Following two weeks of opposition protests, Hun Sen declared that he had been constitutionally elected and would not step down nor hold a new election.

On 7 September 2013, tens of thousands of Cambodians, along with Buddhist monks and opposition groups, including Sam Rainsy&#x27;s Cambodian National Rescue Party held mass demonstrations in Phnom Penh to protest the 28 July elections results which they claimed were flawed and marred by voting irregularities and potential fraud. The groups asked the United Nations to investigate and claimed that the elections results were not free and fair.

On 3 January 2014, military police opened fire at protesters, killing 4 people and injuring more than 20. The United Nations and US State Department condemned the violence. US Congressman Ed Royce responded to the report of violence in Cambodia by calling for Hun Sen to step down, saying that the Cambodian people deserve a better leader.

=== Consolidation of power (2015– 2023) ===



On 10 June 2014, Hun Sen made a public appearance and claimed he has no health problems. He warned that if he were to die prematurely, the country would spin out of control and the opposition could expect trouble from the armed forces, saying he is the only person who can control the army.

Following Hun Sen&#x27;s orders, on 31 January 2017, the National Assembly voted unanimously to abolish the Minority Leader and Majority Leader positions to lessen the opposition party&#x27;s influence. On 2 February 2017, Hun Sen barred the opposition from questioning some of his government ministers. Furthermore, Hun Sen vowed a constitutional amendment which later saw the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party dissolved. This move led to the surprise resignation of opposition leader Sam Rainsy. The controversial law was passed on 20 February 2017, effectively granting the ruling party the right to dissolve political parties. Opposition leader Kem Sokha was later arrested for treason.

On 30 June 2018, weeks before the parliamentary elections, Hun Sen appointed his second eldest son, Hun Manet, into higher military positions. Some analysts had speculated Manet may be a future candidate for Sen&#x27;s position. Hun Sen affirmed at the time that his son could become prime minister if elected rather than through direct handover, though he intends to rule until at least 2028.

The 2018 elections were dismissed as sham elections by the international community, the opposition party having been dissolved.

Hun Sen blocked the return of exiled Cambodia National Rescue Party leaders to Cambodia, including Sam Rainsy and Mu Sochua, in November 2019. He ordered the military to &quot;attack&quot; them on sight should they return, threatened airlines with legal actions for allowing them to board, deployed thousands of troops to the Thai and Vietnamese borders, and requested other ASEAN leaders arrest them and deport them to Cambodia.

In 2020, the European Union suspended its Everything but Arms preferential trade agreement with Cambodia due to concerns over human rights violations under Hun Sen&#x27;s government. Sen criticized the move as &quot;biased&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot;, including at the United Nations General Assembly in 2020.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hun Sen downplayed the risk of the virus and declined to introduce preventative measures or evacuate Cambodian citizens from Wuhan during the initial outbreak in China. It was widely reported this was in an attempt to show solidarity with China, one of Cambodia&#x27;s closest diplomatic and economic allies. Hun Sen visited China during the outbreak and offered to visit Wuhan specifically during its lockdown. In February 2020, at a press conference, he criticized the media for sensationalizing the virus, and threatened to expel those present who were wearing masks. Hun Sen was also present to welcome passengers of the &quot;MS Westerdam&quot; cruise ship to dock in Sihanoukville, after it was turned away from other countries. Cambodia started implementing preventative measures and travel restrictions from March 2020 as the pandemic spread globally.

A new State of Emergency Law prepared in response to COVID-19 granted Hun Sen further powers to restrict movement and assembly, seize private property and enforce quarantine. The new law has been criticised by Amnesty International for curbing human rights.

Ultimately, the government&#x27;s successful vaccination efforts and pandemic response were viewed by the Cambodian public as contributing to the perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of the government. A study conducted by IEAS found that more than 80% of those surveyed approved of the government response, with more than 25% strongly approving of the response.

On 10 July 2023, Hun Sen warned Ukraine of using cluster munitions, saying &quot;It would be the greatest danger for Ukrainians for many years or up to a hundred years if cluster bombs are used in Russian-occupied areas in the territory of Ukraine,&quot; Sen further cited his country&#x27;s &quot;painful experience&quot; from the Vietnam War that has killed or maimed tens of thousands of Cambodians.

Following controversy over the 23 July 2023 elections, the King confirmed that Hun Manet would succeed Hun Sen as prime minister.

=== Corruption and land issues ===

Hun Sen and his family were estimated to have amassed between US$500 million and US$1 billion by Global Witness in 2016, and a number of allies have also accumulated considerable personal wealth during his tenure.

Hun Sen implemented land reform, the &quot;leopard skin land reform&quot;, in Cambodia. Hun Sen&#x27;s government has been responsible for leasing 45% of the total landmass in Cambodia—primarily to foreign investors—in the years 2007–08, threatening more than 150,000 Cambodians with eviction. Parts of the concessions are protected wildlife areas or national parks and have driven deforestation across the country. As of 2015, Cambodia had one of the highest rates of forest loss in the world. The land sales have been perceived by observers as government corruption and have resulted in thousands of citizens being forcibly evicted. According to Alice Beban, the land reform strengthened patronage politics in Cambodia and did not enable land tenure security.

Hun Sen was implicated in corruption related to Cambodia&#x27;s oil wealth and mineral resources in the &quot;Global Witness&quot; 2009 report on Cambodia. He and his close associates were accused of carrying out secret negotiations with interested private parties, taking money from those who would be granted rights to exploit the country&#x27;s resources in return. The credibility of this accusation has been challenged by government officials and especially Prime Minister Hun Sen, himself.

=== Human rights issues ===

Sen and the CPP were accused of orchestrating summary executions during the 1997 coup.

Hun Sen frequently calls for violence against his political opponents during seemingly irrelevant public events, often characterizing this as necessary to maintain peace and stability in Cambodia. In 2017, he said he would be prepared to &quot;eliminate 100 or 200 people if they would destabilize the peace in Cambodia&quot; while speaking at commemoration for his defection from the Khmer Rouge. In 2019, as opposition party leaders prepared to return to the country, Sen ordered the military to &quot;attack them wherever you see them—you don&#x27;t need arrest warrants at all&quot; while speaking at a graduation ceremony for exceptional high school students in Phnom Penh. He also threatened the European Union if they withdrew a commercial deal: &quot;If you want the opposition dead, do it. If you want it alive, don&#x27;t do it and come and talk&quot;, although they did not give in. &quot;We didn&#x27;t pursue you because we didn&#x27;t want to kill you at the time,&quot; Hun Sen said to opposition leader Sam Rainsy, although such death threats have not been implemented.

Hun Sen&#x27;s Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP) has banned public gatherings, driven opposition supporters from the site of former protest meetings &#x27;Freedom Park&#x27;, and deployed riot police to beat protesters and detain union leaders.

Several Australian politicians, most prominently Gareth Evans and Julian Hill, have been highly critical of Sen and his government over human rights issues and have called for changes to Australia–Cambodia relations.

After the execution of 4 prisoners in July 2022 in Myanmar, Hun Sen warned to rethink the peace agreement if the regime continued to execute prisoners.

=== Foreign relations ===

Sen has frequently criticized Western powers such as the European Union and United States in response to their sanctions on Cambodia over human rights issues.

==== China ====

Sen strengthened a close diplomatic and economic relationship with China, which has undertaken large-scale infrastructure projects and investments in Cambodia under the Belt and Road Initiative.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, China provided major assistance to the Hun Sen government&#x27;s vaccination campaign. As of early November 2021, China had sent more than 35 million vaccines to Cambodia. China provided many of them free of charge. Vaccines provided by China accounted for more than 90% of total vaccines provided to Cambodia from other countries. China also provided other health care supplies as well as medical professionals to Cambodia during the pandemic. In part thanks to Chinese contributions, Cambodia had the second-highest vaccination rate in Southeast Asia, despite having the second lowest per capita GDP in the region.

==== Thailand ====

Sen oversaw a number of diplomatic disputes with neighboring Thailand.

The 2003 Phnom Penh riots resulted in the ransacking of the Thai embassy in Cambodia, following false allegations that a Thai soap opera actress Suvanant Punnakant claimed that Angkor Wat belonged to Thailand. Sen called for a boycott of Thai goods and television shows and criticized the actress shortly before the riots. The riots and Sen&#x27;s response severely damaged Cambodia–Thailand relations. Sen&#x27;s Thai counterpart Thaksin Shinawatra closed the borders, expelled the Cambodian ambassador and evacuated Thai citizens from Phnom Penh in response. Thaksin also sent a warning to Hun Sen after witness reports suggested the army and police had not intervened until the embassy was destroyed. Sam Rainsy accused Sen of inciting the riot.

From 2008 to 2013, the Cambodian–Thai border dispute was an ongoing conflict, which on a number of occasions led to fighting between Cambodian and Thai forces. Sen and Thai premier Abhisit Vejjajiva negotiated a de-escalation on several occasions with the encouragement of ASEAN. Cambodia was granted sovereignty over the Preah Vihear Temple area by a UN court in 2013, ending the dispute.

==== Myanmar ====
In his capacity as chairman of ASEAN, Sen became the first foreign leader to visit Myanmar following the 2021 coup d&#x27;état.

==== United States ====

In November 2016, Hun Sen publicly endorsed US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump who went on to be elected president.

==President of the Senate (2024–present)==

The Cambodian People&#x27;s Party claimed an expected landslide victory in the 2024 Senate election, paving the way for Hun Sen to become its president when the new Senate convenes. He resigned from his National Assembly seat on 2 April, allowing him to take his seat in the Senate. The full Senate unanimously confirmed him as president on 3 April.

==Public image==
In Cambodia, Hun Sen&#x27;s core support base is from the majority of the population who reside in the countryside and work in the agricultural sector. He is less popular in urban centers like Phnom Penh.

Hun Sen&#x27;s leadership has received criticism from various organizations, media and foreign governments for corruption, cronyism, environmental degradation, human rights violations and violence. Hun Sen and his government was described by former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew in 2000 as &quot;utterly merciless and ruthless, without humane feelings&quot;.
=== Alleged Vietnamese ties ===

Some political opponents of Hun Sen have criticized him for alleged ties to Vietnam. Norodom Sihanouk once referred to him as a &quot;one-eyed lackey of the Vietnamese&quot;, with Sam Rainsy and members of the Cambodia National Rescue Party later echoing similar sentiments during the 2010s. This is due to his position in the Vietnamese occupied government and prominence in figure in the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party of Kampuchea. Anti-Vietnamese sentiment and racism is common in Cambodia.

==Control of media==
Although Cambodia had relatively independent press during and immediately following the UNTAC era, Hun Sen and the CPP have since come to strictly control media in Cambodia. This has more recently encompassed social media, which surpassed traditional media as a news source for Cambodians in 2017.

=== Television, radio, and newspapers ===
Bayon Television is owned and operated by Hun Mana, Hun Sen&#x27;s eldest daughter. is joint-owned by Say Sam Al, CPP Minister of Environment and son of Say Chhum, CPP secretary and the son of CPP Deputy Prime Minister Sok An. CTN, CNC and MyTV are all owned by Khmer-Chinese tycoon, Kith Meng.

CPP officials claim that there is no connection between the TV stations and the state. However, CPP lawmaker and official spokesman Cheam Yeap once stated &quot;We pay for that television [coverage] by buying broadcasting hours to show our achievements&quot;.

A demand for television and radio licenses was one of 10 opposition requests adopted by the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) at its &quot;People&#x27;s Congress&quot; in October 2013.

Radio stations were banned from broadcasting &quot;Voice of America&quot; and &quot;Radio Free Asia&quot; in August 2017. The country&#x27;s most prominent independent newspaper &quot;Cambodia Daily&quot; was closed on 4 September 2017, a day after the main opposition leader Kem Sokha was arrested for treason. &quot;The Phnom Penh Post&quot;, another widely circulated independent newspaper, was sold to a Malaysian investor with ties to Hun Sen in 2018, which undermined its independence and aligned it closer to the government.

=== Social media and suspension from Facebook ===
Facebook and the internet became widely used in Cambodia during the 2010s. It is thought that its adoption by the Cambodia National Rescue Party played a role in the party&#x27;s gains in the 2013 election.

In the mid-2010s, Hun Sen and the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party became enthusiastic users of Facebook. Hun Sen declared in February 2016 they had become an &quot;electronic government&quot; and regularly posted and livestreams of speeches, announcements, and selfies to million of followers. In 2017, Hun Sen&#x27;s official page was the eighth-most liked Facebook page of any world leader and as of December 2020 was the most liked Facebook page in Cambodia.

Facebook activity in Cambodia is monitored by the authorities, and criticism of the government and prime minister on Facebook has led to several arrests in the country. Cambodia has also prosecuted women who post images of themselves wearing revealing clothing on Facebook, with Hun Sen saying it is &quot;a violation of culture and tradition&quot; and invites sexual harassment. Amnesty International criticized this speech, characterizing it as &quot;victim blaming&quot; and contributing to violence against women.

On 29 June 2023, Hun Sen deleted his Facebook account, which had approximately 14 million followers, hours after Meta&#x27;s oversight board ruled that he should face a six-month ban from the platform over a video post in which he threatened to have opponents beaten. On the following day, 30 June 2023, the Cambodian Ministry of Post and Telecommunications announced they would deport a Meta representative immediately and Cambodia would cease all cooperation with the company, attributing the move to an abundance of fake accounts, data risks, and lack of transparency. On 4 July 2023, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement that all of Meta&#x27;s Oversight Board&#x27;s 22 members were &quot;persona non-grata&quot;, barring them from entering the country because &quot;[t]he recommendation of the Oversight Board to Meta Platforms Inc. to temporarily suspend the official Facebook page belonging to Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen is political in nature. It intends to obstruct the freedom of the press for the citizens of Cambodia and the right to receive credible news from a leader whom they support and admire.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hun Sen is married to Bun Rany. They have 6 children, including one adopted daughter: Kamsot (deceased), Manet, Mana, Manith, Mani and Mali. The couple also adopted a daughter (who is not named in news media sources) in 1988, but they legally disowned her in 2007 for being lesbian. In 2010, Manet was promoted Major General in the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) and became the Deputy Commander of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Body Guard headquarters. All three of Hun Sen&#x27;s sons play big roles in his government. His older brother, Hun Neng, was a governor of Kampong Cham and a member of parliament.

Hun Sen is fluent in Vietnamese, in addition to his native Khmer. Hun Sen also speaks some English after beginning to learn the language in the 1990s, but usually converses in Khmer through interpreters when giving formal interviews to the English-speaking media.

Hun Sen is blind in one eye because of an injury he sustained during the fall of Phnom Penh while fighting for the Khmer Rouge. He is fitted with a Japanese made artificial eye, which is regularly replaced by Japanese doctors.

Hun Sen is a Buddhist. He has made major donations for the renovation of numerous pagodas, including Wat Vihear Suor.

Until June 2022, Hun Sen has used 4 April 1951 as his legal birthdate even if he was actually born on 5 August 1952. He had it changed due to a Cambodian superstition relating to having wrong legal birthdates causing conflict with the Chinese zodiac. A lot of Cambodians use two birthdates due to losing their birth certificates during the Khmer Rouge era of the 1970s. Hun Sen had it changed for believing the death of his brother in May 2022 due to a cardiac arrest was related to this superstition since he also had an incorrect birth date.

<text>Peter Mafany Musonge (born 3 December 1942) is a Cameroonian politician who was Prime Minister of Cameroon from September 19, 1996, to December 8, 2004.

==Biography==
Musonge musonge was born at Muea in the Fako Department of Cameroon&#x27;s South-West Region. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering at Drexel University and received a Master of Science degree in structural engineering at Stanford University, and has worked on a variety of development projects. He has been a longtime supporter and assistant of President Paul Biya, and is an Anglophone and a member of the Bakweri ethnic group. He left his position as Prime Minister after a cabinet reshuffle which followed Biya&#x27;s successful 2004 reelection, for which Musonge served as campaign manager.

Musonge is a member of the Central Committee of the ruling Cameroon People&#x27;s Democratic Movement (CPDM). Biya appointed Musonge as Grand Chancellor of National Orders on April 4, 2007.

In May 2013, President Biya appointed Musonge to the Senate of Cameroon. He was one of 30 senators to receive their seats by presidential appointment; the other 70 senators were indirectly elected. Biya appointed three senators for each region, and Musonge was one of the three to come from the South-West Region. There was some speculation that he might receive the post of President of the Senate, but Marcel Niat Njifenji was elected to that post on 12 June 2013. Musonge was instead designated as President of the CPDM&#x27;s Senate Parliamentary Group.

<text>José Maria Pereira Neves (; born 28 March 1960) is a Cape Verdean politician who is currently the president of Cape Verde, having previously served as the Prime Minister of Cape Verde from 2001 to 2016. He is a member of the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV). In the 2021 presidential election, he was elected with 51.7% of votes, beating his nearest rival Carlos Veiga who got 42.4% of the total votes.

==Biography==
Neves was born on the island of Santiago in 1960. He became interested in the politics of Cape Verde as a teenager and was the leader of a nationalist youth organization during the country&#x27;s transition from Portuguese rule to independence and democracy in 1975. Part of his higher education was at the São Paulo School of Business Administration of the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in Brazil.

He returned to Cape Verde in the 1980s and worked as a clerk in different state institutions. From 1987 to 1989, he was coordinator of the Project Administrative and Reform and Modernization. From 1988 to 1988, he was director of the National Training Centre for Public Administration. From 1989 to 1998, he was consultant in the field of National Training and Development of Human Resources Management.

===Political career===
In 1989, he became member of the PAICV party. As a candidate for the party leadership at PAICV&#x27;s September 1997 congress, he faced Pedro Pires; Pires defeated Neves in the leadership election, winning 68% of the vote. In May 2000, Neves—then serving as President of the Santa Catarina Town Council—announced that he would seek the PAICV presidency again at the June 2000 party congress; Pires was leaving the PAICV presidency in anticipation of his candidacy in the next year&#x27;s national presidential election.

After he became prime minister, he established diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 2002, he signed a &quot;special treaty&quot; with the European Union, it was discussed on 15 November 2005. In 2007, he called for a special relationship with the European Union due to the archipelago&#x27;s proximity to the other islands of Macaronesia, which are regions of Spain and Portugal. A meeting with the CPLP (Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries) was held in November 2002. He also met Alamara Nhassé, Prime Minister of Guinea-Bissau. He held additional portfolio of Minister of Finance from 2003 to 2004.

In August 2005, he visited Brazil, where he toured six states and had an audience with President Lula da Silva. A topic of discussion was investment in Cape Verde, including in the University of Cape Verde, the first public university in the archipelago.

He won the 2006 parliamentary election on 22 January with 52.28% of the votes and got 41 seats. and on 7 March, he served his second term as prime minister. The World Bank and the IMF judged favorably on its economic and financial policies.

While acknowledging the harmful effects of slavery and colonialism on Africa, Neves said in December 2006 that African leaders were primarily responsible for the continent&#x27;s present-day problems, and that they &quot;must assume their responsibility to develop a clear strategy for Africa&#x27;s future that takes advantage of all of its human capabilities and natural resources.&quot;

On 2 January 2007, he wanted to give Cape Verde a special status with ECOWAS.

A new government under Neves was announced on 27 June 2008, with six ministers joining the government and four ministers leaving it. Three of the new ministers were women, making it the first government in Cape Verde with a female majority (eight out of 15 portfolios).

On 6 February 2011, he was elected to his third term by most Cape Verdean voters with 52.68% over MpD and 38 out of 72 seats, thus reinforcing his party&#x27;s influence in the Cape Verdean parliament.

He visited a trading conference, the 4th Global Review of Aid for Trade in from 8 to 10 July 2013.

On 6 September 2014, he announced another government. Janira Hopffer Almada succeeded Neves as president of the parliamentary section of the PAICV party. After the 2016 parliamentary elections on 22 April, he was succeeded by Ulisses Correia e Silva as prime minister.

In October 2021, José Maria Neves, won the presidential election in the first round of 17 October. According to the first results published on an official website, he won 51.5% of the vote, an absolute majority necessary to be elected in the first round.

<doc id="393786" wikidata="Q3293420" url="?curid=393786" title="Mario Dumont">
<text>Mario Dumont (born May 19, 1970) is a Canadian television personality and former politician in Quebec, Canada. He was a Member of the National Assembly of Quebec (MNA), and the leader of the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ), from 1994 to 2009. After the 2007 Quebec election, Dumont obtained the post of Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly.

Following his party&#x27;s poor showing in the 2008 Quebec election, he announced his resignation as ADQ leader, and subsequently joined the television network V to host a daily news and talk show, &quot;Dumont&quot;, which began in 2009. He left that network in 2012 to join the all-news channel LCN.

==Biography==
Dumont was born in Saint-Georges-de-Cacouna, Quebec. Dumont and his wife, Marie-Claude Barrette, have three children: Angela, Charles, and Juliette. Dumont obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Concordia University in 1993, and completed some graduate work at the Université de Montréal.

==Political career==

===Quebec Liberal Party===
Dumont bought his first membership card in the Liberal Party of Quebec at age 15. He stated to his school friends that in the future he would be Quebec&#x27;s premier.
Dumont was a former President of the Liberal Party&#x27;s Youth Commission, but had a falling out with the party following the rejection of the Allaire Report proposing maximalist powers for Quebec after the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord.

Dumont called himself and Michel Bissonnet, who preceded Dumont as leader of the Liberal youth wing, &quot;the first Liberal sovereigntists&quot;. This was the group that led the Liberal sovereigntist faction while Liberal premier Robert Bourassa remained unopposed.

Dumont organized the &quot;Liberals for the No side,&quot; in the 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown Accord.

===Action démocratique du Québec===
Dumont and Liberal party insider Jean Allaire played a central role in the creation and development of the Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ) in 1994. He succeeded Allaire as leader after the latter resigned for health reasons.

Dumont was elected as an ADQ member of the National Assembly for Rivière du Loup in the 1994, 1998, 2003, 2007 and 2008 elections.

In the 1995 Quebec referendum, Dumont joined with Parti Québécois Premier Jacques Parizeau and Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard, who wooed him and with whom he remains close, in support of the sovereigntist campaign. Dumont revealed to Journalist Chantal Hébert and Jean Lapierre that they planned to use 1995 Quebec Referendum as a way to advocate for a new partnership between Quebec and Canada. However, Parizeau advocated for separation; so both Bouchard and Dumont followed his direction. In subsequent years, however he changed positions on the issue, arguing that the sovereignty question had been decided and that Quebecers had no desire to revisit it.

In the years that followed, the constitutional position of the ADQ changed to favour Quebec autonomism, supporting increased powers and responsibilities for Quebec while remaining within Canada. In practical terms, Dumont has supported the creation of a Quebec constitution, the change of the province&#x27;s name to that of the &quot;autonomous state of Québec&quot;, and the collection of all taxes by the provincial government, with the funds necessary for the federal government to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities being transferred to it by the province.

Since the 1998 provincial election, Dumont has distinguished himself primarily for his stances on economic issues, which are generally considered to be right of centre in the context of the predominantly social-democratic Quebec political scene. He advocates the payment of a cash allowance to parents who do not wish to make use of the province&#x27;s $7 a day daycare program, changes to the provincial health system that would allow private for profit health care and private health insurance alongside the public system, the abolition of school boards, the encouragement of private education, a tougher criminal justice system, reductions in the size of the provincial bureaucracy, and the repayment of the province&#x27;s $127 billion government debt.

Dumont was personally very popular, and for most of his career was far more popular than the ADQ as a whole. In fact, for many years, the ADQ tried to capitalize on Dumont&#x27;s personal popularity by using the official name (Action démocratique du Québec-Team Mario Dumont}. However, this didn&#x27;t translate to support for his party; it never won much support in Montreal or the Outaouais.

====2007 Quebec election====
In the 2007 Quebec election, the ADQ won 41 seats with 31% of the popular vote, and formed the Official Opposition in the National Assembly. Prior to the dissolution of the National Assembly, the ADQ had held only five seats, and as a result did not have official party status. Despite becoming the Official Opposition, the ADQ was almost nonexistent in several of the province&#x27;s major cities. It won almost no seats in Montreal, Gatineau, Saguenay, Longueuil, Laval and Sherbrooke. Tasha Kheiriddin argued that his result would have given right-of-centre currents swirling in Quebec politics.

====2008 Quebec election====
On October 23, 2008, two ADQ MNAs, André Riedl and Pierre-Michel Auger, crossed the floor to the governing Liberal Party, embarrassing Dumont. Quebec premier Jean Charest subsequently called a snap election for December 8, 2008. A Léger Marketing poll conducted between Friday, November 14 and Monday, November 17, showed the Liberals with 44% support, the PQ with 33%, and the ADQ with 15%.

The ADQ won a meagre seven seats (17% of the vote) in the election. Following this poor showing, Dumont retired from politics on election night.

==Television career==

At TQS&#x27; 2009 upfronts presentation, it was announced that Dumont would join the network in the fall as host of a daily news and information series, &quot;Dumont 360&quot;. The series launched in September 2009, shortly after the network was rebranded as V.

In 2012, Dumont moved to LCN and began a new show called .

Since 2018, he has also hosted his own radio show, , on QUB Radio.

<text>Wolfgang Heidenfeld (; 29 May 1911 – 3 August 1981) was a German chess player and chess composer.

Heidenfeld was born in Berlin. He was forced to move from Germany to South Africa in the 1930s because he was a Jew. There, he won the South African Chess Championship eight times, and he represented South Africa in the Chess Olympiad in 1958. Besides playing chess, he was also a writer, door-to-door salesman, journalist, and designer of crossword puzzles. His hobbies were poker, bridge and collecting stamps as well as playing chess. During World War II, he used his fluency in German to help decode German messages for the Allies. Despite having so many different interests and activities to engage into, he nevertheless managed to succeed in chess to the point of becoming national champion in both of the countries he lived in.

In 1955, he beat former world champion Max Euwe. He also won games against Miguel Najdorf, Joaquim Durao and Ludek Pachman. He never became an International Master—he did eventually attain the required qualifications but declined to accept the award from FIDE.

He wrote several chess books, including &quot;Chess Springbok&quot; (1955), &quot;My Book of Fun and Games&quot; (1958), &quot;Grosse Remispartien&quot; (1968; in German; an English edition entitled &quot;Draw!&quot;, edited by John Nunn, was published in 1982), and &quot;Lacking the Master Touch&quot; (1970).

In 1957, after visiting Ireland, he moved to Dublin. In 1979, the family moved back to Ulm, where he died two years later.

Heidenfeld was Irish Champion in 1958, 1963, 1964, 1967, 1968, and 1972.
He won the Leinster Chess Championship in 1965, 1969 (shared), and 1972.
He was in the Olympiad team in 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1974; and in the European Championships team in 1967.

His son Mark Heidenfeld is an International Master, has also played chess for Ireland, and won the Irish Chess Championship in 2000 and 2021.

The Heidenfeld Trophy, the second division, of the Leinster chess league, is named in his honour.

<doc id="393789" wikidata="Q318433" url="?curid=393789" title="Abel Goumba">
<text>Abel Nguéndé Goumba (; 18 September 1926 – 11 May 2009) was a Central African politician. During the late 1950s, he headed the government in the period prior to independence from France, and following independence he was an unsuccessful candidate for President of the Central African Republic four times (1981, 1993, 1999, and 2005). Goumba, who was President of the Patriotic Front for Progress (FPP) political party, served under President François Bozizé as Prime Minister from March 2003 to December 2003 and then as Vice President of the Central African Republic from December 2003 to March 2005. Subsequently, he was appointed to the official post of Ombudsman.

==Early life==
He was born in 1926 in Grimari, Ouaka Prefecture in the Oubangi-Chari French colony, which is now the Central African Republic. He was a qualified medical doctor and member of the medical faculty in Bangui.

==Entry into politics and exile (1957-1981)==
While the country was still a French colony, Goumba was Vice-President of the Government Council from May 1957 to July 1958, President of the Government Council from July to December 1958, and was briefly Prime Minister in an acting capacity in April 1959, following the death of Barthélemy Boganda in a plane crash. However, Goumba was seen as too nationalistic and anti-French, which led France to promote their loyal ally David Dacko instead. Dacko won the ensuing power struggle in 1959 and dismissed Goumba as Minister of Finance; he went on to become the independent country&#x27;s first president.

In 1960, Goumba and went on to found a small opposition party, the &quot;Mouvement d&#x27;évolution démocratique de l&#x27;Afrique centrale&quot; (MEDAC). When MEDAC won substantial support in by-elections, Dacko declared the party illegal and arrested its leadership. Goumba, along with two close associates, was sentenced to life imprisonment in February 1962 by the Supreme Court, which still consisted entirely of French magistrates. Goumba managed to go in exile in France, where he completed his medical studies. He worked for the World Health Organization in Rwanda and then Benin during the 1970s; while in Rwanda, he met his wife, Anne-Marie, who was then a professor at the Butare Faculty of Medicine. Maleombho, the co-founder of the MEDAC, was executed by the Bokassa regime in 1976.

==Dacko and Kolingba era (1981-1993)==
At the time of the 1979 French coup which deposed military dictator Bokassa, Goumba was still in exile. However, he had the backing of a new, émigré opposition party behind him, the &quot;Front patriotique oubanguien&quot;, which he had founded in 1972. When handpicking a successor to Bokassa, France immediately discarded Goumba due to his perceived Marxist ideas and his revolutionary past. Instead, the French installed Dacko again. When voices in the CAR were raised for the return of Goumba, the French right-wing press launched a campaign against him, painting him as an agent of the Soviet Union. Goumba and the &quot;Front patriotique&quot; reacted by denouncing French interference in Central African politics and demanding the departure of French troops.

After his 1981 return to the Central African Republic, Goumba was again occasionally arrested for political activity. He feuded with all of Central African Republic&#x27;s presidents until 2003 and was declared by them to be a national traitor. In the 1981 election, his &quot;Front patriotique&quot; won a mere 1,44% of the vote. The Kolingba regime, which came into power a few months later by overthrowing Dacko in the 1981 coup, kept Goumba and other political opponents under close surveillance and excluded them from formal politics.

Goumba swiftly returned to politics with the comeback of electoral democracy in the early &#x27;90s. The &quot;Front patriotique&quot; was relaunched as the Patriotic Front for Progress (FPP) in 1991.

==Patassé era (1993-2003)==
In the 1993 presidential election Goumba achieved his best result, coming in second place but being defeated by Ange-Félix Patassé in a run-off, in which Goumba took 46,51% of the vote. Reminiscing about this era, American ambassador Robert Gribbin described Goumba as &quot;more of a &#x27;60s style revolutionary than anyone else&quot; in the political landscape at the time. He also had a reputation for honesty and integrity, and stressed the importance of governing without corruption.

In the 1999 election he did poorly by comparison, taking only 6,56% of the vote and placing fourth, behind Patassé, Kolingba and Dacko.

==Bozizé era (2003-2006)==
After François Bozizé seized power on 15 March 2003, ousting Patassé, he appointed Goumba as Prime Minister on 23 March. His government was formed on 31 March 2003; in its composition it was viewed as a compromise between Bozizé and Goumba, with a number of military allies and relatives of Bozizé receiving key posts while other posts went to associates and allies of various political leaders and to independent figures regarded as competent. Goumba kept the portfolio of Minister of Finance himself. The National Transitional Council (CNT) rejected Goumba&#x27;s proposed programme of general policy on 5 November 2003, saying that the government&#x27;s objectives, along with the methods of implementing those objectives, were not sufficiently defined in the programme. He had planned to submit a revised programme on 12 December 2003, but on 11 December, Bozizé dismissed him as Prime Minister. On the next day Célestin Gaombalet was named to replace him; Goumba was appointed as Vice-President instead.

He was a presidential candidate for the fourth time in the 2005 election. Goumba was not expected to win; he received sixth place and 2.51% of the vote. He was one of the five candidates initially approved by the transitional constitutional court on 30 December 2004; seven other candidates were excluded, although six of them were later allowed to run.

On 14 March 2005, the day after the election, members of the Collective of Political Parties of the Opposition (CPPO), including Goumba, signed a petition in which they alleged that fraud had occurred. On 15 March, before the election results became available, Bozizé dismissed Goumba from the Vice-Presidency and the position was abolished. According to presidential spokesman Alain-George Ngatoua, this was because the constitution adopted in December 2004 did not provide for a Vice-President, and the dismissal was unrelated to the quality of Goumba&#x27;s work; Ngatoua said that Bozizé thanked Goumba for facilitating the transitional process through his &quot;wisdom and courage&quot;. Goumba expressed disgust at the manner of his dismissal; he said that he had received no notification of the dismissal and found out about it when it was reported on state radio. Goumba&#x27;s view was that transitional institutions, including the Vice-Presidency, were supposed to be maintained until the installation of an elected government.

Goumba ran for a seat from Kouango in the 2005 parliamentary election, held concurrently with the presidential election, but was defeated; his wife Anne-Marie won a seat, however.

==Retirement and death==
Goumba&#x27;s son Alexandre was elected to succeed him as president of the FPP on 5 March 2006, after the elder Goumba was appointed to the official post of Ombudsman. As Ombudsman, he called for the government to negotiate with a rebel group after it captured Birao on 30 October 2006.

He presented the first volume of his memoirs, covering the period from 1956 to 1959, on 14 January 2007.

Goumba died at age 82 on 11 May 2009 at a clinic in Bangui after being taken to hospital the previous evening.

<text>Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum (; 15 August 1943 – 4 January 2006) was an Emirati royal and politician who served as the second vice president, first and third prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, and ruler of Dubai. He was prime minister from 1971 to 1979 and from 1990 to 2006. He served as the ruler of Dubai from 1990 to 2006. He was succeeded after his death by his brother Sheikh Mohammed as Ruler of Dubai.

==Early life ==
He was born in 1943 in Al Shindagha, Dubai to the Al Maktoum family of the Al Bu Falasah tribe. 

==Political career==
His father Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum became the Ruler of Dubai upon the death of his own father, Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum (Saeed II), in 1958. Sheikh Maktoum formed the first cabinet of the United Arab Emirates. He served as prime minister first from the country&#x27;s independence on 9 December 1971 until 25 April 1979, when he was replaced by his father, who had been Vice President since 1971. Following his father&#x27;s death on 7 October 1990, he resumed his position as Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, and also took over as Ruler of Dubai and Vice President of the United Arab Emirates. He served in all three positions until his death on 4 January 2006.

Sheikh Maktoum also briefly served as acting President of the United Arab Emirates on 2–3 November 2004 between the death of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and the proclamation and installation of his son Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan as President of the United Arab Emirates on 4 November 2004.

Sheikh Maktoum ran the emirate of Dubai along with his two brothers, Sheikh Mohammed (Crown Prince and Minister of Defence) and Sheikh Hamdan (Minister of Finance) of the United Arab Emirates. Internationally, he was also known as co-owner (with his brothers) of Dubai&#x27;s Godolphin Stables, which competes in major horse races around the world.

==Death==
Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al Maktoum died on the morning of 4 January 2006, suffering a heart attack while staying at Palazzo Versace Hotel in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. He was succeeded by his brother, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, as ruler of Dubai. His body was brought back from Australia and buried in Dubai.

==Personal life==
Sheikha Alia bint Khalifa Al Maktoum was Al Maktoum&#x27;s wife until his death in 2006. They married on 12 March 1971. Sheikha Alia, like other members of the Maktoum family, is involved in horse racing. 

One of Al Maktoum&#x27;s daughters with Alia bint Khalifa bin Saeed Al Maktoum, is Lateefa bint Maktoum Al Maktoum (born 11 February 1985). Sheikha Lateefa bint Maktoum is the founder of the art centre Tashkeel Dubai. Sheikha Alia&#x27;s other children are Sheikha Hessa, Sheikha Maitha, Sheikh Saeed, and Sheikh Rashid (1979–2002). 

=== Age of consent allegations ===
In 2023, the &quot;New Yorker&quot; reported on allegations by multiple drivers that Sheikh Maktoum travelled on private jets with underage girls.

=== Sheikha Bouchra ===
Sheikha Bouchra bint Mohammed was Al Maktoum&#x27;s second wife and had three sons named Sheikh Mohammed, Sheikh Hamdan, and Sheikh Zayed with him. She was a hobbyist painter and a horse racing enthusiast. Bouchra&#x27;s lifestyle conflicted with the traditional customs and strictures on female royalty in the UAE. In April 2000, there were allegations that Bouchra had been abducted by the Emirati government while she was the United Kingdom, forcefully bringing her to Dubai where she was made a house prisoner. She apparently died in 2007, aged 34, not long after her husband&#x27;s death.

<text>Moussa Faki Mahamat (&quot;, &quot;; born 21 June 1960) is a Chadian politician and diplomat who has been the elected Chairperson of the African Union Commission since 14 March 2017. Previously he was Prime Minister of Chad from 24 June 2003 to 4 February 2005 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from April 2008 to January 2017. Faki, a member of the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), belongs to the Zaghawa ethnic group, the same group as the late President Idriss Déby.

On 6 February 2021, he was re-elected as Chairperson of the African Union Commission for another four year term from 2021–2024.

==Biography==
Faki was born in the town of Biltine in eastern Chad. He attended university in Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo, where he studied law. He went into exile when Hissein Habré took power on June 7, 1982 and joined the Democratic Revolutionary Council headed by Acheikh Ibn Oumar; however, he did not return to Chad when Acheikh joined with Habré in 1988. He eventually returned on 7 June 1991, after Déby took power. He was director-general of two ministries before serving as the Director-General of the National Sugar Company (SONASUT) between 1996 and 1999.

Subsequently, he served as Director of the Cabinet of President Déby from March 1999 to July 2002, and he was Déby&#x27;s campaign director for the May 2001 presidential election. Faki was then appointed as Minister of Public Works and Transport in the government of Prime Minister Haroun Kabadi, which was named on June 12, 2002. After a year in that post, he was appointed as Prime Minister by Déby on June 24, 2003, replacing Kabadi. Faki resigned in early February 2005 amidst a civil service strike and a rumored quarrel with Déby.

Faki was nominated as a member of the Economic, Social and Cultural Council on 19 January 2007, and was then elected as the Council&#x27;s President in mid-February 2007. In the government of Prime Minister Youssouf Saleh Abbas, which was announced on April 23, 2008, he was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Hissein Brahim Taha was appointed to replace him as Chadian Minister of Foreign Affairs on 5 February 2017. Faki took office as Chairperson of the AU Commission on 14 March 2017.

<doc id="393795" wikidata="Q315467" url="?curid=393795" title="Ivica Račan">
<text>Ivica Račan (; 24 February 1944 – 29 April 2007) was a Croatian politician who served as Prime Minister of Croatia from 2000 to 2003, heading two centre-left coalition governments.

Račan became the first prime minister of Croatia not to be a member of the Croatian Democratic Union, namely the opposition coalition headed by his Social Democratic Party won the 2000 parliamentary election and came to power for the first time since independence. He was the leader of the party, the successor of the League of Communists of Croatia, from 1990 to 2007.

Before becoming prime minister, Račan served in the capacity of Leader of the Opposition on two occasions: firstly, from the first multi-party elections in May 1990 until the formation of a national unity government under Franjo Gregurić in July 1991; and secondly, from his defeat in the 2003 general election by Ivo Sanader until his death on 29 April 2007.

==Early life==
Račan was born on 24 February 1944 in Ebersbach, Nazi Germany, where his mother Marija Draženović was interned in a labor camp during World War II. He and his mother survived the Allied bombing of Dresden and were buried for days in the basement of a collapsed building. After the war, Račan returned to Croatia and spent his childhood and adolescence in Slavonski Brod, before moving to Zagreb and enrolling at the University of Zagreb. In 1970 he graduated from the Zagreb Faculty of Law.

==Political career==
===Early career (1961–1989)===
Račan entered politics in the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia in 1961 as a member of the League of Communists of Croatia (SKH), the Croatian branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ). He was president of the communist youth organization in the Slavonski Brod gymnasium. From 1963 to 1974 he worked for the Yugoslav institute of social research where he studied and researched the topic of Workers&#x27; self-management. In 1972, his professional political career began when he entered the central committee of the Croatian league of communists after 6 seats were made available because those 6 previous officials were involved in the 1971 Croatian Spring. He was a member of the SKH culture committee and the head ideology commissioner. From 1982 to 1986, he was director of the &quot;Josip Broz Tito&quot; political school in Kumrovec. In 1986 he was elected to represent SKH in the presidency of the Yugoslav league of communists in Belgrade.

In the late 1980s during the Anti-bureaucratic revolution, tensions grew between pro-Milošević and anti-Milošević supporters so in autumn 1989 the Croatian communists elected Račan as the president of SKH because he defended the rights of republic autonomies which the Milošević establishment wanted to abolish.
Račan led the Croatian delegation at the 14th SKJ party congress, held in late January 1990. The congress was dominated by Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s supporters and the Slovenian and Croatian delegations were continuously outvoted in trying to reach a compromise on the political future of Yugoslavia, their proposals of various political reforms and amendments to the Constitution, aiming primarily on decentralizing the federation, all being rejected. Finally the Slovenian delegation declared that they were abandoning the congress. Milošević tried to persuade Račan to stay, but Račan replied that a communist party without the Slovenes was unacceptable. Without the Croatian delegation, it was impossible to reconvene the congress. &quot;(Adam Le Bor: Milošević)&quot;

===Opposition years (1990–1999)===
Under his leadership, SKH re-branded themselves as the Party of Democratic Reform ( or SDP) in February 1990 and then ran in the 1990 election as SKH-SDP, winning 26 percent of the votes and coming in second behind the right-wing Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). During the 1990 election campaign, Račan stirred some controversy when he referred to HDZ as a &quot;party of dangerous intentions&quot;.

Although his party had lost the election, they remained the second largest party in the Sabor, and Račan thus continued his political career as the first Leader of the Opposition in the history of modern Croatia. SKH-SDP, however, quickly became a shadow of its former self – a majority of its membership, including the highest-ranking officials, defected to HDZ, while the breakup of Yugoslavia, the rebellion of ethnic Serbs and the ensuing war which broke out in 1991 further radicalised the Croatian public. In such circumstances, Račan was more concerned with the survival of his party rather than challenging Franjo Tuđman&#x27;s rule, even if it meant tolerating some of Tuđman&#x27;s more controversial policies, like the nationalisation of workers&#x27; owned enterprises and privatisation.

In such circumstances, Račan gave up the opposition leader title to Dražen Budiša of the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS). SDP then barely managed to pass the threshold in the following 1992 general election, but it did succeed in establishing itself as the strongest social democratic option. In 1994, SDP incorporated the minor Social Democrats of Croatia (SDH) party and soon became one of the two main alternatives to Tuđman, along with HSLS. The same year, Miko Tripalo, who was chairman of the Social Democratic Action of Croatia (SDAH) tried to force an all-left party coalition on the Croatian political spectrum but Račan and the SDP head committee rejected the idea and thus later becoming the only major left party.

Following the end of the war of independence in 1995, Croatian voters were becoming more concerned with social issues, and in such circumstances, SDP gradually began to consolidate support at the expense of other opposition parties, most notably the social liberals, HSLS. This became evident in the 1995 general elections. SDP finished second in the 1997 Croatian presidential election which gave them the status of the main opposition party.

===Prime Minister (2000–2003)===
In August 1998, Račan and Budiša signed a coalition agreement and later won the 2000 elections, dislodging HDZ from power after a decade.

Following the election, Račan became Prime Minister of Croatia and formed a six-party centre-left government with ministers from SDP, HSLS, the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the Liberal Party (LS), the Croatian People&#x27;s Party (HNS), and the Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS).

Račan, like the newly elected president Stjepan Mesić, was initially hailed as a new, reformist leader who would symbolize the break with Croatia&#x27;s authoritarian and nationalist past. While a democrat, Račan was, however, inefficient in running a government comprising six parties, the first coalition in modern Croatian history. His style of governance, sometimes described by the phrase &quot;&quot;Odlučno možda&quot; (&quot;Decisively maybe&quot;&quot; in English), plagued his government with factional struggles. Račan had to adopt a compromise-making attitude which limited the government&#x27;s ability to commit fully to what should be done.

Račan faced problems when his main coalition partner Budiša lost in the 2000 Croatian presidential election. This made Budiša lose any significant role in the government so he became frustrated and started making trouble.
This led to the break-up with Budiša who took a more nationalist approach to dealing with the issues of ICTY indictments against Croatian Army generals. This rift began to affect Račan&#x27;s government on other issues. IDS was the first to leave the coalition in June 2001.

Račan formally resigned on 5 July 2002, after their coalition partner HSLS obstructed the ratification of a vital agreement with Slovenia on the status of the co-owned Krško Nuclear Power Plant. This led to a party split which saw the main faction of HSLS leave the ruling coalition and a dissenting faction which formed a new party called LIBRA which opted to stay in the government. This enabled Račan to form a slightly modified government that would remain in power until the next elections in 2003.

Račan&#x27;s best achievements were in foreign policy. He successfully brought Croatia out of the semi-isolation of the Tuđman era and set the country on the road towards membership of the European Union. During his term as prime minister, the Constitution of Croatia was amended, turning Croatia from a semi-presidential system to a parliamentary democracy and granting more power to the parliament and prime minister. Among other things, Račan opened up the government&#x27;s workings to the public with an &quot;open-doors day&quot; at the government and scheduled regular press conferences, which was in sharp contrast to previous governments who for the most part shunned media attention. Račan visited Bleiburg, Austria, in 2002 and attended the annual commemoration of the Bleiburg repatriations.

During his term in office, Croatia also changed economically. The opening to the West brought fresh inflows of capital which helped jump-start Croatia&#x27;s GDP growth, amounting to around 5% per year during the years of the Račan government – high compared to previous years. The government also undertook a series of reforms in the public and government sectors and started large building projects, such as an affordable housing program and the construction of the A1 highway connecting the two biggest cities Zagreb and Split, which had been long-desired due to its importance for tourism. During this period, Račan also began to heal the rifts between Croatia and its neighbour Serbia and other former Yugoslav republics.

He also endured much criticism during that time when it came to the ICTY investigations. On the right-wing political spectrum he was attacked as being non-patriotic and a traitor to the national interests while on the liberal-left spectrum he was accused of not doing enough in fighting right-wing extremism and doing little on ensuring de-Tudjmanisation. In February 2001, he faced a massive public uproar when the indictment from ICTY came for Mirko Norac, who at the time was a runaway. The incident came to a peak when 100,000 people came to protest on the Split Riva against the government and a fear of a Coup d&#x27;état was at stake. The incident was calmed down when Račan made a deal with Carla Del Ponte which assured that Norac would be prosecuted in Croatia.

In July 2001, came the indictment for Ante Gotovina but Račan delayed accepting it because he felt that some parts of the indictment were wrongly written and negative about the Croatian War of Independence. Since Gotovina was not arrested or even under surveillance during that time, he made his escape to exile which lasted until his arrest in 2005. It was a heavy blow in the Croatian negotiations process with the EU. The last major ICTY scandal happened in September 2002 when the indictment for Janko Bobetko came. Bobetko at the time was in a bad health condition, so he refused to leave his home and surrounded himself with armed people. Račan was afraid that if Bobetko died during the transport to The Hague, it would cause a national riot with the right-wing population. Račan rejected the indictment and Croatia faced a risk of international isolation at that point. Račan persuaded Bobetko to leave his house and go to the hospital. The situation was tense until April 2003 when Bobetko died. After his death, the indictment was dropped and Croatia continued with the negotiations.

Račan was also criticized for his ratification agreement with Slovenia over the Gulf of Piran in 2001. Račan attempted to improve relations with Slovenia which were needed for the EU negotiations so he made an agreement which gave Slovenia 80% of the gulf territory and an exit in international waters but Croatia would still have the border with Italy. The agreement was heavily attacked by the public and the parliament speaker at the time, Zlatko Tomčić, claims that he did not know how much territory was given to Slovenia until the new gulf map came out in the newspaper &quot;Slobodna Dalmacija&quot;. The agreement was later rejected and not signed by the prime minister so it never came to a realization.

===Back in opposition (2003–2006)===
Račan&#x27;s centre-left coalition lost its majority in parliament following the November 2003 election. SDP did not create a big coalition like in the previous elections which cost them the votes. HSS decided to go alone and join the party which won the elections. Those tactics proved to be devastating for them. The coalition with HNS was rejected by Račan for reasons unknown which also proved to be a mistake. Račan conceded the defeat soon after election results were announced. His former coalition partners attacked him for conceding victory so early because they thought that they could try to enforce another great coalition but Račan said that it was unlikely to happen and even if it would happen, there would be no stability in such a great gathering. He officially ceased to be prime minister on 23 December 2003 when the Croatian Parliament approved his successor, Ivo Sanader of the HDZ, to take up that post.

SDP remained the most popular opposition party in opinion polls, and Ivica Račan was viewed as the leader of Croatian opposition. While viewed as indecisive as prime minister, he proved to be very skilful in maintaining SDP party leadership for over fifteen years. In 2006, Račan publicly stated that he had no intention of running for a new term as party president.

==Illness and death==
On 31 January 2007, Račan announced that he would temporarily leave public life for health reasons. SDP vice-president Željka Antunović took over as chairperson of the party. His health began to deteriorate and was diagnosed with cancer in his shoulder. In February, Račan underwent two surgeries to remove cancer from his kidney, urinary tract, and shoulder. On 4 April it was announced that tests showed metastases in his brain. On 11 April he stepped down as leader of SDP. Translation of his resignation follows:

On the morning of 12 April 2007, his condition was described as &quot;critical&quot; due to complications which occurred after he had a couple of surgical procedures to remove the cancer in his right shoulder. That same day, Zagreb radio station &quot;Radio 101&quot; wrongly reported his death based on &quot;unofficial information from two sources within the party&quot;, but SDP officials denied this. After that, he was reported to be in a critical condition, unable to communicate and under heavy sedation.

On 29 April 2007 at 3:05 am, Ivica Račan died at the Clinical Hospital Centre Zagreb. The reported cause of death was kidney cancer that had spread to his brain. He was buried on 2 May, at the Mirogoj Cemetery crematory. Per his request, only twelve closest friends and members of the family (including wife and both sons) were present. A separate commemoration was organized by SDP at the Lisinski Concert Hall, which was attended by the president, prime minister, a host of other dignitaries and many party members.

Throughout the three months of Račan&#x27;s illness, the Croatian media regularly reported on his status due to the huge public interest. Račan himself made no public appearances after the day he announced his illness, but the media was regularly informed through SDP&#x27;s spokespeople. This was a situation previously unknown in Croatia, particularly in comparison to the death of the late President Tuđman, when the details of his illness had been well guarded.

When Račan resigned as the party leader, he made no indication as to his preference for his successor but instead requested that an election convention be held, where the new leader would be elected by the party membership. Because of the upcoming November 2007 election, this was widely speculated to be relevant for party&#x27;s poll results.

==Personal life==
Račan married three times and had two sons, Ivan and Zoran, from his first marriage. His first wife Agata Špišić was a judge with the Croatian Constitutional Court. His second wife Jelena Nenadić was a librarian in the Kumrovec political school during the 1980s, and his third wife Dijana Pleština was a professor of political science at the College of Wooster in Ohio. He was a self-declared agnostic.

<text>Vladimír Špidla (; born 22 April 1951) is a Czech politician who served as the prime minister of the Czech Republic from July 2002 to August 2004 and as European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities from November 2004 to February 2010. He also served as chief adviser to Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka from 2014 to 2017.

==Early life==
Born in Prague, Špidla studied history at Charles University. His thesis was &quot;Založení Živnostenské banky&quot; (Establishment of the Entrepreneurial Bank). After his graduation in 1976, he worked in several different jobs, including menial ones, as he refused to fulfil political obligations necessary for access to better employment. He also worked as an archaeologist.

==Political career==
Špidla entered local politics in his hometown of Jindřichův Hradec after the Velvet Revolution, joining the re-established Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD, then called &quot;Czechoslovak Social Democracy&quot;). In 1991–1996 he served as the director of the district labour office. In 1992, he became a member of the Presidium of ČSSD, in March 1997 its statutory vice-chairman, and in April 2001 chairman of ČSSD after the previous chairman Miloš Zeman resigned. He was elected to parliament in 1996, and was First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in the government of Miloš Zeman from 22 July 1998 to 12 July 2002.

He was appointed prime minister on 12 July 2002 in the coalition government of ČSSD and the smaller Christian Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Party and Freedom Union-Democratic Union. During that time, he also held Presidential powers from 2 February 2003 until 7 March 2003, as the presidential term ended before the Parliament could elect a new one. His government proposed some reformed to address the growing budget deficit, but their proposals were criticised by the opposition being too mild, as well as focusing too much on tax increases rather than spending cuts. Partly due to tensions within the coalition and a slim majority in the parliament, the government was unable or unwilling to take more radical measures.

Špidla resigned as prime minister in June 2004 following poor results for his party and coalition partners in the 2004 European Parliament elections and subsequent loss of support within ČSSD, and he left office on 26 July 2004. He was succeeded by Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Stanislav Gross, whose government was sworn in on 4 August. Špidla then accepted the nomination to the European Commission, where he became European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities from 22 November 2004.

Špidla was considered to be on the left wing of ČSSD, though strongly anti-communist. In foreign policy, he was strongly pro-European and expressed support for further integration. His acceptance of the European Commissioner post was criticised as a &quot;golden parachute&quot;, as well as an abandonment of ČSSD and Czech politics.

As a Commissioner, Špidla stated his desire to preserve the European social model, and said that Europe needed to preserve its &quot;core values of social justice, equality, respect for rights and dignity for every individual.&quot; His key policies were to &quot;create more and better jobs,&quot; &quot;reap the benefits of its enlargement,&quot; &quot;address the impact of demographic ageing&quot; and &quot;promote an inclusive society.&quot; He also created a European Globalisation adjustment Fund (EGF) similar to the European Social Fund to help businesses adjust to the effects of globalisation. He stood down in February 2010.

Špidla attempted to return to Czech politics, running for a seat in the Czech senate at the 2010 elections, but was defeated by incumbent Tomáš Jirsa of the Civic Democrats. In 2014, Špidla became Chief Adviser to Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka.

Špidla was nominated by the Prague branch of ČSSD for the 2021 legislative election. However, the party did not reach the 5% threshold and Špidla thus did not become an MP.

Špidla ran in the 2022 Czech Senate election for the Senate seat of Prague 11. He received 8.39% of votes finishing 5th and thus failed to advance to second round.

==Personal life==
Špidla has been married twice; he has two sons from his first marriage and another two children acquired by marriage. His hobbies include cross-country and marathon running. He speaks German and French, but his English is weaker, which was used to question his qualifications for the European Commission.

<text>Dileita Mohamed Dileita (, ; born 12 March 1959) is a Djiboutian politician who was the prime minister of Djibouti from 7 March 2001 to 1 April 2013. He was vice-president of the People&#x27;s Rally for Progress (RPP), the governing political party, until 2012. He also served as president of the Union for the Presidential Majority (UMP), the governing coalition. He was elected President of the National Assembly on 5 March 2023.

==Early years==
Dileita was born in 1959 in the coastal eastern city of Tadjoura, Djibouti, to an Afar family. He studied in Cairo and Reims, then went to the Centre for Vocational Education in Médéa, Algeria, from which he graduated in 1981.

==Political career==
Upon graduation, Dileita returned to Djibouti, where he worked at the Directorate-General of Protocol under the Presidency. He became the second ranking diplomat at the embassy of Djibouti in France in early 1990, and subsequently he became Ambassador to Ethiopia in 1997. He also represented Djibouti at the Organization of African Unity, headquartered in Addis Ababa, while serving as Ambassador to Ethiopia, and assisted in the peace talks that ended the 1998–2000 war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

In December 1999, Dileita was charged with negotiating a peace agreement with a faction of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD); the negotiations led to the signing of an agreement in February 2000. He became ambassador to Uganda in mid-2000. After long-time prime minister Barkat Gourad Hamadou resigned for health reasons in February 2001, President Ismail Omar Guelleh appointed Dileita as prime minister on March 4, 2001, and he took office on March 7. He had no prior experience as a minister.

Dileita was elected as the vice-president of the RPP on July 3, 2003, succeeding Hamadou in that post. Dileita led the ruling coalition, the Union for the Presidential Majority (UMP), in the January 2003 parliamentary election, standing as the first candidate on the coalition&#x27;s list for the District of Djibouti.

On May 21, 2005, Dileita was reappointed as prime minister after Guelleh&#x27;s re-election in the April 2005 presidential election; a new government under Dileita was named on May 22.

As of 2008, Dileita was the president of the UMP coalition, and he headed the UMP list for the District of Djibouti in the February 2008 parliamentary election. Following the election, in which the UMP won all seats amidst an opposition boycott, he resigned as Prime Minister on March 25, 2008. Guelleh promptly reappointed him on March 26 and named a new government under Dileita on March 27.

After Guelleh won a third term in the April 2011 presidential election, he reappointed Dileita as Prime Minister on 11 May 2011. Guelleh retained Dileita in his post even though various other long-serving ministers were dropped from the new government that was announced on 12 May. He was replaced as RPP Vice-president by Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed in September 2012, as part of an extensive shake-up of the RPP leadership.

On 31 March 2013, Dileita was succeeded by Kamil as Prime Minister.

Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union, announced on 11 June 2014 that Dileita was appointed as the African Union&#x27;s Special Envoy for Libya. He was head of the African Union observer mission for the March 2016 Congolese presidential election.

<text>Archant Limited is a newspaper and magazine publishing company with headquarters in Norwich, England. The group publishes four daily newspapers, around 50 weekly newspapers, and 80 consumer and contract magazines. The company is a subsidiary of Newsquest, which is owned by American newspaper publishing company Gannett.

Archant employs around 1,250 employees, mainly in East Anglia, the Home counties and the West Country, and was known as Eastern Counties Newspapers Group until March 2002.

==History==

===1845 to 1900===
The company began publishing in Norwich in 1845 with &quot;Norfolk News&quot;, backed by Jacob Henry Tillet, Jeremiah Colman, John and Johnathan Copeman. The Colman and Copeman families still retain close involvement in the business.

The &quot;Eastern Weekly Press&quot; was launched in 1867 and in 1870 was renamed the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot;. A sister title, the &quot;Eastern Evening News&quot;, was launched in 1882.

===1900 to 2000===
As the business grew it moved premises in 1902, 1959 and again in the late 1960s to its present headquarters location at Prospect House in the centre of Norwich.

At the end of the 1960s, Eastern Counties Newspapers merged with the East Anglian Daily Times Company, publisher of the &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot;, to form Eastern Counties Newspapers Group (ECNG).

ECNG developed further with the launch of Community Media Limited in 1981, a weeklies publishing operation based in Bath, which launched and acquired titles in Scotland and the West Country.

In 1985, ECNG purchased the East Anglia-based &quot;Advertiser&quot; group of weekly free newspapers. These businesses operated as separate entities until the mid-1990s when they were brought together under the ECNG banner.

ECNG acquired four weekly newspapers in Huntingdon, Ely, Wisbech and March from Thomson in 1993. The acquisition of Peterhead-based P Scrogie followed shortly afterwards.

In 1995 the company opened a new 25m Print Center in Thorpe, Norwich, with Goss HT70 Presses and Muller-Martini Mailroom Equipment, Replacing the Goss Metro Presses at Prospect House.

The company moved into Internet publishing in 1996 when it launched Eastern Counties Network, a Web-based service using copy from its four daily newspapers as well as original material. Later this was disaggregated into separate websites for each of the newspapers.

In April 1998, ECNG bought Home Counties Newspapers Holdings plc with an agreed bid of approximately £58 million. The bid earned the company the nickname of &quot;The News Corp. of East Anglia&quot;. HCNH published a range of 26 weekly paid and free titles across Greater London and the Home Counties. The title portfolio included the &quot;Hampstead &amp; Highgate Express&quot;, the &quot;South Essex Recorder&quot; series, the &quot;Herts Advertiser&quot; series, the &quot;Comet&quot; series, the &quot;Herald&quot; group and the &quot;Welwyn &amp; Hatfield Times&quot;.

Consumer magazine publisher Market Link Publishing, now Archant Specialist, based in Essex was acquired by ECNG for £5 million in autumn 1999. Its titles now include &quot;Photography Monthly&quot;, &quot;Professional Photographer&quot;, &quot;Pilot&quot;, &quot;Sport Diver&quot;, &quot;Complete France&quot;, which sponsors a French forum, &quot;French Property News&quot;, &quot;Living France&quot;, and &quot;France Property Shop&quot;. It also sponsors &quot;The France Show&quot; at Olympia and &quot;The French Property Exhibitions&quot; in London and Yorkshire.

===2000 to present===

The launch of a county magazine in Norfolk in 2000 saw the beginning of what is now Archant Life, the country&#x27;s biggest publisher of county magazines. The division was subsequently scaled through multiple acquisitions in the North West, the Cotswolds and the South and South East of England.

In March 2002, ECNG changed its name to Archant, prompted by the company&#x27;s broadening geographic scope and growing range of its activities.

In December 2003, Archant purchased 27 weekly newspapers from Independent News &amp; Media in two separate deals worth up to £62 million. The titles included the &quot;Hackney Gazette&quot;, &quot;Islington Gazette&quot;, the &quot;East London Advertiser&quot;, the &quot;Barking &amp; Dagenham Post&quot;, the &quot;Bexley Times&quot; and the &quot;Bromley Times&quot;.

In April 2007, Archant Scotland&#x27;s eight newspaper titles were sold to Johnston Press for around £11 million.

In February 2008, Archant acquired Compass Magazines and its four monthly regional magazines in Dorset, Hampshire and Surrey.

In September 2009, Archant Print completed an £8 million project to bring its press centre in Norwich up to ten printing towers with associated equipment.

In November 2009, Archant launched Great British Life, a website portal. In the same month, Archant launched Subscription Save, a dedicated magazine subscriptions portal for their publications.

In May 2010, Archant launched &quot;Cambridge First&quot;, a weekly newspaper in Cambridge.

In June 2010, Archant acquired KOS Media Publishing Ltd, the publisher of &quot;Kent on Sunday&quot; and a series of free weekly newspapers, magazines, websites and mobile products, for an undisclosed sum.

In February 2011, Archant London launched an all-new news &amp; information website for London – London24.

In May 2011, Archant Life acquired the &quot;Wye Valley Life&quot; and &quot;Life in The Marches&quot; titles from Wye Valley Media Ltd.

In November 2011, Archant completed a change to its legal structure to simplify the trading companies into one single legal entity, now called Archant Community Media Limited. This does not change the name of the group which remains as Archant Ltd.

In January 2012, Archant launched the unique iwitness24 community news platform that aims to transform the way it gathers news. It is designed to allow readers to contribute pictures and videos in a quick and easy way.

In January 2013, saw a move into local TV with the launch of Mustard TV online in Norwich.

In August 2013, Archant announced the completion of the acquisition of www.planningfinder.com.

In July 2016 Archant announced a new weekly &#x27;pop-up newspaper&#x27;, &quot;The New European&quot;, designed in response to the UK&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union. With a cover price of £2, it was initially intended to run for four editions only;

In August 2017 Mustard TV closed, having been sold to the That&#x27;s TV Group.

In December 2017, Archant won a €676,000.00 grant from Google&#x27;s Digital News Initiative. The project, Local Recall, aims to bring 150 years of newspapers back to life through the latest technology; chatbots. Archant, in partnership with local artificial intelligence leaders ubisend, take on this two-year challenge to make their archived newspapers available via voice and text chatbots. However, as of May 2023, the project website is no longer available and redirects to the EDP24 homepage. No explanation has been given for this, or where the money has gone.

In September 2019 Archant announced its intention to out-source all newspaper printing to Newsprinters (Broxbourne) Ltd. from 10 November 2019, and close the Archant Print Center in Thorpe St. Andrew&#x27;s Norwich, bringing to an end 174 years of newspaper printing in the city. In a letter to staff, Archant said the decision had been taken due to &quot;changes&quot; in the newspaper industry and the move will provide &quot;substantial cost savings&quot;. Approximately 95 Norwich Jobs will be lost as a direct result of this change.

In January 2020 Archant sold its headquarters, Prospect House, to regional insurance firm Alan Boswell Group.

In July 2020, Archant announced it had put itself up for sale and was willing to plug a funding deficit exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s disastrous impact on industry-wide advertising revenues. 

On 30 August it was announced that the operational units of Archant had been sold to private equity firm Rcapital Partners, (and the pension funds transferred to UK Government Pension Protection Fund); the holding companies were put into administration, making the existing shares worthless.

In March 2022, Rcapital sold the group to American media giant Gannett via its British subsidiary Newsquest.

<text>Mari bin Amude Alkatiri ( &quot;&quot;; born 26 November 1949) is a Timorese politician. He was Prime Minister of East Timor from May 2002 until his resignation on 26 June 2006 following weeks of political unrest in the country, and again from September 2017 until May 2018. He is the Secretary-General of the Fretilin party and was the former President of the Special Administrative Region of Oecusse.

Alkatiri is an Hadhrami Arab by ethnicity and comes from the Al-Kathiri tribe, a branch of which ruled the sultanate of Kathiri in the Hadhramaut, which is now part of Yemen. He is one of very few Muslim politicians in a country that is 99.5% Christian. The main issues facing his second term as prime minister were environmental conservation, cultural conservation, accession of East Timor to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, free public education and public health services, and building the country&#x27;s economy, notably the lagging services and manufacturing sectors.

==Life==

Alkatiri&#x27;s ancestors were Hadhrami merchants who lived in Portuguese Timor, he was born in Dili, and had 10 other siblings. He left East Timor in 1970 for post-secondary studies in Portuguese Angola, returning to East Timor as one of the founders of Fretilin, becoming its Minister for Political Affairs. Following Fretilin&#x27;s declaration of independence for the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on 28 November 1975, Alkatiri was sent overseas as part of a high-level diplomatic mission. After Indonesia invaded the nascent nation on 7 December 1975, Alkatiri and his colleagues were unable to return, and he established the headquarters of the Fretilin External Delegation in Maputo, Mozambique.

During the 24-year Indonesian occupation of East Timor, Alkatiri was a chartered surveyor (Angolan School of Geography), and lived in exile in Angola and Mozambique. He also studied law at Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique. Alkatiri was Senior Legal consultant, in a private law office in Maputo from 1992 to 1998, and consultant on Public International Law and Constitutional Law to the Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique from 1995 to 1998.

On 20 May 2002, the United Nations Transitional Administration transferred sovereignty to the first elected Parliament and Government of East Timor. As Secretary-General of the Fretilin Party, which had received a large majority of the vote in Parliamentary elections the previous August, Alkatiri was chosen as the first Prime Minister of the newly independent nation.

In May 2006, his government faced near-civil war conditions when approximately half of the country&#x27;s security forces rebelled amidst scenes of rioting and looting in the country&#x27;s capital, Dili. On 21 June 2006, President Xanana Gusmão called for Alkatiri to resign or else he would, as allegations that Alkatiri had ordered a hit squad to threaten and kill his political opponents led to mass backlash. Senior members of the Fretilin party met on 25 June to discuss Alkatiri&#x27;s future as the prime minister, amidst a protest involving thousands of people calling for Alkatiri to resign instead of Gusmão. The party agreed to keep Alkatiri as prime minister; Foreign and Interim Defence Minister José Ramos-Horta resigned immediately following this decision. On the same day, East Timor&#x27;s chief of police Paulo Martins called for Alkatiri to be arrested for conspiracy to murder his political opponents.

Despite this vote of confidence, Alkatiri resigned on 26 June 2006, to end the uncertainty. In announcing this he said, &quot;I declare I am ready to resign my position as prime minister of the government… so as to avoid the resignation of His Excellency the President of the Republic Xanana Gusmão.&quot;

The &#x27;hit squad&#x27; accusations against Alkatiri were subsequently rejected by a UN Commission, which criticised Gusmão for making inflammatory statements during the crisis, and called Police Chief Paulo Martins&#x27;s abandonment of his post a &#x27;serious dereliction of duty&#x27;.

In the June 2007 parliamentary election, Alkatiri was re-elected to a seat in parliament; he was the second name on Fretilin&#x27;s candidate list, after party president Francisco &quot;Lu Olo&quot; Guterres.

Alkatiri said on 1 August 2007 that he would be Fretilin&#x27;s candidate for prime minister, while criticising the record of his rival for the position, Gusmão, who had left the presidency and was elected to parliament at the head of a new party, the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT). Fretilin won more seats than any other party in parliament, including the CNRT, but a post-electoral coalition led by Gusmão holds a majority of seats. In a statement, Alkatiri called for a national unity government comprising all parties elected to parliament, saying that this would bring stability. With the parties unable to reach an agreement to form a government together, President José Ramos-Horta announced on 6 August that he had decided that the CNRT-led coalition would form the government, with Gusmão at its head. Alkatiri denounced Ramos-Horta&#x27;s decision as unconstitutional, and angry Fretilin supporters reacted to Ramos-Horta&#x27;s announcement with violent protests, although Alkatiri said that the party would fight the decision through legal means and would encourage people to protest and practice civil disobedience. The party subsequently backed away from its threat of legal action.

Later in August, after Australian soldiers took Fretilin flags during protests and allegedly desecrated them, Alkatiri accused the Australians of working against Fretilin and intimidating it, and said that &quot;it would be better for Australian troops to just return home if they cannot be neutral&quot;.

In September 2017, Alkatiri was voted again to be Timor Leste&#x27;s prime minister. In the 2018 parliamentary elections, Alkatiri, who gave up his parliamentary seat and was replaced by Noémia Sequeira. 

==Assessment==
Alkatiri has been described as a skillful negotiator and an economic nationalist who secured as larger portion of East Timor&#x27;s share of the Timor Sea oil resources against Australia. He was backed by Portugal but opposed by the Australian government of John Howard.

Alkatiri is an Honorary Member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation&#x27;s Roncalli Committee.

<text>Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych (born 9 July 1950) is a Ukrainian (until 2014) and Russian politician who served as the fourth president of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014. He also served as the prime minister of Ukraine several times between 2002 and 2007 and was a member of the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) from 2006 to 2010. Yanukovych was removed from the presidency in the 2014 Revolution of Dignity, which followed months of protests against him. Since then, he has lived in exile in Russia.

Yanukovych was a member of the pro-Russian Party of Regions. Before entering national politics, Yanukovych was the Governor of his native Donetsk Oblast from 1997 to 2002. He was simultaneously the Chairman of the oblast&#x27;s legislature from 1999 to 2001.

He first ran for president in the 2004 election, where he was declared the winner against Viktor Yushchenko. However, allegations of electoral fraud and voter intimidation caused widespread protests, in what became known as the Orange Revolution. The Ukrainian Supreme Court nullified the election and ordered a rerun, which Yanukovych lost to Yushchenko. Yanukovych ran for president again in 2010, this time beating Yulia Tymoshenko in an election deemed free and fair by international observers.

Yanukovych stood for economic modernisation, greater economic ties with the EU, and military non-alignment. However, his years in power saw what analysts described as democratic backsliding, which included the jailing of Tymoshenko, a decline in press freedom and an increase in cronyism and corruption. 

In November 2013, Yanukovych suddenly withdrew from signing an association agreement with the EU, amidst economic pressure from Russia. Ukraine&#x27;s parliament had overwhelmingly approved finalizing the agreement. This sparked massive protests against him, known as the Euromaidan. The unrest peaked in February 2014, when almost 100 protesters were killed by government forces.

An agreement was then signed by Yanukovych and the opposition, but he secretly fled the capital that evening. The next day, 22 February 2014, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament voted to remove him and schedule early elections on the grounds that he had withdrawn from his constitutional duties. Some of his own party voted for his removal. 

Ukraine&#x27;s new government issued an arrest warrant for Yanukovych, accusing him of responsibility for the killing of protesters. He fled to Russia, claiming to still be the head of state. In 2019, he was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to a thirteen-year prison term for high treason by a Ukrainian court. In polling conducted since he left office, Yanukovych has ranked as one of the worst presidents in Ukrainian history. Yanukovych has also given his name to a collective term for blunders made by Ukrainian politicians: &quot;Yanukisms&quot;.

==Early life and early career==
Viktor Yanukovych was born in the village of Zhukovka near Yenakiieve in Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. Of his childhood he has written: &quot;My childhood was difficult and hungry. I grew up without my mother, who died when I was two. I went around bare-footed on the streets. I had to fight for myself every day.

Yanukovych is of Russian, Polish and Belarusian descent. Yanukovych is a surname of Belarusian origin, &quot;Yanuk&quot; being a derivative of the Catholic name &quot;Yan&quot; (&quot;John&quot;). His mother was a Russian nurse and his father, Fyodor Yanukovych, was a Polish-Belarusian locomotive-driver, originally from in the Dokshytsy Raion of the Vitebsk Region which is in present-day Belarus. On various occasions, Yanukovych&#x27;s family has been dogged by accusations that Fyodor Yanukovych was a member of the &quot;Schutzmannschaft&quot; during World War II, in particular claims by members of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, which included documents from the NKVD supposedly revealing his involvement with the &quot;Schutzmannschaft&quot;. However, it has also been stated by residents of Yanuki that Yanukovych&#x27;s family left for the Donbas before 1917, and that the collaborator Fyodor Yanukovych was an unrelated individual. Others, particularly members of the Party of Regions, have claimed that the documents were a falsehood with the intention of disparaging Yanukovych ahead of elections.

By the time he was a teenager, Yanukovych&#x27;s father had remarried. However, Viktor left home due to conflicts with his stepmother, and was brought up by his Polish paternal grandmother, originally from Warsaw. His grandfather and great-grandparents were Lithuanian-Poles. Yanukovych has half-sisters from his father&#x27;s remarriage, but has no contact with them.

On 15 December 1967, at the age of 17, Yanukovych was sentenced to three years imprisonment for participating in a robbery and assault. On 8 June 1970 he was convicted for a second time on charges of assault. He was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and did not appeal the verdict. Decades later, Yanukovych characterised his arrests and imprisonment as &quot;mistakes of youth&quot;.

In 1971, Yanukovych married Lyudmyla Nastenko a niece of Yenakiyeve city judge Oleksandr Sazhyn.

In July 1974, Yanukovych enrolled at the Donetsk Polytechnic Institute. In 1976, as a second-year student, he was promoted to director of a trucking division within the &quot;Ordzhonikidzeugol&quot; coal-mining company. His appointment as the chief manager marked the start of his managerial career as a regional transport executive. He held various positions in transport companies in Yenakiieve and Donetsk until 1996.

==Political career: 1996–2010==
Yanukovych&#x27;s political career began when he was appointed as a Vice-Head of Donetsk Oblast Administration in August 1996. On 14 May 1997, he was appointed as the Head of the Administration (i.e. Governor).

===Prime Minister (2002–2004)===
President Leonid Kuchma appointed Yanukovych to the post of prime minister following Anatoliy Kinakh&#x27;s resignation. Yanukovych began his term as prime minister on 21 November 2002 following a 234-vote confirmation in the Ukrainian parliament, eight more than needed.

In foreign affairs, Yanukovych&#x27;s cabinet was considered to be politically close to Russia, although declaring support for Ukrainian membership in the European Union. Although Yanukovych&#x27;s parliamentary coalition was not supporting Ukrainian membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), his cabinet agreed to the commission of Ukrainian troops to the Iraq War in support of the United States&#x27; War on Terrorism.

===2004 presidential campaign===

In 2004, as the prime minister, Yanukovych participated in the controversial Ukrainian presidential election as the Party of Regions candidate. Yanukovych&#x27;s main base of support emerged from the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine, which favor close ties with neighbouring Russia. In the first round of voting held on 31 October 2004, Yanukovych took second place with 39.3 percent of the votes to opposition leader Viktor Yuschenko with 39.8 percent. Because no candidate passed the 50 percent threshold, a second round of voting was scheduled.

In the second round of the election, Yanukovych was initially declared the winner. However, the legitimacy of the election was questioned by Ukrainians, international organizations, and foreign governments following allegations of electoral fraud. The resulting widespread protests became known as the Orange Revolution. The second round of the election was subsequently annulled by the Supreme Court of Ukraine, and in the repeated run-off, Yanukovych lost to Yushchenko with 44.2 percent to Yushchenko&#x27;s 51.9 percent.

After the election, the Ukrainian parliament passed a non-binding motion of no confidence in Yanukovych&#x27;s government, urging outgoing President Kuchma to dismiss Yanukovych and appoint a caretaker government. Five days after his electoral defeat, Yanukovych declared his resignation from the post of prime minister. In November 2009 Yanukovych stated that he conceded defeat only to avoid violence. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want mothers to lose their children and wives their husbands. I didn&#x27;t want dead bodies from Kyiv to flow down the Dnipro. I didn&#x27;t want to assume power through bloodshed.&quot;

===After the Orange Revolution===
Following his electoral defeat in 2004, Yanukovych led the main opposition party against the Tymoshenko government made up of Yushchenko&#x27;s Our Ukraine, the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, and Oleksandr Moroz&#x27;s Socialist Party. This government was marred by growing conflict between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko. Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions support allowed for the establishment of Yuriy Yekhanurov&#x27;s government in late 2005. 

In October 2004, Ukrainian deputy Hryhory Omelchenko accused Yanukovych of having been a member of &quot;a group of individuals who brutally beat and raped a woman, but bought off the victim and the criminal case was closed&quot;. The press-service of the Ukrainian Cabinet asserted that Yanukovych suffered for the attempt to defend a girl from hooligans.

In 2005, the Party of Regions signed a collaboration agreement with the Russian political party United Russia. In 2008, Yanukovych spoke at a congress of the United Russia party.

===2006–2007 elections and second premiership===
In January 2006, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine started an official investigation of the allegedly false acquittal of the criminal convictions which Yanukovych received in his youth. Yuriy Lutsenko, the head of the ministry, announced that forensic tests proved the forgery of the respective documents (issued in instead of 1978) and initially claimed that lack of the formal acquittal precluded Yanukovych from running for the seat in the 2006 parliamentary election.

However, the latter statement was corrected within days by Lutsenko, who conceded that the outcome of the investigation into the legality of the Yanukovych&#x27;s acquittal could not affect his eligibility to run for the parliament seat since the deprivation of his civil rights due to the past convictions would have expired anyway due to the statute of limitations. Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions won the 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election.

In 2006, a criminal charge was made for the falsification of documents regarding the retraction of Yanukovych&#x27;s prior conviction. According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta two documents had been forged regarding Yanukovych&#x27;s robbery in association with rape and assault and battery. The signature of the judge for these documents in Yanukovych&#x27;s retraction was also forged.

On 25 May 2007, Yanukovych was assigned the post of appointed chairman of the Government Chiefs Council of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

==Presidential campaign and election==


In 2009, Yanukovych announced his intent to run for president in the then upcoming presidential election. He was endorsed by the Party of Regions and the Youth Party of Ukraine.

Minister of Internal Affairs Yuriy Lutsenko accused Yanukovych of financial fraud during the campaign. Yanukovych&#x27;s campaign was expected to have cost $100 to $150 million.

On 11 December 2009, Yanukovych called for his supporters to go to Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Kyiv&#x27;s Independence Square, in case of election fraud.

Early vote returns from the first round of the election held on 17 January showed Yanukovych in first place with 35.8% of the vote. He faced a 7 February 2010 runoff against Tymoshenko, who finished second (with 24.7% of the vote). After all ballots were counted, the Ukrainian Central Election Commission declared that Yanukovych won the runoff election with 48.95% of the vote compared with 45.47% for Tymoshenko. Election observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said there were no indications of serious fraud and described the vote as an &quot;impressive display&quot; of democracy. Tymoshenko withdrew her subsequent legal challenge of the result. Tad Devine, an associate of Rick Gates and Paul Manafort, wrote Yanukovych&#x27;s victory speech.

==Presidency (2010–2014)==

===Inauguration===
Ukraine&#x27;s parliament had (on 16 February) fixed 25 February 2010 for the inauguration of Yanukovych as president. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko signed a decree endorsing a plan of events related to Yanukovych&#x27;s inauguration on 20 February 2010. Yushchenko also congratulated and wished Yanukovych &quot;to defend Ukrainian interests and democratic traditions&quot; at the presidential post.

Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Rus at Yanukovych&#x27;s invitation conducted a public prayer service at Kyiv Pechersk Lavra before Yanukovych&#x27;s presidential inauguration. Kirill also attended the inauguration along with High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton, United States National Security Advisor James Jones and speaker of the Russian parliament Boris Gryzlov.

Yanukovych&#x27;s immediate predecessor, Yushchenko, did not attend the ceremony, nor did the Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, and her party, Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko.

===First days===
On 3 March 2010, Yanukovych suspended his membership in the Party of Regions as he was barred by the Constitution from heading a political party while president, and handed over leadership in the party and its parliamentary faction to Mykola Azarov.
On new alliances
Yanukovych said, &quot;Ukraine&#x27;s integration with the EU remains our strategic aim&quot;, with a &quot;balanced policy, which will protect our national interests both on our eastern border – I mean with Russia – and of course with the European Union&quot;. According to Yanukovych, Ukraine must be a &quot;neutral state&quot; which should be part of a &quot;collective defence system which the European Union, NATO and Russia will take part in.&quot; Yanukovych wants Ukraine to &quot;neither join NATO nor the CSTO&quot;. He stated on 7 January 2010 that Ukraine is ready to consider an initiative by Dmitry Medvedev on the creation of a new Europe collective security system stating &quot;And we&#x27;re ready to back Russia&#x27;s and France&#x27;s initiatives&quot;.

Yanukovych stated during the 2010 presidential election-campaign that the current level of Ukraine&#x27;s cooperation with NATO was sufficient and that the question of the country&#x27;s accession to the alliance was therefore not urgent. &quot;The Ukrainian people don&#x27;t currently support Ukraine&#x27;s entry to NATO and this corresponds to the status that we currently have. We don&#x27;t want to join any military bloc&quot;. On 27 May 2010 Yanukovych stated he considered Ukraine&#x27;s relations with NATO as a partnership, &quot;And Ukraine can&#x27;t live without this [partnership], because Ukraine is a large country&quot;.

In early November 2011, Yanukovych claimed that &quot;arms are being bought in the country and armed attacks on government agencies are being prepared.&quot; These claims were met with disbelief.

2012 presidential predictions
For 2012 Yanukovych predicted &quot;social standards will continue to grow&quot; and &quot;improvement of administrative services system will continue&quot;. Yanukovich announced $2 billion worth of pension and other welfare increases on 7 March 2012.

Constitutional assembly
In May 2012, Yanukovych set up the Constitutional Assembly of Ukraine, a special auxiliary agency under the President for drawing up bills of amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine; the President then can table them in parliament.

===Domestic policy===
Amid controversy Ukrainian lawmakers formed a new coalition on 11 March 2010 which included Bloc Lytvyn, Communist Party of Ukraine and Party of Regions that led to the Azarov Government. 235 deputies from the 450-member parliament signed the coalition agreement.

====Presidential powers====
On 25 June 2010, Yanukovych criticised 2004 amendments in the Ukrainian Constitution which weakened presidential powers such as control over naming government ministers, passing those functions to parliament.

During the 2011 World Economic Forum, Yanukovych called Ukraine &quot;one of the leaders on democratic development in Eastern Europe&quot;.

====Financial policy====

=====Tax code=====
On 30 November 2010, Yanukovych vetoed a new tax code made by the Azarov Government and earlier approved by the Verkhovna Rada but protested against in rallies across Ukraine (one of the largest protests since the 2004 Orange Revolution). Yanukovych signed a new tax code on 3 December 2010.

=====Domestic spending vs. debt=====
Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions wanted to increase social benefits, and raise salaries and pensions. In late 2009, a law that raised the minimum wage and pensions was passed in the Ukrainian Parliament. As a result of this, the International Monetary Fund suspended its 2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis emergency lending programme. According to the IMF, the law breached promises to control spending. During the 2010 presidential campaign, Yanukovych had stated he would stand by this law.

According to Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc member of parliament Oleh Shevchuk, Yanukovych broke this election promise just three days after the 2010 presidential election when only two lawmakers of Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions supported a bill to raise pensions for low-incomes.

====Energy policy====

=====Russian gas=====
According to Yanukovych, relations between Ukraine and Russia in the gas sector were to be built &quot;according to the rules of the market&quot;. He saw the gas agreement signed in 2009 after the 2009 Russia-Ukraine gas dispute as very unprofitable for Ukraine and wanted to &quot;initiate the discussion of the most urgent gas issues&quot; after the 2010 presidential election. Yanukovych had promised before his election as Ukrainian President to &quot;solve the issue&quot; concerning the Russian Black Sea Fleet, currently stationed in the Ukrainian port Sevastopol, &quot;in a way so that the interests of Russia or Ukraine would not be harmed&quot;.

This led to the April 2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty. Yanukovych also promised to create a consortium that would allow Russia to jointly operate Ukraine&#x27;s gas transportation network and he has pledged to help Russia build the South Stream natural gas pipeline. As of June 2010, both did not happen.

Yanukovych rejected accusations that improvement of Ukrainian-Russian relations harmed relations with the European Union. &quot;Our policy is directed to protection of our national interests. We do not live in a fairy tale and understand that our partners also defend their interests&quot;. In February 2012, Yanukovych stated, referring to relations with Russia, &quot;It is not wise to fall asleep next to a big bear&quot;.

=====Downgrading uranium stock=====

During the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit, Yanukovych announced that Ukraine would give up its 90-kilogram stock of highly enriched uranium and convert its research reactors from highly enriched to low-enriched uranium. It intended to accomplish these goals by 2012.

====Cultural policy====

=====East/West Ukraine unification=====
Yanukovych stated that his &quot;aim and dream&quot; was to unify Ukraine, although in his opinion &quot;there are already no borders between the East and West of the country today&quot;. Yanukovych said he wanted to create a free trade zone and visa regime with the EU as soon as possible. He noted the importance of finding ways of reconciliation between Ukrainians fighting on opposite sides in World War II in his speech at the ceremony to mark Victory Day 2013. In this speech he also expressed confidence that Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism of the past would never return.

=====Holodomor=====

The Soviet famine of 1932–33, called &quot;Holodomor&quot; in Ukrainian, claimed up to 10 million lives, mostly in Ukraine but also in some other parts of the Soviet Union, as peasants&#x27; food stocks were forcibly removed by Stalin&#x27;s regime via the NKVD secret police.

Yanukovych&#x27;s stance on the Holodomor was: &quot;Holodomor took place, was denounced and the international society gave an evaluation of the famine, but it was never labeled as a genocide of the Ukrainian people. Ukraine&#x27;s attempts to do so by blaming one of our neighbors are unjust.&quot; &quot;The Holodomor was in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. It was the result of the policies of Stalin&#x27;s totalitarian regime.&quot; In 2003, he supported then President Kuchma&#x27;s position that the Holodomor famine was genocide against Ukrainians.

Yanukovych&#x27;s press service claims that he does not approve of crimes of the KGB and their predecessors in Soviet times, however, in 2002, he wrote a foreword to a book by two ex-KGB agents endorsing the KGB and its predecessors, stating that the NKVD and Cheka &quot;firmly stood on guard over the interests of our people and the state&quot; and praised them for launching &quot;a struggle against political extremism, sabotage and criminal activities.&quot; He also wrote that &quot;Donbas Chekists under any conditions have done and do their high duty with honor&quot;.

=====Russian as an official language=====

Yanukovych stated in the past that he wanted Russian to become the second state language in Ukraine. Currently Ukrainian is the only official language of Ukraine. On the other hand, he stated at a meeting with Taras Shevchenko National Prize winners in Kyiv on 9 March 2010 that &quot;Ukraine will continue to promote the Ukrainian language as its only state language&quot;.

In a newspaper interview during the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election campaign, he stated that the status of Russian in Ukraine &quot;is too politicized&quot; and said that if elected president in 2010 he would &quot;have a real opportunity to adopt a law on languages, which implements the requirements of the European Charter of regional languages&quot;. He said that this law would need 226 votes in the Ukrainian parliament (half of the votes instead of two-thirds of the votes needed to change the constitution of Ukraine) and that voters told him that the current status of Russian in Ukraine created &quot;problems in the hospital, school, university, in the courts, in the office&quot;.

Effective in August 2012, a new law on regional languages entitles any local language spoken by at least a 10% minority be declared official within that area. On 23 February 2014, following the Revolution of Dignity, a bill was passed by the parliament which would have abolished the law on regional languages, making Ukrainian the sole state language at all levels. This bill was blocked by acting president Turchynov, until a replacement bill is ready. The 2012 law was ruled unconstitutional and was struck down by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine in 2018, 4 years after the Euromaidan.

=====Religion=====
In a late July 2013 speech Yanukovych stated: &quot;All churches and religious organizations are equal for the state. We respect the choice of our citizens and guarantee everyone&#x27;s Constitutional right to freedom of religion. We will not allow the use of churches and religious organizations by some political forces for their narrow interests. This also refers to foreign centres through which religious organizations sometimes seek to affect the internal political situation in Ukraine. This is a matter of the state&#x27;s national security&quot;.

====Social policy====
Social benefit cuts for Chernobyl rescue workers, small business owners and veterans of the Soviet–Afghan War caused fierce protests in Kyiv in October/November 2011 by several thousand protesters.

===Foreign policy===


Yanukovych&#x27;s first foreign visit was to Brussels to visit the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, and the EU Foreign Affairs chief, Catherine Ashton. During the visit Yanukovych stated that there would be no change to Ukraine&#x27;s status as a member of the NATO outreach program.

During his second foreign visit to Moscow in March, Yanukovych vowed to end years of acrimony with Russia, saying that ties between Russia and Ukraine &quot;should never be the way they were for the past five years&quot;. He indicated that he was open to compromise with Russia on the Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s future (this led to the April 2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty), and reiterated that Ukraine would remain a &quot;European, non-aligned state&quot;, referring to NATO membership. Russian President Medvedev (April 2010) and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin (June 2010) soon stated they noticed a big improvement in relations with Ukraine since Yanukovych&#x27;s presidency.

On 3 June 2010, the Ukrainian parliament excluded, in a bill written by Yanukovych, with 226 votes, Ukrainian membership of any military bloc, but allowed for co-operation with military alliances such as NATO. A day later Yanukovych stated that the recognition of the independence of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Kosovo violates international law, &quot;I have never recognized Abkhazia, South Ossetia or Kosovo&#x27;s independence. This is a violation of international law&quot;.

On 22 November 2010, the European Council and Ukraine announced &quot;an action plan for Ukraine toward the establishment of a visa-free regime for short-stay travel&quot;. In May 2011, Yanukovych stated that he would strive for Ukraine to join the EU. Yanukovych&#x27;s stance towards integration with the EU, according to &quot;The Economist&quot;, led him to be &quot;seen in Moscow as a traitor&quot;, a reversal of the 2004 presidential election where Moscow openly supported Yanukovych.

===Crimean naval base===

On 21 April 2010, in Kharkiv, Yanukovych and Medvedev signed the 2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty, whereby the Russian lease on naval facilities in Crimea would be extended beyond 2017 by 25 years with an additional 5-year renewal option (to 2042–47) in exchange for a multi-year discounted contract to provide Ukraine with Russian natural gas. This treaty was approved by both the Russian and Ukrainian parliaments (Verkhovna Rada) on 27 April 2010.

On 22 April 2010, Yanukovych stated he did not rule out the possibility of holding a referendum on the stationing of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Ukraine after the necessary legislative framework is adopted for this in future. Yanukovych did plan to hold plebiscites also on other subjects. Opposition members accused Yanukovych of &quot;selling out national interests&quot;.

According to Yanukovych the main priority of his foreign policy was to integrate Ukraine &quot;into the European mainstream&quot;, while improving relations with Russia. According to Yanukovych the only way to lower the state budget deficit, as requested by the International Monetary Fund, while protecting pensioners and minimal wages was to extend the Russian Navy lease in Crimea in exchange for cheaper natural gas.

===2012 parliamentary elections===
In 2012, during the Ukrainian parliamentary elections of that year, Yanukovych&#x27;s party of Regions won the poll with 30% against 25.5% for imprisoned Yulia Tymoshenko&#x27;s Fatherland party.

===Criticism of his presidency===
====Alleged attempt to remove opposition====
Yanukovych and the Party of Regions were accused of trying to create a &quot;controlled democracy&quot; in Ukraine and as a means to this were trying to &quot;destroy&quot; main opposition party BYuT, but both denied these charges. One frequently cited example of Yanukovych&#x27;s attempts to centralize power is the 2011 sentencing of Yulia Tymoshenko, which was condemned by Western governments as potentially being politically motivated. Other high-profile political opponents under criminal investigation include Kuchma, Bogdan Danilishin, Igor Didenko, Anatoliy Makarenko, and Valeriy Ivaschenko.

According to Yanukovych (on 4 February 2011), &quot;[M]any lies [have been] told and attempts made to misinform the international community and ordinary people in Ukraine about the true state of affairs in the country.&quot; He also stated, &quot;[A] crushing blow delivered under [my] rule to corruption and bureaucracy has been met with resistance&quot;. He stated in February 2012 that the trial of Tymoshenko and other former officials &quot;didn&#x27;t meet European standards and principles&quot;.

====Press censorship allegation====
As president, Yanukovych stated in early February 2010 that he would support the freedom of speech of journalists and protect their interests. During spring 2010 Ukrainian journalists and Reporters Without Borders complained of censorship by Yanukovych&#x27;s Presidential Administration; despite statements by Yanukovych how deeply he valued press freedom and that &#x27;free, independent media that must ensure society&#x27;s unimpeded access to information.&#x27;

Anonymous journalists stated early May 2010 that they were voluntarily tailoring their coverage so as not to offend the Yanukovych administration and the Azarov Government. The Azarov Government, the Presidential Administration and Yanukovych himself denied being involved with censorship. In a press conference 12 May 2010 President Yanukovych&#x27;s representative in the Parliament Yury Miroshnychenko stated that Yanukovych was against political repression for criticism of the regime.

====Reports of corruption and cronyism====
Yanukovych has been criticized for &quot;massive&quot; corruption and cronyism.

By January 2013, more than half of the ministers appointed by Yanukovych were either born in the Donbas region or made some crucial part of their careers there, and Yanukovych has been accused of &quot;regional cronyism&quot; for his staffing of police, judiciary, and tax services &quot;all over Ukraine&quot; with &quot;Donbas people&quot;. Over 46% of the budget subventions for social and economic development was allotted to the Donbas region&#x27;s Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast administrations – ₴0.62 billion ($76.2 million) versus ₴0.71 billion ($87.5 million) for the rest of the country.

Anders Åslund, a Swedish economist and Ukraine analyst, described the consolidation of Ukrainian economic power in the hands of a few &quot;elite industrial tycoons&quot;, including Yanukovych&#x27;s son Oleksandr. The exact distribution of wealth and precise weight of influence are difficult to gauge, but most of the country&#x27;s richest men were afraid to cross the Yanukovich family, even in cases where their own economic interests favored an economically pro-EU Ukraine.

The Yanukovych family, a group of young businessmen described as &quot;robber capitalists&quot;, have been buying up both public and private businesses at &quot;rock bottom&quot; prices available in the stagnating economic conditions brought on by Yanukovych&#x27;s economic policies.&quot; According to Åslund, one notable exception to the Yanukovych family&#x27;s influence was Petro Poroshenko, who is described as &quot;uncommonly courageous&quot;, although his confectionery empire is less susceptible to ruin by the substantial power the Yanukovych family wielded in the heavy industry sectors located in Yanukovych&#x27;s geographic power base of Donetsk.

Yanukovych had an estimated net worth of $12 billion, and has been accused by Ukrainian officials of misappropriating funds from Ukraine&#x27;s treasury. Arseniy Yatsenyuk has claimed that treasury funds of up to $70 billion were transferred to foreign accounts during Yanukovych&#x27;s presidency.
 Authorities in Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein froze the assets of Yanukovych and his son Oleksander on 28 February 2014 pending a money laundering investigation. Yanukovych has denied that he embezzled funds and has said that his alleged foreign accounts do not exist.

During the presidency of Yanukovych, at least 7,000 Ukrainian companies were attacked by the oligarchic clan of Yanukovych (the so-called &quot;Yanukovych Families&quot;). This number includes both cases of the so-called Family entering the corporate rights of the firms they like by illegal methods, and &quot;assaults&quot; in order to obtain &quot;tribute&quot; – that is, commercial gain. This is evidenced by the data of the Anti-Raider Union of Entrepreneurs of Ukraine. The victims of Yanukovych&#x27;s raider methods were offered to pay a regular &quot;tribute&quot; in the amount of 30–50% of the company&#x27;s profits – or to cede ownership of it.

====Personal excesses====
Yanukovych abandoned his estate Mezhyhirya when he fled the capital. The estate is located in a former forest preserve on the outskirts of Kyiv.

He had acquired the property in 2007, according to critics, through a convoluted series of companies and transactions. Yanukovych did not reveal the price he paid, although he called it a &quot;very serious price&quot;. Mezhyhirya is estimated to have been sold for more than 75 million U.S. dollars.

In a feature with photos on Yanukovych&#x27;s Mezhyhirya mansion, Sergii Leshchenko notes &quot;For most of [Yanukovych&#x27;s] career he was a public servant or parliament deputy, where his salary never exceeded 2000 US dollars per month.&quot; Under a photo showing the new home&#x27;s ornate ceiling, Leschenko remarks, &quot;In a country where 35% of the population live under poverty line, spending 100,000 dollars on each individual chandelier seems excessive, to say the least.&quot; Crowned with a pure copper roof, the mansion was the largest wooden structure ever created by Finnish log home builder Honka, whose representative suggested to Yanukovych that it be nominated for the Guinness Book of Records.

The property contained a private zoo, underground shooting range, 18-hole golf course, tennis, and bowling. After describing the mansion&#x27;s complicated ownership scheme, the article author noted, &quot;The story of Viktor Yanukovych and his residence highlights a paradox. Having completely rejected such European values as human rights and democracy, the Ukrainian president uses Europe as a place to hide his dirty money with impunity.&quot;

Documents recovered from Yanukovych&#x27;s compound show among other expenses $800 medical treatment for fish, $14,500 spent on tablecloths, and a nearly 42 million dollar order for light fixtures. Also recovered were files on Yanukovych&#x27;s perceived enemies, especially media members, including beating victim Tetyana Chornovol. The cost of monitoring the mass media was reportedly $5.7 million just for the month of December 2010.

When the former president departed, 35 cars and seven motorbikes were left behind. Kyiv&#x27;s District Court seized 27 vintage cars in 2016 from the fleet stationed at Mezhyhirya, some worth more than $US 1 million.

Yanukovych told &quot;BBC Newsnight&quot; (in June 2015) that stories that Mezhyhirya cost the Ukrainian taxpayer millions of dollars were &quot;political technology and spin&quot; and that the estate did not belong to him personally; he claimed that the ostriches in the residence&#x27;s petting zoo &quot;just happened to be there&quot; and remarked &quot;I supported the ostriches, what&#x27;s wrong with that?&quot;.

====Vote rigging allegations====
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe confirmed witness accounts of voters being blocked from access to polls and being attacked along with local election officials who tried to frustrate the Berkut&#x27;s practice of falsifying voters&#x27; ballots in favor of Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions candidates. Individual cases have been reported of citizens grouping together and fighting back against the Berkut in order to preserve election integrity and results. Upon coming to power Yanukovych had reversed oversight measures established during the Yushchenko administration to restrain the Berkut&#x27;s abuse of citizens whereupon the special force &quot;upped its brutality.&quot;

==Euromaidan protests==

Since 2012, Ukraine and the EU had been negotiating a free trade and association agreement. In 2013, the Ukrainian Parliament overwhelmingly approved finalizing the agreement with the EU, and Yanukovych urged parliament to adopt laws so that Ukraine would meet the EU&#x27;s criteria and be able to sign the agreement in November 2013.

Russia, however, put pressure on Ukraine to reject the EU Association Agreement. In August 2013, Russia began restricting Ukrainian imports, which Ukraine&#x27;s opposition parties described as &quot;a trade war&quot; to pressure the country not to sign the agreement. The agreement was to be finalized at a summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. On 21 November, a week before the summit, Yanukovych suddenly announced he was pulling out of the agreement, and instead strengthening economic ties with Russia. Jovita Neliupšienė, foreign policy aide to Lithuania&#x27;s president Dalia Grybauskaitė, said Yanukovych had called her to say he had changed his mind due to what she called Russian &quot;economic pressure and blackmail&quot;. The Lithuanian president&#x27;s office said Russia had threatened Ukraine with huge trade losses and job losses if it signed the EU agreement. Russia also offered more favorable trade terms than those offered by the EU and IMF.

This sparked protests at Independence Square (&quot;Maidan Nezalezhnosti&quot;) in the center of Kyiv, which became known as &#x27;Euromaidan&#x27;. The protesters, united under the Maidan People&#x27;s Union, demanded Yanukovych fulfill his pledge to sign the Agreement or else resign. They also called for a return to the 2004 Constitution of Ukraine to give more power to parliament over the president. The scope of the protests soon widened. Protesters opposed what they saw as widespread government corruption, abuse of power, human rights violations, and the influence of oligarchs.

During the &#x27;Maidan uprising&#x27;, Independence Square was a huge protest camp occupied by thousands of protesters and protected by makeshift barricades. It had kitchens, first aid posts and broadcasting facilities, as well as stages for speeches, lectures, debates and performances. Police assaulted the camp several times, causing further anger.

Yanukovych has been accused, by Amnesty International among others, of using the Berkut to threaten, attack, and torture protesters. The Berkut, later disbanded on 25 February 2014, were a special police force under his personal command and were accused of defending Russian interests.

Violence escalated after 16 January 2014, when Yanukovych signed draconian Anti-Protest Laws. The first protesters were killed in fierce clashes with police on Hrushevsky Street on 19–22 January. In response, demonstrators occupied provincial government buildings in many regions of Ukraine. On 28 January, parliament repealed nine of the 12 restrictive laws. That day, Mykola Azarov, the prime minister of Ukraine, resigned &quot;for the sake of a peaceful resolution&quot; to the civil unrest.

The deadliest clashes were on 18–20 February, which saw the most severe violence in Ukraine since it regained independence. Thousands of protesters advanced from the Maidan in Kyiv towards parliament, led by activists with shields and helmets. They were fired on by police snipers. Almost 100 protesters were killed, as were 13 police officers.

In June 2015 interview with &quot;BBC Newsnight&quot; Yanukovych stated that he never ordered the security forces to open fire, but he also said he had not done enough to prevent bloodshed. He said &quot;the members of the security forces fulfilled their duties according to existing laws. They had the right to use weapons.&quot;

==Removal from presidency==

On Friday 21 February 2014, Yanukovych and the leaders of the parliamentary opposition signed an agreement to bring about an interim unity government including the opposition, reinstatement of the constitution of 2004 and early elections before December at the latest. That day, the Ukrainian parliament voted 386–0 to reinstate the 2004 Constitution of Ukraine. During the afternoon, police abandoned central Kyiv, allowing protesters to take control. Yanukovych secretly fled the city that evening without signing the measure that would reinstate the 2004 constitution he agreed to ratify in the EU-brokered agreement.

On Saturday 22 February, Yanukovych could not be found, and parliament was not informed of his whereabouts. Parliament held an emergency session. The Chairman of parliament, Volodymyr Rybak, resigned that morning. Parliament then elected Oleksandr Turchynov as chairman. Under the 2004 Constitution, which since the day before was again in force, the President&#x27;s powers would transfer to the chairman in case the President should resign or be unable to fulfill his duties. The later constitution had stated the President&#x27;s powers would transfer to the Prime Minister. The acting prime minister, Serhiy Arbuzov, was also missing.

In the afternoon, the Rada voted 328–0 (about 73% of its 447 members) to remove Yanukovych from his post and to schedule an early presidential election for 25 May. The resolution stated that Yanukovych had withdrawn from fulfilling his constitutional duties, &quot;which threatens the governance of the state, the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine&quot;, and cited &quot;circumstances of extreme urgency&quot;. The resolution to remove Yanukovych was supported by all opposition parties: 86 deputies of Batkivshchyna (Fatherland Party), 41 deputies of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (UDAR), 36 deputies of Svoboda (Freedom Party), 30 deputies of the Communist Party, as well as 99 independents. Furthermore, 36 deputies of Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions voted for his removal. There were no votes against. Of the remaining deputies, 115 were absent and 6 did not vote. Under the 2004 constitution, parliament chairman Turchynov became acting president.

The vote came an hour after Yanukovych said in a televised address that he would not resign. He subsequently declared himself to still be &quot;the legitimate head of the Ukrainian state elected in a free vote by Ukrainian citizens&quot;, and maintained that his removal was a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

Political scientist Maria Popova says that &quot;the solution that took place within the Rada was more legitimate than any strictly legal solution that could have come from the Constitutional Court&quot;. Parliament did not vote to impeach the President, which would have involved formally charging Yanukovych with a crime, a review of the charge by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and a three-fourths majority vote in parliament—at least 338 votes in favor. The Ukrainian Constitution at this time (like many other constitutions) did not provide any stipulation about how to remove a president who is neither dead nor incapacitated, but is nonetheless absent or not fulfilling his duties. The lack of such provisions was a lacuna. Viktor Yanukovych fled from Ukraine to Russia. The title of the resolution was &quot;«Resolution of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. On self-removal of the President of Ukraine from the exercise of constitutional powers and appointment of extraordinary elections of the President of Ukraine»&quot;.

On the same day that parliament removed Yanukovych from office, it voted to authorize the release of his rival Yulia Tymoshenko from a prison hospital. She had been imprisoned since 2011, in what many saw as political payback by Yanukovych. Her release had been an unmet condition for Ukraine&#x27;s signing of a European Union trade pact.

Two days later, Ukraine&#x27;s parliament dismissed five judges of the Constitutional Court for allegedly violating their oaths, who were then investigated for alleged malpractice.

===Disavowal by party===
Yanukovych was soon disowned by the Party of Regions. In a statement issued by Oleksandr Yefremov, parliamentary faction leader, the party and its members &quot;strongly condemn[ed] the criminal orders that led to human victims, an empty state treasury, huge debts, shame before the eyes of the Ukrainian people and the entire world.&quot;

===Fleeing to Russia ===
Yanukovych left Kyiv during the night of 21–22 February 2014 and initially moved to Kharkiv. According to then governor of Kharkiv Oblast, Mykhailo Dobkin, Yanukovych had intended to make his stay in Kharkiv look like &quot;just another presidential inspection tour&quot; and according to Dobkin, &quot;was desperate to make it look like he wasn&#x27;t running away&quot;. Yanukovych asked Dobkin to &quot;pick out a few factories for me to visit&quot;; the director of state-owned industrial giant Turboatom declined even to take his call (according to Dobkin). Dobkin met Yanukovych at Kharkiv International Airport after midnight. According to Dobkin at that time Yanukovych &quot;thought this was a temporary difficulty&quot; since he believed that the 21 February agreement could still provide for a graceful departure from office later in the year. Dobkin&#x27;s impression of Yanukovych (during this meeting) was &quot;a guy on another planet&quot;.

In a press conference several days after leaving Kyiv, Yanukovych claimed that at the time he did not &quot;flee anywhere&quot;, but that his car was shot at &quot;by automatic rifles&quot; as he left Kyiv for Kharkiv &quot;to meet the representatives of local parties&quot; and he was then forced to move around Ukraine amid fears for the safety of himself and his family. He said &quot;When we arrived in Kharkiv, on the early morning of 22 February, the security service started to receive information that radical groups were arriving in Kharkiv.&quot;

According to the Ukrainian State Border Service, Yanukovych tried to flee Ukraine via a charter flight from Donetsk, but was stopped by border guards. Putin and Yanukovych later stated that Russian forces helped Yanukovych fly to Russia via Crimea on 24 February 2014.

Following his flight from Kyiv, protesters gained entry to Yanukovych&#x27;s Mezhyhirya Residence, as police and security had abandoned their posts. Ukrainians were amazed at the opulence and extravagance of what they found at Mezhyhirya, including a private zoo, a fleet of cars, and a large boat.

On 26 February 2014, Russian media company RBC reported Yanukovych&#x27;s presence in Moscow. According to RBC sources, Yanukovych arrived at the Radisson Royal Hotel, Moscow (often referred by its former name as &quot;Hotel Ukraine&quot;) on the night of 25 February 2014. Then he moved to the Barvikha Sanatorium, the health resort of the president of Russia in Moscow Oblast. RosBusinessConsulting also reported sightings of Viktor Pshonka, a former Prosecutor General of Ukraine in the hall of Radisson Royal Hotel. The Press Secretary of the department that manages Barvikha Sanatorium denied the report, stating that he had no information of Yanukovych settled in Barvikha Sanatorium.

According to an April 2014 poll conducted by the Razumkov Centre, only 4.9% of respondents would have liked to see Yanukovych return to the presidency.

The EU association agreement was signed on 29 May 2014, after his removal.

==Exile==
According to Russian politician Oleg Mitvol, Yanukovych bought a house in Barvikha for $52 million on 26 February 2014.

On 27 February 2014, a report stated that Yanukovych had asked the authorities of the Russian Federation to guarantee his personal security in the territory of Russia, a request that they accepted. Yanukovych claimed that the decisions of the Ukrainian parliament adopted &quot;in the atmosphere of extremist threats&quot; are unlawful and he remains the &quot;legal president of Ukraine&quot;. He accused the opposition of violation of the 21 February agreements and asked the armed forces of Ukraine not to intervene in the crisis. The exact whereabouts of Yanukovych when he made this statement was unclear. In a June 2015 interview with BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; he thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for &quot;saving his life&quot;.

In an April 2014 poll by Kyiv International Institute of Sociology those polled in southern and eastern Ukraine were generally split on the legitimacy of the then Yatsenyuk government and parliament, but a majority in all regions agreed that Yanukovych was not the legal president of the country.

On 3 October 2014, several news agencies reported that according to a Facebook post made by the aide to the Ukrainian Interior Minister, Anton Gerashchenko, Viktor Yanukovych had been granted Russian citizenship by a &quot;secret decree&quot; of Putin. On the same day, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that he didn&#x27;t know anything about this.

On 26 November 2015, Yanukovych received a temporary asylum certificate in Russia for one year; later extended until November 2017. In October 2017, this was extended for another year. According to his lawyer Yanukovych did not consider acquiring Russian citizenship or a permanent residence permits but &quot;Only a temporary shelter for returning to the territory of Ukraine&quot;. In 2017, Russian media suggested that Yanukovych is apparently living in Bakovka near Moscow, in a residence owned by Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

===Position of Yanukovych on his removal===
In a press conference in Rostov-on-Don on 28 February 2014, Yanukovych stated that all his possessions had been legally declared and accounted for. The same day Swiss and Austrian authorities blocked Yanukovych&#x27;s and his associates&#x27; assets, and launched a corruption investigation.

Yanukovych said that an &quot;armed coup&quot; had taken place in Ukraine, and that he was still the legitimate president because there had been no impeachment, resignation, or death. On 11 March he claimed he should return to Ukraine as soon as this was possible.

Yanukovych stated he had been able to escape to Russia &quot;thanks to patriotic officers who did their duty and helped me stay alive&quot;. In the press conference he stated that he was still President of Ukraine and &quot;I can&#x27;t find words to characterise this new authority. These are people who advocate violence – the Ukrainian parliament is illegitimate&quot;. He described the new Ukrainian authorities as &quot;pro-fascist thugs&quot; and that they &quot;represent the absolute minority of the population of Ukraine&quot;.

He apologised to the Ukrainian people for not having &quot;enough strength to keep stability&quot; and for allowing &quot;lawlessness in this country&quot;. He vowed to return to Ukraine &quot;as soon as there are guarantees for my security and that of my family&quot;. He insisted he had not instructed Ukrainian forces to shoot at Euromaidan protesters.

He did not take part in the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election since he &quot;believe[d] they are unlawful...&quot;. He said he was surprised (&quot;knowing the character of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin&quot;) by the silence of Putin, on the events in Ukraine. He hoped to find out more on Russia&#x27;s position when he meets with Mr. Putin &quot;as soon as he has time&quot;.

===The issue of Russian military intervention 2014===
On 28 February 2014 Yanukovych claimed &quot;eastern Ukraine will rise up as soon as they have to live without any means&quot;. On 28 February 2014 the BBC reported him as insisting that military action was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and as stating that he would not request Russian military intervention.

Russia&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin told the UN Security Council on 4 March 2014 that Yanukovych had asked Russia to send troops across the Russia–Ukraine border to protect civilians via a letter to Putin on 1 March 2014. On 4 March 2014 Putin answered questions of reporters about the situation in Crimea. In this interview he claimed &quot;if I do decide to use the Armed Forces, this will be a legitimate decision in full compliance with both general norms of international law, since we have the appeal of the legitimate President.&quot;

In an interview with the Associated Press and Russian channel NTV of 2 April 2014 Yanukovych called Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea &quot;a tragedy&quot;, the 2014 Crimean referendum &quot;a form of protest&quot; and he stated he hopes it will become part of Ukraine again. Yanukovych said he would try to persuade Putin to return Crimea to Ukraine. He squarely blamed the Yatsenyuk Government and acting Ukrainian president Oleksandr Turchynov for Ukraine&#x27;s loss of Crimea. He said he gave no orders to open fire on Euromaidan protesters.

Yanukovych said: &quot;We must set such a task and search for ways to return to Crimea on any conditions, so that Crimea may have the maximum degree of independence possible... but be part of Ukraine.&quot;

===March 2014 to December 2021===
At a press-conference in Rostov-On-Don on 11 March 2014 Yanukovych asked the Ukrainian military to disobey the &quot;criminal orders&quot; of a &quot;band of ultranationalists and neofascists&quot;. He called the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election illegal, as well as U.S. financial help, since US law allegedly did not allow the support of &quot;bandits&quot;. Yanukovych stated he would like to ask the Western supporters of the Yatsenyuk Government that he referred to as &quot;dark powers&quot;: &quot;Have you become blind? Have you forgotten what fascism is?&quot; alluding to the fact that several positions in the transitional government went to representatives of the right-wing extremist nationalist group Svoboda, condemned by the EU in 2012 (see Svoboda Party). Unlike his 28 February press conference, Yanukovych did not take questions from reporters.

On 28 March 2014, Yanukovych asked the Party of Regions to exclude him. He was excluded on 29 March during a party congress along with several senior figures of his régime.

On 13 April, Yanukovych again gave a press conference in Rostov-on-Don, this time accompanied by former Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka and former interior minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko.

On 13 June 2014, Yanukovych released a video message in which he criticised Poroshenko&#x27;s handling of the unrest in eastern Ukraine, naming it &quot;criminal orders to kill people...that causes anger and curse the mothers who see the death and suffering of their children&quot;. Russian media had previously reported that Yanukovych, along with his wife, had moved to Sochi.

On 21 February 2015, a year after the revolution, Yanukovych gave an interview to Channel One regarding the situation in Ukraine and promised to return to power as soon as he could.

On 18 June 2015, Yanukovych was officially deprived of the title of President of Ukraine.

On 22 June 2015, Yanukovych was interviewed on &quot;BBC Newsnight&quot; and he accepted some responsibility for the deaths just before his removal from power.

On 7 December 2015, Yanukovych announced his interest in returning to Ukrainian politics.

In a 22 February 2017, interview with Christopher Miller of &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot;, Konstantin Kilimnik explained the existence of a peace effort between Russia and Ukraine called the &quot;Mariupol Plan&quot; in which Viktor Yanukovych would return as president of Russia&#x27;s illegally controlled regions and Crimea in Ukraine. Andriy Artemenko&#x27;s peace plan was known as the &quot;New initiative for Peace&quot;.

On 30 December 2021 Yanukovych filed lawsuits against the Ukrainian parliament at the in a bid to overturn his removal of the constitutional powers as President of Ukraine.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24February 2022. On 2March, &quot;Ukrayinska Pravda&quot; reported that Ukrainian intelligence sources believed that Yanukovych was spotted in Minsk, Belarus, and that it was Russia&#x27;s intention to declare Yanukovych as President of Ukraine in the event of Russian forces gaining control of Kyiv.

On 2 March 2022 the Security Service of Ukraine raided the Kyiv District Administrative Court in an attempt to physically block Yanukovych&#x27;s lawsuits to overturn his removal of the constitutional powers as President of Ukraine to be heard.

According to &quot;Ukrayinska Pravda&quot;&#x27;s sources Yanukovych left Minsk on 7 March 2022, and again he vanished from the public eye.

Russia&#x27;s Kyiv offensive ended in failure, with its forces withdrawing from Kyiv Oblast by 2 April 2022. This seems to have ended any chance of Yanukovych being placed in power.

In 2023, Yanukovych was stripped of his Ukrainian citizenship by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

==Criminal cases==
Since the revolution, Yanukovych has been convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; of high treason against Ukraine. He is wanted by the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, charged with responsibility for mass murder of the Maidan protesters, as well as abuse of power, misappropriation of public funds, bribery, and property theft.

On 28 February 2014, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, Oleh Makhnitsky, formally asked Russia to extradite Yanukovych. Russian prosecutors stated that they had not received such a request from Ukraine. To date, Russia has declined to extradite him.

=== Sanctions ===

Due to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation he was put on the US sanctions list on 17 March 2014, an action which had been already previously been considered.

He was sanctioned by the British government on 6 March 2014 in relation to the Russo-Ukrainian War.

In 2021 Yanukovych and his son Oleksandr were sanctioned by the EU in relation to his ties to Russia. In August 2023 Yanukovych would be sanctioned again following the opening of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 20 December 2023, the sanctions placed on Yanukovych were recommended to be lifted by the European General Court stating that they &quot;made an error of assessment&quot; by adding Yanukovych to the list, and that they could not confirm without doubt that his other legal cases in Ukraine were tried without prejudice by Ukrainian courts. Shortly afterwards, the European Commission rejected the suggestion and stated that they will not be lifting the EU-wide sanctions on Yanukovych and his son.

On 16 February 2023, Switzerland launched proceedings to confiscate $140.89 million in assets from Yanukovych&#x27;s swiss bank accounts stating that they were of &quot;illicit origin&quot; and his assets will be frozen until the trial is completed.

===Fraud===
On 11 July 2005, the office of the Donetsk Oblast Prosecutor charged Yanukovych with fraud, stemming from alleged irregularities in the way his convictions were expunged twenty years earlier. In 2006, the General Prosecutor closed the case due to lack of evidence. In 2006, a criminal charge was filed for official falsifying of documents concerning the quashing of Yanukovych&#x27;s prior convictions after it was discovered that two documents had been tampered with, including the forgery of a judge&#x27;s signature in connection with one charge of battery.

On 29 January 2010, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine Oleksandr Medvedko claimed that Yanukovych had been unlawfully jailed in his youth.

===Bribery===
After the Euromaidan events the General Prosecutor opened at least four new criminal cases against the former president of Ukraine. This included multiple cash payments to a number of Ukraine&#x27;s top officials which were investigated as suspected bribes. The payments totalled $2 billion over years, ranging from $500,000 to $20 million paid in cash, the recipients included &quot;ministers, heads of agencies, Verkhovna Rada members, civic activists, representatives of international organizations, top judges, including those of the Supreme Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, and the Central Election Commission&quot;.

===Property theft through conspiracy===
Yanukovych is also charged with property theft in a conspiracy with the chairman of the Nadra Ukrainy state company (Articles 109 and 209), which has been under investigation since March 2014.

===Ukrtelekom case===
On 30 September 2014, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine opened a new case against Yanukovych for using ₴220 million of state money to establish his own private communication company based on Ukrtelekom. The prosecutor&#x27;s office also considered that Yanukovych was helped by former government officials Mykola Azarov (prime minister), Yuriy Kolobov (finance minister), Anatoliy Markovsky (first deputy minister of finance), Hennadiy Reznikov (director of Derzhspetszviazok), and Dzenyk (Ukrtelekom board of directors).

===Kharkiv treaty===

Beginning in the summer of 2014, the prosecutor&#x27;s office investigated Yanukovych&#x27;s signing of the Kharkiv treaty, which allowed the Black Sea Fleet to stay in Ukraine for an additional 25 years. Yanukovych is being charged with abuse of power (Article 364) and state treason (Article 111) that are being investigated since April 2014 as well as the new procedure on creation of criminal organization (Article 255) that is being investigated since the summer.

===Mass murder at Maidan===
A warrant for Yanukovych&#x27;s arrest was issued on 24 February 2014 by the interim government, accusing him of responsibility for the mass murder of protesters. Acting Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov declared that Yanukovych had been placed on Ukraine&#x27;s most wanted list and that a criminal case for the mass killings of civilians had been opened against him.

===Interpol===
For several years, Interpol refused to place Viktor Yanukovych on the wanted list as a suspect by the new Ukrainian government for the mass killing of protesters during Euromaidan. However, on 12 January 2015, Viktor Yanukovych was listed by Interpol as &quot;wanted by the judicial authorities of Ukraine for prosecution / to serve a sentence&quot; on charges of &quot;misappropriation, embezzlement or conversion of property by malversation, if committed in respect of an especially gross amount, or by an organized group&quot;.

On 16 July 2015, Russian media reported that Interpol had suspended its Red Notice for Yanukovych. According to the Ukrainian Interpol office, this was a temporary measure due to Yanukovych&#x27;s complaints that the charges were politically motivated. Interpol later confirmed that Viktor Yanukovych and Oleksandr Yanukovych were no longer subject to an Interpol red notice or diffusion, and that they are unknown on Interpol&#x27;s databases. Interpol&#x27;s action followed an application to Interpol by Joseph Hage Aaronson on behalf of Yanukovych seeking his removal from the Interpol wanted list, as according to the law firm, the criminal charges brought by the Ukrainian government against Yanukovych were &quot;part of a pattern of political persecution of him.&quot; In 2017, Yanukovych&#x27;s son was removed from Interpol&#x27;s wanted list.

===Treason===
In November 2016, Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko questioned Yanukovych via video link in connection with the former Berkut. During the questioning, Lutsenko told Yanukovych that he was being accused of treason.

On 14 March 2017, the Prosecutor General submitted to court documents of the Yanukovych&#x27;s case on state treason. Yanukovych was charged with encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine, high treason, and complicity in aggressive warfare by the Russian Federation aimed at altering Ukraine&#x27;s state borders.

More than 100 witnesses were interviewed for the case. One was Denis Voronenkov, who was shot dead in downtown Kyiv at the end of March 2017.

On 4 May 2017 the first preliminary session commenced in Kyiv&#x27;s Obolonskyi District Court under Judge Vladyslav Devyatko. Yanukovych was not present and was tried &quot;in absentia&quot;. He testified via video link from Russia.

In closing arguments on 16 August, prosecutors Ruslan Kravchenko and Maksym Krym asked the court in Kyiv to sentence the former leader to 15 years in prison. The judge then adjourned the trial until 13 September.

However the former leader was hospitalized in Moscow days before he was scheduled to give the final statement. Yanukovych was taken to Moscow&#x27;s Sklifosovsky Institute of Emergency Medicine by ambulance on 16 November in an immobilized condition. He allegedly sustained back and knee injuries while &quot;playing tennis&quot;.

On 24 January 2019 a panel of three judges of the Obolonskyi District Court found Yanukovych guilty of high treason and complicity in Russian military intervention in Ukraine. They stated that &quot;the court, having heard the testimony of witnesses, examined conclusions of experts, documents and material evidence, assessed the arguments of prosecution and defense, considers that the guilt of the accused in committing the crimes under Part 1 Article 111 (high treason), Part 5 Article 27, Part 2 Article 437 (complicity in conducting an aggressive war) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine is duly proved by relevant and admissible evidence&quot;. He was acquitted of the other charge relating to Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The verdict was that Yanukovych was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to 13 years in prison.

==Academic degrees==
The former president&#x27;s official website stated that he graduated from Donetsk Polytechnic Institute with a major in Mechanical Engineering, holds a master&#x27;s degree in International Law at the Ukrainian Academy of Foreign Trade and is a member of the Academy of Economic Sciences of Ukraine, PhD in economics.

According to the Russian website ua.spinform.ru, from December 2000 to February 2004, while in the position of Ukrainian prime minister, Yanukovych headed the Faculty of Innovative Management at the Donetsk State University of Management.

Yanukovych&#x27;s curriculum vitae, published at website europarl.europa.eu, states he is a &quot;Doctor of Economics, Professor, Full Member of the Academy of Economic Sciences of Ukraine, Member of the Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences in Ukraine.&quot;

Website Pravda.com.ua reported that Yanukovych received the honorary title of docent (lecturer) of the Faculty of Automobile Transport at the Donetsk State Academy of Administration, a tertiary education establishment that specialised in Economics and Management
Oleksandr Zakharov, who studied international law at the Academy of Foreign Trade at the same time as Yanukovych, contended that &quot;individual study programs&quot; such as Yanukovych&#x27;s were commonly viewed as a diploma mill for state officials.

==Awards and honors==
==Personal life==

Yanukovych was married to Lyudmyla Oleksandrivna Nastenko. The couple married in 1971. With his wife Yanukovych had two sons, Oleksandr and Viktor, and three grandsons Viktor, Oleksandr and Iliya. From 2006 to 2014, the younger Viktor was a member of the Parliament of Ukraine; he died by drowning at Lake Baikal in 2015. In 2024, Oleksandr received Russian citizenship.

In February 2017, Yanukovych admitted that after 45 years of marriage he had divorced Lyudmyla. &quot;Ukrayinska Pravda&quot; claims that during the Yanukovych presidency, his wife Lyudmyla lived separately in Donetsk. After the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War she reportedly moved to Crimea.

Until 2004, Yanukovych was known as &quot;batia&quot; (&quot;Dad&quot;) among his family members, but since that time he became &quot;leader&quot;. Yanukovych himself stated that his ex-wife did not wish for her grandson to pick up the bad habits of his grandfather, but Yanukovych did not specify what kind of habits those were.

In March 2012, Yanukovych stated it was &quot;a problem&quot; for him in 2002 to speak Ukrainian but that &quot;once I had the opportunity to speak Ukrainian, I started to do it with pleasure&quot;.

==Cultural and political image==

Yanukovych was seen by opponents as representing the interests of Ukrainian big business; they pointed out that his campaigns benefited from backing by Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov. Supporters of Yanukovych pointed out that Donetsk Oblast secured unprecedented levels of investment during his time in office.

Yanukovych drew strong support from Russian-speaking Ukrainians in the east of the country. He is disliked and distrusted in western Ukraine. The People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine labeled his election on 10 February 2010 as &quot;an attack by anti-Ukrainian forces on our state&quot; and stated that &quot;all possible legal means should be used to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of anti-state politician Yanukovych and his pro-Moscow retinue&quot;. On 16 February 2010, Yanukovych issued a statement that read: &quot;I can say only one thing to those who anticipate that my presidency will weaken Ukraine – that will never happen.&quot; Yanukovych refers to himself as Ukrainian. Voters for Yanukovych in 2010 believed he would bring &quot;stability and order&quot;. They blamed the Orange Revolution for creating broken promises, a dysfunctional economy and political chaos. During the 2010 presidential election campaign Yuriy Yakymenko, director of political research at the Razumkov Centre, stated: &quot;I think he has not just changed on the surface but also in his ideas.&quot;

In 2004, Yanukovych was seen as Kuchma&#x27;s and Putin&#x27;s protégé. Kuchma, however, in conversation with United States Ambassador to Ukraine John F. Tefft, in a document dated 2 February 2010 uncovered during the United States diplomatic cables leak, called the voters&#x27; choice between Yanukovych and Yulia Tymoshenko during the second round of the 2010 presidential election a choice between &quot;bad and very bad&quot; and praised Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the candidate eliminated in the first round of the election, instead. In another January 2009 cable then-Ambassador of Ukraine to Russia Kostyantyn Gryshchenko stated that Putin had a low personal regard for Yanukovych. In another Wikileaks diplomatic cable, Volodymyr Horbulin, one of Ukraine&#x27;s most respected policy strategists and former presidential advisor to then-President Viktor Yushchenko, told the United States Ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst in 2006 that Yanukovych&#x27;s Party of Regions was partly composed of &quot;pure criminals&quot; and &quot;criminal and anti-democracy figures.&quot;
Yanukovych is not known as a great speaker. His native language is Russian, similar to a majority of the population of his power-base and native Eastern Ukraine. He, however, made efforts to speak better Ukrainian. He admitted in March 2012 that it was a problem for him in 2002 to speak Ukrainian. He continued making blunders, however, in Ukrainian since then, dubbed &quot;Yanukisms&quot;. For the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, Yanukovych wrote an autobiography for the Central Election Commission, in which he misspelled his academic degree. Thereafter, he came to be widely referred to with this nickname in opposition media and opponents&#x27; speeches. His autobiographic resume of 90 words contains 12 major spelling and grammatical errors. Opponents of Yanukovych made fun of this misspelling and his criminal convictions during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election campaign and the incident during the campaign (September 2004) in Ivano-Frankivsk when Yanukovych was rushed to hospital after being hit by an egg (while government officials claimed he was hit by a brick) was a source of ridicule.

Other famous blunders by Yanukovych are his claim that Anton Chekhov was &quot;a Ukrainian poet&quot; in January 2010, forgetting on 6 January 2011 to congratulate the Greek-Catholic Ukrainian community, which, along with the rest of the Ukrainian people, celebrates Christmas that day, and confusing Kosovo with Serbia and Montenegro, and North Ossetia with South Ossetia in March 2010. In a form filled in for the 2004 election he claimed to be fluent in Ukrainian, yet made in that very form a series of egregious mistakes,e.g., spelling his own wife&#x27;s patronym incorrectly.

Yanukovych stated in November 2009 that he respects all Ukrainian politicians. &quot;I have never offended anyone. This is my rule of politics.&quot; In spite of this claim, on 22 September 2007, during the 2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election campaign, while delivering a speech in Vinnytsia, he compared Tymoshenko&#x27;s performance as prime minister to &quot;a cow on ice&quot;, (&quot;Вона прем&#x27;єр-міністр, як корова на льду...&quot;, &quot;She is a prime minister like a cow on ice&quot;) most likely referring to her skills and professionalism as a prime minister.

Other cases of strong colloquialisms used by Yanukovych include the incident when he called former president Yushchenko &quot;a coward and a babbler&quot;, as well as a speech in Donetsk during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, when he referred to the electorate of his opponent Yushchenko as &quot;goats that make our lives difficult&quot; (&quot;эти козлы, которые нам мешают жить&quot;). Later, during TV debates with Yushchenko he explained, &quot;I called the traitors goats. According to the Bible, the goat is a traitor, and there are also rams, sheep.&quot; After his February 2014 escape to Russia, during his 28 February press conference in Rostov-on-Don, Yanukovych said, &quot;Ukraine is our strategic partner&quot; (misspeaking and confusing Ukraine with Russia). During the same press conference he also broke a pen in an emotional outburst, while trying to apologize to the Ukrainian people.

Opinion polls showed that Yanukovych&#x27;s popularity sank after his election as president in 2010, with polls giving him from 13% to 20% of the votes if a presidential election were to be held in 2012 (in 2010 he received 35.8% of the vote in the first round of that election.) A public opinion poll taken by Sociological group &quot;RATING&quot; gave him 25.1% of the votes in an imaginary February 2013 presidential election.

The Ambassador of the European Union to Ukraine, José Manuel Pinto Teixeira, stated during an April 2012 interview with &quot;Korrespondent&quot; that Yanukovych&#x27;s presidency &quot;fell short of expectations&quot;.

In an overview piece in March 2013, &quot;The Ukrainian Week&quot; claimed that Yanukovych had &quot;failed to meet&quot; his 2010 election promises.

===Paul Manafort consultancy ===
In December 2004 Yanukovych and his Party of Regions hired American political consultant Paul Manafort as an adviser. He continued to serve in that role through the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, even as the US government opposed Yanukovych. Manafort&#x27;s task was to rehabilitate Yanukovych&#x27;s political career in the aftermath of the Orange Revolution. According the Party of Regions&#x27; accounting book (), Manafort, who after the Orange Revolution provided strong support to Yanukovych, received funds from the Party of Regions via the Belize based Neocom Systems Limited&#x27;s account at the Kyrgyzstan based Asia Universal Bank (AUB) on 14 October 2009.

Manafort hired the public relations firm Edelman to lift Yanukovych&#x27;s public image. However, Manafort&#x27;s friends said that Yanukovych &quot;stopped listening&quot; to him after he became president in 2010; Manafort warned him of the consequences of &quot;extreme&quot; political measures.

Manafort later went on to serve as campaign chairman for Donald Trump in 2016. The American FBI began a criminal investigation into Manafort&#x27;s business dealings while he was lobbying for Yanukovych. American federal prosecutors alleged that between 2010 and 2014 Manafort was paid more than $60 million by Ukrainian sponsors, including Rinat Akhmetov, believed to be the richest man in Ukraine.

In January 2019, Manafort resigned from the Connecticut bar.

<text>Atef Muhammad Ebeid (, ; 14 April 1932 – 12 September 2014) was an Egyptian politician who served in various capacities in the governments of Egypt. He was Prime Minister of Egypt from 1999 to 2004.

==Early life and education==
Ebeid was born in Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, on 14 April 1932. He graduated from Cairo University in 1955 and received a PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1962.

==Career==
Ebeid was professor of business at Cairo University until joining politics. In the 1980s he was the Minister of Cabinet Affairs. He served as the Minister for Domestic Development under the Sedki government, and then as Minister of Planning in the government of Kamal Ganzouri. He served as Prime Minister from 5 October 1999 to July 2004. He was sworn in on 5 October 1999, replacing Ganzouri.

Ebeid served as the acting president of Egypt from 20 June 2004 to 6 July 2004, a period during which President Hosni Mubarak was receiving medical treatment in Germany. He was also an economic advisor to Mubarak. He resigned on 9 July 2004, amid increasing pressure from part of the business community demanding more rapid privatization and less state regulation. Ahmed Nazif replaced him in the post.

Then Ebeid headed the Arab International Bank, a popular post with former Egyptian prime ministers. In April 2011 he was removed from office by Prime Minister Essam Sharaf due to corruption allegations. He also wrote for the &quot;Akhbar Alyoum&quot;.

===Controversy===
Ebeid was sentenced to ten years in prison on 1 March 2012 for squandering public funds. His assets were also frozen previously. In early January 2013 the Egypt&#x27;s Court of Appeal overturned the verdict and ordered the ex-PM&#x27;s retrial, which was held at late January 2013. The court again acquitted him of fraud charges in land case. He died on 12 September 2014.

<text>Cándido Muatetema Rivas (20 February 1960 – 16 June 2014) was a political figure in Equatorial Guinea who was Prime Minister from 2001 to 2004.

==Biography==
Muatetema was born in Batete, a village in southern Fernando Po (today Bioko) near Luba. His maternal side, the Rivas, was of Cuban descent.

Muatetema was General Treasurer of the State from November 1991 to August 1993 and served in the government as Secretary of State for Youth and Sports from December 1993 to January 1996. He was also a co-founder of the youth section of the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE) and was the youth section&#x27;s General Coordinator from 1993 to 1995. He later became Deputy Secretary-General of the PDGE.

From June 1996 to February 2001, Muatetema was Second Secretary of the Chamber of People&#x27;s Representatives. He was also a member of CEMAC&#x27;s Inter-Parliamentary Commission and Vice-President of its Economic Affairs Sub-Commission from April 2000 to February 2001.

Muatetema was appointed prime minister by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema on 26 February 2001, succeeding Ángel Serafín Seriche Dougan. His government was sworn in on 27 February and President Obiang emphasized on this occasion that it needed to show unity and &quot;cohesion&quot;.

Muatetema and his government resigned on 11 July 2004, and Obiang appointed Miguel Abia Biteo Boricó to succeed him on 14 July. The structure of his government was a cabinet with 50 ministerial posts.

He was appointed Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s Ambassador to Germany in 2005, a posting he held until his death in 2014.

Cándido Muatetema Rivas died in Berlin, Germany, on 16 June 2014, at the age of 54.

<doc id="393810" wikidata="Q961847" url="?curid=393810" title="Richardson number">
<text>The Richardson number (Ri) is named after Lewis Fry Richardson (1881–1953). It is the dimensionless number that expresses the ratio of the buoyancy term to the flow shear term:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is gravity, formula_3 is density, formula_4 is a representative flow speed, and formula_5 is depth.

The Richardson number, or one of several variants, is of practical importance in weather forecasting and in investigating density and turbidity currents in oceans, lakes, and reservoirs.

When considering flows in which density differences are small (the
Boussinesq approximation), it is common to use the reduced gravity
&quot;g&#x27; &quot; and the relevant parameter is the densimetric Richardson number

:formula_6

which is used frequently when considering atmospheric or oceanic flows.

If the Richardson number is much less than unity, buoyancy is unimportant
in the flow. If it is much greater than unity, buoyancy is dominant (in
the sense that there is insufficient kinetic energy to homogenize the fluids).

If the Richardson number is of order unity, then the flow is likely to
be buoyancy-driven: the energy of the flow derives from the potential energy in the system originally.

== Aviation ==
In aviation, the Richardson number is used as a rough measure of expected air turbulence. A lower value indicates a higher degree of turbulence. Values in the range 10 to 0.1 are typical, with values below unity indicating significant turbulence.

== Thermal convection ==

In thermal convection problems, Richardson number represents the importance of natural convection relative to the forced convection. The Richardson number in this context is defined as

: formula_7

where &quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration, formula_8 is the thermal expansion coefficient, &quot;T&quot;hot is the hot wall temperature, &quot;T&quot;ref is the reference temperature, &quot;L&quot; is the characteristic length, and &quot;V&quot; is the characteristic velocity.

The Richardson number can also be expressed by using a combination of the Grashof number and Reynolds number,

: formula_9

Typically, the natural convection is negligible when Ri &lt; 0.1, forced convection is negligible when Ri &gt; 10, and neither is negligible when 0.1 &lt; Ri &lt; 10. It may be noted that usually the forced convection is large relative to natural convection except in the case of extremely low forced flow velocities. However, buoyancy often plays a significant role in defining the laminar–turbulent transition of a mixed convection flow. In the design of water filled thermal energy storage tanks, the Richardson number can be useful.

== Meteorology ==
In atmospheric science, several different expressions for the Richardson number are commonly used: the flux Richardson number (which is fundamental), the gradient Richardson number, and the bulk Richardson number.

* The flux Richardson number formula_10 is the ratio of buoyant production (or suppression) of turbulence kinetic energy to the production of turbulence by shear. Mathematically, this is:
:formula_11,
where formula_12 is the virtual temperature, formula_13 is the virtual potential temperature, formula_5 is the altitude, formula_4 is the formula_16 component of the wind, formula_17 is the formula_18 component of the wind, and formula_19 is the formula_5 (vertical) component of the wind. A prime (e.g. formula_21) denotes a deviation of the respective field from its Reynolds average.
* The gradient Richardson number formula_22 is arrived at by approximating the flux Richardson number using &quot;K-theory&quot;. This results in:
:formula_23.

* The bulk Richardson number formula_24 results from making a finite difference approximation to the derivatives in the expression for the gradient Richardson number, giving:
:formula_25.
Here, for any variable formula_26, formula_27, i.e. the difference between formula_26 at altitude formula_29 and altitude formula_30. If the lower reference level is taken to be formula_31, then formula_32 (due to the no-slip boundary condition), so the expression simplifies to:
:formula_33.

== Oceanography ==
In oceanography, the Richardson number has a more general form which takes stratification into account. It is a measure of relative importance of mechanical and density effects in the water column, as described by the Taylor–Goldstein equation, used to model Kelvin–Helmholtz instability which is driven by sheared flows.

:formula_34

where &quot;N&quot; is the Brunt–Väisälä frequency and &quot;u&quot; the wind speed.

The Richardson number defined above is always considered positive. A negative value of &quot;N²&quot; (i.e. complex &quot;N&quot;) indicates unstable density gradients with active convective overturning. Under such circumstances the magnitude of negative Ri is not generally of interest. It can be shown that Ri &lt; 1/4 is a necessary condition for velocity shear to overcome the tendency of a stratified fluid to remain stratified, and some mixing (turbulence) will generally occur. When Ri is large, turbulent mixing across the stratification is generally suppressed.

<text>Scotts Bluff National Monument is located west of the City of Gering in western Nebraska, United States. This National Park Service site protects over 3,000 acres of historic overland trail remnants, mixed-grass prairie, rugged badlands, towering bluffs and riparian area along the North Platte River. The park boasts over 100,000 annual visitors.

The monument&#x27;s north bluff is named after Hiram Scott, who was a clerk for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company and died near the bluff in 1828. The bluff served as an important landmark on the Oregon Trail, California Trail and Pony Express Trail, and was visible at a distance from the Mormon Trail. Over 250,000 westward emigrants passed by Scotts Bluff between 1843 and 1869. It was the second-most referred to landmark on the Emigrant Trails in pioneer journals and diaries.

Scotts Bluff County and the city of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, were named after the landmark.

Although called &quot;Scotts Bluff National Monument,&quot; the site includes two separate bluffs, &quot;South Bluff&quot; and the northern bluff called &quot;Scotts Bluff.&quot; There are five major outcroppings on the bluffs, known as Dome Rock, Crown Rock, Sentinel Rock, Eagle Rock and Saddle Rock. The area between Scotts Bluff and the North Platte River is known as the &quot;Badlands.&quot;

==History==
===Charting the landmark===
The collection of bluffs was first charted in 1812 by the Astorian Expedition of fur traders traveling along the river. The expedition party noted the bluffs as the first large rock formations along the North Platte River where the Great Plains started giving way to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Their findings were not widely communicated because of the War of 1812. Explorers rediscovered the route to the Rocky Mountains in 1823, and fur traders in the region relied on the bluffs as a landmark. European Americans named the north, and most prominent bluff, after Hiram Scott, a fur trader who died in 1828 near the bluffs. The local Native Americans had called it Me-a-pa-te, &quot;the hill that is hard to go around.&quot;

===Emigrant trail landmark===

Fur traders, missionaries, and military expeditions began regular trips past Scotts Bluff during the 1830s. Beginning in 1841, multitudes of settlers passed by Scotts Bluff on their way west along the Great Platte River Road to Oregon, and later California and Utah. All these groups used the bluff as a major landmark for navigation.

Although a natural gap existed between South Bluff and Scotts Bluff, the area was not easily traversed. So initially the Oregon Trail passed to the south of the Scotts Bluff area at Robidoux Pass and the Mormon Trail passed to the north of the bluff, on the other side of the North Platte River. In the early 1850s a road was constructed in the gap, which later became known as Mitchell Pass. Beginning in 1851, this new passage became the preferred route of the Oregon and California Trails; although the Mormon Trail continued to pass the bluff only at a distance. Who built the road through Mitchell Pass about 1850 is unknown, although one possibility includes soldiers from Fort Laramie. Many emigrants preferred this route rather than trying to traverse the badlands on the north side of the bluffs or detouring south to the older trail at Robidoux Pass. Use of the Emigrant Trail tapered off in 1869 after the trail was superseded by the completion of the transcontinental railroad.

===Settlement in the Scotts Bluff area===
The town of Gering, Nebraska, was founded near the base of the bluff in 1887, and the city of Scottsbluff was founded across the North Platte River from the bluff in 1900. Separated (or joined) by the river, the two cities have since grown together and now form the 6th-largest urban area in Nebraska.

Once permanent settlements had been established nearby, residents and travelers went to the bluff as a destination because of its extensive views of the flat land stretching to the east, the hills and mountains to the west, and the river valley in between. Developers built various trails up the bluff over the years, but most were precarious and dangerous. In the early 20th century, the National Park Service constructed a safer, more modern trail for improved access.

===National Monument===

The Department of Interior designated Scotts Bluff and several nearby bluffs as a National Monument on December 12, 1919; they were placed for management under the National Park Service, created just three years prior.

The Oregon Trail Museum and Visitor Center was built at the base of the bluff which serves as a start for hiking tours of the bluffs. Exhibits focus on the westward expansion and pioneers, the drawings and paintings of William Henry Jackson, and the geology and paleontology of the region.

In the 1930s, a roadway leading to the top of Scotts Bluff was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, organized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration. The road goes through three tunnels on its way to the top and provides easy access to the summit.

All historic sites administered by the National Park Service were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, when it was established.

==Name==
===The naming of Scotts Bluff===
According to Washington Irving, around 1825 a fur trapping party was “descending the upper part of the (Nebraska) River in canoes when their frail barks were overturned and all their powder spoiled. Their rifles being thus rendered useless they were unable to procure food by hunting and had to depend upon roots and wild fruits for subsistence. After suffering extremely from hunger, they arrived at Laramie’s Fork, a small tributary of the north branch of the Nebraska, about sixty miles above the cliffs just mentioned. Here, one of their party by the name of Scott was taken ill; and his companions came to a halt, until he should recover health and strength sufficient to proceed. While they were searching round in quest of edible roots they discovered a fresh trail of white men, who had evidently but recently preceded them. What was to be done? By a forced march they might overtake this party, and thus be able to reach the settlements in safety. Should they linger they might all perish of famine and exhaustion. Scott, however, was incapable of moving; they were too feeble to aid him forward, and dreaded that such a clog would prevent them coming up with the advance party. They determined, therefore, to abandon him to his fate. Accordingly, under pretense of seeking food, and such simples as might be efficacious in his malady, they deserted him and hastened forward upon the trail. They succeeded in overtaking the party of which they were in quest, but concealed their faithless desertion of Scott; alleging that he had died of disease.

“On the ensuing summer, these very individuals, visiting these parts in company with others, came suddenly upon the bleached bones and grinning skull of a human skeleton, which by certain signs, they recognized for the remains of Scott. This was sixty long miles from the place where they had abandoned him; and it appeared that the wretched man had crawled that immense distance before death put an end to his miseries. The wild and picturesque bluffs in the neighborhood of his lonely grave have ever since borne his name.”

Another version of the legend portrays Scott&#x27;s companions in more favorable terms:
A melancholy tradition accounts for the name of this spot. A party who had been trading with the Indians were returning to the States and encountering a band of hostile savages, were robbed of their peltries and food. As they struggled homeward, one of the number, named Scott, fell sick and could not travel. The others remained with him, until the sufferer, despairing of ever beholding his home, prevailed on his companions to abandon him. They left him alone in the wilderness, several miles from this spot. Here human bones were afterwards found; and, supposing he had crawled here and died, the subsequent travelers have given his name to the neighboring bluff.

===Proper spelling===
There has always been some disagreement as to the proper spelling of this geomorphic feature, specifically with regard to the apostrophe. For example, an 1843 map titled &quot;Map of an Exploratory Expedition to the Mountains in 1842&quot; by John C. Frémont labeled the feature &quot;Scott&#x27;s Bluff&quot; (with an apostrophe). Another early military map of Nebraska and the Dakotas published in 1875 by G.K. Warren dropped the apostrophe and labeled the feature simply as &quot;Scotts Bluff&quot;. There are numerous other examples in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in which the name has been spelled with or without an apostrophe. In a final decision by the United States Board on Geographical Names rendered on June 11, 1941, the name &quot;Scotts Bluff&quot; (without an apostrophe) was officially adopted. The nearby town of Scottsbluff is spelled as one word.
==Geology==

The oldest rocks visible within the monument are the Oligocene siltstones and mudstones of the Orella Member of the Brule Formation. The overlying Whitney Member in the same formation has volcaniclastic siltstones originating from volcanic centers to the west. An unconformity separates the Brule from the overlying Gering Formation, composed of fluvial sediments. Next in the geologic sequence is the Miocene Monroe Creek–Harrison Formations that include eolian features such as cross-bedding and ripple marks. These formations include the caprock, composed of hard, lime-cemented ledges called “pipy” concretions formed when calcium carbonate (lime) precipitated from groundwater.

==Trails at the Monument==

Summit Trails
The North Overlook Trail is a paved trail that leaves from the summit parking lot and overlooks the North Platte River Valley. Visitors can reach the highest point on the bluff at above sea level.
The South Overlook Trail is a paved trail that leaves from the summit parking lot towards the south. From the overlook, visitors can see the Visitor Center and Mitchell Pass.
Saddle Rock Trail begins at the Visitor Center and climbs in . The first third of the trail is relatively level from the Visitor Center to Scott&#x27;s Spring. From here, the trail climbs rapidly most of the in to the summit parking lot. 
The Oregon Trail Pathway is a short trail ascending in . The trail begins at the display of a Murphy and Conestoga wagons and ends in Mitchell Pass.
The Bike Path is the only trail available to users other than hikers. It runs from the Visitor Center to the eastern boundary of the park. It drops in .

==Legacy==
Scotts Bluff County and the city of Scottsbluff were named after the landmark.

During World War II, the United States built hundreds of T2 oil tanker ships and named many of them after national monuments. The &quot;SS Scotts Bluff&quot; was built in 1944, served in the war, and then its name was changed when it was sold to France in 1948.

<doc id="393813" wikidata="Q895274" url="?curid=393813" title="Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)">
<text>In fluid dynamics, the Boussinesq approximation (, named for Joseph Valentin Boussinesq) is used in the field of buoyancy-driven flow (also known as natural convection). It ignores density differences except where they appear in terms multiplied by , the acceleration due to gravity. The essence of the Boussinesq approximation is that the difference in inertia is negligible but gravity is sufficiently strong to make the specific weight appreciably different between the two fluids. The existence of sound waves in a Boussinesq fluid is not possible as sound is the result of density fluctuations within a fluid.

Boussinesq flows are common in nature (such as atmospheric fronts, oceanic circulation, katabatic winds), industry (dense gas dispersion, fume cupboard ventilation), and the built environment (natural ventilation, central heating). The approximation can be used to simplify the equations describing such flows, whilst still describing the flow behaviour to a high degree of accuracy.

==Formulation==
The Boussinesq approximation is applied to problems where the fluid varies in temperature (or composition) from one place to another, driving a flow of fluid and heat transfer (or mass transfer). The fluid satisfies conservation of mass, conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. In the Boussinesq approximation, variations in fluid properties other than density are ignored, and density only appears when it is multiplied by , the gravitational acceleration. If is the local velocity of a parcel of fluid, the continuity equation for conservation of mass is
:formula_1
If density variations are ignored, this reduces to
The general expression for conservation of momentum of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid (the Navier–Stokes equations) is
:formula_2
where (nu) is the kinematic viscosity and is the sum of any body forces such as gravity. In this equation, density variations are assumed to have a fixed part and another part that has a linear dependence on temperature:
:formula_3

where is the coefficient of thermal expansion. The Boussinesq approximation states that the density variation is only important in the buoyancy term.

If formula_4 is the gravitational body force, the resulting conservation equation is

{\partial t} + \left( \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla \right) \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho_0}\nabla (p-\rho_0\mathbf{g}\cdot\mathbf{z}) + \nu\nabla^2 \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{g}\alpha(T-T_0).&lt;/math&gt;|}}

In the equation for heat flow in a temperature gradient, the heat capacity per unit volume, formula_5, is assumed constant and the dissipation term is ignored. The resulting equation is

where is the rate per unit volume of internal heat production and formula_6 is the thermal conductivity.

The three numbered equations are the basic convection equations in the Boussinesq approximation.

==Advantages==
The advantage of the approximation arises because when considering a flow of, say, warm and cold water of density and one needs only to consider a single density : the difference is negligible. Dimensional analysis shows that, under these circumstances, the only sensible way that acceleration due to gravity should enter into the equations of motion is in the reduced gravity where

:formula_7

(Note that the denominator may be either density without affecting the result because the change would be of order
.) The most generally used dimensionless number would be the Richardson number and Rayleigh number.

The mathematics of the flow is therefore simpler because the density ratio , a dimensionless number, does not affect the flow; the Boussinesq approximation states that it may be assumed to be exactly one.

==Inversions==

One feature of Boussinesq flows is that they look the same when viewed upside-down, provided that the identities of the fluids are reversed. The Boussinesq approximation is &quot;inaccurate&quot; when the dimensionless density difference is approximately 1, i.e. .

For example, consider an open window in a warm room. The warm air inside is less dense than the cold air outside, which flows into the room and down towards the floor. Now imagine the opposite: a cold room exposed to warm outside air. Here the air flowing in moves up toward the ceiling. If the flow is Boussinesq (and the room is otherwise symmetrical), then viewing the cold room upside down is exactly the same as viewing the warm room right-way-round. This is because the only way density enters the problem is via the reduced gravity which undergoes only a sign change when changing from the warm room flow to the cold room flow.

An example of a non-Boussinesq flow is bubbles rising in water. The behaviour of air bubbles rising in water is very different from the behaviour of water falling in air: in the former case rising bubbles tend to form hemispherical shells, while water falling in air splits into raindrops (at small length scales surface tension enters the problem and confuses the issue).
