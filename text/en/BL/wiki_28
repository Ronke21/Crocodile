<text>William Nelson (born 18 December 1948) is an English singer, guitarist, songwriter, producer, painter, video artist, writer and experimental musician. He rose to prominence as the chief songwriter, vocalist and guitarist of the rock group Be-Bop Deluxe, which he formed in 1972. Nelson has been described as &quot;one of the most underrated guitarists of the seventies art rock movement&quot;. In 2015, he was recognised with the Visionary award at the Progressive Music Awards.

== Personal life ==
Nelson was born in Wakefield in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to Jean and Walter Nelson. His father was an alto saxophone player, and his mother a dancer. Nelson&#x27;s younger brother, Ian (1956–2006), collaborated on the Be-Bop Deluxe song &quot;Ships in the Night&quot; and formed the band Fiat Lux; he also played on the 1979 Red Noise album &quot;Sound-on-Sound&quot; and with the 2004 touring band Bill Nelson and the Lost Satellites.

Nelson has three children, Julia (born 1970 with Bill’s first wife, Shirley) and Elle (born 1978) and Elliot (born 1981), both born with Bill’s second wife, Jan. Elle and Elliot played in their own band, Honeytone Cody, between the late 1990s and 2014. Some time around April 1995 Nelson married Emiko, who was previously married to Yellow Magic Orchestra drummer Yukihiro Takahashi.

== Career ==
=== 1970s ===
Nelson was educated at the Wakefield College of Art, where he developed an interest in the work of poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau. At this time he was also developing as a musician, drawing upon Duane Eddy as a primary guitar influence.

His first record was a brief contribution on the album &quot;A-Austr: Musics from Holyground&quot;, with Brian Calvert, Chris Coombs, Ted Hepworth, Mike Levon and Brian Wilson. Levon recorded and produced the album which appeared on Levon&#x27;s own Holyground Records label in 1970. After that, Nelson appeared in a much more substantial role with Lightyears Away on &quot;Astral Navigations&quot; released in 1971. On one track, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, written by Coombs, Levon recorded Nelson&#x27;s lead guitars in an acid rock style, supporting Coombs&#x27; stylophone riff. This track also gave Nelson his first airplay by John Peel on his national BBC Radio 1 programme in the United Kingdom. Nelson&#x27;s Holyground recordings were released in February 2001 as &quot;Electrotype&quot;.

In 1973, Nelson&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Northern Dream&quot;, released on his own independent Smile label, drew further attention from Peel which eventually led to Nelson&#x27;s band Be-Bop Deluxe signing to EMI&#x27;s Harvest Records subsidiary and releasing &quot;Axe Victim&quot; in 1974. Nelson replaced the original band members for &quot;Futurama&quot; in 1975. The lineup of Bill Nelson (guitar), Andrew Clark (keyboards), Charlie Tumahai (bass) and Simon Fox (drums) recorded &quot;Sunburst Finish&quot; and &quot;Modern Music&quot; in 1976, the live album &quot;Live! In The Air Age&quot; in 1977 and their final studio album &quot;Drastic Plastic&quot; in 1978.

Nelson found the structure of a permanent band constricting. An instrumental on &quot;Drastic Plastic&quot; performed by Nelson (acoustic guitar) and Clark (keyboards) anticipated Nelson&#x27;s later solo ambient work. Other tracks on that album required Fox record drum parts for use as repeating loop backing tracks in the studio. (Performing these songs live on the subsequent tour, Fox would physically play these repeating patterns on drums). This sowed the seeds for later experimentation by Nelson. 1983&#x27;s &quot;Invisibility Exhibition&quot; tour would see Bill Nelson (guitar) and Ian Nelson (sax) improvise to the former&#x27;s self-produced backing audio (and video) tracks (later released as the &quot;Chamber of Dreams&quot; album), an approach Nelson would repeat for many solo live performances throughout his career. Playing the guitar over pre-recorded backing tracks would bear further fruit in later studio recordings, notably the &quot;Painting With Guitars&quot; series (2003, 2015) and &quot;And We Fell into A Dream&quot; (2007).

In autumn 1978, Nelson halted the Be-Bop Deluxe project, removed Tumahai and Fox from his immediate working band and replaced the name with the moniker Red Noise (releasing the &quot;Sound-on-Sound&quot; album in February 1979). Harvest, who had insisted on naming it &quot;Bill Nelson&#x27;s Red Noise&quot;, refused to release the second Red Noise album &quot;Quit Dreaming And Get on the Beam&quot; which was largely recorded by Nelson with contributions on sax from his brother Ian rather than the more-obviously marketable five-piece band Harvest&#x27;s execs had understandably expected. The record remained unreleased in record company limbo.

Meanwhile, with his producer from Harvest John Leckie, Nelson did some production (and, in Nelson&#x27;s case, sessions keyboards) work for the band Skids, whose guitarist Stuart Adamson was an admirer of Nelson&#x27;s musicianship. Fruitful friendships followed. Vocalist Richard Jobson would appear as a support act reading poetry on the &quot;Invisibility Exhibition&quot; tour. After Adamson&#x27;s death in 2001, Nelson composed a piece in memory of his departed friend, called simply &quot;For Stuart&quot;, which appeared on 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Romance of Sustain Volume One: Painting With Guitars&quot; and (in a live version) on 2011&#x27;s &quot;live at Metropolis Studios&quot; DVD.

=== 1980s ===
Nelson&#x27;s manager Mark Rye negotiated with Harvest to buy back some of the unreleased songs for Nelson to release under his own name on his own label, Cocteau Records, which Nelson and Rye had set up. Consequently, in July 1980, Nelson was able to release the single &quot;Do You Dream in Colour?&quot;, which after airplay on BBC Radio 1 reached No. 52 in the UK Singles Chart. This debut release on the label persuaded Phonogram to acquire the remaining tracks for Cocteau in order to release &quot;Quit Dreaming And Get on the Beam&quot; as a Bill Nelson album on their subsidiary label Mercury Records in 1981. The release contained bonus disc &quot;Sounding The Ritual Echo (Atmospheres for Dreaming)&quot; featuring experimental, ambient instrumentals which Nelson had recorded privately at his home.

Subsequent Mercury releases included &quot;The Love That Whirls&quot;, which included a bonus disc of Nelson&#x27;s soundtrack for The Yorkshire Actors&#x27; stage production of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1946 film &quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot;/&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. Nelson had already contributed music (and released it under the title &quot;Das Kabinet&quot; on Cocteau) to the same company&#x27;s similar adaptation of Robert Wiene&#x27;s 1920 silent film classic &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;. It was followed by the six-track mini album &quot;Chimera&quot; in 1983, including collaborations with Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s Yukihiro Takahashi and Mick Karn, and featuring prominent use of synthesizers, sequencers and E-bow guitar. A single from the album, &quot;Accelaration&quot;, subsequently reached no.78 on the UK singles chart during a three week chart run.

Nelson released considerable quantities of singles and LPs on Cocteau throughout the decade, much of it by himself but also a number of singles by other artists, notably Last Man in Europe, A Flock of Seagulls, The Revox Cadets, Richard Jobson, Q (16), Fiat Lux, Man Jumping and Yukihiro Takahashi. The more ambitious Cocteau releases by Nelson himself included the four-LP box set of experimental electronic music &quot;Trial by Intimacy (The Book of Splendours)&quot; and the later ambient two-LP collection &quot;Chance Encounters in the Garden of Lights&quot;, which contained music informed by Nelson&#x27;s Gnostic beliefs. In 1989, he released the 4-CD box set &quot;Demonstrations of Affection&quot;.

He was hired by English new wave artist Gary Numan to produce his 1983 album &quot;Warriors&quot;, with Numan saying that Bill Nelson was his &quot;favourite guitar player, bar none.&quot; However, the two musicians failed to maintain a working relationship, and ultimately Nelson chose not to be credited for his production role on the album. Nelson also contributed towards several tracks on David Sylvian&#x27;s &quot;Gone to Earth&quot; (1986). Nelson was commissioned by Channel 4 to write music for the 1987 television drama series &quot;Brond&quot;.

In the 1980s a deal with CBS Records&#x27; Portrait imprint failed, leaving the one album &quot;Getting the Holy Ghost Across&quot; (US title: &quot;On a Blue Wing&quot;) with further tracks from that album&#x27;s sessions issued on the UK mini-LP &quot;Living for the Spangled Moment&quot;. In the late 1980s, Nelson signed to Enigma Records, which went out of business shortly after re-releasing his entire Cocteau catalogue.

As the decade ended, Nelson suffered a series of personal setbacks, including a divorce, tax problems and an acrimonious dispute with his manager over his back catalogue rights. In the case of one album, the unreleased &quot;Simplex&quot;, Nelson discovered his manager had been selling copies via mail order without Nelson&#x27;s authorisation or knowledge; Nelson claimed he never received any royalties from these sales.

=== 1990s ===
In 1992, Nelson released &quot;Blue Moons and Laughing Guitars&quot; on Virgin, which consisted of demos for a proposed band including four guitarists and two drummers which never materialised. &quot;This is what I do behind locked doors,&quot; he wrote on the sleeve, prefiguring much of his later, home recorded work including &quot;My Secret Studio&quot; (4-CD + 2-CD) and &quot;Noise Candy&quot; (6-CD). In the same year, Nelson worked with Roger Eno and Kate St John as producer (with Roger Eno) on the duo&#x27;s album &quot;The Familiar&quot;, on which Nelson also played guitar and other instruments. This experience fortuitously not only sowed the seeds of Eno&#x27;s, Nelson&#x27;s and St.John&#x27;s participation in the &#x27;ambient supergroup&#x27; Channel Light Vessel, which also featured Laraaji and Mayumi Tachibana, but also introduced Nelson to Voiceprint Records, whose subsidiary labels included All Saints and Resurgence, both of which would release a number of CLV and Nelson recordings over the next few years.

In 1995, Nelson released two very different albums. &quot;Crimsworth (Flowers, Stones, Fountains And Flames)&quot; was an ambient piece which had provided the soundscape to an art installation. &quot;Practically Wired, or How I Became... Guitarboy!&quot; was a return to guitar-based instrumental music, something Nelson had barely touched for the previous decade and a half.

In 1996, Nelson augmented his sound with drum and bass for &quot;After The Satellite Sings&quot;, credited as a major influence on David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Earthling&quot; album by Bowie&#x27;s then guitarist Reeves Gabrels.

By 1996, Nelson&#x27;s troubles with his former manager were resolved in a lawsuit which enabled Nelson to recover much of his back catalogue. The fully authorised &quot;Simplex&quot; was subsequently released in 2001 by Lenin Imports and reissued in 2012 by Esoteric.

In the late 1990s, Nelson created the Populuxe label, with a distribution arrangement via Robert Fripp&#x27;s Discipline Global Mobile, but his relationship with them stagnated and Nelson&#x27;s last release on that label was &quot;Atom Shop&quot; in 1998. Subsequent releases have been on other imprints such as Toneswoon as well as direct mail order (and later internet order) releases.

=== 2000s ===
2002 saw the release of EP &quot;Three White Roses &amp; A Budd&quot; (with Fila Brazillia and Harold Budd) on Twentythree Records.

In 2001, Nelson attended a first Nelsonica convention, set up in West Yorkshire by fans in his honour, taking with him drawings to sell to any interested parties. It proved such a good experience that he resolved to contribute live music performances, dedicated CDs of new material, and anything else that seemed appropriate, to any such future events. Nelsonica became an annual fixture in his calendar for the next decade or so. Attendees at 2002&#x27;s Nelsonica 02 received a copy of &quot;Astral Motel&quot;, the first convention CD release. Honeytone Cody played one set, Nelson and his brother Ian played a second, while Nelson&#x27;s newly assembled seven piece band The Lost Satellites, which also included Ian, played a third. It was a resounding success and an annual institution was born.

Three further albums followed in 2003: &quot;The Romance of Sustain Volume One: Painting With Guitars&quot;, &quot;Plaything&quot;, and a second Nelsonica CD &quot;Luxury Lodge&quot;. Since then, Nelson has released an average of four albums a year, often in small runs which soon go out of print. He has accomplished this using his own series of branded record labels: Almost Opaque then Discs of Ancient Odeon for the Nelsonica releases; Universal Twang then Sonoluxe for the others. (Nelson&#x27;s Sonic Masonic imprint lasted for only one release, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Satellite Songs&quot;)

Nelson&#x27;s in-house releasing was made possible by the financial backing of &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; magazine, whose website hosts his online shop and is named after Red Noise&#x27;s &quot;Sound-on-Sound&quot; album. In 2004, the magazine also put up the money for Nelson to take his band Bill Nelson and the Lost Satellites on tour around the UK as The Be-Bop Deluxe And Beyond Tour.

Nelson pursued different artistic directions. Two &quot;Rosewood&quot; releases contained acoustic guitar pieces &quot;submitted to electronic and digital processing.&quot; The highly personal &quot;The Alchemical Adventures of Sailor Bill,&quot; was a concept album about the English coastline, ships and the sea, while its more ambient, instrumental companion piece &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Galaxy&quot; comprised five long form instrumental compositions exploring the same subject. Of the former, Nelson wrote, &quot;this set of songs comes (closer) to being personally fulfilling as almost any other album of mine.&quot; Most of the decade&#x27;s remaining albums were lead electric guitar-oriented and non-vocal. Improvisation against pre-recorded backing tracks played a major role in &quot;And We Fell into A Dream&quot; while the very different &quot;Theatre of Falling Leaves&quot; eschewed lead guitar in favour of keyboards. The decade closed with more voice-based material as Nelson crooned through &quot;Golden Melodies of Tomorrow&quot;, delivered more familiar rock and ballad vocals on &quot;Fancy Planets&quot; and delved into romantic songwriting in &quot;The Dream Transmission Pavilion&quot;.

In the first half of the decade, Nelson published his collected online diaries from 1999–2003 under the title &quot;diary of a hyperdreamer&quot;. A second volume covering entries from 2005–2006 would appear in 2015. The last ten years of this diary remain on his official website to this day. He also gave extensive interviews to biographer Paul Sutton Reeves for a book, the publication of which was put on hold for around two years when publisher Sean Body died. &quot;Music in Dreamland Bill Nelson &amp; Be-Bop Deluxe,&quot; finally materialised in 2008.

In the second half of the decade, Nelson&#x27;s live performances (mostly at the Nelsonica events) broadened out from solo work to encompass two other bands. One was the improvisational, three-piece Orchestra Futura consisting of Nelson, Dave Sturt (bass) and Theo Travis (assorted woodwind, brass). (The duo of Sturt and Travis already played together as Cipher.) The other was the more conventional rock oriented, seven-piece Bill Nelson and the Gentlemen Rocketeers (again including Sturt and Travis) which played songs with vocals from the extensive Nelson/Be-Bop Deluxe back catalogue.

By 2006, Universal Music (UK) had re-issued three Mercury albums: &quot;Quit Dreaming and Get on the Beam&quot;, &quot;The Love that Whirls&quot; and &quot;Chimera&quot; had all been remastered and released with bonus tracks. Sonoluxe had reissued the CBS album &quot;Getting the Holy Ghost Across / On a Blue Wing&quot; with all the original tracks including those from &quot;Living for the Spangled Moment&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Nelson published the first part of an autobiography.

In March 2011, motivated by a desire to capture the flavour of recent gigs on film for posterity via DVD release, Bill Nelson and the Gentlemen Rocketeers played a concert of songs spanning Nelson&#x27;s career before a live audience in front of in-house cameras at Metropolis Studios, London. Dissatisfied with the resultant sound mix, Nelson remixed it himself at his own expense. Using Nelson&#x27;s remix, ITV Studios Home Entertainment released a DVD of the event. This initial release quickly sold out. A promised television broadcast of the recording only materialised in a few selected territories, excluding the UK. The video and audio recording has subsequently been reissued on other formats including CD and LP. However, having signed away his rights to these recordings, Nelson has made no money on these releases.

In 2011, Cherry Red Records&#x27; subsidiary Esoteric Recordings commenced a roll-out re-release of Nelson&#x27;s back catalogue for many of his releases between 1981 and 2002 with the 8-CD compilation &quot;The Practice of Everyday Life&quot; which covered 40 years of recordings. Other notable reissues have included the 4-CD &quot;The Book of Splendours&quot; and the 6-CD &quot;Noise Candy&quot;. The Esoteric deal did not involve a rights buyout, so Nelson is properly compensated for these reissues.

In 2013, Nelson finally began releasing his out of print CD back catalogue from 2002 onwards as digital downloads via Bandcamp. On this platform he subsequently released the three volume compilation &quot;The Dreamer&#x27;s Companion&quot; in 2014 and brand new albums commencing with &quot;Special Metal&quot; from 2016 onwards.

In addition to his numerous solo releases of recent years, Nelson has also made both film soundtracks and a number of collaborative recordings with other artists. In 2010, he released the soundtrack to the US TV documentary &quot;American Stamps&quot; as &quot;Picture Post&quot; while in 2014, he released the soundtrack to UK director Daisy Asquith&#x27;s paean to cycling &quot;Velorama&quot; (a tie in with the 2014 Tour de France cycle race which went through Yorkshire) as &quot;Pedalscope&quot;. In 2012, Nelson finally completed &quot;The Last of the Neon Cynics&quot;, a long standing project with comic artist Matt Howarth: the latter supplied a comic (a PDF file) while the former provided a soundtrack to it. In 2014, he collaborated with fellow guitarist Reeves Gabrels (who has also worked with David Bowie and The Cure) on &quot;Fantastic Guitars&quot;.

In 2014, Nelson suffered a complete hearing loss in his right ear. This put a stop to any plans for playing live (and by extension Nelsonica events built around live performance) for the foreseeable future. Yet he continued to record and release music despite this disability. The first album to be affected was &quot;Quiet Bells&quot;. According to Nelson&#x27;s sleeve notes, &quot;to slowly adjust to this problem, I decided to make an album that features mainly guitar, a gentle collection of instrumentals in a neo-minimalist, ambient style.&quot;

In 2014, Nelson was honoured by Wakefield Council with a Hollywood-style star on the city’s walk of fame. He also designed an extremely limited edition &#x27;Astroluxe Custom Ltd&#x27; guitar for the Eastwood company.

In 2016, 46 years after recording his debut album, Nelson released a sequel entitled &quot;New Northern Dream&quot;.

<text>Augustinas Voldemaras (16 April 1883 – 16 May 1942) was a Lithuanian nationalist political figure. He briefly served as the country&#x27;s first prime minister in 1918 and continued serving as the minister of foreign affairs until 1920, representing the fledgling Lithuanian state at the Versailles Peace Conference and the League of Nations. After some time in academia, Voldemaras returned to politics in 1926, when he was elected to the Third Seimas.

Dissatisfied with the left-wing government of President Kazys Grinius, Voldemaras and fellow nationalist Antanas Smetona supported the military coup d&#x27;état in December 1926 and he was appointed as the prime minister for a second time. A brilliant orator, Voldemaras represented the radical wing of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union that was increasingly critical of the more moderate policies of President Smetona. Smetona had Voldemaras removed from office in September 1929 and exiled to Zarasai. Voldemaras was arrested in 1934 after the failed coup against Smetona and served a prison sentence until exiled to France in 1938. Returning to Lithuania soon after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, he was promptly arrested by the Soviet authorities and died in their custody in Moscow.

==Early life and education==

Voldemaras was born on 16 April 1883 in Dysna village in what is now Ignalina district municipality, Lithuania (then part of the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire). Though born to a family of modest means and education, Augustinas excelled at his studies. He finished the public school in nearby Tverečius and graduated from a three-year school in Švenčionys. In 1890 he moved to Saint Petersburg to join his brother who had been working there. In 1902, Voldemaras passed the exams to enter a gymnasium, eventually graduating with distinction in 1904. While preparing for the exams in 1901, Voldemaras met Antanas Smetona who would become his close friend, political collaborator and, eventually, his political nemesis.

In 1909, Voldemaras graduated in History and Philosophy at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University and, in 1910, received his Master&#x27;s Degree and was awarded a gold medal for his dissertation. A scholarship fund was set up to enable him to further his studies, and eventually he achieved his PhD. After a period of studying in Italy and Sweden, Voldemaras returned to the university (now named Petrograd Imperial University) in 1915 and joined its staff. He moved to Perm to become a professor when the Imperial University opened its branch there (the branch would later become Perm State University). However, Voldemaras was not satisfied with the living conditions in Perm and planned his return to Lithuania.

==Political career==

===Entry into politics===

Voldemaras first entered politics as a student in Saint Petersburg. The nationalism sweeping Lithuania in the Russian Empire included prominent voices calling for Lithuanian independence or autonomy within the Empire. Voldemaras joined the newly established Party of National Progress in 1916 and a group of Lithuanian students in Saint Petersburg, representing it at the Petrograd Seimas in June 1917 and the Congress of Non-Sovereign Nations in Kiev in September 1917. In 1918, he represented Lithuanian interests at the peace negotiations for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Germany and the Soviet Russia. Since Lithuania was not part of the negotiations, he was officially part of the delegation of the short-lived Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. His influence at the conference was minimal and Lithuania was claimed by Germany as part of the settlement.
In 1918, Voldemaras returned to Lithuania and joined the Council of Lithuania after several members left it in protest of its alignment with Germany. One of the many problems facing the council was the lack of unity among Lithuanian organizations — several were claiming to represent Lithuania on the international stage. In September 1918, Voldemaras and Smetona participated in a conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, helping to unite the organizations behind the Council of Lithuania. Events moved rapidly after the defeat of Germany in the World War I. Germany recognized Lithuanian independence and its army withdrew. The Presidium of the Council of Lithuania, which had been acting as a collective head of state, chose Voldemaras as the first Prime Minister of Lithuania and allowed him to form the government.

===On the Government of Lithuania===

Voldemaras assumed power on 11 November 1918 and formed a cabinet, taking two cabinet positions for himself: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. Voldemaras&#x27;s first stated priority was to ensure the internal stability of the country: he hoped that a statement of neutrality would deter foreign interference for a time. Nevertheless, On 23 November he signed the order creating the Lithuanian armed forces and appointed General Kyprian Kandratovich as Deputy Minister of Defense. This appointment proved very unpopular. Kondratovich was an ethnic Belarusian viewed with suspicion by many, failed to take measures to organize the defense of the country and proposed to move the government to Grodno when Vilnius was threatened by a Soviet advance. He was dismissed on 24 December 1918.

Voldemaras and Smetona left Lithuania on 21 December 1918. Their stated purpose of the trip was to secure a badly needed loan from Germany and to participate in the Versailles Peace Conference, but the departure generated outrage in Lithuania, where Voldemaras was seen as fleeing the Soviet advance. In absentia, he was replaced as the prime minister on 26 December 1918 by Mykolas Sleževičius. Furious with these events, Voldemaras nevertheless continued to serve as Minister of Foreign affairs and stayed in Versailles representing Lithuania.

The Lithuanian representatives there focused on recognition of independent Lithuania and its borders, as well as support in its struggle against Bolsheviks. Voldemaras and his colleagues found little support among the Great Powers: those who supported a strong Russia saw Lithuania as an integral part of that state, while the proponents of Poland as a bulwark against Bolshevism thought Lithuanian independence would weaken it. Voldemaras also found it difficult to secure recognition for Lithuania after the end of the conference. The United States refused recognition in November 1919 and granted it only in 1922) and Soviet Russia refused peace negotiations at the beginning of 1920.

In June 1920, Voldemaras resigned along with the rest of the cabinet, to make way for the government formed by the elections to the constituent assembly. Voldemaras did not take part in the assembly, and instead returned to academia.

===Coup d&#x27;état and ascent to power===

Even in academia, Voldemaras continued to publish political articles and essays, often critical of the government. In 1923, his political writings earned him one month of forced labor in Varniai. In 1926, Voldemaras was elected to the Seimas and was particularly critical of President Kazys Grinius and his government, which came to power after the elections of 1926. He saw Grinius as too lenient on minority rights and advocated for a stronger, more dictatorial government like the fascist regimes that were gaining power in much of Europe at the time.

In 1926, a segment of the army that disagreed with the Grinius administration planned a military coup d&#x27;état. They appealed for support to Voldemaras and Antanas Smetona, now leaders of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, and both agreed. The coup took place on 17 December, deposing Grinius and installing Smetona as the president for a second time and Voldemaras as prime minister. To assuage public opinion in both Lithuania and the outside world, Grinius agreed to appoint Voldemaras as the prime minister on condition that he uphold the constitution of 1922. Although Voldemaras did make this commitment, he and Smetona reneged on it within a year, when the Third Seimas was dissolved and no new elections were called. Voldemaras joked at the time that he had promised to hold elections, but had made no promises about in which year. This move prompted the Christian Democrats to leave the government, leaving the Nationalist Union in power as the sole governing party. Finally, in 1928, the constitution of 1922 was scrapped altogether and replaced by a new constitution without following the constitutional procedures and without any sort of approval from the voters or the legislature.

Voldemaras again assumed the role of minister of foreign affairs and prime minister, seeing foreign relations as the key issue of the government. In January 1928, Voldemaras signed a border treaty with Germany, in which Germany accepted Lithuanian possession of Klaipėda (Memel) and also a trade agreement with the United Kingdom the same year.

In 1926-27 saw the &quot;Geležinis Vilkas&quot; (Iron Wolf) organization was established among right-wing army officers and students. Ostensibly a youth sport organization and registered as such in 1928, Iron Wolf was heavily nationalistic, with a stated purpose of combating the enemies of the state. Their ideology and practices (initiates would kiss an iron dagger as part of their initiation ceremony) were outside the comfort zone of many among the populace and the political elite. Although Smetona was the honorary head of the organization, it was Voldemaras who actively managed it. His personality and oratory skills attracted younger nationalist officers, who were favorably impressed by the emerging fascism, and displeased with what they perceived as Smetona&#x27;s more moderate course. On the other hand, Voldemaras was unpopular with foreign representatives in Lithuania, who perceived him as too radical and arrogant.

===Assassination attempt and fall from power===

Geležinis Vilkas and Voldemaras&#x27;s more radical stance created friction with Smetona. As early as the beginning of 1929, Smetona was preparing to oust Voldemaras from the government. These initial plans were revised by an attempt on Voldemaras&#x27;s life in May.

On 6 May 1929, as Voldemaras, his wife and some friends approached a theater in Kaunas, they were shot at from behind. At least seven shots were fired, killing Voldemaras&#x27;s adjutant and injuring several others. Voldemaras and his wife escaped unharmed, but his nephew was seriously hurt. Three Lithuanian students, members of &quot;Aušrininkai&quot;, were accused of involvement in the assassination attempt, with one of them sentenced and executed. The outpouring of public and international support made it impossible for Smetona to dismiss Voldemaras, but pushed the latter to get even more involved with Geležinis Vilkas.

On 19 September 1929, while attending a meeting of the League of Nations, Voldemaras was ousted by President Smetona after the cabinet resigned. Smetona installed his brother-in-law Juozas Tūbelis as prime minister. In 1930, Voldemaras was exiled to Plateliai and later to Zarasai, where he lived under police surveillance. It was from Zarasai that he was flown into Kaunas during an attempted coup against Smetona in June 1934. Several officers sympathetic to Voldemaras and associated with Geležinis Vilkas attempted to replace Smetona, but the coup did not have widespread support and was unsuccessful. Voldemaras was imprisoned for the next four years, receiving amnesty on condition he leave the country. He chose France as his destination.

==Later life and death==

Voldemaras attempted to return to Lithuania in 1939, but was exiled again. In June 1940, days after the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Lithuania, Voldemaras and his wife tried again to return from exile. He was arrested at the border and imprisoned. It later emerged that he died in Moscow&#x27;s Butyrka prison on 16 December 1942. His place of burial is unknown; a memorial stone for him was unveiled in the Petrašiūnai cemetery in Kaunas in 2012.

==Other activities and personal life==

While in Perm, Voldemaras taught Roman history, Greek, Latin and English at what would become Perm State University. After his stint on the government, he returned to academia in 1920, teaching courses and eventually joining the University of Lithuania (now Vytautas Magnus University) in Kaunas. At the university, he served as a professor and the dean of sociological studies. His academic works were highly acclaimed and in 1923-1924 he participated in international scientific congresses on History and Sociology. A polyglot, Voldemaras was familiar with sixteen different languages and wrote academic works in Lithuanian and French.

In 1919, Voldemaras met Matilda Voldemarienė (née Delahay). While Voldemaras always introduced her as his wife, the status of their relationship was not completely clear and generated some amount of controversy in Lithuania, particularly when the couple visited the Vatican in 1927. Voldemaras&#x27;s political opponents, the Christian Democrats, alleged in Lithuanian press that the couple were living together outside marriage, but the issue was not pressed by the Holy See and the couple received blessings from the Pope. In 1929, the couple acted as the godparents to the three-year-old Valdas Adamkus, who would later become the President of Lithuania. Nevertheless, Voldemaras was considered a womanizer and was known to have had several high-profile affairs during the years.

<text>Brian Reynolds (born 1967) is an American videogame designer. Reynolds has designed at SecretNewCo, Zynga, Big Huge Games, and MicroProse and has been chairman of the International Game Developers Association. He has played a major part in designing a number of multi-million selling games including &quot;Civilization II&quot;, &quot;Rise of Nations&quot;, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;, and &quot;FrontierVille&quot;. He has also founded or co-founded three game companies, SecretNewCo, Big Huge Games, and Firaxis Games.

==Early life and education==
Reynolds made his first game sale with &quot;Quest 1&quot; to &quot;SoftSide&quot; magazine, its August 1981 cover feature. He was a gamer in high school, and a SysOp on Randolph School&#x27;s (Huntsville, Alabama) PDP-11 mainframe computer. A 1990 graduate of the , Reynolds briefly pursued graduate studies in philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Career==
Reynolds initiated his game career with MicroProse where he worked as lead programmer for a number of graphic adventure games. These included &quot;Rex Nebular&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Return of the Phantom&quot; and &quot;Dragonsphere&quot; in 1993.

It was at MicroProse where Reynolds first worked with Sid Meier and the two collaborated on a strategy title by the name of &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Colonization&quot; which was released in 1994. Reynolds went on to become lead designer for a sequel to &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot;. &quot;Civilization II&quot; was released in 1996 and sold multi-million copies.

While at Firaxis, Reynolds contributed to &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Gettysburg&quot; in 1997, followed by the creation and design of &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot; in 1998.

Big Huge Games was acquired by Nexon in 2016.

Although marketed under Sid Meier&#x27;s name, &quot;Civilization II&quot;, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Colonization&quot; and &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot; all credited Reynolds as lead designer. The credits for &quot;Civilization II&quot; only list Meier as the designer of the original &quot;Civilization&quot; game, and Reynolds stated in an interview that for this game Meier &quot;was no longer involved except in name.&quot; The credits for &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot; state that the game was &quot;Created by&quot; Brian Reynolds and Meier is listed with several other team members on the &quot;With&quot; line - in the Designers Notes in the game manual Reynolds also thanks him for all his sage advice.

Brian Reynolds&#x27; first major break was the design of &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization II&quot;. Meier had created &quot;Civilization&quot; but had moved on to other projects. MicroProse wanted to make a sequel and asked Reynolds to design it. MicroProse put Meier on retainer for consultational advice and for the use of his name, but Meier only had peripheral involvement in the design of this game. The sequel game, hence, was primarily designed by Reynolds.

&quot;Rise of Nations&quot; was Reynolds&#x27; first game at Big Huge Games. Later came &quot;Rise of Legends&quot;, a real-time strategy game, published by Microsoft.

Reynolds and Klaus Teuber collaborated to develop the Xbox Live Arcade game &quot;Catan&quot;.

Reynolds led the development of &quot;FrontierVille&quot; and &quot;CityVille 2&quot; for Facebook.

<text>Electronic City is an information technology hub in Bengaluru, India, located in Anekal taluk. Spread over 800 acres (3.2 km²) near Konappana Agrahara and Doddathogur it houses a large number of electronic/IT industrial parks.

Electronic City was established by KEONICS (Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation), and consists of four zones called &quot;phases&quot; – Phase I, Phase II, Phase III and Phase IV. There are approximately 200 IT/ITES company campuses located in Electronic City, including main campuses of Infosys, Wipro, TCS, HCL, Tech Mahindra and Biocon.

==History==
Electronic City was the brainchild of R. K. Baliga, the first Chairman and Managing Director of Keonics, Karnataka Electronic. He dreamt of making Bengaluru the Silicon Valley of India when he developed the concept of Electronic City. In 1978, Keonics established Electronic City on 332 acres of land in Konappana Agrahara and Doddathogur villages. The liberalisation of the Indian economy in the early 1990s by the then Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and then Indian Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh helped Electronic City to become what it is today — the outsourcing capital of the world.

In 1997, the maintenance and upkeep of Electronic City was handed over by Keonics to ELCITA, the Electronic City Township Industries Association, with representatives from units in the enclave, for effective local governance and management. Security is provided by ELCITA, who have deployed around 500 security officials and also installed CCTV cameras on strategic locations. On 18 March 2013, a notification by the Urban Development Department brought Electronic City Phases I, II, III under the E-City Industrial Township Area. Some residential area within Electronic City are still under the governance of City Panchayats and awaiting BBMP inclusion for want of civic amenities.

==Connectivity and transport==
Electronic City has developed infrastructure in terms of connectivity to other important localities of Bangalore city. Electronic City, which was once considered a suburban area, is now considered as part of the city due to the development and connectivity. 

===Road===
BMTC bus services are the most popular mode of transport. There are many BMTC buses starting from Electronic City Bustand (near Hosur Road), Wipro Gate and Infosys Gate ply to all important parts of the city. There are buses from E-City up to KIA. There are frequent BMTC services to Bannerghatta Road, Silk Board, Brigade Road, Attibele, Kengeri, K R Market, KBS etc. Most auto-rickshaws in Electronic City do not charge by the meter and hence an avoidable mode of transport. 

==== Hosur Road ====
Electronic City is on Hosur Road which is a major arterial highway of Bangalore city. Many BMTC buses and interstate buses use this route.

==== Elevated Expressway ====

The four-lane mixed corridor elevated highway from Silk Board junction to Electronic City was opened on 22 January 2010. The 9.985 km long expressway is one of the longest elevated national highways in the country. This elevated stretch helps a commuter reach Electronic City from Silk Board is 30 minutes. The toll price is revised periodically. The expressway has been prone to fatal crashes in its narrow lanes resulting in vehicles falling down from a height, posing high risk to the traffic on the highway below. BTP speed checks are common on this route.

====NICE Road====
The NICE road connects Electronic City to other key areas in the west of Bengaluru city like Bannerghatta Road, Mysore Road, Kanakapura Road and Tumkur Road. This is a 63 km 4-lane access controlled tollway.

===Rail===
==== Metro rail ====
Electronic City comes under the Namma Metro Yellow Line (R V Road - Bommasandra line). The project is near completion.

==== Suburban rail ====
The Heelalige railway station, about 4 km from Electronic City Phase 2, has become part of the Bengaluru Suburban Rail (Bengaluru Commuter Rail) system. The South Western Railways has introduced a fleet of diesel multiple units (DMUs) on this route. The nearest railway stations are Heelalige, which is 6 km from Electronic City, or Karmelaram railway station which is 14 km away.

=== Air ===
====Bengaluru Airport====
KIA is located 56 km away from Electronic City. Travelling time from Electronic City to KIA is 2 hours by road in normal traffic, about 1.5 hours during late nights 12 am to 6 am, and about 3 hours during peak traffic.

====Hosur Airport====
The proposed Hosur Airport in Belagondapalli on Thally Road, an UDAN project, is expected to be nearer to Electronic City. Travelling time: 30 minutes by road. It is 28 km from Electronics City.

====Heli taxis====
Helicopter taxi service to Kempegowda International Airport was launched in March 2018 but stopped during COVID-19 due to operational issues.. The high fare and limited access to helipads make heli-taxis affordable only for industrialists and business travellers.

<doc id="398725" wikidata="Q1043667" url="?curid=398725" title="Sleep debt">
<text>Sleep debt or sleep deficit is the cumulative effect of not getting enough sleep. A large sleep debt may lead to mental or physical fatigue, and can adversely affect one&#x27;s mood, energy, and ability to think clearly.

There are two kinds of sleep debt: the result of partial sleep deprivation, and of total sleep deprivation. Partial sleep deprivation occurs when a person or a lab animal sleeps too little for several days or weeks. Total sleep deprivation, on the other hand, occurs when the subject is kept awake for at least 24 hours. There is debate in the scientific community over the specifics of sleep debt (see ), and it is not considered to be a disorder.

== Physiological effects of sleep debt ==

The effects of chronic sleep debt on the human body&#x27;s metabolic and endocrine processes are significant, particularly for those individuals who are overweight. An analysis of the physiological impacts of sleep debt, published in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, investigated the physiological effects of sleep debt by assessing the sympathovagal balance (an indicator of the sympathetic nervous system activity), thyrotropic function, HPA axis activity, as well as the carbohydrate metabolism of 11 young adult males whose sleep period for six nights was either restricted to four hours per night or extended to 12 hours in bed per night. Results revealed that in the sleep-debt condition, thyrotropin concentrations were decreased, while lowered glucose and insulin responses indicated a clear impairment of carbohydrate tolerance, a 30% decrease than in the well-rested sleep condition. Males who were sleep-restricted also showed significantly elevated concentrations of evening cortisol (the &quot;stress&quot; hormone) and elevated sympathetic nervous system activity in comparison to those who enjoyed a full sleep, throughout 6 nights. Losing so much sleep could lead to many chronic health problems that could include: heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and depression. As stated by the National Institutes of Health, chronic sleep debt has a detrimental impact on human neurophysiological functioning and can disrupt immune, endocrine, and metabolic function, while increasing the severity of cardiovascular and age-related illnesses over a period of time.

== Neuropsychological effects of sleep debt on emotions ==

Accumulated and continuous short-term sleep deficit has been shown to increase and intensify psychophysiological reactions in humans to emotional stimuli. The amygdala plays a strong functional role in the expression of negative emotions such as fear, and, through its anatomical connections with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), has an important function in the subjective suppression of and the reframing and reappraisal of negative emotions. A study assessing sleep deficit in young Japanese men over a 5-day period (during which they slept only 4 hours per day) showed that there was greater left amygdala activation to fearful faces but not happy faces, and an overall subjective mood deterioration. As a result, even short-term continuous sleep debt, or deprivation, has been shown to reduce this functional relationship between the amygdala and mPFC, inducing negative mood changes through increased fear and anxiety to unpleasant emotional stimuli and events. Thus, a full and uninterrupted 7-hour sleep is crucial for the proper functioning of the amygdala in modulating an individual&#x27;s mood states—by reducing negative emotional intensities and increasing reactivity to positive emotional stimuli.

== Sleep debt and obesity ==

Epidemiological research has solidified the association between sleep debt or deprivation and obesity as a result of an elevated body mass index (BMI) through various ways, such as disruptions in the hormones leptin and ghrelin that regulate appetite, higher food consumption and poor diets, and a decrease in overall calorie burning. However, in recent years, multimedia usages such as Internet and television consumption that play an active role in sleep deficit have also been linked to obesity by provoking unhealthy, sedentary lifestyles and habits, as well as higher food consumption. Moreover, work-related behaviors such as long working and commuting hours and irregular work timings such as during shift work also function as contributing factors to being overweight or obese as a result of shorter sleeping periods. In comparison to adults, children exhibit a more consistent association between sleep debt and obesity.

== Sleep debt and mortality ==

Several studies have shown that sleep duration, specifically sleep deficit or shorter sleep duration, predicts mortality, whether it be on weekdays or weekends. In people aged 65 years and younger, daily sleep duration of 5 hours or less (amounting to a sleep deficit of 2 hours per day) during weekends correlated with a 52% higher mortality rate—as compared to a control group who slept for 7 hours. Consistent weekday sleep debt exhibited a detrimental association with mortality and morbidity, but this effect was negated when compensated with long sleep during weekends. However, the harmful consequences of sleep debt over weekdays and weekends were not seen in individuals aged 65 years and older.

==Scientific debate==

There is debate among researchers as to whether the concept of sleep debt describes a measurable phenomenon. The September 2004 issue of the journal &quot;Sleep&quot; contains dueling editorials from two leading sleep researchers, David F. Dinges and Jim Horne. A 1997 experiment conducted by psychiatrists at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine suggested that cumulative nocturnal sleep debt affects daytime sleepiness, particularly on the first, second, sixth, and seventh days of sleep restriction.

In one study, subjects were tested using the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). Different groups of people were tested with different sleep times for two weeks: 8 hours, 6 hours, 4 hours, and total sleep deprivation. Each day, they were tested for the number of lapses on the PVT. The results showed that, as time went by, each group&#x27;s performance worsened, with no sign of any stopping point. Moderate sleep deprivation was found to be detrimental; people who slept 6 hours a night for 10 days had similar results to those who were completely sleep deprived for 1 day.

==Evaluation==

Sleep debt has been tested in a number of studies through the use of a sleep onset latency test. This test attempts to measure how easily a person can fall asleep. When this test is done several times during the day, it is called a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The subject is told to go to sleep and is awakened after determining the amount of time it took to fall asleep. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), an eight-item questionnaire with scores ranging from 0 to 24, is another tool used to screen for potential sleep debt.

A January 2007 study from Washington University in St. Louis suggests that saliva tests of the enzyme amylase could be used to indicate sleep debt, as the enzyme increases its activity in correlation with the length of time a subject has been deprived of sleep.

The control of wakefulness has been found to be strongly influenced by the protein orexin. A 2009 study from Washington University in St. Louis has illuminated important connections between sleep debt, orexin, and amyloid beta, with the suggestion that the development of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease could hypothetically be a result of chronic sleep debt or excessive periods of wakefulness.

==Phosphorylation of proteins==

In mice, there are 80 proteins in the brain, called &quot;sleep need index phosphoproteins&quot; (SNIPPs), which become more and more phosphorylated during waking hours, and are dephosphorylated during sleep. The phosphorylation is aided by the gene Sik3. A type of laboratory mouse (named Sleepy) possesses an altered version of this protein, which is called SLEEPY, where the protein is more active than the regular version. This results in the mice showing more slow-wave sleep activity during non-REM sleep—a reliable indicator that more sleep is met. Inhibition of the Sik3 gene decreases phosphorylation and slow-wave activity in both normal and modified mice.

<text>Samuel Maguire (also , 11 March 1877 – 6 February 1927) was an Irish republican and Gaelic football player. He is chiefly remembered as the eponym of the Sam Maguire Cup, given to the All-Ireland Senior Champions of Gaelic football each year.

==Early life==
He was born in the townland of Mallabraca near the town of Dunmanway in West Cork on 1877 and was a member of the Church of Ireland. He was the son of farmer John Maguire and Jane Kingston.

He had four brothers and two sisters. Willie was the eldest then Mary, Jack, Dick, Paul (who married a Roman Catholic and whose son became a Roman Catholic priest), Sam and Elizabeth. The Maguires farmed of land. However this figure is misleading as only approximately 80 acres were arable land. The translation of the townland Mallabraca is &quot;land of the little hillocks&quot;.

He went to school in the Model School in the local town Dunmanway and then to the national school in Ardfield. This school run by Master Madden specialised in preparing its pupils for the UK Civil Service and Post Office examinations. Madden was part of a long tradition of Irish nationalism and he had a field next to the school where pupils could play Gaelic football.

The school was very successful and became known as the &quot;University of the Mountains&quot; because the place name Ardfield can be literally translated as the &quot;place on the high ground&quot;. At the age of 20, Maguire passed the exams for the UK Post Office.

==Professional life==
He then took a job in the British Civil Service in London. Maguire joined and captained the successful London Hibernians Gaelic football team to several All-Ireland finals between 1900 and 1904.

In 1907 he went into the administration of the London GAA, becoming the Chairman of the London County Board and a regular delegate to the Annual Congress of the GAA. He later became a trustee of Croke Park. Coincidentally, Vice-Chairman of the London County Board was Liam MacCarthy who gave his name to the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship trophy, the Liam MacCarthy Cup.

He is also remembered in the political sphere for recruiting the nationalist leader Michael Collins to the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1909 and for many years was one of Collins&#x27;s right hand men. As Collins&#x27;s chief intelligence officer in London, Maguire became the centre of Scotland Yard&#x27;s investigation into the assassination of Sir Henry Wilson. Maguire was tipped off and fled to Dublin in December 1923 where he got a job in the newly established Irish civil service. Because of his political opinions and his sympathies to the Anti-Treaty forces, he quickly clashed with his superiors and was dismissed.

==Death==
Cork-based Margaret Walsh, who has written &quot;Sam Maguire: The Enigmatic Man Behind Ireland&#x27;s Most Prestigious Trophy&quot;, says that &quot;what became of him was very sad&quot;. &quot;In 1924, he was sacked and deprived of his pension.&quot; They (the Irish Government) gave him £100 and that was it. &quot;In 1925, he came back to west Cork to live. He then developed TB and died in penury in 1927 aged 49. They say that he died of a broken heart and penniless.&quot;

He is buried in the cemetery of Saint Mary&#x27;s in Dunmanway. A Celtic cross was raised over his grave with a simple inscription

&quot;Erected to the memory of Samuel Maguire, Mallabraca who died 6th February 1927 by the people of Dunmanway and his numerous friends throughout Ireland and England in recognition of his love for his country.&quot;
Dunmanway&#x27;s Dohenys GAA club named their home pitch Sam Maguire Park in his honour, and the club&#x27;s under-age teams joined with the Randal Og Club compete under the moniker &quot;Sam Maguires&quot;.
On 15 September 2002, a statue of Sam Maguire was unveiled as the centrepiece of a new €500,000 plaza in Dunmanway&#x27;s town centre.

In 2017, the community of Dunmanway paid for a new set of eight bells (the &#x27;Sam Maguire Community bells&#x27;) which are installed in St. Mary&#x27;s Church. The two lightest bells were cast in 2017 and have &#x27;Sam Maguire 1877-1927&#x27; inscribed on them, while the back six bells were cast in 1887 by John Warner, and were formerly hung in the now-closed Christ Church, Llanelli, Wales.

==Sam Maguire Cup==
The Sam Maguire Cup was designed and presented to the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1928 in his honour after his death in 1927. The cup cost £300 in 1928 (equivalent to £13,176 in 2021). After it had been commissioned by the committee under the chairmanship of Dr Pat McCartan, the task of making the cup was given to Hopkins and Hopkins, a jewellers and watchmakers, of O&#x27;Connell Bridge, Dublin.

The cups design is modelled closely on the Ardagh chalice.

The silver cup was crafted, on behalf of Hopkins and Hopkins, by the silversmith Matthew J. Staunton of D&#x27;Olier Street, Dublin.

Kildare was the first county to win the Sam Maguire Cup after defeating Cavan 2–6 to 2–5 in 1928. The cup was replaced in 1988, Meath being the first recipient of &quot;Sam Óg&quot; after a defeat of Cork.

<doc id="398730" wikidata="Q966050" url="?curid=398730" title="Charles Bernstein (poet)">
<text>Charles Bernstein (born April 4, 1950) is an American poet, essayist, editor, and literary scholar. Bernstein is the Donald T. Regan Professor, Emeritus, Department of English at the University of Pennsylvania. He is one of the most prominent members of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E or Language poets. In 2006, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. and in 2019 he was awarded the Bollingen Prize from Yale University, the premiere American prize for lifetime achievement, given on the occasion of the publication of &quot;Near/Miss&quot;.

From 1990 to 2003, Bernstein was David Gray Professor of Poetry and Poetics at SUNY-Buffalo, where he co-founded the Poetics Program. A volume of Bernstein&#x27;s selected poetry from the past thirty years, &quot;All the Whiskey in Heaven&quot;, was published in 2010 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux. &quot;The Salt Companion to Charles Bernstein&quot; was published in 2012 by Salt Publishing and &quot;Charles Bernstein: The Poetry of Idiomatic Insistences&quot;, edited by Paul Bovê was published by Duke University Press and &quot;boundary 2&quot; in 2021.

==Early life and work==
Bernstein was born in Manhattan, New York, to a Jewish family and attended the Bronx High School of Science, graduating in 1968. His mother was Sherry Bernstein (born Shirley Jacqueline Kegel, February 2, 1921, to October 27, 2018) and his father was Herman Bernstein (1901–1977). Charles then matriculated at Harvard College, where he majored in philosophy and studied the work of J. L. Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein under Stanley Cavell, a seminal figure in ordinary language philosophy, as well as Rogers Albritton. Cavell would oversee Bernstein&#x27;s thesis, a study that pursued the aesthetic and poetic possibilities of the amalgamation of analytical philosophy and avant-garde literature, focussing on Gertrude Stein and Wittgenstein.

After Bernstein graduated from Harvard in 1972, his first book, &quot;Asylums&quot;, was published in 1975. Together with Bruce Andrews, he edited the magazine &quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E&quot;, which ran to 13 issues (three volumes) between 1978 and 1981 (plus three supplements and a fourth volume in 1981. This is routinely considered to be the starting point of Language Poetry and was the most significant outlet for both the progressive poetry and progressive poetic theory taking place in New York City and Berkeley. He has said about the creation of &quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E&quot;: &quot;We tried to trace a history of radical poetics, taking up the model presented in Jerome Rothenberg&#x27;s &quot;Revolution of the Word&quot;, and later by Rothenberg and Pierre Joris in &quot;Poems for the Millennium&quot; and Marjorie Perloff in &quot;The Futurist Moment&quot;. When you go back 30 years, you see that poetics that now are widely accepted as foundational for contemporary poetry were harshly rejected then.&quot; Bernstein and Andrews published selected pieces from these 13 issues in &quot;The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book&quot;. In 2019 and 2020, the University of New Mexico Press, under editors Matthew Hofer and Michael Golston, published three related books: &quot;The Language Letters: Selected 1970s Correspondence of Bruce Andrews, Ron Silliman, and Charles Bernstein;&quot; a new edition of &quot;Legend by&quot; Andrews, Bernstein, Ray DiPalma, Steve McCaffery, and Ron Silliman; and &quot;L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E: Facsimile Edition.&quot;

During this period, Bernstein also published three more books of his own poetry, &quot;Parsing&quot; (1976), &quot;Shade&quot; (1978) and &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; (1979), earning a living working for the Cultural Council Foundation&#x27;s CETA Artist Project and as a freelance medical writer. He also co-founded the Ear Inn reading series with Ted Greenwald in 1978.

==Later life and work==

From 1989 to 2003, Bernstein was David Gray Professor of Poetry and Letters at the University at Buffalo, where he was a SUNY Distinguished Professor and co-founder and Director of the Poetics Program. He is also, with Loss Pequeño Glazier, co-founder of The Electronic Poetry Center at Buffalo. From 2003 to 2019, he was Donald T. Regan Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Pennsylvania, where he co-founded the poetry audio archive PennSound. He has been the recipient of fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation (1985), the New York Foundation for the Arts (1990 and 1995),the National Endowment for the Arts (1980), and of the 1999 Roy Harvey Pearce/Archive for New Poetry Prize of the University of California, San Diego, and the 2025 America Award for Lifetime Contribution to American Writing. With his translators, Bernstein won the 2015 Münster Prize for International Poetry for two German translations. In the same year, he won the Janus Pannonius Grand Prize for Poetry. In 2019, Bernstein was the recipient of the Bollingen Prize for American poetry, for lifetime achievement and for &quot;Near/Miss&quot;. Bernstein was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.

Since 1980, he has published a further eighteen books of poetry, as well as editing a number of anthologies of prose and verse, including &quot;The Politics of Poetic Form,&quot; &quot;Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word,&quot; &quot;S/N: NewWorldPoetics&quot;, with Eduard Espina, and &quot;Best American Experimental Writing&quot;, with Tracie Morris. Working with the composers Ben Yarmolinsky, Dean Drummond, and Brian Ferneyhough, he has written the libretti for five operas and has collaborated with a number of visual artists, including his wife, Susan Bee, Richard Tuttle, Amy Sillman, and Mimi Gross. In 1984, he organized&quot;New York Talk&quot; and in 1985–86, &quot;St Marks Talks,&quot; the first lecture series at the Poetry Project in New York. In 2001, he co-curated &quot;Poetry Plastique&quot; with Jay Sanders. Bernstein&#x27;s work has appeared frequently in The Best American Poetry series, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Poetry Magazine&quot;, &quot;boundary 2,&quot; and &quot;Critical Inquiry.&quot; While Bernstein has supported small presses throughout his career, he has also published on such mainstream academic presses as Oxford University Press, Harvard University Press, Northwestern University Press, and, most recently, The University of Chicago Press, which has published his last major works. The publication of &quot;All the Whiskey in Heaven&quot; by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux in 2010 was his most commercial endeavor to date. He has said about his work, &quot;It&#x27;s true that, on the one hand, I mock and destabilize the foundation of a commitment to lyric poetry as an address toward truth or toward sincerity. But, on the other hand, if you&#x27;re interested in theory as a stable expository mode of knowledge production or critique moving toward truth, again, I should be banned from your republic. (I&#x27;ve already been banned from mine.) My vacillating poetics of poems and essays is a serial practice, a play of voices.&quot;

There have been three collections of essays focussed on Bernstein&#x27;s work: a 1985 issue of &quot;The Difficulties&quot;, ed. Tom Beckett, &quot;The Salt Companion to Charles Bernstein,&quot; ed. William Allegrezza (2012), and &quot;Charles Bernstein: The Poetry of Idiomatic Insistences&quot;, ed. Paul Bovē, a special issue of &quot;boundary 2&quot; (2021). Hundreds of individual essays, chapters, and reviews are listed and often linked at the Electronic Poetry Center.

He appeared in the 2000 movie &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; as Dr. Simon and in a series of 1999 TV commercials with Jon Lovitz for the Yellow Pages.

In 2020, Bernstein published a poetry collection, with artist Davide Balula, titled &quot;Poetry Has No Future Unless It Comes to an End: Poems of Artificial Intelligence&quot;. The poems were generated by an artificial intelligence model trained on Bernstein&#x27;s own body of work, creating outputs that the poet edited, omitting select poems and verses without adding new language. Bernstein said, &quot;this project demanded more work – mine and Davide&#x27;s – than if I had written the poems alone.&quot; He highlighted that the project predated tools like ChatGPT.

==Personal life==
Charles Bernstein is married to artist Susan Bee. They have had two children, Emma Bee Bernstein (May 16, 1985 – December 20, 2008) and Felix Bernstein (born May 20, 1992).

==Reception==
Jerome Rothenberg has called Bernstein “A major poet for our time — &amp; then some. He has emerged as a principal voice –maybe the best we have – for an international avant-garde now in its second century of visions &amp; revisions.&quot;

Robert Creeley has written: &quot;Bernstein’s is the most provocatively intelligent reaction to the general drift of mainstream poetry, and he is an indefatigable writer of essays and poems wherein the determinations of genre are largely superseded. In short, he has not only given brilliant instance of the confusions of contemporary social and political premises but has done so in remarkable constructs of their characteristic modes of statement, which are not simply parodic but rather reclamations, recyclings, of otherwise degraded material.&quot;

According to Marjorie Perloff: “Charles Bernstein is our ultimate connoisseur of chaos, the chronicler, in poems of devastating satire, chilling and complex irony, exuberant wit, and, above all, profound passion, of the contradictions and absurdities of everyday life in urban America at the turn of the twenty-first century. From such early underground classics as “The Klupzy Girl,” to the mordant verbal play of “The Lives of the Toll Takers,” to the great meditation on 9/11 called “Report from Liberty Street” and the deeply personal ballads and elegies of recent years, Bernstein’s much awaited Selected Poems displays a formal range, performative urgency, and verbal dexterity unmatched by other poets of his generation.”

Claudia Rankine, Evie Shockley, and Ange Mlinko, in the Bollingen Prize citation: &quot;As poet, editor, critic, translator, and educator, Charles Bernstein&#x27;s decades-long commitment to the community of arts and letters reflects a profound understanding of the importance of language in the business of culture-making. His extraordinary new collection of poems, &quot;Near/Miss&quot;, finds Bernstein deploying his characteristically incisive satire and sharp wit to dismantle the clichés driving public speech. Yet, in moments treading close to heartbreak, the work sounds the depths where the public poet must find the words for private grief. Bernstein’s work interrogates, restlessly, seemingly word by word, language and its performative nature. Throughout his career Bernstein has facilitated a vibrant dialogue between lyric and anti-lyric tendencies in the poetic traditions we have inherited; in so doing, he has shaped and questioned, defined and dismantled ideas and assumptions in order to reveal poetry’s widest and most profound capabilities.

<text>Harlon Junius Hill (May 4, 1932 – March 21, 2013) 
was an American professional football end who played for nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Hill played for the Chicago Bears, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Detroit Lions. He was the NFL Rookie of the Year in 1954 and winner of the Jim Thorpe Trophy as the NFL Most Valuable Player in 1955. The Harlon Hill Trophy, named in his honor, is awarded annually to the nation&#x27;s best NCAA Division II football player. After his playing career, he became a coach and educator.

==Early life and college==
Hill was born in Killen, Alabama. Following graduation from Lauderdale County High School in nearby Rogersville in 1949, he attended Florence State Teachers College, now known as the University of North Alabama. Football was just making its return to Florence State in 1949 after several years absence due to low male enrollment. Hill was a four-year letterman on the football team, while also earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Education.

He played both offense and defense, but it was his offensive efforts that saw him named an NAIA All-American player his senior year in 1953. As with many college teams of the era, Florence State was a run-based offense and threw the ball sparingly. However, Hill made the most of his chances with 19 of his 54 career catches going for touchdowns.

In his 1977 biography &quot;Victory after the Game&quot;, Hill related his surprise at being selected in the 15th round of the 1954 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, remaining unaware of it until approached with the news by a Florence State professor on campus: &#x27;&quot;I had no idea I had been `discovered.&#x27; I really did not know much about the National Football League...I did not know what to think, but after I found out what it was all about, naturally I was elated.&quot; Hill went on to say he owed the discovery to a rival school. A coach for Jacksonville State University had observed Hill&#x27;s play over four seasons and mentioned him to a Bears scout.

==Professional career==
Hill&#x27;s rookie season with the Chicago Bears was a memorable one. He set a team record for most receiving yards (1,124) and most touchdown receptions (12) by a rookie. The twelve touchdowns led all NFL receivers that season as he averaged 25 yards per catch on 45 total receptions, the latter of which was a Bears record for a rookie until it was broken by Darnell Mooney in 2020. His best performance that rookie year came on October 31, 1954, against the San Francisco 49ers. Hill was a Halloween nightmare for the 49ers defense, racking up 214 receiving yards and four touchdowns, the final one coming with thirty seconds left in the game to give the Bears a four-point victory. Numerous accolades came Hill&#x27;s way following that season, among them being named 1954 NFL Rookie of the Year, being an All-Pro selection, and participating in the 1954 Pro Bowl.

Hill&#x27;s performance numbers were down somewhat the next season, 1955, with 789 yards on 42 receptions. However, his nine touchdown catches again led the league, and he was once again selected All-Pro and Pro-Bowl participant. Fellow players voted him the first inaugural winner of the Jim Thorpe Trophy as league&#x27;s most valuable player. 1956 would prove to be Hill&#x27;s career best statistically with 47 catches, 1,128 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns as the Bears advanced to the NFL Championship Game against the New York Giants. Hill and the Bears were beaten soundly, 47–7, on a very icy Yankee Stadium field. After the season Hill was voted a first-team All-NFL player by numerous media including the Associated Press, United Press, and the &quot;Sporting News&quot;. He was chosen Captain of the Western Conference squad for the 1956 Pro Bowl game, which lost in a close affair, 31–30.

Injuries began to take their toll on Hill&#x27;s NFL career in the late 1950s, the most serious one being a completely severed Achilles tendon in 1958. According to Hill, he was the first professional athlete to recover from the surgical repair and continue his career. The injury robbed him of much of his speed however and his offensive numbers steadily declined, with his last touchdown reception coming in the 1959 season. By 1961, his final year as a Bear, he managed only three catches for 51 yards on the season. Hill attempted to play again in the 1962 season, splitting time between the Steelers and Lions and accumulating 101 receiving yards on 14 catches. He retired from football at the conclusion of the 1962 season. Hill still holds several franchise records with the Bears and ranks among the best in others. His nineteen games with 100 or more receiving yards are still a record as are his 1,124 rookie receiving yards and 12 rookie touchdown catches. The four touchdown receptions in one game (San Francisco, 1954) are tied with Mike Ditka for team lead all-time. His career 4,616 receiving yards and 40 career touchdown receptions (32 of them coming in a 3-year span from 1954 through 1956) rank him second best all-time for Chicago.

The Professional Football Researchers Association named Hill to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2014.

==Life after the NFL==
Hill returned to his native Alabama when his playing days were finished. He fought a successful battle against alcoholism and returned to his alma mater (then known as Florence State Teachers College), serving as an assistant football coach for the University of North Alabama in the late 1960s while also working toward a Master&#x27;s degree in Education. After earning his Master&#x27;s in 1969 he became a public school teacher and coach at Brooks High School, eventually becoming the school&#x27;s principal. In 1986 a new award was created to highlight America&#x27;s best NCAA Division II players, named the Harlon Hill Trophy in honor of his playing career. Often considered the Division II equivalent of the Heisman Trophy, it is awarded annually during the NCAA Division II Football Championship weekend in Florence, Alabama. Hill retired from the Lauderdale County, Alabama, school system and resided in Alabama until his death. Hill died March 21, 2013, at Eliza Coffee Memorial Hospital in Florence, Alabama, following a prolonged illness.

<doc id="398735" wikidata="Q507727" url="?curid=398735" title="Echoes (Pink Floyd song)">
<text>&quot;Echoes&quot; is a song by the English rock band Pink Floyd, and the sixth and last track on their 1971 album &quot;Meddle&quot;. It is minutes long, the second longest of their discography, fourteen seconds shorter than &quot;Atom Heart Mother Suite&quot;, and takes up the entire second side of the original LP. The track evolved from a variety of different musical themes and ideas, including instrumental passages and studio effects, resulting in the side-long piece. The music, credited to all the band, was mainly written by Richard Wright and David Gilmour, while Roger Waters&#x27; lyrics addressed themes of human communication and empathy, to which he returned in later work.

The song was performed live regularly by Pink Floyd from 1971 to 1975, including a performance in the film &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot; (1972). It was used for the opening shows on the 1987 A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour but subsequently dropped. David Gilmour revived &quot;Echoes&quot; for his 2006 On an Island Tour, which featured Richard Wright, but retired the piece after Wright&#x27;s death in 2008. However, Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets has since played the song as part of its Echoes Tour. The studio recording was used in the film &quot;Crystal Voyager&quot; (1973) while an edited version is included on the greatest-hits album &quot;&quot; (2001).

&quot;Echoes&quot; has been regarded by critics as an important song that transitions between Pink Floyd&#x27;s early experimental material as a cult band and later mainstream success. Several publications have remarked it as one of the best songs by the group. The group have mixed views of the track, but it was a particular favourite of Wright&#x27;s.

== Structure ==

&quot;Echoes&quot; begins with a &quot;ping&quot; that was created as a result of an experiment very early in the &quot;Meddle&quot; sessions, produced by amplifying a grand piano played by Richard Wright and sending the signal through a Leslie speaker and a Binson Echorec unit. After several &quot;pings&quot;, a slide guitar played by David Gilmour gradually joins in. The verses are sung in harmony by Gilmour and Wright, and joined by a riff played by Gilmour and bassist Roger Waters in unison. This is followed by a guitar solo from Gilmour, played on a Fender Stratocaster through a Fuzz Face effects box, before repeating the previous riff. This leads into a funk-influenced jam.

The middle section of the song features Waters using a slide and a Binson Echorec. Gilmour plays a high-pitched screeching noise, which was created by plugging a wah-wah pedal in back to front (the guitar was plugged into the output of the pedal, and the input of the pedal was plugged into the input of the amplifier). Drummer Nick Mason later clarified that it was an accident, and their experience with working with Ron Geesin had taught them to embrace experiments and try anything if it would work on a song. This is followed by a repeat of the opening piano &quot;pings&quot; and a Farfisa organ solo from Wright, said to have been influenced by the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1967).

Following a final third verse, the end of the piece features a choral-sounding segment playing a Shepard tone. This was created by placing two tape recorders in opposite corners of a room; the main chord tapes of the song were then fed into one recorder and played back while at the same time recording. The other recorder was then also set to play what was being recorded; this created a delay between both recordings, influencing the chordal structure.

== Composition ==
&quot;Echoes&quot; began as a collection of separate musical experiments, some of which were left over from previous sessions. Pink Floyd then arranged the pieces in order to make a coherent piece originally referred to as &quot;Nothing, Parts 1–24&quot;. Some pieces featured band members playing a recording without any idea what the rest of the group had or were going to play, while others simply had vague notes such as &quot;first two minutes romantic, next two up-tempo&quot;. Not all of the pieces were used for the finished track, and out-takes included saying a phrase backwards, so it would sound correct yet strange when the tape was reversed. Subsequent tapes of work in progress were labelled &quot;The Son of Nothing&quot; and &quot;The Return of the Son of Nothing&quot;; the latter title was eventually used to introduce the as-yet-unreleased work in its first live performances in early 1971.

Wright said he composed the piano intro and the main chord progression of the song, and that Waters wrote the lyrics. During early development, before the first verse was finalised, it referred to the meeting of two celestial bodies. For the final lyrics, Waters took inspiration from his time in London in the mid to late 1960s, feeling a sense of disconnection and looking for the potential for humans to connect with each other. One particular observation was looking from his flat on Goldhawk Road and watching a procession of commuters walk past, which led to &quot;Strangers passing in the street&quot;. &quot;Echoes&quot; established a trend with Waters to write emphatic words and explore the theme of communication, which would be a key theme of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973) and later solo work.

Pink Floyd rehearsed the completed piece before committing a final version to tape. Studio recording was split between Abbey Road Studios, Morgan Studios and AIR Studios in London; the latter two were used because they had a 16-track recorder, which made assembling the individual components of the songs easier. The basic backing tracks were recorded between 7 and 19 March at Abbey Road, with the further overdubs recorded at AIR from 30 March to 1 May, with additional work at Morgan. Pink Floyd were featured on an episode of the BBC1 programme &quot;24 Hours&quot; discussing bootleg recordings, which showed them rehearsing &quot;Echoes&quot; at Abbey Road.

Waters accused Andrew Lloyd Webber of plagiarising a prominent instrumental from &quot;Echoes&quot; for the main theme in the 1986 musical &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. However he decided against filing a lawsuit. Instead, he dissed Lloyd Webber in &quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot; on his 1992 solo album &quot;Amused to Death&quot;.

== Live performances ==
Pink Floyd first performed &quot;Echoes&quot; at Norwich Lads Club on 22 April 1971, and it was a regular part of the band&#x27;s set, up to the concert at Knebworth Park on 5 July 1975. It was originally announced by its working title, &quot;Return of the Son of Nothing&quot; and not formally identified as &quot;Echoes&quot; until the group&#x27;s tour of Japan, starting on 6 August 1971. Occasionally, Waters would introduce the song with silly titles, such as &quot;Looking Through the Knotholes in Granny&#x27;s Wooden Leg&quot;, &quot;We Won The Double&quot; (a reference to Arsenal F.C. winning the double in the 1970–71 season), and &quot;March of the Dambusters&quot;.

The song was played at a BBC Radio 1 concert on 30 September 1971 and broadcast on 12 October. Shortly afterwards, Pink Floyd filmed a live performance at the Amphitheatre of Pompeii with no audience for &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot;, where it was split in two halves to open and close the film. &quot;Echoes&quot; was one of four pieces that Pink Floyd played in collaboration with a ballet choreographed by Roland Petit in late 1972 and early 1973. The track featured a solo ballet piece for Rudy Bryans of the Ballets de Marseille. For the group&#x27;s 1973 shows at Earl&#x27;s Court, the performance of &quot;Echoes&quot; featured large quantities of dry ice being poured onto the stage during the middle section, and sheets of flame shooting from a cauldron at the back of the stage.

From late 1974 to the Knebworth concert, &quot;Echoes&quot; was performed as an encore. These performances featured backing vocals by Venetta Fields and Carlena Williams and saxophone solos by Dick Parry instead of the guitar solos in earlier performances. &quot;Echoes&quot; was performed for the first eleven shows on the band&#x27;s 1987 A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, in a slightly rearranged version trimmed down to 17 minutes. However, Gilmour was uncomfortable about singing the &quot;hippy&quot; lyrics, and the touring musicians found it difficult to replicate the sound of the studio original, so it was replaced with &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;.

Gilmour resurrected the song on his 2006 On an Island Tour as the closing number of the main set, with Wright performing in his band. Wright said he still liked playing the song live and was amazed by the audience response to the opening &quot;ping&quot; when on tour. These performances appear on Gilmour&#x27;s &quot;Remember That Night&quot; film and &quot;Live in Gdańsk&quot; album/film. A special acoustic version, featuring just Gilmour and Wright and filmed live at Abbey Road, featured as a hidden track on &quot;Remember That Night&quot;. Gilmour told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2016 upon returning to Pompeii to play a solo show that he would have loved to perform &quot;Echoes&quot; but felt he could not do so without Wright, who had died in 2008 – &quot;There&#x27;s something that&#x27;s specifically so individual about the way that Rick and I play in that, that you can&#x27;t get someone to learn it and do it just like that.&quot; Similarly, Mason initially did not play &quot;Echoes&quot; live with Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets as he felt the track is too strongly identified with Wright, but included the song for the 2022 tour named &quot;The Echoes Tour&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Echoes&quot; occupied the whole of the second side of the album &quot;Meddle&quot;, released on 30 October 1971. Mason later said this might have been because the group wanted to put more suitable material for radio on side one. An edited version of the song appeared on the 2001 compilation &quot;&quot;, and as part of an 8-track promotional sampler.

The live performance at Pompeii was released to cinemas in September 1972. It was first released on video in 1983, then on DVD in 2003. Several works-in-progress pieces and live performances were released on the 2016 box set &quot;The Early Years 1965–1972&quot;.

== Reception ==
In a review for the &quot;Meddle&quot; album, Jean-Charles Costa of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Echoes&quot; a positive review. Costa described &quot;Echoes&quot; as &quot;a 23-minute Pink Floyd aural extravaganza that takes up all of side two, recaptures, within a new musical framework, some of the old themes and melody lines from earlier albums&quot;, adding: &quot;All of this plus a funky organ-bass-drums segment and a stunning Gilmour solo adds up to a fine extended electronic outing.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; covered Pink Floyd&#x27;s opening date on their 1972 Dark Side of the Moon Tour at the Brighton Dome and called &quot;Echoes&quot; a highlight of the set, saying that it was &quot;masterful&quot;. Reviewing the 1975 Knebworth concert, &quot;Sounds&quot; said that despite a mixed performance in the main set, &quot;Echoes&quot; was &quot;pretty superb&quot; and &quot;played flawlessly&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that Gilmour&#x27;s live performance of the piece in Gdańsk at the end of the On an Island Tour in 2006 was &quot;jaw-dropping&quot;. Touring guitarist Phil Manzanera said &quot;that version of &#x27;Echoes&#x27; was the longest one and the best one. Life is funny. It&#x27;s cosmic. It&#x27;s like Richard knew something was up, and he stayed on longer. It&#x27;s a magical song.&quot;

Mike Cormack said that &quot;If Pink Floyd had done nothing after &quot;Meddle&quot;, &quot;Echoes&quot; would have assured them of a place in rock’s highest echelon&quot;, and that the song &quot;is the single greatest long-form track in rock music, with a grandeur, scale and imagination that leaves everyone else for dead.&quot; Author Ed Macan has called &quot;Echoes&quot; Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot; and an important bridge between the group as a cult band and later mainstream success. Andy Cush has said that the track is a transition between the group&#x27;s experimental material and later commercial success, emphasising that it is &quot;ambitious beyond anything Pink Floyd had attempted before, wild beyond anything they’d attempt after&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Echoes&quot; number 30 in a list of Pink Floyd&#x27;s 30 best songs, while in 2011, readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it as the fifth-best song by Pink Floyd.

The members of Pink Floyd have mixed views on the track. Wright said that the piece was &quot;a highlight&quot; and &quot;one of the finest tracks the Floyd have ever done&quot;. Waters and Gilmour have said that it was a foretaste of things to come in &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, while Mason has said that it was &quot;a bit overlong&quot;.

== Film ==
The 1973 George Greenough film &quot;Crystal Voyager&quot; concludes with a 23-minute segment in which the full version of &quot;Echoes&quot; accompanies a montage of images shot by Greenough from a camera mounted on his back while surfing on his kneeboard. The group allowed Greenough and director David Elfick to use the music in their film in exchange for the use of Greenough&#x27;s footage as a visual background when they performed &quot;Echoes&quot; in concert. In the early 1990s, this footage was planned to be used in an advertisement for toilet cleaner, but it did not get clearance from the band.

Similar to the Dark Side of the Rainbow effect, fans have suggested that &quot;Echoes&quot; coincidentally synchronises with Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, when played concurrently with the final 23-minute segment titled &quot;Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite&quot;. Kubrick would later feature copies of both the soundtrack to &quot;2001&quot; and Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; (1970) as props in the record store scene in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971).

== Cover versions ==
Alien Sex Fiend covered the track for a Pink Floyd tribute album &quot;A Saucerful of Pink&quot;, released in July 1995. British musician Ewan Cunningham covered &quot;Echoes&quot; in 2017 and uploaded a YouTube video that featured him playing all of the parts himself. This cover was heavily based on the &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot; version and went on to receive praise from Mason, who humorously said: &quot;Looks like we&#x27;re all out of a job!&quot;

The acoustic guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela covered &quot;Echoes&quot; on their 2019 album &quot;Mettavolution&quot;, one of seven tracks which won the album an award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020. In reviewing this cover version, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;like the original, the song is its own journey, and it&#x27;s beautiful&quot;.

<doc id="398738" wikidata="Q980277" url="?curid=398738" title="William C. Dement">
<text>William Charles Dement (July 29, 1928 – June 17, 2020) was an American sleep researcher and founder of the Sleep Research Center at Stanford University. He was a leading authority on sleep, sleep deprivation and the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and narcolepsy. For this pioneering work in a previously uncharted field in the United States, he is sometimes referred to as the American father of sleep medicine.

==Biography==
Dement was born in Wenatchee, Washington, in 1928. In the 1950s, of those who also studied at the University of Chicago he was the first to intensively study the connection between rapid eye movement and dreaming. His fellow student Eugene Aserinsky had mentioned to him that &quot;Dr. Kleitman and I think these eye movements might be related to dreaming&quot;. Aserinsky, along with his and Dement&#x27;s adviser Nathaniel Kleitman, had previously noticed the connection but hadn&#x27;t considered it very interesting. Dement had an interest in psychiatry, which in those days considered dreams to be important, so he was excited by the discovery and was eager to pursue it. From the University of Chicago, he received an MD in 1955 and a PhD in neurophysiology in 1957 for the thesis &quot;Rapid eye movements during sleep in schizophrenics and non-schizophrenics and their relation to dream recall&quot; supervised by Kleitman.

He began his work in sleep deprivation at Mount Sinai Hospital in the late 1950s – the early 1960s. In 1964, he monitored and assisted Randy Gardner&#x27;s successful attempt to break the record for longest time without sleep. He was among the first researchers to study sleeping subjects with the electroencephalogram (EEG), and he wrote &quot;I believe that the study of sleep became a true scientific field in 1953, when I finally was able to make all-night, continuous recordings of brain and eye activity during sleep.&quot; Studying these recordings, he discovered and named the five stages of sleep. In collaboration with Dr. Christian Guilleminault, Dement proposed the measure that is still used for the clinical definition of sleep apnea and the rating of its severity, the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI).

Dement, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine, taught the large and popular &quot;Sleep and Dreams&quot; course at Stanford, which started in 1971.

In 1975 he launched the American Sleep Disorders Association, now known as the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and served as president for its first twelve years. In that same year he and Mary Carskadon invented the Multiple Sleep Latency Test used to measure sleepiness, a test of how quickly people fall asleep, sleep onset latency, during several daytime opportunities. He later was inducted to the Hall of Fame of the American Sleep and Breathing Academy (ASBA) , and he gave his last conference lecture to healthcare professionals at the 2016 Annual Session of ASBA.

He was also chairman of the National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research, whose final report led directly to the creation of a new agency within the National Institutes of Health, the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research.

Dement was the author of &quot;The Promise of Sleep&quot; and &quot;The Sleepwatchers&quot;, and wrote the first undergraduate textbook in the field. &quot;The Promise of Sleep&quot; was featured in the 2012 independent comedy film Sleepwalk with Me, and Dement also made a cameo appearance in the film.

At the start of his academic career, he was a jazz musician and played bass. While at the University of Washington, he played with Quincy Jones, a time during which he also befriended Ray Charles. During the late 1980s, while at Stanford, he was known to have played, on at least one occasion, with artist-in-residence, Stan Getz.

He lived with his family in northern California. Dement died in Stanford, California, on June 17, 2020, from cardiovascular disease at the age of 91.

<text>Samuel William Smith (August 23, 1852 – June 19, 1931), was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan.

He was born in Independence Township and attended the common schools in Clarkston and Detroit. He began teaching school in 1869, served as superintendent of schools in Waterford Township in 1875 and also served as principal of the school at Waterford, Michigan. He went on to study law, was admitted to the bar in 1877 and graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1878. He began legal practice in Pontiac, where for six months he worked alone with considerable success, and then formed a partnership with Levi Taft Aaron Perry. Perry retired from the firm during the second year of the partnership, but the connection between Taft and Smith continued until the death of the former in 1897. Smith was prosecuting attorney of Oakland County from 1880 to 1884.

He served in the Michigan Senate from 1885 to 1887, representing the 15th District. He was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 6th congressional district to the 55th United States Congress and to the eight succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1897, to March 3, 1915. During his tenure, Smith was chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia in the 60th and 61st Congresses. He did not stand for reelection to the 64th Congress, but moved to Detroit in 1913 and continued the practice of law. He died in Detroit and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Adrian, Michigan.

<doc id="398743" wikidata="Q472639" url="?curid=398743" title="William Jackson Hooker">
<text>Sir William Jackson Hooker (6 July 178512 August 1865) was an English botanist and botanical illustrator, who became the first director of Kew when in 1841 it was recommended to be placed under state ownership as a botanic garden. At Kew he founded the Herbarium and enlarged the gardens and arboretum. 

Hooker was born and educated in Norwich. An inheritance gave him the means to travel and to devote himself to the study of natural history, particularly botany. He published his account of an expedition to Iceland in 1809, even though his notes and specimens were destroyed during his voyage home. He married Maria, the eldest daughter of the Norfolk banker Dawson Turner, in 1815, afterwards living in Halesworth for 11 years, where he established a herbarium that became renowned by botanists at the time.

He held the post of Regius Professor of Botany at Glasgow University, where he worked with the botanist and lithographer Thomas Hopkirk and enjoyed the supportive friendship of Joseph Banks for his exploring, collecting and organising work. in 1841 he succeeded William Townsend Aiton as Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. He expanded the gardens at Kew, building new glasshouses, and establishing an arboretum and a museum of economic botany. Among his publications are &quot;The British Jungermanniae&quot; (1816), &quot;Flora Scotica&quot; (1821), and &quot;Species Filicum&quot; (184664).

He died in 1865 from complications due to a throat infection, and was buried at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew. His son, Joseph Dalton Hooker, succeeded him as Director of Kew Gardens.

==Family==
Hooker&#x27;s father Joseph Hooker was related to the Baring family and worked for them in Exeter and Norwich as a wool-stapler, trading in worsted and bombazine. He was an amateur botanist who collected succulent plants, and was, according to his grandson Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, &quot;mainly a self-educated man and a fair German scholar&quot;. Joseph Hooker was related to the sixteenth-century historian John Hooker, and the theologian Richard Hooker.

His mother, Lydia Vincent, the daughter of James Vincent, belonged to a family of Norwich worsted weavers and artists. Her cousin, William Jackson, was William Jackson Hooker&#x27;s godfather. Upon his death in 1789 William Jackson bequeathed his estate in Seasalter, Kent, to his godson, who inherited it when he was 21. Lydia Vincent&#x27;s nephew, George Vincent, was one of the most talented of the Norwich School of painters.

== Biography ==
===Early life and education===
William Jackson Hooker was born on 6 July 1785 at 7177 Magdalen Street, Norwich. A child named William Jacson Hooker was christened by his parents Joseph and Lydia Hooker at the nonconformist Tabernacle in Norwich on 9 November 1785. He attended the Norwich Grammar School from about 1792 until his late teens, but none of the school records from the period he was there have been kept, and little is known of his schooldays. He developed an interest in entomology, reading and natural history during his boyhood.

In 1805, Hooker discovered a moss (now known as &quot;Buxbaumia aphylla&quot;) when out walking on Rackheath, north of Norwich. He visited the Norwich botanist Sir James Edward Smith to consult his Linnean collections. Smith advised the young Hooker to contact the botanist Dawson Turner about his discovery.

Upon reaching the age of 21 he inherited an estate in Kent from his godfather. His independent means allowed him to travel and develop his interest in natural history.

As a young man Hooker was fascinated by the endemic birds of Norfolk and spent time studying them on the Broads and the Norfolk coast. He became skilled in drawing them and understanding their behaviour. He also studied insects and, when still at school, his skills were appreciated by the Reverend William Kirby. In 1805, Kirby dedicated the &quot;Omphalapion hookerorum&quot;, a species of weevil, to him and his brother Joseph: &quot;I am indebted to an excellent naturalist, Mr. W. J. Hooker, of Norwich, who first discovered it, for this species. Many other nondescripts have been taken by him and his brother, Mr. J. Hooker, and I name this insect after them, as a memorial of my sense of their ability and exertions in the service of my favourite department of natural history.&quot;

In 1805 Hooker went to be trained in estate management at Starston Hall, Norfolk, perhaps because of the need to be able to manage his own newly acquired estates. He lived there with Robert Paul, a gentleman farmer. In 1806 he was introduced to Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society. He elected to the Linnean Society of London that year.

===Early friends and patrons===

When a young man, Hooker gained the patronage and friendship of some of most important naturalists in eastern England, including Smith, who had founded the Linnean Society of London in 1788 and owned Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s collection of plants and books, the botanist and antiquarian Dawson Turner, and Joseph Banks.

In 1807, Hooker was bitten by an adder when walking near Burgh Castle and badly hurt. He was found by friends and taken to Dawson Turner&#x27;s house, where he was cared for until he recovered completely from the effects of the snake&#x27;s bite. Once he had fully recovered, he accompanied Turner and his wife Mary on a tour of Scotland. In 1808, he again travelled to Scotland, this time accompanied by his friend William Borrer. During this journey he discovered a new species of moss, &quot;Andreaea nivalis&quot;, on Ben Nevis, which may have led to him publishing a paper &quot;Some Observations on the Genus Andreaea&quot; in 1810.

Hooker produced the illustrations for James Edward Smith&#x27;s paper &quot;Characters of &quot;Hookeria&quot;, a new Genus of Mosses, with Descriptions of Ten Species&quot;, a genus named by Smith in honour of William and his older brother Joseph. Hooker had discovered a specimen of the moss in the countryside around Holt. From 1806 to 1809 he was a constant guest of Dawson Turner in Yarmouth, where he produced the illustrations for Turner&#x27;s four-volume &quot;Historia Fucorum&quot;. He also spent time in London, where he took up rooms in Frith Street, near the British Museum.

By 1807, Hooker had begun work as a supervising manager at a brewery at Halesworth, in partnership with Dawson Turner and Samuel Paget. Sharing a quarter of the company, he lived in the brewery house, which had a large garden and a greenhouse in which he grew orchids. The brewing venture proved to be unsuccessful, for he had no capacity for business. He remained as the manager there for ten years, living at 15 Quay Street, Halesworth.

===Excursions abroad===

Hooker inherited enough money to be able to travel at his own expense. His first botanical expedition abroad—at the suggestion of the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, who had made a previous visit in 1772—was to Iceland, in 1809. He sailed on the &quot;Margaret and Anne&quot;, arriving at Reykjavík in June. That month an attempt at Icelandic independence was staged by the Danish adventurer Jørgen Jørgensen.

During his return voyage, the &quot;Margaret and Anne&quot;, in a dead calm, was discovered to be on fire, the result of sabotage which was afterwards found to have been planned by Danish prisoners. Hooker and the ship&#x27;s company were all rescued, but the fire destroyed most of his drawings and notes. Banks later offered Hooker the use of his own papers, and with these materials, along with the surviving parts of his own journal, his good memory aided him to publish an account of the island, its inhabitants and flora: his &quot;A Journal of a Tour in Iceland (1809)&quot; was privately circulated in 1811 and published two years later.

In 1810–11, he made extensive preparations, and sacrifices which proved financially serious, with a view to travelling to Ceylon, to accompany the newly-appointed governor, Sir Robert Brownrigg. He sold property inherited from his godfather, William Jackson, to raise the necessary capital for the journey. Political upheaval there led to the project being abandoned. In 1812 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London.

In 1813, encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks, he considered travelling to Java, but was dissuaded from the idea by friends and family.

In 1814, he travelled in Europe for nine months, going to Paris with the Turners, then travelling alone to Switzerland, southern France, and Italy, where he studied plants and visited notable botanists. The following year he married the eldest daughter of his friend Dawson Turner. Settling at Halesworth, he devoted himself to the formation of his herbarium, which became of worldwide renown among botanists. In 1815, he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

===Career in Glasgow===

In February 1820, Hooker was appointed as the regius professor of botany in the University of Glasgow, taking over from the Scottish physician and botanist Robert Graham, and inheriting a small botanic garden that was underfunded and lacking in plants. In May he was received by the University and read his inaugural thesis in Latin, written by his father-in-law, Dawson Turner. Hooker was faced with the prospect of delivering lectures to students, when he had never previously taught, and was ignorant of some aspects of botany: his position within the medical faculty inspired him to study for a medical degree.

He soon became popular as a lecturer, his style being both clear and eloquent, and people such as local army officers came to attend them. For 15 years he delivered a summer course on botany, required to be studied by all medical students—for the remaining months of the year he was free to study, work on his publications and his herbarium, and correspond with other botanists.

His classroom was remarkable for having drawings of plants on display to assist the students, and their course included trips to study plants, organised by Hooker. Student numbers increased from 30 in 1820 to 130 ten years later. He earned £144 in his first year, which later increased, but still needed to supplement his income by tutoring two boys from wealthy families, who lived with the family.
His years at Glasgow were his most productive, when he was known as the most active botanist in the country. In 1821 he brought out the &quot;Flora Scotica&quot;, written to be used by his botany students. He was awarded a doctorate by Glasgow University in 1821. He worked with the lithographer and botanist Thomas Hopkirk to establish the Royal Botanic Institution of Glasgow and to lay out and develop the Botanic Gardens. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1823.

Under Hooker, the Botanic Gardens enjoyed remarkable success and became prominent in the botanic world. The garden was his responsibility and he set to work developing it with the help of his extensive network of friends and acquaintances. Principal among these was Sir Joseph Banks, who promised Kew&#x27;s help. The botanic gardens steadily acquired new plants, often from visiting naturalists, or from students who had travelled. His work on the botanic garden resulted in experts expressing the view that &quot;Glasgow would not suffer by comparison with any other establishment in Europe&quot;.

During his professorship at Glasgow, his numerous published works included &quot;Flora Londinensis&quot;, &quot;British Flora&quot;, &quot;Flora Boreali-Americana&quot;, &quot;Icones Filicum&quot;, &quot;The Botany of Captain Beechey&#x27;s Voyage to the Bering Sea&quot;, &quot;Icones Plantarum&quot;, &quot;Exotic Flora&quot; (1823–27), 13 volumes of &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot; (from 1827), and the first seven volumes of &quot;Annals of Botany&quot;. Mount Hooker, between Alberta and British Columbia, was named for him in 1827 by David Douglas.

In 1836, Hooker was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order and a Knight Bachelor in recognition of his work at Glasgow and his services to botany. Although officially recognised in this way, he became increasingly disillusioned with how his work was viewed by the University authorities, and by 1839 was feeling as if the &quot;dignity of the position was stripped to one of ridicule and his work was dismissed as of no account&quot;.

During his time in Glasgow, he lived, for several summers, at Invereck at the head of the Holy Loch. &quot;He seems to have devoted special attention to the vegetation of the neighbourhood,&quot; wrote John Colegate in 1868. &quot;The result of his inquiries were published in the Rev.

The origins of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew can be traced to the merging of the royal estates of Richmond and Kew in 1772, when the garden at Kew Park formed by Henry, Lord Capell of Tewkesbury was enlarged by Augusta, Dowager Princess of Wales. The gardens were developed by the architect William Chambers, who built the pagoda in 1761, and by George III, who was aided by William Aiton and Sir Joseph Banks. The Dutch House, now known as Kew Palace, was purchased by George III in 1781 for his children. The adjoining White House was demolished in 1802. The plant collections at Kew were first enlarged systematically by Francis Masson in 1771, but had since the death of George III slowly declined. In 1838, a Parliamentary review of the nation&#x27;s royal gardens recommended the development of Kew as a national botanical garden.
In April 1841 he was appointed as the Garden&#x27;s first full time Director, on the resignation of William Townsend Aiton. Following his appointment as director, a position he had long wished for, he wrote &quot;I feel as if I were to begin life over again&quot;, in a letter to Dawson Turner. He started on an annual salary of £300, with an additional allowance of £200. To Allan, who described Hooker as a man with &quot;drive, enthusiasm and creative ability&quot;, he was eminently suited for the post, being a professional botanist, an artist, a leader with connections to others in the botanical world, who was knowledgeable about plants from Britain and those collected from around the world. The curator of Kew Gardens during Hooker&#x27;s period as Director was the experienced and knowledgeable botanist John Smith (1798–1888).

Under Hooker&#x27;s direction the gardens expanded considerably in size. Initially about in size, they were extended to in 1841. An arboretum of was introduced, many new glass-houses were erected, and a museum of economic botany was established. In 1843 the Palm House, to a design by the architect Decimus Burton and the iron founder Richard Turner, was constructed at Kew. The gardens and glasshouses were opened daily to the visiting public, who were allowed to wander freely there for the first time. Sir William himself wandered around during opening hours, lending his advice.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1862.

Hooker lived with his family at West Park, a large house in which he accommodated 13 rooms of books in his library, which was seen as a public institution by the world&#x27;s botanical experts, who were never turned away. Among his visitors were Queen Victoria, her husband Prince Albert and their children; during 1865—the year Hooker died—the attendance had risen to 529,241.
Under Hooker&#x27;s direction Kew became the centre of an emerging interconnected worldwide network of botanical expertise, and staff recommended by him joined expeditions or worked for botanical gardens around the world. He was invariably consulted when government questions arose about botanical matters. Newly propagated plants and sent from Kew to private and public gardens in Britain, and to botanical gardens overseas, in some cases to be developed as crops.

===Marriage and family===

In June 1815, he married Maria Sarah Turner, the eldest daughter of Dawson Turner and Mary Palgrave. Maria was an amateur artist who collected mosses, and who with her sister Elizabeth illustrated them for her husband. The couple toured the Lake District and across Ireland on their honeymoon, before travelling to Scotland.

They had five children. William Dawson Hooker (born 1816) was a naturalist who trained as a doctor. He published &quot;Notes on Norway&quot; (1837 and 1839). He emigrated with his new wife to Jamaica to practise medicine, but died at Kingston, aged 24. Joseph Dalton Hooker (born 1817) became a botanist and was appointed the first assistant director at Kew. He served in this post for 10 years, before taking over as director from his father in 1865. The three daughters in the family were Maria (born 1819), Elizabeth (born 1820), and Mary Harriet (born 1825), who died aged sixteen.

===Death===
He was engaged on the &quot;Synopsis filicum&quot; with the botanist John Gilbert Baker when he contracted a throat infection then epidemic at Kew.

==Works==

Hooker studied mosses, liverworts, and ferns, and published a monograph on a group of liverworts, &quot;British Jungermanniae&quot;, in 1816. This was succeeded by a new edition of William Curtis&#x27;s &quot;Flora Londinensis&quot;, for which he wrote the descriptions (18171828); by a description of the &quot;Plantae cryptogamicae&quot; of Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland; by the &quot;Muscologia&quot;, a very complete account of the mosses of Britain and Ireland, prepared in conjunction with Thomas Taylor and first published in 1818; and by his &quot;Musci exotici&quot; (2 volumes, 18181820), devoted to new foreign mosses and other cryptogamic plants.

Hooker published more than 20 major botanical works over a period of 50 years, including &quot;British Jungermanniae&quot; (1816), &quot;Musci Exotici&quot; (18181820), &quot;Icones Filicum&quot; (18291831), &quot;Genera Filicum&quot; (1838) and &quot;Species Filicum&quot; (18461864). Other works include &quot;Flora Scotica&quot; (1821), &quot;The British Flora&quot; (1830) and &quot;Flora Borealis Americana; or, The Botany of the Northern Parts of British America&quot; (1840).

With William Wilson he edited the exsiccata series &quot;Musci Americani; or, specimens of mosses, Jungermanniae, &amp;c. collected by the late Thomas Drummond, in the Southern States of North America. Arranged and named by W. Wilson and Sir W. J. Hooker&quot; (1841).

<text>Francis Gwynne Tudor (29 January 1866 – 10 January 1922) was an Australian politician who served as the leader of the Australian Labor Party from 1916 until his death. He had previously been a government minister under Andrew Fisher and Billy Hughes.

Tudor was born in Melbourne to Welsh immigrant parents. He left school at a young age to enter the workforce, serving an apprenticeship in the felt hat industry and later studying his trade for periods in England and the United States. He became involved in trade unionism in England, and after returning to Australia served as president of the Felt Hatters&#x27; Union. Tudor was elected president of the Victorian Trades Hall Council in 1900. The following year, he was elected to the new federal parliament as a representative of the Labor Party. He was chosen as the parliamentary party&#x27;s first whip, and held that position until entering cabinet in 1908.

Tudor served as Minister for Trade and Customs from 1908 to 1909, 1910 to 1913, and 1914 to 1916, in the governments of Andrew Fisher and Billy Hughes. He remained loyal to the Labor Party during the split over conscription in 1916, and was elected party leader after Hughes&#x27; expulsion. He replaced Joseph Cook as leader of the opposition upon the formation of the third Hughes Ministry in February 1917. Tudor led Labor to the 1917 and 1919 federal elections, on both occasions suffering heavy defeats. His death in office at the age of 55 came after a long period of ill health. He was the first leader of a major Australian political party to die in office, and was accorded a state funeral.

==Early life==
Tudor was born to John Llewellyn Tudor, a ballastman, and Ellen Charlotte Tudor, née Burt, both of Welsh origin, on 29 January 1866 at Williamstown, Victoria. However, the family soon moved to the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, where Tudor lived most of his life.

Upon leaving Richmond Central State School, and after short spells in a sawmill and a boot factory, Tudor entered the felt hat industry. Tudor apprenticed in Abbotsford and then travelled across Victoria in the hat trade. Tudor went to England, working in London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, marrying Alice Smale in Denton, Lancashire in 1894. Smale died the same year, but Tudor continued in the felt hat trade by moving to London and becoming vice-president of the local branch of the Felt Hatters&#x27; Union. In 1897 Tudor remarried to Fanny Jane Mead.

As vice-president of the union Tudor became interested in union politics (as many Labor politicians were before their entry into politics) and persuaded the British unions to adopt the union label principle. Returning to Australia, Tudor worked at Abbotsford&#x27;s mills and took a seat in the Victorian Trades Hall Council. In 1900 he became president.

Tudor was president of the Victorian Life Saving Society, and held a Bronze Medallion as a qualified life saver. He had a long association with the Richmond Football Club, and served as club president from 1909 to 1918.

==Entry into politics==

A prominent figure in Richmond, Victoria, Tudor turned the Division of Yarra into the safest Labor seat in the country by winning that seat by a large margin in the 1901 federal election. Tudor was a deacon of the Congregational Church and angered some Protestants with his calls for Home Rule for Ireland.

==Frontbencher==

Tudor was immediately elected the Labor Party&#x27;s whip and assistant secretary, before ascending to the position of secretary in 1904. Under the leadership of Andrew Fisher, he was Minister for Trade and Customs during the three Fisher ministries, from 1908 to 1909, 1910–1913, and 1914–1915. According to the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot;, he was an &quot;efficient administrator, with an eye for detail&quot; who &quot;made friends and earned respect on both sides of the House, and was considered to be the most moderate of the Victorian Labor members&quot;.

Billy Hughes replaced Fisher as prime minister in 1915. Tudor maintained his position in the ministry, and initially remained neutral during the debate within the ALP over overseas conscription, which Hughes supported. After pressure from his local political labour council in Richmond, he eventually came out against conscription and resigned from the ministry in September 1916. Tudor became a leader of the &quot;No&quot; campaign during the 1916 conscription referendum, alongside T. J. Ryan and William Higgs. On 14 November, the ALP split irrevocably over the issue. Hughes led his supporters out of a caucus meeting and formed a new National Labor Party, allowing him to stay on as prime minister with the aid of the Liberals. On 15 November Tudor was elected unopposed as the new leader of the Labor Party in his place – the party&#x27;s first Australian-born leader. According to historian Denis Murphy, he was likely elected to the leadership simply because he was the first member of cabinet to resign over the issue. Tudor did not succeed Liberal leader Joseph Cook as Leader of the Opposition until 17 February 1917, when the Third Hughes Ministry was sworn in with Hughes as leader of the composite Nationalist Party.

==Leader of the Opposition==

Tudor led his party to a landslide defeat at the 1917 federal election. The ALP won just 22 seats out of 75, and the party was severely weakened by several of its senior figures following Hughes out of the party. Tudor was a leader of the successful &quot;No&quot; campaign at the 1917 conscription referendum. He was not regarded as a good public speaker, and his speeches were often seen as dull or confusing.

While Tudor was respected within the ALP for his loyalty, he was often overshadowed by T. J. Ryan, the charismatic premier of Queensland. Ryan was the only remaining ALP premier in the country, and frequently campaigned outside his own state. In May 1918, Tudor had to officially deny a report in &quot;The Age&quot; that he would step aside in favour of Ryan prior to the next federal election. There was also some speculation that Fisher – who had been appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom – would return and resume the leadership. In May 1919, their former cabinet colleague King O&#x27;Malley wrote to Fisher in London that &quot;many people are of the opinion that Labor will not win the next election under Tudor&#x27;s leadership&quot;.

In October 1919, the ALP Federal Conference passed a resolution inviting Ryan to enter federal politics and appointed him as national campaign director. Tudor was &quot;unconsciously insulted&quot; by a number of delegates, who effectively declared that he could not lead Labor to an election victory. His leadership was defended by his supporters in the Victorian delegation, who threatened a walkout, and also by those who viewed the resolution as usurping the role of the party caucus in choosing their leader.

At the election later that year, Tudor led the ALP to a second heavy election loss – 26 seats out of 75. He was twice taken ill during the campaign with &quot;attacks of hemorrhage&quot;. Tudor was increasingly seen as an ineffectual leader, and several elements were contemplating replacing him with Ryan. However, Ryan&#x27;s early death in 1921 prevented him from taking Tudor&#x27;s place. Tudor&#x27;s own health became markedly worse during 1921, and he was increasingly unable to carry out his duties. In September 1921, the party elected Matthew Charlton as assistant leader in the House of Representatives.

==Death==
On 10 January 1922, Tudor died, aged 55. He was the first leader of the Labor Party to die in office, and the first Opposition Leader never to become prime minister. He was succeeded as the member for Yarra by future Prime Minister James Scullin. Tudor was the first of five consecutive Opposition Leaders who was not a former prime minister.

Tudor&#x27;s estate was valued at £4,629, around half of which was real estate. His widow went bankrupt within the year, after her brother&#x27;s firm (in which she had invested most of her money) went broke.

Kim Edward Beazley, who wrote a series of articles on ALP leaders for &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; in 1966, wrote of Tudor that he &quot;held the Labor movement together in the face of massive forces of disintegration, and he did it by his dignity and utter absence of bitterness, hate or rancour&quot;.

<text>Elias Howe Jr. (; July 9, 1819October 3, 1867) was an American inventor best known for his creation of the modern lockstitch sewing machine.

==Early life==
Elias Howe Jr. was born on July 9, 1819, to Dr. Elias Howe Sr (1792–1867) and Polly (Bemis) Howe (1791–1871) in Spencer, Massachusetts. Howe spent his childhood and early adult years in Massachusetts, where he apprenticed in a textile factory in Lowell beginning in 1835. After mill closings due to the Panic of 1837, he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to work as a mechanic with carding machinery, apprenticing along with his cousin Nathaniel P. Banks. In the beginning of 1838, he apprenticed in the shop of Ari Davis, a master mechanic in Cambridge who specialized in the manufacture and repair of chronometers and other precision instruments. It was in the employ of Davis that Howe seized upon the idea of the sewing machine.

He married Elizabeth Jennings Ames, daughter of Simon Ames and Jane B. Ames, on March 3, 1841, in Cambridge. They had three children: Jane Robinson Howe (1842–1912), Simon Ames Howe (1844–1883), and Julia Maria Howe (1846–1869). He then married Rose Halladay.

==Invention of sewing machine and career==

Howe was not the first to conceive of the idea of a sewing machine. Many other people had formulated the idea of such a machine before him, one as early as 1790, and some had even patented their designs and produced working machines, in one case at least 80 of them. However, Howe originated significant refinements to the design concepts of his predecessors, and on September 10, 1846, he was awarded the first United States patent () for a sewing machine using a lockstitch design. His machine contained the three essential features common to most modern machines: a needle with the eye at the point, a shuttle operating beneath the cloth to form the lock stitch, and an automatic feed.

A possibly apocryphal account of how he came up with the idea for placing the eye of the needle at the point is recorded in a family history of his mother&#x27;s family:

Despite securing his patent, Howe had considerable difficulty finding investors in the United States to finance production of his invention, so his elder brother Amasa Bemis Howe traveled to England in October 1846 to seek financing. Amasa was able to sell his first machine for £250 to William Thomas of Cheapside, London, who owned a factory for the manufacture of corsets, umbrellas and valises. Elias and his family joined Amasa in London in 1848, but after business disputes with Thomas and failing health of his wife, Howe returned nearly penniless to the United States. His wife Elizabeth, who preceded Elias back to the United States, died in Cambridge, Massachusetts shortly after his return in 1849.

Despite his efforts to sell his machine, other entrepreneurs began manufacturing sewing machines. Howe was forced to defend his patent in a court case that lasted from 1849 to 1854 because he found that Isaac Singer with cooperation from Walter Hunt had perfected a facsimile of his machine and was selling it with the same lockstitch that Howe had invented and patented. He won the dispute and earned considerable royalties from Singer and others for sales of his invention.

Howe contributed much of the money he earned to providing equipment for the 17th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry of the Union Army during the Civil War, in which Howe served as a private in Company D. Due to his faltering health he performed light duty, often seen walking with the aid of his shillelagh, and took on the position of Regimental Postmaster, serving out his time riding to and from Baltimore with war news. He&#x27;d enlisted August 14, 1862, and then mustered out July 19, 1865.

==Involvement in inventing the zipper==
Howe received a patent in 1851 for an &quot;Automatic, Continuous Clothing Closure&quot;. Perhaps because of the success of his sewing machine, he did not try to seriously market it, missing recognition he might otherwise have received.

==Adult life and legacy==

Between 1854 and 1871/72, Elias&#x27;s older brother, Amasa Bemis Howe (died in 1868), and later his son Benjamin Porter Howe, owned and operated a factory in New York City, producing sewing machines under the name of the &quot;Howe Sewing Machine Co&quot;., which won a gold medal at the London Exhibition of 1862. Between 1865 and 1867, Elias himself established The &quot;Howe Machine Co&quot;. in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that was operated by Elias&#x27;s sons-in-law, the Stockwell Brothers, until about 1886. Elias Howe&#x27;s sewing machine won a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1867, and that same year he was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur by Napoleon III for his invention. In 1873, Benjamin P. Howe sold the Howe Sewing Machine Co. factory and name to the Howe Machine Co., which merged the two companies.

Elias Howe died at age 48, on October 3, 1867, of gout and a massive blood clot. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. His second wife, Rose Halladay, who died on October 10, 1890, is buried with him. Both Singer and Howe were multi-millionaires.

Howe&#x27;s father died two months later on December 28, 1867, one day after his 75th birthday.

Howe was commemorated with a 5-cent stamp in the Famous American Inventors series issued October 14, 1940.

The 1965 Beatles movie &quot;Help!&quot; is dedicated to his memory.
In 2004 he was inducted into the United States National Inventors Hall of Fame. 

==Genealogy==
Howe was a descendant of John Howe (1602–1680) who arrived in Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 from Brinklow, Warwickshire, England, and settled in Sudbury, Massachusetts. Howe was also a descendant of Edmund Rice, another early immigrant to Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Bonpland was born as Aimé Jacques Alexandre Goujaud in La Rochelle, France, on 22, 28, or 29 August 1773. His father was a physician and, around 1790, he joined his brother Michael in Paris, where they both studied medicine. From 1791, they attended courses given at Paris&#x27;s Botanical Museum of Natural History. Their teachers included Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, and René Louiche Desfontaines; Aimé further studied under Jean-Nicolas Corvisart and may have attended classes given by Pierre-Joseph Desault at the Hôtel-Dieu. During this period, Aimé also befriended his fellow student, Xavier Bichat.

Amid the turmoil of the French Revolution and Revolutionary Wars, Bonpland served as a surgeon in the French army or navy.

Having befriended Alexander von Humboldt at Corvisart&#x27;s house, he joined him on a five-year journey to Tenerife and the Spanish colonial empire in the Americas, traveling to what later became the independent states of Venezuela, Cuba, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Mexico, as well as the Orinoco and Amazon basins, with a last stop in the United States. During this trip, he collected and classified about 6,000 plants that were mostly unknown in Europe up to that time. His account of these findings was published as a series of volumes from 1808 to 1816 entitled &quot;Equatorial Plants&quot; ().

Upon his return to Paris, Napoleon granted him a pension of 3000 francs per year in return for the many specimens he bestowed upon the Museum of Natural History. The Empress Josephine was very fond of him and installed him as superintendent over the gardens at Malmaison, where many seeds he had brought from the Americas were cultivated. In 1813, he published his &quot;Description of the Rare Plants Cultivated at Malmaison and in Navarre&quot; (&quot;&quot;). During this period, he also became acquainted with Gay-Lussac, Arago, and other eminent scientists and, after the abdication of Fontainebleau, vainly pleaded with Napoleon to retire to Venezuela. He was present at Josephine&#x27;s deathbed.

In 1816, he took various European plants to Buenos Aires, where he was elected professor of natural history. He soon left his post, however, to explore the interior of South America. In 1821, he established a colony at Santa Ana near the Paraná for the specific object of harvesting and selling yerba mate. The colony was located in territory claimed by both Paraguay and Argentina; further, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, dictator of Paraguay, &quot;feared that Bonpland&#x27;s success in cultivating &quot;mate&quot; would interfere with his own attempt to monopolize that business.&quot; The Paraguayans therefore destroyed the colony on December 8, 1821, and Bonpland was arrested as a spy and detained at Santa Maria, Paraguay until 1829. During his captivity, he married and had several children. He was given freedom of movement and acted as a physician for the local poor and the military garrison. At the same epoch, the Swiss naturalist Johann Rudolph Rengger also stayed in Paraguay: he was not allowed to cross the strictly guarded border, but was free to circulate pending the request of a special permit for each excursion.

Bonpland was freed in 1829 and in 1831 returned to Argentina, where he settled at San Borja in Corrientes. There, aged 58, he married a local woman and made a living farming and trading in yerba mate. In 1853, he returned to Santa Ana, where he cultivated the orange trees he had introduced. He received a piastre estate from the Corrientes government in gratitude for his work in the province. The small town around it is now known as &quot;Bonpland&quot; in his honor. A different small town in Misiones province just south of Santa Ana (Misiones) is also named Bonpland.

He died at age 84, at San Borja, Santa Ana, or Restauración on 4 or 11 May 1858, before his planned return to Paris.

==Legacy==
His collection of plant specimens deposited in Paris at the National Museum of Natural History, France was curated by Alicia Lourteig.

Bonpland&#x27;s biography was written by Adolphe Brunel. A fictionalized account of his travels with Humboldt occurs in Daniel Kehlmann&#x27;s &quot;Die Vermessung der Welt&quot;, translated by Carol Brown Janeway as &quot;Measuring the World: A Novel&quot;.

Bonpland Street in the upscale Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo Hollywood lies among streets named after Charles Darwin, Robert FitzRoy, and Alexander von Humboldt. There is also a Bonpland Street in the city of Bahía Blanca, Argentina, in Caracas, Venezuela, and in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Many animals and plants are also named in his honor, including the plant genus &quot;Bonplandia&quot;, the willow &quot;Salix bonplandiana&quot;, the squid &quot;Grimalditeuthis bonplandi&quot;, and the orchid &quot;Ornithocephalus bonplandi&quot;.

The lunar crater Bonpland is named after him. Also Pico Bonpland in the Venezuelan Andes is named to his honor, although he never visited the Venezuelan Andes. Mount Bonpland in New Zealand also bears his name. The mountain is near the head of Lake Wakatipu in the South Island.

The Bonpland Prize set up by the National Horticultural Society of France to promote the creation or restoration of pleasure gardens by amateur gardeners, was named after Aimé Bonpland.

<doc id="398763" wikidata="Q7875072" url="?curid=398763" title="USS Vermont (1848)">
<text>USS &quot;Vermont&quot; was originally intended to be a ship of the line for the United States Navy when laid down in 1818, but was not commissioned until 1862, when she was too outdated to be used as anything but a stores and receiving ship.

== Service history ==
&quot;Vermont&quot; was one of nine 74-gun warships authorized by United States Congress on 29 April 1816. She was laid down at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, in September 1818, finished about 1825, and kept on the stocks until finally launched on 15 September 1848 in the interest of both space and fire safety considerations. However, &quot;Vermont&quot; was not commissioned at this time. Instead the already aged ship-of-the-line remained in ordinary at Boston until the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861.

By the time Civil War broke out, the cavernous hull of the vessel was badly needed as a store and receiving ship at Port Royal, South Carolina, and she was commissioned at Boston on 30 January 1862, Commander Augustus S. Baldwin in command. She received orders to sail for Port Royal for duty with Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont&#x27;s South Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 17 February 1862 and left Boston on 24 February 1862 under tow by the steamer &quot;Kensington&quot;.

That evening, a violent northwest gale accompanied by snow struck the vessels while they were off Cape Cod Light, Massachusetts. &quot;Kensington&quot; let go the tow lines, but &quot;Vermont&quot; refused to obey her helm, broached, and had all her sails and most of her boats blown and torn away. The gale raged for 50 hours; and, by the morning of 26 February 1862, &quot;Vermont&quot; was drifting eastward with no rudder, her berth deck flooded, and much of the interior of the vessel destroyed. Later on 26 February, &quot;Vermont&quot; sighted the schooner &quot;Flying Mist&quot;, hailed her, put a man on board, and persuaded her captain to return to the United States East Coast and report the helpless condition of the ship to naval authorities. Rescue vessels began to reach the stricken ship on 7 March 1862 and enabled &quot;Vermont&quot; to sail into Port Royal under her own power on 12 April 1862.

&quot;Vermont&quot; remained anchored at Port Royal, where she served the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron as an ordnance, hospital, receiving, and store ship and drew praise from Rear Admiral Du Pont. On 12 December 1863, she rescued the crew of the American bark &quot;Alice Provost&quot;, which was wrecked while trying to enter port at Port Royal. United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles ordered &quot;Vermont&quot; to return to New York City for &quot;public service&quot; on 25 July 1864. She left Port Royal on 2 August 1864 and was replaced there by her sister ship-of-the-line .

&quot;Vermont&quot; remained at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, for the next 37 years, serving both as a store and receiving ship. She was condemned and struck from the Navy list on 19 December 1901 and was sold at New York on 17 April 1902.

South Hamgyong is divided into three cities (&quot;si&quot;), two districts (one &quot;gu&quot; and one &quot;chigu&quot;), and 15 counties (&quot;gun&quot;). These are further divided into villages (&quot;ri&quot; and &quot;dong&quot;, with dong also denoting neighborhoods in cities), with each county additionally having one town (&quot;up&quot;) which acts as its administrative center. These are detailed on each county&#x27;s individual page. Some cities are also divided into wards known as &quot;guyok&quot;, which are administered just below the city level and also listed on the individual page.

<text>Constant Chevillon (born 26 October 1880 in Annoire (Jura); died 25 March 1944 in Lyon) was a French occultist who was Grand Master of the Freemasonry Rite of Memphis-Misraïm and head of FUDOFSI and other occult societies.

== Education and civil work ==
At an early age, his prodigious memory and learning genius made their debut and the priest decided to teach him Latin. At the age of twelve, he entered the College of Montciel, near Lons-le-Saunier (Jura). He studied Literature, Ancient History, the Classics and Philosophy. He moved on to higher branches of learning, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the Faculty of Letters at Lyon where he also received his Licentiate&#x27;s Degree and a Fellowship. He studied philosophy under the celebrated Professor Arthur Hennequin. He knew Socrates&#x27; Precepts of Self-knowledge, but the one that guided his life was: &quot;Renounce thyself while serving others&quot;. His philosophy professor was such an ideal for him that after Hennequin&#x27;s death, he left the university.

He went to work at the Société Générale, a bank in Lyon and worked there until 1913. Later he went to work for the Banque Nationale de Crédit in Lyon and continued his work there until his death.

== Esoteric activities ==
As a member of the Rosicrucian Fraternity, he was opposed to Harvey Spencer Lewis&#x27; AMORC and FUDOSI.

He was enthroned as Patriarch of the Eglise Gnostique Universelle after Jean Bricaud, and succeeded by one of his students, René Chambellant, who maintained the compendium of esoteric societies in cooperation with the Gnostic church.

== Death ==
During World War II, he was shot and killed by the militia (French police submitted to the Gestapo) in a brutal hostage murder on 23 March 1944 in Lyon.

<doc id="398771" wikidata="Q6819482" url="?curid=398771" title="Merion Station, Pennsylvania">
<text>Merion Station, also known as Merion, is an unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. It borders Philadelphia to its west and is one of the communities that make up the Philadelphia Main Line. Merion Station is part of Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County. The community is known for its grand mansions and for the wealth of its residents.

Merion Station is contiguous to the Overbrook and Overbrook Park neighborhoods of Philadelphia and is also bordered by Lower Merion Township&#x27;s unincorporated communities of Wynnewood and Bala Cynwyd and the borough of Narberth. As of the 2020 United States census the population was 5,741.

==History==
Merion Meeting House was built at the present intersection of Montgomery Avenue and Meetinghouse Lane in 1695 by Welsh settlers.

The General Wayne Inn and Merion Friends Meeting House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Merion Friends Meeting House is also a National Historic Landmark.

== Nomenclature ==
The community was named after Merionethshire, Wales, the native home of a large share of the first settlers. Merion is often referred to as &quot;Merion Station,&quot; as this is the place name that the United States Postal Service recommends using in order to distinguish Merion from other areas in Pennsylvania with similar names. However, the historical name of the town, used by historical figures such as Theodore Roosevelt, is Merion.

== Merion Civic Association ==
 The Merion Civic Association was organized in 1913 by Edward W. Bok with the motto &quot;To be Nation right and State right, we must first be Community right.&quot; The Merion Civic Association made several important improvements to Merion such as paving, better lighting, cast-iron street signs, better fire and police protection, and planned tree-planting. President Theodore Roosevelt wrote an article in 1917 for Bok&#x27;s magazine entitled &quot;Model Merion.&quot;

After World War I, the Merion Civic Association sought to construct a community center in memorial to the 81 men from Merion Station who served in the armed forces during the conflict. Eldridge R. Johnson, the founder and president of the Victor Talking Machine Company, donated his house on Hazelhurst Avenue to this cause. The house was demolished and a new Merion Tribute House was built on its foundation. It was built with careful attention to detail, with Gothic patterns and local stone. The stone was shaped on site and window mullions were all hand cut to match. The Tribute House is still used today for meetings of the Merion Civic Association and is supported by renting the space for parties or meetings. Merion also has its own public elementary school—Merion Elementary of the Lower Merion School District on South Bowman Avenue.

== Institutions ==
The institution for which Merion Station was singularly world-renowned was the Barnes Foundation, an important art collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings amassed by drug entrepreneur Albert C. Barnes that since the 1920s had been housed in a granite mansion with gardens on Latches Lane. The Barnes collection has been moved to a newly designed museum building on Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Center City Philadelphia that includes a replication of Barnes&#x27;s original gallery in Merion. The Barnes Foundation Merion grounds remain open to the public as the Arboretum at the Barnes Foundation.

Merion Botanical Park is located between Merion Road and the railroad tracks and City Line Ave and Civic Center Drive.

==Education==
The zoned school district is the Lower Merion School District. School zoning is as follows: Elementary schools with attendance boundaries covering portions of the CDP include: Merion Elementary School (the majority of the area), Cynwyd Elementary School, and Belmont Hills Elementary School. Almost all of the CDP is in the zone for Bala Cynwyd Middle School, while a portion is in Welsh Valley Middle School. All of the CDP is in a choice zone where students may choose between Harriton High School and Lower Merion High School.

In addition to the public schools, Catholic, all-girls Merion Mercy Academy and its feeder school, Catholic, coeducational Waldron Mercy Academy, and Kohelet Yeshiva High School, formerly Stern Hebrew High School, are located in Merion. Before its move to Bryn Mawr, Akiba Hebrew Academy was located in Merion as was Episcopal Academy prior to its consolidation in Newtown Square.

Saint Joseph&#x27;s University straddles City Avenue. It also purchased and repurposed the former Episcopal Academy campus on the Merion Stationside of the Avenue to contain classroom and student activity buildings. The university bought and renovated Merion Gardens Apartments, at the northwest corner of the East Wynnewood Road/City Avenue intersection, for student housing.

== Transportation ==
The Paoli/Thorndale Line, originally part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, was built through Merion station in the late 19th century. Most SEPTA trains heading east to Philadelphia or west to Thorndale stop at Merion Station, located in the center of Merion Station.

Other public transportation options in Merion Station include the SEPTA Route 44 buses that travels along Old Lancaster Road and Montgomery Avenue between Ardmore and Center City, some of which stop at the Narberth Station; the SEPTA Route 65 bus that traverses the length of City Line Avenue; and the SEPTA Route 105 bus that runs the entire length of the Main Line along Lancaster Avenue (Route 30) and stops at the Wynnewood Shopping Center. All are within walking distance of Merion Station.

== Demographics and government ==
Merion Station is located in zipcode 19066. Lower Merion Township is responsible for all governance.

According to the 2000 U.S. census, Merion Station has 5,951 residents, 93.6% of whom are White; 2.1% are Black or African American; 2.7% are Asian; and 1.3% are Hispanic or Latino. 95.1% have a high school diploma or higher and 76.7% have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. 9.4% were born in a foreign country. 12.3% speak a language other than English at home, and out of that percentage the number that speak Hebrew at home is 10.1%. The median household income in 1999 was $103,229, and 2.7% of individuals were below the poverty line.

==Faith communities==
Merion Station has a comparatively large Jewish population and serves as home to Temple Adath Israel of the Main Line, a Conservative Jewish congregation. Its Orthodox Jewish population is served by Lower Merion Synagogue on Old Lancaster Road, Aish HaTorah on Montgomery Avenue, Young Israel of the Main Line on Montgomery Avenue, and the Chabad Center of the Main Line, located in the former General Wayne Inn on Montgomery Avenue. Reform Jews in Merion are likely to travel a mile west up Montgomery Avenue to Main Line Reform Temple-Beth Elohim, to Gladwyne&#x27;s Beth David Congregation, or to Congregation Rodeph Shalom on North Broad Street in Center City.

==Shopping==
The main commercial area of Merion Station is located along Montgomery Avenue east and west of its intersection with Old Lancaster Road and extends into neighboring Bala Cynwyd, officially known as the Merion-Cynwyd Commercial District. It includes restaurants, gift shops and other stores, and local landmarks more than a half century old whose reputations extend well beyond Merion Station&#x27;s limits, notably Hymie&#x27;s Merion Delicatessen, The Tavern Restaurant, Murray&#x27;s Delicatessen, Babis&#x27;s Pharmacy, Bob Wark&#x27;s Liberty Service Station, and the Township Cleaners.

==Hospitals ==
Merion Station is served by Lankenau Medical Center, which is part of the larger Main Line Health System that includes Bryn Mawr Hospital and Paoli Hospital. Lankenau, on Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30) in nearby Wynnewood near the Overbrook border, has traditionally been affiliated with either Jefferson or Hahnemann (now Drexel) colleges of medicine and is always (with Bryn Mawr and Paoli) on the list of the nation&#x27;s top community hospitals. The Lankenau Hospital campus includes affiliated doctors&#x27; office and medical services in Medical Building East, Medical Build West and Saunders House, a rehabilitation facility, is located adjacent to Lankenau Hospital.

==Neighborhoods==
The community north of Montgomery Avenue surrounding General Wayne Park is usually referred to as Merion Park and is in the same zipcode as Merion Station. It was built by developer Ralph Madway decades after the closing of the General Wayne Racetrack that once drew thousands of spectators to Merion for horse races on the green now the Park&#x27;s grounds and bounded by Maplewood and Revere Roads.

<text>Aistulf (also Ahistulf, Aistulfus, Haistulfus, Astolf etc.; ; died December 756) was the Duke of Friuli from 744, King of the Lombards from 749, and Duke of Spoleto from 751. His reign was characterized by ruthless and ambitious efforts to conquer Roman territory to the extent that in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, he is described as a &quot;shameless&quot; Lombard given to &quot;pernicious savagery&quot; and cruelty.

==Biography==
Aistulf was born as the son of Duke Pemmo of Friuli and his wife Ratperga.

After his brother Ratchis became king, Aistulf succeeded him as Duke of Friuli and later succeeded him as king, when Ratchis was forced to abdicate the throne. Ratchis entered a monastery thereafter. While Ratchis had been more tolerant with the Roman element of the Italian population, Aistulf followed a more aggressive policy of expansion and raids against the Papal States and the Eastern Roman exarchate of Ravenna. In 750, Aistulf captured Ravenna and all the provinces subject to the Exarchate, even declaring himself king of the Romans. He also held court in the former palace of the Exarch, where historian Peter Brown asserts, that as a good western Catholic, Aistulf likely offered gifts &quot;on the altar of San Vitale.&quot; With the Lombard king close, Rome was under threat and if the city and its Patriarch were to survive, Brown adds, &quot;they had to look for new protectors.&quot; Recognizing the religious authority of Pope Stephen II, Aistulf offered peace to the pontiff but under Lombard hegemony. In the late spring or summer 751, Aistulf placed Spoleto under his direct control without naming a replacement duke.

Having declared himself the new king of the Romans, Aistulf believed that the empire&#x27;s former supremacy in Italy was now extinct; as a result, the Roman Pope Stephen was unable to exercise the same pastoral diplomacy that his predecessor, Pope Zachary, had over both Liutprand and Ratchis. At Ravenna, Aistulf demanded tribute from the Roman duchy itself, straining papal coffers and greatly worrying Pope Stephen enough that he began negotiations with the Franks.

Aistulf&#x27;s demands were causing consternation in Rome. In 753, Pope Stephen II crossed the Alps and wintered with the Franks, again petitioning them for assistance against Aistulf&#x27;s Lombards. Returning from a summer campaign against the Saxons, the Frankish leader, Pepin the Short, learned that the pontiff—accompanied by a large following and bearing gifts—was traveling north to meet with him. While Pope Stephen&#x27;s arrival in Francia was noteworthy, it was near concomitant with that of Pepin&#x27;s brother, Carloman, who had incidentally come to Francia under pressure from the Lombard king, Aistulf, to explicitly dissuade Pepin from entering Italy.

Carloman&#x27;s effort to deter his brother from pursuing Aistulf proved unsuccessful and Pepin, who was accompanied by Pope Stephen, left Francia for Italy during the summer of 754; the ailing Carloman joined them on their journey but died on the way. Pope Stephen had further ingratiated Pepin to his cause by bestowing the title &quot;Patrician of the Romans&quot; onto him and his son, which proved sufficient to elicit Frankish aide and opposition to Aistulf&#x27;s claims of sovereignty over the Roman empire. Pepin then sent demands to Aistulf for him submit to the patrimony of St. Peter, which meant relinquishing his gains; the Lombard king refused Pepin&#x27;s demands, thus beginning a Frankish military incursion into Italy.

In the spring of 755, the newly anointed Pepin crossed the Alps at the head of his army, putting the Lombards to flight and forcing Aistulf&#x27;s hand in returning papal lands and those belonging to the wider Roman &quot;res publica&quot; that he had occupied. While a treaty was signed between Aistulf and Pepin after the Franks laid siege to Pavia, which included the return of Roman lands and a lasting peace, Aistulf was not long in breaking the treaty once Pepin left Italy. After the Frankish army was back across the Alps, Aistulf besieged Rome again in 756, engendering another plea from the papacy. It read:

I, the Apostle Peter...who adopted you as my sons...and who chose you Franks above all other peoples...I hereby urge and exhort you...to protect my flock...defend Rome, and your brothers the Romans, from the heinous Lombards!...Come, come, in the name of the one living and true God, I beseech you, come and help before the spring of life from which you drink and in which you are reborn dries up, before the last spark of the sacred flame which illuminates you dies out, and before your spiritual mother, God’s holy Church...is desecrated.&quot;

Once he heard the anxious pleas from the pope, Pepin marched his Frankish army back into Italy, again defeated the Lombards and forced Aistulf to surrender, but this time the Franks directly supervised the land returns. In the midst of these negotiations, a Byzantine ambassador was sent to Pepin with imperial claims over the liberated provinces—part of an attempt to substitute Lombard suzerainty for Byzantine domination—but Pepin refused such offers, allowing the Roman West to retain some autonomy as the Frankish king thought only of the Papacy. Meanwhile, Pepin imposed an annual tribute be paid by the Lombards to the Franks, which historian Paolo Delogu labels nothing less than &quot;political subjection.&quot; Despite this blow to Aistulf&#x27;s prestige, the Lombard kingdom remained more or less intact and as Delogu observes, &quot;the political and military alliance between the Franks and the papacy was not solid enough to allow the latter to act very effectively against the Lombards.&quot; When Aistulf died in 756—killed during a hunting accident—his succession was not without controversy when the ex-king Ratchis emerged from his monastery with the intention to reascend to the throne, but the ambitious Desiderius (duke of Tuscany), gained both Frankish and papal support and replaced Aistulf as king of the Lombards in March 757. 

Aistulf was buried in the church of San Marino in Pavia, which he founded.

<text>Dorothea Brande (1892–1948) was an American writer and editor in New York City.

==Biography==
She was born in Chicago on 12 January 1892 as Alice Dorothea Alden Thompson. In 1916 she married fellow Chicago newspaper reporter Herbert Brande and divorced sometime before 1930.

She attended the University of Chicago, the Lewis Institute in Chicago (later merged with Armour Institute of Technology to become Illinois Institute of Technology), and the University of Michigan where she earned her Phi Beta Kappa.

Her book &quot;Becoming a Writer&quot;, published in 1934, is still in print and offers advice for beginning and sustaining any writing enterprise. It has been widely praised by many writers. She also wrote &quot;Wake Up and Live&quot;, published in 1936, which sold more than a million copies. It was used as the inspiration for the comedy film &quot;Wake Up and Live&quot; in 1937.

While she was serving as associate editor of &quot;The American Review&quot; in 1936, she married that journal&#x27;s owner and editor, Seward Collins. Collins also served as the managing editor of &quot;The Bookman&quot;. Collins was a prominent literary figure in New York and a proponent of an American version of fascism.

Dorothea Collins (Dorothea Brande) died in Boston on 17 December 1948.

She did “Wake Up and Live” as a lecture several years ago more for a lark than anything else and to break her shyness over public speaking. It took on and she repeated it several times. Then she was asked to put it into a book. Five publishers turned it down before one accepted it. When it reached its 50,000 sale they gave her a $1,000 watch. The movies paid her $25,000 just to use the title. And any publisher would grab at anything she turns out.&quot;

She declares that She would rather do four books than one short story. At the moment she is starting a new course of lectures on writing which she will give in New York City and making ready for others in the field. Her real problem, she said wistfully, is what to do in her spare time. Knitting isn&#x27;t the answer because she already includes that in her curriculum, finding it an excellent way of thinking out her writing.&quot; - NOTE - This is an interesting contemporary entry from 1937, as only &#x27;My Invincible Aunt&quot; seems to have been published?

Influence of &#x27;Becoming a Writer&#x27; on author Ray Bradbury

A personal account of how Dorothea Brande had introduced an author to allow him to get his book published.

AND this description from &#x27;Poets &amp; People by Charles Norman&#x27;: &quot;Dorothea was in her middle thirties when I met her. She looked like a heroine in a middle western novel — hair in a knot, but wisps of it blowing about, and more feminine than elegant in her choice of clothes. A few years later some disorder transformed her into a mountain of flesh; then, unable to move about, she stayed in her apartment overlooking the Queensborough Bridge, where she read manuscripts and worked on a book which turned out to be an enormous bestseller. It was called Wake Up and Live.&quot;

<text>Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a means of visualizing the level of similarity of individual cases of a data set. MDS is used to translate distances between each pair of formula_1 objects in a set into a configuration of formula_1 points mapped into an abstract Cartesian space.

More technically, MDS refers to a set of related ordination techniques used in information visualization, in particular to display the information contained in a distance matrix. It is a form of non-linear dimensionality reduction.

Given a distance matrix with the distances between each pair of objects in a set, and a chosen number of dimensions, &quot;N&quot;, an MDS algorithm places each object into &quot;N&quot;-dimensional space (a lower-dimensional representation) such that the between-object distances are preserved as well as possible. For &quot;N&quot; = 1, 2, and 3, the resulting points can be visualized on a scatter plot.

Core theoretical contributions to MDS were made by James O. Ramsay of McGill University, who is also regarded as the founder of functional data analysis.

MDS algorithms fall into a taxonomy, depending on the meaning of the input matrix:

===Classical multidimensional scaling===

It is also known as Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), Torgerson Scaling or Torgerson–Gower scaling. It takes an input matrix giving dissimilarities between pairs of items and outputs a coordinate matrix whose configuration minimizes a loss function called &quot;strain&quot;, which is given by
formula_3 
where formula_4 denote vectors in &quot;N&quot;-dimensional space, formula_5 denotes the scalar product between formula_4 and formula_7, and formula_8 are the elements of the matrix formula_9 defined on step 2 of the following algorithm, which are computed from the distances.

: Steps of a Classical MDS algorithm: 
: Classical MDS uses the fact that the coordinate matrix formula_10 can be derived by eigenvalue decomposition from formula_11. And the matrix formula_12 can be computed from proximity matrix formula_13 by using double centering.
:# Set up the squared proximity matrix formula_14
:# Apply double centering: formula_15 using the centering matrix formula_16, where formula_17 is the number of objects, formula_18 is the formula_19 identity matrix, and formula_20 is an formula_21 matrix of all ones.
:# Determine the formula_22 largest eigenvalues formula_23 and corresponding eigenvectors formula_24 of formula_12 (where formula_22 is the number of dimensions desired for the output).
:# Now, formula_27 , where formula_28 is the matrix of formula_22 eigenvectors and formula_30 is the diagonal matrix of formula_22 eigenvalues of formula_12.
:Classical MDS assumes metric distances. So this is not applicable for direct dissimilarity ratings.

=== Metric multidimensional scaling (mMDS) ===

It is a superset of classical MDS that generalizes the optimization procedure to a variety of loss functions and input matrices of known distances with weights and so on. A useful loss function in this context is called &quot;stress&quot;, which is often minimized using a procedure called stress majorization. Metric MDS minimizes the cost function called “stress” which is a residual sum of squares:formula_33
Metric scaling uses a power transformation with a user-controlled exponent formula_34: formula_35 and formula_36 for distance. In classical scaling formula_37 Non-metric scaling is defined by the use of isotonic regression to nonparametrically estimate a transformation of the dissimilarities.

===Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)===

In contrast to metric MDS, non-metric MDS finds both a non-parametric monotonic relationship between the dissimilarities in the item-item matrix and the Euclidean distances between items, and the location of each item in the low-dimensional space. 

Let formula_38 be the dissimilarity between points formula_39. Let formula_40 be the Euclidean distance between embedded points formula_41.

Now, for each choice of the embedded points formula_42 and is a monotonically increasing function formula_43, define the &quot;stress&quot; function:
:formula_44
The factor of formula_45 in the denominator is necessary to prevent a &quot;collapse&quot;. Suppose we define instead formula_46, then it can be trivially minimized by setting formula_47, then collapse every point to the same point.

A few variants of this cost function exist. MDS programs automatically minimize stress in order to obtain the MDS solution.

The core of a non-metric MDS algorithm is a twofold optimization process. First the optimal monotonic transformation of the proximities has to be found. Secondly, the points of a configuration have to be optimally arranged, so that their distances match the scaled proximities as closely as possible. 

NMDS needs to optimize two objectives simultaneously. This is usually done iteratively:
:# Initialize formula_42 randomly, e. g. by sampling from a normal distribution. 
:# Do until a stopping criterion (for example, formula_49)
:## Solve for formula_50 by isotonic regression. 
:## Solve for formula_51 by gradient descent or other methods. 
:#Return formula_42 and formula_43 
Louis Guttman&#x27;s smallest space analysis (SSA) is an example of a non-metric MDS procedure.

===Generalized multidimensional scaling (GMD)===

An extension of metric multidimensional scaling, in which the target space is an arbitrary smooth non-Euclidean space. In cases where the dissimilarities are distances on a surface and the target space is another surface, GMDS allows finding the minimum-distortion embedding of one surface into another.

==Details==

The data to be analyzed is a collection of formula_54 objects (colors, faces, stocks, . . .) on which a &quot;distance function&quot; is defined,

:formula_55 distance between formula_56-th and formula_57-th objects.

These distances are the entries of the &quot;dissimilarity matrix&quot;

:formula_58

The goal of MDS is, given formula_59, to find formula_54 vectors 
formula_61 such that

:formula_62 for all formula_63,

where formula_64 is a vector norm. In classical MDS, this norm is the Euclidean distance, but, in a broader sense, it may be a metric or arbitrary distance function. For example, when dealing with mixed-type data that contain numerical as well as categorical descriptors, Gower&#x27;s distance is a common alternative.

In other words, MDS attempts to find a mapping from the formula_54 objects into formula_66 such that distances are preserved. If the dimension formula_67 is chosen to be 2 or 3, we may plot the vectors formula_42 to obtain a visualization of the similarities between the formula_54 objects. Note that the vectors formula_42 are not unique: With the Euclidean distance, they may be arbitrarily translated, rotated, and reflected, since these transformations do not change the pairwise distances formula_71.

(Note: The symbol formula_72 indicates the set of real numbers, and the notation formula_66 refers to the Cartesian product of formula_67 copies of formula_72, which is an formula_67-dimensional vector space over the field of the real numbers.)

There are various approaches to determining the vectors formula_42. Usually, MDS is formulated as an optimization problem, where formula_78 is found as a minimizer of some cost function, for example,

:formula_79

A solution may then be found by numerical optimization techniques. For some particularly chosen cost functions, minimizers can be stated analytically in terms of matrix eigendecompositions.

==Procedure==
There are several steps in conducting MDS research:
# Formulating the problem – What variables do you want to compare? How many variables do you want to compare? What purpose is the study to be used for?
# Obtaining input data – For example, :- Respondents are asked a series of questions. For each product pair, they are asked to rate similarity (usually on a 7-point Likert scale from very similar to very dissimilar). The first question could be for Coke/Pepsi for example, the next for Coke/Hires rootbeer, the next for Pepsi/Dr Pepper, the next for Dr Pepper/Hires rootbeer, etc. The number of questions is a function of the number of brands and can be calculated as formula_80 where &quot;Q&quot; is the number of questions and &quot;N&quot; is the number of brands. This approach is referred to as the “Perception data : direct approach”. There are two other approaches. There is the “Perception data : derived approach” in which products are decomposed into attributes that are rated on a semantic differential scale. The other is the “Preference data approach” in which respondents are asked their preference rather than similarity.
# Running the MDS statistical program – Software for running the procedure is available in many statistical software packages. Often there is a choice between Metric MDS (which deals with interval or ratio level data), and Nonmetric MDS (which deals with ordinal data).
# Decide number of dimensions – The researcher must decide on the number of dimensions they want the computer to create. Interpretability of the MDS solution is often important, and lower dimensional solutions will typically be easier to interpret and visualize. However, dimension selection is also an issue of balancing underfitting and overfitting. Lower dimensional solutions may underfit by leaving out important dimensions of the dissimilarity data. Higher dimensional solutions may overfit to noise in the dissimilarity measurements. Model selection tools like AIC, BIC, Bayes factors, or cross-validation can thus be useful to select the dimensionality that balances underfitting and overfitting.
# Mapping the results and defining the dimensions – The statistical program (or a related module) will map the results. The map will plot each product (usually in two-dimensional space). The proximity of products to each other indicate either how similar they are or how preferred they are, depending on which approach was used. How the dimensions of the embedding actually correspond to dimensions of system behavior, however, are not necessarily obvious. Here, a subjective judgment about the correspondence can be made (see perceptual mapping).
# Test the results for reliability and validity – Compute R-squared to determine what proportion of variance of the scaled data can be accounted for by the MDS procedure. An R-square of 0.6 is considered the minimum acceptable level. An R-square of 0.8 is considered good for metric scaling and .9 is considered good for non-metric scaling. Other possible tests are Kruskal’s Stress, split data tests, data stability tests (i.e., eliminating one brand), and test-retest reliability.
# Report the results comprehensively – Along with the mapping, at least distance measure (e.g., Sorenson index, Jaccard index) and reliability (e.g., stress value) should be given. It is also very advisable to give the algorithm (e.g., Kruskal, Mather), which is often defined by the program used (sometimes replacing the algorithm report), if you have given a start configuration or had a random choice, the number of runs, the assessment of dimensionality, the Monte Carlo method results, the number of iterations, the assessment of stability, and the proportional variance of each axis (r-square).

<doc id="398791" wikidata="Q5500691" url="?curid=398791" title="Freedom from Torture">
<text>Freedom from Torture (previously known as The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture) is a British registered charity that provides therapeutic care for survivors of torture who seek protection in the UK. Since it was established in 1985, more than 57,000 survivors of torture have been referred to the organisation for help and it is one of the world’s largest torture treatment centres.

Freedom from Torture provides medical and psychological documentation of torture, a range of rehabilitation therapies, including psychotherapy, individual and family counselling, physiotherapy and complementary group work as well as practical advice and support. It trains health, legal and policy professionals throughout the UK to work with the complex needs and rights of torture survivors.

A key area of Freedom from Torture&#x27;s work is to advocate for torture survivors and to ensure states responsible for torture are held accountable. It works to guarantee the human rights of survivors nationally and internationally. Freedom from Torture also supports Survivors Speak OUT (SSO), the UK&#x27;s only torture survivor-led activist network. All members are former Freedom from Torture clients.

== History ==
Freedom from Torture began in the early 1980s, as part of the Medical Group of Amnesty International. The organisation was set up to improve existing health services for torture survivors in the UK. This work initially took the form of campaigns against violations of human rights and the documentation of evidence of torture by volunteer health professionals and senior medical specialists as a reaction .

In 1985, under the leadership of Helen Bamber, the organisation was established as a registered charity. It provided medical treatment, counselling and therapy to torture survivors and documented evidence of torture using the Istanbul Protocol. Sponsorship came from the heads of the Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Psychiatrists and Royal College of Surgeons of England.

It worked at first in two rooms in the former National Temperance Hospital, off Hampstead Road in north-west London. By 1990, the organisation was treating 750 clients and then moved to a building in Grafton Road, Kentish Town.

The organisation began a regional programme in late 2003 with the opening of a centre in Manchester, treating clients living in the north-west. This followed the government&#x27;s dispersal scheme, which saw asylum seekers relocated outside London.

In 2004, the London headquarters moved into a £5.8m treatment centre in Isledon Road, Finsbury Park. The building was purpose-built by architect Paul Hyett. Freedom from Torture’s Scotland centre opened in Glasgow in 2004, followed by the Newcastle centre in 2006 and the Birmingham centre in 2009. These regional centres were opened to treat torture survivors who had been dispersed outside London.

Freedom from Torture&#x27;s chief executive is Sonya Sceats.

== Treatment provided ==
Freedom from Torture provides a range of services for its clients. These include medical consultation, examination and forensic documentation of injuries through medico-legal reports, psychological and physical treatment and support, and practical help.

The organisation employs more than 156 staff and 140 volunteers across its five centres in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and Glasgow. These include medical doctors, caseworkers, counsellors, legal advisers, physiotherapists, psychotherapists, psychologists, interpreters, child and family therapists and group workers.

== Statistics ==
Since its founding in 1985, the organisation has received more than 57,000 referrals.

Freedom from Torture&#x27;s team of clinical staff apply international standards for documenting torture in these assessments.

== Funding ==
Freedom from Torture is an independent registered charity. According to the organization&#x27;s Annual Report 2015, they rely on donations from individuals for almost three quarters of their funding. They raise income using a variety of methods and from a variety of sources.

<text>The list of presidents of the Government of Catalonia compiles the official list of presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya since its inception in 1359 to present time. It has been the traditional way of listing presidents, starting with Berenguer de Cruïlles. The most recent stable version of the list dates from 2003, by Josep M. Solé i Sabaté in his work &quot;Historia de la Generalitat de Catalunya i dels seus presidents&quot;. The procedure to set up this list is the following: for the period of the medieval Generalitat (Deputation of the General), the president was the most eminent ecclesiastic deputy of the Deputation of the General of Catalonia (popularly known as Generalitat), a body of the Catalan Courts dissolved in 1716 and reinstated for two years in 1874. From April 1931 on, the list includes the elected presidents as well as the proclaimed exiled presidents during the Francoist dictatorship. The functions of the President of the Government of Catalonia have varied considerably over history, in parallel with the attributions of the Generalitat itself.

== Deputation of the General or &quot;Generalitat&quot; (1359–1716) ==

=== Fourteenth century ===
Here follows a list of representatives of Catalan institutions through the ages. The Presidents as such first appeared with the modern Generalitat in the 20th century.

<text>Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst (12 November 1755 – 28 June 1813) was a Hanoverian-born general in Prussian service from 1801. As the first Chief of the Prussian General Staff, he was noted for his military theories, his reforms of the Prussian army, and his leadership during the Napoleonic Wars. Scharnhorst limited the use of corporal punishments, established promotion for merit, abolished the enrollment of foreigners, began the organization of a reserve army, and organized and simplified the military administration.

==Life and career==
Born at Bordenau (now a part of Neustadt am Rübenberge, Lower Saxony) near Hanover, into a minor landowning family, Scharnhorst succeeded in educating himself and in securing admission to the military academy of William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe, at the Wilhelmstein fortress. In 1778 he received a commission into the Hanoverian service. He employed the intervals of regimental duty in further self-education and literary work. In 1783 he transferred to the artillery and received an appointment to the new artillery school in Hanover. He had already founded a military journal which, under a series of names, endured until 1805, and in 1788 he designed, and in part published, a &quot;Handbook for Officers in the Applied Sections of Military Science&quot; (&quot;Handbuch für Offiziere in den anwendbaren Teilen der Kriegswissenschaften&quot;). He also published in 1792 his &quot;Military Handbook for Use in the Field&quot; (&quot;Militärisches Taschenbuch für den Gebrauch im Felde&quot;).

The income he derived from his writings provided Scharnhorst&#x27;s chief means of support, for he still held the rank of lieutenant, and though the farm of Bordenau produced a small sum annually, he had a wife, Clara Schmalz (a sister of Theodor Schmalz, the first director of Berlin University) and family to maintain. 

His first military campaign took place in 1793 in the Netherlands, in which he served with distinction under the Duke of York. In 1794 he took part in the defence of Menen and commemorated the escape of the garrison in his &quot;Defence of the Town of Menen&quot; (&quot;Verteidigung der Stadt Menin&quot;, Hanover, 1803), which, apart from his paper on &quot;The Origins of the Good Fortune of the French in the Revolutionary War&quot; (&quot;Die Ursachen des Glücks der Franzosen im Revolutionskrieg&quot;) remains his best-known work. Shortly thereafter he received promotion to the rank of major and joined the staff of the Hanoverian contingent.

After the Peace of Basel (5 March 1795) Scharnhorst returned to Hanover. He had by now become so well known to the armies of the various allied states that he received invitations from several of them to transfer his services. In January 1797, he turned down an invitation to join the Prussian Army when Hanover offered a promotion to lieutenent colonel and a raise in pay. In 1801 the Prussian offer was made again, at twice his pay from Hanover, and this time Scharnhorst accepted, on the condition that he retain his seniority, was provided with a good pension, and received a patent of nobility. He thus engaged himself to King Frederick William III of Prussia. 

The Prussian Military Academy employed him, almost as a matter of course, in important instructional work (Clausewitz was one of his students) and he founded the Berlin Military Society. In the mobilizations and precautionary measures that marked the years 1804 and 1805, and in the war of 1806 that ensued, Scharnhorst served as chief of the general staff (lieutenant-quartermaster) of the Duke of Brunswick, received a slight wound at Auerstedt (14 October 1806) and distinguished himself by his stern resolution during the retreat of the Prussian army. He attached himself to Blücher in the last stages of the disastrous campaign, went into captivity with him at the capitulation of Ratekau (7 November 1806), and, quickly exchanged, had a prominent and almost decisive part in leading L&#x27;Estocq&#x27;s Prussian corps, which served with the Russians. For his services at Eylau (February 1807) he received the highest Prussian military order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;.

It was apparent that Scharnhorst&#x27;s skills exceeded those of a merely brilliant staff officer. Educated in the traditions of the Seven Years&#x27; War, he had by degrees, as his experience widened, divested his mind of antiquated forms of war, and realised that only a &quot;national&quot; army and a policy of fighting decisive battles could give an adequate response to the political and strategic situation brought about by the French Revolution. He was promoted to major-general a few days after the Peace of Tilsit (July 1807), and became the head of a reform commission that included the best of the younger officers, such as Gneisenau, Grolman, and Boyen. Stein himself became a member of the commission and secured Scharnhorst free access to King Frederick William III by securing his appointment as &quot;aide-de-camp-general&quot;. But Napoleon quickly became suspicious, and Frederick William repeatedly had to suspend or cancel the reforms recommended.

By slow and labored steps, Scharnhorst converted the professional long-service army of Prussia, wrecked at Jena (1806), into a national army based on universal service. Universal service was not secured until his death, but he laid down the principles and prepared the way for its adoption. Enrollments of foreigners were abolished, corporal punishments were limited to flagrant cases of insubordination, promotion for merit was established, and the military administration organized and simplified. The organization of the &quot;Landwehr&quot; (army reserves) was begun.

In 1809, the war between France and Austria roused premature hopes in the patriots&#x27; party, which the conqueror did not fail to note. By direct application to Napoleon, Scharnhorst evaded the decree of 26 September 1810, which required all foreigners to leave the Prussian service forthwith, but when in 1811–1812 France forced Prussia into an alliance against Russia and Prussia despatched an auxiliary army to serve under Napoleon&#x27;s orders, Scharnhorst left Berlin on unlimited leave of absence. In retirement he wrote and published a work on firearms, &quot;Über die Wirkung des Feuergewehrs&quot; (1813). But the retreat from Moscow (1812) at last sounded the call to arms for the new national army of Prussia.

Scharnhorst, recalled to the king&#x27;s headquarters, refused a higher post but became chief of staff to Blücher, in whose vigour, energy, and influence with the young soldiers he had complete confidence. Russian Prince Wittgenstein was so impressed by Scharnhorst that he asked to borrow him temporarily as his chief of staff, and Blücher agreed. In the first battle, Lützen or Gross-Görschen (2 May 1813), Prussia suffered defeat, but a very different defeat from those Napoleon had inflicted before. The French army, largely made up of teenage conscripts by 1813 and no longer the juggernaut military it once was in before 1807, suffered significant casualties and, due in part to a severe shortage of cavalry, failed to follow up, rendering it an incomplete victory. In this battle, Scharnhorst received a wound in the foot, not in itself grave, but soon made mortal by the fatigues of the retreat to Dresden, and he succumbed to it on 28 June 1813 at Prague, where he had travelled to negotiate with Schwarzenberg and Radetzky for the armed intervention of Austria. Shortly before his death he had received promotion to the rank of lieutenant-general. Frederick William III erected a statue in his memory, by Christian Daniel Rauch, in Berlin. Scharnhorst was buried at the Invalidenfriedhof Cemetery in Berlin.

== Legacy ==
Scharnhorst became the namesake for several objects, places and groups:

* SMS &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, a 1906 German armored cruiser during World War I.
* &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, a 1936 German battleship during World War II and lead ship of the , which also included the &quot;Gneisenau&quot;.
* Infantry Division Scharnhorst, a 1945 German infantry division and one of the last new Wehrmacht formations of World War II.
* Scharnhorst Order, highest military order of the former East German National People&#x27;s Army (NVA).
* &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; (F 213), a 1943 British sloop, initially known as HMS &quot;Mermaid&quot;, transferred to West Germany in 1959.
* Many streets in German cities, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, and Cologne, among others.

General Hans von Seeckt has been compared to Scharnhorst, mainly for his part in preparing the German Army of the Weimar Republic, which was severely limited by the Treaty of Versailles, for its eventual rearming, adapting secret doctrines, and preparing a General Staff. He has been credited with their unparalleled success in the campaigns of 1939-1940. After the rise of the Nazis in Germany, Field Marshal August von Mackensen compared von Seeckt to Scharnhorst, saying &quot;The old fire burnt still, and the Allied Control had not destroyed any of the lasting elements of German strength.&quot; Winston Churchill also subscribed to this theory, believing von Seeckt was vital in the return of Germany to its place in the military world as rapidly as it had.

<doc id="398809" wikidata="Q7738320" url="?curid=398809" title="The Gripping Hand">
<text>The Gripping Hand is a science fiction novel by American writers Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, published in 1993. A sequel to their 1974 work &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;The Gripping Hand&quot; is, chronologically, the last novel to be set in the CoDominium universe (though in 2010 Pournelle&#x27;s daughter Jennifer published an authorized sequel entitled &quot;Outies&quot;). In the United Kingdom, it was released as The Moat around Murcheson&#x27;s Eye (sometimes misspelled &quot;The Mote around Murchison&#x27;s Eye&quot;).

&quot;The Gripping Hand&quot; is set in the year 3046 (twenty-eight years after the events of &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;) and revolves primarily around two characters of the first book, Captain Sir Kevin Renner (ISN, Reserve) and His Excellency Horace Bury, Imperial Trader Magnate. It also resolves many of the conflicts and tension remaining from the preceding novel, but much of the plot cannot be understood without reading &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

==Plot==

At the end of &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;, Renner and Bury are secretly enlisted into Imperial Naval Intelligence. Neither is happy about the arrangement at first, but they spend the next twenty-five years effectively preventing rebellions against the Empire so that the Imperial Navy can concentrate on blockading the Moties in their star system. 

While investigating suspicious economic activity on the planet Maxroy&#x27;s Purchase, Renner and Bury encounter wide idiomatic usage of the phrase &quot;...on the gripping hand&quot;. The source of the phrase turns out to be innocuous enough — the governor picked up the expression as a crewman on INSS &quot;MacArthur&quot; on the expedition to Mote Prime — but the memories dredged up are too much for Bury. Driven by nightmares and a deep-seated fear for humanity&#x27;s safety, Bury must confirm that the Empire is safe from the Moties. Renner and Bury travel to Sparta, the Imperial capital planet, to obtain permission to inspect the blockade.

In &quot;Mote&quot;, it is mentioned that a protostar is forming in the Coalsack Nebula. The Moties had studied it extensively and fooled Jacob Buckman, the astrophysicist on the only expedition to the Motie system, into believing that it would ignite in about 1,000 years. Bury and Renner discover, much to their horror, that the object is due to collapse and ignite much sooner. The newborn star will create one or more new Alderson Points for interstellar travel, giving the Moties another usable exit from their system. The sole currently existing Alderson Point leads to the photosphere of the supergiant red star Murcheson&#x27;s Eye, which made the blockade much more practical.

Armed with this alarming knowledge and carrying influential passengers, Renner and Bury depart aboard Bury&#x27;s ship &quot;Sinbad&quot; for New Caledonia, the closest human system to the Mote. There the Imperial Commission decides that ships must be sent to the hitherto ignored star system where the only dangerous Alderson Point will appear. All that can be sent on such short notice are two Imperial warships and &quot;Sinbad&quot;. 

They arrive — just in time to observe seven unarmed Motie ships emerge from the new Alderson Point. The Moties scatter, and three human ships cannot possibly capture all of them, though they can block the exit. Renner and Bury decide they have no choice but to accept a Mediator&#x27;s invitation to return with her to the Motie system. 

The second half of &quot;The Gripping Hand&quot; is a tale of shifting alliances involving many Motie factions, diplomacy and space combat. With the aid of the grownup offspring of Lord and Lady Blaine, raised in the company of Mediators brought back by the first expedition, Bury and Renner fight to save the Empire. Key to their strategy is a genetically altered parasite developed by the Blaines&#x27; research institute. It limits the excessive reproduction rate that has condemned the Moties to Cycles of overpopulation, followed inevitably by war and the collapse of civilization. Two alliances coalesce, one in favor of peaceful co-existence with humans and another determined to escape the Motie system at any cost. The pro-human faction wins.

==Reception==
James Nicoll considered the novel to be an &quot;utterly unnecessary sequel&quot;, &quot;unmemorable&quot;, and &quot;rather dull&quot;, with &quot;[t]oo much irrelevant wheel spinning&quot;; Nicoll also singled out &quot;the entire Maxroy’s Purchase subplot&quot; as superfluous. 

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described it as &quot;perfectly adequate [but] largely irrelevant&quot;, noting that &quot;the first third of the book drags&quot; and that Niven and Pournelle &quot;don&#x27;t explore [the book&#x27;s themes and subtexts] deeply enough.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it &quot;sometimes slow-paced and talky&quot;, but felt that readers would not be disappointed, and predicted that the book would be a finalist for the Hugo Award for Best Novel.

==Background==
In his 1991 collection &quot;Playgrounds of the Mind&quot;, Niven stated that he and Pournelle were contractually forbidden from collaborating on any projects until they had completed a sequel to &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

<text>Margaret Eleanor Whiting (July 22, 1924 – January 10, 2011) was an American singer of popular music and country music who gained popularity in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Whiting was born in Detroit. Her family moved to Los Angeles in 1929, when she was five years old. Her father, Richard, was a composer of popular songs, including the classics &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t We Got Fun?&quot;, and &quot;On the Good Ship Lollipop&quot;. Her sister, Barbara Whiting, was an actress (&quot;Junior Miss&quot;, &quot;Beware, My Lovely&quot;) and singer.

An aunt, Margaret Young, was a singer and popular recording artist in the 1920s. Whiting&#x27;s singing ability was noticed at an early age and at seven she sang for singer-lyricist Johnny Mercer, with whom her father had collaborated on some popular songs, including &quot;Too Marvelous for Words&quot;. In 1942, Mercer co-founded Capitol Records and signed Margaret to one of Capitol&#x27;s first recording contracts.

===Recording career===
Whiting&#x27;s first recordings were as featured singer with various orchestras. In 1944, her version of &quot;Moonlight in Vermont&quot;, with Billy Butterfield&#x27;s Orchestra, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.
Other recordings included &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot;, with Freddie Slack and His Orchestra (1942) and &quot;It Might as Well Be Spring&quot;, with Paul Weston and His Orchestra (1945).

In 1945, Whiting began to record under her own name. &quot;A Tree in the Meadow&quot; was a number one hit in the summer of 1948, and her duet with country music star Jimmy Wakely, &quot;Slippin&#x27; Around&quot;, was another number one hit in 1949. It sold 1.75 million copies, and Whiting was titled &quot;Queen of the Jukeboxes&quot;. Other recordings include:
*&quot;All Through the Day&quot; (1945, becoming a bestseller in the spring of 1946)
*&quot;In Love in Vain&quot; (1945)
:(these two from the movie &quot;Centennial Summer&quot;)
*&quot;Guilty&quot; (1946)
*&quot;Pretending&quot; (1946)
*&quot;Oh, But I Do&quot; (1946)
*&quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; (duet with Johnny Mercer, 1949)
*&quot;Blind Date&quot;, a novelty record with Bob Hope (1950)
*&quot;Far Away Places&quot; (1949)
*&quot;Silver Bells&quot; (duet with Jimmy Wakely, 1951)

Until the mid-1950s Whiting continued to record for Capitol, but as she ceased to record songs that charted as hits, she switched to Dot Records in 1957 and to Verve Records in 1960. Whiting returned to Capitol in the early 1960s and then signed with London Records in 1966. On London, Whiting landed one last major hit single in 1966, &quot;The Wheel of Hurt&quot;, which hit No. 1 on the Easy Listening singles chart. Her final solo albums were made for Audiophile (1980, 1982, 1985) and DRG Records (1991). Her distinguished conductors and musical arrangers through the years included Buddy Bregman, Frank DeVol, Russell Garcia, Johnny Mandel, Billy May, Marty Paich, Nelson Riddle, Pete Rugolo, and Paul Weston.

===Radio career===
Whiting co-starred on the 15-minute musical programs &quot;The Jack Smith Show&quot; and &quot;Club Fifteen&quot;. She also was a vocalist on &quot;The Eddie Cantor Show&quot; and was in the cast of &quot;The Philip Morris Follies of 1946&quot; and &quot;The Railroad Hour&quot;. Additionally, she was hostess on the &quot;Spotlight Revue&quot; and a featured singer on the transcribed &quot;Barry Wood Show&quot;. She also appeared in the role of a young Sophie Tucker in the January 13, 1957 &quot;CBS Radio Workshop&quot; presentation of &quot;No Time For Heartaches&quot;.

===Television career===

Margaret and Barbara Whiting starred as themselves in the situation comedy &quot;Those Whiting Girls&quot;. The show, produced by Desilu Productions, aired on CBS as a summer replacement series (in place of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;) between July, 1955 and September, 1957.

Margaret Whiting was a regular guest on variety shows and talk shows throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot;, when the musical series focused on Whiting&#x27;s hometown of Detroit; &quot;The Big Record&quot;, &quot;The Bob Hope Show&quot;, &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Tony Martin Show&quot;, &quot;The David Frost Show&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The George Jessel Show&quot;, &quot;The Guy Mitchell Show&quot;, &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Nat King Cole Show&quot;, &quot;Over Easy&quot;, &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, &quot;The Patti Page Show&quot;, &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, &quot;The Ford Show Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;, &quot;The Texaco Star Theater&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Virginia Graham Show&quot;, and &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot;.

In 1960, Whiting appeared as Vinnie Berkeley in one of the last episodes, &quot;Martial Law&quot;, of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, &quot;Colt .45&quot;. Paul Picerni was cast in the same segment as Duke Blaine.

In 1984, Whiting appeared in the television musical movie &quot;Taking My Turn.&quot; It was basically a filmed version of the 1983 off-Broadway show in which she appeared. This ensemble show also included Marni Nixon, Tiger Haynes, and Cissy Houston among others. The music was composed by Gary William Friedman with lyrics by Will Holt. The revue was centered on issues regarding aging. The stage production opened at New York City&#x27;s Entermedia Theatre on June 9, 1983. It went on to win the 1984 Outer Critic&#x27;s Circle Award for Best Lyrics/Music and was nominated for the 1984 Drama Desk Award for Best Musical (losing to Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sunday In the Park With George&quot;). A cast recording of the stage production was released and subsequently re-released on CD.

In the 2000s, Whiting was interviewed in several documentaries about singers and songwriters of her era, including &quot;Judy Garland: By Myself&quot; (2004), &quot;Fever: The Music of Peggy Lee&quot; (2004), &quot;Anita O&#x27;Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer&quot; (2007), &quot;Johnny Mercer: The Dream&#x27;s on Me&quot; (2009), &quot;The Andrews Sisters: Queens of the Music Machines&quot; (2009) and &quot;Michael Feinstein&#x27;s American Songbook&quot; (2010).

===Cabaret Master Teacher===
From 1989 through 2001, Whiting was the Artistic Director of the annual Cabaret and Performance Conference at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in Waterford Connecticut. With other performers such as Julie Wilson and Anne Francine as well as musical directors like Tex Arnold, she spent 10 days instructing selected professionals and amateurs in the cabaret performance process.

===Marriages===
Whiting was married four times, and had one child:
*Hubbell Robinson Jr., a writer, producer, and television executive (married December 29, 1948 – divorced August 18, 1949)
*Lou Busch, a ragtime pianist known as &quot;Joe &#x27;Fingers&#x27; Carr&quot; (divorced; one daughter, Deborah, born 1950)
*John Richard Moore, a founder of Panavision (married 1958 – divorced) 
*Jack Wrangler (John Stillman), 1970s and 1980s gay pornography film actor (married 1994, when Whiting was 70 and he was 48 – until his death from emphysema April 7, 2009)

<text>Coenraad Jacob Temminck (; 31 March 1778  – 30 January 1858) was a Dutch patrician, zoologist and museum director.

== Biography ==
Coenraad Jacob Temminck was born on 31 March 1778 in Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic. From his father, Jacob Temminck, who was treasurer of the Dutch East India Company with links to numerous travellers and collectors, he inherited a large collection of bird specimens. His father was a good friend of Francois Levaillant who also guided Coenraad.

Temminck&#x27;s &quot;Manuel d&#x27;ornithologie, ou Tableau systématique des oiseaux qui se trouvent en Europe&quot; (1815) was the standard work on European birds for many years. He was also the author of &quot;Histoire naturelle générale des Pigeons et des Gallinacées&quot; (1813–1817), illustrated by Pauline Knip. He wrote &quot;Nouveau Recueil de Planches coloriées d&#x27;Oiseaux&quot; (1820–1839), and contributed to the mammalian sections of Philipp Franz von Siebold&#x27;s &quot;Fauna japonica&quot; (1844–1850).

Temminck was the first director of the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden from 1820 until now. In 1824, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1831, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1836 he became member of the Royal Institute, predecessor of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Temminck, in collaboration with Heinrich Kuhl, is the author of descriptions of parrots, including the rosella &quot;Platycercus icterotis&quot;. A tailless mutant of a junglefowl &quot;Gallus lafayettii&quot; was described in 1807 by Temminck, which in 1868 the English naturalist Charles Darwin incorrectly denied existed. Another junglefowl, described in 1813 by Temminck as &quot;Gallus giganteus&quot; was, he believed, one of six wild ancestral species of domestic fowl; Darwin, however, demonstrated that the latter has a single (monophyletic) origin.

<text>Bernard John Ebbers (August 27, 1941 – February 2, 2020) was a Canadian-American businessman and the co-founder and CEO of WorldCom. Under his management, WorldCom grew rapidly but collapsed in 2002 amid revelations of accounting irregularities, making it at the time one of the largest accounting scandals in the United States. Ebbers blamed his subordinates but was convicted of fraud and conspiracy. In December 2019, Ebbers was released from Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth, due to declining health, having served 13 years of his 25-year sentence, and he died just over a month later.

In 2009, &quot;Condé Nast Portfolio&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; named Ebbers among the worst CEOs in business history.

Dubbed the &quot;Telecom Cowboy,&quot; Ebbers often wore boots and blue jeans instead of the typical corporate uniform of a suit and tie. He also lived on a farm and loved to drive a tractor.

==Early life and education==
Ebbers was born in Edmonton, Alberta, the second of five children of Kathleen and John Ebbers, a traveling salesman. His family were devout Christians.

When Ebbers was young, the family moved to California and later lived for a while on a mission post on a Navajo Nation Indian reservation in New Mexico before moving back to Canada when Ebbers was a teenager.

After high school, Ebbers briefly attended the University of Alberta and Calvin College before enrolling at Mississippi College on a basketball scholarship. Between schools, he worked as a milkman and bouncer. An injury before his senior season prevented him from playing his final year and he was instead assigned to coach the junior varsity team. In 1967, he received a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in physical education, with an academic minor in secondary education, from Mississippi College.

==Career==
Ebbers began his business career operating a chain of motels in Mississippi.

In 1983, following a meeting at a coffee shop in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Murray Waldron wrote a business plan for selling low-cost, long-distance phone service on a napkin. Ebbers and a group of investors raised $650,000 to form Long Distance Discount Services, Inc. In 1985, he was named chief executive officer. The company acquired over 60 telecommunications firms and in 1995, it changed its name to WorldCom.

In 1996, WorldCom acquired MFS Communications (originally Metropolitan Fiber Systems) and in July 1998, it acquired MCI Communications. In July 2000, it abandoned its planned $115 billion acquisition of Sprint Corporation after U.S. and European Union antitrust regulators raised objections.

Between September 2000 and April 2002, the board of directors of Worldcom authorized several loans and loan guarantees to Ebbers so that he would not have to sell his Worldcom shares to meet margin calls as the share price plummeted during the bursting of the dot-com bubble. By April 2002, Ebbers had lost substantial support on the board due to these loans. Additionally, a number of directors believed Ebbers had not charted a way forward after the Sprint merger collapsed. On April 26, Worldcom&#x27;s board voted unanimously to demand that Ebbers resign, which he formally did on April 30, 2002. As part of his departure, his loans were consolidated into a single $408.2 million promissory note. In 2003, Ebbers defaulted on the note and Worldcom foreclosed on many of his assets.

===Awards and accolades===
* Mississippi Business Hall of Fame (May 1995)
* Member of &quot;Wired&quot; 25 (November 1998)
* 25 most powerful people in networking by &quot;Network World&quot; (January 4, 1999)
* &quot;Time&quot; Digital 50 (1999)
* Honorary Doctor of Laws, Mississippi College (1992)
* Honorary doctorate, Tougaloo College (1998)

==Fraud==
On June 25, 2002, WorldCom admitted to nearly $3.9 billion in accounting misstatements and on July 22, 2002, it filed for bankruptcy. 

The figure eventually grew to $11 billion. This initiated a series of investigations and legal proceedings, which focused on Ebbers, WorldCom&#x27;s former CEO. 

Ebbers blamed the accounting scandal on his subordinates, including WorldCom CFO Scott Sullivan.

===Congressional hearing===
In response to a subpoena, Ebbers appeared before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services on July 8, 2002. At these hearings, Ebbers stated &quot;I do not believe I have anything to hide, I believe that no one will conclude that I engaged in any criminal or fraudulent conduct.&quot; 

After making this statement, Ebbers asserted his right against self-incrimination per the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Ebbers&#x27;s statement constituted testimony that could not undergo cross-examination and Ebbers was threatened with Contempt of Congress charges, although no charges were filed.

===Criminal charges and verdict===
On August 27, 2003, Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson filed a 15-count indictment against Ebbers. The indictment charged that he violated securities laws by defrauding investors on multiple occasions between January 2001 and March 2002. On November 20, 2003, the charges by Oklahoma were dropped, with the right to refile retained, to defer to federal charges. 

On March 2, 2004, federal authorities indicted Ebbers on securities fraud and conspiracy charges. On May 25, 2004, federal prosecutors increased the list of charges to 9 felonies: 1 count each of conspiracy and securities fraud, and 7 counts of filing false statements with securities regulators. On March 15, 2005, Ebbers was found guilty of all charges. On March 30, 2005, an agreement to extend the statute of limitations on the charges from Oklahoma was signed, allowing Oklahoma prosecutors time to see the results of federal sentencing.

===Sentencing and jail time===
On July 13, 2005, federal judge Barbara S. Jones, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sentenced Ebbers to 25 years in a federal prison in Louisiana. Ebbers was allowed to remain free for another year while his appeal was being considered. His conviction was upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in July 2006. On September 6, 2006, the presiding judge ordered him to report to jail on September 26 to start serving his 25-year sentence. Ebbers reported to Oakdale Federal Correctional Institution in Oakdale, Louisiana, on September 26, 2006, driving himself to the prison in his Mercedes-Benz vehicle. Ebbers served in the low-security portion of the complex, which typically houses non-violent offenders and is built like a school dormitory. He was granted early release after serving 12 years in December 2019, due to health problems.

===Civil suits===
On October 11, 2002, WorldCom investors brought a class action civil lawsuit against Ebbers and other defendants, alleging injuries as a result of Ebbers&#x27;s securities fraud violations. Judge Denise Cote of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the parties in the lawsuit to negotiate. The parties agreed that Ebbers and his codefendants would distribute over $6.13 billion, plus interest, to over 830,000 individuals and institutions that had held stocks and bonds in WorldCom at the time of its collapse. Ebbers agreed to relinquish almost all of his assets, including a home in Mississippi, and his interests in a lumber company, a marina, a golf course, a hotel, and thousands of acres of forested real estate. After the settlement, Ebbers&#x27;s wife was left with an estimated $50,000 in known assets. On September 21, 2005, Judge Cote approved the settlement and dismissed the lawsuit against Ebbers.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
In 1968, Ebbers married Linda Pigott and the couple raised three daughters. Ebbers filed for divorce in July 1997 and married his second wife, Kristie Webb, in the spring of 1999. She filed for divorce on April 16, 2008, less than two years after he entered prison.

===Personal holdings===
At his peak in early 1999, Ebbers was worth an estimated $1.4 billion and listed as 174th on the Forbes 400. His personal holdings included:
* Douglas Lake Canada&#x27;s biggest ranch – 500,000 acres (2,000 km2) in British Columbia. General partner/president. Acquired in 1998 for about $65 million. Sold on May 30, 2003, by MCI to E. Stanley Kroenke.

===Other activities===
From 1993 through 1995, Ebbers served as chairman of the board of directors of the Competitive Telecommunications Association, where he pleaded with the United States Congress to improve competition with the incumbent telecommunications companies.

In 1997, he became the chair for Mississippi College&#x27;s New Dawn Campaign, a $100 million fundraising campaign to improve campus facilities.

In July 2001, Ebbers was proposed by George W. Bush as the chair for the President&#x27;s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.

===Religious faith===
While CEO of WorldCom, Ebbers was a member of the Easthaven Baptist Church in Brookhaven, Mississippi. As a high-profile member of the congregation, Ebbers regularly taught Sunday school and attended the morning church service with his family. His faith was overt, and he often started corporate meetings with prayer. 

When the allegations of conspiracy and fraud were first brought to light in 2002, Ebbers addressed the congregation and insisted on his innocence. &quot;I just want you to know you aren&#x27;t going to church with a crook,&quot; he said. &quot;No one will find me to have knowingly committed fraud.&quot;

===Death===
Ebbers died at his home in Brookhaven, Mississippi, on February 2, 2020, at the age of 78, just over a month after being granted compassionate release from prison due to his ill health. His lawyers said that he was, by the time of his death, legally blind and suffering from dementia, anemia and significant weight loss.

<doc id="398833" wikidata="Q193685" url="?curid=398833" title="Tufa">
<text>Tufa is a variety of limestone formed when carbonate minerals precipitate out of water in unheated rivers or lakes. Geothermally heated hot springs sometimes produce similar (but less porous) carbonate deposits, which are known as &quot;travertine&quot; or &quot;thermogene travertine&quot;. Tufa is sometimes referred to as &quot;meteogene travertine&quot;.

==Classification and features==
Modern and fossil tufa deposits abound with wetland plants; as such, many tufa deposits are characterised by their large component, and are highly porous. Tufa forms either in fluvial channels or in lacustrine environments. Ford and Pedley (1996) provide a review of tufa systems worldwide.
===Fluvial deposits===
Deposits can be classified by their depositional environment (or otherwise by vegetation or petrographically). Pedley (1990) provides an extensive classification system, which includes the following classes of fluvial tufa:
*Spring – Deposits form on emergence from a spring/seep. Morphology can vary from wetlands to spring aprons (see calcareous sinter)
*Braided channel – Deposits form within a fluvial channel, dominated by oncoids (see oncolite)
*Cascade – Deposits form at waterfalls, deposition is focused here due to accelerated flow (see Geochemistry)
*Barrage – Deposits form as a series of barrages across a channel, which may grow up to several metres in height. Barrages often contain a significant detrital component, composed of organic material (leaf litter, branches etc.).
===Lacustrine deposits===
Lacustrine tufas are generally formed at the periphery of lakes and built-up phytoherms (freshwater reefs), and on stromatolites. Oncoids are also common in these environments.

===Calcareous sinter===
Although sometimes regarded as a distinct carbonate deposit, calcareous sinter formed from ambient temperature water can be considered a sub-type of tufa.
===Speleothems===
Calcareous speleothems may be regarded as a form of calcareous sinter. They lack any significant macrophyte component due to the absence of light, and for this reason they are often morphologically closer to travertine or calcareous sinter.

===Columns===
Tufa columns are an unusual form of tufa typically associated with saline lakes. They are distinct from most tufa deposits in that they lack any significant macrophyte component, due to the salinity excluding mesophilic organisms. Some tufa columns may actually form from hot-springs, and may therefore constitute a form of travertine. It is generally thought that such features form from CaCO3 precipitated when carbonate rich source waters emerge into alkaline soda lakes. They have also been found in marine settings in the Ikka fjord of Greenland where the Ikaite columns can reach up to in height.

==Biology==
Tufa deposits form an important habitat for a diverse flora. Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts etc.) and diatoms are well represented. The porosity of the deposits creates a wet habitat ideal for these plants.

==Geochemistry==
Modern tufa is formed from alkaline waters, supersaturated with calcite. On emergence, waters degas CO2 due to the lower atmospheric CO2 (see partial pressure), resulting in an increase in pH. Since carbonate solubility decreases with increased pH, precipitation is induced. Supersaturation may be enhanced by factors leading to a reduction in CO2, for example increased air-water interactions at waterfalls may be important, as may photosynthesis.

Recently it has been demonstrated that microbially induced precipitation may be more important than physico-chemical precipitation. Pedley et al. (2009) showed with flume experiments that precipitation does not occur unless a biofilm is present, despite supersaturation.

Calcite is the dominant mineral precipitate, followed by the polymorph aragonite.

==Occurrence==
Tufa is common in many parts of the world including:
*Pyramid Lake, Nevada, US – tufa formations
*Big Soda Lake, Nevada, US – tufa formations only a century old
*Mono Lake, California, US – tufa columns
*Trona Pinnacles, California, US – tufa columns
*Sitting Bull Falls, New Mexico, US - tufa waterfall
*Matlock Bath, Derbyshire, United Kingdom
*North Dock Tufa, United Kingdom
*Basturs Lakes, Pallars Jussà, Catalonia – tufa mounds
*Various parts of Armenia, such as Artik
*The southwestern coastline of Western Australia
*The Madikwe Game Reserve in the North West Province, South Africa
*The Kadishi tufa fall, Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa
*Various parts of southern Italy.

Some sources suggest that &quot;tufa&quot; was used as the primary building material for most of the châteaux of the Loire Valley, France. This results from a mis-translation of the terms &quot;tuffeau jaune&quot; and &quot;tuffeau blanc&quot;, which are porous varieties of the Late Cretaceous marine limestone known as chalk.

=== Dinaric karst watercourses ===

*Una river, Bosnia and Herzegovina
*Pliva, Bosnia and Herzegovina
*Trebižat, Bosnia and Herzegovina
*Buna, Bosnia and Herzegovina
*Bregava, Bosnia and Herzegovina
*Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia
*Krka, Croatia
*Zrmanja with Krupa tributary, Croatia
*Kupa, Croatia and Slovenia
*Krka, Slovenia

==Uses==
Tufa is occasionally shaped into a planter. Its porous consistency makes it ideal for alpine gardens. A concrete mixture called hypertufa is used for similar purposes.
In the 4th century BC, tufa was used to build Roman walls up to 10m high and 3.5m thick. The soft stone allows for easy sculpting. Tufa masonry was used in cemeteries, such as the one in Cerveteri.

<text>The Ubaid period (c. 5500–3700 BC) is a prehistoric period of Mesopotamia. The name derives from Tell al-&#x27;Ubaid where the earliest large excavation of Ubaid period material was conducted initially in 1919 by Henry Hall, Leonard Woolley in 1922-1923, and later by Pinhas Delougaz in 1937. Excavations continue into the present day. 

In South Mesopotamia the period is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain although it is likely earlier periods exist that are obscured under the alluvium. In the south it has a very long duration between about 5500 and 3800 BC when it is replaced by the Uruk period.

In Northern Mesopotamia the period runs only between about 5300 and 4300 BC. It is preceded by the Halaf period and the Halaf-Ubaid Transitional period and succeeded by the Late Chalcolithic period.

== History of research ==
The excavators of Eridu and Tell al-&#x27;Ubaid found Ubaid pottery for the first time in the 1910-1920s. In 1930, the attendees at a conference in Baghdad defined the concept of an &quot;Ubaid pottery style&quot;. This characteristic pottery of this style was a black-on-buff painted ware. This conference also defined the Eridu and Hajji Muhammed styles. Scholars at this conference mistakenly thought that these pottery styles were so different that &quot;[...] they could not have developed out of the old, as is the case with the Uruk ware after the al-&#x27;Ubaid ware [...]&quot;. For many attendants of the conference, &quot;this sequence based largely on pottery represented a series of different &#x27;ethnic elements&#x27; in the occupation of southern Mesopotamia.&quot; These ideas about the nature of the Ubaid style phenomenon did not last. The term &quot;Ubaid&quot; is still used, but its meaning has changed over time.

Joan Oates demonstrated in 1960 that the Eridu and Hajji Muhammed styles were not distinct at all. Instead, they were part of the greater Ubaid phenomenon. She proposed a chronological framework that divides the Ubaid period in four phases. Other scholars later proposed two more phases, zero and five.

Scholars in the 1930s only knew a few Ubaid sites. These included the type site of Tell al-&#x27;Ubaid, Ur, and in the north, Tepe Gawra. Since then, archaeologists have discovered Ubaid material culture throughout the ancient Near East. There are now Ubaid sites in the Amuq Valley in the northwest and all the way to the Persian Gulf coast in the southeast. Important research includes the many excavations in the Hamrin area in the 1970s. There, archaeologists found a complete Ubaid settlement at Tell Abada, and a very well-preserved house at Tell Madhur. The excavation at Tell el-&#x27;Oueili in the 1980s revealed occupation layers that were older than those from Eridu. This discovery pushed back the date for the earliest human occupation of southern Mesopotamia.

Excavations along southern coast of the Persian Gulf provided a great deal of evidence for contacts with Mesopotamia. The site of H3 in Kuwait, for example, provided the earliest evidence in the world for seafaring. The explosion of archaeological research in Iraqi Kurdistan since the 2010s also led to discovery of even more new data on the Ubaid. For example, this research demonstrated that cultural links between the Shahrizor Plain and the Hamrin area farther south were stronger than those with the north.

== Climate and environment ==

Mesopotamia does not have local, high-resolution climate proxy records such as the Soreq Cave does. This makes it difficult to reconstruct the region&#x27;s past climate. Even so, it is known that the environment during the sixth and fifth millennium BC was not the same as today. A more temperate climate settled in around 10,000 BC. Marshy and riverine areas transformed into floodplains and finally, river banks with trees. The area south of Baghdad may have been inhabitable by humans in the eleventh millennium BC, but current evidence indicates that humans could have lived south of Uruk as early as the eighth millennium BC. This is much earlier than what had been the oldest evidence of human occupation in this area. The oldest known site in southern Mesopotamia (Tell el-&#x27;Oueili) dates to the Ubaid 0 period. Archaeobotanical research in the Ubaid 0 levels at &#x27;Oueili (6500-6000 BC) has indicated the presence of Euphrates poplar and sea clubrush, both indicative of a wetland environment. As a result of changes in sea-level, the shoreline of the Persian Gulf during the Ubaid was different from that of today. At the beginning of the Ubaid, around 6500 BC, the shoreline at Kuwait may have run slightly farther south. During the subsequent 2.5 millennia, the shoreline moved farther northward, up to the ancient city of Ur around 4000 BC.

Date palms were present in southern Mesopotamia since at least the eleventh millennium BC, predating the earliest evidence for domesticated dates from Eridu by several millennia. Date palms require a perennial water source, again indicating that this period may have been wetter than today. Similarly, oak was present from the eighth millennium, but disappeared at around the same time that Ubaid material culture spread outward from southern Mesopotamia during the sixth millennium BC. It has been suggested that acquisition of high-quality wood may have played a role in this expansion.

The available evidence in northern Mesopotamia points to a cooler and drier climate during the Hassuna and Halaf periods. During the Halaf-Ubaid Transitional (HUT), Ubaid and early Uruk periods, this developed into a climate characterised by stronger seasonal variation, heavy torrential rains, and dry summers.

== Dating and geographical distribution ==
Ubaid and Ubaid-like material culture has been discovered over an immense area. Ubaid ceramics have been found from Mersin in the west to in the east, and from Norşuntepe and Arslantepe in the north to Dosariyah in the south along the Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia. In this area, researchers have discerned considerable regional variation, indicating that the Ubaid was not a monolithic culture through time and space.

Currently, the Ubaid period is most commonly divided in six phases, called Ubaid 0-5. Some of these phases equate with pottery styles that in earlier publications, were considered to be distinct from Ubaid, but that are now considered to be part of the same cultural phenomenon. Some of these styles, such as Hajji Muhammed (previously thought to be Ubaid 2) are now known to occur in Ubaid 3 contexts as well, thereby limiting their value as chronological markers. The relative chronology is based on the long stratigraphic sequences of sites such as Ur, Eridu, and Tepe Gawra. The absolute chronology is more difficult to establish, mainly due to a lack of abundant radiocarbon dates determined in southern Mesopotamia.
=== Southern Mesopotamia ===

In the south, corresponding to the area that would later be known as Sumer, the entire Ubaid period extends from ca. 6500 to 3800 BC. It is here that the oldest known Ubaid site - Tell el-&#x27;Oueili - was discovered. Perhaps because such ancient settlements are buried deep under alluvial sediments, to date no archaeological site in southern Iraq has yielded remains older than Ubaid. This was the case, for example, of the site of Hadji Muhammed, which was discovered only by accident.

=== Central and northern Mesopotamia ===

In central and northern Iraq, the Ubaid culture was preceded by the Hassuna and Samarra cultures. The Ubaid may have developed out of the latter. In northern Syria and southeastern Turkey, the Ubaid follows upon the Halaf period, and a relatively short Halaf-Ubaid Transitional period (HUT) dating to c. 5500-5200 BC has been proposed as well. HUT pottery assemblages displayed both typically Ubaid and Halaf characteristics. The relationships between these cultural periods is complex and not yet fully understood, including how and when the Ubaid began to appear in northern Mesopotamia. To resolve these issues, modern scholarship tends to focus more on regional trajectories of change where different cultural elements from the Halaf, Samarra, or Ubaid - pottery, architecture, and so forth - could co-exist. This makes it increasingly difficult to define an occupation phase at a site as, for example, purely Ubaid or purely Halaf.

In northern Mesopotamia, Ubaid characteristics only begin to appear in Ubaid 2-3, i.e. toward the end of the sixth millennium BC, so that the entire Ubaid period there would be much shorter. For Syria, a range of 5300-4300 BC has been suggested. However, some scholars have argued that the interaction between the originally southern Mesopotamian Ubaid and the north had begun during Ubaid 1-2.

=== Persian Gulf ===

Ubaid pottery began to appear along the Persian Gulf coast toward the end of the sixth millennium BC, reaching a peak around 5300 BC and continuing into the fifth millennium. Coastal sites where Ubaid pottery has been discovered include Bahra 1 and H3 in Kuwait, Dosariyah in Saudi Arabia, and Dalma Island in the United Arab Emirates. Ubaid pottery has also been found further inland along the central Gulf coast at sites such as Ain Qannas, suggesting that the pottery may have been a valuable trade item, rather than being a container for some other commodity. This suggestion is reinforced by locally-produced pottery imitating Ubaid wares found at Dosariyah. It is unclear which products were traded for the pottery. Suggestions include foodstuffs (dates), semi-precious materials, jewellery (made from pearl and shell), animal products, and livestock. Notably, the degree of cultural interaction between the Ubaid and local Neolithic communities is much stronger in the area of Kuwait than farther south, up to the point that it has been suggested that Mesopotamians may have lived for part of the year at sites such as H3 and Bahra 1. Small objects such as labrets, tokens, clay nails, and small tools that may have had cosmetic use, and that are known from southern Mesopotamian sites also occur on sites along the Gulf coast, notably the sites in Kuwait.

Conversely, evidence exists for Arabian Neolithic material in southern Mesopotamia. It has been noted that certain types of flint arrowheads found at Ur show clear resemblance with the Arabian Bifacial Tradition. Arabian Coarse Ware has been found at the sites of &#x27;Oueili and Eridu. As at the sites in Kuwait, it may be possible that Arabian Neolithic groups also lived in southern Mesopotamia.

== Material culture ==

=== Pottery ===
The Ubaid period was first distinguished on the basis of its painted pottery. Ceramics continue to be a main characteristic to determine the chronology and geographical distribution of the period. The paint varies from black to brown, purple, and dark green and the pottery fabric usually has a buff to red-green brown color. Ubaid 1-2 pottery had dense, geometric, and abstract decoration. Later pottery was less decorated, with bands and swags being the most common patterns of decoration. The slow potter&#x27;s wheel came into use during Ubaid 3-4, which may have played a role in the decrease in decoration.

The coarse, plant-tempered pottery found at many Late and Post-Ubaid sites in northern Mesopotamia has been interpreted as some kind of vessel for handing out rations or as evidence of more specialized production, and as such, may have been a precursor of the beveled rim bowl from the Uruk period. As with many other aspects of Ubaid material culture, it is possible to distinguish different geographical traditions in the production of the coba bowl during the Ubaid period.

=== Stone tools ===
Flint was widely available in Mesopotamia and could be sourced from outcrops in the mountains of Zagros and Jebel Sinjar, from limestone and river terraces in northern Mesopotamia, and from alluvial deposits in southern Mesopotamia. Different qualities of flint were used, depending on what kind of tool was made from it. For example, blades were made from a higher quality flint than other tools, and they may have been produced off-site, indicating that not only raw materials but also finished products were transported over larger distances. Flint was used for a variety of tools, including arrowheads, sickle blades, hoes that are sometimes considered a hallmark of the Ubaid, and a variety of tools for piercing and drilling. Flint assemblages display both regional and temporal variation.

Obsidian was also in use during the Ubaid, although the percentage of obsidian tools that was found at archaeological sites fluctuates widely across Mesopotamia. At sites along the middle Euphrates, only few pieces were usually found, and the number of obsidian artefacts was also limited in southern Mesopotamian sites. At sites along the Khabur and the upper Tigris, obsidian was more common. Also, obsidian seems to have been less common during the Ubaid than during the preceding Halaf period and the subsequent Uruk period. Obsidian could be transported over hundreds of kilometers. For example, obsidian tools found along the Gulf coast at sites such as Dosariyah (Saudi Arabia) and Wadi Debayan (Qatar) came from sources in southeastern Turkey.

The Ubaid may have witnessed a shift in the production of flint tools from being carried out as a domestic activity to a more specialized activity carried out by dedicated craftspeople. This may have been associated with the introduction of Canaanean blade technology, which became common in the fourth millennium BC that may have been linked to increased mass-production and intensification of agricultural strategies.

=== Metallurgy ===
Evidence for metallurgy comes from several sites in Upper Mesopotamia, all dating to the final stages of the Ubaid period. At Mersin, Level XVI (5000-4900 BC), unalloyed copper pins and chisels were found. At southeastern Anatolian sites such as Değirmentepe and Norşuntepe, metallurgical production was practiced during the Ubaid 3, as evidenced by furnaces and related finds. At late fifth millennium , northern Iraq, kilns were excavated that may have been used for the production of both pottery and metal. Copper objects are also known from the Ubaid levels at Tepe Gawra (XVII-XII) and Tell Arpachiyah. Copper objects were absent in the Ubaid levels at Eridu and &#x27;Oueili, possibly indicating that copper use spread southward from the north. However, copper may have been traded, as it was present in elite burials of the Susa I (terminal Ubaid) necropolis at Susa east of the Tigris. In general, copper objects seem to be very rare and gold has not been found at Ubaid sites.

=== Boats and boat models ===
The Ubaid period provides the first evidence for boating in the ancient Near East. Ceramic boat models have been recovered from numerous sites across Mesopotamia, from Zeidan and Tell Mashnaqa in modern-day northern Syria to Eridu and &#x27;Oueili in the south and Abada in the Hamrin. These models date from Ubaid 1-4, but become more common from Ubaid 3 onward. The models indicate that different boat types may have been in use, including reed boats, and boats with masts. It has been noted that no evidence for boats has been recovered from Halaf sites in northern Mesopotamia, and that Ubaid 3, from which more boat models have been recovered, coincides with the expansion of the Ubaid toward the north and into the Persian Gulf.

At the site of H3 in modern-day Kuwait, a ceramic boat model and a ceramic disc with an image of a two-masted boat were recovered. The latter is the oldest evidence for the use of masts and sails. At the same site, pieces of bitumen with barnacles attached to one side and reed-impressions on the other sides were recovered. These pieces are the earliest evidence for boats in Western Asia, and the earliest evidence for seagoing vessels in the world.

=== Wool production ===
Evidence for the production of wool is ambiguous and mostly indirect. Wool-bearing sheep have been clearly attested in Uruk-period sites, and the domestication of sheep and goat started in the ninth millennium BC, but exactly when wool-production emerged between those two fixed points is unclear. There is some evidence for emerging wool production in the fifth millennium BC, i.e. late Ubaid. Some of the earliest evidence comes in the form of an animal figurine from Iran dated to c. 5000 BC with incised decorations that might possibly represent wool. At , an Ubaid site in northern Syria, indirect evidence for wool production has been found in the form of spindle whorls, clay scrapers, and a clay sealing with a cord impression that might have come from rope spun from wool fibers. The animal bone assemblage at this site had a large percentage of domesticated sheep and goat, with changes in the assemblage suggesting that the production of secondary products (such as wool and milk) became more important toward the late Ubaid and the Uruk period. The spindle whorls from Kosak Shamali, and also those from Telul eth-Thalathat II (northern Iraq), gradually decreased in weight, which could indicate that more and more finer-quality or softer fibers were spun. At (Iraqi Kurdistan), evidence from animal bones also suggests that wool production may have been important.

=== Stamp seals ===
Stamp seals had been in use in Upper Mesopotamia since the seventh millennium BC. By the time of the Ubaid period, a wide range of motifs had developed, including geometric patterns and depictions of animals and occasionally, humans. The Ubaid period saw the first depictions of ibex-headed and bird-headed humans.

=== Figurines ===
The majority of Ubaid figurines represented various animals, including sheep, cattle, and dogs. Human figurines were already present in previous periods. The majority of the human figures are female, but male and figurines without gender emphasis exist as well. Those from the early Ubaid reflect a continuation of earlier traditions. A single, painted figurine from the Ubaid 0 levels at Tell el-&#x27;Oueili has been interpreted as an early representation of the so-called &quot;ophidian figurines&quot;, which became common in the later Ubaid. Both seating and standing figurines were made, with paint being used to detail body parts, clothing, or body modifications. &quot;Ophidian figures&quot; have been exclusively found at various southern Mesopotamian sites. They are characterised by a slender body, long, reptilian head with incised eyes and mouth and a threedimensional small nose. This particular rendering of the face may be a representation of a mask or possibly headshaping. The hands are placed before the abdomen, sometimes with incised fingers. The figurines are thought to be naked. Paint is sometimes used to indicate hair or other details. 

In the earlier Ubaid, ophidian figures were only used in domestic contexts, whereas in Ubaid 3-4, they appear in graves as well, indicating a shift in how these figures were used. The rarity of ophidian figures as grave gifts may indicate differential treatment of the dead, possibly based on age, kinship, or social standing.

=== Burials ===
The most common burial practice during the Ubaid seems to have been primary inhumation; i.e. burial of the complete body. During Ubaid 4, some 80% (adults) and 94% (infants) of the burials consisted of primary inhumations. The dead were often accompanied by personal adornments such as beads, necklaces, and headdresses. Pots (presumably) containing foodstuffs were also common. Pieces of red ochre have also been recovered from graves. Burials have been excavated at many Ubaid sites, with exceptionally large numbers coming from Tell Abada (127 infant burials) and Eridu (193 burials).

By the fifth millennium BC, children and adults were given differing treatments in death. The available evidence indicates that infants were primarily buried inside the settlement, often near larger, presumably more important dwellings, and often in pots. The association of child burials with larger buildings is well-illustrated at the sites of Tell Abada and Tepe Gawra. It has been suggested that this pattern of child burials near larger dwellings was related to increasing social differentiation between kin groups. Adults, on the other hand, were buried at the edge of the settlement in communal burial grounds in pit burials or inside clay boxes. Such burial grounds have for example been excavated at Eridu.

These burial practices represent a clear break from those of the preceding Late Neolithic period. During the Late Neolithic, burials were often secondary and burial treatment was very diverse. The Ubaid witnessed a marked shift toward primary burial, less diverse burial customs, and less diversity in burial gifts. This shift has been interpreted as a reflection of changing perceptions of personhood.

=== Body modification ===
Evidence for cranial modification, i.e. deliberate headshaping, among both men and women, has come from many archaeological sites throughout wider Mesopotamia. Where headshaping was detected, it was all of the same type, i.e. one- or two-band circumferential headshaping, which results in an elongated shape of the head. Different types of headshaping were practiced prior to and after the Ubaid period across the Near East, but it seems that the specific technique of circumferential headshaping may have originated in Iran, east of the area of Ubaid influence, and reached its peak during the Ubaid period. It has been interpreted as a marker for socio-cultural group affiliation during the Ubaid.

Labrets and/or ear-spools were likewise recovered from many archaeological Ubaid sites across Mesopotamia and its border regions. In at least one case from southwestern Iran, a labret was found &quot;in situ&quot; in a burial, located at the mandible of the buried individual and with associated tooth wear indicating that it had been worn. Labrets were absent from Halaf sites in northern Mesopotamia, again indicating that they may have been important markers of socio-cultural identity during the Ubaid. Their use seems to have declined again during the Uruk period.

== Subsistence economy ==

=== Agriculture ===
The modern excavations at Tell Zeidan have revealed a wealth of information on the subsistence economy of a large northern Mesopotamian Ubaid settlement. Cultivated species included barley, wheat, lentil, ervil, and flax. There is some evidence that the inhabitants of Zeidan practiced a form of floodwater irrigation on agricultural lands. The excavators have suggested that the unpredictability of this type of irrigation may have been a factor in increasing social complexity. The relative absence of animal dung, and the common presence of charred wood remains, suggests that wood was used as fuel. At Surezha, dung was commonly used for fuel, and there is some evidence that cattle were used as traction animals for plowing fields.

=== Animal husbandry ===
Tell Zeidan again provides a wealth of information. The composition of the animal bone assemblage from Zeidan changed considerably from the Halaf to the Ubaid period. During the Halaf, some 50% of the animal bones came from wild species (indicative of hunting), whereas during the Ubaid more than 90% represented domesticated species (indicative of herding and keeping animals). Common animals were sheep, goat, cattle, and pigs. A comparison with other Ubaid sites in northern Mesopotamia showed that, in general, pastoralism became more important and reliance on wild fauna decreased somewhat, but this pattern was not so evident at other sites as it was at Zeidan. There was no indication at Zeidan that there was spatial differentiation across the site in how animal products were consumed, suggesting that food stuffs were not a means to express social differentiation.

=== Fishing ===
The Ubaid-related sites along the Persian Gulf coast provide evidence for fishing. The range of species recovered at H3, for example, indicates that fishing probably mainly took place in shallow coastal waters. Tuna, which cannot be caught in Kuwait Bay anymore, also was found at the site. Fish may have been a local commodity that was traded for the Mesopotamian pottery that has been found at sites along the Persian Gulf.

== Society ==

Ubaid culture is characterized by large unwalled village settlements, multi-roomed rectangular mud-brick houses and the appearance of the first temples of public architecture in Mesopotamia, with a growth of a two-tier settlement hierarchy of centralized large sites of more than ten hectares surrounded by smaller village sites of less than one hectare. Domestic equipment included a distinctive fine quality buff or greenish colored pottery decorated with geometric designs in brown or black paint. Tools such as sickles were often made of hard fired clay in the south, while in the north stone and sometimes metal were used. Villages thus contained specialised craftspeople, potters, weavers, and metalworkers, although the bulk of the population were agricultural labourers, farmers, and seasonal pastoralists.

During the Ubaid Period (5000–4000 BC), the movement toward urbanization began. &quot;Agriculture and animal husbandry [domestication] were widely practiced in sedentary communities&quot;. There were also tribes who practiced domesticating animals as far north as Turkey, and as far south as the Zagros Mountains. The Ubaid period in the south was associated with intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture, and the use of the plough, both introduced from the north, possibly through the earlier Choga Mami, Hadji Muhammed, and Samarra cultures.

The Ubaid period as a whole, based upon the analysis of grave goods, was one of increasingly polarized social stratification and decreasing egalitarianism. Bogucki describes this as a phase of &quot;Trans-egalitarian&quot; competitive households, in which some fall behind as a result of downward social mobility. Morton Fried and Elman Service have hypothesised that Ubaid culture saw the rise of an elite class of hereditary chieftains, perhaps heads of kin groups linked in some way to the administration of the temple shrines and their granaries, responsible for mediating intra-group conflict and maintaining social order. It would seem that various collective methods, perhaps instances of what Thorkild Jacobsen called primitive democracy, in which disputes were previously resolved through a council of one&#x27;s peers, were no longer sufficient for the needs of the local community.

Ubaid culture originated in the south, but still has clear connections to earlier cultures in the region of middle Iraq. The appearance of the Ubaid culture has sometimes been linked to the so-called Sumerian problem, related to the origins of Sumerian civilisation. Whatever the ethnic origins of this group, this culture saw for the first time a clear tripartite social division among intensive subsistence peasant farmers, with crops and animals coming from the north, tent-dwelling nomadic pastoralists dependent upon their herds, and hunter-fisher folk of the Arabian littoral, living in reed huts.

Stein and Özbal describe the Near East oecumene that resulted from Ubaid expansion, contrasting it to the colonial expansionism of the later Uruk period. &quot;A contextual analysis comparing different regions shows that the Ubaid expansion took place largely through the peaceful spread of an ideology, leading to the formation of numerous new indigenous identities that appropriated and transformed superficial elements of Ubaid material culture into locally distinct expressions.&quot;

There is some evidence of warfare during the Ubaid period although it is extremely rare. The &quot;Burnt Village&quot; at Tell Sabi Abyad could be suggestive of destruction during war, but it could also have been due to other causes, such as wildfire or accident. Ritual burning is also possible since the bodies inside were already dead by the time they were burned. A mass grave at Tepe Gawra contained 24 bodies apparently buried without any funeral rituals, possibly indicating it was a mass grave from violence. Copper weapons were also present in the form of arrow heads and sling bullets, although these could have been used for other purpose; two clay pots recovered from the era have decorations showing arrows used for the purpose of hunting. A copper axe head was made in the late Ubaid period, which could have been a tool or a weapon.

During the late Ubaid period around 4500–4000 BC, there was some increase in social polarization, with central houses in the settlements becoming larger. But there were no real cities until the later Uruk period.

=== Language, ethnicity, and genetics ===
The languages that were spoken during the Ubaid period cannot be determined. Despite the fact that the Ubaid period is prehistorical, it has featured prominently in discussions on the origin and presence of the Sumerian and Akkadian languages in Sumer. This debate has been called the &quot;Sumerian problem&quot; or &quot;Sumerian question&quot;. The starting point of this debate was that the oldest cuneiform tablets were written in Sumerian, and that earlier pictographical tablets from the Late Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods (3200-3000 BC) were likely written in the same language. Based on this evidence, Henri Frankfort proposed in the 1930s that the people who wrote and presumably spoke Sumerian, originally came from the Iranian highlands and settled Mesopotamia at the start of the Ubaid period. Speiser, on the other hand, thought that the Sumerians entered Mesopotamia during the Uruk period and interpreted the regional styles that existed before that time, i.e. Ubaid, Hassuna, Halaf, as evidence of distinct ethnic groups.

More recent discussion has taken a more careful approach, taking pains not to equate pots with people or language with ethnicity. Archaeologists have stressed that a high degree of cultural continuity is evident throughout the Ubaid and Uruk periods, and it seems that there is some agreement that &quot;the relation between three categories, linguistic, racial and ethnic, is exceedingly complex in Mesopotamia and still far from being sufficiently investigated&quot;.

Scarce DNA analysis of human skeletal material from various archaeological sites in Upper Mesopotamia (none of which dated to the Ubaid period) provides some evidence for genetic links with other regions, but also provides evidence for continuity within Mesopotamia. Most importantly, the dating of genetic influxes that have been detected, has not been refined adequately in order to be assigned to the Ubaid period - or any other period earlier than the one from which the skeletal material came. In other words, this genetic influx could have happened during the Ubaid - or not.

<text>Darren Stanley Hayes (born 8 May 1972) is an Australian singer, songwriter, music producer and composer. He was the singer of the pop duo Savage Garden until their disbandment. Their 1997 album &quot;Savage Garden&quot; peaked at #1 in Australia, #2 in the United Kingdom, and #3 in the United States. It spawned the singles &quot;I Want You&quot;, &quot;To the Moon and Back&quot;, and Australian and US #1 hit &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot;. The duo followed the success of their debut album with &quot;Affirmation&quot; (1999), which provided additional hits such as Australian and US #1 hit &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; and Australian #3 hit &quot;The Animal Song&quot;. Savage Garden disbanded in 2001.

Hayes released his first solo album, &quot;Spin&quot;, in 2002. The album sold two million copies worldwide, debuting at #2 in the UK and #3 in Australia. It delivered the hit single &quot;Insatiable&quot;. Hayes&#x27;s other solo albums are &quot;The Tension and the Spark&quot; (2004), the double album &quot;This Delicate Thing We&#x27;ve Made&quot; (2007), &quot;Secret Codes and Battleships&quot; (2011), and &quot;Homosexual&quot; (2022). Hayes&#x27; autobiography, &quot;Unlovable&quot;, was published in November 2024.

==Early life and education==
Hayes was born 8 May 1972, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. His parents are Richard and Judy Hayes. Hayes has an older sister named Tracey and an older brother named Peter. Hayes has described his father as an alcoholic who regularly subjected Hayes and his mother to violence.

At school, Hayes was bullied and physically and verbally abused. He described himself as &quot;a big-hearted, emotional, and excitable&quot; teenager, with an obsession for &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;E.T&quot;.

In late 1987, he got the chance to see his hero Michael Jackson performing live in Brisbane as part of the Bad Tour. He credits this as encouraging him to pursue a career in entertainment. His other acknowledged influences are Stevie Nicks, Madonna, Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, Prince and Marvin Gaye, and he has cited U2&#x27;s &quot;With or Without You&quot; as the most touching song he has ever heard.

==Music career==

===1993–2001: Savage Garden===
In mid-1993, Daniel Jones placed an ad in Brisbane street press &quot;Time Off&quot; seeking a vocalist for the group. Hayes, who was studying at university and working as a record sales assistant, joined after his audition. Hayes&#x27; first performance with Red Edge was in front of an audience of four in Toowoomba. The five-piece version of Red Edge played pubs and clubs from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales, while Hayes and Jones started to write original material.

In June 1994, Hayes and Jones left the group to work as a duo, originally known as Crush. By year&#x27;s end, the pair had enough songs for a five-song demo tape under the name Bliss. They sent 150 copies to various record companies around the world. They were renamed Savage Garden after a phrase from &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; by Anne Rice: &quot;Beauty was a Savage Garden&quot;. John Woodruff (The Angels, Baby Animals, Diesel) provided a positive response; he became their talent manager and negotiated a contract with Roadshow Music/Warner Music. In 1995 they entered the studio to work on their debut album with producer Charles Fisher (Air Supply, Moving Pictures, 1927). 

In May 1996, Savage Garden released their debut single &quot;I Want You&quot; under Roadshow Music. It peaked at No. 4 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) singles chart, while on the 1996 End of Year Singles Chart it was highest placed by an Australian artist at No. 12. On 30 September of that year they received their first ARIA award nomination, in the category Breakthrough Artist – Single, for &quot;I Want You&quot;. Their local success drew interest from international labels and they were signed for overseas releases with Columbia Records in late November. The label&#x27;s executives had Woodruff arrange for Hayes and Jones to reside in a Kings Cross hotel for 8 months, where they wrote songs for a debut album to be released in 1997. In November 1996 a second single, &quot;To the Moon and Back&quot;, was released and reached No. 1 in January 1997 in Australia.

&quot;I Want You&quot; was released in North America in February 1997, where it peaked at No. 4 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and by April had achieved gold status according to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It became their first number-one hit, reaching that spot on &quot;RPM&quot;″s Top 100 Singles chart in Canada in June 1997. &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot;, the band&#x27;s third Australian single, was released in March; it also reached No. 1 and became their signature song. 

In March 1997, the duo&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Savage Garden&quot;, entered the Australian charts at No. 1 and peaked there for a total of 19 non-consecutive weeks. In June, the album reached No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold by RIAA. Savage Garden won a record of ten ARIA Awards in September 1997. By the end of 1998, &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; was the most played song on US radio and became the only one-sided single to spend a year in the top 30 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. As of 2005, &quot;Savage Garden&quot; had been certified 12× platinum in Australia, 7× platinum in the US, 3× platinum in Canada, 2× platinum in New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK.

Savage Garden&#x27;s second album, &quot;Affirmation&quot;, was issued in November 1999. According to Australian music journalist Ed Nimmervoll, it was &quot;basically written by phone and computer from their separate corners of the world&quot; with Hayes in New York and Jones in Brisbane. The lead single, &quot;The Animal Song&quot;, appeared in February of that year, which was used in the romantic comedy film &quot;The Other Sister&quot; (1999); it became a No. 3 hit in Australia and Top 20 in the UK and US. In September, the duo released &quot;Affirmation&quot;″s third single &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 in Australia and No. 10 in the UK. It peaked at No. 1 in Australia and later achieved 8× platinum. Within a month, it went platinum in the US, partly due to the single &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;, which hit No. 1 on the Hot 100, also going platinum, and becoming the most-played single on US radio for the year. That track also reached No. 1 in Canada. 

Savage Garden&#x27;s success was reflected at the Billboard Music Awards, where they won Best Adult Contemporary Video and No. 1 Adult Contemporary Song of the Year, for &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;, and No. 1 Adult Contemporary Artist of the Year. &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; stayed on the Monitor/&quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary Airplay Chart for 124 weeks. Savage Garden performed the title track at the 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in October.

Hayes moved to Sausalito in 2000. He became the public face of the duo, doing most of the media. Hayes announced that Savage Garden had broken up in October 2001 during a chat with an Australian journalist. Hayes thought the information would be saved for a later article; it was not. When confronted with this information during the early morning hours, before an unrelated interview, Jones denied the break-up of the band. However, it appears that Jones did not believe the reporter was accurately quoting Hayes and denied what he thought was yet another break-up rumour. Still, the fact that Jones took a back seat in all promotional activities for &quot;Affirmation&quot; seems indicative that Jones was not content to remain within Savage Garden as it had operated in the past. &quot;Savage Garden&quot; had sold over 23 million albums by that stage.
Luciano Pavarotti and Darren Hayes sang &quot;O Sole Mio&quot; together in a concert in 2000.

In 2005, manager of Savage Garden, John Woodruff confirmed that Jones had announced his intention of leaving Savage Garden prior to the promotion for &quot;Affirmation&quot;. Woodruff criticised the media for their treatment of Hayes. The duo have never issued a united statement regarding the situation, yet Hayes has guaranteed that the group will &quot;never, by any chance&quot; reunite, adding in 2020, &quot;Imagine if you had come out and survived a really dysfunctional and toxic relationship, and then for years later people would ask you to please get back in that relationship [...] &quot;I once said I&#x27;d only do it if it cured cancer and that&#x27;s still how I feel.&quot;

===2002–2004: &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;The Tension and the Spark&quot;===
Hayes recorded his first solo album, &quot;Spin&quot;, which was released in 2002. The album was produced by Walter Afanasieff, the producer of &quot;Affirmation&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; carried on in the same musical vein as Savage Garden, with a less soft rock sound and more edgy R&amp;B vibe, although the first single &quot;Insatiable&quot; was a ballad, reaching Number 3 in Australia. Other singles &quot;Strange Relationship&quot;, &quot;Crush (1980 Me)&quot; and &quot;I Miss You&quot; also performed well in charts. The album reached the Top 5 in Australia at Number 3, and in the UK at Number 2. It also reached the top ten in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. In the United States, the album failed to make the same impact as Savage Garden&#x27;s previous releases, reaching Number 35 on &quot;Billboard&quot;. It was later re-issued with a bonus disc consisting of some live and studio tracks.

Hayes spent two years working on his second solo album, &quot;The Tension and the Spark&quot;. Other than the track &quot;I Forgive You&quot;, which was produced with Madonna collaborator Marius De Vries, the entire album was produced by Hayes and Robert Conley (with whom he had previously toured and recorded &quot;Crush (1980 Me)&quot; for &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Do You Believe&quot; for Specificus). The album marked a bold change of direction for Hayes. Conley&#x27;s production was almost entirely electronic, with acoustic instruments buried under walls of sequenced sounds. Although artistically this was a huge step forward and earned Hayes the strongest praise of his career, it alienated a large portion of his audience, who were expecting another album of radio-friendly pop songs. The first single, &quot;Pop!ular&quot;, was released on 12 July 2004. This single reached Number One on the US Dance Charts, and fared well in the UK. Hayes&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;Darkness&quot;, charted in the lower regions of the ARIA top 50 charts.

One of his out-takes from the &quot;Spin&quot; sessions, &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot;, was recorded by Clay Aiken in 2003 for his &quot;Measure of a Man&quot; album. It was later covered by Human Nature, resulting in an Australian top 20 single in April 2004 off their &quot;Walk The Tightrope&quot; album, and was then re-recorded in 2008 featuring Hayes himself.
===2005–2006: &quot;Truly Madly Completely&quot; and parting ways with Columbia===
In 2005, Hayes recorded a track he wrote with Robert Conley called &quot;So Beautiful&quot;, which was included on the Savage Garden greatest hits compilation, &quot;Truly Madly Completely: The Best of Savage Garden&quot;. The compilation also includes a second track by Hayes called &quot;California&quot;. Both of these tracks hark back to Hayes&#x27;s early sound, although still retaining some of the electronic flourishes from &quot;The Tension and the Spark&quot;.

On 9 July 2006, Hayes announced that he had parted ways with Columbia Records after ten years and 24 million album sales together.

The tour following this release saw Hayes play the iconic Sydney Opera House. The performance was recorded and released on a DVD titled &quot;A Big Night in with Darren Hayes&quot;.

===2007–2010: &quot;This Delicate Thing We&#x27;ve Made&quot; and &quot;We Are Smug&quot;===

Hayes finished recording his third solo album, &quot;This Delicate Thing We&#x27;ve Made&quot;, in 2007. The album was a double-disc, with 25 tracks. Many of the tracks were co-written with Robert Conley, and a great deal of the album was written with and produced by Justin Shave, who played keyboards for part of Hayes&#x27;s &quot;Time Machine&quot; tour. The album was released on 20 August 2007, on Hayes&#x27;s own independent record label, Powdered Sugar, while the first single, &quot;On the Verge of Something Wonderful&quot;, was released in Australia on 28 July 2007, and in the UK and online on 6 August 2007.

On 9 April 2007, Hayes released the album track &quot;Who Would Have Thought&quot; from &quot;This Delicate Thing We&#x27;ve Made&quot; as a teaser track on his official website, as well as his MySpace profile. This was accompanied by an animation for the song created by his partner, animator and director, Richard Cullen. Around April 2007, remixes of the album track &quot;Step into the Light&quot; were being played in clubs around the world. The album version of &quot;Step into the Light&quot; was released as a teaser on Hayes&#x27;s official website and MySpace on 30 April 2007.

During the first half of 2007, Hayes performed selected songs from the album in The Time Machine World Tour small, exclusive gigs around the world. Tickets for several of these much sought after shows sold out in under ten minutes. In June 2007, Hayes embarked on a small tour of USA and Canada, stopping in New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles, along with the band Temposhark. The shows were well received with very positive reviews.

On 30 June 2007, Hayes headlined the London Gay Pride at Trafalgar Square. He performed &quot;I Want You&quot; and &quot;On the Verge of Something Wonderful&quot;, as well as a medley that included &quot;Pop!ular&quot;.

In July 2007, Hayes announced The Time Machine Tour that would start out in the UK, and then move on to Hayes&#x27;s home country Australia. On 29 July 2007, &quot;On the Verge of Something Wonderful&quot; was the most selected music video on The Box in the UK. On 20 August 2007, &quot;This Delicate Thing We&#x27;ve Made&quot; was released in the UK, America and Australia. &#x27;The Time Machine Tour&#x27; included venues such as The Royal Albert Hall and the State Theatre in Sydney. His stage was again designed by Willie Williams and included a large bridge that could extend over the first few rows of seats. On the final night, at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Hayes&#x27;s hometown of Brisbane, the performance was recorded in HD for a DVD release. The Time Machine Tour DVD came out in two editions: the special edition which was limited to 2000 copies and contained a four-panel, fold-out, gleaming white box, a thirty-two-page colour booklet with 300 photos and notes from the artist, and the regular edition. The special edition DVD, which was only available from Hayes&#x27; website, was shipped to purchasers on 1 July, and the regular edition, which was available in shops, was released on 22 July.

Hayes did a mini tour in the US in November and December 2007, making appearances at Borders stores and performing two shows in New York City and Philadelphia.

On 18 December 2007, Hayes announced &quot;The Side Two Tour&quot;. The show toured the UK in February 2008 and featured Hayes performing songs from &quot;This Delicate Thing We&#x27;ve Made&quot; that were not featured on &quot;The Time Machine Tour&quot;, in a more intimate setting. In late 2008, the DVD &quot;This Delicate Film We&#x27;ve Made&quot; was announced. The DVD featured selected songs from the album, arranged in a new sequence, and set to visuals that told a loose, abstract animated narrative. The DVD entered the UK music DVD charts at Number 1.

On 19 April 2009, Hayes teased via Twitter that he was preparing another album. On 8 May, Hayes announced, via his MySpace page, that he and Robert Conley had produced an album together titled &quot;We Are Smug&quot;. The ten-track album, with a fair amount of experimentation with both lyrics and music, was made available via a link from his MySpace page, and was made free to download to gauge acceptability of Hayes&#x27;s shifting musical styles. The album is heavily electronic with some heavy beats. It also contains some explicit content. Both Hayes and Conley share vocal duties on this album.

Hayes signed to Sony ATV Music Publishing for a worldwide deal in August 2009. Emma Banks from CAA UK came on board October 2009 to represent Hayes for his touring plans around the new album.

Although the album was completed before the holidays in 2009, Hayes announced in early 2010 that he had more song ideas and he was going back into the studio, which delayed the album another year. Hayes completely finished his fourth solo album in mid-2010, working with top writer/producers from around the world and having the record mixed by Robert Orton.

Hayes also recorded a song for the Finn tribute album &quot;He Will Have His Way&quot;, a cover of &quot;Not Even Close&quot;. It was released on Halloween 2010.

===2011–2021: &quot;Secret Codes and Battleships&quot; and hiatus===
On 17 April 2011, Hayes announced that he had signed a record deal with Mercury Records/Universal Music Australia and signed to EMI Services UK /Europe. He released his fourth studio album in October 2011. The first single titled &quot;Talk Talk Talk&quot; was announced in May and was released on 24 June. The single contains a cover version of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Angel&quot; as the B-side.

It was announced on 20 June, via Hayes&#x27;s Facebook page, that his new album would be titled &quot;Secret Codes and Battleships&quot;.

Hayes announced on Twitter on 22 July that he was shooting a second music video from the album. On 14 August, he revealed in a radio interview that &quot;Black Out the Sun&quot; will be the second single from &quot;Secret Codes and Battleships&quot;. Since its release in the UK, BBC Radio 2 has selected the track to feature on their A list the week commencing 1 October 2011. He later confirmed, on Twitter, that this song will be the single for the UK and other international markets, while &quot;Bloodstained Heart&quot; would be the second single in Australia. Hayes played dates on &quot;The Secret&quot; Tour in the UK and Australia beginning on 15 October in Liverpool. Hayes tweeted, on 2 March 2012, that he would be shooting another music video the week after. He later confirmed the music video was being shot for &quot;Stupid Mistake&quot;, which was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single in May 2012.

Since 2013, Hayes stopped his music career and tried to build a stand-up comedy career. At the same time, he kept creating short singing videos in his social media accounts for his fans. In a 2022 interview with &quot;Queerty&quot;, Hayes said that he had actually planned to retire at that point. In 2018 Hayes briefly returned on stage with one-off performance of two songs, including &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;. In 2019, Hayes featured on Cub Sport&#x27;s single &quot;I Never Cried So Much in My Whole Life&quot;. He did not appear in the official video. In 2020 he recorded a new version of &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; with slightly modified lyrics. The video of his studio performance was released on YouTube on 24 April.

===2022–present: &quot;Homosexual&quot;, tour and memoir===
On 26 January 2022, Hayes released the single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Try Being in Love&quot;. A music video for the song was released the same day, starring Hayes and featuring actor Scott Evans. The video was directed by Andrew Putschoegl. Referred to as a &quot;queer anthem&quot; by &quot;NME&quot;, in promotional interviews, Hayes explained &quot;I&#x27;ve been married to Richard [Cullen] for almost 17 years, [and] I&#x27;m in this really comfortable place in my life. But at the same time at mid-life I&#x27;m grieving the fact I never got to celebrate who I really was at the period of my life where I was most famous. I look at this world we live in now where someone like Lil Nas X can push forward his true self, full of pride and self-love and have the chance to be loved for who he truly is [...] A lot of the time I was my most famous, I was deeply sad.&quot; Less than 24 hours of release, &quot;Let&#x27;s Try Being in Love&quot; debuted at number 96 on the Official UK Singles Download Chart Top 100 and at number 98 on the Official UK Singles Sales Chart Top 100. The single also peaked at number 9 on the Australian Independent singles chart. &quot;I wanted to show I love the feminine in me, be proud of the gay me. There&#x27;s a dance scene that is so passionate, everything&#x27;s alive and thriving and blooming. That&#x27;s how I feel in general about music. And that&#x27;s a hugely sharp contrast to how I felt 10 years ago.&quot;

On 27 January 2022, Hayes announced he would be headlining the 2022 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade and would be performing on 5 March 2022. Hayes performed &quot;The Animal Song&quot;, &quot;I Want You&quot;, &quot;Affirmation&quot; plus, live for the very first time, &quot;Let&#x27;s Try Being in Love&quot;.

On 2 March 2022, Hayes announced the Do You Remember? Tour that would be performed in six Australian cities between January and February 2023 and would feature songs from his musical career as part of Savage Garden and as a solo artist. On 10 March 2022, Hayes released the single &quot;Do You Remember?&quot;, following with the official video on 16 March 2022. In June 2022, Hayes released &quot;Poison Blood&quot;, which details his life living with depression, and others affected by it. Hayes released the official &quot;Poison Blood&quot; music video on 26 June 2022, announcing UK Tour dates on the same day. A remix of &quot;Let&#x27;s Try Being in Love&quot; was released on 15 July 2022, with production helmed by Louis La Roche. This was followed on 29 July by Roche&#x27;s remix to &quot;Do You Remember?&quot;.
On 18 August 2022, Hayes announced that &quot;Homosexual&quot;, his fifth studio album, would be released that October. A fourth single, &quot;All You Pretty Things&quot;, was released on 19 August 2022. When the album was released on 7 October 2022, Hayes said &quot;My new album was born from a desire to rid myself of the grief I developed over the years I lost to shame growing up in a world where being gay was met with rejection and condemnation. I wanted to revisit my teenage years with the wisdom of a proud 50-year-old gay man and revisit my youthful memories and view them through this new peach-tinted lens of joy. I imagined an adolescence where I could be loved for who I truly am today. Through this music, my goal was to reclaim my happiness and reclaim my identity. That confidence gave me the courage to explore deep wounds in my life and explore old trauma from the perspective of an effervescent endless summer.&quot; &quot;Homosexual&quot; debuted at number 6 on the Australian Digital Albums and number 16 on the Australian Artist Albums Chart. The album debuted at number 82 on the UK Albums Chart, also placing on the UK Download and Album Sales charts, placing at numbers 3 and 13, respectively.

In April 2023, Hayes graced the cover of Washington, DC&#x27;s Metro Weekly. The magazine featured a 13-page pictorial and Q&amp;A about Hayes&#x27; past career and recently-concluded Do You Remember? tour. On 10 February 2023, Peking Duk released a version of &quot;I Want You&quot; featuring re-recorded vocals by Hayes. On 1 May 2023, Hayes released an official music video for &quot;Feels Like It&#x27;s Over&quot;, directed by Andrew Huebscher. An edited version of the song was released as the fifth single from &quot;Homosexual&quot; on 12 May 2023. In June 2023, it was announced that Hayes&#x27; memoir would be published in 2024. In November 2023, Hayes competed as Grim Reaper on the fifth season of &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot;. After eight performances, he ended up in second place on the season, behind Dami Im. Hayes&#x27; memoir, &quot;Unlovable&quot;, was released on 5 November 2024.

==Other media==
In December 2014, Hayes announced a comedy podcast &quot;The He Said, He Said Show&quot;. The podcast debuted on 10 February 2015. Rosie O&#x27;Donnell has appeared as a guest. The podcast ended its run at the end of the year. Hayes has co-hosted a comedic movie review podcast with writer and comedian Anthony Armentano called &quot;We Paid to See This&quot;. Some of Hayes&#x27; sketch comedy can be found on his YouTube page including a Star Wars spoof documentary and several of his sketches he wrote and performed during his time studying at The Groundlings Theatre and School. On 13 March 2016, Hayes announced he had been writing an original musical with writer and comedian Johnny Menke. As of March 2022, the musical has yet to be publicly performed or recorded.

==Personal life==
Hayes married his childhood sweetheart, makeup artist Colby Taylor, in 1994. They were still married when Savage Garden &quot;skyrocketed to fame around the globe in the late 1990s.&quot; They separated in 1998 and were divorced in 2000. Much of the lyrics for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Affirmation&quot;, dealt with his divorce. He recorded &quot;Affirmation&quot; in San Francisco mid-1999 and eventually bought a house there. He also maintained a base in London since 2004. In 2013, Hayes moved to Los Angeles.

Hayes started coming out as gay to friends and the head of his label, Sony, in the early 2000s. He entered into a private marriage ceremony with his boyfriend of two years, Richard Cullen, on 23 July 2005, in London. On 19 June 2006, also in London, they entered into a formal civil partnership. Hayes and Cullen applied for a marriage licence in California, and were married on 15 July 2013, to show their support for those fighting for same-sex marriage. Though public speculation about his sexual orientation had been present throughout his career, he kept his personal life private. He announced the event the day prior on his official website. Before the announcement, Cullen&#x27;s name had appeared on the website as the designer of the cover for Hayes&#x27;s single &quot;So Beautiful&quot;. In a 2017 interview with &quot;Attitude&quot;, Hayes commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t regret [publicly coming out] for a second. It wasn&#x27;t that I was blacklisted, but it was that I became a &#x27;niche&#x27; artist purely based on my sexuality. There was a kind of unintentionally patronizing view of me. No longer a sexual object, but more of someone you might take home to Mom [...] I was suddenly your gay uncle. That was frustrating. My sexuality was used as a descriptor, and if you think about it, that&#x27;s nuts. No one says &#x27;Openly heterosexual singer Adele.&#x27; &quot;

In May 2023, Hayes shared a statement confirming his separation from Cullen, in which he said:

&quot;After 17 years of marriage to the best person I ever met, Richard and I have chosen to accept that our union has gently and beautifully come to rest. In honour of this realisation, we separated earlier this year and have been supporting each other emotionally throughout this massive change in our lives. Because people will ask, let me answer the ugly questions to get them out of the way forever – no, there&#x27;s no scandal to report, no infidelity, guilty or third party. It&#x27;s just life. We adore each other and always will. We view our marriage as our greatest collaboration. Nobody can ever take away what we achieved together. We are still best friends. We always will be.&quot;

Hayes announced via his Instagram on 16 September 2024, that his and Cullen&#x27;s divorce was finalised on 29 August in London.

Hayes has often been open about his mental health struggles, namely with depression, that go back to his childhood, and his depression with hiding his sexuality while in Savage Garden. &quot;I was deeply unhappy, barely containing secrets that would soon devastate me emotionally and send me to the brink of suicide at the height of my fame.&quot; While promoting his 2022 single &quot;Poison Blood&quot;, Hayes told &quot;Retro Pop Magazine&quot;: &quot;I describe my depression as a blessing, a gift and a curse all at once. I wouldn&#x27;t wish it upon my worst enemy and yet I&#x27;m aware I am a deeply sensitive person, and that my unique brain allows me to feel depths of emotions that many people don&#x27;t experience [...] I have learned to use those moments to channel melodies and stories that I hope are so real and so relatable they might reach someone else who is in pain, like me, and remind them to stay, like I choose to, every single day.&quot; In 2023, Hayes elaborated, &quot;I think we always have to remember that each one of us is essential and that we change and improve everybody&#x27;s lives. Everybody is affected positively by our place on this earth. Every time that I&#x27;ve had a thought about wishing that I wasn&#x27;t here, when the mood passes, the next day, something trivial will happen, and I think, &quot;I&#x27;m so glad I was here to witness that.&quot; And that trivial moment can be as simple as having the best mac and cheese ever, or as brilliant as Madonna releasing a new song.&quot;

Hayes is a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan, and has been since childhood. He also collects &quot;Star Wars&quot; memorabilia, and he even auditioned for a role in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;. After &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; licensed the Savage Garden song &quot;I Want You&quot; to be used in the television adaptation of &quot;Diamond Is Unbreakable&quot;, Hayes expressed his gratitude and also revealed that he is a fan of the series.

<text>Edward Mulhare (8 April 1923 – 24 May 1997) was an Irish actor whose career spanned five decades. He is best known for his starring roles in two television series, &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot; and &quot;Knight Rider&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Mulhare, one of three brothers, was born at 22 Quaker Road, Cork City, County Cork, Ireland, to John and Catherine (née Keane) Mulhare. As a child, he received his education at St. Nessan&#x27;s Christian Brothers School, and later North Monastery. Mulhare, as a young adult, began schooling at the National University of Ireland in medicine, but eventually decided upon a career in theatre. After acting in various Irish venues including the Gate Theatre in Dublin, he moved to London, where he worked with Orson Welles and John Gielgud. He co-starred with Orson Welles in a 1951 production of &quot;Othello&quot; directed by Welles and produced by Laurence Olivier, and played in &quot;Pygmalion&quot; before going to America.

In 1955 Mulhare starred as James Finnegan in the first feature film produced in Israel, &quot;Hill 24 Doesn&#x27;t Answer&quot;.

His best-known stage role was as Professor Higgins in the original Broadway production of &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; having taken over the role from Rex Harrison in 1957. Mulhare was understudy to Harrison until that time, going on to play the part for three years in New York for 1,000 performances, then continuing the role on an international tour, which included an extensive tour of Russia. He continued to perform the role in summer theatres and for touring companies into the 1970s. A notable East Lansing, Michigan university campus performance of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; was originally cancelled due to a blizzard, but played to a packed house of 4,000 when word was sent out that any student could get into the performance free, if they could get there. Many showed up on skis, as told by Mulhare and Anne Rogers on &quot;The Irv Kupcinet Show&quot; in a 1978 interview. Mulhare and Rogers continued their acting partnership, playing King Arthur and Guenevere in &quot;Camelot&quot;.

==Television==
His first television appearance was in 1956 in a production of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (Episode &quot;The Imposters&quot;). He was a guest panelist in 1958, and again in 1963, on the CBS television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; 

By 1965, he was back in Hollywood appearing in films and television shows for 20th Century Fox. He earned roles in the films &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; in 1965, &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; in 1966, and &quot;Caprice&quot; in 1967. He guest-starred in television programmes, including &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; and the &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; episode &quot;Siren Voices&quot; as Luftwaffe Colonel Kurt Halland. In &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot;, a supernatural sitcom that ran from 1968 to 1970, he starred as Captain Daniel Gregg, and again was something of a successor to Rex Harrison, who had originated the role of Captain Gregg in the original 1947 film.

In 1969 Mulhare starred in &quot;Gidget Grows Up&quot;, an American made-for-television comedy film with Karen Valentine in the title role. He played Alex MacLaughlin, a love interest for Gidget. Harlan Carraher, who played Jonathan Muir in &quot;The Ghost and Mrs Muir&quot; with Mulhare, had a small part as well.

He also guest-starred in &quot;Experiment In Terra&quot;, an episode of the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

Mulhare co-starred as Devon Miles, director of the Foundation for Law and Government, on &quot;Knight Rider&quot; (1982–1986) alongside David Hasselhoff&#x27;s Michael Knight.

In the mid-1980s, Mulhare hosted the television series &quot;Secrets &amp; Mysteries,&quot; also called &quot;Secrets of the Unknown,&quot; a magazine show that examined historical mysteries and the paranormal.

==Later years==
He starred in a number of films in his career including &quot;Megaforce&quot; and &quot;Out to Sea&quot;. His final role was on &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot; alongside former &quot;Knight Rider&quot; co-star David Hasselhoff in December 1996.

==Death==
A heavy smoker, he died of lung cancer on 24 May 1997, aged 74, at his home in Van Nuys, California. He had been battling the cancer for five months prior to his death. &quot;Team Knight Rider&quot; dedicated an episode titled &quot;K.R.O.&quot;, to Mulhare&#x27;s memory (broadcast 27 October 1997). According to the annual magazine &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in TV, 1968-1969&quot;, Mulhare was &quot;a real ladies&#x27; man&quot;; however, he remained a lifelong bachelor. He is buried in St. Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery, Tory Top Road, Cork City, Ireland.

<doc id="398841" wikidata="Q65432" url="?curid=398841" title="Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg">
<text>Johann David Ludwig Graf Yorck von Wartenburg (born von Yorck; 26 September 1759 – 4 October 1830) was a Prussian &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; instrumental in the Kingdom of Prussia ending an alliance with France to form one with Russia during the War of the Sixth Coalition. Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Yorckscher Marsch&quot; is named in his honor.

The Field Marshal&#x27;s surname is Yorck; Wartenburg is a battle-honour appended to the surname as a title of distinction (cf. Britain&#x27;s Montgomery of Alamein).

==Background==

Yorck&#x27;s father, David Jonathan von Yorck, was born in Rowe in the Prussian Province of Pomerania (now Rowy, Poland), to Jan Jarka, a Lutheran pastor, whose family came from a small manor in Gross Gustkow (hence the name &quot;von Gostkowski&quot;) and traced its origins from Pomeranian Kashubians. David Jonathan von Yorck served as a captain (&quot;Hauptmann&quot;) in the Prussian Army under King Frederick the Great; Yorck&#x27;s mother Maria Sophia Pflug was the daughter of a Potsdam artisan. Their son Ludwig was born in Potsdam in 1759; the couple married in 1763. Ludwig&#x27;s father changed his name from &quot;Jark(a)&quot; to &quot;Yorck&quot; to make it more English (York) and dropped the &quot;von Gostkowski&quot;.

==Career==

Yorck entered the Prussian Army in 1772 and reached the rank of lieutenant in 1777. After seven years&#x27; service, however, he was cashiered for insubordination, having reproached his superior for plundering during the War of the Bavarian Succession when in 1779, during the Guard Parade, Yorck expressed his contempt for him. He spent one year&#x27;s confinement in Fort Friedrichsburg, Königsberg, after which King Frederick the Great denied him re-employment.

Yorck left Prussia and joined the Swiss mercenaries in Dutch service in 1781. He took part in the operations of 1783-84 in the East Indies as a captain of the Regiment de Meuron. He also participated with the French army in a battle against the British in Cape Town. Returning to Potsdam in 1786 he was, on the death of Frederick the Great, reinstated in the army by Frederick William II, from 1792 with the rank of major. In 1794/95 he participated in the operations in Poland during the Kościuszko Uprising, distinguishing himself especially in the Szczekociny.

From 1799, Yorck began to make a name for himself as commander of a light infantry (&quot;Jäger&quot;) regiment, being one of the first to emphasize the training of skirmishers. In 1805, with the rank of &quot;Oberst&quot;, he was appointed to command an infantry brigade as a vanguard force of Duke Karl August of Saxe-Weimar during the War of the Fourth Coalition. In the disastrous Jena campaign, he was a conspicuous and successful rearguard commander, especially at Altenzaun. Having crossed the Elbe river and Harz mountains, he was taken prisoner, severely wounded, in the last stand of Blücher&#x27;s corps at Lübeck.

In the reorganization of the Prussian army which followed the 1807 Treaty of Tilsit, Yorck was one of the leading figures. At first major-general commanding the West Prussian brigade, afterwards inspector-general of light infantry, he was finally appointed second in command to General Grawert, the leader of the auxiliary corps which Prussia was compelled to send in support of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia. The two generals did not agree, Grawert being an open partisan of the French alliance, and Yorck an ardent Prussian patriot, but Grawert soon retired and Yorck assumed the command.

Opposed in his advance on Riga by the Russian General Steingell, Yorck displayed great skill in a series of battles which ended in the retreat of the enemy to Riga. Throughout the campaign he had been the object of many overtures from the enemy&#x27;s generals, and though he had hitherto rejected them, it was soon clear to him that the French Grand Army was doomed. Marshal MacDonald, his immediate French superior, retreated before the corps of Diebitsch, and Yorck found himself isolated. As a soldier his duty was to break through, but as a Prussian patriot his position was more difficult. He had to judge whether the moment was favorable for the war of Prussia&#x27;s liberation; and, whatever might be the enthusiasm of his junior staff officers, Yorck had no illusions as to the safety of his own head. On 20 December, the general made up his mind.

The Convention of Tauroggen armistice, signed by Diebitsch and Yorck without the consent of their king, declared the Prussian corps &quot;neutral&quot;. The news was received with the wildest enthusiasm, but the Prussian Court dared not yet throw off the mask, and an order was despatched suspending Yorck from his command pending a court-martial. Diebitsch refused to let the bearer pass through his lines, and the general was finally absolved when the Treaty of Kalisz placed Prussia on the side of the Allies. Yorck&#x27;s act was nothing less than the turning-point of Prussian history. His veterans formed the nucleus of the forces of East Prussia, and Yorck himself in public took the final step by declaring war on Napoleon as the commander of those forces.

On 17 March 1813, Yorck made his entry into Berlin in the midst of the wildest exuberance of patriotic joy. On the same day, the king declared war on France. During 1813-14, Yorck led his veterans with conspicuous success. He covered Blücher&#x27;s retreat after Bautzen and took a decisive part in the battles on the Katzbach. In the advance on Leipzig, his corps won the action of Wartenburg (3 October) and took part in the crowning victory in the Battle of the Nations of 18 October. In the campaign in France, Yorck drew off the shattered remnants of Osten-Sacken&#x27;s corps at Montmirail, and decided the day at Laon.

The storming of Paris was Yorck&#x27;s last fight. In the campaign of 1815, none of the older men were employed in Blücher&#x27;s army, in order that August von Gneisenau might be free to assume command in case of the old prince&#x27;s death. Yorck was appointed to a reserve corps in Prussia, and, feeling that his services were no longer required, he retired from the army. His master would not accept his resignation for a considerable time, and in 1821 made him Generalfeldmarschall. He had been made &quot;Graf&quot; Yorck von Wartenburg in 1814. The remainder of his life was spent on his estate of Klein-Öls (today Oleśnica Mała, Poland) in Silesia, a gift of the king. A statue by Christian Daniel Rauch was erected in Yorck&#x27;s honor in Berlin in 1855. The former football club Yorck Boyen Insterburg was also named in honor of Yorck.

A 1931 film &quot;Yorck&quot; was made about him with Werner Krauss playing the General.

==Notable descendants==
Yorck was the great-grandfather of the late-nineteenth-century philosopher Paul Yorck von Wartenburg and the great-great-great-grandfather of Peter Yorck von Wartenburg, a member of the German resistance during the Nazi regime.

<text>Christian Daniel Rauch (2 January 1777 – 3 December 1857) was a German sculptor. He founded the Berlin school of sculpture, and was the foremost German sculptor of the 19th century.

==Life==
Rauch was born at Arolsen in the Principality of Waldeck in the Holy Roman Empire. His father was employed at the court of Prince Frederick II of Hesse, and in 1790 the lad was apprenticed to the court sculptor of Arolsen, Friedrich Valentin. In 1795, he became assistant to Johann Christian Ruhl, the court sculptor of Kassel. After the death of his father in 1796 and his older brother in 1797, he moved to Berlin where he was appointed groom of the chamber in the king&#x27;s household. He abandoned sculpture temporarily, but his new position provided a wider field for improvement, and he soon used the opportunity and practiced his art in his spare hours. He came under the influence of Johann Gottfried Schadow.

In 1802, he exhibited his &quot;Sleeping Endymion.&quot; Queen Louisa of Prussia, surprising him one day in the act of modeling her features in wax, sent him to study at the Prussian Academy of Art. Not long afterward, in 1804, Count Sandrecky gave Rauch the means to complete his education at Rome, where Wilhelm von Humboldt, Antonio Canova and Bertel Thorvaldsen befriended him. He also executed his life-size bust of Queen Louise in marble, and among his other early works were busts of the poet Zacharias Werner, Count Wengersky and the painter Raphael Mengs, the latter executed on a commission from Ludwig I of Bavaria. Other works were bas-reliefs of &quot;Hippolytus and Phaedra,&quot; &quot;Mars and Venus wounded by Diomede,&quot; and a &quot;Child praying.&quot; He remained in Rome for six years.

In 1811, Rauch was commissioned to execute a monument for Queen Louisa of Prussia. The statue, representing the queen in a sleeping posture, was placed in a mausoleum in the grounds of Charlottenburg and procured great fame and a European reputation for the artist. A similar statue of the Queen, even more successful, was placed in the Sanssouci Park at Potsdam. The erection of nearly all public statues came to be entrusted to him. There were, among others, Bülow, Yorck and Scharnhorst at Berlin, Blücher at Breslau, Maximilian at Munich, Francke at Halle, Dürer at Nuremberg, Luther at Wittenberg, and Grand Duke Paul Friedrich at Schwerin.

By 1824, he had executed 70 busts in marble of which 20 were of colossal size. His colossal bronze statues of Blücher are 13 feet in height, and he also executed the greater part of the 12 statues in iron which compose the National Monument for the Liberation Wars on the Kreuzberg, near Berlin. One of his finest works is the group &quot;Faith, Hope and Charity,&quot; which he presented to his native town, Arolsen.

At length, in 1830, Rauch began, along with the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the models for a colossal equestrian monument at Berlin to honor King Frederick II of Prussia (Frederick the Great). This work was inaugurated with great pomp in May 1851, and is regarded as one of the masterpieces of modern sculpture, the crowning achievement of Rauch&#x27;s work as a portrait and historic sculptor. Princes decorated Rauch with honors and the academies of Europe enrolled him among their members. A statue of Immanuel Kant for Königsberg and a statue of Albrecht Thaer for Berlin occupied his attention during some of his last years; and he had just finished a model of Moses praying between Aaron and Hur when he was attacked by his last illness. In 1837 Rauch became associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. He died at Dresden, aged 80.

<text>Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler software project.

== Features ==

Nutch is coded entirely in the Java programming language, but data is written in language-independent formats. It has a highly modular architecture, allowing developers to create plug-ins for media-type parsing, data retrieval, querying and clustering.

The fetcher (&quot;robot&quot; or &quot;web crawler&quot;) has been written from scratch specifically for this project.

== History ==
Nutch originated with Doug Cutting, creator of both Lucene and Hadoop, and Mike Cafarella.

In June, 2003, a successful 100-million-page demonstration system was developed. To meet the multi-machine processing needs of the crawl and index tasks, the Nutch project has also implemented the MapReduce project and a distributed file system. The two projects have been spun out into their own subproject, called Hadoop.

In January, 2005, Nutch joined the Apache Incubator, from which it graduated to become a subproject of Lucene in June of that same year. Since April, 2010, Nutch has been considered an independent, top level project of the Apache Software Foundation.

In February 2014 the Common Crawl project adopted Nutch for its open, large-scale web crawl.

While it was once a goal for the Nutch project to release a global large-scale web search engine, that is no longer the case.

===Release history===
==Scalability==
IBM Research studied the performance of Nutch/Lucene as part of its Commercial Scale Out (CSO) project. Their findings were that a scale-out system, such as Nutch/Lucene, could achieve a performance level on a cluster of blades that was not achievable on any scale-up computer such as the POWER5.

The ClueWeb09 dataset (used in e.g. TREC) was gathered using Nutch, with an average speed of 755.31 documents per second.

<doc id="398859" wikidata="Q1308730" url="?curid=398859" title="Thomas Hope (designer)">
<text>Thomas Hope (30 August 17692 February 1831) was a Dutch-British interior and Regency designer, traveler, author, philosopher, art collector, and partner in the banking firm Hope &amp; Co. He is best known as an early promoter of Greek Revival architecture, opening his house as a museum and his novel &quot;Anastasius&quot;, a work which many experts considered a rival to the writings of Lord Byron.

Born in Amsterdam, he fled to London after the French Revolution spread to the Netherlands, leaving a large part of his art collection behind.

== Early life and family ==

The eldest son of Jan Hope, Thomas descended from a branch of an old Scottish family (Quakers) who for several generations were merchant bankers known as the Hopes of Amsterdam, or Hope &amp; Co. He was baptized on 3 September in the English Reformed Church, Amsterdam. He had two brothers, Adrian Elias (1772-–834), an innovative gardener, and Henry Philip (1774-–839), a collector of gems and jewelry. Hope was possibly painted as a boy by Guy Head who visited Amsterdam cin 780. Thomas inherited a love of the arts from his parents. His father spent his final years turning his summer home ,Groenendaal Park in Heemstede into a grand park of sculpture which would be open to the public.

==Grand tour==
In 1784, when Thomas was fifteen, his father died unexpectedly in the Hague right after purchasing Bosbeek, the mansion that would later house his large art collection. He shared his art collection as part of the Hope &amp; Co. partnership with his cousin Henry Hope.

At the age of eighteen, Thomas began to devote most of his time to the study of the arts, especially classical architecture. During his eight-year grand tour through Europe, Asia and Africa, Thomas became especially interested in architecture and sculpture, collecting a large collection of artifacts that attracted his attention (e.g. the Hope Dionysus).

Not long after his mother died in early January 1790, Thomas received the rights and liabilities of a person of full age and was admitted to the board of the Hope company. He owned almost a sixth of the shares, and instantly became a millionaire. Between 1792 and 1794 he and Henry Philip traveled in Italy, buying antiquities (Venus, restored by Antonio Canova).

Henry Hope was the executor of their mother&#x27;s will in June 1794; Thomas received the largest and most expensive mansion on Herengracht. On 24 December 1794 he crashed in the Watergraafsmeer with another chaise. (On 27, the French general Pichegru crossed the Meuse on the ice and moved north.) Within a few weeks, he fled to London to avoid the Batavian Revolution and the French occupation of the Netherlands and never returned.

==Escape to London==

The Hope brothers, under the protection of their uncle, took 372 paintings with them. Among these were important works by Frans Hals, Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt and Sir Anthony van Dyck.

The Hopes left their mansions, full of wall decorations, furniture, and heavy statuary. Henry settled at the corner of Harley Street and Cavendish Square, Thomas at Hanover Square. Later in 1795, the brothers went to Rome.

In 1802, their younger brother, Adrian Elias, who had been declared insane, would return to live at Groenendaal Park and expand the gardens. The brothers sold the real estate at Keizersgracht and Prinsengracht to John Williams Hope. Henry also sold Villa Welgelegen to this fiduciary, who continued to hold that office until the establishment of the monarchy under Louis Bonaparte in 1806.

==Career as an interior decorator==

In 1799, the Hopes established a residence in London in Duchess Street, off Portland Place, designed by Robert Adam. Thomas remodeled it in an Egyptian style. Experienced from his extensive travel, Thomas Hope enjoyed the cosmopolitan atmosphere of London, while his younger brothers missed their home in the Netherlands. He decorated the mansion in a very elaborate style, from drawings made himself with each room taking on a different style influenced by the countries he had visited. In essence, the combined art collections of Hope &amp; Co., his parents and Henry Hope gave him the opportunity to further research the various art he had studied during his travels. Thomas began to write books on decoration and furniture, the first of its kind.

In this eclectic wealthy residence of bachelors, younger brother Henry Philip oversaw the gem collection (acquiring the Hope Diamond and the Hope Pearl), while cousin Henry busied himself with the banking business and the Louisiana Purchase, together with Barings. Thomas Hope did not &quot;settle&quot; in London, however. He took up his grand tour where he left off, and in 1796 he began his extensive tours of the Ottoman Empire, which included visits to Turkey, Rhodes, Egypt, Syria, and Arabia. He stayed for about a year in Constantinople and produced some 350 drawings depicting the people and places he witnessed, a collection now to be found in the Benaki Museum, Athens.

In 1801, he bought a collection of Greek vases from William Hamilton. During these travels, he was given free rein by the Hope &amp; Co. firm to collect many paintings, sculptures, antique objects and books, some of which were destined to be displayed for the public in Amsterdam in the branch offices on Keizersgracht 444, and some of which were destined for his London house in Duchess Street in 1804.

During the Treaty of Amiens he started to travel again. In 1803, he ordered Jason with the Golden Fleece, a sculpture by Thorvaldsen in Copenhagen City Hall, included in the semi-official Danish Culture Canon. Thomas Hope first opened his new galleries to the public, on 10 February 1804.

The Egyptian Gallery, a private room in the home of Thomas Hope to display his Egyptian antiquities, and illustrated in engravings from his meticulous line drawings in his book &quot;Household Furniture&quot; (1807), were a prime source for the Regency style of British furnishings.

==Marriage and move to Deepdene==

After his marriage to Louisa de la Poer Beresford (daughter of William Beresford, 1st Baron Decies) in 1806, Hope acquired a country seat at Deepdene, near Dorking in Surrey. Here, surrounded by his large collections of paintings, sculptures and antiques, Deepdene became a famous resort of men of letters as well as of people of fashion. Among the luxuries suggested by his fine taste, and provided to his guests, was a miniature library in several languages in each bedroom.

He also gave frequent employment to artists, sculptors and craftsmen. Bertel Thorvaldsen, the Danish sculptor, was indebted to him for the early recognition of his talents. He was also a patron to Francis Legatt Chantrey and John Flaxman; it was to his order that the latter illustrated the writings of Dante Alighieri. He developed the gardens in a particular version of picturesque style.

Hope was noted for his snobbery and ugliness, one contemporary describing him as &quot;undoubtedly far from the most agreeable man in Europe. He is a little ill-looking man…with an effeminate face and manner.&quot; When the French painter Antoine Dubost exhibited a portrait of him titled &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, portraying him as a monster offering his wife jewels, it caused a public scandal: the painting was mutilated by Louisa&#x27;s brother. A further scandal arose in 1810 when Hope took up with a beautiful young Greek sailor, Aide, and attempted to launch him into Society.

Hope was the father of Henry Thomas Hope, art patron and politician and Alexander James Beresford Beresford Hope, author and politician.

==Writing==

Hope was eager to advance public awareness of historical painting and design and to influence design in the grand houses of Regency London. In pursuit of his scholarly projects, he began sketching furniture, room interiors and costumes, and publishing books with his accompanying scholarly texts.

In 1807 Thomas Hope published sketches of his furniture, in a folio volume, titled &quot;Household Furniture and Interior Decoration&quot;, which had considerable influence and brought about a change in the upholstery and interior decoration of houses. Hope&#x27;s furniture designs were in the pseudo-classical manner generally called &quot;English Empire&quot;. It was sometimes extravagant, and often heavy, but was much more restrained than the wilder and later flights of Thomas Sheraton in this style.

In 1809 he published the &quot;Costumes of the Ancients&quot;, and in 1812 &quot;Designs of Modern Costumes&quot;, works which display a large amount of antiquarian research. &quot;A Historical Essay on Architecture,&quot; which featured illustrations based on early Hope drawings, was published posthumously by his family in 1835. Thus Hope became famous in London&#x27;s aristocratic circles as &#x27;the costume and furniture man&#x27;. The sobriquet was regarded as a compliment by his enthusiastic supporters, but for his critics, including Lord Byron, it was a term of ridicule.

===Anastasius===


At age fifty, Hope began work on a novel at the suggestion of a few friends. The first edition of Anastasius was complete in 1819 and was published by London publisher John Murray. It received foreign translations into French, German and Flemish.

The novel lifted a curtain of ignorance about the East without being a mere retelling of Hope&#x27;s own travels. The eponymous narrator-hero Anastasius was fearless, curious, cunning, ruthless, brave and, above all, sexy. As a newly converted Muslim mercenary soldier, Selim, his travels threw him among friends, lovers and enemies.

The novel described the lives of the inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire and the wars fought among the Turks, Russians and Wahabees. It also included many previously unfamiliar details of Islamic culture: music, language, cuisine, religion, laws and literature.

Because of his modesty, Hope originally chose not to declare his authorship of &quot;Anastasius&quot; in the first edition. Ironically, given Hope&#x27;s mild reputation, the authorship of the dashing &quot;Anastasius&quot; was at first mistakenly attributed to Lord Byron, who, according to legend, confided to Marguerite, Countess of Blessington, that he wept bitterly on reading it. &quot;To have been the author of &quot;Anastasius,&quot; I would have given the two poems which brought me the most glory.&quot; These events prompted Hope to reveal his identity as author in later editions, adding a map of Anastasius&#x27;s travels and fine-tuning the text, although his authorship was initially greeted with incredulity by some journals.

Soon after Hope&#x27;s death in 1831, his widow Louisa remarried her cousin William Carr Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford. His family thereafter embraced conservative values, causing them to authorise the demolition of the writer&#x27;s legendary London home, disperse his fabled art collection, and distance themselves from his Oriental masterpiece. No substantial collection of Hope&#x27;s personal papers survived the family indifference and &quot;Anastasius,&quot; his magnum opus, became a victim of the sanctimonious morality of the Victorian age.

Nevertheless, it influenced the later works of William Thackeray, Mark Twain and Herman Melville. More recently, the noted Orientalist Robert Irwin wrote, &quot;this book, one of the most important books of the nineteenth century, should be much more widely read.&quot;

In addition to his other accomplishments, Hope was the author of an important philosophical work published posthumously, &quot;The Origin and Prospect of Man&quot; (1831), in which his speculations diverged widely from the social and religious views of the Victorian age. This volume, which has been cited by the philosopher Roger Scruton, was a highly eclectic work and took a global view of the challenges facing humanity.

In his obituary published in &quot;The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction&quot; Volume 17, No. 476, Saturday, 12 February 1831, it was written, &quot;We remember the opinion of a writer in the Edinburgh Review, soon after the publication of &quot;Anastasius&quot;. With a degree of pleasantry and acumen peculiar to northern criticism, he asks, &#x27;Where has Mr. Hope hidden all his eloquence and poetry up to this hour? How is it that he has, all of a sudden, burst out into descriptions which would not disgrace the pen of Tacitus, and displayed a depth of feeling and vigor of imagination which Lord Byron could not excel? We do not shrink from one syllable of this eulogy.&#x27;&quot;

Still commonly known among literary circles as &quot;Anastasius Hope&quot;, the combined artistic legacy of Thomas Hope is still of universal interest and importance.

==Death and legacy==

In early 1831, Hope fell ill. He died on 2 February at Duchess Street and was laid to rest on 12 February in the mausoleum at Deepdene.

The two mansions Hope created have been lost; that in Duchess Street was demolished by his son in 1851 and Deepdene in 1969. The only complete surviving structure built by Hope is the Deepdene mausoleum. Built in 1818, the structure was the first recorded work at Deepdene. It was permanently sealed in 1957 and buried in 1960. The Mausolea and Monuments Trust has been working with Mole Valley District Council to rescue the structure and is running a campaign to excavate and repair it.

The principal elevation was excavated in 2013, with further restoration in 2016.

<text>The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich is an establishment on the south bank of the River Thames in Woolwich in south-east London, England, that was used for the manufacture of armaments and ammunition, proofing, and explosives research for the British armed forces. It was originally known as the Woolwich Warren, having begun on land previously used as a domestic warren in the grounds of a mid-16th century Tudor house, Tower Place. Much of the initial history of the site is linked with that of the Office of Ordnance, which purchased the Warren in the late 17th century in order to expand an earlier base at Gun Wharf in Woolwich Dockyard.

Over the next two centuries, as operations grew and innovations were pursued, the site expanded massively. At the time of the First World War the Arsenal covered and employed close to 80,000 people. Thereafter its operations were scaled down. It finally closed as a factory in 1967 and the Ministry of Defence moved out in 1994. Today the area, so long a secret enclave, is open to the public and is being redeveloped for housing and community use.

==17th-century origins: the Gun Wharf and Tower Place==

The Royal Arsenal had its origins in a domestic warren at Tower Place in Old Woolwich. Tower Place was a Tudor mansion built in the 1540s for Martin Bowes, a wealthy goldsmith and merchant, later Lord Mayor of London. The house with its octagonal tower stood nearby Gun Wharf (the original site of Woolwich Dockyard where the &quot;Henry Grace à Dieu&quot; had been built around 1515). After the Dockyard moved west in the 1540s, Gun Wharf was acquired by the Office of Ordnance and mainly used for gun storage.

In 1651, the owners of Tower Place gave the board permission to prove its guns on the warren that formed part of their land. That same year the first proof butts were built on the site, under the board&#x27;s direction (24 years later they were enlarged, to enable more guns to be proved at each firing).

===Purchase of the site===
In 1667, in response to the raid on the Medway, a gun battery (known as Prince Rupert&#x27;s Battery, being under the command of the King&#x27;s cousin) was built in the grounds of the house, designed to defend London in the event of a similar raid on the Thames. The following year, Tower Place was acquired by Sir William Pritchard who promptly entered into negotiations to sell it to the Board of Ordnance; and in 1671, the estate was given to the board in exchange for the Gun Wharf and a substantial amount of cash. The board at the time declared the site to be &quot;a convenient place for building a storehouse for powder and other stores of war, and for room for the proof of guns&quot;. The first Storekeeper, Captain Francis Cheeseman, was appointed in 1670 by Warrant of the Master-General of the Ordnance.

===Proof and experiment===
In 1681, King Charles II visited the Warren and observed Richard Leake, Master Gunner of England, conduct an experiment with fire-shot in the proof butts. In 1682 what had till then been the board&#x27;s main proving ground (in &#x27;Old Artillery Garden&#x27; near its headquarters in the Tower of London) was closed and its staff and activities were promptly moved to Tower Place. That year a thousand cannon and ten thousand cannonballs were sent to Woolwich from the Tower, and the proof butts were further expanded.

When the constitution of the Board of Ordnance was formalised by Charles II in 1683, two Proof Masters were appointed, under the Surveyor-General of the Ordnance, to ensure that proofs and trials were conducted correctly and the results duly certified. In 1684 the King paid another visit, when Leake conducted a trial of his newly-developed mortar design.

===Centralisation of ordnance stores===
In 1688 it was ordered that &#x27;all guns, carriages and stores now at Deptford, be removed to Woolwich, and from henceforth new ordnance and carriages be laid there&#x27;. No manufacturing took place at this stage, however, except for the periodical production of fireworks for state celebrations; (between 1681 and 1694 saltpetre, a key ingredient of gunpowder, was regularly refined on the site).

In due course, the site as a whole became known as The Warren.

==18th century: The Warren==

The Board of Ordnance was both a civil and a military office of State, independent of the Army, overseen by a high-ranking official, the Master-General of the Ordnance. Both branches, civil and military, were represented at the Warren; indeed there was a great deal of overlap: military officers for the most part headed up the civil departments, and civilians often worked alongside the military personnel.

===The civil establishment===
For most of its history, the civil establishment of the Warren/Arsenal consisted of the following four departments:
* The Storekeeper&#x27;s Department (which managed storage of all kinds of &#x27;warlike stores&#x27;)
* The Royal Laboratory (which manufactured ammunition of all kinds, for small arms as well as artillery)
* The Royal Brass Foundry (which manufactured artillery pieces and was later renamed the Royal Gun Factory)
* The Royal Carriage Department (which manufactured gun carriages)
In addition, proof butts continued to be maintained by the Board of Ordnance to test guns beyond their normal operational limits and for experimenting with new types of ammunition.

====The storekeeper&#x27;s department====

First and foremost, the Warren was established as an storage depot. As at the board&#x27;s other depots, the site was overseen by an official called the storekeeper, who was provided with an official residence in Tower Place itself. The Storekeeper not only controlled the receipt, safekeeping and issue of all the items that were stored on the site; he was also responsible (until the early 1800s) for issuing payments on the board&#x27;s behalf to all personnel across the different departments. He was assisted by a clerk of the cheque, clerk of the survey and other administrative staff.

To begin with much of the Warren was preserved as open space with cannons stored in the open air and guns proved on ranges to the east. (Proof-testing was overseen at this time by the Master Gunner of England, who was also accommodated in Tower Place.) Gunpowder was stored in a converted dovecote initially; but before long specialist buildings began to appear.

====The Royal Laboratory====

An ammunition laboratory (i.e. workshop) was set up at the Warren in 1695, overseen by the Comptroller of Fireworks. Manufacture of ammunition had previously taken place within a Great Barn on the tilt-yard at Greenwich Palace (an offshoot of the royal armoury there); but in 1695 construction of Greenwich Hospital began on the palace site, so the laboratory was relocated downstream at Woolwich (the barn building itself was even disassembled and rebuilt at the Warren). In 1696 Laboratory Square was built to house its operations, which included manufacture of gunpowder, shell cases, fuses and paper gun cartridges; it consisted of a quadrangle with a gateway at the north end, buildings along either side and a clock tower at the south end, beyond which further buildings were ranged. The manufacturing process was conducted by hand, overseen by a Chief Firemaster; early paintings show artisans at work in the courtyards among pyramid stacks of shells. A pair of pavilions, which once faced each other across the centre of the courtyard, are now the oldest surviving buildings on the Arsenal site; they were being restored for residential use in 2013.

The Comptroller, Royal Laboratory, had oversight of the Royal Gunpowder Mills in addition to the Woolwich manufactory. From time to time there were public demonstrations of the work of the Laboratory, often in Hyde Park, and by the mid-18th century it was customary for the Royal Laboratory to provide an official &#x27;fireworks display&#x27; on occasions such as coronations, peace treaties, royal jubilees etc.

====The Royal Brass Foundry====

A gun foundry, overseen by a Master Founder, was established in 1717. (The decision of the Board of Ordnance to set up and supervise its own foundry operations followed a devastating explosion at the private foundry it had previously used in Moorfields.) In Woolwich, the original Royal Brass Foundry building survives (built on the site of the relocated &quot;Greenwich Barn&quot;). Its handsome exterior encloses a space designed for pure industrial functionality, with height to accommodate a vertical boring machine, and tall doors permitting easy removal of newly made cannons.

Completed guns could then be taken through what is now Dial Arch into a complex known as the &#x27;Great Pile of buildings&#x27; (built 1717-20) to be finished and stored. Behind the surviving frontage and archway was a small courtyard in which the newly forged guns were turned, washed and engraved; beyond which two large gun-carriage storehouses stood (one for the Navy, one for the Army) at either end of a larger quadrangle, with workshops alongside.
The first Master Founder, Andrew Schalch, served in post for 54 years before retiring in 1769 at the age of 78. In 1770 a revolutionary horse-powered horizontal boring machine was installed in the Foundry by his successor, Jan Verbruggen which inspired Henry Maudslay (who worked at the foundry from 1783) to his inventions improving the lathe. Remarkably, it remained in use until 1843 when a steam-powered equivalent replaced it.

From 1780 a new official, the Inspector of Artillery, was given oversight of the Royal Brass Foundry and of other aspects of gun manufacture including carriage-making (for the time being) and proof-testing, which continued to take place on ranges to the east; (over the next hundred years the proof ranges were moved progressively further eastwards as the Arsenal continued to expand).

====The carriage works====

From the beginning, gun carriages had been stored at the Warren (unlike the guns themselves the wooden carriages had to be kept under cover). The first store (&#x27;Old Carriage Yard&#x27;) had been built as early as 1682, and probably also contained workshops for the repair or scrapping of old carriages. In 1697 a far larger complex of sheds (&#x27;New Carriage Yard&#x27;) was built on what had been Prince Rupert&#x27;s gun battery.

By the 1750s manufacture of gun carriages was also taking place on site, overseen by the Constructor of Carriages. This took place around New Carriage Square (a low quadrangle of storehouses built alongside, and as an extension of, the Great Pile storehouses in 1728–1729). In 1803 this activity was formalized as the Royal Carriage Department, a recognition of the importance of effective carriage design and manufacture, alongside that of guns and ammunition, as part of ordnance provision.

===The military establishment===
By 1700 the Board of Ordnance had a team of 20 gunners stationed in the Warren, overseen by the Master Gunner of England, who (except in time of war) assisted in the manufacture as well as the proving of cannons. Building, repair and technical work was undertaken by the board&#x27;s (civil) artificers, who were drafted in from the Tower of London as and when required. In many respects &#x27;there was no distinction between the Ordnance soldier and the Ordnance civilian&#x27; at this time, and a close working relationship endured between the two constituencies across subsequent decades.

The military constitution of the Board of Ordnance was strengthened when, on 26 May 1716, a Royal Warrant directed that two companies of artillery (of a hundred men each, plus officers) and a separate corps of twenty-six military engineers (all officers) be formed on a permanent basis: this marked the foundation of the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers. Both had their headquarters in the Warren for a time and (when not mobilized for war) they were regularly engaged in its work.

====The regiment of artillery====

The two companies of artillery (referred to as &#x27;Royal Artillery&#x27; by 1720) were quartered and based at the Warren. By 1722 the detachment had grown and was formally named the Royal Regiment of Artillery. These troops (who were not under the command of the Army but of the Board of Ordnance) provided a versatile workforce on site, as well as helping ensure its security. In 1719 they were provided with their own barracks within the compound, close to Dial Arch: a single block was built, housing 200 men in open barracks accommodation across four floors, with a pair of officers&#x27; houses incorporated at each end. (This block has since been demolished, but an identical block (now known as Building 11), survives; it was built alongside the first in 1739–1740, the Regiment having been enlarged).

After the formation of the Regiment in 1716, the Royal Artillery took on responsibility for conducting proof tests and the (recently renamed) post of Master Gunner of Great Britain was abolished. Proving guns at the Warren became part of routine training for gunners of the Royal Artillery, overseen at first by the Board&#x27;s proofmaster-general (and then, after 1780, by the Inspector of Artillery). In addition to the proof butts, a range was set up in 1787 for gunnery practice, firing parallel to the river across Plumstead Marshes.

====The Corps of Engineers====
An Order in Council (dated 22 August 1717) increased the size of the Engineer Corps to fifty officers (including the Chief Engineer). Serving under the Board of Ordnance, they received their commissions from the Master-General until 1757 when the King granted them commission and rank equivalent to officers of the Army. In a Royal Warrant of 1787 the Corps (which was still composed solely of officers) was renamed the Corps of Royal Engineers.

Initially, civilians were employed as workers, but in 1787 a Corps of Royal Military Artificers was formed: a body of non-commissioned officers and men who were placed under the command of officers from the Corps of Royal Engineers. From 1795 both these Corps were headquartered in the Warren; alongside their other duties, they had responsibility for the design, construction and maintenance of buildings, wharves and other features across the Arsenal site.

====The Royal Military Academy====

In 1720, the Board sought to establish an on-site military academy for the education of its Artillery and Engineer officers. Tower Place had by this time largely been demolished, and a new building was erected in its place to provide a base for the new academy alongside a Board Room for the Ordnance Board (with a new residence for the Storekeeper added to the rear). It would not be until 1741, however, that the Royal Military Academy was set up on a firm footing and occupied its rooms in the building. Soon, the Academy&#x27;s cadets were given their own purpose-built barracks alongside the southern boundary wall; dating from 1751, these were entirely demolished in the 1980s for road widening.
====The Royal Military Repository====
An offshoot of the Academy was the Royal Military Repository. In the 1770s Captain William Congreve built a &quot;Repository for Military Machines&quot; between New Carriage Square and some open ground to the east. The building housed an educative display of cannons and mortars, and the open space was used as a training ground to help develop skills in handling large artillery pieces on various terrains in different conflict scenarios.

====The Ordnance Field Train====
In 1792, with Britain on the cusp of war with France, the Board of Ordnance established a Field Train department to ensure supply and storage of guns, ammunition and other equipment for its Artillery and Engineers serving in the field of battle. The small corps (which had its headquarters in the Arsenal) was composed of a permanent cadre of officers, who were supplemented at time of war by uniformed civilians (many of whom were volunteers recruited from the ordnance storekeeper&#x27;s department). In addition, a number of Royal Artillery sergeants served in the Field Train as Conductors. (The Ordnance Field Train was disbanded following the abolition of the Board of Ordnance, but is now seen as a precursor of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps). The Field Train had its offices in the main guard house and stored its guns, carriages and other equipment in a large building known as the Blue Storehouse (which was near the old Carriage Yard).

====Removal of the military to Woolwich Common====
By the 1770s the number of artillerymen accommodated in the Warren had increased to 900, prompting the construction of a new Royal Artillery Barracks on the north side of Woolwich Common, where they moved in 1777; whereupon their old barracks were converted into terraces of houses (they continued to house artillery officers for some years, and were later used for senior staff of the Royal Laboratory). The Commandant Woolwich Garrison remained quartered in the Arsenal until 1839, when he was provided with a new house on Woolwich Common (Government House).

The Royal Military Repository was destroyed along with New Carriage Square in the fire of 1802, but soon re-established itself just west of the new Artillery Barracks in the area now known as the Repository Grounds (which continue to be used for military training to this day). What survived of the items on display at the Repository came to be housed in the Rotunda there from 1820 (having been kept in the old Academy building in the interim), where they formed the nucleus of a new Royal Artillery Museum.

In place of the old Repository in the Warren, a new Royal Engineers Establishment was built in 1803 (next to, and contemporary with, the new Carriage Factory). It was a sizeable quadrangle of workshops and other facilities, which served as the Royal Engineers&#x27; headquarters until 1856 (when it was converted into a wheel factory for the adjacent Royal Carriage Works). Also in 1803, the Royal Military Artificers were provided with new barracks, outside the Warren (south of Love Lane, halfway between the Warren and the Common); the corps was renamed the Royal Sappers and Miners in 1812. In 1824 the Commanding Royal Engineer, until then resident in the Arsenal, was given a new house in Mill Lane on the edge of the Common. In 1856 the Royal Sappers and Miners merged with the Royal Engineers and the headquarters of the newly unified Corps was moved from Woolwich to Chatham; a small detachment of Engineer officers was retained in Woolwich, however, alongside the house in Mill Lane, where an office building and a works yard were built. The Royal Engineers (after a brief hiatus) retained responsibility for design and construction of the Arsenal&#x27;s buildings and other structures, latterly as part of the Building Works Department, which remained active until the 1950s.

The Ordnance Field Train also left the Warren, in 1804, moving scores of combat-ready field guns and large stocks of ammunition into the newly-built carriage sheds and magazines of what became known as the Grand Depôt (which stretched from the new Artificers&#x27; barracks up towards the new Artillery barracks).
The Royal Military Academy was relocated to the south side of the Common in 1806. The old Academy building, together with the adjacent Storekeeper&#x27;s residence, then became part of the &quot;Royal Laboratory&quot;; so the Storekeeper (who still had seniority within the Arsenal) was given a sizeable new house on what was then the south-east edge of the site (later overtaken by expansion, it came to be named after the nearby Middle Gate, the second of three main gates in the Arsenal&#x27;s perimeter wall). The Cadet Barracks continued to be occupied by the Academy for some time afterwards, initially housing the &#x27;Lower Establishment&#x27; (junior cadets), and later accommodating the Practical Class, formed of senior cadets awaiting commission. From the 1860s the cadet barracks began to be converted for other uses, but they were still occasionally used by the Academy as overflow accommodation until as late as 1882.

===Consolidation of the site===

By 1777 the site had expanded to . The purchase that year of additional land to the east allowed the proof butts to be relocated, realigned and extended in 1779. This in turn freed up additional land on the old Warren site which would be used for a series of substantial building projects in the early 19th century.

In 1777–1778, convict labour was used to construct a (approximately) brick boundary wall, generally high. In 1804 this wall was raised to near the Plumstead road, and to in other parts. (The first boundary wall had been built in 1702, prior to which the Warren had operated on open ground.)
Use of convict labour was key to this period of expansion. It was used to construct a huge new wharf, completed in 1813, and then again in 1814–1816 to dig a canal (the Ordnance Canal), which formed the eastern boundary of the site.

Guardhouses were built at points on the perimeter, manned by troops of the Royal Artillery; one at the main gate (1787–1788) and a pair by the new wharf (1814–1815) are still in place today. The River Thames was key to the Warren and its operations from the earliest days. A dock was built as part of the rebuilt wharf to facilitate loading and unloading from ships (it was supplemented in 1856 by the first in a series of substantial piers). The canal, as well as forming a boundary, provided access for barges; these were initially used to deliver timber to the heart of the carriage-building department and later provided a transit route for guns and explosives.

==19th century: The Arsenal==

In 1805, at the suggestion of King George III, the entire complex became known as the Royal Arsenal; its constituent elements retained their independence, however.

===Expansion during the Napoleonic Wars===
The Napoleonic wars prompted an increase of activity at the Arsenal, which affected all areas of its operation.
In 1803–1805 a substantial Royal Carriage Factory was built (on the site of New Carriage Square, which had been destroyed by fire - possibly arson - the previous year). Its outer walls, complete with a contemporary chiming clock, survive; within, where there are now new apartment blocks, there was once a vast engineering and manufacturing complex staffed by wheelwrights, carpenters, blacksmiths and metalworkers. It was here that steam power first came to be used in the Arsenal, when Joseph Bramah installed his patented planing machine in 1805.

The Arsenal was soon a renowned centre of excellence in mechanical engineering, with notable engineers including Samuel Bentham, Marc Isambard Brunel and Henry Maudslay employed there. Brunel was responsible for erecting the steam sawmills, part of the &quot;Royal Carriage Department&quot;; Maudslay later expanded this buying more steam machinery. The Arsenal also became a noted research facility, developing several key advances in armament design and manufacture. One example was the innovative Congreve Rocket, designed and (from 1805) manufactured on site by William Congreve (son of the Comptroller of the Royal Laboratory). Thenceforward rocket manufacture became a key activity, carried out in purpose-built premises on the eastern edge of the site.
Between 1805 and 1813 the massive Grand Stores complex was constructed alongside new wharves by the river; though celebrated as a landmark of size and dignity befitting the Arsenal, the buildings were immediately, and for many years afterwards, vulnerable to subsidence due to their proximity to the river (this was caused in no small part by on-site supervisors directing the use of cheaper wooden piles in place of the stone foundations specified by the architect, James Wyatt). The buildings formed a three-sided quadrangle of warehouses facing the river, with the central open space used as a shot-yard. (The main range of buildings was flanked by smaller quadrangles to the east and west, only fragments of which survive.) The Grand Store was not uniquely, or even primarily, designed as an artillery store, but rather as warehousing for all kinds of military equipment: an early example of a planned integrated military stores complex.
From 1808, &quot;New Laboratory Square&quot; began to be developed to the north of the original Laboratory complex, with an open-sided quadrangle built around an eighteenth-century Naval storehouse; initially used for storage, it came to be used for manufacturing from the 1850s. (It replaced the &#x27;East Laboratory&#x27;, a quadrangle of buildings which had been demolished to make way for the Grand Store.) Earlier, in 1804, subsidiary Royal Laboratories were set up in the Dockyard towns of Portsmouth and Devonport and in Upnor Castle near Chatham. The Devonport Laboratory (on Mount Wise) had been converted into barracks by 1834 but ten years later Portsmouth&#x27;s (which had been overtaken by dockyard expansion) was relocated to Priddy&#x27;s Hard, where manufacture (initially of small arms ammunition, later of shells and fuzes) continued, overseen from Woolwich.

Proof work continued at this time. In 1803 a burst gun caused damage to nearby buildings, which prompted construction of a new set of proof butts further to the east; these opened (on what would later be the site of the Arsenal&#x27;s gasworks) in 1808. Starting in 1811, a project was begun to raise the ground level of the eastern part of the Arsenal site, as far as the canal, using material dredged from the river bed (a huge undertaking, which took nine years to complete). Also in 1811, a further 20 acres of marshland to the east was purchased, with a view to re-siting the gunnery range (so as to make room for the new sawmills); a 1,250-yard range was then built. In 1838, however, it was accepted that (due to improved ballistics) a much longer range was required; this would require multiple land purchases (at great expense), but was eventually achieved in 1855 when a 3,000-yard range was opened. At the same time, new proof butts were constructed alongside the range.

====Peacetime contraction====
Levels of arms manufacture naturally ebbed during the relatively peaceful years after the Battle of Waterloo; between 1815 and 1835 the size of the workforce shrank from 5,000 to 500 (not including military personnel and convicts). At the same time, the Arsenal fell behind the pace of technological change. In the early 1840s, Scottish engineering pioneer James Nasmyth toured the site and described it as a &#x27;museum of technical antiquity&#x27;. Nasmyth was subsequently engaged to help modernize the complex, but it was only when Britain was on the brink of war that the pace of mechanization increased until, by 1857 (within the space of a decade), the Arsenal had 2,773 specialized machines at work powered by 68 stationary steam engines. A similar pattern of development was seen at the other Board of Ordnance manufacturing sites: the Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield and the Royal Gun Powder Factory, Waltham Abbey.

===Crimean War: mechanisation and innovation===

By 1854, the old Laboratory Square had been roofed over to serve as a vast machine shop at the heart of what was now a munitions factory. The open spaces of the Royal Carriage Works were similarly roofed over and mechanised, and the area of its operations expanded; its carpenters and wheelwrights were moved out into new workshops (which later developed into what is now Gunnery House) east of the main building. (This area had previously been used for the storage and seasoning of the timber used for building the gun carriages.) The building of a new Shot and Shell Foundry, an addition to the Royal Laboratory completed in 1856, enabled manufacture of the latest types of ammunition; this huge complex covered the whole of what is now Wellington Park, and later expanded further to the east.
The Royal Brass Foundry was renamed the Royal Gun Factory in 1855, and its workshops expanded into the Great Pile (Dial Arch) quadrangles. For the first time it diversified into manufacture of iron cannons (which had previously always been commissioned from private contractors); for this it developed a new and much larger foundry complex (on the far side of the Shot and Shell Foundry) which was completed in 1857. The new foundry building, which still stands, was subdivided into three sections (for moulding, casting and trimming) and complemented by a separate forge and boring mill. The early years of its work were defined by famed arms manufacturer William George Armstrong, who in 1859 made his patented designs for rifled ordnance available for government use; (the Arsenal had previously been unable to replicate its effectiveness in-house). He was duly rewarded with a knighthood and the part-time position of Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factory at Woolwich; after further expansion of the factory complex he resigned in 1863 following the demonstration of an even more powerful rifled gun by his rival Sir Joseph Whitworth.
As part of the preparations for the Crimean War (1854–1856), Frederick Abel (later Sir Frederick Abel) had been appointed the first War Department Chemist with the aim of investigating the new chemical explosives which were then being developed. He was mostly responsible for bringing guncotton into safe use and for winning a patent dispute brought by Alfred Nobel against the British Government over the patent rights to cordite which Abel had jointly developed with Professor James Dewar. A new Chemical Laboratory was built to Abel&#x27;s requirements; this was numbered &quot;Building 20&quot;. Abel was also responsible for the technical management of the Royal Gunpowder Factory. He retired from the Royal Arsenal in 1888.
1854 saw the installation of a retort house for what would become the Royal Arsenal&#x27;s Gas Works, which was established close to what was then the north-east corner of the site, just west of the canal. Its superintendent additionally had charge of all hydraulic equipment (lifts, cranes etc.) in use around the Arsenal site (other than that used directly in the process of manufacturing); a pair of hydraulic accumulator towers were built within the eastern outer quadrangle of the Grand Store in 1855 (replacing parts of the building demolished due to subsidence twenty years earlier), which drove machinery throughout the adjacent stores complex.

====Demise of the Ordnance Board====
In the wake of the Crimean War there was widespread criticism of several aspects of Britain&#x27;s military command. The Board of Ordnance, much criticised for inefficiency, was disbanded in 1855, and the War Office then took over responsibility for the Arsenal and all its activities. A Military Stores Department was established, with its headquarters in the Arsenal&#x27;s Grand Store. The manufacturing departments were mostly left to their own devices, though the Ordnance Select Committee (initially set up to assess the merits of the Armstrong Gun) took some responsibility for overseeing ongoing research and development; it and its successors were given Verbruggen&#x27;s House to serve as offices and a board room from 1859. The same period also saw a shift in guard duties and policing on the site – from 1843 these were shared between the Royal Artillery and a detachment from R (Greenwich) Division of the Metropolitan Police, with the Metropolitan Police taking over such duties completely in 1861 with the formation of a devoted No. 1 (Woolwich Arsenal) Division.

===After Crimea===

As had happened earlier in the century, the wartime expansion of the 1850s was followed by spending cuts, and workforce contraction, in the 1860s. Twenty years later, though, the Arsenal began to grow again as investment in weaponry research and manufacture resumed. The narrow-gauge Royal Arsenal Railway was opened in 1873, complemented later by a standard-gauge network connected to the main line. Electricity arrived in the Arsenal in the 1870s; initially used for lighting, it was soon used to power all kinds of machinery. An on-site power station was opened (on the site of the east quadrangle of the Grand Store) in 1896.

====Mechanical and managerial developments====

The Arsenal was still made up of separate divisions. The manufacturing departments (which soon came to be called Ordnance Factories) were each overseen by a (largely independent) Superintendent (who answered directly to the Director of Artillery and Stores): the Royal Laboratory continued to use hundreds of lathes to manufacture ammunition (including bullets, shrapnel shells, fuzes, percussion caps, as well as shot and shells); the Royal Carriage Department continued to build gun carriages, with metal fast replacing wood for this purpose; and the Royal Gun Factory expanded still further, with a new rolling mill and associated boiler house and forge being erected in the early 1870s, and a huge boring-mill ten years later. Tentative moves toward the manufacture of steel guns were made at this time, though these were mainly sourced from outside contractors; it was not till the turn of the century that iron gun manufacture finally ceased in the Arsenal.
Each Factory was responsible for the initial design and final inspection of items, as well as for the intervening manufacturing process. Once completed, all items manufactured on site passed to the Ordnance Store Department, overseen by the Commissary-General of Ordnance (successor to the Storekeepers of old). He had oversight of one of the world&#x27;s largest depots for military equipment (following the closure of Woolwich Dockyard in 1869 its site had been given over to serve the department as a storage depot); he also had a degree of seniority across the Arsenal as a whole, being responsible for receiving orders from the Director of Artillery and Stores and disseminating them across the departments.
The three Ordnance Factories guarded their autonomy and resisted efforts made to place them under a single command (the appointment in 1868 of a Brigadier-General with the title &#x27;Director-General of Ordnance and Commandant of the Royal Arsenal&#x27; was an initiative which lasted only two years). Since ammunition, guns and carriages had to function together, this lack of co-ordination and communication between the departments that manufactured them inevitably caused problems, at a time when the Arsenal was in any case facing criticism for high levels of wasteful expenditure. An 1886 committee of enquiry, under the chairmanship of the Earl of Morley, laid bare these shortcomings and made a number of recommendations, leading among other things to the (civilian) appointment of Sir William Anderson as Director-General of Ordnance Factories (the post was retitled Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories, following Anderson&#x27;s death, in 1899). A key recommendation was for clear managerial separation between the manufacturing departments and those responsible for inspection and approval of their products, which resulted in the establishment of a separate Inspection department under a Chief Inspector of Armaments.
In 1887 the Proof Butts were relocated once again (for the last time) further to the east. Four bays were built, to which a further four were added in 1895. Each bay consisted of a concrete box (25 ft wide by 20 ft high and 70 ft deep, two-thirds filled with sand) open towards the gun position, which was around 500 yards away. (The design was much as it had been in previous centuries, except in concrete rather than wood.) Guns were brought into position using a gantry crane, and various instruments measured velocity and other variables. Further bays, with railway mountings for the guns, would be added during the First World War, by which time the area and its operation was known as the Proof and Experimental Establishment.

Recognising the increasing divergence of naval gun design from that of land artillery, part of the Ordnance Store Department was separated off in 1891 to form an independent Naval Ordnance Store Department, which (from its headquarters in the Arsenal) had oversight of what were soon termed Royal Naval Ordnance Depôts (later RN Armament Depots), including RNAD Woolwich: an extensive storage facility within the Arsenal itself.

====Social and sporting activities====

In 1868 twenty workers at the Arsenal formed a food-buying association operating from a house in Plumstead and named it the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society. Over the next 115 years the enterprise grew to half a million members across London and beyond, providing services including funerals, housing, libraries and insurance.

In 1886 workers at the Arsenal formed a football club initially known as &quot;Dial Square&quot; after the workshops in the heart of the complex, playing their first game on 11 December (a 6–0 victory over Eastern Wanderers) in the Isle of Dogs. Renamed &quot;Royal Arsenal&quot; two weeks later (and also known as the &#x27;Woolwich Reds&#x27;), the club entered the professional football league as &quot;Woolwich Arsenal&quot; in 1893 and later became known as Arsenal F.C., having moved to north London in 1913. Royal Ordnance Factories F.C. were another successful team set up by the Royal Arsenal but only lasted until 1896.

==20th century: The Royal Ordnance Factories==

Further enlargement was to follow, and on an unprecedented scale; by the 20th century, though, there was little room for further development on site, so the Arsenal had to expand its area eastwards outside its brick boundary wall onto the Plumstead Marshes. The eastern portion of the Arsenal site had long been used for the more dangerous manufacturing processes, as well as for proof testing. This pattern continued, with the Composition Establishment (where assembly of cartridges, fuzes and other items took place) being moved east of the canal and a lyddite factory being established by the river. Later, much of the area of Plumstead and Erith Marshes was scattered with storage magazines for explosive materials, each in its own walled, moated and earth-traversed enclosure. Manufacture of Whitehead torpedoes, begun in the Arsenal in 1871 (with the canal used as a testing run for a time) was moved to Greenock in 1911.
Scientific research played an increasing role across the Arsenal from the early years of the 20th century: in 1902 an Experimental Establishment was set up to carry out research and investigations into explosives; (co-located with the Proof Butts, the two operations later combined to form the Proof and Experimental Establishment). At the same the staff of the War Department Chemist was expanded to strengthen its research capability; and over the next few years other small research departments emerged, focused on areas such as metallurgy, materials and mechanical technology. In 1907 these were all grouped together under a Superintendent of Research to form the Research Department.

===First World War===

At its peak, during the First World War, the Royal Arsenal extended over some and employed around 80,000 people. The Royal Arsenal by then comprised the Royal Gun &amp; Carriage Factory (which had amalgamated under Colonel Capel Lofft Holden in 1907), the Royal Laboratory (which in 1922 split to form the Royal Ammunition Factory and the Royal Filling Factory) and separate Naval Ordnance and Army Ordnance Store Departments. Other divisions included the Research and Development Department and various Inspection departments set up in the wake of the Morley Report (including that of the Chief Chemical Inspector, Woolwich, successor to the War Department Chemist). The expansion was such that in 1915 the Government built an estate of 1,298 homes - later (1925) known as the Progress Estate - at Eltham to help accommodate the workforce.

In addition to the massive expansion of the Royal Ordnance Factories in the Arsenal, and of private munitions companies, other UK Government-owned National Explosives Factories and National Filling Factories were built during the First World War. All the National Factories closed at the end of the War, with only the Royal (munitions) Factories (at Woolwich, Enfield, and Waltham Abbey) remaining open through to the Second World War. 

===Inter-war years===
During the quiet period after the end of the First World War, the Royal Arsenal built steam railway locomotives. It had an extensive standard gauge internal railway system, and this was connected to the North Kent Line just beyond Plumstead railway station. The Royal Arsenal also cast the Memorial Plaques given to the next-of-kin of deceased servicemen and servicewomen. In 1919 a committee was set up, under the chairmanship of Thomas McKinnon Wood, to report on the future organisation and role of the Royal Arsenal. One recommendation was for the establishment of an integrated Armament Design Office (up until then each factory had maintained its own, largely independent, drawing office). In 1921 a new Design Department duly came into being; based in the Central Offices building, it was a joint service body, responsible for initiating designs for guns, carriages, ammunition, small arms, tanks and transport vehicles, in close collaboration with the ordnance factories. 

On 1 January 1927 policing of the site was transferred from the Metropolitan Police to the new War Department Constabulary. The latter was renamed the Army Department Constabulary in 1964 and then merged into the Ministry of Defence Police in 1971, with these two bodies continuing to police the site until its closure. In 1935, the Ballistics branch of the Research Department began work on developing rockets for use as anti-aircraft weapons. To provide a more remote testing location, Fort Halstead in Kent was acquired by the War Office in 1937, initially serving as an outstation of the Arsenal. This went on to become the Projectile Development Establishment (it later relocated to Aberporth in Wales for the duration of the war).

The build-up to the Second World War started in the late 1930s. Abel&#x27;s old Chemical Laboratory was by now too small and new Chemical Laboratories were built in 1937 on &quot;Frog Island&quot;, on a former loop in the Ordnance Canal. Staff from the Royal Arsenal helped design, and in some cases managed the construction of, many of the new Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs) and the ROF Filling Factories. Much of the Royal Arsenal&#x27;s former ordnance production was moved to these new sites, as it was considered vulnerable to aerial bombing from mainland Europe. The original plan was to replace the Royal Arsenal&#x27;s Filling Factory with one at ROF Chorley and another at ROF Bridgend, but it was soon realised that many more ROFs would be needed. Just over forty had been established by the end of the war, nearly half of them Filling Factories, together with a similar number of explosives factories built and run by private companies, such as ICI″s Nobels Explosives, but these private sector factories were not called ROFs.

===Second World War===
The Royal Arsenal was caught up in the Blitz on 7 September 1940. After several attacks, the fuze factory was destroyed and the filling factory and a light gun factory badly damaged. Explosive filling work ceased on the site, but the production of guns, shells, cartridge cases and bombs continued. In September 1940, prior to the raid, some 32,500 people worked there; but after the raid this dropped to 19,000. The numbers employed on site had increased by February 1943, with 23,000 employed, but by August 1945 were down to 15,000. 103 people were killed and 770 injured, during 25 raids, by bombs, V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets.

The Central Offices were also damaged in the raid, prompting the removal of the Design Department from Woolwich; by 1942 both it and the Research Department were accommodated at Fort Halstead (they remained there after the war, and would later merge to become the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE)).

The staff of the Chemical Inspectorate, working with explosives, were evacuated in early September 1940. Shortly afterwards one of the Frog Island buildings was destroyed by bombing and another damaged. The laboratories were partially re-occupied in 1945 and fully re-occupied by 1949.

===The final run-down===

During the quiet period after the end of the Second World War, the Royal Arsenal built railway wagons, between 1945 and 1949, and constructed knitting frames for the silk stockings industry, up to 1952. Armament production then increased during the Korean War.

From 1947, the British atomic weapons programme, called &quot;HER&quot; or &quot;High Explosive Research&quot;, was based at Fort Halstead in Kent (ARDE), and also at Woolwich. The first British atomic device was tested in 1952; Operation Hurricane. In 1951 the AWRE moved to RAF Aldermaston in Berkshire. ARDE, which had its origin in the Research and Design Departments of the Arsenal, retained its Woolwich outstation there until the 1980s.

In 1953, a body called Royal Arsenal Estate was set up to dispose of areas of land deemed surplus to requirements. An approximately area of the site, around what is now &quot;Griffin Manor Way&quot;, was used for an industrial estate; the Ford Motor Company becoming its first tenant in 1955. Two of the roads on this estate &quot;Nathan Way&quot; and &quot;Kellner Road&quot; appear to have links with people connected with the Royal Arsenal: a Col. Nathan, at the Royal Gunpowder Factory; and, W. Kellner being the second War Office Chemist.

In 1957 a merger took place which created ROF Woolwich: thus, for the first time, the various manufacturing operations on the site were united into a single Royal Ordnance Factory. Its area of operation was henceforward restricted to the western part of the Arsenal site, with everything to the east being earmarked for eventual disposal. In this guise, the factory continued to operate (with upgraded facilities) for a further ten years. The Proof and Experimental Establishment closed in 1957, though RARDE continued to make use of the proof butts until September 1969.

The Woolwich Royal Ordnance Factories closed in 1967, and at the same time a large part of the eastern end of the site was sold to the Greater London Council. Much of it was used to build the new town of Thamesmead. Parts of the older (western) section of the site were leased as storage or office space to assorted public bodies (including HM Customs and Excise, the British Museum Library, the National Maritime Museum, the Property Services Agency); alongside these tenants, a variety of smaller MOD departments were accommodated, some on a temporary but others on a longer-term basis.
Shortly after the closure of the Woolwich Royal Ordnance Factories, the &quot;Frog Island&quot; chemical laboratories were moved into a new building erected in 1971, in what was to become the Royal Arsenal East. The old &quot;Frog Island&quot; area was then sold off and a relocated Plumstead Bus Garage was built on part of this site. This action separated what remained of the Royal Arsenal, some , into two sites: Royal Arsenal West, at Woolwich; and, Royal Arsenal East, at Plumstead, approached via &quot;Griffin Manor Way&quot;. It also led to breaking down of parts of the 1804 brick boundary wall. Part of it near Plumstead Bus station was replaced by iron railings and chain link fencing; later the public roadway (now the A206) was also changed at the Woolwich market area and the Royal Arsenal&#x27;s boundary was moved inwards so that the Beresford Gate (which had served as the main entrance to the Arsenal since 1829) became separated from the site by the A206. Its mid-1980s replacement, north of the rerouted A206, stands not far from where the original (1720s) main gateway once stood; it is graced by a pair of 18th-century gatepiers and urns saved from The Paragon on the New Kent Road (itself demolished for road-widening in the 1960s).
The Royal Arsenal site retained its links to ordnance production for almost another thirty years as a number of the Ministry of Defence Procurement Executive&#x27;s Quality Assurance Directorates had their headquarters offices located there. These included the Materials Quality Assurance Directorate (MQAD), which looked after materiel, including explosives and pyrotechnics; and the Quality Assurance Directorate (Ordnance) (QAD (Ord)), which looked after ordnance for the Army. MQAD was the successor of the old &quot;War Department Chemist&quot; and the &quot;Chemical Inspectorate&quot;; QAD(Ord) was the successor of the Chief Inspector of Armaments department. There was a separate Naval Ordnance Inspection Department (based in Middlegate House from 1922) that looked after the Royal Navy&#x27;s interests. QAD (Ord) was based at Royal Arsenal West together with a Ministry of Defence Publications section and part of the British Library&#x27;s secure storage accommodation. MQAD was based, until closure of the site at Royal Arsenal East; and all the buildings on this site were given &quot;E&quot; numbers, such as &quot;E135&quot;. Belmarsh high-security prison was built on part of Royal Arsenal East, becoming operational in 1991.

The Royal Arsenal ceased to be a military establishment in 1994.

==Present day==

The sprawling Arsenal site is now one of the focal points for redevelopment in the Thames Gateway zone. Parts of the Royal Arsenal have been used to build residential and commercial buildings.

Some links to its historic past have been kept, with many notable buildings in the historic original (West) site being retained in the redevelopment. Attempts to put the history of the site into context were, however, short-lived: Firepower - The Royal Artillery Museum (direct successor of the Arsenal&#x27;s Repository museum), which had presented the history of artillery alongside that of the regiment, closed in 2016; and Greenwich Heritage Centre, which told the story of Woolwich including the Royal Arsenal, closed in 2018.

===Residential developments===

The western part of the Royal Arsenal has now been transformed into a mixed-use development by Berkeley Homes. It comprises one of the biggest concentrations of Grade I and Grade II listed buildings converted for residential use, with more than 3,000 residents. One of the earliest developments was Royal Artillery Quays, a series of glass towers rising along the riverside built by Barratt Homes in 2003. The first phase of homes at Royal Arsenal, &quot;The Armouries&quot;, consisted of 455 new-build apartments in a six-storey building. This was followed by &quot;The Warehouse, No.1 Street&quot;. The development has a residents&#x27; gym, a Thames Clippers stop on site, a Streetcar car club and a 24-hour concierge facility for residents. Wellington Park provides open space and a public house, the Dial Arch, opened in June 2010

Plans have now been submitted for a new masterplan encompassing further land along the river. More than 1,700 homes already exist at Royal Arsenal Riverside, with an additional 3,700 new homes planned, along with of commercial, retail, leisure space and a 120-bedroom hotel by Holiday-Inn Express. The plans also include Woolwich Crossrail station, opened in 2022, which was part-funded by Berkeley Homes.
=== Cultural district ===
In October 2018, planning permission was granted for the first phase of a multi-million pound restoration of historic buildings near the new Woolwich Crossrail station, to create a 15,000sqm complex of theatres, dance studios and places to eat. Originally this development was known as &#x27;Woolwich Creative District&#x27; but names of the district and buildings were later put to the public vote and in July 2019 the name &#x27;Woolwich Works&#x27; was announced

===Historic architecture===

Several early 18th-century buildings on the site have been attributed to the architects Sir John Vanbrugh or Nicholas Hawksmoor (both of whom are known to have designed buildings for the Board of Ordnance), including the Royal Brass Foundry, Dial Arch and the Royal Military Academy; but whilst acknowledging their influence (direct or indirect), the Survey of London credits Brigadier-General Michael Richards (Surveyor-general for the Ordnance board at the time) as having played the leading part in their design. In the late-18th and early-19th centuries James Wyatt, as Architect of the Ordnance, was responsible for several buildings on the site, including the Main Guardhouse (1787), the Grand Store (1805) and Middlegate House (1807). More often than not, though, it was the on-site Engineers and Clerks of the Works who were responsible for the design of buildings and other structures within the working Arsenal.

<doc id="398865" wikidata="Q562294" url="?curid=398865" title="The Boondocks (comic strip)">
<text>The Boondocks was a daily syndicated comic strip written and originally drawn by Aaron McGruder that ran from 1996 to 2006. Created by McGruder in 1996 for Hitlist.com, an early online music website, it was printed in the monthly hip hop magazine &quot;The Source&quot; in 1997. As it gained popularity, the comic strip was picked up by the Universal Press Syndicate and made its national debut on April 19, 1999. A popular and controversial strip, &quot;The Boondocks&quot; satirizes African-American culture and American politics as seen through the eyes of young African American radical Huey Freeman. McGruder&#x27;s syndicate said it was among the biggest launches the company ever had.

== Publication history ==

The strip debuted on Hitlist.com on February 8, 1996. It later appeared in the University of Maryland newspaper &quot;The Diamondback&quot; under editor-in-chief Jayson Blair on December 3, 1996, paying McGruder $30 per strip—$17 more than other cartoonists. McGruder ended the strip&#x27;s run in &quot;The Diamondback&quot; on March 18, 1997, two weeks after the strip was omitted due to a technical error and a &quot;Diamondback&quot; staffer printed the word &quot;OOPS&quot; in its place without an explanation. He pulled the strip after the paper refused to run an apology. (Upon the revelation in 2004 of news article fabrications by Blair, by then a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, McGruder&#x27;s comic strip joined others in lampooning Blair.)

The strip was rejected by six syndicates — including the Washington Post Writers Group, Creators Syndicate, United Media, and Chronicle Features — before finally being picked up. Many of the syndicates that rejected the strip were supportive but felt that &quot;The Boondocks&quot; was &quot;too edgy.&quot; An article from the summer of 1997 asserted that Universal Press Syndicate (UPS) was taking a &quot;hard look&quot; at the strip; UPS eventually picked it for syndication in April 1999.

In Fall 2003, Boston, Massachusetts-based artist Jennifer Seng assumed art duties from McGruder. In an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, McGruder said, &quot;If something had to give, it was going to be the art. I think I&#x27;m a better writer than artist.&quot; Carl Jones succeeded Seng as illustrator in late 2004. In the introduction to the collection &quot;Public Enemy #2&quot;, McGruder wrote, &quot;I had hired an artist to help me on some of the art duties. People think I stopped drawing the strip, but that&#x27;s never been the case. To this day there has never been a single &quot;Boondocks&quot; strip that I did not personally touch—I still obsess over the details of Huey, Riley, Caesar and Granddad. I still go over every panel. I still care what it looks like, and I always will.&quot;

On February 28, 2006, McGruder announced that his strip would go on a six-month hiatus, starting March 27, 2006, with new installments resuming in October. Repeats of earlier strips were offered by Universal Press Syndicate in the interim. &quot;The Boondocks&quot; was syndicated to over 300 clients at its peak, but more than half substituted different features rather than publish reruns during the hiatus. On September 25, 2006, Universal Press Syndicate president Lee Salem announced that the comic would not return, saying, &quot;Although Aaron McGruder has made no statement about retiring or resuming &quot;The Boondocks&quot; for print newspapers ... newspapers should not count on it coming back in the foreseeable future.&quot; He added that Universal would welcome McGruder back if he chose to return. Greg Melvin, McGruder&#x27;s editor at the syndicate, met with him in an unsuccessful attempt to talk the cartoonist into returning. McGruder cited his work on the show among other projects as reasons for not then returning to the strip. After the strip was canceled, reruns continued to be carried by some newspapers through November 26, 2006. Reruns of the strip are available online at GoComics.

In February 2019, a series of one-shot strips were published on radio personality Charlamagne tha God&#x27;s Instagram page.

== Description ==

The strip depicts Huey Freeman and his younger brother Riley, two young children who have been moved out of the West Side of Chicago with their grandfather Robert to live with him in the predominantly white fictional suburb of Woodcrest (in Maryland, as seen from the area code stated in the March 16, 2000 strip). This relates to McGruder&#x27;s childhood move from Chicago to Columbia, a diverse Maryland suburb. The title word &quot;boondocks&quot; alludes to the isolation from primarily African-American urban life that the characters feel, and permits McGruder some philosophical distance.

Huey is a politically perceptive devotee of black radical ideas of the past few decades (as explained in the May 4, 1999 strip, Huey is in fact named after Black Panther Huey P. Newton, who was named for Huey Long) and is harshly critical of many aspects of modern black culture. Riley, on the other hand, is enamored of gangsta rap culture and the &quot;thug&quot;/bling-bling lifestyle. Their grandfather Robert is a firm disciplinarian, World War II veteran, and former civil rights activist who is offended by both their values and ideas.

Huey&#x27;s best friend is Michael Caesar, a dreadlocked aspiring MC who agrees with many of Huey&#x27;s criticisms but serves as a positive counterpoint to Huey&#x27;s typically pessimistic attitude by taking a humorous approach to issues. He is also a budding comedian, although most of his humor consists of trying to play &quot;yo momma&quot; jokes on Huey, which always fall flat. The Freemans&#x27; neighbors are NAACP member and assistant DA Thomas DuBois (a reference both to Uncle Tom and W. E. B. Du Bois) and his white wife Sarah, also a lawyer. Their young daughter Jazmine is very insecure about her ethnic identity and is often the subject of Huey&#x27;s antipathy for being out of touch with her African ancestry.

&quot;The Boondocks&quot; was very political and occasionally subject to great controversy, usually sparked by the comments and behavior of its main character, Huey. The comic strip has been withheld by newspapers several times. In particular, the principal characters often discussed racial and American socio-economic class issues. Because of its controversy and serious subject matter, many newspaper publishers either moved the strip to the op-ed section of the paper, pulled more potentially controversial strips from being published, didn&#x27;t publish the strip at all, or canceled it altogether.

== Main characters ==
* Huey Freeman – A cynical boy who appears angry most of the time, with strident political awareness, and who sees himself as a revolutionary. Named after Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panthers, he is disturbed by the ignorance in modern-day American society and media. An observant, intelligent child, he often finds himself playing the voice of reason. Huey is fond of some conspiracy theories, and completely distrusts all authorities.
* Riley Freeman – The opposite of his older brother, Riley praises the &quot;thug life,&quot; and admires and emulates the rappers and thugs he sees on television. He has assigned himself the nickname &quot;Esco&quot;, a reference to the rapper Nas christening himself &quot;Nas Escobar&quot; in the mid-1990s after infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar. He also formerly had the nickname &quot;Young Reezy&quot;, but that appears to have faded away with time. Other aliases he has given himself have included &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot; (chosen many months before 9/11) and Uday. Riley chose this last nickname on one of the extremely rare occasions he watched the news; he normally goes to great lengths to avoid the acquisition of knowledge. He once became upset after getting a C+ in school because he was afraid such &quot;exemplary&quot; grades would ruin his &quot;street cred&quot;. Since asking for and not receiving rims for Christmas, Riley has been determined to sleigh-jack Santa Claus on Christmas Eve for the dual purpose of taking what he believes is owed to him and meting out punishment. In 2005, Riley&#x27;s hair became progressively larger due to his lack of haircut; when it turned into an Afro he was able to trick people into thinking he was Huey until Grandad made him get cornrows.
* Michael Caesar – Huey&#x27;s classmate and best friend who&#x27;s known simply by his last name Caesar, who agrees with most of Huey&#x27;s views of life. Unlike Huey, Caesar is more optimistic and cheerful, and usually jokes about whatever issue is at hand. It was Caesar&#x27;s idea to find a boyfriend for Condoleezza Rice, reasoning that if she came to truly love somebody living on the planet she wouldn&#x27;t be so &quot;hell bent to destroy it.&quot; Caesar is originally from Brooklyn and needs little prompting to vocally represent his home town. He and Huey have co-founded the newsletter the &quot;Free Huey World Report&quot; and the annual &quot;Most Embarrassing Black People Awards.&quot;
* Robert Jebediah &quot;Granddad&quot; Freeman – Huey and Riley&#x27;s retired grandfather, a and disciplinarian who usually sees through the shenanigans of his grandsons. Robert is known to panic at news reports, and values his own peace and comfort over the needs of others while still looking out for the children&#x27;s welfare.
* Thomas and Sarah Dubois – An interracial couple in the neighborhood. They both work as lawyers. Tom is often seen talking (sometimes arguing) with Huey about current politics, while Huey tends to deride Tom for being a conformist yuppie, sometimes going so far as to sarcastically suggest that he is not really black. For a while Tom was kicked out of the house by Sarah after he called her a &quot;two-timing political floozy&quot; when she voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore. Four years later, Tom kidnapped Nader in hopes of preventing him from taking votes away from John Kerry and costing the Democrats the 2004 Presidential Election. Huey eventually persuaded him to release Nader.
* Jazmine Dubois – Thomas and Sara&#x27;s biracial daughter, who seems to like Huey, despite his general coldness toward her. She is notable for her insecurity over her biracial status. Jazmine is often portrayed as naïve, and is optimistic in contrast to Huey&#x27;s pessimism. Early in the strip she was deliberately ambiguously colored so as to cloud the issue of whether she was white or black. It even prompted her to be directly asked by her teacher. She disappeared for roughly two years, and it was revealed she had been so frightened of terrorists that she would not leave her house. She tried to turn herself in to the FBI three times, because she thought she was helping the terrorists by being scared (having heard statements to the effect that &quot;If you live in fear, the terrorists win&quot;). She eventually came out because of a &quot;Credible threat against her teddy bear.&quot; Jazmine is insecure about her curly and voluminous hair, wishing it looked straighter, like her mother&#x27;s hair. Huey&#x27;s suggestion to Tom that he and Sara try &quot;emphasizing the natural beauty of her African features&quot; rather than trying to help her change her appearance fell on deaf ears. On one occasion when Jazmine was complaining about her &quot;big and poofy&quot; hair, Huey interrupted her to ask what she thought of clouds. She thought clouds were pretty, but completely missed the point Huey was trying to make.
* Uncle Ruckus – an elderly, overweight black man who is notably racist and self-loathing. He is the darkest skinned character of the cast. He first appears in December 2004 as a replacement mall Santa Claus after Riley took out the first one with a flying folding chair. He appeared again in his first Sunday feature in September 2005 as Huey and Riley&#x27;s bus driver and he also admitted to working as a janitor at the school. He and Robert are sometimes seen playing checkers together between and after the aforementioned appearances.
* Cindy McPhearson – A white girl in Huey&#x27;s class who appears to be utterly clueless about racial issues. She shows a fondness and curiosity for rap music, particularly Snoop Dogg.

== Minor characters ==
* Hiro Otomo – One of Huey&#x27;s friends, a young Japanese-American DJ. Hiro only appeared in the original &quot;Diamondback&quot; version of the strip. 
* Principal Williams – The principal of J. Edgar Hoover Elementary. An out-of-touch white man who prepared for the arrival of Huey and Riley by renting several blaxploitation films, mistakenly thinking of them as representative of black culture. He somehow has access to FBI files of Huey.
* John Petto – Huey, Cindy, and Caesar&#x27;s white teacher, who is as clueless about how to handle them as the principal is. Old-fashioned and not used to black people, he is intimidated by Huey&#x27;s intellect and has struggled trying to debate with Huey during class.
* Mrs. Peterson – Riley&#x27;s teacher, who has a strict rule of giving her students no special treatment, where they must pull their weight or fail. Because of this, she once failed a girl from Romania, who was a math genius, but could barely read or write. Before she started teaching, she was originally a nun, then she worked in three maximum-security prisons. Mrs. Peterson has little patience for Riley and his street behavior.
* Flagee and Ribbon
* Psycho Star Wars Guy

== Controversies ==
The content of McGruder&#x27;s comic strip often came under fire for being politically left-wing and occasionally risqué, leading to its being published in the op-ed section of many newspapers. For example, a strip making fun of BET&#x27;s rap videos (some of which rely on the sexually suggestive gyrations of female dancers) and a strip mocking Whitney Houston&#x27;s drug problems and emphasizing her buttocks, were pulled out of circulation. &quot;The Boondocks&quot; garnered significant attention after the September 11th attacks with a series of strips in which Huey calls a government tipline to report Ronald Reagan for funding terrorism. Soon after, he &quot;censored&quot; several strips by featuring a talking patriotic yellow ribbon and a flag (named Ribbon and Flagee, respectively) instead of the usual cast.

Several strips have been briefly pulled from prominent publications. For example, the &quot;Condi Needs a Man&quot; strip, in which Huey and his friend Caesar create a personal ad for U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, portraying her as a &quot;female Darth Vader type that seeks loving mate to torture&quot;, resulted in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; withholding a week&#x27;s worth of strips, the longest such suspension ever by the paper. However, the paper&#x27;s ombudsman, Michael Getler, later sided with McGruder. The &quot;Post&quot; also declined to run &quot;Can a Nigga Get a Job?&quot;, which had black contestants compete on a reality TV show to work for Russell Simmons, only to find that all the contestants were rude and lazy.

McGruder has often attacked Black conservative commentator Larry Elder in the comic strip as well as the television series. In response, Elder published an opinion piece in which he created the &quot;McGruder&quot;, an award for statements made by black public figures that Elder considers &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;vulgar&quot;, and/or &quot;offensive&quot;.

<doc id="398866" wikidata="Q459501" url="?curid=398866" title="Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington">
<text>Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington (née Power; 1 September 1789 – 4 June 1849), was an Irish novelist, journalist, and literary hostess. She became acquainted with Lord Byron in Genoa and wrote a book about her conversations with him.

==Early life==
Born Margaret Power, near Clonmel in County Tipperary, Ireland, she was a daughter of Edmund Power and Ellen Sheehy, small landowners. She was &quot;haphazardly educated by her own reading and by her mother&#x27;s friend Ann Dwyer.&quot; Her childhood was blighted by her father&#x27;s character and poverty, and her early womanhood was made wretched by a compulsory marriage at the age of fifteen to Captain Maurice St. Leger Farmer, a military officer whose drunken habits finally brought him as a debtor to the King&#x27;s Bench Prison, where he died by falling out of a window in October 1817. She had left him after three months.

Marguerite later moved to Hampshire to live for five years with the family of Captain Thomas Jenkins of the 11th Light Dragoons, a sympathetic and literary army officer. Jenkins introduced her to Charles Gardiner, 1st Earl of Blessington, a widower with four children (two legitimate), seven years her senior. They married at St Mary&#x27;s, Bryanston Square, Marylebone, on 16 February 1818, only four months after her first husband&#x27;s death.

==Grand tour==
Of rare beauty, charm and wit, she was no less distinguished for her generosity and for the extravagant tastes she shared with her second husband. On 25 August 1822 they set out for a continental tour with Marguerite&#x27;s youngest sister, the 21-year-old Mary Anne, and servants. On the way they met Count D&#x27;Orsay (who had first become an intimate of Lady Blessington in London in 1821) in Avignon on 20 November 1822, before settling at Genoa for four months from 31 March 1823. There they met Byron on several occasions, giving Lady Blessington material for her &quot;Conversations with Lord Byron&quot;.

After that they settled for the most part in Naples, where she met the Irish writer Richard Robert Madden, who was to become her biographer. They also spent time in Florence with their friend Walter Savage Landor, author of &quot;Imaginary Conversations,&quot; which she greatly admired.

==London salon==
It was in Italy, on 1 December 1827, that Count D&#x27;Orsay married Harriet Gardiner, Lord Blessington&#x27;s only daughter by his former wife. The Blessingtons and the newly-wed couple moved to Paris towards the end of 1828, taking up residence in the Hôtel Maréchal Ney, where the Earl suddenly died at 46 of an apoplectic stroke in 1829. D&#x27;Orsay and Harriet then accompanied Lady Blessington to England, but the couple separated soon afterwards amidst much acrimony. D&#x27;Orsay continued to live with Marguerite until her death. Their home, first at Seamore Place, now named Curzon Square, and afterwards Gore House, Kensington, now the site of the Royal Albert Hall, became a centre of attraction for all that was distinguished in literature, learning, art, science and fashion. Benjamin Disraeli wrote &quot;Venetia&quot; whilst staying there, and it was at her home that Hans Christian Andersen first met Charles Dickens.

After her husband&#x27;s death she supplemented her diminished income by contributing to various periodicals as well as by writing novels. She was for some years editor of &quot;The Book of Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Keepsake&quot;, popular annuals of the day. In 1834 she published her &quot;Conversations with Lord Byron&quot;. Her &quot;Idler in Italy&quot; (1839–1840), and &quot;Idler in France&quot; (1841) were popular for their personal gossip and anecdotes, descriptions of nature and sentiment. Blessington became a gossip columnist for Dickens&#x27; &quot;Daily News&quot;.

Early in 1849, Count D&#x27;Orsay left Gore House to escape his creditors; subsequently the furniture and decorations were sold in a public sale successfully discharging Lady Blessington&#x27;s debts. Lady Blessington joined the Count in Paris. They stayed at a hotel, and then moved to a residence close to Duke de Guiche (Count D&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s nephew from his sister Duchess de Garmont), where they would also dined &quot;en famille&quot;.

=== Death ===
She died on 4 June 1849. The autopsy took place the next day, when it was discovered that enlargement of the heart to nearly double the natural size, which enlargement must have been progressing for a period of at least twenty-five years, though incipient disease of the stomach and liver had complicated the symptoms. 

She was buried in the monument made by Count D&#x27;Orsay, to which he would also be buried.

==Literary tributes==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration &quot;To Marguerite, Countess of Blessington&quot; to a portrait by Alfred Edward Chalon was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839.

<text>Aaron Vincent McGruder (born May 29, 1974) is an American writer, cartoonist, and producer best known for creating &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, a Universal Press Syndicate comic strip and its animated TV series adaptation.

==Early life and education==
Aaron McGruder was born in Chicago, Illinois. When Aaron was six years old, his family moved to Columbia, Maryland, after his father accepted a job with the National Transportation Safety Board. McGruder has an older brother.

McGruder attended the Jesuit school Loyola Blakefield from grades seven to nine. After two years he left the school and transferred to the public Oakland Mills High School. At the University of Maryland, he graduated with a degree in African American Studies.

==Career==
===&quot;The Boondocks&quot; and related work===
&quot;The Boondocks&quot; began in 1996 as a webcomic on Hitlist.com, one of the first online music websites. At the time, he was a DJ on &quot;The Soul Controllers Mix Show&quot; on WMUC. &quot;The Boondocks&quot; briefly appeared as a comic strip in the University of Maryland&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Diamondback&quot;, during Jayson Blair&#x27;s tenure as editor-in-chief. McGruder signed a deal with the Universal Press Syndicate and in April 1999, the strip began appearing in 160 newspapers.

The comic strip&#x27;s main characters are two young African-American brothers, Huey, named after Huey P. Newton, and his younger brother and wannabe gangsta, Riley, from inner-city Chicago, who are relocated to live with their grandfather in a sedate suburb. In six months, the comic strip was being distributed to more than 200 publications. Five collections of &quot;The Boondocks&quot; have been published: &quot;All The Rage&quot;, &quot;Public Enemy #2&quot;, &quot;A Right To Be Hostile&quot;, &quot;Fresh for &#x27;01: You Suckaz&quot;, and &quot;Boondocks: Because I Know You Don&#x27;t Read The Newspaper&quot;. An animated television series adaptation of the strip was successful on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim.

In 2013, McGruder expressed interest in filming a movie featuring &quot;The Boondocks&quot; TV series supporting character Uncle Ruckus. Gary Anthony Williams would reprise his role. McGruder set a goal of $200,000 for startup donations at uncleruckusmovie.com between January 30 to March 1, 2013, but the campaign ended with 2,667 backers and $129,963.

In March 2014, &quot;The Boondocks&quot; was revived for a new season, but without McGruder&#x27;s involvement as its showrunner. The first episode of the fourth season was first broadcast on April 21, 2014. In 2019, it was announced that a fifth season of &quot;The Boondocks&quot; would be produced with McGruder&#x27;s involvement. The project was cancelled in February 2022. 

===Other work===
Among his other projects have been the &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; variety comedy series &quot;The Super Rumble Mix Show&quot;. McGruder also developed &quot;Black Jesus&quot;, another comedy series broadcast on Adult Swim, part of Cartoon Network.

McGruder has developed into a public speaker on political and cultural issues. McGruder said in a 2002 keynote address at the July 12–14, 2002 H2K2 conference that he believed that President George W. Bush was involved with the September 11 attacks:

During a 2003 reception hosted by &quot;The Nation&quot;, McGruder offended attendees by defiantly expressing his support for Ralph Nader&#x27;s 2000 presidential bid. McGruder endured heckling and walkouts as he defended his commitment to left-wing causes, including, he claimed, calling Condoleezza Rice a &quot;mass-murderer&quot; to her face during the 2002 NAACP Image Awards. In 2009, Richmond, Indiana newspaper &quot;Palladium-Item&quot; reported that McGruder told a Martin Luther King Day audience at local Earlham College that then-President-elect Barack Obama was &quot;not black&quot;. McGruder released a statement insisting he was misquoted, while maintaining he remained &quot;cautiously pessimistic&quot; about Obama&#x27;s presidency.

In 2004, with Reginald Hudlin, McGruder co-authored a graphic novel, &quot;Birth of a Nation: A Comic Novel&quot;, about African Americans in East St. Louis during an election. The book&#x27;s illustrations were drawn by cartoonist Kyle Baker.

In 2005, in celebration of Black History Month, McGruder was invited to provide a lecture at the Miami University of Ohio.

In 2010, McGruder worked as screenwriter in the final treatment of the feature film &quot;Red Tails&quot;, released in early 2012. Its story is based on the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African American combat pilots during World War II.

In August 2017, it was announced that McGruder, along with producer Will Packer, would develop a series for Amazon Video called &quot;Black America&quot;, set in an alternative history wherein emancipated black Americans receive three Southern states as reparations for slavery and form an independent nation. The series&#x27; announcement was seen by some commentators as a response to HBO&#x27;s then in-development alternative history series &quot;Confederate&quot;, whose plot entails a history wherein the Confederacy won the Civil War; that series was ultimately never developed, with its cancellation confirmed in January 2020. Packer denied the project was a response to &quot;Confederate&quot; and was already in development when that series was announced. , Amazon has released no further updates regarding &quot;Black America&quot; and its current status is unknown.

==Personal life==
By 2005 and , McGruder was residing in Los Angeles.

<text>Alfred Guillaume Gabriel Grimod d&#x27;Orsay, comte d&#x27;Orsay (4 September 18014 August 1852) was a French amateur artist, dandy, and man of fashion in the early- to mid-19th century.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris, the second son of Albert Gaspard Grimaud, Comte d&#x27;Orsay, a Bonapartist general. His mother was Baroness Eleonore von Franquemont, an illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Württemberg and the Italian adventuress Anne Franchi. His elder brother died in infancy.

In 1821, he entered the French army of the restored Bourbon monarchy (against his own Bonapartist tendencies), attending the lavish coronation of George IV of the United Kingdom in London that year (staying until 1822) and serving as a Garde du Corps of Louis XVIII. While in London he formed an acquaintance with Charles Gardiner, 1st Earl of Blessington and Marguerite, Countess of Blessington, which quickly ripened into intimacy. Scholars have speculated both that the Countess and d&#x27;Orsay had an affair, and that the infatuation was purely between the Earl and d&#x27;Orsay. While contemporaries remarked on the young man&#x27;s effeminacy, the evidence for either relationship is inconclusive.

The following year the couple visited d&#x27;Orsay at Valence on the Rhone, and at the invitation of the earl he accompanied the party on their tour through Italy.

In the spring of 1823, he met Lord Byron at Genoa, and the published correspondence of the poet at this period contains numerous references to d&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s gifts and accomplishments, and to his peculiar relationship to the 1st Earl of Blessington and Countess of Blessington. A diary which d&#x27;Orsay had kept during his visit to London in 1821–1822 was submitted to Byron&#x27;s inspection, and was much praised by him for the knowledge of men and manners and the keen faculty of observation it displayed.

He previously met Lord and Lady Blessington in 1822 and was romantically interested in Lady Blessington. Perhaps to divert D’Orsay&#x27;s attention from his wife, Lord Blessington wrote a will leaving his Irish property to one of his daughters, should either marry Count D’Orsay. He eventually chose to marry Lady Harriet Gardiner with the promise of the estate.

On 1 December 1827, Count d&#x27;Orsay married Lady Harriet Gardiner, a girl of fifteen, the daughter of Lord Blessington by his previous wife. The union, if it rendered his connection with the Blessington family less ostensibly equivocal than before, was in other respects an unhappy one, and a legal separation took place in 1838, at which Lady Harriet paid over £100,000 to his creditors (though even this did not cover all his debts) in exchange for d&#x27;Orsay giving up all claims to the Blessington estate.

After the death of Lord Blessington, which occurred in 1829, the widowed countess returned to England, accompanied by d&#x27;Orsay, and her home, first at Seamore Place, then at Gore House, soon became a resort of the fashionable literary and artistic society of London, which found an equal attraction in host and in hostess. The count&#x27;s charming manner, brilliant wit, and artistic faculty were accompanied by benevolent moral qualities, which endeared him to all his associates. His skill as a painter and sculptor was shown in numerous portraits and statuettes representing his friends, which were marked by great vigour and truthfulness, if wanting in the finish that can only be reached by persistent discipline.

It was at Gore House that d&#x27;Orsay met Benjamin Disraeli and Edward Bulwer-Lytton, themselves young men of fashion who dabbled in the arts. D&#x27;Orsay and Disraeli were good friends in the 1830s–to the point that Disraeli asked d&#x27;Orsay to be his second, when it appeared that Disraeli would fight a duel with Morgan O&#x27;Connell, the son of Irish agitator Daniel O&#x27;Connell. D&#x27;Orsay declined, on the grounds of being a foreigner, and Disraeli went with Henry Baillie, a mutual friend. The character of Count Alcibiades de Mirabel in Disraeli&#x27;s novel &quot;Henrietta Temple&quot; was modeled on d&#x27;Orsay, to whom the book was dedicated.
Count d&#x27;Orsay had been from his youth a zealous Bonapartist, and one of the most frequent guests at Gore House was Prince Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1849 the count went bankrupt, and the establishment at Gore House being broken up, he went to Paris. Lady Blessington sold almost all her possessions and followed him there, but died a few weeks after her arrival, leaving him heartbroken. He endeavoured to provide for himself by painting portraits. He was deep in the counsels of the prince-president (who had also returned to Paris from exile, and been elected president the year before d&#x27;Orsay arrived), but relations between them were less cordial after Louis-Napoléon&#x27;s 1851 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; (the French Parliament is dissolved), of which the count had expressed his strong disapproval.

Reluctant to entrust d&#x27;Orsay with any affairs of state, prince-president Louis-Napoleon finally offered him the position of &quot;surintendant&quot; of the Beaux-Arts School. Within a few months of the appointment, however, d&#x27;Orsay contracted a spinal infection, of which he died on 4 August 1852 in the house of his sister Ida, duchesse de Gramont, at Chambourcy, just a few days after his appointment had been officially announced. He had designed a pyramidal grey stone tomb for Lady Blessington at Chambourcy, and he too was buried in it, with the not yet Emperor Napoleon III among the mourners at the funeral.

<text>The ERCO Ercoupe is an American low-wing monoplane aircraft that was first flown in 1937. It was originally manufactured by the Engineering and Research Corporation (ERCO) shortly before World War II; several other manufacturers continued its production after the war. The final model, the Mooney M-10, first flew in 1968 and the last model year was 1970. It was designed to be the safest fixed-wing aircraft that aerospace engineering could provide at the time, and the type continues to enjoy a faithful following.

==Design and development==
===Fred Weick===
In 1931, aeronautical engineer Fred Weick was assistant chief of the aeronautics division of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). In 1934, he asked permission to build an aircraft based on the 1931 Stout Skycar using fabric instead of aluminum covering and control modifications based on NACA research. Weick and a group of co-workers designed and assembled the experimental aircraft in their spare time and paid for it themselves. The resulting aircraft, known as the W-1, featured tricycle landing gear, a parasol wing, and a pusher propeller configuration.

Fred Weick listed the W-1 design goals that were tested in later seminars:
*Tricycle landing gear with castering nosewheel, steerable if desired
*Suitable longitudinal and lateral stability with limited up-elevator deflection, to prevent loss of control due to stalling and spinning.
*A glide-control flap
*Two-control operation using controls for pitch and roll.

In 1934, the Bureau of Air Commerce approached Weick&#x27;s team looking for standards for a competition for a safe and practical $700 aircraft. In 1936, the winner of the competition was the Stearman-Hammond Y-1, incorporating many of the safety features of the W-1. Two other winners were the Waterman Aeroplane and a roadable autogyro, the Autogiro Company of America AC-35. The W-1 was not intended for production to qualify as a competitor but was purchased by the Bureau for continued experimental tests in spin-control safety. After the prototype W-1 underwent a forced landing, an updated W-1A was built by Fairchild, incorporating leading edge cuffs.

===ERCO===
Weick left NACA in 1936 and joined Engineering and Research Corporation&#x27;s (ERCO) fledgling aircraft team as chief designer, primarily to continue improving his aircraft design. Focusing his efforts on a number of design issues, primarily simplicity and safety, Weick strove to create a reasonably priced aircraft that would not stall or spin. Retaining the tricycle gear for ease of maneuvering on the ground, and limited stall-spin features, Weick switched to a low-wing monoplane configuration in his new model, powered by an engine in tractor configuration.

The ERCO 310, which included a fully cowled engine, made its first flight in October 1937 at the College Park Airport and was soon renamed the &quot;Ercoupe&quot;. The easy-to-fly design featured unique design features, including a large glazed canopy - with almost as much visibility as a bubble canopy - for improved visibility. The prototype 310 featured an ERCO-made inverted four-cylinder engine, the ERCO I-L 116, which was quickly dropped due to its high manufacturing cost compared to the new four-cylinder Continental A-65 air-cooled boxer engine. Lacking rudder pedals, the Ercoupe was flown using only the control wheel. A two-control system linked the rudder and aileron systems, which controlled yaw and roll, with the steerable nosewheel. The control wheel controlled the pitch and the steering of the aircraft, both on the ground and in the air, simplifying control and coordinated turning and eliminating the need for rudder pedals. A completely new category of pilot&#x27;s license was created by the CAA for Ercoupe pilots who had never used a rudder pedal.

The Ercoupe was the first aircraft certified by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) as &quot;characteristically incapable of spinning.&quot; The high-winged General Skyfarer obtained the second certification by licensing the ERCO technology. The first production Ercoupe, serial no. 1, NC15692 built in 1939 was donated to the National Air and Space Museum. In 1941 that aircraft, designated YO-55, was used in US Army Air Force testing.

The two-seat ERCO Ercoupe 415 went on sale in 1940. &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine described the aircraft as &quot;nearly foolproof&quot; and showed pictures of a pilot landing with his hands in the air. Only 112 aircraft were delivered before World War II intervened, halting all civil aircraft production. By the middle of 1941, aluminum supplies were being diverted to war-related production, so ERCO decided to manufacture Ercoupes for military use by using wood as the principal building material. The substitution of wood resulted in a heavier but quieter aircraft, because the wood absorbed vibrations from the engine and airflow. Ercoupes were flown during the war by the Civilian Pilot Training Program for flight instruction, and the Civil Air Patrol used them to patrol for German submarines.

===Postwar sales===
Although World War II had interrupted production of the Ercoupe, general aviation manufacturers were enthusiastic about the prospects of a postwar aviation boom. Thousands of men and women were trained as pilots by the government, and the hope was that they would want to include flying in their civilian life. Production of the model 415-C resumed in 1945, and in 1946 alone 4,311 aircraft were produced and sold at a cost of US$2,665. This was the same price as in 1941. At its peak, ERCO was turning out 34 Ercoupes per day on three daily production shifts. The aircraft was aggressively marketed through unconventional outlets such as the men&#x27;s department of the Macy&#x27;s department store chain.
However, private aircraft sales slumped after the war and the bottom dropped out of the civil aircraft market in late 1946, ending prospects for a boom market for civil aircraft sales. A 30-day layoff at the ERCO factory in November resulted in rivets tossed around the factory and some aircraft sides and signs being painted. The year ended with an Ercoupe flown by a test pilot and mechanic breaking up in flight.

===Other production===
;Aeronca
Aeronca obtained a licence to produce the Ercoupe 415 as the Aeronca 12AC Chum in 1946 and built two prototypes: &quot;NX39637&quot;, with the Ercoupe twin-tail, and &quot;NX83772&quot; with a larger single tail, metal wings, and trailing-link struts in the main undercarriage. The Chum was powered by a Continental C-85J with a cruise speed. No production ensued.

;Sanders Aviation
In 1947, ERCO sold its remaining Ercoupe inventory to Sanders Aviation, which continued to produce the aircraft in the same ERCO-owned factory. A total of 213 aircraft were sold by 1950. During this time, Wieck, ERCO&#x27;s chief engineer, moved on to Texas A&amp;M, where he developed the agricultural Piper Pawnee aircraft and eventually the popular Piper Cherokee with John Thorp and Karl Bergey.

;Univair Aircraft Industries
Univair Aircraft Corporation of Aurora, Colorado purchased the Ercoupe design from the Engineering and Research Company in 1950. It provided spare parts and customer support to the existing aircraft.

;Forney/Fornaire Aircoupe
In April 1955, Univair sold the Ercoupe type certificate to the Forney Aircraft Company of Fort Collins, Colorado, which later became the Fornaire Aircraft Company. The aircraft produced differed from the 415-G in its engine/propeller combination; new aircraft were upgraded to a C-90 engine and had revised engine cowling, larger baggage compartment, and aluminum-covered wing panels. The F-1A model had three axis controls and bucket seats. Production began in 1958 and ended in 1959.

*56 of the F-1 Forney Deluxe were produced in 1958 and sold for $6,995 each.
*59 of the F-1 Forney Explorer, Execta and Expediter were produced in 1959 and sold for $6,995.
*23 of the F-1A Forney Trainer were produced in 1959. It was sold for $7,450.

A total of 138 aircraft were produced.

;Air Products Company Aircoupe
Between August 1960 and March 1964, the rights to the Aircoupe aircraft were held by the AirCoupe division of Air Products Company of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The company was started by the city, with the hope of establishing aircraft manufacture as a local industry. AirCoupe purchased the type certificate from Forney when a potential deal with Beechcraft fell through. Only a few airframes were produced before the type certificate was sold to Alon, Incorporated on March 16, 1964. 25 of the F-1A Forney Trainer were produced for US$7,450 each.

;Alon Aircoupe
Alon Inc. was founded by John Allen and Lee O. Higdon, two executives who had retired from aircraft manufacturer Beechcraft to found their own company. They had previously negotiated with Forney Aircraft to purchase production of the Aircoupe so that Beechcraft could use the design as an introductory trainer. The deal was canceled by Olive Ann Beech, who decided to concentrate resources on the Beechcraft Musketeer. This decision caused the executives to leave Beechcraft and establish Alon in McPherson, Kansas, which purchased the type certificate for the Aircoupe from the City of Carlsbad, New Mexico on March 16, 1964.
&quot;A new company formed by former Beechcraft executives Allen and Higdon, who have purchased all assets, jigs, tools, and engineering of the program from the city of Carlsbad NM. They expect to deliver the first of 30-50 Aircoupes to be built next year for about $8,000.&quot;


The Alon A-2 and A-2A Aircoupes featured a sliding canopy, a Continental C90 engine, separate bucket seats, and an improved instrument panel. The A-2 also differed from earlier two-control models in having limited-movement rudder pedals. This was done in order to make it a more acceptable training aircraft and to make it easier to counteract increased P-factor yaw during a climb from the more powerful engine. Nosewheel steering was no longer interlinked with the control yoke, and was changed to the more common practice of being interlinked with the rudder pedals (this was the same system that was installed in the Forney F-1A). The older two axes control system was offered as an option. The single control (non-differential) wheel brakes remained. The airplane had a higher rate of climb, a higher speed for best climb rate, and better engine cooling. Its non-spinning characteristics remained unchanged.

Alon produced 245 A-2s from 1964 to 1967, with peak production of 137 in 1966. The last 25 A-2s produced by Alon had spring-steel landing gear in place of the original main gear struts, light alloy castings and trailing links. The base price in 1967 was up to $7975. Production of the A-2 ceased in September 1967, and on October 9, 1967, Alon was purchased by, and became a division of, the Mooney Airplane Company of Kerrville, Texas.
;Mooney A-2A and M10 Cadet

Mooney began producing the aircraft in 1968 as the Mooney A-2A. Next, the company redesigned the fuselage from the cockpit back, with square windows behind the sliding canopy. Even as it produced the A-2A Cadet, Mooney was busy re-designing the aircraft. On February 23, 1968, the first Mooney M10 Cadet flew. The aircraft has a single fin, with a vertical leading edge, as most Mooneys do.

;Univair
The type certificate was sold to Univair Aircraft Corporation of Aurora, Colorado in October 1974 and remains with Univair. The company has not produced any new aircraft but continues to produce replacement parts and provide technical assistance to Ercoupe owners.

==Operational history==

===Military===
Three model 415-C aircraft were procured by the United States Army Air Forces for use during World War II.

On 12 August 1941, the first USAAF rocket-assist takeoff was made by a Wright Field test pilot, Capt. Homer Boushey, using a small civilian-type Ercoupe aircraft. Subsequent refinements of this technique were made for assisting heavily loaded aircraft in taking off from limited space.

An additional Ercoupe was evaluated by the Royal Air Force in 1947. This aircraft was serial number 4784, carried Royal Air Force markings VX 147, and was polished metal with RAF roundels.

===Light sport use===
The Ercoupe is a type certified aircraft. However, some Univair Ercoupe 415-C and 415-CD models meet the FAA requirements to be flown by sport pilots as light-sport aircraft. The characteristics of the Ercoupe helped Jessica Cox (who was born without arms) to become a qualified pilot.

==Variants==

=== ERCO/Sanders ===
;310
:1937 prototype originally powered by a Continental A40 engine and with tricycle landing gear, metal construction, fabric-covered wings, and a single tail fin. The engine was later swapped with a ERCO IL-116.

;415
:Initial production aircraft powered by ERCO IL-116 engines. The -A and -B suffixes were never used; the company&#x27;s official records use only the -C suffix, which stood for &quot;Continental&quot;, once the IL-116 was no longer used. 10 aircraft were built from 1939 to 1940.

;Wooden Ercoupe
:Two aircraft were built using birch and plywood in 1941 to demonstrate use of non-strategic materials, but no further aircraft were built and the test articles were scrapped.

;415-C Ercoupe
:First variant to enter large-scale production. Prewar 415-C Ercoupes were powered by Continental A65-8 engines, while postwar Ercoupes were powered by Continental C75-12 engines. Maximum gross weight was . 4,520 total built; 112 pre-war and 4,408 post-war.

;415-D Ercoupe
:As 415-C but with fuel capacity increased by and a modified up-elevator limit. Gross weight was also increased to . 77 built. One 415-D was modified under a Supplemental Type Certificate to fit a Lycoming O-235-C2C powerplant.

Flown by Grady Thrasher and his brother, who rolled, looped, and spun it. The aircraft had a smoke system for each engine, and could be flown from either cockpit.

=== Forney/Air Products ===

;F-1 Aircoupe
:Forney/Fornaire-built development of the ERCO 415-G. Powered by a Continental C90-12F engine, the F-1 differed from the 415-G in that it had a metal-clad outer wing, an improved canopy, a redesigned canopy, as well as a new instrument panel and seats. 115 built.

;F-1A Aircoupe
:As F-1 but with modified control runs as well as a bew rear spar and nosewheel leg. 50 built by Air Products Co.

=== Alon ===

;A-2 Aircoupe
:Alon-built derivative of the F-1A powered by a Continental C90-16F. Other differences included a sliding canopy as well as improved fuel tanks and instruments. 244 built.

;A-2A Aircoupe
:As A-2 but with spring steel main landing gear. 64 built.

;Bryan Autoplane
:Leland D. Bryan built a series of roadable aircraft using an Ercoupe fuselage, calling this line the Bryan Autoplane. Significant modifications included a double-articulated folding wing mechanism and a pusher engine. It still retained Ercoupe features, such as the twin tail and the center section. The first flight was in 1953, and the model II flew 65 hours. The Model III with a single wing-fold mechanism crashed in 1974, killing Bryan.

;Lasher Little Thumper
:C. W. Lasher built and flew a single-seat open-cockpit taildragger aircraft called &quot;Little Thumper&quot;, using an Ercoupe center section and wing assembly and an Aeronca Champ aft fuselage.

<text>In mathematics, the theory of fiber bundles with a structure group formula_1 (a topological group) allows an operation of creating an associated bundle, in which the typical fiber of a bundle changes from formula_2 to formula_3, which are both topological spaces with a group action of formula_1. For a fiber bundle formula_5 with structure group formula_1, the transition functions of the fiber (i.e., the cocycle) in an overlap of two coordinate systems formula_7 and formula_8 are given as a formula_1-valued function formula_10 on formula_11. One may then construct a fiber bundle formula_12 as a new fiber bundle having the same transition functions, but possibly a different fiber.

==An example==

A simple case comes with the Möbius strip, for which formula_1 is the cyclic group of order 2, formula_14. We can take as formula_5 any of: the real number line formula_16, the interval formula_17, the real number line less the point 0, or the two-point set formula_18. The action of formula_1 on these (the non-identity element acting as formula_20 in each case) is comparable, in an intuitive sense. We could say that more formally in terms of gluing two rectangles formula_21 and formula_22 together: what we really need is the data to identify formula_17 to itself directly &quot;at one end&quot;, and with the twist over &quot;at the other end&quot;. This data can be written down as a patching function, with values in formula_1. The associated bundle construction is just the observation that this data does just as well for formula_18 as for formula_17.

==Construction==
In general it is enough to explain the transition from a bundle with fiber formula_5, on which formula_1 acts, to the associated principal bundle (namely the bundle where the fiber is formula_1, considered to act by translation on itself). For then we can go from formula_2 to formula_3, via the principal bundle. Details in terms of data for an open covering are given as a case of descent.

This section is organized as follows. We first introduce the general procedure for producing an associated bundle, with specified fibre, from a given fibre bundle. This then specializes to the case when the specified fibre is a principal homogeneous space for the left action of the group on itself, yielding the associated principal bundle. If, in addition, a right action is given on the fibre of the principal bundle, we describe how to construct any associated bundle by means of a fibre product construction.

===Associated bundles in general===
Let formula_32 be a fiber bundle over a topological space formula_33 with structure group formula_1 and typical fibre formula_5. By definition, there is a left action of formula_1 (as a transformation group) on the fibre formula_5. Suppose furthermore that this action is effective.
There is a local trivialization of the bundle formula_38 consisting of an open cover formula_39 of formula_33, and a collection of fibre mapsformula_41such that the transition maps are given by elements of formula_1. More precisely, there are continuous functions formula_43 such thatformula_44 

Now let formula_12 be a specified topological space, equipped with a continuous left action of formula_1. Then the bundle associated with formula_38 with fibre formula_12 is a bundle formula_49 with a local trivialization subordinate to the cover formula_39 whose transition functions are given byformula_51where the formula_1-valued functions formula_53 are the same as those obtained from the local trivialization of the original bundle formula_38. 
This definition clearly respects the cocycle condition on the transition functions, since in each case they are given by the same system of formula_1-valued functions. (Using another local trivialization, and passing to a common refinement if necessary, the formula_56 transform via the same coboundary.) Hence, by the fiber bundle construction theorem, this produces a fibre bundle formula_49 with fibre formula_12 as claimed.

===Principal bundle associated with a fibre bundle===
As before, suppose that formula_38 is a fibre bundle with structure group formula_1. In the special case when formula_1 has a free and transitive left action on formula_12, so that formula_12 is a principal homogeneous space for the left action of formula_1 on itself, then the associated bundle formula_49 is called the principal formula_1-bundle associated with the fibre bundle formula_38. If, moreover, the new fibre formula_12 is identified with formula_1 (so that formula_12 inherits a right action of formula_1 as well as a left action), then the right action of formula_1 on formula_12 induces a right action of formula_1 on formula_49. With this choice of identification, formula_49 becomes a principal bundle in the usual sense. Note that, although there is no canonical way to specify a right action on a principal homogeneous space for formula_1, any two such actions will yield principal bundles which have the same underlying fibre bundle with structure group formula_1 (since this comes from the left action of formula_1), and isomorphic as formula_1-spaces in the sense that there is a formula_1-equivariant isomorphism of bundles relating the two.

In this way, a principal formula_1-bundle equipped with a right action is often thought of as part of the data specifying a fibre bundle with structure group formula_1, since to a fibre bundle one may construct the principal bundle via the associated bundle construction. One may then, as in the next section, go the other way around and derive any fibre bundle by using a fibre product.

===Fiber bundle associated with a principal bundle===

Let formula_84 be a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle and let formula_85 be a continuous left action of formula_1 on a space formula_5 (in the smooth category, we should have a smooth action on a smooth manifold). Without loss of generality, we can take this action to be effective.

Define a right action of formula_1 on formula_89 via
:formula_90
We then identify by this action to obtain the space formula_91. Denote the equivalence class of formula_92 by formula_93. Note that
:formula_94
Define a projection map formula_95 by formula_96. Note that this is well-defined.

Then formula_95 is a fiber bundle with fiber formula_5 and structure group formula_1. The transition functions are given by formula_100 where formula_101 are the transition functions of the principal bundle formula_102.

This construction can also be seen categorically.
More precisely, there are two continuous maps formula_103, given by acting with formula_1 on the right on formula_102 and on the left on formula_5.
The associated vector bundle formula_107 is then the coequalizer of these maps.

==Reduction of the structure group==
The companion concept to associated bundles is the reduction of the structure group of a formula_1-bundle formula_109. We ask whether there is an formula_110-bundle formula_111, such that the associated formula_1-bundle is formula_109, up to isomorphism. More concretely, this asks whether the transition data for formula_109 can consistently be written with values in formula_110. In other words, we ask to identify the image of the associated bundle mapping (which is actually a functor).

===Examples of reduction===

Examples for vector bundles include: the introduction of a &quot;metric&quot; resulting in reduction of the structure group from a general linear group formula_116 to an orthogonal group formula_117; and the existence of complex structure on a real bundle resulting in reduction of the structure group from real general linear group formula_118 to complex general linear group formula_119.

Another important case is finding a decomposition of a vector bundle formula_120 of rank formula_121 as a Whitney sum (direct sum) of sub-bundles of rank formula_122 and formula_123, resulting in reduction of the structure group from formula_124 to formula_125.

One can also express the condition for a foliation to be defined as a reduction of the tangent bundle to a block matrix subgroup - but here the reduction is only a necessary condition, there being an &quot;integrability condition&quot; so that the Frobenius theorem applies.

<doc id="398878" wikidata="Q669992" url="?curid=398878" title="Rincewind">
<text>Rincewind ( ) is a fictional character who appears in several of the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels by Terry Pratchett. He was a failed student at Unseen University for wizards in Ankh-Morpork, often described as &quot;the magical equivalent to the number zero&quot;. He spent most of his time running away from people who wanted to kill him for various reasons. The reason that he was still alive and running was explained by noting that while he was born with a wizard&#x27;s spirit, he had the body of a long-distance sprinter. 

Rincewind was portrayed by David Jason in the film adaptation of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;. Pratchett said in an interview that he unwittingly took Rincewind&#x27;s name from &quot;Churm Rincewind&quot;, a fictitious person referred to in early &quot;&#x27;Beachcomber&quot; columns in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

==Appearances==


===In books===
In &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, Rincewind acted as a guide for the tourist Twoflower, who hailed from the Agatean Empire in the Counterweight Continent, across the disc from the &#x27;hub&#x27; continent where Ankh-Morpork is situated. He was recruited for this because only he can communicate with Twoflower (they use Be-Trobi as a lingua franca), Twoflower agreed to pay him in rhinu (large gold coins), and because the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork wished to prevent an Agatean attack on Ankh-Morpork sparked by Twoflower&#x27;s death. He and Twoflower wandered around for quite a while, and were chased by everything from the personification of Death to a Lovecraftian creature named Bel-Shamharoth.

Rincewind and Twoflower parted ways at the end of &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot; and Twoflower gave Rincewind his sapient-pearwood Luggage. Rincewind&#x27;s adventures continued, and he was chased across various regions of the Discworld in spite of, or often driven by, his desire to find somewhere he can relish boredom in peace and quiet.

During the events of &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, in which the Discworld risks being destroyed if Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde succeed in their plan to &quot;return fire to the Gods with interest&quot;, Rincewind said that he did not wish to volunteer for a dangerous mission. When asked to explain, he said he merely refused for appearances, because someone was bound to nominate him because of his knowledge of the geography of Cori Celesti or his friendship with Cohen, so even &quot;if&quot; he refused, somehow events would conspire against him and he would end up going on the mission &quot;anyway&quot; as he attempted to escape.

&quot;Raising Steam&quot; mentions Rincewind in footnotes, which refer to him as a professor at the university, studying the effects of different flowers on the nervous system.

===In other media===
Rincewind is the main character of the text adventure &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, based on the book of the same name.

Rincewind is also the player character of the 1995 &quot;Discworld video game&quot;. After a dragon is spotted in Ankh-Morpork, Unseen University&#x27;s archchancellor sends Rincewind to find the source of the trouble. In the sequel, &quot;Discworld II: Missing Presumed...!?&quot;, Death disappears and the archchancellor puts Rincewind in charge of finding him and convincing him to get back to work. In both games, Rincewind is voiced by Eric Idle.

==Character==
Rincewind has the ability to pick up the essentials of foreign languages quickly and fluency only slightly less quickly, and appears to have the ability to blend in to any situation. During &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, when he was projected into a universe that may or may not have been our own, he assumed the role of a nuclear physicist. In keeping with his nature, the role was as a physicist who specialized in the &#x27;breakaway oxidation phenomena&#x27; of certain reactors—or, to put another way, what happens when those reactors caught fire (Terry Pratchett served as the press officer for several nuclear power plants before he became a full-time writer). Rincewind speculated on the nature of science, expressing hope in &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; that there was something &quot;better than magic&quot; in the world, and speculated on the possibility of harnessing lightning, for which he was mocked by &quot;sensible&quot; Discworld citizens. Rincewind is also fairly streetwise. He is often depicted as a harsh critic of the selected stupidities surrounding him, even though he can&#x27;t help but comply with whatever absurdity that arises. For example, in the computer games starring him, he consistently spotted the ludicrous events around him and would then make jokes and puns to the unaware participants. He also seems to display, despite his apparent failure as a wizard, a fairly extensive magical knowledge, recognizing various spells, magical artefacts and concepts throughout his escapades.

Some of Rincewind&#x27;s talents once stemmed from a semi-sentient and highly destructive spell that had lodged itself inside his mind and scared off all other spells (mentioned in &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;; though even without the spell&#x27;s interference he was still an extremely incompetent wizard). The spell occasionally tried to make itself heard when Rincewind was going through a stressful time; as he was falling to his near-death, he said the first seven out of eight words of the spell.

In &quot;Sourcery&quot; and &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot; Rincewind claims that he never knew his mother as she ran away before he was born.
Rincewind has received several titles during his stay at the Unseen University; some of them because nobody else wants them, others to keep him busy doing work unrelated to magic. These titles and their accompanying tenure include the condition that he cannot have any salary, influence, or opinions. They do, however, include meals, his laundry done, and (as a result of all the impressive-sounding but essentially meaningless titles that have been bestowed upon him) up to eight buckets of coal a day during the entire year.

==Concept and creation==
Pratchett said that Rincewind&#x27;s job is &quot;to meet more interesting people&quot;, saying that there is not much he can do with a character who&#x27;s a coward and doesn&#x27;t care who knows it. Pratchett noted that one of his major problems was that he has a &quot;lack of an inner monologue&quot;.

==The Luggage==
The Luggage is a large chest that follows Rincewind literally &quot;wherever&quot; he goes—even onto Roundworld, which Rincewind initially only visited virtually. It is made of sapient pearwood, a magical, intelligent plant that is nearly extinct, impervious to magic, and only grows in a few places outside the Agatean Empire, generally on sites of very old magic. As such, whilst considered oddities on the Hubland continent, such chests were commonplace in the Agatean Empire. It can produce hundreds of little legs and move very fast if the need arises. It has been described as &quot;half suitcase, half homicidal maniac&quot;. &quot;Interesting Times&quot; demonstrated that Luggages were capable of reproducing, which Twoflower suggested was chiefly the result of what the Luggage learnt in Ankh-Morpork.

Its function is to act as both a luggage carrier and bodyguard for its owner. The Luggage is fiercely defensive of its owner, and is generally homicidal in nature, killing or eating several people and monsters and destroying various ships, walls, doors, geographic features, and other obstacles throughout the series. Its mouth contains &quot;lots of big square teeth, white as sycamore, and a pulsating tongue, red as mahogany&quot;. The inside area of The Luggage does not appear to be constrained by its external dimensions, and contains many conveniences: even after it has just devoured a monster, the next time it opens the owner will find his underwear, neatly pressed and smelling slightly of lavender. It is unknown exactly what happens to anyone it &#x27;eats&#x27;.

One of the most notable features of The Luggage is its ability to follow its current owner anywhere, including places like inside its owner&#x27;s mind, off the edge of the Disc, Death&#x27;s Domain, inside the Octavo, the Dungeon Dimensions, and even (literally) to Hell and back. Like all luggage, it is constantly getting lost and having to track its owner down. It has only one way of overcoming obstacles, and that is to simply ignore them and smash a hole through them—including a wall to a magic shop that had since relocated to another city by magical means.

==Reception and legacy==
In her review of &quot;Night Watch&quot;, A. S. Byatt noted the lack of recent appearances of Rincewind and the grimmer presentation of the Witches and Ankh-Morpork as signs of Pratchett&#x27;s imagination getting darker.

While the current release (version 3.0.0) of VLC media player is named Vetinari, a previous release (version 2.1.0) was named Rincewind. Other releases of VLC media player have been named &quot;The Luggage&quot; (version 1.1.0), and release 2.0.0 was named &quot;Twoflower&quot;, the character that gave The Luggage to Rincewind (in &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;).

Rincewind and Discworld witch Nanny Ogg appeared on first-class Royal Mail stamps in March 2011. The issue included wizards, witches and enchanters from British fiction, and also included characters from the Arthurian Legend, from J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, and from the &quot;Narnia&quot; series of C. S. Lewis.

Paul Whitelaw, writing for &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, felt that David Jason was &quot;clearly several decades too old&quot; to be Rincewind in the film adaptation of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;.

The Cretaceous gymnosperm species &quot;Phoenicopsis rincewindii&quot; is named after Rincewind.

<text>In music, a canon is a contrapuntal (counterpoint-based) compositional technique that employs a melody with one or more imitations of the melody played after a given duration (e.g., quarter rest, one measure, etc.). The initial melody is called the leader (or &quot;dux&quot;), while the imitative melody, which is played in a different voice, is called the follower (or &quot;comes&quot;). The follower must imitate the leader, either as an exact replication of its rhythms and intervals or some transformation thereof. Repeating canons in which all voices are musically identical are called rounds—familiar singalong versions of &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&quot; and &quot;Frère Jacques&quot; that call for each successive group of voices to begin the same song a bar or two after the previous group began are popular examples.
An accompanied canon is a canon accompanied by one or more additional independent parts that do not imitate the melody.
==History==
===Medieval and Renaissance===
During the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Baroque—that is, through the early 18th century—any kind of imitative musical counterpoints were called fugues, with the strict imitation now known as canon qualified as &quot;fuga ligata&quot;, meaning &quot;fettered fugue&quot;. Only in the 16th century did the word &quot;canon&quot; begin to be used to describe the strict, imitative texture created by such a procedure. The word is derived from the Greek &quot;κανών&quot;, Latinised as &quot;canon&quot;, which means &quot;law&quot; or &quot;norm&quot;. In contrapuntal usage, the word refers to the &quot;rule&quot; explaining the number of parts, places of entry, transposition, and so on, according to which one or more additional parts may be derived from a single written melodic line. This rule was usually given verbally, but could also be supplemented by special signs in the score, sometimes themselves called &quot;canoni&quot;. The earliest known non-religious canons are English rounds, a form first given the name &quot;rondellus&quot; by Walter Odington at the beginning of the 14th century; the best known is &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot; (composed around 1250), called a &quot;rota&quot; (&quot;wheel&quot;) in the manuscript source. The term &quot;round&quot; was first used in English sources in the 16th century.

Canons featured in the music of the Italian Trecento and the 14th-century ars nova in France. An Italian example is &quot;Tosto che l&#x27;alba&quot; by Gherardello da Firenze. In both France and Italy, canons were often featured in hunting songs. The medieval and modern Italian word for hunting is &quot;caccia&quot;, while the medieval French word is spelled &quot;chace&quot; (modern spelling: &quot;chasse&quot;). A well-known French chace is the anonymous &quot;Se je chant mains&quot;. Richard Taruskin describes &quot;Se je chant mains&quot; as evoking the atmosphere of a falcon hunt: &quot;The middle section is truly a tour de force, but of a wholly new and off-beat type: a riot of hockets set to &#x27;words&#x27; mixing French, bird-language, and hound-language in an onomatopoetical mélange.&quot; Guillaume de Machaut also used the 3-voice &quot;chace&quot; form in movements from his masterpiece &quot;Le Lai de la Fontaine&quot; (1361). Referring to the setting of the fourth stanza of this work, Taruskin says &quot;a well-wrought chace can be far more than the sum of its parts; and this particular chace is possibly Machaut&#x27;s greatest feat of &quot;subtilitas&quot;.&quot;

An example of late 14th century canon which featured some of the rhythmic complexity of the late 14th century &quot;ars subtilior&quot; school of composers is &quot;La harpe de melodie&quot; by Jacob de Senleches. According to Richard Hoppin, &quot;This virelai has two canonic voices over a free and textless tenor.&quot;

In many pieces in three contrapuntal parts, only two of the voices are in canon, while the remaining voice is a free melodic line. In Dufay&#x27;s song &quot;Resvelons nous, amoureux&quot;, the lower two voices are in canon, but the upper part is what David Fallows describes as a &quot;florid top line&quot;:

===Baroque===
Both J. S. Bach and Handel featured canons in their works. The final variation of Handel&#x27;s keyboard Chaconne in G major (HWV 442) is a canon in which the player&#x27;s right hand is imitated at the distance of one beat, creating rhythmic ambiguity within the prevailing triple time:

===Classical===
An example of a classical strict canon is the Minuet of Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet in D Minor, Op. 76, No. 2. &quot;Throughout its sinewy length, between upper and lower strings. Here is the superbly logical fulfilment of the two-part octave doubling of Haydn&#x27;s earliest divertimento minuets&quot;:

===Beethoven===
Beethoven&#x27;s works feature a number of passages in canon. The following comes from his Symphony No. 4:

Antony Hopkins describes the above as &quot;a delightfully naïve canon&quot;. More sophisticated and varied in its treatment of intervals and harmonic implications is the canonic passage from the second movement of his Piano Sonata 28 in A major, Op. 101:

Beethoven&#x27;s most spectacular and dramatically effective use of canon occurs in the first act of his opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;. Here, four of the characters sing a quartet in canon, &quot;a sublime musical wonder&quot;, accompanied by orchestration of the utmost delicacy and refinement. &quot;Each of the four participants delivers his or her quatrain&quot;, &quot;The use of canon to embody the differing perspectives of the participants a first glance seems odd, but the rigid form allows for some character differentiation and does in fact make a dramatic point&quot;. &quot;Everyone sings the same music to very different words, sinking their private thoughts into musical or at least linear anonymity&quot;. &quot;The softly padding gait, the dove-tailed perfection of the counterpoint, induce a trance that, carrying the protagonists outside Time, hints that there are realms of truth beyond the masks they pathetically or comically present to the world.&quot;

===Romantic era===

In the Romantic era, the use of devices such as canon was even more often subtly hidden, as for example in Schumann&#x27;s piano piece &quot;Vogel als Prophet&quot; (1851).
According to Nicholas Cook, &quot;the canon is, as it were, absorbed into the texture of the music—it is there, but one doesn&#x27;t easily hear it.&quot; Peter Latham describes Brahms&#x27; Intermezzo in F minor, Op. 118, No. 4 as a piece &quot;rich in canons&quot;. In the following passage, the left hand shadows the right at the time distance of one beat and at the pitch interval of an octave lower:

Michael Musgrave writes that as a result of the strict canon at the octave, the piece is &quot;of an anxious, suppressed nature, ... in the central section this tension is temporarily eased through a very contained passage which employs the canon in chordal terms between the hands.&quot; According to Denis Matthews, &quot;[what] looks on paper like another purely intellectual exercise... in practice it produces a warmly melodic effect.&quot;

===20th century to present===

Stravinsky composed canons, including a &quot;Canon on a Russian Popular Tune&quot; and the Double Canon. Conlon Nancarrow composed a number of canons for player piano. (See Mensuration and tempo canons below.) Anton Webern employed canonic textures in his work; his Op. 16 work is a collection of five canons for soprano, clarinet, and bass clarinet.

==Types==
Considering the many types of canon &quot;in the tonal repertoire&quot;, it may be ironic that &quot;canon—the strictest type of imitation—has such a wide variety of possibilities&quot;. The most rigid and ingenious forms of canon are not strictly concerned with pattern but also with content. Canons are classified by various traits including the number of voices, the interval at which each successive voice is transposed in relation to the preceding voice, whether voices are inverse, retrograde, or retrograde-inverse; the temporal distance between each voice, whether the intervals of the second voice are exactly those of the original or if they are adjusted to fit the diatonic scale, and the tempo of successive voices. However, canons may use more than one of the above methods.

Contour Canon

A Contour Canon can be recognized in the traditional sense, similar to a strict canon or to a canon by inversion, where an original theme or design is presented, and is then followed by a response of the same theme, as well as in an untraditional fashion, where Subcontouric Cells are positioned in such a way that they assemble a canon. In this untraditional fashion, a contour’s cells are presented and altered in a rotational motion, until the entire image or contour can be seen in its Prime form. Each cell in a pairing of Subcontouric Cells cycles through their rotational variations, until they have established themselves in their intended contour position, or Prime Form, such as (1-1)(1-2), referred to as a contour’s Cell Cycle.
==Terminology==
Although, for clarity, this article uses leader and follower(s) to denote the leading voice in a canon and those that imitate it, musicological literature also uses the traditional Latin terms &quot;dux&quot; and &quot;comes&quot; for &quot;leader&quot; and &quot;follower&quot;, respectively.

===Number of voices===
A canon of two voices may be called a canon in two, similarly a canon of &quot;x&quot; voices would be called a canon in &quot;x&quot;. This terminology may be used in combination with a similar terminology for the interval between each voice, different from the terminology in the following paragraph.

Another standard designation is &quot;Canon: Two in One&quot;, which means two voices in one canon. &quot;Canon: Four in Two&quot; means four voices with two simultaneous canons. While &quot;Canon: Six in Three&quot; means six voices with three simultaneous canons, and so on.

===Simple===
A simple canon (also known as a round) imitates the leader perfectly at the octave or unison. Well-known canons of this type include the famous children&#x27;s songs Row, Row, Row Your Boat and Frère Jacques.

===Interval===

If the follower imitates the precise interval quality of the leader, then it is called a strict canon; if the follower imitates the interval number (but not the quality—e.g., a major third may become a minor third), it is called a free canon.

===Contrapuntal derivations===
The follower is by definition a contrapuntal derivation of the leader.

===Canon by inversion===
An inversion canon (also called an &quot;al rovescio&quot; canon) has the follower moving in contrary motion to the leader. Where the leader would go down by a particular interval, the follower goes up by that same interval.

===Retrograde or crab canon===

In a retrograde canon, also known as a &quot;canon cancrizans&quot; (Latin for crab canon, derived from the Latin &quot;cancer&quot; = crab), the follower accompanies the leader backward (in retrograde). Alternative names for this type are &quot;canon per recte et retro&quot; or &quot;canon per rectus et inversus&quot;.

===Mensuration and tempo canons===

In a mensuration canon (also known as a prolation canon, or a proportional canon), the follower imitates the leader by some rhythmic proportion. The follower may double the rhythmic values of the leader (augmentation or sloth canon) or it may cut the rhythmic proportions in half (diminution canon). Phasing involves the application of modulating rhythmic proportions according to a sliding scale. The cancrizans, and often the mensuration canon, take exception to the rule that the follower must start later than the leader; that is, in a typical canon, a follower cannot come before the leader (for then the labels &#x27;leader&#x27; and &#x27;follower&#x27; should be reversed) or at the same time as the leader (for then two lines together would constantly be in unison, or parallel thirds, etc., and there would be no counterpoint), whereas in a crab canon or mensuration canon the two lines can start at the same time and still respect good counterpoint.

Many such canons were composed during the Renaissance, particularly in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries; Johannes Ockeghem wrote an entire mass (the &quot;Missa prolationum&quot;) in which each section is a mensuration canon, and all at different speeds and entry intervals. In the 20th century, Conlon Nancarrow composed complex tempo or mensural canons, mostly for the player piano as they are extremely difficult to play. Larry Polansky has an album of mensuration canons, &quot;Four-Voice Canons&quot;. Arvo Pärt has written several mensuration canons, including &quot;Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten&quot;, &quot;Arbos&quot; and &quot;Festina Lente&quot;. Per Nørgård&#x27;s infinity series has a sloth canon structure. This self-similarity of sloth canons makes it &quot;fractal like&quot;.

==Other types==

The most familiar of the canons is the perpetual/infinite canon (in Latin: &quot;canon perpetuus&quot;) or round. As each voice of the canon arrives at its end it can begin again, in a &quot;perpetuum mobile&quot; fashion; e.g., &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;. Such a canon is also called a round or, in medieval Latin terminology, a rota. &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot; is one example of a piece designated rota.

Additional types include the spiral canon, accompanied canon, and double or triple canon. A double canon is a canon with two simultaneous themes; a triple canon has three.

===Double canon===

A double canon is a composition that unfolds two different canons simultaneously. A duet aria, &quot;Herr, du siehst statt guter Werke&quot; from J. S. Bach&#x27;s Cantata BWV 9, &quot;Es ist das Heil uns kommen her&quot; features a double canon &quot;between flute and oboe on the one hand and the soprano and alto voices on the other. But what is most interesting in this movement is that the very attractive melodic surface of the canon belies its dogmatic message by offering a moving simplicity of tone to indicate the comfort that particular doctrine provides for the believer. Canonic devices often bear the association of strictness and the law in Bach&#x27;s work.&quot;

===Mirror canon===
In a mirror canon (or canon by contrary motion), the subsequent voice imitates the initial voice in inversion. They are not very common, though examples of mirror canons can be found in the works of Bach, Mozart (e.g., the trio from Serenade for Wind Octet in C minor, K. 388/384a), Anton Webern, and other composers.

===Table canon===

A table canon is a retrograde and inverse canon meant to be placed on a table in between two musicians, who both read the same line of music in opposite directions. As both parts are included in each single line, a second line is not needed. Bach wrote a few table canons.

===Rhythmic canon===
Olivier Messiaen employed a technique which he called &quot;rhythmic canon&quot;, a polyphony of independent strands in which the pitch material differs. An example is found in the piano part of the first of the &quot;Trois petites liturgies de la présence divine&quot;, where the left hand (doubled by strings and maracas), and the right hand (doubled by vibraphone) play the same rhythmic sequence in a 3:2 ratio, but the right hand adapts a sequence of 13 chords in the sixth mode (B–C–D–E–F–F–G–A–B) onto the 18 duration values, while the left hand twice states nine chords in the third mode. Peter Maxwell Davies was another post-tonal composer who favoured rhythmic canons, where the pitch materials are not obliged to correspond.

The notion of rhythmic canon transfers Messiaen&#x27;s idea of mode of limited transposition from the domain of pitch to the domain of time:

Computational methods for finding rhythmic canons, both infinite and finite, with arbitrary generative rhythmic patterns were developed in the 2000s with further generalization to so-called &quot;rhythmic fugues&quot; with a few generative rhythmic patterns.

===Puzzle canon===

A puzzle canon, riddle canon, or enigma canon is a canon in which only one voice is notated and the rules for determining the remaining parts and the time intervals of their entrances must be guessed. &quot;The enigmatical character of a [puzzle] canon does not consist of any special way of composing it, but only of the method of writing it down, of which a solution is required.&quot; Clues hinting at the solution may be provided by the composer, in which case the term &quot;riddle canon&quot; can be used. J. S. Bach presented many of his canons in this form, for example in &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;. Mozart, after solving Father Martini&#x27;s puzzles, composed his own riddles, , using Latin epigrams such as &quot;Sit trium series una&quot; and &quot;Ter ternis canite vocibus&quot; (&quot;Let there be one series of three parts&quot; and &quot;sing three times with three voices&quot;).

Other notable contributors to the genre include Ciconia, Ockeghem, Byrd, Beethoven, Brumel, Busnois, Haydn, Josquin des Prez, Mendelssohn, Pierre de la Rue, Brahms, Schoenberg, Nono and Maxwell Davies. According to Oliver B. Ellsworth, the earliest known enigma canon appears to be an anonymous ballade, &quot;En la maison Dedalus&quot;, found at the end of a collection of five theory treatises from the third quarter of the fourteenth century collected in the Berkeley Manuscript.

Thomas Morley complained that sometimes a solution, &quot;which being founde (it might bee) was scant worth the hearing&quot;, J. G. Albrechtsberger admits that, &quot;when we have traced the secret, we have gained but little; as the proverb says, &#x27;Parturiunt montes, etc.&#x27;&quot; but adds that, &quot;these speculative passages ... serve to sharpen acumen&quot;.

==Elaborate use of canon technique==

* Josquin des Prez, &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé super voces musicales&quot;, Agnus Dei 2: One voice with the words &#x27;ex una voce tres&#x27; (three voice parts out of one), a mensuration canon in three voices.
* Josquin des Prez, &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé sexti toni&quot;, Agnus Dei 2: two simultaneous canons in the four upper voices, and at the same time a crab canon in the two lower voices.
* Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; contains nine canons of increasing interval size, ranging from unison to ninth. Each canon additionally obeys the overall structure and harmonic sequence common to all variations in the composition.

==Contemporary canons==
A famous piano piece, &quot;River Flows in You&quot; in the key of F# minor by South Korean Pianist Lee Ru-ma or Yiruma, features a repetitive canon using the same key progression (F#, D, A, E x2). Since its recognition online, there have been multiple covers of the song, including a mashup of it with Johann Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon and Gigue in D Major.

In his early work, such as &quot;Piano Phase&quot; (1967) and &quot;Clapping Music&quot; (1972), Steve Reich used a process he calls phasing which is a &quot;continually adjusting&quot; canon with variable distance between the voices, in which melodic and harmonic elements are not important, but rely simply on the time intervals of imitation.

<text>In mathematics, the Lebesgue covering dimension or topological dimension of a topological space is one of several different ways of defining the dimension of the space in a
topologically invariant way.

==Informal discussion==
For ordinary Euclidean spaces, the Lebesgue covering dimension is just the ordinary Euclidean dimension: zero for points, one for lines, two for planes, and so on. However, not all topological spaces have this kind of &quot;obvious&quot; dimension, and so a precise definition is needed in such cases. The definition proceeds by examining what happens when the space is covered by open sets.

In general, a topological space &quot;X&quot; can be covered by open sets, in that one can find a collection of open sets such that &quot;X&quot; lies inside of their union. The covering dimension is the smallest number &quot;n&quot; such that for every cover, there is a refinement in which every point in &quot;X&quot; lies in the intersection of no more than &quot;n&quot; + 1 covering sets. This is the gist of the formal definition below. The goal of the definition is to provide a number (an integer) that describes the space, and does not change as the space is continuously deformed; that is, a number that is invariant under homeomorphisms. 

The general idea is illustrated in the diagrams below, which show a cover and refinements of a circle and a square. 
==Formal definition==
The first formal definition of covering dimension was given by Eduard Čech, based on an earlier result of Henri Lebesgue.

A modern definition is as follows. An open cover of a topological space is a family of open sets such that their union is the whole space, formula_1 = . The order or ply of an open cover formula_2 = {} is the smallest number (if it exists) for which each point of the space belongs to at most open sets in the cover: in other words 1 ∩ ⋅⋅⋅ ∩ +1 = formula_3 for 1, ..., +1 distinct. A refinement of an open cover formula_2 = {} is another open cover formula_5 = {}, such that each is contained in some . The covering dimension of a topological space is defined to be the minimum value of such that every finite open cover formula_2 of &quot;X&quot; has an open refinement formula_5 with order  + 1. The refinement formula_5 can always be chosen to be finite. Thus, if is finite, 1 ∩ ⋅⋅⋅ ∩ +2 = formula_3 for 1, ..., +2 distinct. If no such minimal exists, the space is said to have infinite covering dimension.

As a special case, a non-empty topological space is zero-dimensional with respect to the covering dimension if every open cover of the space has a refinement consisting of disjoint open sets, meaning any point in the space is contained in exactly one open set of this refinement.

==Examples==
The empty set has covering dimension -1: for any open cover of the empty set, each point of the empty set is not contained in any element of the cover, so the order of any open cover is 0.

Any given open cover of the unit circle will have a refinement consisting of a collection of open arcs. The circle has dimension one, by this definition, because any such cover can be further refined to the stage where a given point &quot;x&quot; of the circle is contained in &quot;at most&quot; two open arcs. That is, whatever collection of arcs we begin with, some can be discarded or shrunk, such that the remainder still covers the circle but with simple overlaps.

Similarly, any open cover of the unit disk in the two-dimensional plane can be refined so that any point of the disk is contained in no more than three open sets, while two are in general not sufficient. The covering dimension of the disk is thus two.

More generally, the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space formula_10 has covering dimension &quot;n&quot;.

==Properties==
*Homeomorphic spaces have the same covering dimension. That is, the covering dimension is a topological invariant.
*The covering dimension of a normal space &quot;X&quot; is formula_11 if and only if for any closed subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, if formula_12 is continuous, then there is an extension of formula_13 to formula_14. Here, formula_15 is the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere.
* Ostrand&#x27;s theorem on colored dimension. If is a normal topological space and formula_2 = {} is a locally finite cover of of order ≤ + 1, then, for each 1 ≤ ≤ + 1, there exists a family of pairwise disjoint open sets formula_5 = {,} shrinking formula_2, i.e. , ⊆ , and together covering .

==Relationships to other notions of dimension==

*For a paracompact space , the covering dimension can be equivalently defined as the minimum value of , such that every open cover formula_2 of (of any size) has an open refinement formula_5 with order  + 1. In particular, this holds for all metric spaces.
*Lebesgue covering theorem. The Lebesgue covering dimension coincides with the affine dimension of a finite simplicial complex.
*The covering dimension of a normal space is less than or equal to the large inductive dimension.
*The covering dimension of a paracompact Hausdorff space formula_21 is greater or equal to its cohomological dimension (in the sense of sheaves), that is, one has formula_22 for every sheaf formula_23 of abelian groups on formula_21 and every formula_25 larger than the covering dimension of formula_21.
* In a metric space, one can strengthen the notion of the multiplicity of a cover: a cover has &quot;-multiplicity&quot; if every -ball intersects with at most sets in the cover. This idea leads to the definitions of the asymptotic dimension and Assouad–Nagata dimension of a space: a space with asymptotic dimension is -dimensional &quot;at large scales&quot;, and a space with Assouad–Nagata dimension is -dimensional &quot;at every scale&quot;.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Seydlitz (3 February 1721 – 8 November 1773) was a Prussian officer, lieutenant general, and among the greatest of the Prussian cavalry generals. He commanded one of the first Hussar squadrons of Frederick the Great&#x27;s army and is credited with the development of the Prussian cavalry to its efficient level of performance in the Seven Years&#x27; War. His cavalryman father retired and then died while Seydlitz was still young. Subsequently, he was mentored by Margrave Frederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Seydlitz&#x27;s superb horsemanship and his recklessness combined to make him a stand-out subaltern, and he emerged as a redoubtable &quot;Rittmeister&quot; (cavalry captain) in the War of Austrian Succession (1740–1748) during the First and Second Silesian wars.

Seydlitz became legendary throughout the Prussian Army both for his leadership and for his reckless courage. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, he came into his own as a cavalry general, known for his &quot;coup d&#x27;œil&quot;, his ability to assess at a glance the entire battlefield situation and to understand intuitively what needed to be done: he excelled at converting the King&#x27;s directives into flexible tactics. At the Battle of Rossbach, his cavalry was instrumental in routing the French and Imperial armies. His cavalry subsequently played an important role in crushing the Habsburg and Imperial left flank at the Battle of Leuthen. Seydlitz was wounded in battle several times. After the Battle of Kunersdorf in August 1759, he semi-retired to recover from his wounds, charged with the protection of the city of Berlin. He was not healthy enough to campaign again until 1761.

Frederick rewarded him with Order of the Black Eagle on the field after the Battle of Rossbach; he had already received the for his action at the Battle of Kolin. Although estranged from Frederick for several years, the two were reconciled during Seydlitz&#x27;s final illness. Seydlitz died in 1773, and Frederick&#x27;s heirs included his name on the equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin, in a place of honor.

==Early life==
Seydlitz was born on 3 February 1721, in Kalkar in the Duchy of Cleves, where his father, Daniel Florian von Seydlitz, was a major of Prussian cavalry with the Cuirassier Regiment Markgraf Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Schwedt No. 5. In 1726, his father left military service and moved the family to Schwedt, where he became a forestry master in East Prussia; the senior Seydlitz died in 1728, leaving a widow and children in restricted financial circumstances. Limited schooling was available to young Seydlitz; sources differ whether he knew how to speak and write in French, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Frederick the Great&#x27;s Court. One biographer, Bernhard von Poten, maintained that his German was good, and if he knew French, he preferred German and wrote it with a &quot;fine, firm hand, unusually correct, in well-formed sentences and with apt expression,&quot; and he knew enough Latin to express himself well. His future sovereign, Frederick, always addressed him in German.

By Seydlitz&#x27;s seventh year, he could ride a horse well, raced with older boys, and he was, by most accounts, a wild and high-spirited child. At the age of fourteen he went as a page to the court of the Margrave Frederick Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Schwedt, who had been his father&#x27;s colonel. The Margrave was a grandson of the Great Elector, and a nephew to both Frederick I of Prussia and Leopold of Anhalt Dessau. Himself a reckless man, the &quot;Mad&quot; Margrave inspired in young Seydlitz a passion for feats of daredevil horsemanship. Seydlitz did not limit this passion to horses: the Margrave once dared him to ride a wild stag, which he did. Seydlitz became a skilled horseman, and many stories tell of his feats, the best known of which involved riding between the sails of a windmill in full swing. Seydlitz remained in his position as a page to the Margrave until King Frederick William appointed him as cornet in the Margrave&#x27;s Cuirassier Regiment No. 5 (his father&#x27;s old regiment) on 13 February 1740.

==Military career==

Seydlitz&#x27;s first months as a cornet were made difficult by the regimental colonel, who considered him a spy for the Margrave, and abused him by sending him on useless errands and generally making it clear that the cornet was no match for the colonel. Within a year of Seydlitz&#x27;s commission, the old King Frederick William died and his son, Frederick II of Prussia, ascended to the throne. Frederick claimed Silesia from the Habsburg&#x27;s Maria Theresa, and made a broad appeal to arms. The Margrave&#x27;s regiment played an important role in the ensuing war, during which Seydlitz came to the notice of the King several times. Once, when Frederick asked the caliber of the artillery shelling the Prussian line, opinions were divided and vague. Seydlitz rode in front of the battery, halting in their line of fire. When he saw a ball hit the ground, he picked it up, wrapped it in his handkerchief and presented it to the King.

In May 1742, while stationed with his regiment in Kranowitz during the First Silesian War, the regimental colonel ordered him to take 30 men and hold a village post until infantry came to his assistance; despite heavy fire, the grudging colonel did not send reinforcements. Realizing what had happened, the brigade&#x27;s general took three squadrons of heavy cavalry to relieve Seydlitz, but these were turned back by fire from the Austrian line. Subsequently, Seydlitz was forced to surrender his small unit. He entered into Austrian captivity with several of his closest comrades, including Charles de Warnery.

Frederick exchanged an Austrian captain for Cornet Seydlitz. Upon his return from captivity, Seydlitz had a choice to wait for the first lieutenancy that became available in a cuirassier regiment, or take the immediate command of a troop of hussars, as a captain. Hussars were the newest form of service in the Prussian army, and not as prestigious an assignment as cuirassiers, but Seydlitz chose the immediate promotion to a lesser unit. In 1743, the King made him a &quot;Rittmeister&quot; (captain) in the 4th Hussars. He entirely skipped the rank of lieutenant. With the 4th Hussars, he was stationed in the city of Trebnitz and he brought his squadron to a state of conspicuous efficiency.

In August 1744, the King entered Bohemia, took Prague, and then moved south. Lieutenant General Count Nassau led the vanguard, and Seydlitz participated with the Natzmer Hussars, commanded by Major Hans Heinrich Adam Schütz, a violent man of whose conduct of warfare Seydlitz disapproved. Seydlitz served through the Second Silesian War. On 22 May, Hans Karl von Winterfeldt, trusted by the King as a good judge of character, reported to Frederick: &quot;Certainly, at Hohenfriedberg, on the 4 June, [Seydlitz] captured the Saxon general [Georg Sigismund] von Schlichting personally, after he had cut the reins from him.&quot; Based largely on his conduct at Hohenfriedberg and Winterfeldt&#x27;s recommendation, Frederick promoted Seydlitz to major on 28 July at the unusually young age of twenty-four.

Seydlitz led his squadron at the Battle of Soor on 30 September, scouting the enemy&#x27;s position before the battle, and then participating in the action. He was also present in the engagement at Katholisch-Hennersdorf on 23 November, which proved convincingly to Frederick the benefit of close support during a cavalry charge. At the successful action on 27 November, Seydlitz led 15 squadrons in an attack on the Austrian rear guard. The Austrians were dispersed and nearly destroyed.

===Development of cavalry tactics===

After Frederick concluded the peace on 25 December 1748, Seydlitz returned with his squadron to Trebnitz. In the subsequent years of peace, Seydlitz developed flexible cavalry tactics. He assembled a plan on tactical form and training for the Prussian cavalry and presented it to the King. Frederick approved the procedures and Seydlitz established a rigorous training program. He would leave his own estate by jumping the gate; he required similar horsemanship from all his men, regardless of whether they were cuirassiers, hussars or dragoons. They had to be capable of galloping across broken fields, wheeling in formation, and riding in close action. Furthermore, they had to be prepared to support any movement of infantry, or to react to any action from the enemy. Under Seydlitz&#x27;s direction, possibly influenced by the ideas of Frederik Sirtema van Grovestins, Prussian cavalry learned to use only their swords, as pistols or carbines could not be fired with accuracy and had to be reloaded. Frederick set up straw dummies for his troopers to shoot; their shots were woefully inaccurate, but Seydlitz&#x27;s tactics demonstrated that the troopers could hit their target with a sword every time. Generally, cavalry horses were the sturdy warm-blood Trakehners, from Frederick&#x27;s stud farm in Trakehnen, East Prussia.

On 21 September 1752, after a successful review in which the different cavalry forms demonstrated their competencies, the King promoted Seydlitz to lieutenant colonel and the commander-in-chief of cavalry and, on 13 October of the same year, to the commander of the Dragoon Regiment Württemberg No. 12, whose staff was at Treptow. Frederick was not satisfied with the regiment&#x27;s performance, and instructed Seydlitz to &quot;put it back into order&quot;. In 1753 Frederick appointed Seydlitz to the command of the 8th Cuirassiers. In Seydlitz&#x27;s hands, this regiment soon became a model for the rest of the Prussian Army&#x27;s mounted force. In 1755 Frederick promoted him to colonel.

By the start of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Seydlitz&#x27;s transformed cavalry had become Frederick&#x27;s pride and joy: it had unrivaled training and an &quot;esprit de corps&quot; bolstered by Frederick&#x27;s confidence in its members, and by their confidence in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz&#x27;s cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz&#x27;s cavalry became Frederick&#x27;s weapon of choice.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

In May 1757, in defiance of the custom of holding the heavy cavalry in reserve, Seydlitz brought his regiment forward to join the advance guard at the Battle of Prague. Here he nearly lost his life attempting to ride through a marshy pool; his horse became stuck in quicksand and his troopers pulled him away. At the Prussian loss at Kolin in June 1757, he and a cavalry brigade checked the Austrian pursuit by a brilliant charge. Two days later, the King promoted him to major general and awarded him the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;. Seydlitz felt he had deserved the promotion for a long time, for he responded to Hans Joachim von Zieten&#x27;s congratulations by saying, &quot;It was high time, Excellency, if they wanted more work out of me. I am already thirty-six.&quot;

Another example of his leadership and his &quot;coup d&#x27;œil&quot;, the ability to see at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King&#x27;s brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz&#x27;s wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.

===Battle of Rossbach===
On the morning of the Battle of Rossbach, Frederick passed over two senior generals and placed Seydlitz in command of the whole of the cavalry, much to those men&#x27;s annoyance and to Seydlitz&#x27;s satisfaction. At Rossbach, Seydlitz&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;œil&quot; and his understanding of the King&#x27;s objectives led to battlefield success. After positioning the cavalry in two ranked lines, he watched the French army move for several minutes, while puffing on his pipe; his troopers never took their eyes off him. When he threw his pipe away, this was the signal they had waited for: the first line of massed squadrons surged forward, smashing the unprepared French in the flank. Typically, cavalry action in the mid-eighteenth century meant a single cavalry charge; the cavalry would spend the rest of the action pursuing fleeing troops. At Rossbach, though, not content with this single attack, Seydlitz called his second formation of squadrons in another charge; he then withdrew all 38 squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. Without waiting for new orders from the King, Seydlitz deployed the Prussian cavalry a third time; this proved a critical factor in the battle. As trained, Seydlitz&#x27;s squadrons charged headlong into the French columns: a massive wall of horses galloping flank to flank, their riders flashing swords and maneuvering at full speed. By the end of the battle, only seven infantry battalions of Frederick&#x27;s army had fired a shot; the rest of the victory had been the work of Seydlitz&#x27;s 38 squadrons and Karl Friedrich von Moller&#x27;s artillery.

That day, the Prussians took as trophies 72 cannons (62 percent of the French/Imperial artillery), seven flags, and 21 standards. With some 3,500 horsemen and 20 cannons, plus a portion of Prince Henry&#x27;s regiment of infantry, the Prussian army had defeated the combined armies of two European powers, France and the Holy Roman Empire. The tactics at Rossbach became a landmark in the history of military art. The same night, on the field, the King awarded Seydlitz the Order of the Black Eagle, and promoted him to lieutenant general. Seydlitz had been wounded during the melée and he remained out of action for four months, nursed by a lady in Leipzig.

===Campaign 1758–59===
Seydlitz rejoined the King in 1758 and on 25 August, at the Battle of Zorndorf, Seydlitz&#x27;s cavalry again secured the victory. He led thirty-six squadrons into a mass of Russian cavalry mingled with infantry. This charge broke the Russian right wing and sent them running for the woods. At the Prussian debacle at Hochkirch, on 14 October 1758, he covered the Prussian retreat with 108 squadrons, and in the disaster of Kunersdorf, on 12 August 1759, he received another severe wound in a hopeless attempt to storm a hill held by the Russians; his 8th Cuirassiers was one of the few intact regiments at the end of the battle. While recuperating in Berlin, he helped organize a defense of the city during the Austro-Russian raid (October 1760). Although he was unable to prevent the Russians from briefly occupying the city, Frederick later praised Seydlitz for his conduct.

Seydlitz&#x27;s health frequently kept him off the battlefield, and he did not reappear at the front until 1761. Then, he received command of a wing of Prince Henry&#x27;s army, composed of troops of all arms, and many of his fellow officers expressed doubts as to his fitness for this command, as his service had been with the cavalry exclusively. Subsequently, though, at Freiberg on 29 October 1762, his direction of both his infantry and his cavalry in turn decided the outcome of the battle.

==Later life==
After the Seven Years&#x27; War concluded with the Treaty of Hubertusburg (1763), Seydlitz became inspector general of the cavalry in Silesia, where eleven regiments were permanently stationed and where Frederick sent all his most promising officers to be trained. In 1767, Frederick promoted Seydlitz to general of cavalry.

Seydlitz&#x27;s later years were marred by domestic unhappiness. During his convalescence in Berlin, on 18 April 1761, he had married Susannah Johanna Albertine Hacke, daughter of Hans Christoph Friedrich Graf von Hacke, and she was eventually unfaithful to him, reportedly due to the syphilis from which he had suffered for decades. He had at least one daughter, according to an early biographer, Anton König, and two according to another biographer, Robert Lawley. The oldest daughter married first to an official from Breslau, and was divorced. She married second to a Polish count, and divorced soon after. She eventually converted to Catholicism, but died in a madhouse in Brieg. The youngest lived to old age and died in poverty near Lausitz.

By the end of the decade, some misunderstanding brought an end to his formerly close friendship with the King. Seydlitz&#x27;s health had been declining for years and he suffered from recurrent bouts of syphilis; in 1772, after an attack of apoplexy, he completed a couple of stays at the spa at Carlsbad to take the mineral waters. While these helped somewhat, his other activities continued without moderation, and to his detriment. A subordinate brought him two healthy Circassian beauties, whose company he enjoyed but who undoubtedly stressed his tenuous health. In August 1773, in his last illness, Frederick and Seydlitz met again at Seydlitz&#x27;s home at Minkovsky near Ohlau (now Oława, Poland). The King sat beside his sickbed, horrified at Seydlitz&#x27;s condition, and even persuaded him to take some of his medications, but Seydlitz would not look at him; the illness had already deformed his face. Eventually paralyzed, whether from another stroke or the underlying tertiary syphilis, Seydlitz died at Ohlau in Silesia in November 1773.

==Character==
Seydlitz was generally admired for the superb &quot;coup d&#x27;œil&quot; that allowed him to utilize the cavalry to its full potential. His 19th-century biographer, K. A. Varnhagen von Ense, related that Seydlitz lived above all for the service, and promoted the training of his hussars before all else. According to Anton Balthasar König, who wrote in 1780–1790, Seydlitz performed best at taverns and excelled in practical jokes: one would gather that Seydlitz was a drunkard, a rake, and a savage, but another of his biographers, Bernhard von Poten, cited conflicting descriptions offered by Seydlitz&#x27;s contemporaries, particularly Warnery, as more accurate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to support König&#x27;s assertion, at least of Seydlitz&#x27;s excesses: Seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years, although he smoked a pipe rather than using snuff, as many officers did; he was indeed reckless, as his career testified; he enjoyed the company of women; and Seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness.

==Memorials==

In 1851, Frederick William IV, Frederick&#x27;s great-great nephew, included Seydlitz&#x27;s name on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin, honoring those who had helped to build the Prussian state. Seydlitz holds a position of honor as one of the four full-sized mounted figures, sharing the first tier of the plinth with the King&#x27;s brother, his cousin, and Hans Joachim von Zieten. A bronze sculpture installed at Wilhelmplatz, in Berlin, was created by Anton Lulvès, a copper worker from Hamburg. , representing the first generation of battlecruisers, was ordered in 1910 and commissioned in May 1913, the fourth such vessel built for the Imperial German Navy&#x27;s High Seas Fleet. The heavy cruiser , of the , was launched in 1939, but never completed.

<doc id="398890" wikidata="Q243322" url="?curid=398890" title="Gujranwala">
<text>Gujranwala (Punjabi / , ) is the fourth most-populous city in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Located in northern Punjab&#x27;s Rachna Doab, it serves as the headquarters of the eponymous district and division. It is also known as &quot;City of Wrestlers&quot; and is quite famous for its food. A metropolitan hub, it is the fifth-most populous in the country.

Founded in the 18th century, Gujranwala is a relatively modern town compared to the many nearby millennia-old cities of northern Punjab. The birthplace of Ranjit Singh, the city served as the capital of the Punjabi state of Sukerchakia Misl between 1763 and 1799; and of the Sikh Empire from 1799 to 1801, succeeded by Lahore.

Gujranwala is now Pakistan&#x27;s third largest industrial centre after Karachi and Faisalabad, and contributes 5% to 9% of Pakistan&#x27;s national GDP. The city is part of a network of large urban centres in north-east Punjab province that forms one of Pakistan&#x27;s mostly highly industrialized regions. Along with the nearby cities of Sialkot and Gujrat, Gujranwala forms part of the so-called &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; of industrial cities with export-oriented economies.

==Etymology==
Gujranwala&#x27;s name means &quot;Abode of the Gujjars&quot; in Punjabi, and was named after the Gujjar tribe that live in northern Punjab. One local narrative suggests that the town was named after a Gujjar, Choudhry Gujjar, owner of the town&#x27;s Persian wheel that supplied water to the town. Evidence suggests, however, that the city derives its name from Serai Gujran (meaning &quot;inn of Gujjars&quot;), a village once located near what is now Gujranwala&#x27;s Khiyali Gate.

==History==
===Founding===
Gujranwala was founded by Gurjars in the eighteenth century&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/22march2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; however the exact origins of Gujranwala are unclear. Unlike the ancient nearby cities of Sialkot and Lahore, Gujranwala is a relatively modern city. It may have been established as a village in the middle of the 16th century. Locals traditionally believe that Gujranwala&#x27;s original name was Khanpur Sansi, though recent scholarship suggests that the village was possibly Serai Gujran instead – a village once located near what is now Gujranwala&#x27;s Khiyali Gate that was mentioned by several sources during the 18th-century invasion of Ahmad Shah Abdali.

===Sikh===
In 1707, with the death of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Mughal power began to rapidly weaken especially following Nader Shah&#x27;s invasion in 1739 and then completely dissipated from the Punjab region due to the invasions of Ahmad Shah Abdali who raided Punjab many times between 1747 and 1772 causing much devastation and chaos.

Abdali&#x27;s control over the region began to weaken in the latter part of the 18th century with the rise of the Sikh Misls (independent chieftainships usually consisting of the chief&#x27;s kinsmen) who overran Punjab. Charat Singh, ruler of the Sukerchakia Misl, established himself in a fort which he had built in the area of Gujranwala between 1756 and 1758.

Nuruddin, a Jammu-based Afghan (Pashtun) general, was ordered by Abdali to subdue the Sikhs but was driven back at Sialkot by Sikh soldiers led by Charat Singh. In 1761, Khwaja Abed Khan, Abdali&#x27;s governor in Lahore, tried to besiege Charat Singh&#x27;s base in Gujranwala but the bid misfired. The Sikh misls rallied to his support by attacking Afghan officers wherever they were found. A fleeing Abed Khan was pursued by Sikh contingents led by the Ahluwalia misl into Lahore, where he was killed. Charat Singh made Gujranwala the capital of his misl in 1763.

In a 1774 battle waged in Jammu, Charat Singh of the Sukerchakia misl and Jhanda Singh of the powerful Bhangi misl, fighting on opposite sides, were both killed. Before his death, Charat Singh had become master of large and contiguous territories in the three doabs between the Indus and the Ravi. He was succeeded by his son Maha Singh who added to the lands that Charat Singh had not only captured but also capably administered.

In the Gujranwala area in the 1770s, the Jat Chathas of Wazirabad and Rajput Bhattis of Hafizabad (Muslims in both cases) offered &#x27;fierce resistance&#x27; to the Sukerchakias, whose attack was aided by Sahib Singh of the Bhangi misl. Describing the conflict, the (British) writer of the Gujranwala Gazetteer wrote that besieged for weeks in his fortress, Ghulam Muhammad Chatha eventually surrendered after Maha Singh assured him safe passage to Mecca, but the promise was &#x27;basely broken&#x27; when Ghulam Muhammad was shot and his fortress razed to the ground. Rasoolnagar (Prophet&#x27;s city) which belonged to the Chathas was renamed Ramnagar (Ram&#x27;s city) to humiliate the Muslims. The Gazetteer noted that the treacherous killing of Chatha and his resistance was remembered &#x27;in many a local ballad&#x27; in Gujranwala. The Bhattis of Hafizabad tehsil, who were Muslim Rajputs, did not cease their resistance to the Sukerchakias until 1801 when their leaders were killed and their possessions captured. Some Bhattis fled to Jhang.

Ranjit Singh, Maha Singh&#x27;s son and successor who would later go on to establish the Sikh Empire, was born in 1780 in Gujranwala&#x27;s Purani Mandi market. Ranjit Singh maintained Gujranwala as his capital initially after rising to power in 1792. His most famous military commander Hari Singh Nalwa, who was also from Gujranwala, built a high mud wall around Gujranwala during this era and established the city&#x27;s new grid street-plan that exists until the present day. Gujranwala remained Ranjit Singh&#x27;s capital until he captured Lahore from the Durrani Afghans in 1799, at which point the capital was moved there, leading to the relative decline of Gujranwala in favour of Lahore.Jind Kaur, the last queen of Ranjit Singh and mother of Duleep Singh, was born in Gujranwala in 1817.

By 1839, the city&#x27;s bazaars were home to an estimated 500 shops, while the city had been surrounded by a number of pleasure gardens, including one established by Hari Nalwa Singh that was famous for its vast array of exotic plants.

===British===
The area was captured by the British Empire in 1848, and rapidly developed thereafter. Gujranwala was incorporated as a municipality in 1867, and the city&#x27;s Brandreth, Khiyali, and Lahori Gates built atop the site of Sikh-era gates were completed in 1869. A new clocktower was built in central Gujranwala to mark the city&#x27;s centre in 1906.

Christian missionaries were brought to the region during British colonial rule, and Gujranwala became home to numerous churches and schools. The city&#x27;s first Presbyterian Church was established in 1875 in the Civil Lines area – a settlement built one mile north of the old city to house Gujranwala&#x27;s European population. A theological seminary was established in 1877, and a Christian technical school in 1900.

The North-Western Railway connected Gujranwala with other cities in British India by rail in 1881. The major Sikh higher learning institution, Gujranwala Guru Nanak Khalsa College, was founded in Gujranwala in 1889, though it later shifted to Ludhiana. The nearby Khanki Headworks were completed in 1892 under British rule, and helped irrigate 3 million acres in the province. Gujranwala&#x27;s population, according to the 1901 census of British India, was 29,224. The city continued to grow rapidly for the remainder of British rule.

Riots erupted in Gujranwala following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar in April 1919. These were some of most violent riots in response to the massacre in all of British India. Riots lead to the damage of the city&#x27;s railway station and burning of the city&#x27;s Tehsil Office, Clock Tower, Dak Bangla and city courts. Much of the city&#x27;s historical record was burnt in the attacked offices. Protestors in the city, nearby villages, and a procession from Dhullay were fired upon with machine-guns mounted to low-flying planes, and subjected to aerial bombardment from the Royal Air Force under the control of Reginald Edward Harry Dyer.

According to the 1941 census, 269,528 out of the Gujranwala District&#x27;s 912,234 residents were non-Muslim. 54.30% of Gujranwala city residents were Muslims prior to Partition, though non-Muslims controlled much of the city&#x27;s economy. Hindus and Sikhs together owned two-thirds of Gujranwala&#x27;s properties. Sikhs were concentrated in the localities of Guru Nanak Pura, Guru Gobind Garh, and Dhullay Mohallah, while Hindus were dominant in Hakim Rai, Sheikhupura Gate area and Hari Singh Nalwa Bazaar. Muslims were concentrated in Rasul Pura, Islam Pura and Rehman Pura.

===Partition===
Following the Independence of Pakistan and the aftermath of the Partition of British India in 1947, Gujranwala was the site of some of the worst rioting in Punjab. Large swathes of Hindu and Sikh localities were attacked or destroyed. Rioters in the city gained notoriety for attacks, with the city&#x27;s Muslim Lohar (blacksmiths) particularly carrying out brutal attacks. In retaliation for attacks against a trainload of refugees by Sikh rioters at Amritsar railway station on 22 September that resulted in the deaths of 3,000 Muslims over the course of three hours, rioters from Gujranwala attacked a trainload of Hindus and Sikhs fleeing towards India on 23 September, killing 340 refugees in the nearby town of Kamoke. Partition riots in Gujranwala resulted in systematic violence against the city&#x27;s minorities, and may constitute an act of ethnic cleansing by modern standards. Gujranwala became home to Muslim refugees who were fleeing from the widespread anti-Muslim pogroms that depopulated eastern Punjab in India of almost its entire Muslim population. Refugees in Gujranwala were mainly those who had fled from the cities of Amritsar, Patiala, and Ludhiana in what had become the Indian state of East Punjab.

===Modern===
The influx of Muslim refugees into Gujranwala drastically altered the city&#x27;s form. By March 1948, over 300,000 refugees had been resettled in Gujranwala District. Many refugees found post-Partition Gujranwala lacking in opportunities, causing some to move south to Karachi. The refugee population mostly settled in localities that were mostly non-Muslim, like Gobindgarh, Baghbanpura and Nanakpura.

Suburban districts were rapidly laid, including Satellite Town in 1950, which was designed mostly to house wealthy and upper-middle-class refugees. D-Colony was built in 1956 for poorer Kashmiri refugees, and Model Town in the 1960s. The city experienced strong industrial growth during this period. In 1947, there were only 39 registered factories – a number which rose to 225 by 1961. The city&#x27;s colonial-era metal-working industry continued to grow, while the city became a centre of hosiery manufacturing that was run by refugees from Ludhiana. The city&#x27;s jewellery-trade had been run by Hindus but came under the control of refugees from Patiala.

Gujranwala&#x27;s economy continued to grow into the 1970s and 1980s. New development continues, such as the opening of a 5,774-foot long flyover that functions as an elevated urban expressway, as well as the nearby Sialkot International Airport which serves the entire Golden Triangle region, and is Pakistan&#x27;s first privately owned commercial airport. Institutions of higher learning have also been established in the city since independence. The Sialkot-Lahore Motorway, opened in 2020, passes near Gujranwala.

==Geography==
Gujranwala sits at the heart of the Rechna Doab, a strip of land between the Chenab in the north, and Ravi River in the south. Gujranwala is also part of the Majha, a historical region of northern Punjab. The city was built upon the plains of Punjab, and the surrounding region is an unbroken plain devoid of topographical diversity.
Gujranwala is 226 metres (744 ft) above sea level, sharing borders with Ghakhar Mandi and several towns and villages. About south is the provincial capital, Lahore. Sialkot and Gujrat lie to its north. Gujrat connects Gujranwala with Bhimber, Azad Kashmir, and Sialkot connects it with Jammu. About southwest is Faisalabad. To its west are Hafizabad and Pindi Bhattian, which connect Gujranwala to Jhang, Chiniot and Sargodha.

===Climate===
Gujranwala has a hot semi-arid climate (BSh), according to the Köppen-Geiger system, and changes throughout the year. During summer (June to September), the temperature reaches . The coolest months are usually November to February when the temperature can drop to an average of . The highest precipitation months are usually July and August when the monsoon reaches Punjab. During the other months, the average rainfall is about . October to May have little rainfall.

===Urban form===

Gujranwala&#x27;s oldest precincts were laid according to the new city plan devised by Hari Singh Nalwa, following Ranjit Singh&#x27;s establishment of Gujranwala as his capital in 1792. A street plan based mostly on a grid plan was implemented, with bazaars intersecting one another at 90-degree angles. Some of the blocks are rectangular in shape, resulting in a polygonal shaped old city. This old city was then enclosed by a high mud wall with gates and a fort that was built immediately north of the old city. The city&#x27;s Sheranwala Bagh was also expanded under Hari Singh Nalwa&#x27;s direction.

Gujranwala&#x27;s old city is centred on the &quot;Shahi&quot; (Royal) Bazaar. The old city is home to many of the city&#x27;s pre-Partition houses of worship for Hindus and Sikhs. The Hindu Devi Talab temple was once famous for its large water-tank, and remains in good condition despite being used as a residence for a family who fled Patiala. The Sikh Gurdwara Damdama Sahib is located near the Devi Talab Temple, is important in Sikhism for its association with Baba Sahib Singh Bedi, a Sikh saint. An old gurdwara is also located near the Chashma Chowk intersection near Shahi Bazaar.

Gujranwala was also home to a Jain community, called Bhabra in Punjab. In the heart of the town, Lala Mubdas Jain Mandir is present. The samadhi of Jain Acharya Atmaramji (also known as Acharya Vijayanandsuri, who died on 20 May 1896. The samadhi, now being restored, was visited by Jain Acharya Dharmadhurandar Suri in on 28 May 2023, along with other Jain munis and lay Jains after a gap to more than 75 years.

Gujranwala grew rapidly following British rule, and connection of the city to the railways of British India. The city grew outside of the city&#x27;s walls, requiring new bazaars to be laid, which were done in a radial plan centred on the old city. Some historic structures like the Haveli of Sardar Mahan Singh were torn down by the British and replaced with other structures. The city&#x27;s Brandreth, Lahori, and Khiyali Gates were built atop the city&#x27;s demolished original gates, while Mahan Singh&#x27;s haveli was transformed into a public square named Ranjit Ganj. The city&#x27;s boundaries remained mostly west of the railways&#x27; line prior to 1947.

The Civil Lines neighbourhood was built for European residents approximately one mile north of the old city. The area was characterized by bungalows, large and verdant lawns, and shady tree-lined avenues. Civil Lines is where the city&#x27;s Presbyterian Church was built in 1875, while the city&#x27;s Theological Seminary was established here in 1877. The Christian Technical Training Center followed suit in 1900. The city&#x27;s elite Hindus and Sikhs eventually also settled in small numbers in Civil Lines. Several of their mansions still remain in the area including those of Charan Singh, Banarsi Shah, as well as other buildings such as Islamia College and Khurshid Manzil.

Growth occurred mostly in areas northwest and southeast of the city immediately after independence until 1965 along routes emanating from old Gujranwala. Satellite Town was established on the southwest side in 1950. Areas northeast and southwest of the city were the sites of most growth between 1965 and 1985. The growth grows outwards mostly evenly after 1985 until the present time. Much of the growth has been unplanned due to poor enforcement of development guidelines and lax enforcement of property laws.

==Demography==
Gujranwala is the 5th largest city in Pakistan by population. Since the 2000s the population growth rate of Gujranwala has averaged at 3.0%. The population growth rate is projected to slow down to 2.51% by 2035. 

==Economy==

Gujranwala is the Pakistan&#x27;s third largest centre of industrial production, after Karachi and Faisalabad. Gujranwala, along with the nearby industrial cities of Sialkot and Gujrat City, form what is sometimes referred to as the Golden Triangle in reference to their relative prosperity and export-oriented industrial base. The city&#x27;s industries employ up to 500,000 people, while the city&#x27;s GDP makes up 5% of Pakistan&#x27;s overall economy.

An estimated 6,500 small and medium enterprises, 25,000 cottage units, and some large factories, are located in and around the city as of 2002 -and are engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of goods. The city is the centre for manufacture and export of sanitary fittings and wares in Pakistan, with over 200 producers based in Gujranwala. More than 60 producers of auto parts are found in the city. The city is well known as a centre for manufacturing electric fans – with 150 small and medium enterprises in Gujranwala tied to the electric fan industry. The city is Pakistan&#x27;s third largest centre for iron and steel manufacturing – reflecting Gujranwala&#x27;s historic association with metalworking since the migration of the Lohar clan of blacksmiths to the city during the colonial era. The city has been a centre of hosiery-manfuacture since the migration of refugees primarily from Ludhiana in 1947.

Textiles, apparel, yarn, and other textile goods are also produced in Gujranwala. Other manufacturing based in the city include rice, plastic, cutlery, coolers and heaters, agricultural tools and equipment, carpets, glass goods, surgical equipment, leather products, and machinery for military uses, domestic appliances, motorcycles, and food products. The rural regions surrounding Gujranwala are heavily engaged in the production of wheat and are yield more wheat per acre than the national average. Gujranwala District is also the most productive region for rice-growing in Punjab.

In 2010, Gujranwala was rated number 6 out of Pakistan&#x27;s top 13 cities in order of ease of doing business by the World Bank, and was ranked the second-best in Pakistan for construction permits. Pakistan&#x27;s electric shortages of the 2010s severely stymied the city&#x27;s growth. Industrial units in the city suffered an average of 2872 hours per year in Gujranwala in 2012. By the end of 2017, the supply of electricity had drastically improved with augmented electric generation as a result of new power-stations coming online. Improved supplies of electricity contributed to the country&#x27;s double-digit rise in exports in the second half of 2017.

==Transportation==
===Road===

Gujranwala is situated along the historic Grand Trunk Road that connects Peshawar to Islamabad and Lahore. The Grand Trunk Road also provides access to the Afghan border via the Khyber Pass, with onward connections to Kabul and Central Asia via the Salang Pass. The Karakoram Highway provides access between Islamabad and western China, and an alternate route to Central Asia via Kashgar, China.

Gujranwala is connected to Lahore by Sialkot-Lahore Motorway. The motorway passes east of the Grand Trunk Road, and terminates near the Sialkot International Airport. Plans for the motorway&#x27;s extension farther north to Kharian near Gujrat City were announced in late 2017.

===Rail===

Gujranwala railway station serves as a stop along Pakistan&#x27;s -long Main Line-1 railway that connects the city to the port city of Karachi to Peshawar.

The entire Main Line-1 railway track between Karachi and Peshawar is to be overhauled at a cost of $3.65 billion for the first phase of the project, with completion by 2021. Upgrading of the railway line will permit train travel at speeds of 160 kilometres per hour, versus the average 60 to 105 km per hour speed currently possible on existing track.

===Air===
Gujranwala has no airport of its own. The city is instead served by airports in nearby cities, including the Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore that offers non-stop flights to Europe, Canada, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. Gujranwala is also serviced by the nearby Sialkot International Airport – Pakistan&#x27;s first privately owned commercial airport. Built-in 2007, the airport offers non-stop service to the Middle East, as well as domestic locations.

===Public transportation===
Gujranwala has a small scale centrally managed public transportation system known as a city tour. It has its routes from Wazirabad to Kamoke mainly extended on GT road only. Uber became available in Gujranwala in early 2017 and was soon followed by Careem.

==Administration==
Gujranwala and its environs were amalgamated into a district in 1951. The Gujranwala Development Authority was established in 1989 to oversee economic and infrastructure development in the city. The city is currently administered by the City District Government Gujranwala (CDGG) and Gujranwala Metropolitan Corporation, while development is generally under the office of the Gujranwala Development Authority. In 2007, the city was re-classified as a city district with 7 constituent municipalities: Aroop, Kamonke, Khiali Shahpur, Nandipur, Nowshera Virkan, Qila Didar Singh, and Wazirabad Towns.

In December 2019, Gujranwala Municipal Corporation was upgraded into Metropolitan Corporation under Punjab Local Government Act 2019.

==Education==

Gujranwala city&#x27;s adult literacy rate in 2008 was 73%, which rose to 87% in the 15–24 age group throughout Gujranwala District, including rural areas. The city is also home to the Gujranwala Theological Seminary which was established in Sialkot in 1877, and moved to Gujranwala in 1912. The Army Aviation School of the Pakistan Air Force was moved to Gujranwala in 1987 from Dhamial. Many institutes are established for higher education such as:

* University of Sargodha, Gujranwala Campus
* University of Central Punjab, Gujranwala Campus
* GIFT University, Gujranwala
* University of the Punjab, Gujranwala Campus

==Sports==
Gujranwala has the multipurpose Jinnah Stadium, which has capacity of 20,000 spectators. It has hosted matches of the 1987 and 1996 Cricket World Cup.
