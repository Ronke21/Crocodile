<text>Drinking culture is the set of traditions, rituals, and social behaviors associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Although alcoholic beverages and social attitudes toward drinking vary around the world, nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of brewing beer, fermenting wine, and distilling spirits, among other practices. 

Alcohol has been present in numerous societies over the centuries with the production and consumption of alcoholic beverages date back to ancient civilisations. Drinking is documented in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles, in the Qur&#x27;an, in Greek and Roman literature as old as Homer, in Confucius’ &quot;Analects&quot;, and in various forms of artistic expression throughout history.

Drinking habits vary significantly across the globe with many countries have developed their own regional cultures based on unique traditions around the fermentation and consumption of alcohol as a social lubricant, which may also be known as a beer culture, wine culture etc. after a particularly prominent type of drink.

== History ==
Alcohol has played a significant role in human history. The production and consumption of alcoholic beverages date back to ancient civilisations. The earliest evidence of alcohol comes from a Neolithic village dating to around 7000BC in the Yellow Valley. Societies and cultures around the world have made use of intoxicating substances, with alcohol as the most popular, featured in temple rituals for ~2,000 years. In Mesopotamia, the world&#x27;s oldest known recipe for beer-making can be traced back to 3200 BC, with related pictographs dated to 4000 BC. Similarly, wine has ancient roots, with evidence of production in Jemdet Nasr in 3000 BC, Georgia from around 6000 BC, and Iran from 5000 BC. These practices were not just culinary but often held religious and medicinal significance.

Since the Greek and Roman eras, Bacchanalia rituals involved consuming heavy levels of alcohol to reach an ecstatic state of mind. Bacchanalian fraternities promote the festive consumption of wine.

Alcoholic beverages are today some of the most popular in the world. In addition to its function as a social lubricant, more prestigious forms of drinking can form integral parts of fine dining, such as in the form of a wine pairing. The expertise necessary to maintain such traditions can be provided by a sommelier or cicerone.

==Drinking styles==

=== Binge drinking ===

Binge drinking has more than one definition, but all definitions involve drinking to excess. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. For the typical adult, this pattern corresponds to consuming five or more drinks (men), or four or more drinks (women) in about two hours.

The concept of a &quot;binge&quot; has been somewhat elastic over the years, implying consumption of alcohol far beyond that which is socially acceptable. In earlier decades, &quot;going on a binge&quot; meant drinking over the course of several days until one was no longer able to continue drinking. This usage is known to have entered the English language as late as 1854; it derives from an English dialectal word meaning to &quot;soak&quot; or to &quot;fill a boat with water&quot;. (&quot;OED&quot;, &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;)

=== Social drinking ===
Social drinking refers to casual drinking of alcoholic beverages in a social setting (for example bars, nightclubs, or parties) without an intent to become intoxicated. A social drinker is also defined as a person who only drinks alcohol during social events, such as parties, and does not drink while alone (e.g., at home). In many cultures, good news is often celebrated by a group sharing alcoholic drinks. For example, sparkling wine may be used to toast the bride at a wedding, and alcoholic drinks may be served to celebrate a baby&#x27;s birth. Buying someone an alcoholic drink is often considered a gesture of goodwill, an expression of gratitude, or to mark the resolution of a dispute.

Alcohol in association football has long been a complex issue, with significant cultural and behavioral implications. Football is widely observed in various settings such as television broadcasts, sports bars, and arenas, contributing to the drinking culture surrounding the sport. A 2007 study at the University of Texas at Austin monitored the drinking habits of 541 students over two football seasons. It revealed that high-profile game days ranked among the heaviest drinking occasions, similar to New Year&#x27;s Eve. Male students increased their consumption for all games, while socially active female students drank heavily during away games. Lighter drinkers also showed a higher likelihood of risky behaviors during away games as their intoxication increased. This research highlights specific drinking patterns linked to collegiate sports events.

While social drinking often involves moderation, it does not strictly emphasize safety or specific quantities, unlike terms such as responsible drinking or light, moderate, and heavy. Social settings can involve peer pressure to drink more than intended, which can be a risk factor for excessive alcohol consumption. Regularly socializing over drinks can lead to a higher tolerance for alcohol and potentially alcohol dependence, especially in groups where drinking is a central activity. According to a 2022 study, recreational heavy drinking and intoxication have become increasingly prevalent among Nigerian youth in Benin City. Traditionally, alcohol use was more accepted for men, while youth drinking was often taboo. Today, many young people engage in heavy drinking for pleasure and excitement. Peer networks encourage this behavior through rituals that promote intoxication and provide care for inebriated friends. The findings suggest a need to reconsider cultural prohibitions on youth drinking and advocate for public health interventions promoting low-risk drinking practices.

Drinking games involve consuming alcohol as part of the gameplay. They can be risky because they can encourage people to drink more than they intended to.

=== Session drinking ===

Session drinking is a chiefly British and Irish term that refers to drinking a significant quantity of beer during a &quot;session&quot; (i.e. a specific period of time). A session is generally a social occasion. A pub crawl (sometimes called a bar tour, bar crawl or bar-hopping) is the act of visiting multiple pubs or bars in a single session.

A &quot;session beer&quot;, such as a session bitter, is a beer that has a moderate or relatively low alcohol content.

=== Sober curious ===
Sober curious is a cultural movement and lifestyle of practicing none or limited alcohol consumption that started spreading in the late 2010s. Being sober curious means exploring sobriety at times to challenge the systematic consumption of alcohol in different situations, mostly during social interaction. The goal is to cut back when alcohol is deemed unnecessary, avoid consuming too much alcohol, and/or improve one&#x27;s health. The consumption of non-alcoholic drinks is associated with the sober curious movement. It is also called the &#x27;No To Lo&quot; beverages movement.

== Drinking etiquette ==

For the purposes of buying rounds of alcoholic drinks in English public houses, William Greaves, a retired London journalist, devised a set of etiquette guidelines as a Saturday morning essay in the defunct &quot;Today&quot; newspaper. Known as Greaves&#x27; Rules, the guidelines were based upon his long experience of pubs and rounds. The rules were later recommissioned by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and published in that newspaper on November 20, 1993. Copies of the rules soon appeared in many pubs throughout the United Kingdom.

Kate Fox, a social anthropologist, came up with a similar idea in her book &quot;Watching the English&quot;, but concluded their rationale was the need to minimize the possibility of violence between drinking companions.

When it is socially acceptable to drink differs around the world. For example, drinking at early times of the day is frowned upon in some countries, including Britain, Iceland, and the Czech Republic, whose drinkers limit themselves to the evening, some don&#x27;t start until past midnight and stay out especially late.

Though noon is often seen as earliest appropriate time of day to consume alcohol, especially on its own, there are some exceptions such as drinking Buck&#x27;s Fizzes on Christmas Day morning. In Germany, it is tradition to get a drink on Sunday morning, Frühschoppen, to commemorate when families would go to the pub after church. In the countries of Spain, France, Russia, and Germany, day drinking is more common. Drinks served with breakfast or brunch, like a mimosa or bloody mary, are common in many cultures. However, even in countries where day drinking is socially acceptable, it is restricted compared to the heavier periods of drinking recurrent during weekend days.

=== Vertical drinking ===
Vertical drinking means that all or most of the patrons in an establishment are standing while drinking. This is linked to faster rates of consumption, and can lead to tension and possibly violence as patrons attempt to maneuver around each other.

== Social and cultural significance ==
Drinking customs vary significantly across cultures. In many Western societies, raising a toast during celebrations or milestones is a common practice. In contrast, in Japanese culture, the practice of &#x27;nomikai&#x27; – a drinking party among colleagues or friends – is prevalent, reflecting their communal approach to drinking. Similarly, in some Native American societies, alcohol consumption has historically been limited and regulated through community norms.

=== Spiritual use ===
Many religions prohibit or advise against alcohol use. However, spiritual use of alcohol is found in some religions and schools with esoteric influences, including the Sufi Bektashi Order and Alevi Jem ceremonies, in the Japanese religion Shinto, by the new religious movement Thelema, in Vajrayana Buddhism, in Vodou faith of Haiti, and in the Jewish Kiddush.

==By country==
Drinking habits vary significantly across the globe. In many European countries, wine and beer are integral to the dining experience, reflecting a culture of moderate, meal-centric drinking. Conversely, in countries like Russia, higher rates of hard liquor consumption are observed, which has been linked to social and health issues. Furthermore, some Islamic countries have religious prohibitions against alcohol, leading to markedly different drinking practices. Some cultures may have a higher tolerance for alcohol consumption, while others may stigmatize it. Cultural practices, traditions, and expectations regarding masculinity can influence drinking patterns among people.

Some studies have noted traditional, cultural differences between Northern and Southern Europe. A difference in perception may also account to some extent for historically noted cultural differences: Northern Europeans drink beer, which in the past was often of a low alcohol content (2.5% compared to today&#x27;s 5%). In pre-industrial society, beer was safer to drink than water, because it had been boiled and contained alcohol. Southern Europeans drink wine and fortified wines (10–20% alcohol by volume). Traditionally, wine was watered and honeyed; drinking full strength wine was considered barbaric in Republican Rome. Nor does binge drinking necessarily equate with substantially higher national averages of per capita/per annum litres of pure alcohol consumption. There is also a physical aspect to national differences worldwide, which has not yet been thoroughly studied, whereby some ethnic groups have a greater capacity for alcohol metabolization through the liver enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.

=== Asia ===

==== Afghanistan ====
The production and consumption of alcoholic beverages, especially wine, in Afghanistan has a long tradition – going back at least to the fourth century BC. Currently, the possession and consumption of alcohol is prohibited for Afghan nationals. However, the Afghan government provided a license for various many outlets to distribute alcoholic beverages to foreign journalists and tourists, and black market alcohol consumption is prevalent as well. Bringing two bottles or two litres of alcoholic beverages was allowed for foreigners entering Afghanistan prior to the Taliban takeover in August 2021.

==== China ====
There is a long history of alcoholic drinks in China. They include rice and grape wine, beer, whisky and various liquors including &quot;baijiu&quot;, the most-consumed distilled spirit in the world.

==== Korea ====
Korea&#x27;s interest in creating its own alcohol came about during the Koryo Dynasty (946–943), when exposure to foreign cultures and the introduction of distilled water created the basis and technique for distilling a unique alcohol.

Alcohol drinking in Korea helps create and form ties between family members and friends. Drinking is very present throughout traditional family rituals such as honoring ancestors. Aside from traditional holiday and family ritual drinking, alcohol consumption has modernized and become a major aspect of everyday socialization in Korean culture.

==== Philippines ====
The Philippines has its own unique drinking culture and practices that are based on influences from its Austronesian heritage to the colonial influences of Spain, the United States, and Japan.

=== Europe ===
Alcohol preferences in Europe vary from country to country between beer, wine or spirits. These preferences are traditionally associated with certain regions. Hence, the Central European pattern of alcohol consumption is associated with beer-drinking, the Mediterranean pattern with wine-drinking and the Eastern or Northern European pattern with spirit-drinking countries. However, traditional preferences do not necessarily correspond to current drinking habits, as beer has become the most popular alcoholic drink world-wide.

==== Finland ====
Finland has one of the most significant drinking cultures in Europe, with the second highest rate of alcohol consumption in the Nordic countries. Since the early 1960s, the total consumption of alcohol has quadrupled and negative effects of alcohol have increased. Intoxication is not seen as shameful, and is instead praised and seen as a sign of sociality.

One major aspect of modern Finnish alcohol culture is the concept of &quot;Pantsdrunk&quot; (&quot;&quot;), referring to a drinking practice in which the drinker consumes drinks at home dressed in very little clothing, usually underwear, with no intention of going out. Alcohol is mostly consumed on the weekends in Finland.

==== Germany ====
Drinking culture is very prevalent in Germany, particularly with beer. As of 2013, Germans drink 28 gallons of beer per capita each year. Alcoholism is also an issue, with one-fifth of the population being labeled as &quot;hazardous drinkers&quot; in a 2022 study. Germans are able to purchase and consume soft alcoholic beverages and wine at the age of 16. At 18, Germans are legally allowed to buy and drink beer, wine, and other distilled spirits. The legal limit for blood alcohol concentration is 0.5 milligrams per milliliter of blood.

====Russia====
Alcohol consumption in Russia remains among the highest in the world. High volumes of alcohol consumption have serious negative effects on Russia&#x27;s social fabric and bring political, economic and public health ramifications. Alcoholism has been a problem throughout the country&#x27;s history because drinking is a pervasive, socially acceptable behavior in Russian society and alcohol has also been a major source of government revenue for centuries.

==== United Kingdom ====
Throughout its history, the United Kingdom has had the pub as a central gathering spot in the community. Into the modern day, the English pub is a common social gathering place. The United Kingdom ranks 24th in the world for per capita alcohol consumption, with the prevalence of pub culture sometimes being cited as a factor in the country&#x27;s high alcohol consumption. On average, the British drink an average of 9.7 litres of alcohol per year. Statistics in 2023 have revealed that around 71.2% of adults in the United Kingdom drink at least once a week.

=== Islamic world ===
Alcoholic drinks are generally prohibited under Islamic thought, with the Quran including several verses that admonish the consumption of &quot;khamr&quot;, an Arabic term meaning intoxicants that is interpreted to include most forms of alcohol and psychoactive drugs. Due to this, Islamic countries have low rates of alcohol consumption, and it is completely banned in several of them while strictly controlled in others (such as consumption being allowed only in private places or by non-Muslims). However, a minority of Muslims do drink and believe consuming alcohol is not Qur&#x27;anically forbidden, such as the Alevi Muslims of Turkey. 

Research suggests that predominantly Muslims, who live in Muslim-majority or major Muslim minority countries, believe that drinking alcohol is &quot;morally wrong&quot;. This figure is as high as 90% in places including Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Palestinian territories. However the view that is it morally wrong is considerably lower in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, where 1 in 4 Muslims don&#x27;t think of it as morally wrong. On the other hand, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Tunisia are among the countries where more than 1 in 10 Muslims view drinking alcohol as &quot;morally acceptable&quot;. Muslims in Chad and Mozambique were found in the study to have the most lenient attitude towards drinking alcohol, with 23% and 20% respectively considering it morally acceptable (albeit both still have majorities considering alcohol consumption to be morally wrong).

Muslim-majority countries produce a variety of regional distilled beverages such as arrack and rakı. There is a long tradition of viticulture in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt (where it is legal) and in Iran (where it is banned).

==== Somalia ====
Alcohol in Somalia is prohibited by the country&#x27;s Muslim culture, but historically was allowed in the country and continues to exist illicitly. During the period of Italian Somalia, rum was produced from local sugarcane, continuing until the fall of the Siad Barre Government in 1991, though others have reported rum consumption amongst Somali Bantu Christian’s 

==== Sudan ====
Alcohol in Sudan has been broadly illegal since 1983, when the single-party Sudan Socialist Union passed the &quot;Liquor Prohibition Bill&quot;, making illegal the manufacture, sale, and consumption of any form of alcohol for the Muslim citizens of the country. Alcoholic drinks have been banned since former President Jaafar Nimeiri introduced Islamic law, throwing bottles of whisky into the Nile in the capital Khartoum. On 12 July 2020, Sudan decided to allow non-Muslims to drink alcohol.

=== United States ===
The United States is ranked 39th in the world for alcohol consumption in 2024. It is ranked 1st in alcohol misuse among females, with 10.4%. The U.S., in the past, prohibited alcohol from being produced in the country. This notion is still prevalent in the country with the legal drinking age being 21, and a self reported abstinence rate of 38%. Culture varies significantly by state, with northern states drinking more than southern states.

=== Oceania ===

==== New Zealand ====
Alcohol has been consumed in New Zealand since the arrival of Europeans. The most popular alcoholic beverage is beer. The legal age to purchase alcohol is 18. New Zealand has an above average consumption rate of alcohol, in 2016 ranking 32nd globally in per-capita total alcohol consumption.

==== Australia ====
Alcohol is commonly consumed and available at pubs and liquor stores in Australia – all of which are private enterprises. Spirits can be purchased at liquor stores and pubs, whereas most grocery stores do not sell them, although they may have separate liquor stores on their premises. Alcohol consumption is higher, according to WHO studies, than in most European countries and several Central Asian and African countries, although consumption is just as high in Australia as in North America. After tobacco, alcohol is the second leading preventable cause of death and hospitalisation in Australia.

== Health ==
While moderate alcohol consumption is often cited for potential health benefits, such as reduced risk of heart disease, excessive drinking is linked to numerous health risks including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and addiction. The World Health Organization categorizes alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, indicating its causal link to cancer. It is crucial to balance these perspectives to understand the full impact of alcohol on health.

Several studies over recent decades have linked moderate alcohol consumption with a reduced risk of heart disease. However, experts caution that this research may not fully account for the influence of other healthy lifestyle factors or the health history of participants who abstain from drinking.

Policy makers have often expressed concern over &quot;drinking culture&quot; due to negative health effects of excess alcohol consumption. Policy makers often focus especially on patterns of problem drinking. These patterns are often expressed in geographical terms, such as in national drinking habits. Understanding drinking in young people should be done through a &quot;developmental&quot; framework. This would be referred to as a &quot;whole system&quot; approach to underage drinking, as it takes into account a particular adolescent&#x27;s unique risk and protective factors—from genetics and personality characteristics to social and environmental factors.

As early as the eighth century, Saint Boniface was writing to Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, to report how &quot;In your diocese, the vice of drunkenness is too frequent. This is an evil peculiar to pagans and to our race. Neither the Franks nor the Gauls nor the Lombards nor the Romans nor the Greeks commit it&quot;. It is probable, however, that &quot;the vice of drunkenness&quot; was present in all European nations. The 16th-century Frenchman Rabelais wrote comedic and absurd satires illustrating his countrymen&#x27;s drinking habits, and Saint Augustin used the example of a drunkard in Rome to illustrate certain spiritual principles.

These varying capacities do not, however, avoid all health risks inherent in heavy alcohol consumption. Alcohol abuse is associated with a variety of negative health and safety outcomes. This is true no matter the individual&#x27;s or the ethnic group&#x27;s perceived ability to &quot;handle alcohol&quot;. Persons who believe themselves immune to the effects of alcohol may often be the most at risk for health concerns and the most dangerous of all operating a vehicle.

Chronic heavy drinkers display functional tolerance when they show few obvious signs of intoxication, even at high blood alcohol concentrations which in others would be incapacitating or even fatal. Because the drinker does not experience significant behavioral impairment as a result of drinking, tolerance may facilitate the consumption of increasing amounts of alcohol. This can result in physical dependence and alcohol-related organ damage.

Pregame heavy episodic drinking (4+/5+ drinks for women/men) or more drinks is linked to a higher likelihood of engaging in high-intensity drinking (8+/10+ drinks), according to a 2022 study. The study also found that students who pregame at this level report more negative consequences compared to days with moderate pregame drinking and days without any pregame drinking.

Hazing has a long-standing presence in college fraternities, often involving alcohol as a form of punishment. This can lead to dangerous levels of intoxication and severe ethanol poisoning, sometimes resulting in fatalities. High serum ethanol levels are common among affected students.

<doc id="404064" wikidata="Q401499" url="?curid=404064" title="Tarnopol Voivodeship">
<text>Tarnopol Voivodeship (; ) was an administrative region of interwar Poland (1918–1939), created on 23 December 1920, with an area of 16,500 km2 and provincial capital in Tarnopol (now &quot;Ternopil&quot;, Ukraine). The voivodeship was divided into 17 districts (powiaty). At the end of World War II, at the insistence of Joseph Stalin during the Tehran Conference of 1943 without official Polish representation whatsoever, the borders of Poland were redrawn by the Allies. The Polish population was forcibly resettled after the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Tarnopol Voivodeship was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union. Since 1991, most of the region is located in the Ternopil Oblast in sovereign Ukraine.

==September 1939 and its aftermath==
During the Nazi invasion of Poland in accordance with the protocol of Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland on 17 September 1939. As the bulk of the Polish Army was concentrated in the west fighting the Nazi Germans, the Red Army met with little-to-no resistance by the Polish citizens and their troops quickly moved westward. Tarnopol was occupied as early as 18 September 1939 without substantial opposition from the Poles, and remained in Soviet hands until Operation Barbarossa. Monuments were destroyed, street names changed, bookshops closed, library collections stolen and transported in lorries to the Russian archives. The province was Sovietized in the atmosphere of terror. Families were deported to Siberia in cattle trains, mainly Polish Christians.

During the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Tarnopol was overrun by the Wehrmacht on . A Jewish pogrom lasted from to , with homes destroyed, synagogue burned and Jews killed indiscriminately at various locations, estimated between 1,600 (Yad Vashem) and 2,000 (Virtual Shtetl). The killings were perpetrated by the SS-Sonderkommando 4b attached to Einsatzgruppe C, and by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Militia, formed by Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists – renamed the following month as the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police.

In September 1941, the German occupation authorities established Jewish ghettos in a number of towns including the Tarnopol Ghetto with 12,000–13,000 prisoners. Death penalty was introduced, and food severely rationed. Forced labour camps for Jewish slave workers were established by the Germans in the settlements of Kamionki, Hłuboczek Wielki, Zagrobela, and in Podwołoczyska.&lt;ref name=&quot;sztetl.org/en&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Tarnopol ghetto was liquidated between August 1942 and June 1943. The victims were deported to Belzec extermination camp. Many Jews were denounced by Ukrainian nationalists including shortly before the Soviets took over the area in 1944. A number survived by hiding with the Poles.

==Demographics==
The capital of Tarnopol Voivodeship was Tarnopol. After the rebirth of Poland, according to Polish census of 1921, the province was inhabited by 1,428,520 people with population density at 88 persons per km2. The national census revealed that a staggering number of people could not read or write due to repressive policies of the partitioning powers; amounting to over half of the regional population of the Republic. Within the total number of inhabitants there were 447,810 Roman Catholics, and 847,907 Greek Catholics, as well as 128,967 Orthodox Christians. Ten years later, the next national census of September 1931 was conducted using different criteria. The respondents were asked about their mother tongue and religion. The population density grew to 97 persons per km2.

The overall number of inhabitants in the province amounted to 1,600,406 people in 1931 of whom 789,114 spoke Polish, 401,963 spoke Ukrainian as their first language, 326,172 spoke Ruthenian (Ukrainian), 71,890 spoke Yiddish, 7,042 spoke Hebrew, 2675 spoke German, and 287 spoke Belarusian, Czech and Lithuanian. Among the Poland&#x27;s Ukrainian speakers, 397,248 belonged to Greek Catholic Church, and 3,767 were Roman Catholics similar to the majority of Polish language speakers at home; nevertheless, among the Polish language speakers 157,219 belonged to Greek Catholic Church also, like the majority of those who spoke Ukrainian as their mother tongue. The overlapping of religious denominations presented the community as integrated to a considerable degree. Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of Ruthenian (Ukrainian) speakers were Greco Catholics, like Ukrainians, and only 7,625 of them were Roman Catholics. Jews constituted 44% of the diverse multicultural makeup of Tarnopol, speaking both, Yiddish and Hebrew.

Religion was 50% Greek Catholic, 41% Roman Catholic, 9% Jewish. Ethnic Ukrainian Greek Catholics and Polish-speaking secular Jews were in some cases classified as gentile Poles in the ethnic census, and not as Ukrainians or Jews; this explains the difference between the religious and ethnic census numbers.

The results of the 1931 census (questions about mother tongue and about religion) are presented in the table below:

Ukrainian/Ruthenian and Greek Catholic/Orthodox majority minority counties are highlighted with yellow.
==Geography==
The Voivodeship&#x27;s area was 16,533 square kilometers. It was located in south-eastern corner of Poland, bordering Soviet Union to the east, Lwów Voivodeship and Stanisławów Voivodeship to the west, Romania to the south and Volhynian Voivodeship to the north. The landscape was hilly, with the Podole upland covering large part of the Voivodeship. In the north-west there is the Hologory range with the Kamula mountain (473 meters above sea level) as the highest peak (however, the Kamula was located some 5 kilometers beyond the Voivodeship&#x27;s borderline, in the Lwów Voivodeship). Southern part of the Voivodeship was known for its wineries and peach orchards.

The Dniester and the Seret were the main rivers. Border with the Soviet Union was marked by the Zbruch River, along its whole course. Border of the Voivodeship (and at the same time – of Poland) with Romania was marked by the Dniester. The south-easternmost place was the famous Polish stronghold Okopy Swietej Trojcy (Ramparts of the Hole Trinity), which for some time was protecting Poland from the invasions of the Turks and the Tartars.

==Administrative subdivisions==
The Tarnopol Voivodeship was created formally on 23 December 1920. It consisted of 17 powiats (counties), 35 towns, and 1087 villages. Its capital was also its largest city, with population of some 34,000 (as for 1931). Other important municipal centers of the voivodeship were: Czortków (pop. 19,000), Brody (pop. 16,400), Złoczów (pop. 13,000), Brzeżany (pop. 12,000) and Buczacz (pop. 11,000).

The Tarnopol Voivodeship consisted of 17 powiats (counties):
# &quot;Borszczów Powiat&quot; (1067 km2),
# &quot;Brody Powiat&quot; (1125 km2)
# &quot;Brzeżany Powiat&quot; (1135 km2)
# &quot;Buczacz Powiat&quot; (1208 km2)
# &quot;Czortków Powiat&quot; (734 km2)
# &quot;Kamionka Strumiłowa Powiat&quot; (1000 km2)
# &quot;Kopyczyńce Powiat&quot; (841 km2)
# &quot;Podhajce Powiat&quot; (1018 km2)

# &quot;Zbaraż Powiat&quot; (740 km2)
# &quot;Zborów Powiat&quot; (941 km2)
# &quot;Złoczów Powiat&quot; (1195 km2)

==Economy==
Tarnopol Voivodeship was located in the so-called Poland &quot;B&quot;, which meant that it was underdeveloped, with scarce industry. However, agricultural production was good, due to moderate climate and rich, fertile black soil common in these areas of Europe. The southern part of the voivodship was popular among tourists, with the main center in Zaleszczyki – a border-town, located on the Dniestr, where one could spot grapevines, unique to this part of Poland. The railroad network was better developed in the south, with numerous local connections. Major rail junctions were: Tarnopol, Krasne, Kopczynce. On 1 January 1938, total length of railroads within the Voivodeship&#x27;s boundaries was 931 kilometers (5.6 km per 100 km²)

<doc id="404068" wikidata="Q6824538" url="?curid=404068" title="Metro Central Heights">
<text>Metro Central Heights is a group of residential buildings in Walworth in the London Borough of Southwark. It was originally known as Alexander Fleming House, a multi-storey office complex designed by Hungarian-born modernist architect Ernő Goldfinger and constructed in the early 1960s for Arnold Lee of Imry Properties.

==Design==
The design was favoured both by the property developer Imry and by the London County Council as it promised the largest amount of lettable space and therefore the best financial return for the site. Standing at a height of approximately 55 metres at its highest point, the initial plan included three freestanding blocks. Among these, two were seven stories tall, and one was eighteen stories tall, arranged around a central piazza.

It is located on Newington Causeway on the east side of the busy Elephant and Castle junction in inner south-east London.

Ernő Goldfinger proposed three main components of modern architecture, &quot;the permanent structure; the much less permanent services and an even more fleeting component, the human requirements&quot;. 
 These applied directly to the development where its eventual use was not known at the time of construction. Therefore, the internal design of the building was made as flexible as possible, providing open decks which could be readily subdivided and services re-routed.

The building&#x27;s original tenant was the Department of Health and Social Security, known as the Ministry of Health at the time, which probably led to its being named Alexander Fleming House, after the discoverer of penicillin. The development became its headquarters, and shortly afterwards Ernő Goldfinger was commissioned to design two additional blocks, D and E.

The building received a Civic Trust Award in 1964.

The Health Department&#x27;s headquarters became notorious for &quot;sick building syndrome&quot; and the DHSS civil servants were moved out in the early 1990s to a new headquarters across the road, first of all to Hannibal House and then Skipton House. The Executive staff moved to new headquarters on Whitehall, Richmond House.

The design flexibility served the building well when it was saved from demolition and converted into a residential development and renamed &quot;Metro Central Heights&quot; by St George Plc (a division of Berkeley Group Holdings) in 1997. It was narrowly missed off English Heritage&#x27;s roll of post-war buildings worthy of listing around the same time. The conversion cured the sick building syndrome, and added a gym and swimming pool to the complex. It now contains some 400 studio to three-bedroom flats which are in constant demand, especially by &quot;young urban professionals&quot; who value Elephant and Castle&#x27;s proximity to the City and West End. At the time of conversion the distinctive bare concrete specified by Goldfinger was painted white.

Planning permission was granted on appeal for a further 15-storey block by St George Plc named Vantage Metro Central on what was formerly the development&#x27;s surface car park in February 2004. This was completed in late 2008.

This had originally been the site of both the Odeon cinema, also designed by Ernő Goldfinger but demolished by Imry in 1988, and the huge Trocadero cinema that was cleared for blocks D and E of the development itself.

Metro Central Heights became a listed building on 9 July 2013, when the Minister for Culture, Ed Vaizey MP accepted English Heritage&#x27;s recommendation that it should be listed at Grade II.

<doc id="404069" wikidata="Q316669" url="?curid=404069" title="Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild">
<text>Lionel Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, Baron de Rothschild, (8 February 1868 – 27 August 1937) was a British banker, politician, zoologist, and soldier, who was a member of the Rothschild family. As a Zionist leader, he was presented with the Balfour Declaration, which pledged British support for a Jewish national home in Mandatory Palestine. Rothschild was the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews from 1925 to 1926.

== Early life ==
Walter Rothschild was born in London as the eldest son and heir of Emma Louise von Rothschild and Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild, an immensely wealthy financier of the international Rothschild financial dynasty and the first Jewish peer in England.

The eldest of three children, Walter was deemed to have delicate health and was educated at home. As a young man, he travelled in Europe, attending the University of Bonn for a year before entering Magdalene College, Cambridge. In 1889, leaving Cambridge after two years, he was required to go into the family banking business to study finance.

At the age of seven, he declared that he would run a zoological museum and, as a child, he collected insects, butterflies, and other animals. Among his pets at the family home in Tring Park were kangaroos and exotic birds. As a boy, Rothschild was once dragged off his horse and assaulted by workmen while on a hunting ride near Tring, an experience he attributed to antisemitism.

At 21, he reluctantly went to work at the family bank, N M Rothschild &amp; Sons in London. He worked there from 1889 to 1908. He evidently lacked any interest or ability in the financial profession, but it was not until 1908, at the age of 40, that he was finally allowed to give it up. However, his parents established a zoological museum as a compensation and footed the bill for expeditions all over the world to seek out animals.

Rothschild was tall, suffered from a speech impediment, and was very shy, but he had his photograph taken riding on a giant tortoise and drove a carriage harnessed to four zebras to Buckingham Palace to prove that zebras could be tamed.

Though he never married, Rothschild had two mistresses, one of whom bore him a daughter.

== Zoological career ==

Rothschild studied zoology at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Meeting Albert Günther sparked his interest in the taxonomy of birds and butterflies.

Although Rothschild himself travelled and collected in Europe and North Africa for many years, his work and health concerns limited his range, and beginning while at Cambridge he employed others (explorers, professional collectors, and residents) to collect for him in remote and little-known parts of the world. He also hired taxidermists, a librarian, and, most importantly, professional scientists to work with him to curate and write up the resulting collections: Ernst Hartert, for birds, from 1892 until his retirement at the age of 70 in 1930 and Karl Jordan for entomology, from 1893 until Rothschild&#x27;s death in 1937.

At its largest, Rothschild&#x27;s collection included 300,000 bird skins, 200,000 birds&#x27; eggs, 2,250,000 butterflies, and 30,000 beetles, as well as thousands of specimens of mammals, reptiles, and fishes. They formed the largest zoological collection ever amassed by a private individual.

The Rothschild giraffe (&quot;Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi&quot;), a subspecies with five ossicones instead of two, was named after him. Another 153 insects, 58 birds, 17 mammals, three fish, three spiders, two reptiles, one millipede, and one worm also carry his name.

Rothschild opened his private museum in 1892. It housed one of the largest natural history collections in the world and was open to the public. In 1932, he was forced to sell the vast majority of his bird collection to the American Museum of Natural History after he had been blackmailed by a former mistress.

In 1933, he was one of eleven people involved in the appeal that led to the foundation of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), an organization for the study of birds in the British Isles.

On his death in 1937, his museum and all of its contents were given in his will to the British Museum (of which the Natural History Museum, London was then a part), the greatest accession that the institution has ever received. The Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum at Tring is now a division of the Natural History Museum.

Following a visit to Hungary in 1902, Rothschild brought six live edible dormice (&quot;Glis glis&quot;) back to Tring. Some of them escaped and started breeding successfully in the wild. They have now become a localized pest over an area of approximately 200 square miles in a triangle between Luton, Aylesbury, and Beaconsfield, and there are estimated to be at least 10,000 of them. Even though considered an invasive species, they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

Rothschild was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Giessen in 1898, was elected a Trustee of the British Museum in 1899, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1911.

== Political career ==
Walter Rothschild was a Liberal Unionist Party Member of Parliament for Aylesbury from 1899 until he retired from politics at the January 1910 general election.

== Military activities ==

Despite his health, Rothschild served part-time as an officer in a Territorial Army unit, the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry, where he was a captain from July 1902 until he was promoted to major in 1903, before retiring in 1909.

== Zionism and Balfour Declaration ==
As an active Zionist and a close friend of Chaim Weizmann, he worked to formulate the draft declaration for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. On 2 November 1917, he received a letter from the British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, addressed to his London home at 148 Piccadilly. In the letter, the British government declared its support for the establishment in Palestine of &quot;a national home for the Jewish people&quot;. The letter became known as the Balfour Declaration.

== Peerage ==

Walter inherited the British peerage title &quot;Baron Rothschild&quot; from his father Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild in 1915. He died in 1937 at Tring Park, Hertfordshire, aged 69, and was buried in Willesden Jewish Cemetery, London. He had no legitimate children and his younger brother Charles Rothschild had predeceased him, so the title was inherited by his nephew (Nathaniel Mayer) Victor Rothschild.

Furthermore, he also inherited the title &quot;Baron de Rothschild&quot; (&quot;Freiherr von Rothschild&quot;) of the Austrian nobility, which was an authorized title in the United Kingdom by Warrant of 27 April 1932.

In 1838, Queen Victoria had authorized the use of this Austrian title in the United Kingdom.

== Publications ==
Rothschild is the author of around 765 publications. Of these, 27 were co-authored with Ernst Hartert and 16 with Karl Jordan. He published 278 articles in the &quot;Bulletin of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Club&quot; and 318 articles in the &quot;Novitates Zoologicae&quot;, a journal which he established in 1894 with himself, Hartert, and Jordan as editors.

<text>Philip Miller FRS (1691 – 18 December 1771) was an English botanist and gardener of Scottish descent. Miller was chief gardener at the Chelsea Physic Garden for nearly 50 years from 1722, and wrote the highly popular &quot;The Gardeners Dictionary&quot;.

==Life==
Born in Deptford or Greenwich, Miller was chief gardener at the Chelsea Physic Garden from 1722 until he was pressured to retire shortly before his death. According to the botanist Peter Collinson, who visited the physic garden in July 1764 and recorded his observation in his commonplace books, Miller &quot;has raised the reputation of the Chelsea Garden so much that it excels all the gardens of Europe for its amazing variety of plants of all orders and classes and from all climates...&quot; He wrote &quot;The Gardener&#x27;s and Florists Dictionary or a Complete System of Horticulture&quot; (1724) and &quot;The Gardener&#x27;s Dictionary containing the Methods of Cultivating and Improving the Kitchen Fruit and Flower Garden&quot;, which first appeared in 1731 in an impressive folio and passed through eight expanding editions in his lifetime and was translated into Dutch by Job Baster.

==Botanical work==
Miller corresponded with other botanists, and obtained plants from all over the world, many of which he cultivated for the first time in England and is credited as their introducer. His knowledge of living plants, for which he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, was unsurpassed in breadth in his lifetime. He trained William Aiton, who later became head gardener at Kew, and William Forsyth, after whom &quot;Forsythia&quot; was named. The Duke of Bedford contracted him to supervise the pruning of fruit trees at Woburn Abbey and the care of his prized collection of American trees, especially evergreens, which were grown from seeds that, on Miller&#x27;s suggestion, had been sent in barrels from Pennsylvania, where they had been collected by John Bartram. Through a consortium of sixty subscribers, 1733–66, the contents of Bartram&#x27;s boxes introduced such American trees as &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; and &quot;Pinus rigida&quot; into English gardens.

Miller was reluctant to use the new binomial nomenclature of Carl Linnaeus, preferring the classifications of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and John Ray at first. Linnaeus, nevertheless, applauded Miller&#x27;s &quot;Gardeners Dictionary&quot;, The conservative Scot actually retained a number of pre-Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists. He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of &quot;The Gardeners Dictionary&quot; of 1768, though he had already described some genera, such as &quot;Larix&quot; and &quot;Vanilla&quot;, validly under the Linnaean system earlier, in the fourth edition (1754).

Miller sent the first long-strand cotton seeds, which he had developed, to the new British American colony of Georgia in 1733. They were first planted on Sea Island, off the coast of Georgia, and hence derived the name of the finest cotton, Sea Island Cotton.

The presumed portrait, engraved by C.J. Maillet and affixed to the posthumous French edition of Miller&#x27;s &quot;Gardeners Dictionary&quot;, 1787, shows the wrong Miller, John Frederick Miller, son of the London-based Nuremberg artist Johann Sebastian Müller. No authentic portrait is known.

Miller&#x27;s two sons worked under him; one, Charles, became the first head of the Cambridge Botanic Garden.

<text>Prüm () is a town in the Westeifel (Rhineland-Palatinate), Germany. Formerly a district capital, today it is the administrative seat of the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) Prüm.

==Geography==

Prüm lies on the river Prüm (a tributary of the Sauer) at the southeastern end of the Schneifel, which is 697 m high. Prüm is eponymous for the Prüm syncline (Ger. &quot;Prümer Kalkmulde&quot;), the largest of the Eifel-lime-synclines. Here, the only GSSP-point in Germany identifies the geological border between the lower Devonian Emsian and the middle Devonian Eifelian.

==History==

See main article on the town&#x27;s former monastery, Prüm Abbey. In 2005, the Prüm Convention was signed in the city by several European countries.

Ninety-two percent of the town was destroyed by bombing and ground fighting during the Second World War. In 1949, it was wrecked again by an explosion on the Kalvarienberg hill caused by a fire in an underground ammunition bunker. Twelve people were killed, 15 injured and 965 left homeless.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Economy ===
Among the largest employers in the region are MUH Arla, Stihl, Streif, Prüm-Türenwerk and Tesla Grohmann Automation. MUH Arla has its head office at Pronsfeld, 10 kilometres away.

=== Transport ===
Since 1980 it has not been possible to take the train to Prüm, with the exception of freight trains that operated up to the end of the 1990s. In December 2000 the last train went through Prüm, and this was a special event. Since that time, the rail tracks have been dismantled.

The federal highway B265 and B410 cross in Prüm, the autobahn A60 and B51 also run near the city.

Prüm Air Station is located just outside Prüm and is operated by the United States Air Force.

==Prümer Sommer==
In July and August Prüm Summer takes place. It begins with a market and a music competition on the streets on the last Sunday in June. During the next eight Thursdays, various guests meet at the town hall, where there are various competitions, such as a beer jug lift and trunk sawing. There is also a bicycle rally, a fashion show, and dances included in the program.

==International relations==
Prüm is twinned with: Bangor, Northern Ireland; Monthermé (France, since 1962); Fort Madison, Iowa (United States, since 1998)

==Notable people==
* Regino of Prüm, medieval monk and chronicler 
*It seems that Pepin the Hunchback, first son of Charlemagne, was in exile in a monastery in Prüm from ca. 793 to his death in 813.

<doc id="404078" wikidata="Q900456" url="?curid=404078" title="Brauer group">
<text>In mathematics, the Brauer group of a field &quot;K&quot; is an abelian group whose elements are Morita equivalence classes of central simple algebras over &quot;K&quot;, with addition given by the tensor product of algebras. It was defined by the algebraist Richard Brauer.

The Brauer group arose out of attempts to classify division algebras over a field. It can also be defined in terms of Galois cohomology. More generally, the Brauer group of a scheme is defined in terms of Azumaya algebras, or equivalently using projective bundles.

== Construction ==
A central simple algebra (CSA) over a field &quot;K&quot; is a finite-dimensional associative &quot;K&quot;-algebra &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;A&quot; is a simple ring and the center of &quot;A&quot; is equal to &quot;K&quot;. Note that CSAs are in general &quot;not&quot; division algebras, though CSAs can be used to classify division algebras.

For example, the complex numbers C form a CSA over themselves, but not over R (the center is C itself, hence too large to be CSA over R). The finite-dimensional division algebras with center R (that means the dimension over R is finite) are the real numbers and the quaternions by a theorem of Frobenius, while any matrix ring over the reals or quaternions – or – is a CSA over the reals, but not a division algebra (if &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1).

We obtain an equivalence relation on CSAs over &quot;K&quot; by the Artin–Wedderburn theorem (Wedderburn&#x27;s part, in fact), to express any CSA as a M(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;D&quot;) for some division algebra &quot;D&quot;. If we look just at &quot;D&quot;, that is, if we impose an equivalence relation identifying with for all positive integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, we get the Brauer equivalence relation on CSAs over &quot;K&quot;. The elements of the Brauer group are the Brauer equivalence classes of CSAs over &quot;K&quot;.

Given central simple algebras &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, one can look at their tensor product &quot;A&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; as a . It turns out that this is always central simple. A slick way to see this is to use a characterization: a central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; over &quot;K&quot; is a that becomes a matrix ring when we extend the field of scalars to an algebraic closure of &quot;K&quot;. This result also shows that the dimension of a central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; as a &quot;K&quot;-vector space is always a square. The degree of &quot;A&quot; is defined to be the square root of its dimension.

As a result, the isomorphism classes of CSAs over &quot;K&quot; form a monoid under tensor product, compatible with Brauer equivalence, and the Brauer classes are all invertible: the inverse of an algebra &quot;A&quot; is given by its opposite algebra &quot;A&quot;op (the opposite ring with the same action by &quot;K&quot; since the image of is in the center of &quot;A&quot;). Explicitly, for a CSA &quot;A&quot; we have , where &quot;n&quot; is the degree of &quot;A&quot; over &quot;K&quot;.

The Brauer group of any field is a torsion group. In more detail, define the period of a central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; over &quot;K&quot; to be its order as an element of the Brauer group. Define the index of &quot;A&quot; to be the degree of the division algebra that is Brauer equivalent to &quot;A&quot;. Then the period of &quot;A&quot; divides the index of &quot;A&quot; (and hence is finite).

== Examples ==
* In the following cases, every finite-dimensional central division algebra over a field &quot;K&quot; is &quot;K&quot; itself, so that the Brauer group Br(&quot;K&quot;) is trivial:
** &quot;K&quot; is an algebraically closed field.
** &quot;K&quot; is a finite field (Wedderburn&#x27;s theorem). Equivalently, every finite division ring is commutative.
** &quot;K&quot; is the function field of an algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field (Tsen&#x27;s theorem). More generally, the Brauer group vanishes for any C1 field.
** &quot;K&quot; is an algebraic extension of Q containing all roots of unity.
* The Brauer group Br R of the real numbers is the cyclic group of order two. There are just two non-isomorphic real division algebras with center R: R itself and the quaternion algebra H. Since , the class of H has order two in the Brauer group.
* Let &quot;K&quot; be a non-Archimedean local field, meaning that &quot;K&quot; is complete under a discrete valuation with finite residue field. Then Br &quot;K&quot; is isomorphic to Q/Z.

== Severi–Brauer varieties ==
Another important interpretation of the Brauer group of a field &quot;K&quot; is that it classifies the projective varieties over &quot;K&quot; that become isomorphic to projective space over an algebraic closure of &quot;K&quot;. Such a variety is called a Severi–Brauer variety, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the isomorphism classes of Severi–Brauer varieties of dimension over &quot;K&quot; and the central simple algebras of degree &quot;n&quot; over &quot;K&quot;.

For example, the Severi–Brauer varieties of dimension 1 are exactly the smooth conics in the projective plane over &quot;K&quot;. For a field &quot;K&quot; of characteristic not 2, every conic over &quot;K&quot; is isomorphic to one of the form &quot;ax&quot;2 + &quot;by&quot;2 = &quot;z&quot;2 for some nonzero elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of &quot;K&quot;. The corresponding central simple algebra is the quaternion algebra
:formula_1
The conic is isomorphic to the projective line P1 over &quot;K&quot; if and only if the corresponding quaternion algebra is isomorphic to the matrix algebra M(2, &quot;K&quot;).

== Cyclic algebras ==
For a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, let &quot;K&quot; be a field in which &quot;n&quot; is invertible such that &quot;K&quot; contains a primitive &quot;n&quot;th root of unity &quot;ζ&quot;. For nonzero elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of &quot;K&quot;, the associated cyclic algebra is the central simple algebra of degree &quot;n&quot; over &quot;K&quot; defined by 
:formula_2
Cyclic algebras are the best-understood central simple algebras. (When &quot;n&quot; is not invertible in &quot;K&quot; or &quot;K&quot; does not have a primitive &quot;n&quot;th root of unity, a similar construction gives the cyclic algebra associated to a cyclic Z/&quot;n&quot;-extension &quot;χ&quot; of &quot;K&quot; and a nonzero element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;K&quot;.)

The Merkurjev–Suslin theorem in algebraic K-theory has a strong consequence about the Brauer group. Namely, for a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, let &quot;K&quot; be a field in which &quot;n&quot; is invertible such that &quot;K&quot; contains a primitive &quot;n&quot;th root of unity. Then the subgroup of the Brauer group of &quot;K&quot; killed by &quot;n&quot; is generated by cyclic algebras of degree &quot;n&quot;. Equivalently, any division algebra of period dividing &quot;n&quot; is Brauer equivalent to a tensor product of cyclic algebras of degree &quot;n&quot;. Even for a prime number &quot;p&quot;, there are examples showing that a division algebra of period &quot;p&quot; need not be actually isomorphic to a tensor product of cyclic algebras of degree &quot;p&quot;.

It is a major open problem (raised by Albert) whether every division algebra of prime degree over a field is cyclic. This is true if the degree is 2 or 3, but the problem is wide open for primes at least 5. The known results are only for special classes of fields. For example, if &quot;K&quot; is a global field or local field, then a division algebra of any degree over &quot;K&quot; is cyclic, by Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether. A &quot;higher-dimensional&quot; result in the same direction was proved by Saltman: if &quot;K&quot; is a field of transcendence degree 1 over the local field Q&quot;p&quot;, then every division algebra of prime degree over &quot;K&quot; is cyclic.

== The period-index problem ==
For any central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot;, the period of &quot;A&quot; divides the index of &quot;A&quot;, and the two numbers have the same prime factors. The period-index problem is to bound the index in terms of the period, for fields &quot;K&quot; of interest. For example, if &quot;A&quot; is a central simple algebra over a local field or global field, then Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether showed that the index of &quot;A&quot; is equal to the period of &quot;A&quot;.

For a central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot; of transcendence degree &quot;n&quot; over an algebraically closed field, it is conjectured that ind(&quot;A&quot;) divides per(&quot;A&quot;)&quot;n&quot;−1. This is true for , the case being an important advance by de Jong, sharpened in positive characteristic by de Jong–Starr and Lieblich.

== Class field theory ==
The Brauer group plays an important role in the modern formulation of class field theory. If &quot;K&quot;&quot;v&quot; is a non-Archimedean local field, local class field theory gives a canonical isomorphism , the Hasse invariant.

The case of a global field &quot;K&quot; (such as a number field) is addressed by global class field theory. If &quot;D&quot; is a central simple algebra over &quot;K&quot; and &quot;v&quot; is a place of &quot;K&quot;, then is a central simple algebra over &quot;K&quot;&quot;v&quot;, the completion of &quot;K&quot; at &quot;v&quot;. This defines a homomorphism from the Brauer group of &quot;K&quot; into the Brauer group of &quot;K&quot;&quot;v&quot;. A given central simple algebra &quot;D&quot; splits for all but finitely many &quot;v&quot;, so that the image of &quot;D&quot; under almost all such homomorphisms is 0. The Brauer group Br &quot;K&quot; fits into an exact sequence constructed by Hasse:
: formula_3
where &quot;S&quot; is the set of all places of &quot;K&quot; and the right arrow is the sum of the local invariants; the Brauer group of the real numbers is identified with Z/2Z. The injectivity of the left arrow is the content of the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem.

The fact that the sum of all local invariants of a central simple algebra over &quot;K&quot; is zero is a typical reciprocity law. For example, applying this to a quaternion algebra over Q gives the quadratic reciprocity law.

== Galois cohomology ==
For an arbitrary field &quot;K&quot;, the Brauer group can be expressed in terms of Galois cohomology as follows:
: formula_4
where &quot;G&quot;m denotes the multiplicative group, viewed as an algebraic group over &quot;K&quot;. More concretely, the cohomology group indicated means , where &quot;K&quot;s denotes a separable closure of &quot;K&quot;.

The isomorphism of the Brauer group with a Galois cohomology group can be described as follows. The automorphism group of the algebra of matrices is the projective linear group PGL(&quot;n&quot;). Since all central simple algebras over &quot;K&quot; become isomorphic to the matrix algebra over a separable closure of &quot;K&quot;, the set of isomorphism classes of central simple algebras of degree &quot;n&quot; over &quot;K&quot; can be identified with the Galois cohomology set . The class of a central simple algebra in is the image of its class in &quot;H&quot;1 under the boundary homomorphism
: formula_5
associated to the short exact sequence .

== The Brauer group of a scheme ==
The Brauer group was generalized from fields to commutative rings by Auslander and Goldman. Grothendieck went further by defining the Brauer group of any scheme.

There are two ways of defining the Brauer group of a scheme &quot;X&quot;, using either Azumaya algebras over &quot;X&quot; or projective bundles over &quot;X&quot;. The second definition involves projective bundles that are locally trivial in the étale topology, not necessarily in the Zariski topology. In particular, a projective bundle is defined to be zero in the Brauer group if and only if it is the projectivization of some vector bundle.

The cohomological Brauer group of a quasi-compact scheme &quot;X&quot; is defined to be the torsion subgroup of the étale cohomology group . (The whole group need not be torsion, although it is torsion for regular, integral, quasi-compact schemes &quot;X&quot;.) The Brauer group is always a subgroup of the cohomological Brauer group. Gabber showed that the Brauer group is equal to the cohomological Brauer group for any scheme with an ample line bundle (for example, any quasi-projective scheme over a commutative ring).

The whole group can be viewed as classifying the gerbes over &quot;X&quot; with structure group &quot;G&quot;m.

For smooth projective varieties over a field, the Brauer group is an important birational invariant. For example, when &quot;X&quot; is also rationally connected over the complex numbers, the Brauer group of &quot;X&quot; is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of the singular cohomology group , which is therefore a birational invariant. Artin and Mumford used this description of the Brauer group to give the first example of a unirational variety &quot;X&quot; over C that is not stably rational (that is, no product of &quot;X&quot; with a projective space is rational).

== Relation to the Tate conjecture ==
Artin conjectured that every proper scheme over the integers has finite Brauer group. This is far from known even in the special case of a smooth projective variety &quot;X&quot; over a finite field. Indeed, the finiteness of the Brauer group for surfaces in that case is equivalent to the Tate conjecture for divisors on &quot;X&quot;, one of the main problems in the theory of algebraic cycles.

For a regular integral scheme of dimension 2 which is flat and proper over the ring of integers of a number field, and which has a section, the finiteness of the Brauer group is equivalent to the finiteness of the Tate–Shafarevich group Ш for the Jacobian variety of the general fiber (a curve over a number field). The finiteness of Ш is a central problem in the arithmetic of elliptic curves and more generally abelian varieties.

== The Brauer–Manin obstruction ==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth projective variety over a number field &quot;K&quot;. The Hasse principle would predict that if &quot;X&quot; has a rational point over all completions &quot;K&quot;&quot;v&quot; of &quot;K&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; has a &quot;K&quot;-rational point. The Hasse principle holds for some special classes of varieties, but not in general. Manin used the Brauer group of &quot;X&quot; to define the Brauer–Manin obstruction, which can be applied in many cases to show that &quot;X&quot; has no &quot;K&quot;-points even when &quot;X&quot; has points over all completions of &quot;K&quot;.

<text>In ring theory and related areas of mathematics a central simple algebra (CSA) over a field &quot;K&quot; is a finite-dimensional associative &quot;K&quot;-algebra &quot;A&quot; that is simple, and for which the center is exactly &quot;K&quot;. (Note that &quot;not&quot; every simple algebra is a central simple algebra over its center: for instance, if &quot;K&quot; is a field of characteristic 0, then the Weyl algebra formula_1 is a simple algebra with center &quot;K&quot;, but is &quot;not&quot; a central simple algebra over &quot;K&quot; as it has infinite dimension as a &quot;K&quot;-module.)

For example, the complex numbers C form a CSA over themselves, but not over the real numbers R (the center of C is all of C, not just R). The quaternions H form a 4-dimensional CSA over R, and in fact represent the only non-trivial element of the Brauer group of the reals (see below).

Given two central simple algebras &quot;A&quot; ~ &quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;S&quot;) and &quot;B&quot; ~ &quot;M&quot;(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;T&quot;) over the same field &quot;F&quot;, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are called &quot;similar&quot; (or &quot;Brauer equivalent&quot;) if their division rings &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are isomorphic. The set of all equivalence classes of central simple algebras over a given field &quot;F&quot;, under this equivalence relation, can be equipped with a group operation given by the tensor product of algebras. The resulting group is called the Brauer group Br(&quot;F&quot;) of the field &quot;F&quot;. It is always a torsion group.

==Properties==
* According to the Artin–Wedderburn theorem a finite-dimensional simple algebra &quot;A&quot; is isomorphic to the matrix algebra &quot;M&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;S&quot;) for some division ring &quot;S&quot;. Hence, there is a unique division algebra in each Brauer equivalence class.
* Every automorphism of a central simple algebra is an inner automorphism (this follows from the Skolem–Noether theorem).
* The dimension of a central simple algebra as a vector space over its centre is always a square: the degree is the square root of this dimension. The Schur index of a central simple algebra is the degree of the equivalent division algebra: it depends only on the Brauer class of the algebra.
* The period or exponent of a central simple algebra is the order of its Brauer class as an element of the Brauer group. It is a divisor of the index, and the two numbers are composed of the same prime factors.
* If &quot;S&quot; is a simple subalgebra of a central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; then dim&quot;F&quot; &quot;S&quot; divides dim&quot;F&quot; &quot;A&quot;.
* Every 4-dimensional central simple algebra over a field &quot;F&quot; is isomorphic to a quaternion algebra; in fact, it is either a two-by-two matrix algebra, or a division algebra.
* If &quot;D&quot; is a central division algebra over &quot;K&quot; for which the index has prime factorisation
::formula_2
:then &quot;D&quot; has a tensor product decomposition
::formula_3
:where each component &quot;D&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a central division algebra of index formula_4, and the components are uniquely determined up to isomorphism.

==Splitting field==
We call a field &quot;E&quot; a &quot;splitting field&quot; for &quot;A&quot; over &quot;K&quot; if &quot;A&quot;⊗&quot;E&quot; is isomorphic to a matrix ring over &quot;E&quot;. Every finite dimensional CSA has a splitting field: indeed, in the case when &quot;A&quot; is a division algebra, then a maximal subfield of &quot;A&quot; is a splitting field. In general by theorems of Wedderburn and Koethe there is a splitting field which is a separable extension of &quot;K&quot; of degree equal to the index of &quot;A&quot;, and this splitting field is isomorphic to a subfield of &quot;A&quot;. As an example, the field C splits the quaternion algebra H over R with

:formula_5

We can use the existence of the splitting field to define reduced norm and reduced trace for a CSA &quot;A&quot;. Map &quot;A&quot; to a matrix ring over a splitting field and define the reduced norm and trace to be the composite of this map with determinant and trace respectively. For example, in the quaternion algebra H, the splitting above shows that the element &quot;t&quot; + &quot;x&quot; i + &quot;y&quot; j + &quot;z&quot; k has reduced norm &quot;t&quot;2 + &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 + &quot;z&quot;2 and reduced trace 2&quot;t&quot;.

The reduced norm is multiplicative and the reduced trace is additive. An element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;A&quot; is invertible if and only if its reduced norm in non-zero: hence a CSA is a division algebra if and only if the reduced norm is non-zero on the non-zero elements.

==Generalization==
CSAs over a field &quot;K&quot; are a non-commutative analog to extension fields over &quot;K&quot; – in both cases, they have no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, and have a distinguished field in their center, though a CSA can be non-commutative and need not have inverses (need not be a division algebra). This is of particular interest in noncommutative number theory as generalizations of number fields (extensions of the rationals Q); see noncommutative number field.

<text>Joseph Bradley Varnum (January 29, 1750/1751September 21, 1821) was an American politician from Massachusetts. He served as a U.S. representative and United States senator, and held leadership positions in both bodies. He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party.

Born in Dracut in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Varnum was the son of farmer, militia officer and local official Samuel Varnum and Mary Prime. He received a limited formal education, but became a self-taught scholar. Varnum became a farmer, and at age 18 received his commission as a captain in the Massachusetts militia. He commanded Dracut&#x27;s militia company during the American Revolution and remained in the militia afterwards, eventually attaining the rank of major general in 1805.

Varnum took part in the government of Massachusetts following independence, including as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1780 to 1785 and a member of the Massachusetts State Senate from 1786 to 1795. Despite not being an attorney, Varnum also served as a judge, including terms as a Justice of the Massachusetts Court of Common Pleas and Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Court of General Sessions. He was a member of the U.S. House from 1795 to 1811, and was Speaker of the House from 1807 to 1811. Varnum served in the U.S. Senate from 1811 to 1817, and was the Senate&#x27;s president pro tempore from 1813 to 1814.

After leaving the U.S. Senate, Varnum served in the Massachusetts State Senate until his death. He died in Dracut on September 21, 1821, and was buried at Varnum Cemetery in Dracut.

==Biography==
Joseph Bradley Varnum was born in Dracut, Massachusetts, in Middlesex County, on January 29, 1750, or 1751.

At the age of eighteen, he was commissioned captain by the committee of Massachusetts Bay Colony, and in 1787 colonel by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He was made brigadier general in 1802, and in 1805 major general of the state militia, holding the latter office at his death in 1821.

After serving in the Massachusetts militia during the American Revolutionary War, Varnum helped to destroy the Shays insurrection before he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1780–1785) and then the Massachusetts State Senate (1786–1795). He also served as a Justice of the Massachusetts Court of Common Pleas and as Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Court of General Sessions. Before his election to Congress in 1794, he had run unsuccessfully twice — in 1788 to represent the 3rd congressional district, and in 1792 to represent the Middlesex County seat in the 1st congressional district.

In 1794, Varnum was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served from March 4, 1795, until his resignation on June 29, 1811. He was one of six Democratic-Republican representatives to oppose the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. During his last four years in the House, he served as its Speaker.

Varnum was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1811 to fill the vacancy in the term. He became the only U.S. Senator from the Democratic-Republican Party in Massachusetts history.

Varnum served as President &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the U.S. Senate from December 6, 1813, to February 3, 1814, during the Thirteenth Congress. He was also the Chair of the Senate Committee on Militia during the Fourteenth Congress.

After returning to Massachusetts in 1817, Varnum again served in the Massachusetts State Senate, until his death on September 21, 1821.

Varnum died in Dracut, and is interred in Varnum Cemetery in that town. His brother was Major General James Mitchell Varnum who commanded the 1st Rhode Island Regiment from 1775 to 1777, served as a brigade commander at the Battle of Rhode Island and later served as the major general in command of the Rhode Island Militia.

==Slavery==

Henry Wilson, in his &quot;History of Slavery&quot;, quotes Varnum in the debate on the bill for the government of the Mississippi Territory before the United States House of Representatives in March 1798 as having been very strong and outspoken in his opposition to Negro servitude. Varnum developed a strong friendship with Silas Royal, a former slave freed by the Varnum family, who also served with him during the war.

On March 3, 1805, Varnum submitted a Massachusetts Proposition to amend the Constitution
and Abolish the Slave Trade.
This proposition was tabled until 1807, when under Varnum&#x27;s leadership the amendment moved through Congress and passed both houses on March 2, 1807. President Thomas Jefferson signed it into law on March 3, 1807.

<doc id="404084" wikidata="Q1277874" url="?curid=404084" title="Hebbian theory">
<text>Hebbian theory is a neuropsychological theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell&#x27;s repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book &quot;The Organization of Behavior.&quot; The theory is also called Hebb&#x27;s rule, Hebb&#x27;s postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:

Let us assume that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity (or &quot;trace&quot;) tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability. ... When an axon of cell &quot;A&quot; is near enough to excite a cell &quot;B&quot; and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that &quot;A&quot;’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing &quot;B&quot;, is increased.

The theory is often summarized as &quot;Neurons that fire together, wire together.&quot; However, Hebb emphasized that cell &quot;A&quot; needs to &quot;take part in firing&quot; cell &quot;B&quot;, and such causality can occur only if cell &quot;A&quot; fires just before, not at the same time as, cell &quot;B&quot;. This aspect of causation in Hebb&#x27;s work foreshadowed what is now known about &quot;spike-timing-dependent plasticity&quot;, which requires temporal precedence.

The theory attempts to explain associative or &quot;Hebbian learning&quot;, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of neural networks in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning.

==Hebbian engrams and cell assembly theory==
Hebbian theory concerns how neurons might connect themselves to become engrams. Hebb&#x27;s theories on the form and function of cell assemblies can be understood from the following:

The general idea is an old one, that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to become &#x27;associated&#x27; so that activity in one facilitates activity in the other.

Hebb also wrote:
When one cell repeatedly assists in firing another, the axon of the first cell develops synaptic knobs (or enlarges them if they already exist) in contact with the soma of the second cell.

[D. Alan Allport] posits additional ideas regarding cell assembly theory and its role in forming engrams, along the lines of the concept of auto-association, described as follows:

If the inputs to a system cause the same pattern of activity to occur repeatedly, the set of active elements constituting that pattern will become increasingly strongly inter-associated. That is, each element will tend to turn on every other element and (with negative weights) to turn off the elements that do not form part of the pattern. To put it another way, the pattern as a whole will become &#x27;auto-associated&#x27;. We may call a learned (auto-associated) pattern an engram.

Work in the laboratory of Eric Kandel has provided evidence for the involvement of Hebbian learning mechanisms at synapses in the marine gastropod &quot;Aplysia californica&quot;. Experiments on Hebbian synapse modification mechanisms at the central nervous system synapses of vertebrates are much more difficult to control than are experiments with the relatively simple peripheral nervous system synapses studied in marine invertebrates. Much of the work on long-lasting synaptic changes between vertebrate neurons (such as long-term potentiation) involves the use of non-physiological experimental stimulation of brain cells. However, some of the physiologically relevant synapse modification mechanisms that have been studied in vertebrate brains do seem to be examples of Hebbian processes. One such study reviews results from experiments that indicate that long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths can be induced by physiologically relevant synaptic activity working through both Hebbian and non-Hebbian mechanisms.

==Principles==
From the point of view of artificial neurons and artificial neural networks, Hebb&#x27;s principle can be described as a method of determining how to alter the weights between model neurons. The weight between two neurons increases if the two neurons activate simultaneously, and reduces if they activate separately. Nodes that tend to be either both positive or both negative at the same time have strong positive weights, while those that tend to be opposite have strong negative weights.

The following is a formulaic description of Hebbian learning: (many other descriptions are possible)

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the weight of the connection from neuron formula_3 to neuron formula_4 and formula_5 the input for neuron formula_4. Note that this is pattern learning (weights updated after every training example). In a Hopfield network, connections formula_2 are set to zero if formula_8 (no reflexive connections allowed). With binary neurons (activations either 0 or 1), connections would be set to 1 if the connected neurons have the same activation for a pattern.

When several training patterns are used the expression becomes an average of individual ones:

:formula_9

where formula_2 is the weight of the connection from neuron formula_3 to neuron formula_4, formula_13 is the number of training patterns and formula_14 the formula_15-th input for neuron formula_4. This is learning by epoch (weights updated after all the training examples are presented), being last term applicable to both discrete and continuous training sets. Again, in a Hopfield network, connections formula_2 are set to zero if formula_8 (no reflexive connections).

A variation of Hebbian learning that takes into account phenomena such as blocking and many other neural learning phenomena is the mathematical model of Harry Klopf. Klopf&#x27;s model reproduces a great many biological phenomena, and is also simple to implement.

==Relationship to unsupervised learning, stability, and generalization==
Because of the simple nature of Hebbian learning, based only on the coincidence of pre- and post-synaptic activity, it may not be intuitively clear why this form of plasticity leads to meaningful learning. However, it can be shown that Hebbian plasticity does pick up the statistical properties of the input in a way that can be categorized as unsupervised learning.

This can be mathematically shown in a simplified example. Let us work under the simplifying assumption of a single rate-based neuron of rate formula_19, whose inputs have rates formula_20. The response of the neuron formula_19 is usually described as a linear combination of its input, formula_22, followed by a response function formula_23:
:formula_24
As defined in the previous sections, Hebbian plasticity describes the evolution in time of the synaptic weight formula_25:
:formula_26
Assuming, for simplicity, an identity response function formula_27, we can write
:formula_28
or in matrix form:
:formula_29
As in the previous chapter, if training by epoch is done an average formula_30 over discrete or continuous (time) training set of formula_31 can be done:formula_32where formula_33 is the correlation matrix of the input under the additional assumption that formula_34 (i.e. the average of the inputs is zero). This is a system of formula_35 coupled linear differential equations. Since formula_36 is symmetric, it is also diagonalizable, and the solution can be found, by working in its eigenvectors basis, to be of the form
:formula_37
where formula_38 are arbitrary constants, formula_39 are the eigenvectors of formula_36 and formula_41 their corresponding eigen values. 
Since a correlation matrix is always a positive-definite matrix, the eigenvalues are all positive, and one can easily see how the above solution is always exponentially divergent in time.
This is an intrinsic problem due to this version of Hebb&#x27;s rule being unstable, as in any network with a dominant signal the synaptic weights will increase or decrease exponentially. Intuitively, this is because whenever the presynaptic neuron excites the postsynaptic neuron, the weight between them is reinforced, causing an even stronger excitation in the future, and so forth, in a self-reinforcing way. One may think a solution is to limit the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron by adding a non-linear, saturating response function formula_23, but in fact, it can be shown that for &quot;any&quot; neuron model, Hebb&#x27;s rule is unstable. Therefore, network models of neurons usually employ other learning theories such as BCM theory, Oja&#x27;s rule, or the generalized Hebbian algorithm.

Regardless, even for the unstable solution above, one can see that, when sufficient time has passed, one of the terms dominates over the others, and
:formula_43
where formula_44 is the &quot;largest&quot; eigenvalue of formula_36. At this time, the postsynaptic neuron performs the following operation:
:formula_46
Because, again, formula_47 is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix between the formula_48s, this corresponds exactly to computing the first principal component of the input.

This mechanism can be extended to performing a full PCA (principal component analysis) of the input by adding further postsynaptic neurons, provided the postsynaptic neurons are prevented from all picking up the same principal component, for example by adding lateral inhibition in the postsynaptic layer. We have thus connected Hebbian learning to PCA, which is an elementary form of unsupervised learning, in the sense that the network can pick up useful statistical aspects of the input, and &quot;describe&quot; them in a distilled way in its output.

==Limitations==
Despite the common use of Hebbian models for long-term potentiation, Hebb&#x27;s principle does not cover all forms of synaptic long-term plasticity. Hebb did not postulate any rules for inhibitory synapses, nor did he make predictions for anti-causal spike sequences (presynaptic neuron fires &quot;after&quot; the postsynaptic neuron). Synaptic modification may not simply occur only between activated neurons A and B, but at neighboring synapses as well. All forms of hetero synaptic and homeostatic plasticity are therefore considered non-Hebbian. An example is retrograde signaling to presynaptic terminals. The compound most commonly identified as fulfilling this retrograde transmitter role is nitric oxide, which, due to its high solubility and diffusivity, often exerts effects on nearby neurons. This type of diffuse synaptic modification, known as volume learning, is not included in the traditional Hebbian model.

==Hebbian learning account of mirror neurons==
Hebbian learning and spike-timing-dependent plasticity have been used in an influential theory of how mirror neurons emerge. Mirror neurons are neurons that fire both when an individual performs an action and when the individual sees or hears another perform a similar action. The discovery of these neurons has been very influential in explaining how individuals make sense of the actions of others, by showing that, when a person perceives the actions of others, the person activates the motor programs which they would use to perform similar actions. The activation of these motor programs then adds information to the perception and helps predict what the person will do next based on the perceiver&#x27;s own motor program. A challenge has been to explain how individuals come to have neurons that respond both while performing an action and while hearing or seeing another perform similar actions.

Christian Keysers and David Perrett suggested that as an individual performs a particular action, the individual will see, hear, and feel the performing of the action. These re-afferent sensory signals will trigger activity in neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of the action. Because the activity of these sensory neurons will consistently overlap in time with those of the motor neurons that caused the action, Hebbian learning predicts that the synapses connecting neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of an action and those of the neurons triggering the action should be potentiated. The same is true while people look at themselves in the mirror, hear themselves babble, or are imitated by others. After repeated experience of this re-afference, the synapses connecting the sensory and motor representations of an action are so strong that the motor neurons start firing to the sound or the vision of the action, and a mirror neuron is created.

Evidence for that perspective comes from many experiments that show that motor programs can be triggered by novel auditory or visual stimuli after repeated pairing of the stimulus with the execution of the motor program (for a review of the evidence, see Giudice et al., 2009). For instance, people who have never played the piano do not activate brain regions involved in playing the piano when listening to piano music. Five hours of piano lessons, in which the participant is exposed to the sound of the piano each time they press a key is proven sufficient to trigger activity in motor regions of the brain upon listening to piano music when heard at a later time. Consistent with the fact that spike-timing-dependent plasticity occurs only if the presynaptic neuron&#x27;s firing predicts the post-synaptic neuron&#x27;s firing, the link between sensory stimuli and motor programs also only seem to be potentiated if the stimulus is contingent on the motor program.
== Contemporary Developments ==
Modern research has expanded upon Hebb&#x27;s original ideas. Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), for example, refines Hebbian principles by incorporating the precise timing of neuronal spikes. Experimental advancements have also linked Hebbian learning to complex behaviors, such as decision-making and emotional regulation, showcasing its versatility. Current studies in AI and quantum computing continue to leverage Hebbian concepts for developing adaptive algorithms and improving machine learning models.

== Emerging Connections to Quantum Computing ==
A growing area of interest is the application of Hebbian learning in quantum computing. While classical neural networks are the primary area of application for Hebbian theory, recent studies have begun exploring the potential for quantum-inspired algorithms. These algorithms leverage the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance learning processes in quantum systems. This research explores how Hebbian principles could inform the development of more efficient quantum machine learning models.

== Incorporating Inhibitory Neurons ==
Recent research on Hebbian learning has incorporated the role of inhibitory neurons, which are often overlooked in traditional Hebbian models. While classic Hebbian theory primarily focuses on excitatory neurons, more comprehensive models of neural learning now consider the balanced interaction between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Studies suggest that inhibitory neurons can provide critical regulation for maintaining stability in neural circuits and might prevent runaway positive feedback in Hebbian learning.

== Hebbian Theory and Artificial Intelligence ==
In AI, Hebbian learning has seen applications beyond traditional neural networks. One significant advancement is in reinforcement learning algorithms, where Hebbian-like learning is used to update the weights based on the timing and strength of stimuli during training phases. Some researchers have adapted Hebbian principles to develop more biologically plausible models for learning in artificial systems, which may improve model efficiency and convergence in AI applications.


== Hebbian Theory and Cognitive Neuroscience ==
Hebbian learning is increasingly being linked to cognitive processes like decision-making and social learning. Cognitive neuroscience has started to explore the intersection of Hebbian theory with brain regions responsible for reward processing and social cognition, such as the striatum and prefrontal cortex. It is hypothesized that Hebbian plasticity in these areas may underpin behaviors like habit formation, reinforcement learning, and even the development of social bonds.


== Recent Advances in Computational Models of Hebbian Learning ==
New computational models have emerged that refine or extend Hebbian learning. For example, some models now account for the precise timing of neural spikes (as in Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity), while others have integrated aspects of neuromodulation to account for how neurotransmitters like dopamine affect the strength of synaptic connections. These advanced models provide a more nuanced understanding of how Hebbian learning operates in the brain and are contributing to the development of more realistic computational neuroscience models.

<text>Sir John Danvers (c. 1585–buried 28 April 1655) was an English courtier and politician who was one of the signatories of the death warrant of Charles I.

==Life==

Danvers was the third and youngest son of Sir John Danvers of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, by Elizabeth Neville. In his youth, he travelled through France and Italy, developing sophisticated tastes in gardening and architecture, which in later life he indulged at his house in Chelsea. In 1597 he entered the University of Padua as a student, prior to returning to England where he carried on his education at Winchester College (entered 1598), Brasenose College, Oxford (entered 1601) and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn where he was a law student in 1612. Danvers was knighted by James I of England on 3 March 1609; and under Charles I became a gentleman of the privy chamber.

He sat as a member of parliament for Arundel in 1610, Montgomery Boroughs in the Addled Parliament of 1614, Oxford University in 1621, Newport (Isle of Wight) in 1624 and again for Oxford University from 1625 to 1629.

Danvers was engaged in mercantile transactions, and in 1624 he learned that the government were contemplating a seizure of the papers of the Virginia Company. With the aid of Edward Collingwood, the secretary, he had the whole of the records copied out and entrusted them to the care of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, a family friend, who deposited them at his house at Titchfield, Hampshire.

Danvers fell into debt, and from 1630 to 1640 was apparently struggling with creditors. About 1640 he began an active political career in opposition to the king. He refused to contribute to the expenses of the king&#x27;s expedition to Scotland in 1639, and was returned to the Short Parliament of 1640 by Oxford University. In 1642 he took up arms for the parliament, and was granted a colonel&#x27;s commission which he held in command of the Wiltshire foot militia until 1650, but he did not play a prominent part in military affairs. He gives an account of the opening incidents of the war in letters written to friends from Chelsea in July and August 1642.

Danvers was ordered by the parliament to receive the Dutch ambassadors late in 1644, and on 10 October 1645 was returned to the house as member for Malmesbury in the place of Anthony Hungerford, disabled to sit. He took little part in the proceedings of the house, but was appointed a member of the commission nominated to try the king in January 1649. He was only twice absent from the meetings of the commission, and signed the death-warrant. In February of the same year Danvers was given a seat on the council of state, which he retained till the council&#x27;s dissolution in 1653. He died at his house at Chelsea in April 1655, and was buried at Dauntsey. His name was in the Act of Attainder passed at the Restoration.

==Gardener==
At a young age Danvers acquired a fine garden and house at Chelsea: the latter he furnished sumptuously and curiously, and the former he laid out after the Italian manner. &#x27; &#x27;Twas Sir John Danvers of Chelsey,&#x27; John Aubrey writes, &#x27;who first taught us the way of Italian gardens.&#x27; His house, called Danvers House, adjoined the mansion, once the home of Sir Thomas More, which was known in the seventeenth century as Buckingham and also as Beaufort House. Danvers House was pulled down in 1696 to make room for Danvers Street, therefore named after him.

Through his second marriage he came into possession of the estate of Lavington, Wiltshire, where he elaborately laid out gardens.

==Marriages and family==

In about March 1609 he married Magdalen Herbert (&quot;née&quot; Newport), widow of Richard Herbert, and mother of ten children, including George Herbert the poet, and Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury. She died in 1627.

On 10 July 1628, a year after the death of his first wife, Danvers, then reportedly aged 40, married Elizabeth, daughter of the late Ambrose Dauntsey, and granddaughter of Sir John Dauntsey. His second wife died on 9 July 1636.

His children by his second wife consisted of Henry (b. 5 December 1633), who inherited much of his uncle Henry&#x27;s property, and died before his father in November 1654, when Thomas Fuller is stated to have preached the funeral sermon; Charles, who died in infancy; Elizabeth (b. 1 May 1629), who married Robert Danvers, self-styled Viscount Purbeck; and Mary, who died in infancy.

Danvers married a third time at Chelsea, on 6 January 1649, his wife being Grace Hewes, daughter of Thomas Hewes of Kemerton, Gloucestershire, and he had by her a son, John (b. 10 August 1650). Grace survived her husband and died in 1678.

Danvers&#x27; elder brothers were Charles Danvers and Henry Danvers. His brother Henry, who became Lord Danby, was a royalist, and died early in 1644; he left his property to his sister Lady Catherine Gargrave, wife of Sir Richard Gargrave, High Sheriff of Yorkshire. Still in pecuniary difficulties, Danvers resisted this disposition of his brother&#x27;s property, and his influence with the parliamentary majority led the House of Commons to pass a resolution declaring that he had been deprived of his brother&#x27;s estate &#x27;for his affection and adhering to the parliament&#x27; (14 June 1644), and that Danvers&#x27;s eldest son Henry was entitled to the property. The son Henry bequeathed the estate in his power to his sister Ann, who married Sir Henry Lee 3rd Baronet of the Lee Baronets of Ditchley in 1655, and had a daughter, Eleanor, who became the wife of James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon. Lord Abingdon thus ultimately came into possession of the property at Chelsea.

<text>Surak is a fictional character in the backstory of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series and franchises. He is portrayed as the most important philosopher in the history of the planet Vulcan. During an Earth-like &quot;modern age&quot;, when the Vulcans are technological but emotionally driven and violent, Surak founds a movement which reforms the Vulcan way of thinking and lifestyle and leads to the world of logically-reasoning and emotion-suppressing Vulcans known from the TV series. This period in Vulcan history is referred to as the &quot;Time of Awakening&quot;.

The &quot;Time of Awakening&quot; is accompanied by violence unmatched in Vulcan history, according to the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Awakening&quot; (wherein Surak&#x27;s mind is resurrected 1,800 years after his death to restore to modern Vulcans an uncorrupted version of his original philosophy). During the &quot;Time of Awakening&quot; a Vulcan schism of those who &quot;sought a return to savage ways&quot; and &quot;marched beneath the raptor&#x27;s wings&quot; (later the symbol of the Romulan people) perpetrate a cataclysmic nuclear attack upon Surak and his enlightened society. Soon after Surak&#x27;s death, these Vulcan recidivists abandon their homeworld to colonize the planets Romulus and Remus, forming what later comes to be known as the Romulan Star Empire. While Surak&#x27;s philosophy of peace and logic survives for the next 2,000 years only as an underground movement within the emotional, warlike Romulan society (until further shepherded, in the &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Unification&quot;, by the elderly Ambassador Spock in the role of a latter-day successor to Surak), it continues to flourish on Vulcan to become its predominant philosophy.

The &quot;Time of Awakening&quot; and its &quot;ironic violence&quot; noted by Surak, which ends in nuclear holocaust but philosophical maturity, was written by &quot;Star Trek&quot; creators with intentional parallels to modern human society—particularly what they saw as its historical progression toward cultural enlightenment, reason and tolerance interrupted by extreme bouts of cultural regression, irrationalism and fanatical violence.

==Depiction==

The character of Surak in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series backstory, after up-ending the Vulcan people&#x27;s violent tribalism with a philosophy of communal commitment to reason and logic, dies in the 4th century AD (based upon Earth&#x27;s calendar, approximately 1,800 years before the events of the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Awakening&quot;), apparently of radiation poisoning caused by a nuclear attack that devastates Vulcan. It&#x27;s mentioned that his death was shortly before the final battle between the Vulcans and their enemies. His spirit, or katra, is transferred into a crystalline urn which remains entombed and undisturbed until its rediscovery after two millennia by a Vulcan character, Syrran, in the 22nd century. Syrran places Surak&#x27;s katra within his own mind, which leads Syrran to create a group called Syrranites dedicated to returning Vulcan civilization to the true teachings of Surak. A decade later, in 2154 prior to the outbreak of impending Vulcan civil war, Syrran is killed while escorting the characters of Captain Jonathan Archer and T&#x27;Pol to his group&#x27;s headquarters in the Vulcan Forge. Before dying of his wounds, Syrran places Surak&#x27;s katra into Archer&#x27;s mind.

Experiencing a hallucination (or vision), Archer finds himself conversing with Surak within his own mind. Together, they witness the nuclear explosion that had occurred on Vulcan 1,800 years earlier, causing Surak&#x27;s apparent death by radiation poisoning. It is implied that those elements responsible for setting off the nuclear attack are a splinter group of Vulcans that reject Surak&#x27;s philosophy and go on to form the Romulan Empire.

A subsequent attempt to transfer Surak&#x27;s katra to Syrran&#x27;s second-in-command, T&#x27;Pau, fails when Surak chooses to remain merged with Archer. Once again conversing with Archer inside his mind and appearing radiation burned, Surak instructs him to recover an artifact called the &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot;, which Surak claims will unite the warring factions on latter-day Vulcan. It is unscripted whether Surak himself creates this artifact, or whether it is later created by other Vulcans who carry his katra. The &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; is a holographic projector of the philosopher&#x27;s original, long-lost testament—capable of restoring Vulcan society to the &quot;true path&quot; of non-violence and logic. Archer later warns his companions that the Vulcan High Command intends to attack the Andorians, having learned this from Surak who he believes discovered it from some of Syrran&#x27;s memories that got transferred over as well. Archer and T&#x27;Pau succeed in taking the artifact to the corrupt Vulcan High Command in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot;, resulting in its overthrow. Surak&#x27;s katra is subsequently transferred into the mind of an elderly Vulcan priest; what becomes of his katra afterwards in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; backstory is, as yet, unscripted.

Star Trek author Diane Duane explored Surak&#x27;s backstory from the character&#x27;s own perspective, in the novel &quot;Spock&#x27;s World&quot; – which depicts Surak&#x27;s initial awakening and dissemination of his philosophy after leaving his job as a computer programmer in response to a nuclear explosion from a war between mining conglomerates that spreads to T&#x27;Khut, Vulcan&#x27;s &quot;moon&quot; (in reality, Vulcan&#x27;s smaller binary planet). In the character&#x27;s depicted internal struggle, Surak conquers his own xenophobia, becomes &quot;awake&quot; to the horrors of war, and develops the pluralistic rationalist philosophy of IDIC (&quot;Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations&quot;) plus logic that ultimately brings peace to Vulcan.

The character names of many latter-day Vulcan males begin with &quot;S&quot; and end in &quot;k&quot;, perhaps to honor Surak, though some Vulcan character names do not fit this formula (e.g. Tuvok).

A character representing a physical re-creation of the &quot;historical Surak&quot; in his youthful maturity—fashioned by advanced alien technology from telepathically-recorded recollections and expectations held by Spock, appears in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode &quot;The Savage Curtain&quot;, and is portrayed by actor Barry Atwater. The vision of a more elderly Surak appearing in the mind of the character of Captain Jonathan Archer is portrayed by actor Bruce Gray.

The only specific mention of the character of Surak in the 24th century period of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; saga is in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;In the Cards&quot;, where the character of the Ferengi trader, Quark, hawks a bracelet &quot;from the time of Surak&quot; and in the 23rd century Prime Universe story line wherein Surak is mentioned along with predominantly historical figures in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; when the son of Adm. James T. Kirk, Dr. David Marcus, tells his mother, Dr. Carol Marcus, that her name will be mentioned along with other famous scientific individuals such as &quot;Cochran, Einstein and Surak&quot; in reference to her designing and building the Genesis Device.

==Cultural impact==
The fictional Surak&#x27;s philosophy of rationalism with emotional mastery and its role as a cornerstone of Vulcan and Starfleet mythos has contributed a distinct philosophical component to the broader cultural influence of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Similar to the anecdotal testimonies that &quot;Star Trek&quot; has inspired many of its viewers to become scientists or engineers, other viewers have adopted Starfleet- or Surak-inspired personal philosophies and lifestyles and founded fan-based (such as STARFLEET International) or &quot;IDIC plus logic&quot; philosophy-inspired &quot;pluralistic rationalist&quot; organizations.

<doc id="404088" wikidata="Q1072290" url="?curid=404088" title="Sick building syndrome">
<text>Sick building syndrome (SBS) is a condition in which people develop symptoms of illness or become infected with chronic disease from the building in which they work or reside. In scientific literature, SBS is also known as building-related illness (BRI), building-related symptoms (BRS), or idiopathic environmental intolerance (IEI).

The main identifying observation is an increased incidence of complaints of such symptoms as headache, eye, nose, and throat irritation, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. The 1989 Oxford English Dictionary defines SBS in that way. The World Health Organization created a 484-page tome on indoor air quality in 1984, when SBS was attributed only to non-organic causes, and suggested that the book might form a basis for legislation or litigation.

The outbreaks may or may not be a direct result of inadequate or inappropriate cleaning. SBS has also been used to describe staff concerns in post-war buildings with faulty building aerodynamics, construction materials, construction process, and maintenance. Some symptoms tend to increase in severity with the time people spend in the building, often improving or even disappearing when people are away from the building. The term &quot;SBS&quot; is also used interchangeably with &quot;building-related symptoms&quot;, which orients the name of the condition around patients&#x27; symptoms rather than a &quot;sick&quot; building.

Attempts have been made to connect sick building syndrome to various causes, such as contaminants produced by outgassing of some building materials, volatile organic compounds (VOC), improper exhaust ventilation of ozone (produced by the operation of some office machines), light industrial chemicals used within, and insufficient fresh-air intake or air filtration (&quot;see&quot; &quot;Minimum efficiency reporting value&quot;). Sick building syndrome has also been attributed to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, an attribution about which there are inconsistent findings.

==Signs and symptoms==

Human exposure to aerosols has a variety of adverse health effects. Building occupants complain of symptoms such as sensory irritation of the eyes, nose, or throat; neurotoxic or general health problems; skin irritation; nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions; infectious diseases; and odor and taste sensations. Poor lighting has caused general malaise.

Extrinsic allergic alveolitis has been associated with the presence of fungi and bacteria in the moist air of residential houses and commercial offices. A study in 2017 correlated several inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract with objective evidence of damp-caused damage in homes.

The WHO has classified the reported symptoms into broad categories, including mucous-membrane irritation (eye, nose, and throat irritation), neurotoxic effects (headaches, fatigue, and irritability), asthma and asthma-like symptoms (chest tightness and wheezing), skin dryness and irritation, and gastrointestinal complaints.

Several sick occupants may report individual symptoms that do not seem connected. The key to discovery is the increased incidence of illnesses in general with onset or exacerbation in a short period, usually weeks. In most cases, SBS symptoms are relieved soon after the occupants leave the particular room or zone. However, there can be lingering effects of various neurotoxins, which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building. In some cases, including those of sensitive people, there are long-term health effects.

==Cause==
ASHRAE has recognized that polluted urban air, designated within the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&#x27;s air quality ratings as unacceptable, requires the installation of treatment such as filtration for which the HVAC practitioners generally apply carbon-impregnated filters and their likes. Different toxins will aggravate the human body in different ways. Some people are more allergic to mold, while others are highly sensitive to dust. Inadequate ventilation will exaggerate small problems (such as deteriorating fiberglass insulation or cooking fumes) into a much more serious indoor air quality problem.

Common products such as paint, insulation, rigid foam, particle board, plywood, duct liners, exhaust fumes and other chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants can be trapped inside by the HVAC AC system. As this air is recycled using fan coils the overall oxygenation ratio drops and becomes harmful. When combined with other stress factors such as traffic noise and poor lighting, inhabitants of buildings located in a polluted urban area can quickly become ill as their immune system is overwhelmed.

Certain VOCs, considered toxic chemical contaminants to humans, are used as adhesives in many common building construction products. These aromatic carbon rings / VOCs can cause acute and chronic health effects in the occupants of a building, including cancer, paralysis, lung failure, and others. Bacterial spores, fungal spores, mold spores, pollen, and viruses are types of biological contaminants and can all cause allergic reactions or illness described as SBS. In addition, pollution from outdoors, such as motor vehicle exhaust, can enter buildings, worsen indoor air quality, and increase the indoor concentration of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Adult SBS symptoms were associated with a history of allergic rhinitis, eczema, and asthma.

A 2015 study concerning the association of SBS and indoor air pollutants in office buildings in Iran found that, as carbon dioxide increased in a building, nausea, headaches, nasal irritation, dyspnea, and throat dryness also rose. Some work conditions have been correlated with specific symptoms: brighter light, for example was significantly related to skin dryness, eye pain, and malaise. Higher temperature is correlated with sneezing, skin redness, itchy eyes, and headache; lower relative humidity has been associated with sneezing, skin redness, and eye pain.

In 1973, in response to the oil crisis and conservation concerns, ASHRAE Standards 62-73 and 62-81 reduced required ventilation from per person to per person, but this was found to contribute to sick building syndrome. As of the 2016 revision, ASHRAE ventilation standards call for 5 to 10 cubic feet per minute of ventilation per occupant (depending on the occupancy type) in addition to ventilation based on the zone floor area delivered to the breathing zone.

===Workplace===
Excessive work stress or dissatisfaction, poor interpersonal relationships, and poor communication are often seen to be associated with SBS, recent studies show that a combination of environmental sensitivity and stress can greatly contribute to sick building syndrome.

Greater effects were found with features of the psycho-social work environment including high job demands and low support. The report concluded that the physical environment of office buildings appears to be less important than features of the psycho-social work environment in explaining differences in the prevalence of symptoms. However, there is still a relationship between sick building syndrome and symptoms of workers regardless of workplace stress.

Specific work-related stressors are related with specific SBS symptoms. Workload and work conflict are significantly associated with general symptoms (headache, abnormal tiredness, sensation of cold, or nausea). While crowded workspaces and low work satisfaction are associated with upper respiratory symptoms. Work productivity has been associated with ventilation rates, a contributing factor to SBS, and there&#x27;s a significant increase in production as ventilation rates increase, by 1.7% for every two-fold increase of ventilation rate. Printer effluent, released into the office air as ultra-fine particles (UFPs) as toner is burned during the printing process, may lead to certain SBS symptoms. Printer effluent may contain a variety of toxins to which a subset of office workers are sensitive, triggering SBS symptoms.

Specific careers are also associated with specific SBS symptoms. Transport, communication, healthcare, and social workers have highest prevalence of general symptoms. Skin symptoms such as eczema, itching, and rashes on hands and face are associated with technical work. Forestry, agriculture, and sales workers have the lowest rates of sick building syndrome symptoms.

From the assessment done by Fisk and Mudarri, 21% of asthma cases in the United States were caused by wet environments with mold that exist in all indoor environments, such as schools, office buildings, houses, and apartments. Fisk and Berkeley Laboratory colleagues also found that the exposure to the mold increases the chances of respiratory issues by 30 to 50 percent. Additionally, studies showing that health effects with dampness and mold in indoor environments found that increased risk of adverse health effects occurs with dampness or visible mold environments.

Milton et al. determined the cost of sick leave specific for one business was an estimated $480 per employee, and about five days of sick leave per year could be attributed to low ventilation rates. When comparing low ventilation rate areas of the building to higher ventilation rate areas, the relative risk of short-term sick leave was 1.53 times greater in the low ventilation areas.

===Home===
Sick building syndrome can be caused by one&#x27;s home. Laminate flooring may release more SBS-causing chemicals than do stone, tile, and concrete floors. Recent redecorating and new furnishings within the last year are associated with increased symptoms; so are dampness and related factors, having pets, and cockroaches. Mosquitoes are related to more symptoms, but it is unclear whether the immediate cause of the symptoms is the mosquitoes or the repellents used against them.

====Mold====

Sick building syndrome may be associated with indoor mold or mycotoxin contamination. However, the attribution of sick building syndrome to mold is controversial and supported by little evidence.

===Indoor temperature===

Indoor temperature under 18 °C (64 °F) has been shown to be associated with increased respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, increased blood pressure levels, and increased hospitalization.

==Diagnosis==
While sick building syndrome (SBS) encompasses a multitude of non-specific symptoms, building-related illness (BRI) comprises specific, diagnosable symptoms caused by certain agents (chemicals, bacteria, fungi, etc.). These can typically be identified, measured, and quantified. There are usually four causal agents in BRi: immunologic, infectious, toxic, and irritant. For instance, Legionnaire&#x27;s disease, usually caused by &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, involves a specific organism which could be ascertained through clinical findings as the source of contamination within a building.

==Prevention==
* Reduction of time spent in the building
* If living in the building, moving to a new place
* Fixing any deteriorated paint or concrete deterioration
* Regular inspections to indicate for presence of mold or other toxins
* Adequate maintenance of all building mechanical systems
* Toxin-absorbing plants, such as sansevieria
* Roof shingle non-pressure cleaning for removal of algae, mold, and &quot;Gloeocapsa magma&quot;
* Using ozone to eliminate the many sources, such as VOCs, molds, mildews, bacteria, viruses, and even odors. However, numerous studies identify high-ozone shock treatment as ineffective despite commercial popularity and popular belief.
* Replacement of water-stained ceiling tiles and carpeting
* Only using paints, adhesives, solvents, and pesticides in well-ventilated areas or only using these pollutant sources during periods of non-occupancy
* Increasing the number of air changes per hour; the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers recommend a minimum of 8.4 air exchanges per 24-hour period
* Increased ventilation rates that are above the minimum guidelines
* Proper and frequent maintenance of HVAC systems
* UV-C light in the HVAC plenum
* Installation of HVAC air cleaning systems or devices to remove VOCs and bioeffluents (people odors)
* Central vacuums that completely remove all particles from the house including the ultrafine particles (UFPs) which are less than 0.1 μm
* Regular vacuuming with a HEPA filter vacuum cleaner to collect and retain 99.97% of particles down to and including 0.3 micrometers
* Placing bedding in sunshine, which is related to a study done in a high-humidity area where damp bedding was common and associated with SBS
* Lighting in the workplace should be designed to give individuals control, and be natural when possible
* Relocating office printers outside the air conditioning boundary, perhaps to another building
* Replacing current office printers with lower emission rate printers
* Identification and removal of products containing harmful ingredients

==Management==
SBS, as a non-specific blanket term, does not have any specific cause or cure. Any known cure would be associated with the specific eventual disease that was cause by exposure to known contaminants. In all cases, alleviation consists of removing the affected person from the building associated. BRI, on the other hand, utilizes treatment appropriate for the contaminant identified within the building (e.g., antibiotics for Legionnaire&#x27;s disease).

Improving the indoor air quality (IAQ) of a particular building can attenuate, or even eliminate, the continued exposure to toxins. However, a Cochrane review of 12 mold and dampness remediation studies in private homes, workplaces, and schools by two independent authors were deemed to be very low to moderate quality of evidence in reducing adult asthma symptoms and results were inconsistent among children. For the individual, the recovery may be a process involved with targeting the acute symptoms of a specific illness, as in the case of mold toxins. Treating various building-related illnesses is vital to the overall understanding of SBS. Careful analysis by certified building professionals and physicians can help to identify the exact cause of the BRI, and help to illustrate a causal path to infection. With this knowledge one can, theoretically, remediate a building of contaminants and rebuild the structure with new materials. Office BRI may more likely than not be explained by three events: &quot;Wide range in the threshold of response in any population (susceptibility), a spectrum of response to any given agent, or variability in exposure within large office buildings.&quot;

Isolating any one of the three aspects of office BRI can be a great challenge, which is why those who find themselves with BRI should take three steps, history, examinations, and interventions. History describes the action of continually monitoring and recording the health of workers experiencing BRI, as well as obtaining records of previous building alterations or related activity. Examinations go hand in hand with monitoring employee health. This step is done by physically examining the entire workspace and evaluating possible threats to health status among employees. Interventions follow accordingly based on the results of the Examination and History report.

==Epidemiology==
Some studies have found that women have higher reports of SBS symptoms than men. It is not entirely clear, however, if this is due to biological, social, or occupational factors.

A 2001 study published in the Journal Indoor Air, gathered 1464 office-working participants to increase the scientific understanding of gender differences under the Sick Building Syndrome phenomenon. Using questionnaires, ergonomic investigations, building evaluations, as well as physical, biological, and chemical variables, the investigators obtained results that compare with past studies of SBS and gender. The study team found that across most test variables, prevalence rates were different in most areas, but there was also a deep stratification of working conditions between genders as well. For example, men&#x27;s workplaces tend to be significantly larger and have all-around better job characteristics. Secondly, there was a noticeable difference in reporting rates, specifically that women have higher rates of reporting roughly 20% higher than men. This information was similar to that found in previous studies, thus indicating a potential difference in willingness to report.

There might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome, because women tend to report more symptoms than men do. Along with this, some studies have found that women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial erythema. Also, women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors because they have a greater tendency to have clerical jobs, wherein they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials (example: blueprint machines, toner-based printers), whereas men often have jobs based outside of offices.

==History==

In the late 1970s, it was noted that nonspecific symptoms were reported by tenants in newly constructed homes, offices, and nurseries. In media it was called &quot;office illness&quot;. The term &quot;sick building syndrome&quot; was coined by the WHO in 1986, when they also estimated that 10–30% of newly built office buildings in the West had indoor air problems. Early Danish and British studies reported symptoms.

Poor indoor environments attracted attention. The Swedish allergy study (SOU 1989:76) designated &quot;sick building&quot; as a cause of the allergy epidemic as was feared. In the 1990s, therefore, extensive research into &quot;sick building&quot; was carried out. Various physical and chemical factors in the buildings were examined on a broad front.

The problem was highlighted increasingly in media and was described as a &quot;ticking time bomb&quot;. Many studies were performed in individual buildings.

In the 1990s &quot;sick buildings&quot; were contrasted against &quot;healthy buildings&quot;. The chemical contents of building materials were highlighted. Many building material manufacturers were actively working to gain control of the chemical content and to replace criticized additives. The ventilation industry advocated above all more well-functioning ventilation. Others perceived ecological construction, natural materials, and simple techniques as a solution.

At the end of the 1990s came an increased distrust of the concept of &quot;sick building&quot;. A dissertation at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm 1999 questioned the methodology of previous research, and a Danish study from 2005 showed these flaws experimentally. It was suggested that sick building syndrome was not really a coherent syndrome and was not a disease to be individually diagnosed, but a collection of as many as a dozen semi-related diseases. In 2006 the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommended in the medical journal &quot;Läkartidningen&quot; that &quot;sick building syndrome&quot; should not be used as a clinical diagnosis. Thereafter, it has become increasingly less common to use terms such as &quot;sick buildings&quot; and &quot;sick building syndrome&quot; in research. However, the concept remains alive in popular culture and is used to designate the set of symptoms related to poor home or work environment engineering. &quot;Sick building&quot; is therefore an expression used especially in the context of workplace health.

Sick building syndrome made a rapid journey from media to courtroom where professional engineers and architects became named defendants and were represented by their respective professional practice insurers. Proceedings invariably relied on expert witnesses, medical and technical experts, building managers, contractors, and manufacturers of finishes and furnishings, testifying as to cause and effect. Most of these actions resulted in sealed settlement agreements, none of these being dramatic. The insurers needed a defense based upon Standards of Professional Practice to meet a court decision that declared that in a modern, essentially sealed building, the HVAC systems must produce breathing air for suitable human consumption. ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers, currently with over 50,000 international members) undertook the task of codifying its indoor air quality (IAQ) standard.

ASHRAE empirical research determined that &quot;acceptability&quot; was a function of outdoor (fresh air) ventilation rate and used carbon dioxide as an accurate measurement of occupant presence and activity. Building odors and contaminants would be suitably controlled by this dilution methodology. ASHRAE codified a level of 1,000 ppm of carbon dioxide and specified the use of widely available sense-and-control equipment to assure compliance. The 1989 issue of ASHRAE 62.1-1989 published the whys and wherefores and overrode the 1981 requirements that were aimed at a ventilation level of 5,000 ppm of carbon dioxide (the OSHA workplace limit), federally set to minimize HVAC system energy consumption. This apparently ended the SBS epidemic.

Over time, building materials changed with respect to emissions potential. Smoking vanished and dramatic improvements in ambient air quality, coupled with code compliant ventilation and maintenance, per ASHRAE standards have all contributed to the acceptability of the indoor air environment.

<doc id="404090" wikidata="Q726427" url="?curid=404090" title="Philip P. Barbour">
<text>Philip Pendleton Barbour (May 25, 1783 – February 25, 1841) was the tenth speaker of the United States House of Representatives and an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He is the only individual to serve in both positions.

Born in Gordonsville, Virginia, Barbour established a legal career in Gordonsville after studying at the College of William &amp; Mary. Several members of Barbour&#x27;s family, including his brother, James Barbour, went on to hold prominent political office. Barbour won election to the House of Representatives in 1814 as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. He served a single term as Speaker from 1821 to 1823 and declined to seek re-election to Congress in 1824. Barbour returned to Congress in 1827 as an ally of Andrew Jackson.

Barbour served in Congress until 1830, when he accepted appointment as a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. President Jackson appointed Barbour to the Supreme Court in 1835 to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation in 1835 of Gabriel Duvall. Barbour served on the Court until his death in 1841. On the Court, Barbour generally supported Jacksonian principles and states&#x27; rights.

==Early and family life==
Barbour was born near Gordonsville, Orange County, Virginia, as the son of a planter, Thomas Barbour, who was a legislator, neighbor and early political sponsor of James Madison. He was named for his ancestor Philip Pendleton, through whom he was related to Edmund Pendleton, a politician and judge. The family was one of the First Families of Virginia, descended from a Scottish merchant who married a Miss Taliaferro and made his home in nearby Culpeper County, Virginia.

Like his brother James Barbour, Philip attended common and private schools before beginning formal legal studies under jurist St. George Tucker in Williamsburg, Virginia, but financial circumstances forced Tucker to end this arrangement in 1799.

He soon moved to Kentucky to make his fortune, where after a year reading law, he was admitted to the bar, and began practicing law in Bardstown. After another year, friends persuaded him to return to Virginia and resume his studies at the College of William &amp; Mary, so in 1802, he began practicing law near his family home in Gordonsville.

In 1804, Barbour married a local planter&#x27;s daughter, Frances Johnson, with whom he had one son named Sextus Barbour. Barbour was a slave owner.

== Political and early judicial career ==
Barbour practiced law for eight years before he started his public life as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1812 to 1814. When U.S. Representative John Dawson died, Barbour won the special election to fill the seat, and served as a Jeffersonian Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives from September 19, 1814 to March 4, 1825, reaching the office of Speaker from 1821 to 1823. Barbour entered politics as the nation witnessed a political shift in which former state&#x27;s rights activists such as current President James Madison, Henry Clay, and his brother James, now a U.S. Senator, began supporting nationalistic policies. Throughout this shift in power, Philip Barbour remained a strong advocate of Jeffersonian &quot;Old Republican&quot; principles of states&#x27; rights and maintaining a strict construction of the Constitution.

=== First term in Congress ===
Barbour&#x27;s reputation for constitutional conservatism grew with his opposition to the Bonus Bill of 1817. The Bill permitted the federal funding of internal
improvement projects such as building roads like that being constructed to connect Buffalo, New York to New Orleans, Louisiana, through Washington. Barbour viewed federally funded internal projects as outside the sphere of Congress&#x27; powers and therefore unconstitutional and undermining state sovereignty. Barbour viewed states as sovereign, political communities, independent of an overarching political dynasty and free to secede from the Union if the federal government infringed on the rights of the states, an argument that he employed when countering restrictions to Missouri&#x27;s admission to the Union as a slave state.

Barbour also defended Missouri&#x27;s ban on free Black Americans entering the state. To those who argued that this ban was a violation of Article IV of the Constitution, he replied that banning free Black Americans was no different than banning destitute white men who would become a burden on the state. He argued that the term &quot;citizen&quot; did not apply to Black Americans, whether free or not.

His opposition to national restrictions on slave states served to foment his passion for states&#x27; rights but also develop his pro-slavery argument in politics. As a Congressman, Barbour was the first prominent politician to openly contest the constitutionality of protective tariffs.

==== &quot;Cohens v. Virginia&quot; ====
In &quot;Cohens v. Virginia&quot; (1821), Congressman Barbour represented the Commonwealth of Virginia to argue the issue of the Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisdiction to hear the case, in which two men from Baltimore were convicted for selling D.C. lottery tickets in Virginia. Barbour unsuccessfully argued that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction, since the law banning the sale of foreign lottery tickets was not meant to affect Virginia, rendering this a purely local issue. He also maintained that the suit was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, which prohibits suit against a state without its consent. However, Chief Justice Marshall held that the Court had jurisdiction based on the Supremacy Clause, Art. VI, cl. 2. This case strengthened Barbour&#x27;s reputation as an Old Republican leader in a political system in which Virginian influence was waning and power was shifting between parties with the election of Andrew Jackson as the seventh President of the United States.

==== Jacksonian Democratic-Republican Party ====
Andrew Jackson&#x27;s election in 1828 led to the bifurcation of the Old Republican Party into the Jacksonian Democratic Republicans and the opposing National Republicans. Jackson formed the Democratic party on the foundation of Old Republican principles, such as Jefferson&#x27;s displeasure with Hamilton&#x27;s National Bank. During his two terms, President Jackson destroyed the Second Bank of the United States, and advocated for individual liberty, states&#x27; rights, and slavery.

=== State judge and second term in Congress ===
Barbour declined to run for re-election in 1824 and turned down an offer from Thomas Jefferson to become the professor of law at the University of Virginia in 1825. Instead, he accepted election by Virginia legislature as a judge of the General Court of Virginia succeeding the late Hugh Holmes. Barbour served for two years as a state judge.

In 1827, Barbour returned to his seat in the House of Representatives as a Jacksonian. For the first two years of his second stint in the House, he was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

In 1829, Barbour became one of the first Jeffersonian Old Republicans to join the Jacksonian Democrats in opposition to the National Bank. He fought to expose the Second Bank of the United States as a private enterprise, endowed with federal funds while only masquerading as a government institution. Although his anti-Bank campaign did not take hold, Barbour&#x27;s advocacy for state sovereignty, the removal of the National Bank, and the legalization of slavery in territories such as Missouri earned him favor with President Andrew Jackson.

Also in 1829, while continuing to serve as a U.S. Representative, Barbour became a delegate for the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830, and the Convention elected him their second president, after the Convention&#x27;s first president, James Monroe, had to withdraw due to failing health on December 8. As such, Barbour (with distinguished Virginians such as Monroe, James Madison, and John Marshall) helped restrict discussion of slavery&#x27;s role in the Commonwealth, and limited the rancorous assembly&#x27;s debates to issues of representation and suffrage (Virginia had been one of the last states to allow only landowners to vote, and slaveholders had disproportionate power). The resulting constitution was adopted in 1830, despite the votes against it from the state&#x27;s northern and western areas (much of which ultimately split off to become West Virginia during the American Civil War decades after Barbour&#x27;s death).

=== Federal district judge and the 1832 campaign season ===
Barbour also turned down offers of a chancellorship and the post of U.S. Attorney General before finally resigning his congressional seat October 15, 1830 to accept President Jackson&#x27;s appointment to become judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Jackson appointed Barbour by recess appointment on October 8, 1830, to a seat on that court vacated by George Hay. Barbour was formally nominated on December 14, 1830, and two days later he was confirmed by the Senate, and received his commission, serving thereafter until March 17, 1836.

In 1832, Democrats unhappy with the selection of Martin Van Buren as their party&#x27;s vice-presidential nominee held a convention in Virginia, at which they nominated Jackson for president and Barbour for vice president. Barbour eventually withdrew his candidacy and endorsed the Jackson-Van Buren ticket, but the alternative Democratic ticket still appeared on the ballot in several Southern states.
Barbour also refused nominations for judge of the court of appeals, for Governor, and for United States Senator.

Although it was unknown whether Barbour could gain favor with voters outside Virginia, Barbour&#x27;s campaigning on the Democratic ticket illuminated the similarities in parties and gained favor for the Democratic party. Voters reasoned that, if a man like Barbour, loyal to his party even when his fellow Virginians chose different principles, could switch to the Democratic party, then the Democrats must hold the same values. By joining the Jacksonian Democratic Party, Barbour entrenched Old Republican principles into a new political dynasty, therefore continuing the legacy of Jefferson and further validating the strength of Democratic principles. This was similar to Lincoln&#x27;s argument that secession should not occur due to the state of perpetual Union that had existed since the first draft of the Constitution before the term &quot;Union&quot; was first used to describe the North during the Civil War. Therefore, Barbour&#x27;s resignation allowed the second party system to coalesce by unifying the Democratic Party on the ideologies of war in the American system through the national reform retrenchment and economy, and a restoration of republican constitutionalism.

== United States Supreme Court ==
=== Appointment ===
In 1835, Chief Justice Marshall&#x27;s death and Justice Gabriel Duvall&#x27;s resignation created two vacancies on the Supreme Court. President Jackson, at the end of his second Presidential term, nominated Judge Barbour to fill Duvall&#x27;s vacancy. Nationalists feared Jackson&#x27;s appointment of Barbour because Barbour&#x27;s anti-administration Congressional legacy and Democratic beliefs suggested that he would attempt to undermine the federal supremacy achieved during the Marshall Court. This fear made the finalization of the decision an arduous process with two attempts at delaying the Senate&#x27;s decision. On March 15, 1836, the Senate approved the appointment of Barbour by a vote of 30-11.

=== Tenure ===
Barbour served on the Supreme Court for five years. He heard 155 cases, for which he authored one major opinion and two dissents. His passion for states&#x27; rights, strict constructionism, and limits on federal power helped shape the legacy of the Taney Court.

During Barbour&#x27;s first term (1837), he heard three cases that mitigated Marshall&#x27;s accomplishment of judicial nationalism, &quot;Briscoe v. Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge,&quot; and &quot;New York v. Miln&quot;. Justice Barbour authored the majority opinion in &quot;New York v. Miln&quot;. In 1824, the state of New York passed a law that required all ship masters to provide a report delineating personal information of passengers in order to prevent smuggling and immigration of the impoverished for whom the state could not provide. Ship master Miln refused to comply with the law and was therefore jailed and fined. The case went to the Court on the issue of whether the statute violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., Art. 1, § 8. Barbour held that the New York statute did not violate the Commerce Clause, because it was an exercise of the power granted to the state to &quot;regulate their internal police and to take care that no detriment comes to the commonwealth.&quot; People were &quot;not the subject of commerce, and not being imported goods, cannot fall within a train of reasoning founded upon the construction of a power given to Congress to regulate commerce and the prohibition to the states from imposing a duty on imported goods.&quot; Justice Barbour argued that the statute was valid as an act of police power to protect the health and welfare of the community. Because it is within the powers of the state to have jurisdiction over its people and things within its territorial boundaries, then &quot;the authority of a state is complete, unqualified, and exclusive.&quot;

Justice Barbour&#x27;s holding in &quot;Miln&quot; was supported by Taney&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Charles River Bridge&quot; that the people have rights and it is the duty of both the state and the nation to preserve those rights in order to ensure the happiness and welfare of every citizen. &quot;Miln&quot; helped Barbour develop a states&#x27; rights constitutional vision for the Supreme Court, by narrowing the scope of federal commerce power while expanding state policing power. For both &quot;Briscoe v. Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky&quot; and &quot;Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge&quot;, Barbour voted with the majority, simultaneously gaining more power for states and weakening Marshall Court nationalism.

While Barbour did not spend enough time on the court to amass a large body of judicial opinions, he authored dissents in &quot;Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes&quot; (1838) and &quot;Holmes v. Jennison&quot; (1840). These two dissents sought to diminish federal authority by supporting Jacksonian political aspirations and opposing restrictions to state sovereignty. &quot;Kendall&quot; dealt with judicial supervision of executive acts. In 1835, President Jackson appointed Amos Kendall the Postmaster General for the United States. A firm, Stockton and Stokes, had had a contract with the previous Postmaster General, and demanded payment of outstanding debts thereunder, which Kendall declined, in favor of the debt-ridden U.S. Postal Service&#x27;s other creditors.

The Court viewed &quot;Kendall&quot; as a proceeding against an Executive Branch official who acted within the scope of his powers. The Court dealt with the issues of whether it had jurisdiction to hear the case under Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and whether it had the power to issue a writ of mandamus under Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 to an official of the Executive Branch. The majority held that the Supreme Court could issue a writ of mandamus to &quot;compel the Postmaster General to perform any ministerial duty devolved on him by law.&quot; This issue and holding is similar to that in &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; (1803), which also involved writs of mandamus to an executive officer and held that the Supremacy Clause in Article VI and the notion of popular sovereignty granted the Court jurisdiction over state court cases and the power of judicial review to make legitimate and final rulings on constitutional questions.

Justices Taney and Catron concurred with Barbour&#x27;s opinion that it was never within the scope of judicial power to control executive actions. Although Barbour believed that &quot;Congress has the constitutional power to give to the federal judiciary …authority to issue the writ of mandamus,&quot; Barbour did not believe that the lower court had the &quot;power to issue the writ in question&quot;. Even though the Postmaster General was subject to direction and control of the President with respect of the duties imposed by law, when the law is &#x27;ministerial,&#x27; Congress can limit and regulate the executive officials. Because Congress created the executive office, then Congress could monitor executive decisions, but the President is not controlled by the federal courts. While the majority opinion served to further define separation of powers by holding acts of the executive branch as subject to the rulings of the Supreme Court, Barbour&#x27;s dissenting opinion sought to discourage judicial supervision of executive acts by applying President Jackson&#x27;s departmental theory, the notion that the executive branch has the right to interpret the Constitution for itself. Barbour&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Kendall&quot; demonstrated his loyalty to President Jackson&#x27;s political agenda.

Barbour made his most powerful argument in favor of states&#x27; rights in &quot;Holmes v. Jennison&quot; (1840), which focused on the extradition of a fugitive from Vermont to Canada. In 1838, George Holmes, a resident of Quebec, was convicted of murdering Louis Paschal Achille Tache in Canada. Holmes escaped to the United States where he was detained under issue of warrant in Vermont. Silas H. Jennison, the governor of Vermont, issued the warrant stating that Holmes, being a citizen of the lower province of Canada, would be arrested and returned to suffer prosecution according to the Canadian justice system, even though the United States had no extradition treaty with Canada. Because the Vermont Supreme Court refused to issue a writ of habeas corpus, Holmes petitioned to the Supreme Court on grounds that he was unlawfully imprisoned and deprived of his personal liberties.

The case became a contentious debate further polarizing the Court between nationalists and states&#x27; rights Justices. &quot;Holmes&quot; focused on whether the Court had the authority to review the case based on Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and whether the governor&#x27;s warrant violated the Extradition Clause of Article IV, section 2 of the Constitution, which gave the federal government power to surrender a fugitive to a foreign government. Chief Justice Taney believed that the case fell within the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction and that the federal government had the exclusive power to engage in foreign relations and so believed that the governor had violated the Extradition Clause.

However, as the Court divided 4-4 over the issue of jurisdiction, the Court dismissed the petition. The Vermont Supreme Court subsequently ordered Holmes released in light of the fact that five of the eight Justices expressed the opinion that the governor had violated the Extradition Clause, an expression of the principle that the Constitution gives state officers no power to take independent actions concerned with foreign governments. Barbour was one of the four Justices who disagreed with the Chief Justice. Barbour believed that, because &quot;there is no treaty on the subject of surrendering fugitives,&quot; between Vermont and Canada, then the returning of fugitives to Canada did not violate a power granted to the federal government by the Constitution, and therefore the &quot;authority, exercised by the Governor of Vermont, is not repugnant to the power of making treaties in its dormant state, because, in the language of the Chief Justice before cited, it is not the mere existence of the power but its exercise which is incompatible with the exercise of the same power by the states.&quot; Barbour opined that, because the Constitution did not explicitly define the affairs of states with foreign countries, Governor Jennison was completely within his rights to order the extradition.

Barbour&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Holmes&quot; accorded with his opinion in &quot;New York v. Miln&quot; that the state has the duty to maintain the welfare of its people. &quot;Holmes v. Jennison&quot; provides an example of Barbour&#x27;s strict reading of the Constitution, which allowed him to read a more pronounced states&#x27; rights view into the text.

== Death and legacy ==

Barbour died of a coronary thrombosis on February 25, 1841, while asleep in his bed, and partway through the arguments of John Quincy Adams, who sought freedom for African captives in the Amistad Case. Justice Story (although opposing slavery and personally more nationalist than Barbour) eulogized Barbour as earning the respect of his colleagues by his commitment to personal values, persistence in fighting for his beliefs, and legal acumen.

Barbour owned fifty-four slaves at the time of the 1840 census.

An Episcopalian throughout his life, Philip Pendleton Barbour was buried in the Congressional Cemetery, Washington, D.C. Barbour&#x27;s long-time friend and fellow Virginian, Peter V. Daniel, succeeded him on the U.S. Supreme Court, and continued Barbour&#x27;s legacy of maintaining Jacksonian principles, states&#x27; rights, and strict constructionist reading of the Constitution.

Locations named after him include Barbour County, West Virginia, Philippi, West Virginia and its Philip Barbour High School.

Barbour&#x27;s tenure on the Court demonstrated his loyalty to President Jackson&#x27;s national vision while applying a narrowed reading of state&#x27;s rights into the Constitution. Barbour&#x27;s decisions in major Court cases created an enduring Jacksonian legacy on the Taney Court. Barbour&#x27;s furtherance of Jacksonian principles of departmental theory in his &quot;Kendall&quot; dissent, his states&#x27; rights advocacy in his majority opinion in &quot;New York v. Miln&quot;, and textualist reading of the Constitution in order to distinguish state from Congressional power in his dissent in &quot;Holmes&quot;, all served in this regard.

Barbour&#x27;s opinions began to unravel the work of Marshall&#x27;s Court, and set a precedent for future cases as the country became more polarized. Barbour&#x27;s arguments for the authority of the President to interpret the Constitution in &quot;Kendall&quot;, and those in defense of the states&#x27; police power in &quot;Cohens v. Virginia&quot;, allowed Chief Justice Taney to rule that slaves were not citizens in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sanford&quot; (1857). Ironically, they were also used by President Abraham Lincoln to issue a suspension of habeas corpus in 1861.

<doc id="404100" wikidata="Q607452" url="?curid=404100" title="Saavik">
<text>Saavik is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. She first appeared in the film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982) played by Kirstie Alley. Robin Curtis took over the role for &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984) and &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986).

== Fictional biography ==
Saavik&#x27;s background was never explored on screen. It has, however, been fleshed out in novels and comic books, though none of these sources are considered canon. According to the novels and comics, Saavik was born on Hellguard, an abandoned Romulan colony, and is half Vulcan and half Romulan. 

A line of dialogue that would have revealed this in &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; was edited out prior to the film&#x27;s release and never restored; as a result, the canonicity of this piece of information has been debated for more than two decades. Saavik&#x27;s mixed parentage is referenced often in her appearances in &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels. However, if Saavik&#x27;s mixed ancestry were to be made canon, it would violate the continuity created by the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot; (which takes place after Saavik&#x27;s birth) in which Starfleet learns for the first time that Romulans resemble Vulcans, a fact that appears to be unknown to Vulcans (or at least the extremely knowledgeable Mr. Spock) as well. 

Some non-canon novels, however, hold that at least some Vulcans were fully aware of the Romulans&#x27; heritage, but deliberately concealed that knowledge from the Federation, considering it an embarrassing internal affair that should not be revealed to their allies. The TV series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; established in canon that some factions of the Vulcan government were aware of the connection as early as the 22nd century. (There has also been some debate about whether Spock rescued the child Saavik before or after the events that occurred during &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;. A rescue occurring after the episode would not be in conflict with the Vulcans&#x27; knowledge of Romulans.)

A few sources have her (non-canon) origin story aligned to original material found in the film&#x27;s novelization, as follows: she was rescued from the colony, along with other children, by Spock, and she was cared for by his parents Ambassador Sarek and Amanda Grayson. Following in the footsteps of her mentor, Spock, she entered Starfleet Academy. 

In the non-canon 1990 novel &quot;The Pandora Principle,&quot; written by Carolyn Clowes, it is established that four Vulcan research ships were captured by Romulans. Their Vulcan crews were abducted by Romulan scientists and their fertility was manipulated to produce half-Romulan, half-Vulcan children such as Saavik to use in mind control experiments. Vulcan scientists learned of the experiments and mounted a secret rescue of Saavik and other child survivors on Hellguard. Spock threatened to reveal the story to Federation authorities and along with it the secret of the Vulcan mating cycle &quot;pon farr&quot; if the survivors were denied Vulcan citizenship. Other members of the party wanted to educate them elsewhere and send the children to live on worlds other than Vulcan. Clowes writes that Saavik&#x27;s name is of Romulan origin and translates as &quot;little cat&quot;. In &quot;The Pandora Principle,&quot; Saavik, unlike the other half-Vulcan, half-Romulan child survivors, refuses a DNA test that would identify her Vulcan relatives. Instead, Spock, who has established a bond with her, takes a year of personal leave to &quot;civilize&quot; and educate the 9- or 10-year-old Saavik. She then lives off Vulcan with foster families or at boarding schools chosen by Spock until she is accepted into the Starfleet Academy as a teenager. This agrees with the &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; novelization which said Saavik has never been to Vulcan until then. After graduating, as a fresh Lieutenant Saavik was on her cadet cruise on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; with Admiral James T. Kirk and Captain Spock when Kirk&#x27;s old enemy Khan Noonien Singh sought revenge for the failure of the Ceti Alpha V colony and the death of his wife, Marla McGivers, and attacked the &quot;Enterprise.&quot;

Spock died while saving the &quot;Enterprise&quot; during the events of &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot;, but before his death transferred his &quot;katra&quot; to Dr. Leonard McCoy. His coffin was fired from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in orbit around the Genesis Planet and was believed to have been destroyed in the atmosphere. A rare expression of emotion by a Vulcan is displayed when Saavik is seen shedding a tear during the eulogy for Spock by Kirk. Saavik and David Marcus (son of Admiral James T. Kirk), subsequently were assigned to the research vessel &quot;USS Grissom&quot; to study the newly formed Genesis Planet. During this mission, Saavik discovered that Spock had somehow been regenerated, and was rapidly aging. As the new Spock entered his teenage years, he began experiencing the mating drive known as &quot;pon farr&quot;, and Saavik helped Spock through this difficult time. When the Klingon commander Kruge and his men captured the landing party the next day, David sacrificed his life to save Saavik from being executed. Saavik helped Admiral Kirk return Spock to Vulcan, where his body and &quot;katra&quot; were reunited. Afterwards, she remained on Vulcan with Spock&#x27;s family for reasons never explained on screen; the film&#x27;s writers intended that this was because she was pregnant with Spock&#x27;s child as a result of the &quot;pon farr&quot;, but no references to her pregnancy made it into the finished movie and it was initially not followed up, thereby once again placing this development into a grey area in terms of canon. Before the Enterprise crew departed Vulcan, Saavik told Captain Kirk how his son had died bravely, sacrificing himself to save both Spock and herself. In the 2024 short film 765874 – Unification Saavik is shown wordlessly introducing Kirk to a grown Vulcan looking male (played by Mark Chinnery and named Sorak in the credits) indicating he was her son.

== Unrealized concepts ==

Saavik was at one point to appear in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode, &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; in a scene in which the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D encounters a starship that had been trapped in a time anomaly for some 80 years. The idea was dropped when Kirstie Alley insisted on being paid more for a nonspeaking cameo part than the episode budget could supply. (Saavik was to have been shown standing alongside a character played by Kelsey Grammer, Alley&#x27;s &quot;Cheers&quot; co-star.)

The character of Saavik was originally intended to appear in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, which would have revealed her as a traitor to the Federation. The idea of using an established character was dropped and instead a new character, Valeris, was created, whom Douglas Brode described as &quot;a dark doppelgänger of the heroic Saavik&quot;. According to director Nicholas Meyer, writing in his autobiography, &quot;The View from the Bridge&quot;, Saavik was dropped from the film and Valeris created when Kirstie Alley proved unwilling to reprise the role and Meyer didn&#x27;t like Curtis&#x27;s portrayal of the character, while Leonard Nimoy, in his autobiography &quot;I Am Spock&quot;, said there were also second thoughts about casting a popular, established character as a villain. Saavik, however, does appear in the novelization of the film, as a recruiting officer who inspires Valeris to join Starfleet, and offers some insights on how to deal with a dual heritage.

== Other appearances and &quot;Next Generation&quot; continuity ==
In the novel &quot;Vulcan&#x27;s Heart&quot;, which takes place some years after &quot;Undiscovered Country&quot;, an older Saavik marries Spock. Saavik appears again in the &quot;Vulcan&#x27;s Soul&quot; trilogy of novels published from 2004. In this continuity, the character has risen to the rank of captain. In the &quot;Titan&quot; novel, &quot;Taking Wing&quot;, it is clearly stated that Spock and Saavik are married, as she sends greetings through Tuvok. Star Trek books are not considered part of the established canon.

In the &quot;Mirror Universe Saga&quot; trilogy of novels written by William Shatner, it is revealed that the Mirror Universe&#x27;s Intendant Spock had a daughter named T&#x27;Val with Mirror Saavik.

Kirstie Alley did play Saavik one other time, in a play that was set between &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;The Search for Spock&quot;, &quot;The Machiavellian Principle&quot; written by Walter Koenig for the ambitious &quot;Ultimate Fantasy&quot; convention. It also starred James Doohan, Mark Lenard (not as Sarek), Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols and George Takei, with a walk-on role by William Shatner as &quot;the Admiral&quot;. The short script was eventually published by Creation Conventions in a booklet about Koenig&#x27;s career, called &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;. It misspells the name in the cast list as &quot;Savik&quot;.

== Early reference ==
Samuel A. Peeples&#x27; unused script, &quot;Worlds That Never Were&quot;, for the second &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, had a male character called &quot;Doctor Savik&quot;, who eventually was morphed into the female Lieutenant Saavik.

== Reception ==
Her character has been discussed by a number of scholars in the context of changing the representation of women characters in the Star Trek franchise. Mary Ann Tetreault noted how her story has marked the change in the style of how females are portrayed in Star Trek, noting that &quot;she is not conventionally pretty&quot;, nor is she &quot;subordinate to the men in the story&quot;, and that she &quot;is shown to be much more capable&quot; than many of them. Anne Cranny-Francis, discussing her character&#x27;s background as revealed in a 1990 novel, &quot;The Pandora Principle&quot;, by Carolyn Clowes, described her as one of the &quot;strong and courageous&quot; women in early Star Trek stories. Likewise, Gary Westfahl called her &quot;a strong and independent character&quot;, also noting that Saavik&#x27;s character was &quot;effectively destroyed when the producers refused to meet Alley&#x27;s salary demands and recast the role in the next two films with a spectacularly untalented and vacuous actress, Robyn Curtis, transforming Saavik from a woman warrior to a wallflower&quot;. Sociologist Bärbel Schomers similarly characterized Saavik as an important character and strong female role, and listed her among several such figures that were conspicuously removed from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise shortly after their introduction.

Donald E. Palumbo stated that the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies closely conform to the structure of the monomyth as described by Joseph Campbell. In this view, Saavik provides the &quot;supernatural aid&quot; to Kirk in &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;. She is also the &quot;navigator&quot; in this and the following two films. In &quot;The Search for Spock&quot;, &quot;the reborn Spock appears to have at least a mystical marriage on Genesis with Saavik&quot;, who here takes the role of &quot;the goddess as ’good mother’ who helps him survive &quot;pon farr&quot;&quot;.

<text>[[Sayyid]] Ata&#x27;ollah Mohajerani (, also Romanized as Atā&#x27;ollāh Mohājerāni; born 24 July 1954) is an Iranian journalist, author, and reformist politician. Mohajerani served as Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance of Iran under President Mohammad Khatami from 1997 until 2000 when he was fired from office for alleged &quot;permissiveness&quot;. He is living as a UK citizen.

==Education==
Mohajerani received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from University of Isfahan, his master&#x27;s degree in history and Iranian culture from Shiraz University and his PhD in history from Tarbiat Modares University.

==Career==

Mohajerani&#x27;s political career began in 1980 after the Iranian Revolution, when he won the first round of the parliamentary elections to become a representative of Shiraz and the youngest member of the majlis. Later, he became the Parliamentary Deputy to the Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi, when he started to write the weekly column &quot;Naghd-e Haal&quot; in the Ettela&#x27;at newspaper, and then Vice President of Parliamentary Affairs under Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

As minister of culture and Islamic guidance, he officially announced and pursued a policy of &quot;leniency&quot; () towards the field of culture and arts and removed many restrictions. He earned the wrath of conservatives by allowing hundreds of new publications to start up, the release of fifty-some Persian pop music albums, and the screening of the controversial movie Two Women.

He survived impeachment by the 5th Majlis which was dominated by the conservatives in part with a &quot;daring&quot; speech defending the principle of freedom of speech in Islamic rather than Western terms.

In April 2000, however, he resigned due to heavy criticisms by the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, because of his &quot;liberal&quot; policies. He also served as the speaker of the cabinet during that time. He later became the president of the Iranian International Centre for Dialogue among Civilizations, but resigned from the post.

He was a member and a founder of Executives of Construction Party, which is considered a backer of Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

Mohajerani participated in the funeral and burial of former revolutionary Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, when few Iranian officials dared doing so because of Bazargan&#x27;s very unpopular status among the higher ranks of the Islamic Republic government.

===Works===
Of the books Mohajerani has written, most famous are a &quot;learned critique&quot; of the Salman Rushdie novel &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;, a book in support of Ferdowsi (and against attacks by Ahmad Shamlou), and a book on Zaynab bint Ali&#x27;s role in and after Aashurah. 
His other publications/works include:
* &quot;Gray heaven/paradise&quot;, 2007.
* 

==Personal life==
Mohajerani is married to Jamileh Kadivar, who is also a reformist politician and a former member of parliament.

Mohajerani left Iran and as of 2009 lives in England with his wife. They launched a website called &quot;www.maktoub.ir&quot;. 
Mohajerani is &quot;a vocal supporter of the pro-democracy Green Movement,&quot; and opposes violence against the Iranian government saying &quot;If we answer violence with violence, we are no different from them.&quot;

== Advocating Khomeini&#x27;s order to kill British author==
After Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Salman Rushdie because of his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, Mohajerani published a book called &quot;Critique of the Satanic Verses Conspiracy&quot; in 1989. Mohajarani quoted Khomeini&#x27;s fatwa at the beginning of his book and approved and justified the fatwa.
In 1995, Mohajerani wrote a short story gleefully satirising this British writer&#x27;s fear of being attacked. Responding to Khomeini&#x27;s Fatwa, on July 2, 1993, unknown assailants set fire to a hotel in the Turkish city of Sivas that was hosting a speech by Aziz Nesin, a renowned humorist who had translated the book into Turkish. A total of 35 people plus two perpetrators were killed in the blaze, and 145 people were injured. Mohajirani insisted that the massacre was a proud moment in what he called the glorious Islamic reawakening and wrote that Khomeini&#x27;s fatwa had worked like a vaccine preventing further criticism of the prophet of Islam. So far, no proper study has been conducted into the role of Mohajerani and his book in promoting this massacre of intellectuals, translators and publishers worldwide.

In January 2023, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the Metropolitan Police was reviewing a legal dossier filed in August 2022 that accused Mohajerani of encouraging terrorism contrary to the Terrorism Act 2006.

<text>Seyed Mohammad-Ali Abtahi (; born January 28, 1960, in Mashhad) is an Iranian theologian, scholar, pro-democracy activist and chairman of the Institute for Interreligious Dialogue. During the 1980s, he worked as the head of IRIB broadcasting in Mashhad, Bushehr, and Shiraz, and between 2001 and 2004 he worked as the vice-president for legal affairs in Majlis (Islamic Parliament of Iran) and was the advisor to the president between 2004 and 2005.

He also took the position of the head of the president&#x27;s office at the time of the 7th government ( Seyed Mohammad Khatami). He served as the deputy for legal affairs for the Islamic Consultative Assembly between 2001 and 2004.

== Biography ==

He has three brothers, Mohammad Taghi, Hossein, and Reza and two sisters, Hourieh and Narges.

== Positions in the Islamic Republic ==
Due to his background in supporting the Islamic Revolution, and his amateur activities in arts and culture before the Islamic Revolution in 1979, he was elected as the director of Mashhad Broadcasting programs. After a two-year-old residence in Qom dedicated to his studies, he became the chief executive director of Boushehr and Shiraz Broadcasting. Abtahi was transferred to Tehran in 1983 and was assigned as Radio Iran&#x27;s director. He remained in the same position until 1988, when he became the deputy of IRIB Broadcasting overseas department, and while Mohammad Reza Khatami was the minister of Islamic Guidance, Abtahi became the deputy of the international affairs of this ministry, responsible for community centers (Khane-ye-Farhang) and cultural discussions all over the world. After Mohammad Reza Khatami resignation in 1992, he resigned as well and returned to IRIB Broadcasting as the adviser to the president (Mohammad Hashemi Rafsanjani) consultant.

In the 10th election, unlike Khatami who supported MirHossein Mousavi, he joined Karroubi’s campaign and was arrested on June 16, 2009. Following the post-election struggles, he was arrested together with several other reformists. He was arrested by the order of Saeed Mortazavi issued before the election. His wife states (regarding his arrest):I met my husband 43 days after he had been arrested, while he had lost about 43 kilos. and said they had been giving him a tablet during the last few days which had calmed him down against all the excitements of the world.
Though Abtahi denied receiving any tablets in an interview broadcast on August 2, in Bist-o-Si, he attended the first trial session of suspects in the meeting hall of the Tehran General Department of Justice. A few years after he was released, he had an interview with Hossein Dehbashi in Khesht-e-Kham in which Abtahi explained his reasons for what he had said on the trial session.

=== Statements on the Trial Session ===
On August 1, 2009, in a court presided over by Judge Salavati and without the presence of independent journalists, the jury, the defendants&#x27; lawyer (Saleh Nikbakht) and the defendants&#x27; family.

Only the reporters of IRIB new Agency, IRNA and Fars News were present at the court. Also, the camera team of Press TV was not allowed to take pictures. Abtahi was trialed along with 100 other people.

He appeared in a news conference together with Mohammad Atrianfar and considered Mirhossein Mousavi to be under the illusion of fraud and called Seyyed Mohammad Khatami&#x27;s association with Mousavi treacherous. He also accused Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of taking revenge on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Seyedali Khamenei.

The Secretariat of Expediency Discernment Council issued a statement rejecting the remarks of Abtahi, calling them completely false, claiming the uncertainty of the conditions and considerations under which these remarks were made.

On November 21, 2009, Abtahi was sentenced to six years of penal servitude, and on November 22, 2009, he was released from prison after 160 days on bail.


After his release, Zahra Rahnoord, Mirhossein Mousavi, Seyed Mohammad Khatami, Mehdi Karroubi and Hassan Khomeini visited him at his home.

=== The assault and attack ===
On June 20, 2010, after a memorial for Mirza Javad Tehrani, some plainclothesmen attacked him and beat him severely.“I passed there and turned into the side boulevard; I was chased by some motorcycle riders when suddenly the driver of a Pride took his colt out and blocked my way. First, they kicked my car widely in a way that even the side mirror of the car was smashed. Then one of the cycle riders took a knife out of his shirt and as he was approaching me, he shouted “get out of the car” several times. He hit the car with his knife and at the same time, another cycle rider approached me with a thick cable in his hand, and hit the rear window so severely that the whole glass was smashed, making a loud sound. Suddenly I noticed another man who had entered my car through the broken window and when I tried to push him out, he sprayed tear gas directly into my eyes. My clothes were completely covered with pieces of broken glass, and I could see nothing due to the tear gas; yet, I tried to get out of the car and could pass from the side of their car. At the same time as they were still busy, I tried my best to get away from there. Then, I saw a man cycling in front of them all. He was talking on the phone and signaled them to stop. I managed to escape that catastrophic condition with that car. There were no police officers around, and they were not worried about the arrival of any police officer, either.”

=== Attending the leader&#x27;s Ramadan Breakfast Ceremony ===
On May 23, 2018, Abtahi, together with several other members of the government was invited to the leader’s Ramadan breakfast ceremony, at the leader’s Beyt after many years.

<text>The Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni), also known as the Antarctic cod, is a large, black or brown fish found in very cold (subzero) waters of the Southern Ocean near Antarctica. It is the largest fish in the Southern Ocean, feeding on shrimp and smaller fish, and preyed on by whales, orcas, and seals. It is caught for food and marketed as Chilean sea bass together with its sister species, the more northerly Patagonian toothfish (&quot;D. eliginoides&quot;). Often mistakenly called &quot;Antarctic cod&quot;, the Antarctic toothfish belongs to the notothen family (Nototheniidae), a family of fish genera that are abundant near Antarctica.

== Name and taxonomy ==
The common name &quot;toothfish&quot; refers to the two rows of teeth in the upper jaw, thought to give it a shark-like appearance.

The genus name &quot;Dissostichus&quot; is from the Greek (twofold) and &quot;stichus&quot; (line) and refers to the presence of two long lateral lines that enable the fish to sense prey. The species name, &quot;mawsoni&quot;, honors the Australian geologist Douglas Mawson who led the 1911–1914 Australasian Antarctic Expedition that explored the Antarctic coast and obtained the species&#x27; type specimen.

The Antarctic toothfish was first formally described in 1937 from the English ichthyologist John Roxborough Norman with the type locality given as off MacRobertson Land at 66°45&#x27;S, 62°03&#x27;E in Antarctica. 

==Description==
Fully grown, these fish (and their warmer-water relative, the Patagonian toothfish, &quot;D. eleginoides&quot;) can grow to more than in length and 135 kg in weight, twice as large as the next-largest Antarctic fish. Being large, and consistent with the unstructured food webs of the ocean (i.e., big fish eat little fish regardless of identity, even eating their own offspring), the Antarctic toothfish has been characterized as a voracious predator. Furthermore, by being by far the largest midwater fish in the Southern Ocean, it is thought to fill the ecological role that sharks play in other oceans. Aiding in that role, the Antarctic toothfish is one of only five notothenioid species that, as adults, are neutrally buoyant. This buoyancy is attained at 100–120 cm in length and enables them to spend time above the bottom without expending extra energy. Both bottom-dwelling and mid-water prey are, therefore, available to them. Most other notothenioid fish and the majority of all Antarctic fishes, including smaller toothfish, are confined to the bottom. Coloring is black to olive brown, sometimes lighter on the undersides, with a mottled pattern on body and fins. Small fish blend in very well among the benthic sponges and corals. The species has a broad head, an elongated body, long dorsal and anal fins, large pectoral fins, and a rudder-like caudal fin. They typically move slowly, but are capable of speed bursts that can elude predatory seals.

==Feeding ecology==
Over the continental shelf, Antarctic toothfish feed on shrimp (&quot;Nauticaris&quot; spp.) and small fish, principally another neutrally buoyant nototheniid, the Antarctic silverfish (&quot;Pleuragramma antarcticum&quot;). This loosely schooling species is also a major prey of Adélie (&quot;Pygoscelis adeliae&quot;) and emperor penguins (&quot;Aptenodytes forsteri&quot;), Weddell seals (&quot;Leptonychotes weddellii&quot;) and Antarctic minke whales (&quot;Balaenoptera bonaerensis&quot;). Therefore, competition for prey among toothfish and these other mesopredators (middle trophic level predators) could be very important. The large Antarctic toothfish are eaten by sperm whales (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;), killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;), Weddell seals, and possibly colossal squid (&quot;Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni&quot;). Toothfish that are dwelling on the bottom, particularly those caught during the summer on the continental slope, eat mainly grenadiers (Macrouridae), but also feed on other smaller fish species and skates (&quot;Raja&quot; spp.). They also feed on the colossal squid. Antarctic toothfish have been caught to depths of 2200 m, though based on commercial fishing effort, few occur that deep.

==Aging and reproduction==
Aging data indicate Antarctic toothfish are relatively fast-growing when young, but then growth slows later in life. They reach about one-third of maximum size after 5 years, and half maximum by 10 years, after which growth slows considerably. To grow fast when small is an adaptation of most predatory fish, e.g., sharks, so as not to be small for very long. The maximum age recorded so far has been 48 years. Antarctic toothfish take a long time to mature (13 years for males, 17 years for females) and once mature may not spawn every year, though the actual spawning interval is unknown. Only a few Antarctic toothfish with mature eggs have ever been caught, meaning knowledge is sparse about fecundity. They spawn sometime during winter. Large, mature, older fish have been caught among the seamounts of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, a location thus thought to be important for spawning. Smaller, subadult Antarctic toothfish tend to concentrate in shallower waters on the continental shelf, while a large portion of the older fish are found on in the continental slope. This sequestering by size and age could be another adaptation for small fish to avoid being eaten by large ones. The recruitment potential of Antarctic toothfish, a measure of both fecundity and survival to spawning age, is not known.

==Anatomy and physiology==
The Antarctic toothfish has a lightweight, partially cartilaginous skeleton, lacks a swim bladder, and has fatty deposits which act as a stored energy source, particularly during spawning. This fat also makes large toothfish neutrally buoyant. Many toothfish caught over the seamounts are very depleted of fat, and this is thought perhaps to be related to spawning and spawning migration, which are energy-demanding activities. It is not known what happens to these fat-depleted fish, including whether they reach, or how long it takes them to reach, breeding condition again; this ostensibly occurs upon returning to continental-slope waters. Antarctic toothfish have vision and lateral line systems well adapted to find prey in low light levels. Since ice covers the surface of the ocean where Antarctic toothfish occur even in summer, these sensory specializations likely evolved to enable survival in the reduced light levels found under ice and in the Antarctic winter, as well as at deep depths. Antarctic toothfish also have a very well developed sense of smell, which is why they are easily caught by baited hooks and also scavenge the remains of penguins killed by other predators.

==Cold adaptation==
The Antarctic toothfish lives in subzero degree water below latitude 60°S. It is noteworthy, like most other Antarctic notothenioids, for producing antifreeze glycoproteins, a feature not seen in its closest relative, the Patagonian toothfish, which typically inhabits slightly warmer waters. The presence of antifreeze glycoproteins allows the Antarctic toothfish (and other notothenioids) to thrive in subzero waters of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. The Antarctic toothfish&#x27;s voracious appetite also is important in coping with cold water. It is mainly caught in the Ross Sea in the austral summer, but has also been recorded from Antarctic coastal waters south of the Indian Ocean sector, in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula, and near the South Sandwich Islands.

== Fishery and associated ecosystem ==
A fishery for Antarctic toothfish, managed by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), has existed since 1997. The existence of this fishery in the Ross Sea, the area where most Antarctic toothfish are caught, is very contentious - the main argument proposed for this is the lack of accurate population parameters, such as original stock size, fecundity, and recruitment. Moreover, the main fishing grounds are presumed by some researchers to cover the area through which the entire stock of Antarctic toothfish pass. Typically, the fishing season has finished in the area by the end of February and for the remainder of the year, much of the area is covered by sea ice, providing a natural impediment to fishing. This fishery is characterised by opponents as being a challenge to manage owing to the nature of benthic longline fishing. The bycatch of other fish can also be significant, with the ratio of toothfish caught ranging from 4.5% to 17.9% and averaging 9.3% from the 1999/2000 fishing season to 2013/14 in CCAMLR Subarea 88.1 when the toothfish catch first exceeded 50 tonnes and from 2.3% to 24.5% averaging 12.4% in CCAMLR Subarea 88.2 up to the latest publicly available figure from 2013/14. The bycatch of other fish species is also regulated to a maximum amount annually by CCAMLR. CCAMLR decision rules are based on determining the catch level that will ensure that the median estimated spawning stock biomass (not total biomass) is greater than or equal to 50% of the average pre-exploitation spawning biomass after a further 35 years of fishing (i.e. 35 years from each year of assessment), with the additional condition that the probability is less than a 10% that the spawning biomass will decline below 20% of the pre-exploitation level at any time during this period. Current spawning stock biomass for Antarctic toothfish in the Ross Sea Region is estimated to be at 75% of the pre-exploitation level (95% Bayesian probability interval 71–78%), well above the 50% target reference point.

An independent study was reported to have detected the disappearance of large fish at the southern periphery of its range in the McMurdo Sound and was postulated to be consistent with this apparent loss of large fish. However, more recent work has shown this was not the case in 2014. Some studies have reported that the prevalence of fish-eating killer whales has been apparently decreasing in the southern Ross Sea, foraging efficiency of Weddell seals is decreasing, and numbers of Adélie penguins (competitors for Antarctic silverfish) have been increasing. More recent studies have confirmed visual sightings of Weddell seals and Type-C killer whales holding and consuming large toothfish in the McMurdo Sound area and raise questions over the previously assumed importance of assumed dominance of Antarctic silverfish (&quot;Pleuragramma antarcticum&quot;) in the diet of Weddell seal and Type-C killer whales. These reports highlight the importance of managing this fishery in the best interests of the ecosystem by continuing to collect information on both Antarctic toothfish life history and the interaction of that species with predators and prey. An important research programme in this regard is the annual &#x27;Shelf&#x27; survey carried out annually since 2012, which is designed to monitor the abundance of subadult Antarctic toothfish in areas where subadult-sized fish have been regularly found (e.g., in the southern Ross Sea) has been designed provide data to better estimate recruitment variability and provide an important early-warning signal of changes in toothfish recruitment. The project also is used for additional targeted data collection to better understand the lifecycle and ecosystem role of Antarctic toothfish.

Research has provided evidence for long-distance migrations of type-C killer whales between the Ross Sea and New Zealand waters, indicating a much wider range that had been postulated by a number of scientists. One adult female type-C killer whale has been seen in both New Zealand waters and McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, and a high large proportion of type-C killer whales sighted in McMurdo Sound have scars caused by cookiecutter sharks that are currently assumed to be limited to north of 50°S. At the same time as this study was occurring, Italian whale experts at Terra Nova Bay, about 360 km north of Scott Base, deployed satellite transmitters on type-C killer whales to determine the whales&#x27; movements. Their results independently verified that type-C killer whales were commuting between Scott Base and the waters off Northland.

The total catch of Antarctic toothfish in 2013–14 was 3820 tonnes; 3,320 tonnes of this were taken from the Ross Sea (FAO Statistical Divisions 88.1 and 88.2), with the remainder taken from other high seas areas within the CCAMLR convention area.

== Management ==
The ecosystem approach to fishing is encapsulated in Article II of the CAMLR Convention. The ecosystem approach uses decision rules based on both population status targets and limit reference points, and incorporates uncertainty and ecosystem status in the calculation of these targets. Different reference points to account for the needs of dependent predators in the ecosystem are used depending on the location of the species in the food web. The ecosystem fisheries management approach by CCAMLR involves use of move-on rules to protect trophic interactions, and limit direct effects of fishing on fish bycatch, seabirds, and vulnerable marine ecosystems. Annually reviewed mitigation measures such as line weighting and streamer lines minimize seabird bycatch, which have resulted in a substantial reduction in accidental seabird mortalities in the CAMLR Convention Area. The 50% (target) and 20% (limit) reference points used by the CCAMLR decision rules exceed the requirements for target and limit reference points set by almost all national and international fisheries management organizations, even for species longer lived than toothfish. A wide study of many fisheries generally indicated that most reach maximum sustainable yield at 30–35% of their pre-exploitation abundances. CCAMLR uses a more conservative reference level to allow exploitation at a level where toothfish recruitment and the ecosystem in general is not appreciably impacted. This is required by Article II of the CAMLR Convention. A common misunderstanding of the CCAMLR decision rules is an assumption that the decline in population size will follow a clear trajectory from the starting year to a point 35 years later when the stock size will reach 50% of pre-exploitation levels and an assumption that no feedback occurs during each assessment. The catch limit, though, is recalculated based on all updated or revised data at each annual or biennial assessment. This approach is used to ensure that the 50% level will be approached slowly and enables an ongoing readjustment of catch levels as knowledge improves.

=== Environment and bycatch ===
CCAMLR imposes stringent environmental protection and bycatch mitigation measures to Antarctic toothfish fisheries, including:
* Monitoring of daytime setting and movement of vessels from the fishery should any vessel catch more than three seabirds
* Use of streamer lines during setting to keep birds away from baited hooks
* Weighting of lines to ensure fast sink rates to prevent seabirds from accessing baited hooks 
* The use of bird exclusion devices to prevent birds from accessing hooks whilst lines are being hauled
* Limitations on the release of fish offal overboard at the same time as setting and hauling of lines to avoid attracting seabirds: An additional requirement prohibits the dumping of all offal south of 60°S, the region where Antarctic toothfish are caught
* Prohibition on the dumping of oil, plastic, garbage, food waste, poultry, eggs or eggshells, sewage, and ash by fishing vessels
* Prohibition of the use of plastic packaging bands on fishing vessels

Incidental mortality of seabirds as a result of fishing has fallen to near-zero levels in the CCAMLR convention area. No mortality of seabirds or marine mammals was recorded as a result of fishing for Antarctic toothfish in 2011–12 and only two seabirds (southern giant petrels &quot;Macronectes giganteus&quot;) have been killed as a result of fishing in the Ross Sea since 1996/97.

=== Compliance ===
Compliance measures adopted by CCAMLR apply to all Antarctic toothfish fisheries. These include:
* At-sea inspections of fishing vessels
* Vessel licensing
* Port inspections of fishing vessels
* Continuous reporting of fishing vessel positions via satellite-linked vessel monitoring systems
* Catch documentation scheme for toothfish, which tracks toothfish from the point of landing through to the final point of sale and requires verification and authorisation by government authorities at each step
* The requirement to carry two scientific observers on each licensed vessel – including one from a member state other than the vessel flag

=== Sustainability ===
In November 2010, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified the Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish fishery as a sustainable and well-managed fishery. The certification is contentious, with many conservation groups protesting the certification due to the paucity of information needed to reliably manage the fishery, and that only eight of the 19 vessels in the fishery during the latest year for which data are publicly available were certified. During the 2013–14 season, vessels operating under the Marine Stewardship Certification landed 51.3% of all Antarctic toothfish from the Ross Sea Region (CCAMLR Subarea 88.1) and 64.7% of Antarctic toothfish from the Amundsen Sea sector (CCAMLR Subarea 88.2).

The argument that only a portion of Antarctic toothfish is certified, the high price it commands, and the remote areas where a large proportion of the fish are caught have been advanced as an encouragement to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and mislabeling. A 2011 genetic study of MSC-labeled Antarctic toothfish found in markets revealed a significant proportion was not from the MSC-certified stock, and many were not toothfish at all. The MSC had conducted its own internal study, which found no evidence of mislabeling. The MSC conducts an annual audit of the fishery which includes sampling of certified product.

Due to the challenges that faced toothfish management in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g., IUU fishing, mislabeling, and inadequate data for management), consumer seafood guides such as Seafood Watch placed toothfish of both species (Chilean seabass) on their red, or &quot;avoid&quot;, list; however, in light of up-to-date, internationally peer-reviewed scientific information, in April 2013, Seafood Watch upgraded the Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish fishery to a &quot;good alternative&quot;. Following a comprehensive review in 2012, the Monterey Bay Aquarium revised its rating of Antarctic toothfish to &#x27;good alternative&#x27;.

Greenpeace International added the Antarctic toothfish to its seafood red list in 2010. This approach is at variance with the high score given the fishery when it was granted certification by the MSC.

<text>Mohammed Sadeq Givi Khalkhali (; 27 July 1926 – 26 November 2003) was an Iranian Shia cleric who is said to have &quot;brought to his job as Chief Justice of the revolutionary courts a relish for summary execution&quot; that earned him a reputation as Iran&#x27;s &quot;hanging judge&quot;. A farmer&#x27;s son from Iranian Azeri origins was born in Givi, Azerbaijani SSR, in the Soviet Union (now in Azerbaijan). He is also reported to have been born in Kivi, in the Khalkhal County, Iran (ergo his name). Khalkhali has been described as &quot;a small, rotund man with a pointed beard, kindly smile, and a high-pitched giggle&quot; by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

==Career and activities==
Khalkhali was one of Khomeini&#x27;s circle of disciples as far back as 1955 and reconstructed the former secret society of Islamic assassins known as the Fadayan-e Islam after its suppression, but was not a well-known figure to the public prior to the Islamic revolution.

On 24 February 1979, Khalkhali was chosen by Ruhollah Khomeini to be the &quot;Sharia ruler&quot; () or head the newly established Revolutionary Courts, and to make Islamic rulings. In the early days of the revolution he sentenced to death &quot;hundreds of former government officials&quot; on charges such as &quot;spreading corruption on earth&quot; and &quot;warring against God.&quot; Most of the condemned did not have access to a lawyer or a jury. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Reza Shah&#x27;s mausoleum was destroyed under the direction of Khalkhali, which was sanctioned by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

Khalkhali ordered the executions of Amir Abbas Hoveida, the Shah&#x27;s longtime prime minister, and Nematollah Nassiri, a former head of SAVAK. According to one report, after sentencing Hoveida to death:
Pleas for clemency poured in from all over the world and it was said that Khalkhali was told by telephone to stay the execution. Khalkhali replied that he would go and see what was happening. He then went to Hoveyda and either shot him himself or instructed a minion to do the deed. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; he told the person at the other end of the telephone, &quot;the sentence has already been carried out.&quot;

Another version of the story has Khalkhali saying that while presiding over Hoveida&#x27;s execution he made sure communication links between Qasr Prison and the outside world were severed, &quot;to prevent any last-minute intercession on his behalf by Mehdi Bazargan, the provisional prime minister.&quot;

By trying Hoveida, Khalkhali effectively undermined the position of the provisional prime minister of the Islamic Revolution, the moderate Mehdi Bazargan, who disapproved of the Islamic Revolutionary Court and sought to establish the Revolution&#x27;s reputation for justice and moderation.

Khalkhali held antipathy towards pre-Islamic Iran. In 1979 he wrote a book &quot;branding king Cyrus the Great a tyrant, a liar, and a homosexual&quot; and &quot;called for the destruction of the Tomb of Cyrus and remains of the two-thousand-year-old Persian palace in Shiraz, Fars province, the Persepolis.&quot; According to an interview by Elaine Sciolino of Shiraz-based Ayatollah Majdeddin Mahallati, Khalkhali came to Persepolis with &quot;a band of thugs&quot; and gave an angry speech demanding that &quot;the faithful torch the silk-lined tent city and the grandstand that the Shah had built,&quot; but was driven off by stone-throwing local residents.

At the height of the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 following the failure of the American rescue mission Operation Eagle Claw and crash of U.S. helicopters killing their crews, Khalkhali appeared on television &quot;ordering the bags containing the dismembered limbs of the dead servicemen to be split open so that the blackened remains could be picked over and photographed,&quot; to the anger of American viewers.

Khalkhali, in his positions in the Islamic Revolutionary government, made it his mission to eliminate the community of Bahá&#x27;ís in Iran (the largest non-Muslim religious minority). Bahá&#x27;ís were stripped of any civil and human rights they had previously been permitted and more than 200 executed or killed in the early years of the Islamic Republic. All Bahá&#x27;í properties were seized, including its holiest site, the House of the Báb in Shiraz, which was turned over by the government to Khalkhali for the activities of the Fada&#x27;iyan-i-Islam. The site was subsequently razed, along with the entire neighborhood, for the construction of a mosque and a new road. In addition to presiding over the Islamic Revolutionary Court that brought about the execution of dozens of members of elected Bahá&#x27;í Councils, Khalkhali murdered a Bahá&#x27;í, Muhammad Muvahhed, who disappeared in 1980 into the revolutionary prison system. It was later reported that Khalkhali personally went to Muvahhed&#x27;s cell, demanded that he recant his faith and become a Muslim. When Muvahhed refused, Khalkhali covered his face with a pillow and shot him in the head.

Khalkhali later investigated and ordered the execution of many activists for federalism in Kurdistan and Turkmen Sahra, At the height of its activity, Khalkhali&#x27;s revolutionary court sentenced to death &quot;up to 60 Kurds a day.&quot; Following that, in August 1980 he was asked by President Banisadr to take charge of trying and sentencing drug dealers, and sentenced hundreds to death. One of the complaints of the revolution&#x27;s leader and Khalkhali&#x27;s superior, the Ayatollah Khomeini against the regime they had overthrown was that the Shah&#x27;s far more limited number of executions of drug traffickers had been &quot;inhuman.&quot;

In December 1980 his influence waned when he was forced to resign from the revolutionary courts because of his failure to account for $14 million seized through drug raids, confiscations, and fines, although some believe this as much the doing of President Bani-Sadr and the powerful head of the Islamic Republic Party Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti &quot;working behind the scenes&quot; to remove a source of bad publicity for the revolution, as a matter of outright corruption.

In an interview, Khalkhali personally confirmed ordering more than 100 executions, although many sources believe that by the time of his death he had sent 8,000 men and women to their deaths. In some cases he was the executioner, where he executed his victims using machine guns. In an interview with the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; he is quoted as saying, &quot;If my victims were to come back on earth, I would execute them again, without exceptions.&quot;

Khalkhali was elected as representative for Qom in Islamic Consultative Assembly for two terms, serving for &quot;more than a decade.&quot; In 1992, however, he was one of 39 incumbents from the Third Majles and 1000 or so candidates rejected that winter and spring by the Council of Guardians, which vets candidates. The reason given was a failure to show a &quot;practical commitment to Islam and to the Islamic government,&quot; but it was thought by some to be a purge of radical critics of the conservatives in power.

Khalkhali sided with reformists after the election of President Mohammad Khatami in 1997, although he was never really accepted by the movement.

==Later years and death==
Khalkhali retired to Qom, where he taught Islamic seminarians.

He died in 2003, at the age of 77, of cancer and heart disease. At the time of his death, the speaker of Parliament, Mehdi Karoubi, praised the judge&#x27;s performance in the early days of the revolution.

==Personal life==
Khalkhali was married and had a son and two daughters. His daughter, Fatemeh Sadeqi, though born in a restrictive Islamic environment, has attended university, attained PhD and is now known for her secular views. She was the author of &quot;Why We Say No to Forced Hijab&quot; – a widely circulated 2008 essay.

<text>Come Dancing is a British ballroom dancing competition show made by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which aired on BBC One at various intervals from 1950 to 1998. Unlike its subsequent follow-up show, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, contestants were neither celebrities nor professionals.

The show was created by Eric Morley, the founder of Miss World, in 1949, and began by broadcasting from regional ballroom studios owned by Mecca, with professional dancers Syd Perkin and Edna Duffield on hand to offer teaching. Its original format was based on a knock-out process of teams from various regions around the UK, such as East Anglia or the South West. In 1953, the format changed to become a competition, with dancers representing the home nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales), with later series seeing regions of the United Kingdom going head to head for its coveted trophy.

==Broadcast==
In 1950, &quot;Come Dancing&quot; joined &quot;Television Dancing Club&quot;, and the two programmes ran on alternate weeks until 1964, when the latter finished. At its peak, in the late 1960s and 1970s, it attracted audiences of ten million. The last regular series was aired in 1995 (with no series in 1982 or 1987); this was followed by &quot;International Come Dancing&quot; specials in 1996 and 1998. The final episode, a 50th anniversary special, was presented by Rosemarie Ford and broadcast on BBC One from the Royal Albert Hall in London on 29 December 1998.

In 2023, BBC Four began repeating episodes of the show from the 1970s. The entire 1979 run was repeated by BBC Four in January and February alongside an episode from 1977 and the Grand Final from 1974. On 12 October 2024, the channel repeated the 1990 Grand Final, as part of an 80th birthday celebration night for former &quot;Come Dancing&quot; presenter Angela Rippon, which also features future Strictly head judge Len Goodman as part of the judging panel.

==Presenters==
The first presenter in 1950 was Peter Dimmock, and was assisted by Leslie Mitchell as its master of ceremonies. Many subsequent presenters over the years included Sylvia Peters, Peter West (1957 to 1972), McDonald Hobley, Charles Nove, Terry Wogan, Brian Johnston, Peter Marshall, Angela Rippon, Frank Bough, Michael Aspel, David Jacobs, Judith Chalmers, Pete Murray and Rosemarie Ford. Commentators included Ray Moore, Bruce Hammal, and Charles Nove.

==Revival==
Inspired by the resurgence in ballroom dancing in the UK following the 1992 Australian film &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;, a relaunched celebrity version entitled &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; (affectionately known simply as &quot;Strictly&quot;) debuted on BBC One in 2004, and became a major success with Saturday evening audiences. &quot;Strictly&quot; paired a professional dancer together with a celebrity partner, and was originally hosted by Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, assisted by Claudia Winkleman. In later years, Claudia Winkleman was promoted to full-time host in 2014 after Forsyth&#x27;s departure. The title is an amalgamation of the titles of &quot;Come Dancing&quot; and the film &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;. The format of the newer show has become an international success, having been successfully exported to many other countries as &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; or similar names in local languages.

<doc id="404122" wikidata="Q500279" url="?curid=404122" title="Pirates of Silicon Valley">
<text>Pirates of Silicon Valley is a 1999 American biographical drama television film directed by Martyn Burke and starring Noah Wyle as Steve Jobs and Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates. Spanning the years 1971–1997 and based on Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer&quot;, it explores the impact that the rivalry between Jobs (Apple Computer) and Gates (Microsoft) had on the development of the personal computer. The film premiered on TNT on June 20, 1999.

==Plot==
Steve Jobs is speaking with director Ridley Scott about the creation of the 1984 advertisement for Apple Computer, which introduced the first Macintosh. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that &quot;We&#x27;re creating a completely new consciousness.&quot; Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the advertisement.

Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve &quot;Woz&quot; Wozniak, is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they &quot;got from there to here&quot;, the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple.

The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, &quot;Those guys think they&#x27;re revolutionaries. They&#x27;re not revolutionaries, we are.&quot; Wozniak then comments that &quot;Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he&#x27;d see karma or the meaning of the universe.&quot;

Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer, and Gates&#x27;s high school friend Paul Allen. As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates&#x27;s story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts&#x27;s MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard. Gates&#x27;s and Allen&#x27;s early work with MITS is juxtaposed against the involvement of Jobs and Wozniak with the &quot;Homebrew Computer Club&quot;. Jobs and Woz develop Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs&#x27;s family home, with the help of Daniel and Elizabeth. Eventually, Mike Markkula invests in the company which allows it to expand and move forward. In 1977, Jobs, Woz, and Markkula demo the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire. This event is followed by the development of the IBM PC with the help of Gates and Microsoft in 1981.

The film follows Jobs&#x27;s relationship with his high school girlfriend and early Apple employee, Arlene (a pseudonym for Chrisann Brennan), and the difficulties he had with acknowledging his parental legitimacy of their daughter, Lisa. Around the time she was born, Jobs unveiled his next computer, which he named Lisa. The Lisa was followed in 1984 by the Macintosh, both having been inspired by the Xerox Alto.

On the eve of the release of Windows 1.0 (and with Microsoft&#x27;s licensing deal with NEC undercutting Apple&#x27;s dealings in Japan), Jobs and Gates have a bitter falling out. Jobs claimed that Gates completely ripped off of Apple&#x27;s design. Gates responds by saying that Apple had done the same thing to Xerox, and rather that it was analogous to both of them stealing from a rich neighbor who left their door unlocked. The main body of the film finally concludes with a 30th birthday toast in 1985 to Steve Jobs shortly before he was forced out of Apple by CEO John Sculley.

The film ends in 1997, with the return of 42-year-old Jobs to Apple (after its acquisition of NeXT Computer) and with his announcement at the MacWorld Expo of an alliance between Apple and Microsoft. It also indicates that Jobs is now married, has children, and has reconciled with Lisa.

==Production==
===Development===
Burke notes that when he was shown the first draft of the screenplay, which is based upon Freiberger and Swaine&#x27;s &quot;Fire in the Valley,&quot; &quot;It was all about how the &#x27;286 computer&#x27; became the &#x27;386&#x27; and so on ... I was bored by it.&quot; After the studio asked him for suggestions Burke states that &quot;I&#x27;m a great believer in Shakespeare, and what we had was a modern equivalent of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, featuring two young princes, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs ... the more I read about Steve in particular, the more I saw him in those Shakespearean terms. He was brilliant, volcanic, obsessive, suspicious, even vicious in a business sense. He was about conquest, always conquest. I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the sort of movie I want to make.&#x27;&quot; Burke was thus hired as director of the project and rewrote the screenplay. In developing the characters themselves, Burke also stated that he chose not to speak with any of the central figures portrayed in the film:

===Casting===

Burke sought Noah Wyle for the part of Jobs. Wyle originally turned down the role, but changed his mind after Burke had him watch the 1996 documentary, &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot;. Wyle states that he watched the documentary &quot;for ten seconds and knew I&#x27;d kick myself for the rest of my life if I didn&#x27;t play this part.&quot; He also noted that &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot; led him to be &quot;taken by [Jobs&#x27;s] presence, his confidence, smugness, smartness, ego, and his story&#x27;s trajectory. He seemed to be the most Shakespearean figure in American culture in the last 50 years I could think of – the rise of, the fall of, and the return of. The truest definition of a tragic hero—but you get the &#x27;bonus round&#x27; that F. Scott Fitzgerald said didn&#x27;t exist. Jobs has had one hell of a second act.&quot; Burke later credited Wyle for the success of the film stating that, &quot;whatever was in the air, [Wyle] just absorbed it ... he became Jobs. It was a remarkable transformation. We had a photo of Steve Jobs at about 28 years old, from the cover of Fortune magazine. We did a mockup with Noah and it was almost impossible to tell them apart.&quot; Burke also credits Joey Slotnick&#x27;s interpretation of Steve Wozniak with Wozniak&#x27;s enthusiasm for the film; Wozniak was so impressed that he flew to Los Angeles to have lunch with Slotnick. Burke notes that, &quot;Steve Wozniak made several speeches in which he said that the film accurately portrays how things actually happened ... To me that was better than any awards or nominations the film could get.&quot;

Anthony Michael Hall, who was cast as Bill Gates, commented on his interest in the role, stating that he, &quot;really fought for this part because I knew it would be the role of a lifetime ... it was a thrill and a daunting challenge to play someone of his stature and brilliance.&quot;

===Filming===
&quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; was originally scheduled to be shot in Toronto, with more than $1 million in sets. However, when Wyle was unable to receive a long enough release from &quot;ER&quot; to shoot in Canada, the film temporarily shut down. Filming began again later in Los Angeles. During the filming, the cast broke down into PC and Mac factions, arguing over the merits of each platform. Burke states that he began the film as a PC user and ended a Mac user.

==Themes==
Young Steve Jobs participated in aspects of the 1960s counterculture. Actor Noah Wyle, who portrays Jobs, stated in an interview with CNN, &quot;These kids grew up 30 miles south of the [University of California] Berkeley campus, which was ripe with revolution ... and they couldn&#x27;t have cared less about the politics going on. They were in the garage tinkering with their electronics and starting a revolution that was a thousand times greater than anything that was going on the college campuses, politically.&quot; Director Martyn Burke also noted in an interview that, &quot;Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are the true revolutionaries of our time. Not the students who occupied the dean&#x27;s office in the late &#x27;60s. Not the anti-war marchers who were determined to overthrow the establishment. Jobs and Gates are the ones who changed the way the world thinks, acts and communicates.&quot;

== Music ==
The soundtrack consists of classic rock, disco, and new wave from the 1960s, 1970s, and early-mid 1980s.

The piano song that is playing in the scene when Steve Jobs accuses Bill Gates of stealing Apple&#x27;s ideas is not on the soundtrack. That omission sparked a search that lasted a few years until it was eventually found to be &quot;Soliloquy&quot; by English composer Tony Hymas. The song was originally published in the 1980 collection &quot;The Piano Album&quot;, correctly fitting the movie events timeline.

== Reception ==

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10.
Ray Richmond of &quot;Variety&quot; states that it is &quot;a brilliant piece of filmmaking&quot; and &quot;a wildly entertaining geek tragedy with the stylistic feel of true art.&quot;
John Leonard of &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, refers to it as &quot;a hoot&quot;.
Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; argues that the film is &quot;a fascinating drama filled with Shakespearean twists and betrayals as viewers come to know the geniuses who transformed not only the way we communicate, but the way we live.&quot; 
Brian J. Dillard of &quot;AllMovie&quot; argues that &quot;thanks to inspired casting and strong writing, this well-oiled TV biopic managed to transform the unglamorous genesis of the personal-computer industry into solid entertainment precisely at the moment when dot-com mania was sweeping the nation.&quot; 
Mike Lipton of &quot;People&quot;, found the film to be &quot;engagingly irreverent&quot; and &quot;a real-life &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; [that] stands cheekily on its own.&quot;

===Historical accuracy===
Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Steve Wozniak all responded to the film. Jobs&#x27;s only public response occurred at the 1999 Macworld Expo. After &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; had aired, he contacted Noah Wyle and told him that while he &quot;hated&quot; both the film and the screenplay, he liked Wyle&#x27;s performance, noting &quot;you do look like me.&quot; Jobs then invited Wyle to the 1999 Macworld convention to play a prank on the audience. Wyle agreed and initially appeared as Jobs, until Jobs walked onto the stage and let the audience in on the joke. In contrast, Jobs avoided meeting the director Martyn Burke, who later said that &quot;Steve wanted nothing to do with me.&quot; In a 2013 &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; session with Reddit, Gates responded to a question about his portrayal in the film by stating that it was &quot;reasonably accurate&quot;.

Wozniak had a positive response to the film and discussed it in detail with fans on his official website. Wozniak said that many aspects of the film were accurate, stating that &quot;when the movie opened with [a scene of] tear gas and riots ... I thought, &#x27;My God! That&#x27;s just how it was.&#x27;&quot; He also responded to a fan email, that some of his portrayal was inaccurate: &quot;I never quit Apple. That suggestion was based on an incorrect &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; [article] that said I was leaving Apple because I didn&#x27;t like things there. Actually, I had told the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; writer that I wasn&#x27;t leaving Apple because of things that I didn&#x27;t like and that I wasn&#x27;t even leaving, keeping my small salary forever as a loyal employee. I just wanted a small startup experience and a chance to design a smaller product again, a universal remote control.&quot; In May 2015, Wozniak once again commented on the film, stating that &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; is an example of a good Hollywood dramatization of himself, Steve Jobs, and the story of Apple Inc. He described &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; as &quot;intriguing, interesting. I loved watching it ... every one of those incidences occurred and it occurred with the meaning that was shown&quot; in the film.

A college friend of Jobs and early Apple employee Daniel Kottke also liked the film. He noted in an interview that it was &quot;a great movie. Noah Wyle was just uncannily close to Jobs. Just unbelievable. I found myself thinking it was actually Steve on the screen.&quot; He also states that in the film there were &quot;all these scenes of the garage where it&#x27;s like half a dozen people working, busily carrying things back and forth, and oscilloscopes&quot; when he [Kottke] &quot;was really the only person who worked in the garage. Woz would show up once a week with his latest to test it out, and Steve Jobs was on the phone a lot in the kitchen.&quot;

Two individuals have responded to the film&#x27;s interpretation of the 1979 visit of Jobs and his team to the Xerox PARC research center, which influenced the development of both the Lisa and Macintosh computers. PARC&#x27;s director, John Seely Brown stated in a 2006 interview that the scene in which Gates and Jobs argue about the role of Xerox is not entirely accurate. He said that Jobs was invited by PARC to view their technology in exchange for the ability to buy pre-IPO Apple stock. Wozniak said, &quot;Apple worked with Xerox openly to bring their developments to a mass audience. That&#x27;s what Steve portrayed Apple as being good at. Xerox got a lot of Apple stock for it too, it was an agreement. Microsoft just took it from Xerox or Apple or whomever. It took them a long time to get it halfway right.&quot;

<text>The Cherven Cities (), Czerwień Cities or Cherven Gords (Ukrainian: Червенські Городи), often literally translated as Red Cities, Red Forts or Red Boroughs, was a point of dispute between the Kingdom of Poland and Kievan Rus&#x27; at the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries, with both sides claiming their rights to the land.

==Etymology==
Originally, the name &quot;Czerwień Cities&quot; probably identified a territory between the Bug and Wieprz rivers. Its name is derived from Czerwień (cf. Proto-Slavic &quot;red&quot;), a &quot;gord&quot; that existed there, possibly on the site of the present-day village of Czermno. The first mention of the &quot;Cherven Cities&quot; is given by the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (12th century), when Vladimir the Great captured them from the &quot;Lyakhs&quot; (Poles and Lendians) in 981.

==History==

The Cherven Cities first described in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; by Nestor the Chronicler have a central role in the history of the Early Medieval Polish-Ruthenian borderlands. The area is first mentioned in 981, when Vladimir the Great took it during his expansion campaign to the west:

Cosmas of Prague (c. 1045 – 1125) relates that the Přemyslid rulers of Bohemia controlled the land of Kraków until 999. In support of Cosmas, the foundation charter of the Archdiocese of Prague (1086) traces the Eastern border of the archdiocese, as established in 973, along the Bug and Styr (or Stryi) rivers, which marked the approximate boundaries of the region where Cherven Cities were located. Abraham ben Jacob, who travelled in Eastern Europe in 965, remarks that Boleslaus II of Bohemia ruled the country &quot;stretching from the city of Prague to the city of Kraków&quot;.

In the 970s, it is assumed that Mieszko I of Poland took over the region: the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; infers this when reporting that Vladimir the Great conquered the Cherven Cities from the Lyakhs (an alternative archaic name for Poles) in 981. Nestor writes in his chronicle that: &quot;Vladimir marched upon the Lyakhs and took their cities: Peremyshl (Przemyśl), Cherven (Czermno), and other towns, all of which are subject to Rus&#x27; even to this day&quot;. However, historian Leontii Voitovych speculates that contrary to Nestor&#x27;s account in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, if the lands were under control of the Duchy of Poland then the Kievan Rus&#x27; conquest would have been an open call for war between the principalities with an inevitable long struggle, but such a thing did not happen according to Voitovych, possibly indicating in Voitovych&#x27;s view that the lands and its population weren&#x27;t Polish, but an independent political-tribal union with some vassalage to Bohemia. 

In 1018, Poland re-took the area under Bolesław I the Brave, and in 1031 it fell again to Rus&#x27;. The Rus&#x27;ian expedition against Poland (1030–1031) had as its object not only the recovery of territories previously lost in 1018; it also delivered a powerful blow against the Polish Metropolis of Slavonic rite. In 1031, Harald and his men reached the land of the Kievan Rus, where they served the armies of Yaroslav I the Wise, the Grand Prince of the Rus, whose wife Ingigerd was a distant relative of Harald. In the spring 1031, where he became chief of Yaroslav&#x27;s bodyguard jointly with Eilifr, son of that Rognvaldr who had originally come to Novgorod with Ingigerd. Harald served a military apprenticeship, fighting in the Polish campaign of 1031, and against the &quot;Læsir&quot; (Lendians). The gord of Sutiejsk was most likely founded in 1034 - 1039 by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, who built the fortified settlement to guard the border with Poland. Around the year 1069, the region again returned to Poland, after Bolesław II the Generous retook the area and the city of Przemyśl, making it his temporary residence. Then in 1085, the region became a principality under the lordship of Rus&#x27;, known as the Principality of Peremyshl.

<text>Carl Oskar Ursinus (11 March 1877 – 6 July 1952) was a pioneer of German aviation and is remembered mainly for his contributions to sailplane designs and the sport of gliding. He has been nicknamed the &quot;Rhönvater&quot; (&quot;Rhön father&quot;) because he founded Germany’s first gliding club at the Wasserkuppe in the Rhön Mountains in 1920.

Ursinus was born in Weißenfels and attended Technical College in Mittweida. After graduation, he worked for Borsig on compressors for locomotives, and spent some time working on mining machinery in Romania for the firm.

In 1908, back in Germany, Ursinus began to publish a magazine titled &quot;Flugsport&quot; (“Sports Flying”), since he had become fascinated by the new technology of flight. The magazine helped establish a network among Germany’s aviation enthusiasts, and led to the organisation of Germany’s first international airshow.

He was conscripted into the German Army in 1914 and requested a position in aircraft design. The request was approved and he was posted to Gothaer Waggonfabrik designing warplanes. The famous series of Gotha bombers used by the German air corps throughout World War I, were all based on an Ursinus design of 1915 that was refined and manufactured as the Gotha G.I. Ursinus&#x27; real passion, however, was for seaplanes, and in 1916 he designed a seaplane fighter with retractable floats that was unfortunately destroyed before testing was complete.

Following the war, the Treaty of Versailles prohibited Germany from building powered aircraft, and the attention of German aviators therefore turned to gliding. A plateau particularly suited to gliding, the Wasserkuppe, became a focal point for this activity, and in 1920, Ursinus organized a competition there. Twenty-four people attended the meeting between 15 July and 15 September 1920, including Wolf Hirth and other gliding pioneers. (see also Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft.)

Over the next decade, this grew in importance to become an international event. Ursinus also constructed the first clubhouse on the Wasserkuppe in 1924. He was pursuing experiments in human-powered flight when the outbreak of World War II intervened.

Following the war, powered flying was once again forbidden in Germany, but Ursinus lived just long enough to see this prohibition lifted.

Today, he is regarded in Germany as the father of gliding, and Germany’s association for homebuilt aircraft, the &quot;Oskar Ursinus-Vereinigung&quot; (&quot;Oskar Ursinus Association&quot;) bears his name.

<doc id="404130" wikidata="Q2037833" url="?curid=404130" title="Piecewise function">
<text>In mathematics, a piecewise function (also called a piecewise-defined function, a hybrid function, or a function defined by cases) is a function whose domain is partitioned into several intervals (&quot;subdomains&quot;) on which the function may be defined differently. Piecewise definition is actually a way of specifying the function, rather than a characteristic of the resulting function itself.

Terms like piecewise linear, piecewise smooth, piecewise continuous, and others are very common. The meaning of a function being piecewise formula_1, for a property formula_1 is roughly that the domain of the function can be partitioned into pieces on which the property formula_1 holds, but is used slightly differently by different authors. Sometimes the term is used in a more global sense involving triangulations; see Piecewise linear manifold.

== Notation and interpretation ==
Piecewise functions can be defined using the common functional notation, where the body of the function is an array of functions and associated subdomains. A semicolon or comma may follow the subfunction or subdomain columns. The formula_4 or formula_5 is rarely omitted at the start of the right column.

The subdomains together must cover the whole domain; often it is also required that they are pairwise disjoint, i.e. form a partition of the domain. In order for the overall function to be called &quot;piecewise&quot;, the subdomains are usually required to be intervals (some may be degenerated intervals, i.e. single points or unbounded intervals). For bounded intervals, the number of subdomains is required to be finite, for unbounded intervals it is often only required to be locally finite. For example, consider the piecewise definition of the absolute value function:
formula_6
For all values of formula_7 less than zero, the first sub-function (formula_8) is used, which negates the sign of the input value, making negative numbers positive. For all values of formula_7 greater than or equal to zero, the second sub-function is used, which evaluates trivially to the input value itself.

The following table documents the absolute value function at certain values of formula_7:
In order to evaluate a piecewise-defined function at a given input value, the appropriate subdomain needs to be chosen in order to select the correct sub-function—and produce the correct output value.

== Examples ==

* A step function or piecewise constant function, composed of constant sub-functions
* Piecewise linear function, composed of linear sub-functions
* Broken power law, a function composed of power-law sub-functions
* Spline, a function composed of polynomial sub-functions, often constrained to be smooth at the joints between pieces
** B-spline
* PDIFF
* formula_11 and some other common Bump functions. These are infinitely differentiable, but analyticity holds only piecewise.

== Continuity and differentiability of piecewise-defined functions ==
A piecewise-defined function is continuous on a given interval in its domain if the following conditions are met:
* its sub-functions are continuous on the corresponding intervals (subdomains),
* there is no discontinuity at an endpoint of any subdomain within that interval.

The pictured function, for example, is piecewise-continuous throughout its subdomains, but is not continuous on the entire domain, as it contains a jump discontinuity at formula_12. The filled circle indicates that the value of the right sub-function is used in this position.

For a piecewise-defined function to be differentiable on a given interval in its domain, the following conditions have to fulfilled in addition to those for continuity above:
* its sub-functions are differentiable on the corresponding &quot;open&quot; intervals,
* the one-sided derivatives exist at all intervals&#x27; endpoints,
* at the points where two subintervals touch, the corresponding one-sided derivatives of the two neighboring subintervals coincide.
Some sources only examine the function definition, while others acknowledge the property iff the function admits a partition into a piecewise definition that meets the conditions.

== Applications ==

In applied mathematical analysis, &quot;piecewise-regular&quot; functions have been found to be consistent with many models of the human visual system, where images are perceived at a first stage as consisting of smooth regions separated by edges (as in a cartoon);
a cartoon-like function is a C2 function, smooth except for the existence of discontinuity curves.
In particular, shearlets have been used as a representation system to provide sparse approximations of this model class in 2D and 3D.

Piecewise defined functions are also commonly used for interpolation, such as in nearest-neighbor interpolation.

<text>The golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa) is a very small songbird in the family Regulidae that lives throughout much of North America.

== Description ==

Adults are olive-gray on the upperparts with white underparts, with thin bills and short tails. They have white wing bars, a black stripe through the eyes and a yellow crown surrounded by black. The adult male has an orange patch in the middle of the yellow crown. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but with a browner back and without the yellow crown. This is one of the smallest passerines in North America. Its length, at , is probably the shortest of any American passerine. Its weight, averaging for females and 6.3 g (0.22 oz) for males and ranging from , is similar to the American bushtit and black-tailed gnatcatcher. The golden-crowned kinglet has a wingspan of 5.5–7.1 in (14–18 cm).

== Ecology ==
The golden-crowned kinglet is insectivorous, foraging in trees or shrubs, where it eats insects (especially caterpillars), insect eggs and spiders. It produces a series of high-pitched calls on a single note, and tends not to fear human approach. Its nest is a well-concealed hanging cup suspended from a conifer branch.

== Distribution ==

The golden-crowned kinglet is a widespread migratory bird throughout North America. Its breeding habitat is coniferous forests across Canada, the northeastern and western United States, Mexico and Central America. It migrates to the United States in the non-breeding season. Some birds are permanent residents in coastal regions and in the southern parts of their range. Northern birds remain further north in winter than the ruby-crowned kinglet.

== Taxonomy ==

The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but frequently given family status, especially as recent research showed that, despite superficial similarities, the crests are taxonomically remote from the warblers. The names of the family, Regulidae, and its only genus, &quot;Regulus&quot;, are derived from the Latin &quot;regulus&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;rex&quot;, &quot;a king&quot;, and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets.

There are three migratory subspecies in the United States and Canada, differing in size, bill length, back and rump colours, wing bar width and colour, and length of supercilium:
* &quot;R. s. apache&quot;, breeding and wintering from southern Alaska and the southern Yukon to southwestern California and southern New Mexico. This subspecies is medium-small, has a long bill, and has the back and rump bright yellowish-olive.
* &quot;R. s. olivaceus&quot;, breeding from coastal southeastern Alaska to southwestern Oregon, wintering to Idaho and southwestern California. This subspecies is small, with a medium-long bill, and has the back and rump dark greenish-olive.
* &quot;R. s. satrapa&quot;, breeding from northern Alberta to Newfoundland and North Carolina. This subspecies is large, with a short bill, has the back and rump olive with a greyish wash. It further differs from &quot;apache&quot; and &quot;olivaceus&quot; in two other regards: the white supercilium stops short of the rear of the crown, whereas on the other two species the supercilium extends farther back, and the wingbars are wide, and white (or slightly lemon-tinged) compared with narrow dingy whitish (or lemon- or olive-washed) wingbars of the other two subspecies.

The subspecies &quot;amoenus&quot; has been synonymised with &quot;apache&quot;, as the distinctions between these populations are obscured by individual variation.

Two other (non-migratory) subspecies occur south of the bird&#x27;s core range, although these are weakly differentiated from each other and so are perhaps best synonymised:
* &quot;R. s. aztecus&quot; in south-central Mexico, in the mountains from Michoacán south to Oaxaca. This subspecies is dark greenish above, has poorly developed wing markings, and its underparts are washed greyish-brown.
* &quot;R. s. clarus&quot; in the mountains of Chiapas, southern Mexico, and Guatemala. This subspecies resembles &quot;aztecus&quot; but is paler and duller, with a shorter tail.

Hybridization with ruby-crowned kinglets has been reported to have possibly occurred.

He also won seven caps for England. His formidable and powerful shot was regarded as the hardest shot of his era. Houghton converted 58 spot kicks and also scored direct from about 30 free-kicks. He is often referred to as &#x27;Mr Aston Villa&#x27; in recognition of his long standing service and contribution to the club.

Houghton scored 30 goals in the 1930–31 season, in which Villa scored 128 league goals, a First Division record.

Houghton finished his playing career at Notts County.

After managing Notts County, he went on to become Aston Villa manager, guiding Villa to a record seventh FA Cup triumph in 1957. He later returned to Villa as a director, the only person to do this at the club. He had four children. In 2006 the club announced the creation of an Aston Villa Hall of Fame. This was voted for by fans and the inaugural induction saw 12 former players, managers and directors named. Eric Houghton was chosen.

He also played seven first-class matches as a right-handed batsman and a right-arm bowler for Warwickshire County Cricket Club (1946–1947) and also minor counties cricket for Lincolnshire County Cricket Club. He also played club cricket for Sleaford, Aston Unity and Olton Cricket Clubs.

His brother, Roy Houghton, and cousin, Reg Goodacre, were also footballers. His son Neil chaired Warwickshire County Cricket Club (2003–2011) and his great-nephew Chris Woods was a successful international footballer.

He died in Sutton Coldfield on 1 May 1996, aged 85.

<text>The Dutch Language Union ( , NTU) is an international regulatory institution that governs issues regarding the Dutch language. It is best known for its spelling reforms which are promulgated by member states, grammar books, the Green Booklet and its support of Dutch language courses and studies worldwide. It was founded on a treaty concluded between the Netherlands and Belgium (in respect of the Flemish Community) on 9 September 1980. Suriname has been an associate member of the &quot;Taalunie&quot; since 2004.

==History==
The Dutch Language Union was established by a treaty between Belgium and the Netherlands, signed on 9 September 1980 in Brussels. It succeeded the &quot;Cultural Agreement&quot; (governing more than just language) between the two countries signed just after the Second World War. This agreement was redone in 1995, after the federalization of Belgium, and a new treaty was signed between the Netherlands and Flanders. On 12 December 2003, president of the Committee of Ministers of the Dutch Language Union Medy van der Laan and Minister of Education of Suriname Walter Sandriman signed the agreement to the accession of Suriname to the union. The accession was ratified by the National Assembly of Suriname in 2004 and came into force in 2005.
Standard Dutch (&quot;Algemeen Nederlands&quot;, often abbreviated to &quot;AN&quot;) is the standard language as it is taught in schools and used by authorities in the Netherlands, Flanders, Suriname, and the Dutch Caribbean. The Dutch Language Union defines what is &quot;AN&quot; and what is not. Since efforts to &quot;uplift&quot; people had come to be considered rather presumptuous, the earlier name &quot;Algemeen Beschaafd Nederlands&quot; (&quot;Common Civilised Dutch&quot;) and its abbreviation, &quot;ABN&quot;, were replaced with &quot;Algemeen Nederlands&quot; (&quot;AN&quot;). The implication that non-standard varieties are not civilised was thus removed.

==Word list==
An important change that was carried out by the Dutch Language Union was the modification of Dutch orthography in 1995, regarding in particular the writing of the interfix &quot;-n&quot; in many compounds. Among the Union&#x27;s publications is the well-known Word list of the Dutch language (&quot;Woordenlijst Nederlandse taal&quot;), commonly known as the “&quot;Groene boekje&quot;” (&quot;Green booklet&quot;, because of its distinctive green colour). The green booklet is the official orthographic and grammatical reference of the Dutch language. It is laid out like a vocabulary, including plural forms and spelling but without actual word definitions.

The most recent version of the Green Booklet appeared on 13 October 2015. Its content does not differ from the previous version of 2005, which included a somewhat controversial spelling reform that was not received well in general because a part of the spelling reforms of 1996 was changed again. In December 2005, most of the Dutch mainstream media announced a boycott. In August 2006, they released a &#x27;White book&#x27; as their own, subtly different guideline. Currently these two spellings are both in use, sometimes confusing people; the &#x27;green&#x27; one is used by schools and officials, the &#x27;white&#x27; one by papers, magazines and television stations.

In Belgium, on the other hand, the spelling reform was generally accepted without protest.

==Dictionary==
The Van Dale dictionary is commonly accepted as the most authoritative Dutch dictionary. Commonly named the Dikke Van Dale (&quot;Thick&quot; Van Dale due to its size) the dictionary is split into three volumes (A–I, J–R, S–Z) and is usually updated every 7–8 years. The 15th edition was published on 23 September 2015.

The &quot;Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal&quot; (WNT) is a historic dictionary that includes all words used from 1500 to the present day. 
Work began in 1864 and was finished in 1998 when the last volume was published. It has 46 volumes, occupying about 3 metres of shelf space, with about 400,000 words on 49,255 pages. In 2001, three additional volumes were published containing mostly words from the 20th century that were not included in the previous 43 volumes. This dictionary is published by Instituut voor Nederlandse Lexicologie and can be found online.

== Dutch as a foreign language ==
The Dutch Language Union supports the teaching of Dutch in primary and secondary schools in the neighbouring regions and countries. It concerns Belgium (Brussels and Wallonia; 350,000 learners), Germany (Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia, 40,000 learners) and France (Nord-Pas-de-Calais, 8,000 learners).

The Union also supports the study of Dutch language and culture at universities and schools worldwide. Approximately 14,000 people study the Dutch language and Dutch literature at 140 institutions.

==Organisation==
===Internal organisation===
The NTU has offices in The Hague and Brussels, and it comprises four institutions:
*The Secretariat-General, responsible for preparing and implementing policy, headed by Kris Van de Poel since March 2020
*The Committee of Ministers, containing the ministers of education and culture from the Netherlands and Flanders;
*The Interparliamentary Commission, made up of members of the Dutch and Flemish parliaments;
*The Council for Dutch Language and Literature.

====&quot;Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal&quot;====
The binational (Belgium and the Netherlands) &quot;Instituut voor de Nederlandse Taal&quot; (&quot;Institute for the Dutch Language&quot;) in Leiden, formerly &quot;Instituut voor Nederlandse Lexicologie&quot;, works under the auspices of the Dutch Language Union, and is responsible for the &quot;Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal&quot; (Dictionary of the Dutch language). In addition, the institute publishes a number of dictionaries, including the &quot;Old Dutch Dictionary&quot;, the &quot;Early Middle Dutch Dictionary&quot;, and an etymological dictionary; and databases, including databases indexing various newspapers and magazines, and legal documents. The &quot;Spoken Dutch Corpus&quot; has contemporary Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands and Flanders, including audio recordings of Standard Dutch.

====Royal Academy of Dutch Language and Literature====
The Royal Academy of Dutch Language and Literature was founded in Belgium in 1886 to stimulate the culture and literature of Flanders. It is the official advisory board to the Flanders government, and publishes the &quot;Materiaal Willems&quot; database, based on the dialect surveys done by Pieter Willems, containing material from dialects in Flanders, the Netherlands, and French Flanders.

===External connections===
The organisation is also responsible for the external linguistic policy of the Netherlands and Flanders and is active in Indonesia and South Africa, two countries with historic links with the Dutch language. Nevertheless, cooperation with South Africa is not limited to the Afrikaans language but aimed also at fostering multilingualism.

The purposes of the organisation are limited to Dutch language and Dutch-language literature, and are hence not as wide as those of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, La Francophonie or the Commonwealth of Nations.

The Treaty on the Dutch Language Union foresees the possibility that the Kingdom of the Netherlands extends application to NTU members’ parts outside Europe. The organs of the NTU are its Committee of Ministers (composed of the ministers of education and culture of the Dutch and Flemish Governments), its Secretariat-General, an Interparliamentary Committee (composed of members of the States General of the Netherlands and the Flemish Parliament) and a Dutch Language and Literature Council (composed of twelve independent experts). There are specific arrangements for the participation of Suriname in the organisation&#x27;s inner workings.

===Member states===
The basis of the Taalunie is a treaty between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Belgium, the two sovereign states that constitute the Union. For the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the treaty is only applicable to its European territory.
The treaty allows for two types of extensions:
* membership of other sovereign states through an &quot;association membership&quot;
* extension to other territories of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (presently: Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and the Caribbean Netherlands).

In 2004, Suriname signed an &quot;associative treaty&quot; with the Taalunie. From 27 November 2013 the treaty also applies to the Caribbean Netherlands.
The three autonomous Caribbean countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, are designated as candidate member states. Additionally, Indonesia and South Africa are considered &quot;special partners&quot; of the Dutch Language Union.

== Prizes ==
The Dutch Language Union has administered the Prijs der Nederlandse Letteren (&quot;Dutch Literature Prize&quot;) since 1986. The prize is awarded every three years to an author from the Netherlands, Belgium or Suriname. It is considered one of the most prestigious prizes in Dutch language literature. 

Another literary award administered by the Dutch Language Union is the Toneelschrijfprijs for playwrights.

<doc id="404146" wikidata="Q2737692" url="?curid=404146" title="Christine Chapel">
<text>Christine Chapel is a fictional character who appears in all three seasons of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, as well as &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; and the films &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; and &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;. Portrayed by Majel Barrett, she was the ship&#x27;s nurse on board the Starfleet starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. A younger version of Chapel appears in the 2022 series &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, portrayed by Jess Bush.

Barrett had previously been cast under her real name as Number One in the first pilot for the series, &quot;The Cage&quot;, during her romantic relationship with the series creator Gene Roddenberry. But following feedback from network executives, she was not in the cast for the second pilot.

The character made her first appearance in &quot;The Naked Time&quot; following a re-write of the script by Roddenberry. He had been inspired after Barrett dyed her hair blonde for a potential role in the episode &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;, which convinced him that NBC executives might not notice if he recast Barrett as a different character in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. However, the executives immediately recognized Barrett. The character was featured in several episodes covering several broad themes, such as showing her feelings for Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and why she joined Starfleet. By the time of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;, Chapel was shown as a fully trained Starfleet doctor, and by the &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;, she was stationed at Starfleet Command.

Executive producer Robert H. Justman was initially critical of Barrett&#x27;s performance as Chapel, but recanted this opinion after her appearance as Lwaxana Troi in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Barrett herself was not fond of the Chapel character, and David Gerrold felt that she only served to demonstrate Spock&#x27;s emotionless behavior. Critics saw the character as being a degradation for Barrett compared to her first character. While the position of nurse was seen as a stereotype, the character&#x27;s promotion to doctor was praised. Certain episodes featuring her were criticized, such as &quot;Amok Time&quot;, where the plot prevented her from having a relationship with Spock, and &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;, where it was suggested she was featured to the detriment of other characters. Among fans, she was initially unpopular due to her feelings for Spock, but prior to the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, there was a desire to see her return.

==Concept and development==

Prior to working on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Gene Roddenberry had been developing a variety of television pilots for Screen Gems. One actress he auditioned was Majel Leigh Hudec, later to use the name Majel Barrett. Later when he created the drama series &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, he cast her in the episode &quot;In the Highest Tradition&quot;. They quickly became friends, and entered into a romantic relationship although Roddenberry was married at the time. During the development of the first pilot for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; (&quot;The Cage&quot;), Roddenberry wrote the part of Number One (the ship&#x27;s second in command) specifically for Barrett. There was reluctance from the NBC executives to agree to an actress who was almost unknown. Roddenberry did see other actresses for the part, but no one else was considered.

Executive producer Herbert Franklin Solow attempted to sell them on the idea that a fresh face would bring believability to the part, but they were aware that she was Roddenberry&#x27;s girlfriend. Despite this they agreed to her casting, not wanting to upset Roddenberry at this point in the production. After the pilot was rejected, a second pilot was produced. While it was generally explained that the network disliked a female character as the second-in-command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Solow had a different opinion of events. He explained that &quot;No one liked her acting... she was a nice woman, but the reality was, she couldn&#x27;t act.&quot; &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; successfully took &quot;Star Trek&quot; to a series order. Barrett had been given the role of voicing the computer on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but was demanding that Roddenberry write her into the main cast.

After seeing the initial proposal for &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;, Barrett felt that she could play the woman who went into space to find her fiancé. She dyed her hair blonde in an attempt to fit the role. Barrett sought to surprise Roddenberry at his office, but he walked right past her, not recognizing who she was. It was only when he came back out to give his secretary some papers that he realized it was Barrett. They had the idea that it might get her past the NBC executives and back onto the show. The character of Christine Ducheaux was subsequently changed to Christine Chapel by Roddenberry, as a play on the Sistine Chapel. No other actresses were considered for the role.

At the same time, story editor John D.F. Black wrote the initial script for &quot;The Naked Time&quot;, also early in the first season. The story featured a virus being transmitted among the ship&#x27;s crew, which removed their inhibitions. One element of Black&#x27;s story featured the addition of a nurse in sickbay, working with Doctor Leonard McCoy. Chapel was written into both these episodes by Roddenberry. The deception did not work, with NBC executive Jerry Stanley commenting simply &quot;Well, well – look who&#x27;s back&quot; to Solow. Roddenberry saw to it that the character of Christine Chapel would become a recurring one throughout the series, on-par with Uhura. She remained unsatisfied with the role, but appreciated that since NBC had already fired her once, Roddenberry could not expand the role.

For &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, Barrett was initially set to reprise the role of Chapel as well as voicing Uhura. Likewise James Doohan was to voice both his own Scotty as well as Hikaru Sulu. However, following the intervention of Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols and George Takei were both brought back to voice their own characters. Barrett returned in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; as Chapel, which she described as a &quot;very minimal role&quot;, saying that &quot;If no one had called me Commander Chapel, the audience wouldn&#x27;t really know that I was there.&quot; Barrett said in the film franchise Chapel got lost along the way, not appearing in the second or third films despite her view that she was a main character in &quot;The Original Series&quot;. Nimoy brought back the character for &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, and Barrett was grateful for his decision. The character was subsequently mentioned in the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which saw the characters from &quot;The Original Series&quot; re-cast. Chapel was one of the suggested possibilities for Alice Eve to play in the sequel, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;. It was later revealed that she was portraying Carol Marcus.

In Star Trek: Strange New Worlds the Chapel-character returned to the franchise, this time played by Australian actress Jess Bush. Bush chooses not to use her native Australian accent for the performance, a choice she states that helps her get into character physically and mentally.

In speaking with The Daily Beast in mid-2023 about Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&#x27; LGBTQ+ representation—and her portrayal of a bisexual character—Bush unhesitatingly told the interviewer, &quot;I&#x27;m queer&quot;. Bush said about the role: &quot;I am so delighted that there&#x27;s more representation for all expressions of sexuality and gender in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. That’s really exciting to me, and I’m really proud to be a part of that representation.&quot;

In 2022 Bush was nominated for her role for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Streaming Series.

==Appearances==
In &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;, it is explained that Chapel abandoned a career in bioresearch for a position in Starfleet. She had hoped that this would reunite her with her fiancé Dr. Roger Korby (Michael Strong), incommunicado following his expedition to the planet Exo III. Five years after Korby&#x27;s disappearance, Chapel is assigned to the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; where she serves as head nurse, working under Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley).

While on board the ship, she begins to develop feelings for Spock (Leonard Nimoy), admitting as much in &quot;The Naked Time&quot;. Her actions in that episode resulted in the Psi 2000 intoxication unwittingly being further spread among the crew. The ship reached Exo III in &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;. Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Chapel beam down and discover Korby had been exploiting a sophisticated android manufacturing technology on the planet. After Chapel is horrified to find out that Korby had transplanted his personality into an android replica, he kills himself in despair. Roddenberry later co-wrote in &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot; that the actions of that episode resulted in Chapel breaking her ties to Earth and devoting herself to Starfleet service.

After Korby&#x27;s death, Chapel doubts if she should stay aboard but elects to remain with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; throughout the five-year mission. Chapel&#x27;s feelings for Spock were revisited and alluded to only a few times in the series, most notably in &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot;. In the episode, the Platonians telekinetically force Chapel and Spock to kiss passionately. This humiliates Chapel despite her long-standing feelings for him. In the episode &quot;Amok Time&quot;, she brings Spock some soup to help him through a sacred Vulcan ritual, the Pon farr. He angrily refuses the soup and throws it at the wall, but later thanks Chapel for her thoughtfulness.

Chapel appeared in two of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films featuring &quot;The Original Series&quot; cast. In &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, Chapel had become a doctor on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Her second appearance was in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, where she and Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney) were stationed in Starfleet Headquarters in San Francisco. In the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, a Nurse Chapel is mentioned by McCoy (Karl Urban). In the 2013 film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) tells Kirk (Chris Pine) that after being with him, Chapel left to become a nurse.

Since the start of the &quot;Star Trek: Strange New World&quot; series in 2022, the Chapel character has appeared in all but one of the episodes in the first two seasons.

==Reception==

===Cast and crew===
Executive producer Robert H. Justman did not care for Chapel; he described her as a &quot;wimpy, badly written, and ill-conceived character.&quot; He added that the additional camera lenses used by director Jerry Finnerman in that episode for close-ups of her quivering lip only &quot;served to emphasize the lack of character written into the character.&quot; He had complained to Roddenberry of Barrett&#x27;s acting skills, but stopped when he became aware of their relationship. It was only after Barrett&#x27;s first appearance as Lwaxana Troi in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Haven&quot;, that he came to realize that it was the Chapel character he disliked, not Barrett herself, and told her that his opinion had changed. Barrett also did not care for the character of Chapel, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve never been a real aficionado of Nurse Chapel, I figured she was kind of weak and namby-pamby.&quot;

Writer David Gerrold, who worked with the staff of &quot;The Original Series&quot; following his work on the episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, described Chapel as being one of a second-tier set of characters including Uhura, Scotty, and Sulu, who were not given as much exposure during the series as the main characters of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. He explained that she was the only one of the second level of characters whose motivations were explored, but her primary focus on board the ship was simply to be in love with Spock. Gerrold explained that there was a need to demonstrate the &quot;aloofness&quot; of the Vulcan character, and so this resulted in a character whose love of him needed to be rebuffed, thus giving Chapel her purpose. He suggested that this caused the fandom to dislike Chapel because &quot;female fans saw her as a threat to their own fantasies and male fans saw her as a threat to Spock&#x27;s Vulcan stoicism.&quot; Gerrold added that those fans were surprised when they met Barrett at science fiction conventions, as they found her likable in person. By the time of the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the character had become more popular among fans, who were asking if she would appear in the new films.

===Critical reception===

In her essay &quot;The Audience as Auteur. Women, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &#x27;Vidding&#x27;&quot; in the book &quot;Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s Star Trek: The Original Cast Adventures&quot;, Francesca Coppa said that she saw the switch from Number One to Chapel for Barrett as &quot;degradation on every level: role, status and image&quot;. The role was described as &quot;consolation&quot; in Cary O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s book &quot;June Cleaver Was a Feminist!: Reconsidering the Female Characters of Early Television&quot;, but it was felt that Barrett &quot;made the most of it&quot;. The position of a nurse was described by O&#x27;Dell as a traditional female role, but that Chapel would stand up to McCoy&#x27;s orders when required. Her promotion to Doctor in &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; was praised by author Gladys L. Knight in her book &quot;Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television&quot;.

Reviewers were critical of her relationship with Spock, with Jan Johnson-Smith describing Chapel in &quot;American Science Fiction TV&quot; as &quot;a woman condemned to forever lust after the elusive Vulcan&quot; and noting that she is one of several female characters in the series who are &quot;depicted as recognizable stereotypes&quot;. Coppa also discussed this, calling the character as being a typical damsel in distress, existing &quot;merely to pine&quot;. But the relationship was also seen positively, with Torie Atkinson, at Tor.com, said of Chapel in &quot;Amok Time&quot; that &quot;her affection is so transparent and sweet.&quot; In &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot; by Roddenberry and Stephen E. Whitfield, her feelings toward Spock are said to not be unique since they are shared by many of the female crew on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. It is also further explained that McCoy is aware of her feelings, but displays &quot;fatherly affection&quot; towards her and never &quot;chides&quot; her for this.

Her appearances in episodes were commented on, with Wei Ming Dariotis critical of the single-mindedness of the plot for &quot;Amok Time&quot; in not allowing Spock to have sex with Chapel, or any other woman, and thus solve the problem of his Pon farr. But Eugene Myers at Tor.com praised Chapel, saying that the most interesting part of &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot; was that it was based primarily on her, while Keith DeCandido said that this resulted in the episode being the &quot;Kirk-and-Chapel show&quot; to the detriment of the other characters.

In 2016, Nurse Christine Chapel was ranked as the 60th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, out of 100 characters.

Heavy described Jess Bush&#x27;s latest interpretation of the character as &quot;very different [...] fun, irreverent, and a bit of a live wire.&quot; On the difference between her own portrayal of Chapel and Barrett&#x27;s Bush noted: &quot;I think that when I watched Majel&#x27;s performance, what I distilled most from that, what I took from that, was her candor and her humor and her wit. But those things were just little seedlings. In the 2021 rebirth of her, there&#x27;s so much more to her, I think. [...] She&#x27;s got this lust for life and this mischievous nature that I love to embody. She&#x27;s been through some stuff, actually.

<doc id="404150" wikidata="Q1487159" url="?curid=404150" title="Harry Gordon Selfridge">
<text>Harry Gordon Selfridge, Sr. (11 January 1858 – 8 May 1947) was an American retail magnate who founded the London-based department store Selfridges. The early years of his leadership of Selfridges led to his becoming one of the most respected and wealthy retail magnates in the United Kingdom. He was known as the &#x27;Earl of Oxford Street&#x27;.

Born in Ripon, Wisconsin, and raised in Jackson, Michigan, Selfridge delivered newspapers and left school at 14 when he found work at a local bank. Selfridge eventually obtained a stock boy position at Marshall Field&#x27;s department store in Chicago, where over the next 25 years, he rose to become a partner. In 1890, he married the wealthy Rose Buckingham who was from a prominent Chicago family.

In 1906, following a trip to London, Selfridge invested £400,000 to build a new department store in what was then the unfashionable western end of Oxford Street. Selfridges opened to the public on 15 March 1909, and Selfridge remained chairman until 1941.

==Early life==
Selfridge was born to Robert Oliver Selfridge and Lois Frances Selfridge (née Baxter) in Ripon, Wisconsin, on 11 January 1858, one of three boys. Within months of his birth, the family moved to Jackson, Michigan, as his father had acquired the town&#x27;s general store. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, his father joined the Union Army. He rose to the rank of major, before being honorably discharged. However, he abandoned his family, not returning home after the war ended.

This left his wife Lois to bring up three young boys. Selfridge&#x27;s two brothers died at a very young age shortly after the war ended, so Harry became his mother&#x27;s only child. She found work as a schoolteacher and struggled financially to support both of them. She supplemented her low income by painting greeting cards, and eventually became headmistress of Jackson High School. Selfridge and his mother enjoyed each other&#x27;s company and were good friends; she lived with him and his family until her death in 1924.

==Career==

At the age of 10, Selfridge began to contribute to the family income by delivering newspapers. Aged 12, he started working at the Leonard Field&#x27;s dry-goods store. This allowed him to fund the creation of a boys&#x27; monthly magazine with schoolfriend Peter Loomis, making money from the advertising carried within.

Selfridge left school at 14 and found work at a bank in Jackson. After failing his entrance examinations to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Selfridge became a bookkeeper at the local furniture factory of Gilbert, Ransom &amp; Knapp. However, the company closed four months later, and Selfridge moved to Grand Rapids to work in the insurance industry.

In 1876, his ex-employer, Leonard Field, agreed to write Selfridge a letter of introduction to Marshall Field in Chicago, who was a senior partner in Field, Leiter &amp; Company, one of the most successful stores in the city (which soon became Marshall Field and Company). Initially employed as a stock boy in the wholesale department, over the following 25 years, Selfridge worked his way up. He was eventually appointed a junior partner, married Rosalie Buckingham (of the prominent Chicago Buckinghams) and amassed a considerable personal fortune.

After their marriage, the couple lived for some time with Rose&#x27;s mother on Rush Street in Chicago. They later moved to their own home on Lake Shore Drive. The Selfridges also built an imposing mansion called Harrose Hall in mock Tudor style on Geneva Lake in Wisconsin, complete with large greenhouses and extensive rose gardens. Over the next decade, the couple had five children: 
*Chandler Selfridge (b and d 7 August 1891)
*Rosalie Selfridge (10 September 1893 – October 1977) – she married Serge Vincent de Bolotoff, Prince Wiasemsky on 7 August 1918.
*Violette Selfridge (5 June 1897 – 1996) – she married Jacques Jean de Sibour on 4 May 1921 and they were divorced in February 1949. 
*Gordon Selfridge (2 April 1900 – 30 November 1976) – he married Charlotte Elsie Dennis on 10 June 1940. 
*Beatrice Selfridge (30 July 1901 – 1990) – she married twice; first to Comte Louis de Sibour and then to Frank L. Lewis

Throughout their married life, Harry&#x27;s mother, Lois, lived with the family. While at Marshall Field, Selfridge was the first to promote Christmas sales with the phrase &quot;Only _____ Shopping Days Until Christmas&quot;, a catchphrase that was quickly picked up by retailers in other markets. Selfridge or Marshall Field are usually cited as the originators of the phrase &quot;The customer is always right.&quot;

In 1904, Harry opened his own department store called Harry G. Selfridge and Co. in Chicago. However, after only two months he sold the store at a profit to Carson, Pirie and Co. He then decided to retire, and for the next two years puttered around his properties, mainly Harrose Hall. He also bought a steam yacht, which he rarely used, and played golf.

===London and the Selfridges department store===
In 1906, when Selfridge travelled to London on holiday with his wife, he noticed that although the city was a cultural and commercial leader, its stores could not rival Field&#x27;s in Chicago or the great galleries of Parisian department stores.

Recognizing a gap in the market, Selfridge, who had become bored with retirement, decided to invest £400,000 in a new department store of his own, locating it in what was then the unfashionable western end of London&#x27;s Oxford Street but which was opposite an entrance to the Bond Street tube station. The new store opened to the public on 15 March 1909, setting new standards for the retailing business.

Selfridge promoted the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity. The store was extensively promoted through advertising. The shop floors were structured so that goods could be made more accessible to customers. There were elegant restaurants with modest prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms for French, German, American and &quot;Colonial&quot; customers, a First Aid Room, and a Silence Room, with soft lights, deep chairs, and double-glazing, all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible. Staff members were taught to be on hand to &quot;assist&quot; customers, but not too aggressively, and to &quot;sell&quot; the merchandise. Oliver Lyttelton observed that, when one called on Selfridge, he would have nothing on his desk except one&#x27;s letter, smoothed and ironed.

Selfridge also managed to obtain from the GPO the privilege of having the number &quot;1&quot; as its own phone number, so anybody had to just ask the operator for Gerrard 1 to be connected to Selfridge&#x27;s operators. In 1909, Selfridge proposed a subway link to Bond Street station; however, contemporaneous opposition quashed the idea.

Selfridge&#x27;s prospered during World War I and up to the mid-1930s. The Great Depression was already taking its toll on Selfridge&#x27;s retail business and his lavish spending had run up a £150,000 debt to his store. He became a British subject in 1937. By 1940, he owed £250,000 in taxes and was in debt to the bank. In his 80s, the Selfridges board forced him out in 1941. In 1951, the original Oxford Street Selfridges was acquired by the Liverpool-based Lewis&#x27;s chain of department stores, which was in turn taken over in 1965 by the Sears Group owned by Charles Clore. Expanded under the Sears group to include branches in Manchester and Birmingham, in 2003 the chain was acquired by Canada&#x27;s Galen Weston for £598 million.

==Personal life==
In 1890, Selfridge married Rosalie &quot;Rose&quot; Buckingham of the prominent Buckingham family of Chicago. Her father was Benjamin Hale Buckingham, who was a member of a very successful family, with a real estate business established by her grandfather, Alvah Buckingham. At 30 years old, Rose was a successful property developer, having inherited money and expertise from her family. Rose had purchased land in Harper Ave, Hyde Park, Chicago and built 42 villas and artists cottages within a landscaped environment. The couple had five children: three girls and two boys (though their first son died soon after birth).

At the height of his success, Selfridge leased Highcliffe Castle in Hampshire, from Major General Edward James Montagu-Stuart-Wortley. In addition, he purchased Hengistbury Head, a mile-long promontory on England&#x27;s southern coast, where he planned to build a magnificent castle; these plans never got off the drawing board, however, and in 1930 the Head was put up for sale. Although only a tenant at Highcliffe, he set about fitting modern bathrooms, installing steam central heating and building and equipping a modern kitchen. During World War I, Rose opened a tented retreat at Highcliffe called the &quot;Mrs Gordon Selfridge Convalescent Camp for American Soldiers&quot; on the castle grounds. Selfridge gave up the lease in 1922.

Selfridge&#x27;s wife Rose died during the influenza pandemic of 1918; his mother, who lived with them, died in 1924. As a widower, Selfridge had numerous liaisons, including those with the celebrated Dolly Sisters and the divorcée Syrie Barnardo Wellcome, who would later become better known as the decorator Syrie Maugham. He also began and maintained a busy social life and entertained lavishly both at his home in Lansdowne House, located at 9 Fitzmaurice Place, Mayfair, just off Berkeley Square, and on his private yacht, the SY &quot;Conqueror&quot;, with VIP guests such as Rudyard Kipling cruising the Mediterranean. Lansdowne House displays a blue plaque noting that Gordon Selfridge lived there from 1921 to 1929.

==Later life and death==
During the years of the Great Depression, Selfridge&#x27;s fortune rapidly declined and then disappeared—a situation not helped by his free-spending ways. He gambled frequently and often lost. He also spent money on various showgirls.

On 8 May 1947, Selfridge died of bronchial pneumonia at his home in Putney, south-west London, aged 89. His funeral was held on 12 May at St. Mark&#x27;s Church in Highcliffe, after which he was buried in St Mark&#x27;s Churchyard next to his wife and his mother.

Selfridge&#x27;s children were Chandler, who died shortly after birth; Rosalie, who married Serge de Bolotoff, later Wiasemsky; Violette (who wrote the book &quot;Flying gypsies: the chronicle of a 10,000-mile air vagabondage&quot; and married first Vicomte Jacques Jean de Sibour and second Frederick T. Bedford); Harry Jr. &quot;Gordon&quot;; and Beatrice. 
Selfridge&#x27;s grandson, Oliver, who died in 2008, became a pioneer in artificial intelligence. His grandson Ralph, who also died in 2008, was a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Florida from 1961 to 2002 and was called by many &quot;the grandfather of digital simulation.&quot;

==Writings==
Selfridge wrote a book, &quot;The Romance of Commerce&quot;, published by John Lane—The Bodley Head, in 1918, but actually written several years prior. In it are chapters on ancient commerce, China, Greece, Venice, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, the Fugger family, the Hanseatic League, fairs, guilds, early British commerce, trade and the Tudors, the East India Company, north England&#x27;s merchants, the growth of trade, trade and the aristocracy, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Japan, and representative businesses of the 20th century.

Among the more popular quotations attributed to Selfridge:

* &quot;The customer is always right.&quot;
* &quot;People will sit up and take notice of you if you will sit up and take notice of what makes them sit up and take notice.&quot;
* &quot;The boss drives his men; the leader coaches them.&quot;
* &quot;The boss depends upon authority, the leader on goodwill.&quot;
* &quot;The boss inspires fear; the leader inspires enthusiasm.&quot;
* &quot;The boss says &#x27;I&#x27;; the leader, &#x27;we&#x27;.&quot;
* &quot;The boss fixes the blame for the breakdown; the leader fixes the breakdown.&quot;
* &quot;The boss knows how it is done; the leader shows how.&quot;
* &quot;The boss says &#x27;Go&#x27;; the leader says &#x27;Let&#x27;s go!&#x27;&quot;

==Television==
The British period television drama series &quot;Mr Selfridge&quot; began its first season in 2013, starring Jeremy Piven as Harry Gordon Selfridge.

&quot;Secrets of Selfridges&quot;, produced by the independent UK company Pioneer Productions in its &quot;Secrets of Britain&quot; series, was an hour-long documentary about the London store and Harry Selfridge.

==Notes==
:1.Other sources, including the Selfridges company history, place his birthdate in 1856, 1857 or as late as 1864.

<doc id="404157" wikidata="Q117266977" url="?curid=404157" title="Ruby-crowned kinglet">
<text>The ruby-crowned kinglet (Corthylio calendula) is a very small passerine bird found throughout North America. It is a member of the kinglet family. The bird has olive-green plumage with two white wing bars and a white eye-ring. Males have a red crown patch, which is often concealed. The sexes are identical apart from the crown, and juveniles are similar in plumage to adult females. It is one of the smallest songbirds in North America. The ruby-crowned kinglet is not closely related to other kinglets and was moved from &quot;Regulus&quot; to its own genus, &quot;Corthylio&quot; in 2021. Three subspecies are currently recognized.

The kinglet is mostly migratory, and its range extends from northwest Canada and Alaska south to Mexico. Its breeding habitat is spruce-fir forests in the northern and mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. The ruby-crowned kinglet builds a cup-shaped nest, which may be pensile or placed on a tree branch and is often hidden. It lays up to 12 eggs, and has the largest clutch of any North American passerine for its size. It is mainly insectivorous, but also eats fruits and seeds.

==Taxonomy==
The ruby-crowned kinglet was formally described in 1766 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla calendula&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on &quot;The Ruby-crowned wren&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1758 by English naturalist George Edwards in his &quot;Gleanings of Natural History&quot;. Edwards had received dried specimens sent by the American naturalist William Bartram from Pennsylvania. The French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 had also published a description based on Edwards and had coined the Latin name &quot;Calendula Pensilvanica&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Linnaeus specified the locality as Pennsylvania but this is now restricted to Philadelphia.

The kinglets are a small group of birds formerly included in the Old World warblers, but now given family status, especially as recent research showed that, despite superficial similarities, the crests are taxonomically remote from the warblers.

The ruby-crowned kinglet was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Regulus&quot;. As a result of its larger size, strongly red (rather than orange or yellow) crest and lack of black crown stripes, as well as its distinctive vocalisations, the ruby-crowned kinglet is considered different enough from the Old World kinglets and the other American species, the golden-crowned kinglet, to be assigned to a separate genus, &quot;Corthylio&quot;, that was introduced in 1853 by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;korthúlos&quot;, a small wren-like bird mentioned by the Greek lexicographer Hesychius of Alexandria. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that the ruby-crowned kinglet&#x27;s lineage diverged from the rest of &quot;Regulus&quot; during the mid- to late Miocene, about 10–15 million years ago.

Up to five subspecies have been described, but &quot;&quot;C. c. cineraceus&quot;, breeding in montane western North America, and &quot;C. c. arizonensis&quot;&quot;, breeding in Arizona, are considered to be clinal variants of the nominate subspecies.

The three subspecies are:
* &quot;C. c. grinnellii&quot; (Palmer, W, 1897) – Breeds in southeast Alaska (described from Sitka, Alaska), southwestern Canada and northwestern U.S., in coastal temperate rainforest. Resident or only a short-distant migrant wintering in western U.S. Darker, and shorter-winged than &quot;C. c. calendula&quot;.
* &quot;C. c. calendula&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – Breeds in central, eastern Canada and southwestern, west-central, eastern U.S. Winters in northern Central America
* &quot;C. c. obscurus&quot; (Ridgway, 1876) – Endemic on Guadalupe Island off the coast of northwestern Mexico. Darker, with a larger bill, and shorter wings and tail than &quot;C. c. calendula&quot;. Resident.

== Description ==
The ruby-crowned kinglet is a very small bird, being long, having a wingspan of , and weighing . It has gray-green upperparts and olive-buff underparts. It has two white wingbars and a broken white eye ring. The wingbar on the greater secondary coverts (closer to the wing-tip) is wider, and is next to a dark band. The kinglet has a relatively plain face and head, although the male has a scarlet-red crown patch, which is usually concealed by the surrounding feathers. The crown patch is rarely orange, yellow, or not present. Females are identical to males (except for the crown). Immature birds are similar to adult females, since young males lack a crown patch. The kinglet usually moves along branches or through foliage with short hops, and flies with bursts of rapid wing beats. It is constantly active, and is easily recognized by its characteristic wing-flicking. Its flight has been described as &quot;swift, jerky, and erratic&quot;.

Compared to the related golden-crowned kinglet, the ruby-crowned kinglet is slightly larger, more elongated, and has greener plumage. The bird can be mistaken for Hutton&#x27;s vireo, which also displays wing-flicking, though less frequently than the kinglet. It can also be mistaken for the dwarf vireo in Mexico. However, both of the vireos are larger, have stouter bills and legs, and lack the kinglet&#x27;s black bar on the wings.
===Vocalization===
The ruby-crowned kinglet&#x27;s vocalizations are remarkably loud and complex for its size. Its song can be divided into three main parts: a series of high pitched notes (&quot;zee-zee-zee&quot; or &quot;tee-tee-tee&quot;), two to five low trills (&quot;turr&quot; or &quot;tu&quot;), and a repeated three note &quot;galloping&quot; phrase (&quot;tee-da-leet&quot;, &quot;tee-da-leet&quot;). However, there is variation in the songs of a given individual, and they often contain only one or two of the three parts. The third part is only sung by male birds; an abbreviated version is heard from the females. Other vocalizations of the ruby-crowned kinglet include alarm calls, simple contact calls, and begging calls produced by chicks.

The subspecies &quot;C. c. grinnellii&quot;, breeding from southeastern Alaska to British Columbia differs significantly from the nominate &quot;calendula&quot;, and so is considered to represent a valid subspecies: it is smaller and shorter-winged, its upperparts are darker and greener, its underparts are buffy rather than grayish-olive, and the vent is tinged yellow rather than dull whitish-olive.

The subspecies &quot;C. c. obscurus&quot;, from Guadalupe Island, off Baja California, is considered endangered, and may already be extinct.

Hybridization with golden-crowned kinglets has been reported to have possibly occurred.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Their breeding habitat is coniferous forests across Canada, Alaska, northern New England and the western United States. They nest in a well-concealed hanging cup suspended from a conifer branch and may lay as many as twelve eggs in a clutch.

The recent counting indicates that the ruby-crowned kinglet population is on the rise. This is mainly due to discovery of less disturbed territory farther north. This allows more successful breeding.

These birds migrate to the southern United States and Mexico. Some birds are permanent residents in the west.

== Behaviour ==

Ruby-crowned kinglets forage actively in trees or shrubs, mainly eating small insects and spiders, some berries and tree sap. They may hover over a branch while feeding and sometimes fly out to catch insects in flight. The red crest is raised when agitated or in display. Often, they perform a &quot;broken-wing&quot; act to draw predators away from their nest, which they will defend fearlessly, mobbing the intruder which may be a cat, squirrel, or human.

<text>Joseph Aloysius Hansom (26 October 1803 – 29 June 1882) was a British architect working principally in the Gothic Revival style. He invented the Hansom cab and founded the eminent architectural journal &quot;The Builder&quot; in 1843.

== Career ==
Hansom was born in the parish of St Martin&#x27;s (possibly on St Martin&#x27;s Lane), York to a large Roman Catholic family and baptised as Josephus Aloysius Handsom(e). He was the brother of the architect Charles Francis Hansom and the uncle of Edward J. Hansom. He was apprenticed to his father, Henry, as a joiner, but showing an early aptitude for draughtsmanship and construction, he transferred his apprenticeship to a York architect named Matthew Philips, without informing the City of York. By around 1823 he had completed his apprenticeship and became a clerk in Philips&#x27; office.

About 1825 he settled in Halifax, Yorkshire, and in the same year he married Hannah Glover, the elder sister of the architect George Glover (1812–1890), at St Michael le Belfrey in York. He took a post as assistant to John Oates and there befriended the brothers John and Edward Welch, with whom he formed his first architectural partnership (Handsom &amp; Welch) in 1828. Together they designed several churches in Yorkshire and Liverpool, and also worked on the renovation of Bodelwyddan Castle in Denbighshire and King William&#x27;s College in the Isle of Man. In 1831 their designs for Birmingham Town Hall were accepted; however, the contract led to their bankruptcy, as they had stood surety for the builders. The disaster led to the dissolution of the partnership.

Hansom supported the views of social reformers Robert Owen and Thomas Attwood, and the Operative Builders Union, which was formed in 1831/3, which led to some viewing him as a socialist.

On 23 December 1834 he registered the design of a &#x27;Patent Safety Cab&#x27; on the suggestion of his employer. Distinctive safety features included a suspended axle, while the larger wheels and lower position of the cab led to less wear and tear and fewer accidents. He went on to sell the patent to a company for £10,000; however, as a result of the purchaser&#x27;s financial difficulties, the sum was never paid. The first Hansom Cab travelled down Hinckley&#x27;s Coventry Road in 1835. The Hansom cab was improved by subsequent modifications and exported worldwide to become a ubiquitous feature of the 19th-century street scene.

In 1843 Hansom founded a new architectural journal known as &quot;The Builder&quot;, another venture which was to flourish through the century; renamed &quot;Building&quot; in 1966, it continues to this day. However, neither he nor his partner Alfred Bartholomew (1801–45) profited from the enterprise, because they were compelled to retire for lack of capital.

Between 1854 and 1879 Hansom devoted himself to architecture, designing and erecting a great number of important buildings, private and public, including numerous churches, schools and convents for the Roman Catholic Church. Buildings from his designs are to be found all over the United Kingdom, as well as in Australia and South America.

Hansom practised in a succession of architectural partnerships. From 1847 to 1852 he practised in Preston, Lancashire, working briefly in association with Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin towards the end of the latter&#x27;s life. After the practice moved to London, he took his brother Charles Francis Hansom into partnership in 1854. But this partnership was dissolved in 1859 when Charles established an independent practice in Bath with his son Edward Joseph Hansom as clerk.

In 1862 Joseph Hansom formed a partnership with Edward Welby Pugin, which broke up acrimoniously in 1863. Finally, in 1869, he took his son Joseph Stanislaus Hansom into partnership.

Hansom lived at 27 Sumner Place, South Kensington, London, and there is a blue plaque there in his memory.

Hansom moved to manage an estate at Caldecote Hall. He retired on 31 December 1879 and died at 399 Fulham Road, London, on 29 June 1882.

== Surviving works ==
Hansom designed around 200 buildings, including Birmingham Town Hall; Arundel Cathedral; Oxford Oratory; Cathedral of St John the Evangelist, Portsmouth; St George&#x27;s Catholic Church in York; Mount St Mary&#x27;s Church, the &#x27;Famine Church&#x27; in Leeds; St Walburge&#x27;s Church in Preston (with the tallest church spire in England); Church of the Immaculate Conception, Spinkhill in 1846; St Beuno&#x27;s Jesuit Theologate in North Wales (1848); St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hartlepool in 1850; the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady, Torquay, St Mary&#x27;s Church, Madeley, and St David&#x27;s Church, Dalkeith, in 1853; Annunciation Church, Chesterfield and St Mary&#x27;s Star of the Sea Church, Leith, Edinburgh in 1854; St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Leigh in 1855; St Duthac&#x27;s, Dornie, Ross and Cromartie, 1860; St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church, Ripon in 1862; Our Lady the Immaculate Conception Church in Devizes, Wiltshire (opened 1865); Our Lady Help of Christians and St Denis Church, Torquay, in 1869; St Edward King and Confessor Catholic Church, Clifford; the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus, Manchester (1871); The Roman Catholic Plymouth Cathedral (built 1856 – 1858); and Our Lady of Dolours, Chelsea with St Mary&#x27;s Priory, Fulham Road (1876). The Exhibition Hall Theatre, Ushaw Historic House, County Durham (1849 – 1851) In Leicester, the Leicester Museum &amp; Art Gallery building, formerly New Walk Proprietary School (1836), and a Baptist chapel (1845), later used as the town&#x27;s central library, are in Hansom&#x27;s Classical style, and he also designed Lutterworth Town Hall (1836). In Cornwall he designed the Roman Catholic churches of Falmouth and Liskeard. St Clare&#x27;s Abbey, Darlington (1856).

<doc id="404166" wikidata="Q127212" url="?curid=404166" title="Berkeley Square">
<text>Berkeley Square is a garden square in the West End of London. It is one of the best known of the many squares in London, located in Mayfair in the City of Westminster. It was laid out in the mid 18th century by the architect William Kent, and originally extended further south. The garden&#x27;s very large London Plane trees are among the oldest in central London, planted in 1789.

== Description ==
===Buildings===
Like most squares in British cities, it is surrounded largely by terraced houses, in this case grand townhouses. Originally these were the London residences of very wealthy families who would spend most of the year at their country house. Only one building, number 48, remains wholly residential. Most have been converted into offices for businesses typical of Mayfair, such as bluechips&#x27; meeting spaces, hedge funds, niche headhunters and wealth management businesses.

The buildings&#x27; architects included Robert Adam but 9 Fitzmaurice Place (since 1935 home of the Lansdowne Club, earlier known as Shelb(o)urne then Lansdowne House — all three names referring to the same branch of one family) is now on the south corner&#x27;s approach (&quot;Fitzmaurice Place&quot;). The daring staircase-hall of No.44 is sometimes considered William Kent&#x27;s masterpiece. Gunter&#x27;s Tea Shop, founded under a different name in 1757, used to trade here.

Approach ways include Berkeley Street, Curzon Street, and Hill Street.

===Gardens===
The gardens of Berkeley Square are Grade II listed (are in the initial category) on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. They are plain from the horticultural point of view, with grass and paths, but dominated by a group of London Plane trees around the gardens, planted in 1789, the year of the French Revolution.

In 2008, one of the trees was said to be the &quot;most valuable street tree in Britain&quot; by the London Tree Officers Association, in terms of its size, health, historical significance and the number of people who live near to it. One in the south-west corner is a Great Tree of London.

The square features a sculptural fountain by Alexander Munro, a Pre-Raphaelite sculptor, made in 1865. The fountain was donated by the third Marquess of Lansdowne, and replaced a statue of George II which was removed in 1827. On the eastern side is a bronze sculpture of Velasquez&#x27; Reina Mariana by Manolo Valdes.

==History==
The square was originally the bottom of the large garden of Berkeley House on Piccadilly, subsequently Devonshire House. In 1696, John Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley of Stratton, sold the house and much of the garden to William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire, but retained a significant area at the bottom, including the site of Berkeley Square.

The square is among those that demonstrate non-waiver of (no later agreement to forego) restrictive covenants. In 1696, with express intent to bind later owners, Berkeley undertook not to build on land retained very directly behind the house, so preserving the view from the rear of the ducal residence. The southernmost portion saw either a breach and passage of 20 years without claim (the limitation period of deeds) or a release of covenant agreement struck up – it was until about 1930 legally required green space, namely gardens of 9 Fitzmaurice Place. They became the new south side of the square.

<doc id="404168" wikidata="Q1306976" url="?curid=404168" title="Anting (behavior)">
<text>Anting is a maintenance behavior during which birds rub insects, usually ants, on their feathers and skin. The bird may pick up the insects in its bill and rub them on the body (active anting), or the bird may lie in an area of high density of the insects and perform dust bathing-like movements (passive anting). The insects secrete liquids containing chemicals such as formic acid, which can act as an insecticide, miticide, fungicide, or bactericide. Alternatively, anting could make the insects edible by removing the distasteful acid, or possibly supplement the bird&#x27;s own preen oil. Instead of ants, birds can also use millipedes. More than 200 species of bird are known to ant. A possibly related behaviour, self-anointing, is seen in many mammals.

==History==

The first scientific writings of this behaviour dates back to 1831. American ornithologist John James Audubon described wild juvenile turkeys that &quot;wallowed&quot; in abandoned ant hills. Another description was published by a naturalist in 1847 in a manuscript called &quot;Bird of Jamaica&quot;. In it the author describes how ants remove parasites from a tame crow, while the crow is foraging for food. In 1934 an Alexander Hugh Chisholm described in &quot;Bird Wonders of Australia&quot;, a strange relationship birds had with ants. The behaviour was described by Erwin Stresemann in German as &quot;Einemsen&quot; in the German ornithology journal &quot;Ornithologische Monatsberichte&quot; (Volume XLIII, p. 138) in 1935. Indian ornithologist Salim Ali interpreted an observation by his cousin Humayun Abdulali in the 1936 volume of &quot;Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society&quot; and included a reference to the Stresemann&#x27;s paper suggesting that the German term could be translated into English as &quot;anting&quot;.

==Modes==
=== Active ===

Anting most commonly occurs on the ground but in some species, birds practice anting on tree branches. A bird will place the tip of its wing on the ground and rub its bill containing an ant from the tip of the wing up. The tail is usually tucked between the legs and under the body, which results in the bird being unstable. Birds use one ant at a time and only rub a feather once with an ant. However, there are some cases where an ant is used more than once but never exceeds three uses. There are some exceptions to this as starlings often take a ball of ants in their bills to be used for anting. Active anting happens very quickly and can often be mistaken for regular feather maintenance. This type of anting can last anywhere from just several minutes to half an hour. Most species of birds practice active anting and do this individually or in small groups. Birds may also use &#x27;substitutes&#x27; in active anting. Birds have been seen to use snails, grasshoppers, amphipods and even larvae.

=== Passive ===
Passive anting occurs when a bird rubs its wings and tail on an anthill. Once a bird has found an anthill it will then spread both of its wings forward at the same time. It will then sit on its tails which attracts the ants. Once the ants are on their wing feathers they provoke the ants by rubbing their head or beak through their feathers where the ants are. To prevent ants from crawling onto a bird&#x27;s head or beak the bird will shake its head very quickly. The birds allow the ants to roam freely around its feathers. This type of anting is less common and is mostly seen in robins and ravens.

== Functions ==

=== Ridding of ectoparasites ===
Anting to get rid of ectoparasites is one hypothesis for anting in songbirds. This hypothesis suggests that birds use the chemical secretions that come from ants to control and get rid of parasites in their feathers. Microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi can destroy a bird&#x27;s feathers if their numbers get large enough. Formic acid is a commonly produced chemical by ants, and it was found to inhibit growth of feather-destroying microorganisms. However, there is little evidence that chemicals from ants help to remove or deter other parasites such as feather lice and mites.

=== Feather grooming ===

The hypothesis that anting is a form of feather maintenance suggests that anting brings saliva to the bird&#x27;s feathers for use in preening. This helps to remove old preen oil and other substances.

=== Food preparation ===
The food preparation hypothesis suggests that birds rub the ant in its feathers to remove a substance on the ant. Ants produce formic acid as an anti-predator adaptation. Thus, when an ant feels threatened, as when in the beak of a bird, it will spray formic acid. It is suggested that birds then rub the ants in their feathers to remove the harmful formic acid. The bird will then ingest the ant. This can be seen in European starlings, &quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;.

=== Sensory self-stimulation ===
Anting has been compared to human activities such as smoking and other external stimuli that serve no biological purpose and is just for self-stimulation. This hypothesis has been suggested as anting has no obvious function, it is non-adaptive, birds are said to achieve pleasure from anting and anting has characteristics of a habit. However, there is no definitive evidence that sensory self-stimulation is the purpose of anting in birds. There have been several studies that claim to prove this hypothesis while others say just the opposite.

=== Functions in molt ===
It has been found that passerine birds molt in the summer months. These birds often focus much of the anting on their wings and tails. This is where the largest feathers emerge, and it has been suggested that anting helps stimulate the growth of these feathers during molt. Not all birds that ant do so during molt.

== Species of ants used ==
Ants that spray and produce formic acid for defense are used for anting more often than species which do not spray or produce formic acid. Species from the subfamily Formicinae are the most commonly chosen by birds. Species from Dolichoderinae and Myrmicinae subfamilies are also used for anting however, not as common as Formicinae. If given a choice a bird will choose an ant in the subfamily Formicinae over all other species. In total there are 24 ant species birds use for anting.

== Substitutes of ants ==
Some birds participate in this anting behaviour but with other organisms and even objects. Some of the organisms birds use are garlic snails, amphipods, millipedes, dermapterans, caterpillars, grasshoppers, hemipterans, mealworm larvae, and wasps.

==Related behaviours==

Dusting with soil from ant-hills has been considered by some as equivalent to anting.

Some birds like antbirds and flickers not only ant, but also consume the ants as an important part of their diet. Other opportunist ant-eating birds include sparrows, wrens, grouse and starlings. European honey-buzzards have been found to gather fresh maple branches on the ground and then spread themselves over it and it has been suggested that this might be a case of tool-use to attract ants for anting.

Similar to anting may be the observed habit some birds show of picking up cigarette butts, sometimes lit, and rubbing themselves with them.

<text>123 Democratic Alliance (Chinese: 一二三民主聯盟) was a pro-Kuomintang political party in Hong Kong. Established in 1994 by a group of pro-Taiwan, pro-democracy and pro-business politicians, it aims at striving for the unification of China, to strive for a free, democratic, and wealthy China, and to establish a democratic and prosperous Hong Kong. It remained a small party until it was dissolved in 2000 due to the lack of financial support from the Taiwan government, after the Kuomintang&#x27;s defeat in the presidential election.

==History==
The party was formed by the supporters of the Kuomintang government on Taiwan in 1994. It was represented by Sin Ling Yum in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) from 1995 to 1997. It was excluded from the Provisional Legislative Council, the interim body which largely controlled by the Beijing government. All candidates were defeated in the 1998 LegCo elections.

The party won six seats in the 1999 District Council elections. Due to lack of funding, the party did not file any candidates in the 2000 LegCo elections (although some of the losers continued to take part as independent participants or supporters of other parties), and was subsequently dissolved on 3 December 2000 due to the lack of financial support from the Taiwan government. The last chairman of the alliance was Tai Cheuk-yin.

<doc id="404170" wikidata="Q855048" url="?curid=404170" title="Koku">
<text>The is a Chinese-based Japanese unit of volume. 1 koku is equivalent to 10 or approximately , or about of rice. It converts, in turn, to 100 shō and 1000 gō. One &quot;gō&quot; is the traditional volume of a single serving of rice (before cooking), used to this day for the plastic measuring cup that is supplied with commercial Japanese rice cookers.

The &quot;koku&quot; in Japan was typically used as a dry measure. The amount of rice production measured in &quot;koku&quot; was the metric by which the magnitude of a feudal domain (&quot;han&quot;) was evaluated. A feudal lord was only considered &quot;daimyō&quot; class when his domain amounted to at least 10,000 &quot;koku&quot;. As a rule of thumb, one &quot;koku&quot; was considered a sufficient quantity of rice to feed one person for one year.

The Chinese equivalent or cognate unit for capacity is the shi or dan () also known as hu (), now approximately 103 litres but historically about .

== Chinese equivalent ==
The Chinese dan is equal to 10 &quot;dou&quot; () &quot;pecks&quot;, 100 &quot;sheng&quot; () &quot;pints&quot;. While the current &quot;dan&quot; is 103 litres in volume, the &quot;dan&quot; of the Tang dynasty (618–907) period equalled 59.44 litres.

== Modern unit ==
The exact modern is calculated to be 180.39 litres, 100 times the capacity of a modern . This modern is essentially defined to be the same as the from the Edo period (1600–1868), namely 100 times the equal to 64827 cubic in the traditional measuring system.

=== Origin of the modern unit ===
The , the semi-official one measuring box since the late 16th century under Daimyo Nobunaga, began to be made in a different (larger) size in the early Edo period, sometime during the 1620s. Its dimensions, given in the traditional Japanese length unit system, were 4 9 square times 2 7 depth. Its volume, which could be calculated by multiplication was:
1 = 100 = 100 × (49 × 49 × 27 ) = 100 × 64,827 cubic 
Although this was referred to as or the &quot;new&quot; measuring cup in its early days, its use supplanted the old measure in most areas in Japan, until the only place still left using the old cup (&quot;&quot;) was the city of Edo, and the Edo government passed an edict declaring the the official nationwide measure standard in 1669 (Kanbun 9).

=== Modern measurement enactment ===
When the 1891 Japanese was promulgated, it defined the unit as the capacity of the standard of 64827 cubic . The same act also defined the length as metre. The metric equivalent of the modern is litres. The modern is therefore litres, or 180.39 litres.

The modern defined here is set to equal the so-called ( or &quot;compromise &quot;), measuring 302.97 mm, a middle-ground value between two different standards. A researcher has pointed out that the () cups ought to have used which were 0.2% longer. However, the actual measuring cups in use did not quite attain the metric, and when the Japanese Ministry of Finance had collected actual samples of from the (measuring-cup guilds) of both eastern and western Japan, they found that the measurements were close to the average of and .

=== Lumber koku ===
The &quot;lumber &quot; or &quot;maritime &quot; is defined as equal to 10 cubic  in the lumber or shipping industry, compared with the standard measures 6.48 cubic . A lumber is conventionally accepted as equivalent to 120 board feet, but in practice may convert to less. In metric measures 1 lumber is about .

== Historic use ==

The exact measure now in use was devised around the 1620s, but not officially adopted for all of Japan until the Kanbun era (1660s).

=== Feudal Japan ===

Under the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1868) of the Edo period of Japanese history, each feudal domain had an assessment of its potential income known as &quot;kokudaka&quot; (production yield) which in part determined its order of precedence at the Shogunal court. The smallest &quot;kokudaka&quot; to qualify the fief-holder for the title of &quot;daimyō&quot; was 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; (worth ) and Kaga han, the largest fief (other than that of the &quot;shōgun&quot;), was called the &quot;million-&quot;koku&quot; domain&quot;. Its holdings totaled around 1,025,000 &quot;koku&quot; (worth ). Many samurai, including &quot;hatamoto&quot; (a high-ranking samurai), received stipends in &quot;koku&quot;, while a few received salaries instead.

The &quot;kokudaka&quot; was reported in terms of brown rice (&quot;genmai&quot;) in most places, with the exception of the land ruled by the Satsuma clan which reported in terms of unhusked or non-winnowed rice (. Since this practice had persisted, past Japanese rice production statistics need to be adjusted for comparison with other countries that report production by milled or polished rice.

Even in certain parts of the Tōhoku region or Ezo (Hokkaidō), where rice could not be grown, the economy was still measured in terms of &quot;koku&quot;, with other crops and produce converted to their equivalent value in terms of rice. The &quot;kokudaka&quot; was not adjusted from year to year, and thus some fiefs had larger economies than their nominal &quot;koku&quot; indicated, due to land reclamation and new rice field development, which allowed them to fund development projects.

==== As measure of cargo ship class ====
&quot;Koku&quot; was also used to measure how much a ship could carry when all its loads were rice. Smaller ships carried 50 &quot;koku&quot; () while the biggest ships carried over 1,000 &quot;koku&quot; (). The biggest ships were larger than military vessels owned by the shogunate.

== In popular culture ==
The Hyakumangoku Matsuri (Million-&quot;Koku&quot; Festival) in Kanazawa, Japan celebrates the arrival of &quot;daimyō&quot; Maeda Toshiie into the city in 1583, although Maeda&#x27;s income was not raised to over a million &quot;koku&quot; until after the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600.

== In fiction ==
The James Clavell novel Shōgun uses the Koku measure extensively as a plot device by many of the main characters as a method of reward, punishment and enticement. While fiction, it shows the importance of the fief, the rice measure and payments.

<text>Sharadchandra Govindrao Pawar (Marathi pronunciation: , born 12 December 1940) is an Indian politician. He served as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra for four terms and in the Union Council of Ministers as the Minister of Defence in the Cabinet of P.V. Narasimha Rao as well as the Minister of Agriculture in the Cabinet of Manmohan Singh. He is the first and former president of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which he founded in 1999, after separating from the Indian National Congress. He leads his faction of the NCP in the Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Indian parliament. He is the chairperson of Maha Vikas Aghadi, a regional Maharashtra-based political alliance.

Pawar comes from Baramati in Maharashtra and is the patriarch of the Pawar political family. Other politicians from the family include his daughter Supriya Sule, his nephew Ajit Pawar, and his nephew&#x27;s son Rohit Rajendra Pawar, among other members of his extended family. 

Outside of politics, Pawar has served as the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from 2005 to 2008 and as the president of the International Cricket Council (ICC) from 2010 to 2012. He was the president of the Mumbai Cricket Association from October 2013 to January 2017.

In 2017, the Indian government conferred upon him the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian honour of India.

==Personal life and family==
Pawar is one of eleven children born to Govindrao Pawar and Shardabai Pawar. Govindrao&#x27;s ancestors had moved to Baramati from the nearby Satara. Govindrao had a prolonged career in &quot;Sahakari Kharedi Vikri Sangh&quot;, a Baramati Farmers&#x27; Cooperative. He also managed &quot;Shahu boarding&quot;, a students&#x27; hostel, in the 1940s. In the 1950s, he was instrumental in setting up cooperative sugar mills in the region. 

Pawar was elected to the district local board three times between 1937 and 1952. He also looked after the family farm in Katewadi, ten kilometres from Baramati. He studied until 10th SSC (Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Board) from Maharashtra Education Society&#x27;s High School Baramati.

Pawar is married to Pratibha (née Shinde), daughter of the test cricketer Sadashiv Shinde. They have a daughter, Supriya Sule, who represents the Baramati constituency in the 17th Lok Sabha.

He is the oldest and senior member of the Pawar political dynastic family of Maharashtra. The family has two Members of Parliament and two Members of Legislative Assembly in the state assembly. Among them, Ajit Pawar was the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra.

Vasantrao, Pawar’s eldest brother and a lawyer, was murdered in a land dispute, allegedly by a hired assassin. Pratap Pawar, Pawar&#x27;s younger brother, runs the Marathi daily newspaper &quot;Sakal&quot;. One of Pawar&#x27;s nephews, Ajit Pawar, is a politician and currently serves as one of the two Deputy Chief Ministers of Maharashtra. His grandnephew Rohit Rajendra Pawar represents the Karjat constituency in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha.

==Political career==
===Early career===
Pawar&#x27;s first political activity was when he organized a protest march for Goan Independence in &quot;Pravaranagar&quot; in 1956. Although his older lawyer brother belonged to Peasants and Workers Party, the young Pawar preferred the Congress party and joined Youth Congress in 1958. He later became the president of &quot;Poona&quot; district (now Pune district) Youth Congress in 1962, and by 1964 had become one of two secretaries of the Maharashtra Youth Congress.

===1967–1978===
Early in his career, Pawar was regarded as a protégé of Yashwantrao Chavan, a politician from Maharashtra at that time. At the young age of 27 in 1967, Pawar was nominated as the candidate for the Baramati of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly over more established members by the undivided Congress Party. He won the election and represented the constituency from 1967 to 1990. In 1969, when the Congress Party split after the 1969 Indian presidential election, he opted for the Congress(R) faction of prime minister Indira Gandhi, along with his mentor Yashwantrao Chavan. 

As the MLA of Baramati in the early 1970s, he was instrumental in building percolation tanks during a severe drought in Maharashtra. Like most Congress party politicians from rural western Maharashtra, he was also heavily involved in the politics of the local cooperative sugar mills and other member-run cooperatives societies. 

In the early 1970s, the Chief Minister at the time Vasantrao Naik had been in power for almost a decade, and there was jockeying for succession among different factions of the state Congress party. Prominent leaders such as Shankarrao Chavan, who was a key figure in Maharashtra politics, and other emerging leaders were among those positioning themselves for influence and potential leadership roles. At that time, looking to the future leadership of the party, Yashwantrao Chavan persuaded Naik to bring Pawar into his cabinet as state home affairs minister in March 1972. 

===1978-1987===

In the 1977 Lok Sabha elections, The Congress Party, under Indira Gandhi, lost power to the Janata Alliance. Taking responsibility for the loss of a large number of seats in Maharashtra, chief minister Shankarrao Chavan resigned shortly afterward and was replaced by Vasantdada Patil. Later in the year, the Congress Party split again, with Pawar&#x27;s mentor Yashwantrao Chavan joining one faction, Congress (U), and Indira Gandhi leading her own faction, Congress (I). Pawar himself joined the Congress (U) faction. In the state assembly elections held early in 1978, the two Congress parties ran separately, but then formed an alliance to keep power for Vasantdada Patil. This was in response to the rise and success of the Janata Party, which emerged as the minority government after the election. Pawar served as Minister of Industry and Labour under the Patil government.

In July 1978, Pawar broke away from the Congress (U) party to form a coalition government with the Janata Party. In the process, at the age of 38, he became the youngest Chief Minister of Maharashtra. This Progressive Democratic Front (PDF) government was dismissed in February 1980, following Indira Gandhi&#x27;s return to power.

In the 1980 elections, Congress (I) won the majority in the state assembly, and A.R. Antulay took over as chief minister. Pawar took over the Presidency of his own Congress (S) party in 1983. For the first time, he won the Lok Sabha election from the Baramati parliamentary constituency in 1984. He also won the state assembly election of March 1985 from Baramati and preferred to return to state politics, and resigned his Lok Sabha seat. Congress (S) won 54 seats out of 288 in the state assembly, and Pawar became the leader of the opposition of the Progressive Democratic Front coalition, which included the BJP, PWP, and the Janata party.

===1987–1990===
His return to Congress (I) in 1987 has been cited as a reason for the rise of the Shiv Sena at that time. Pawar had stated at the time &quot;the need to save the Congress Culture in Maharashtra&quot; as his reason for returning to Congress. In June 1988, Prime Minister of India and Congress President Rajiv Gandhi decided to induct then Maharashtra Chief Minister Shankarrao Chavan into his Union Cabinet as Finance Minister; Pawar was chosen to replace Chavan as the chief minister. Pawar had the task of checking the rise of the Shiv Sena in state politics, which was a potential challenge to the dominance of Congress in the state. In the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, Congress won 28 seats out of 48 in Maharashtra. In the state assembly elections of February 1990, the alliance between the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party posed a stiff challenge to Congress. Congress fell short of an absolute majority in the state assembly, winning 141 seats out of 288. Pawar was sworn in as chief minister again on 4 March 1990, with the support of 12 independent or unaffiliated members of the legislative assembly (MLAs).

===Early 1990s===
During the course of the 1991 election campaign, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. The party elected P.V. Narasimha Rao as the party president. It was expected that the party president would become the prime minister in the event of a Congress victory. However, Pawar at that time had talked about the distinction between party president and prime minister. Since the Congress contingent from Maharashtra was the largest, Pawar felt he had a legitimate claim for the post of prime minister. However, Pawar eventually decided not to enter the contest. The Congress Parliamentary Party (party MPs) unanimously elected P.V. Narasimha Rao as their leader, and he was sworn in as prime minister on 21 June 1991. Rao named Pawar as defence minister. On 26 June 1991, Pawar took over that portfolio, and held it until March 1993. After Pawar&#x27;s successor in Maharashtra, Sudhakarrao Naik, stepped down after the disastrous handling of the Bombay riots, Rao asked Pawar to serve again as chief minister of the state. Pawar was sworn in as chief minister for his fourth term on 6 March 1993. Almost immediately, Mumbai experienced a series of bomb blasts, on 12 March 1993. Pawar&#x27;s response to the blasts attracted controversy. More than a decade later, Pawar admitted that he had &quot;deliberately misled&quot; people following the bombings, by saying that there were &quot;13 and not 12&quot; explosions, and had added the name of a Muslim-dominated locality to show that people from both communities had been affected. He attempted to justify this deception by claiming that it was a move to prevent communal riots, by falsely portraying that both Hindu and Muslim communities in the city had been affected adversely. He also admitted to lying about evidence recovered and misleading people into believing that it pointed to the Tamil Tigers as possible suspects.

===Mid-to-late 1990s===
In 1993, the Deputy Commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, G. R. Khairnar, made a series of accusations against Pawar for being involved in corruption and protecting criminals. Though Khairnar could not produce any evidence in support of his claims, it inevitably affected Pawar&#x27;s popularity. Notable social worker Anna Hazare started a fast-unto-death to demand the expulsion of 12 officers of the Maharashtra state forest department who had been accused of corruption. The opposition parties accused Pawar&#x27;s government of trying to shield the corrupt officers.

The 1994 Gowari stampede occurred at Nagpur, during the winter session of the state assembly, and killed 114 people. Nagpur Police were trying to disperse almost 50,000 Gowari and Vanjari protesters using baton charges but the police created panic and triggered a stampede amongst protesters. Allegations were made that the mishap occurred because welfare minister Madhukarrao Pichad did not meet with the delegation of the Vanjari people in time. Though Pichad, accepting moral responsibility for the mishap, stepped down, this incident was another setback to Pawar&#x27;s government.

After 16 years of protest by the Namantar Andolan (Name-change Movement), the state government finally renamed Marathwada University as Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University on 14 January 1994, the compromise new name being an expansion of the old name (&quot;Namvistar&quot;) rather than a complete change of name (&quot;Namanatar&quot;). As chief minister, Pawar announced few developments in university departments.

New elections to the Vidhan Sabha were held in 1995. The Shiv Sena-BJP coalition was leading Congress in the polls, and there was widespread rebellion in the Congress party. Shiv Sena-BJP won 138 seats while Congress retained only 80 seats in the state assembly. Pawar had to step down and Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi took over as chief minister on 14 March 1995. Until the Lok Sabha elections of 1996, Pawar served as the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly. In the 1996 General elections, Pawar won the Baramati seat in the Lok Sabha and left the state assembly.

In June 1997, Pawar unsuccessfully challenged Sitaram Kesri for the post of President of the Indian National Congress. In the mid-term parliamentary elections of 1998, Pawar not only won his constituency, Baramati, but also led Congress to a win by a large majority of Maharashtra Lok Sabha constituencies. Congress was aligned with the Republican Party of India (Athvale) and Samajwadi Party for the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra. The Congress party won 33 Lok Sabha seats outright, and the allied Republican Party of India won 4 more, for a total of 37 out of 48 in the state. Pawar served as Leader of Opposition in the 12th Lok Sabha.

===Formation of Nationalist Congress Party===
In 1999, after the 12th Lok Sabha was dissolved and elections to the 13th Lok Sabha were called, Pawar, P. A. Sangma, and Tariq Anwar demanded that the party needed to propose someone native-born as the prime ministerial candidate, instead of the Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, who had entered party politics and replaced Kesri as Congress president. This led to the trio&#x27;s expulsion from the party by the Congress working committee (CWC). In response, Pawar and Sangma founded the Nationalist Congress Party in June 1999. Despite the falling out, the new party aligned with the Congress party to form a coalition government in Maharashtra after the 1999 state assembly elections to prevent the Shiv Sena-BJP combine from returning to power. Pawar, however, did not return to state politics and Vilasrao Deshmukh of Congress was chosen as chief minister, with Chagan Bhujbal representing the NCP as deputy chief minister.

===Minister of agriculture in UPA government===
After the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Pawar joined the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as the Minister of Agriculture. He retained his portfolio when the UPA coalition government was reelected in 2009. He faced several crises and controversies during his tenure as Agriculture minister. Critics also point out that during his tenure as the minister agriculture, he spent time on cricket in his role as the president of BCCI than on his ministerial duties.

==== Wheat imports ====
In 2007, the BJP asked for Pawar&#x27;s resignation after alleging he was involved in a multi-crore Indian rupee (INR) scam involving wheat imports. In May 2007, a tender floated by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for procurement of wheat was cancelled when the lowest bid received was for US$263/ton. The government subsequently allowed private traders to purchase wheat directly from farmers that year resulting in a paucity of wheat to stock FCI granaries. By July 2007 the shortage at FCI was large enough to require import of wheat at a much higher price of 320–360 USD/ton. Taking advantage of this, traders who had domestically purchased wheat at 900 INR/ton earlier, were now offering the same to FCI at 1,300 INR/ton.

====Agricultural produce prices====
As the Minister of Agriculture, Pawar was consistently accused of colluding in the extreme hike in prices of agricultural produce:
* Wheat import in 2007 – The Bombay High Court issued notices to Union agriculture minister Pawar, questioning the decision to import defective red wheat, and asking for a directive to submit details of procurement of the crop from different states and the exact process of importing it.
* Sugar prices in 2009 – Opposition parties, including the BJP and the CPI(M) accused Pawar of engineering a steep rise in the price of sugar to the advantage of hoarders and importers.
* Wheat, Sugar, Rice, and Bean prices in 2009–2010 – The opposition accused Pawar to be responsible on the issue of spiraling prices.

====Farmer suicides====
Since the 1990s there had been a high number of farmer suicides in India: in excess of 10,000 per year, and totalling over 200,000 between 1997 and 2010. Pawar, as the agricultural minister, in 2006 had underplayed the rate of farmer suicide in India. However, he claimed at that time that his department was taking the necessary steps to reduce the numbers. His ministry initiated a series of government inquiries to look into the causes of farmers&#x27; suicides in 2012. In 2013 Pawar admitted that the suicides was a serious issue with many factors being responsible, and he said the government was increasing investment in agriculture and raising minimum prices of crops to increase farmers&#x27; income.

====Promotion of endosulfan====
Even though the pesticide endosulfan has been banned, India is slow to phase it out. In spite of its known negative health effects, Pawar made a remark that endosulfan is not yet proved dangerous. This remark prompted activist Dr. Vandana Shiva to call him a corrupt minister.

==== Other issues ====
In 2012, Pawar gave up the chairmanship of the Empowered Group of Ministers investigating the 2G spectrum case, days after his appointment by the prime minister, fearing that his association with the decision-making process would drag him into the 2G Spectrum controversy. In 2011, he also decided to resign from the committee that was reviewing the draft of the anti-corruption Lokpal bill after his inclusion in the committee was criticized by the anti-corruption campaigner, Anna Hazare.

===Career since 2014===
In January 2012, Pawar announced that he will not contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, in order to make way for young leadership. Pawar is at present a member of the Rajya Sabha. He was elected to the body in April 2014 for a six-year term. He lost his ministerial position when the BJP-led NDA defeated the ruling UPA government, in which Pawar was the minister of agriculture, in the general elections of 2014. Pawar&#x27;s NCP also lost power in Maharashtra after the 2014 assembly elections. The BJP had won a plurality of seats in the new assembly and initially formed a minority government with the NCP. The BJP&#x27;s estranged ally, the Shiv Sena later joined the BJP-led government, and that government then did not need the support of the NCP. In May 2017, Pawar ruled out being a candidate for the June 2017 Indian presidential election.

In the 2019 elections to the Lok Sabha, Pawar&#x27;s NCP and the Congress party had a seat-sharing arrangement. Similarly, despite their differences, the BJP and Shiv Sena once again contested the elections together under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) banner. The election gave a landslide victory to Narendra Modi&#x27;s BJP. Out of the 48 seats in Maharashtra, the Congress party won only one seat in the state, whereas the NCP won five seats from its stronghold of western Maharashtra.

The 2019 Lok Sabha elections were soon followed by elections to the Vidhan Sabhaa in October 2019. Predictions for the state&#x27;s ruling BJP–Shiv Sena alliance to win by a large margin led to a steady stream of defections from the NCP to the ruling alliance. Pawar was the star campaigner for the NCP-Congress alliance in the state.His campaigning during the assembly election was credited with helping not only the NCP but also the leaderless Congress party. Against predictions, the actual voting left the ruling alliance with fewer seats than in 2014. After the election, Pawar thought that his party would remain in opposition in the new assembly. However, differences between the Shiv Sena and the BJP led to a month of political drama, with Pawar and his family playing a pivotal roles. The drama ended with the NCP coming back into power on 28 November 2019, as part of a coalition between Shiv Sena, Congress, and the NCP, led by the Shiv Sena chief, Uddhav Thackeray, as the new chief minister of Maharashtra.

In June 2020, Pawar was re-elected to the Rajya Sabha.

Sharad Pawar, the founder and chief of NCP since 1999, announced his decision to step down from his post and also his unwillingness to contest election in future,at the launch of the second edition of his political memoirs &#x27; Lok Maze Sangati&#x27; (&#x27;People Accompany Me&#x27;). Sharad Pawar has had a long period of public life from 1 May 1958 to 1 May 2023.

Sharad Pawar took back his decision to step down as national leader of National Congress Party, citing &quot;strong sentiments&quot; his resignation had evoked among the party workers as well as leaders across the country. The octogenarian leader clarified that he would focus on assigning new responsibilities, through organizational changes and creating new leadership.

===2023 Ajit Pawar&#x27;s rebellion===
In July 2023, Ajit Pawar rebelled against Sharad Pawar and joined ruling BJP-Shiv Sena government and took oath as Deputy Chief minister of Maharashtra. The majority of NCP&#x27;s sitting MLAs deserted the party in support of Ajit Pawar. He claimed to the election commission that he was the president of the NCP. Later, in his followers&#x27; first public meeting, he claimed ownership over the party, including both its name and election symbol. This rebellion resulted in a schism in the party, between those who stayed loyal to Sharad Pawar and those who supported Ajit Pawar, similar to the 2022 Shiv Sena political crisis.

=== Member of coordination committee of Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance ===
Pawar has been appointed a member of the Coordination Committee of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance at its Mumbai convention on 1 September 2023. The coordination committee will decide the national agenda, common campaign issues and common program of the country&#x27;s main opposition alliance (I.N.D.I.A.).

==Sports administration==
Pawar has interests in cricket, kabbadi, kho kho, wrestling and football.
He has served as the head of various sports organisations, including:
* Mumbai Cricket Association
* Maharashtra Wrestling Association
* Maharashtra Kabbadi Association
* Maharashtra Kho Kho Association
* Maharashtra Olympics Association
* Board of Control for Cricket in India President 2005–2008
* International Cricket Council Vice President
* International Cricket Council President

==Educational institutions==
Early in his public career in 1972, Pawar founded Vidya Pratishthan to serve the educational needs of the rural poor. The organisation now runs a number of schools at all levels, and colleges specialising in subjects such as information technology, and Biotechnology in Baramati and other locations. Pawar is associated with the &quot;Hon. Sharad Pawar Public School,&quot; under the &quot;Shree Gurudatta Education Society&quot;; Sharad Pawar International School, Pune and the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy, near Mumbai. Pawar is the current president of the century-old educational organisation Rayat Shikshan Sanstha.

==Controversies==
===Criminal links===
In 1992–93, then-Maharashtra Chief Minister Sudhakarrao Naik made a statement that the state leader of Indian National Congress party and erstwhile-Chief Minister Pawar, had asked him to &quot;go easy on Pappu Kalani&quot;, a well known criminal-turned-politician. Shiv Sena chief, Bal Thackeray, later concurred with these allegations. Further, Chief Minister Naik also alleged that it was possible that Kalani and Hitendra Thakur, another criminal-turned-politician from Virar, had been given tickets to contest election for the Maharashtra State Legislature at the behest of Pawar, who also put in a word for Naik with the police when the latter was arrested for his role in post-Demolition of the Babri Masjid riots in Mumbai.

Pawar is also alleged to have close links with the underworld don Dawood Ibrahim through Ibrahim&#x27;s henchman Lakhan Singh based in the Middle East and a close relationship with Shahid Balwa, who is also a suspect in the 2G spectrum case. These allegations were strengthened by the revelation about the involvement of Vinod Goenka, Balwa&#x27;s business partner, in a controversial commercial project in Yerwada, Pune, which was being constructed under the same survey number as Pawar&#x27;s family friend, Atul Chordia, had constructed the Panchshil Tech Park. BJP leader Eknath Khadse alleged that it was Balwa who had applied for environmental clearance for the two projects, a charge that Chordia refuted. Coincidentally, Chordia&#x27;s Panchshil Pvt. Ltd. has Pawar&#x27;s daughter, Supriya Sule, and her husband Sadanand as investors. 

The state government&#x27;s decision to hand over a 3-acre plot of the Yerwada police station for &quot;re-development&quot; to Balwa was retracted following Balwa&#x27;s arrest. For several years, confusion existed about the number of blasts in the 1993 Bombay Bombings, whether they were 12 or 13 in number. This was because Pawar, the then chief minister of Maharashtra, stated on television that day that there had been 13 blasts, and included a Muslim-dominated locality in the list. He later revealed that he had lied on purpose, and that there had been only 12 blasts, none of them in Muslim-dominated areas; he also confessed that he had attempted to mislead the public into believing that the blasts could be the work of the LTTE, a Sri Lankan militant organization, when in fact intelligence reports had already confirmed to him that Mumbai&#x27;s Muslim underworld (known as the &quot;D-Company,&quot; a reference to Dawood Ibrahim) were the perpetrators of the serial blasts.

===Land allotment===
On 27 October 2007, the Bombay High Court served notices to institutions headed by Pawar, Ajit Pawar, and Sadanand Sule (Pawar&#x27;s son-in-law), along with a corresponding notice served to the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) on why special privileges were given to Pawar and his family. This was done in consideration of Public Interest Litigation No. 148 of 2006, filed by Shamsunder Potare alleging that the said 2002 land allocations in Pune were illegal. The institutions and properties mentioned include:
* Two plots given allotted to Vidya Pratishthan, an educational society headed by Sharad Pawar
* A plot allotted to Anant Smriti Pratishthan, headed by Ajit Pawar, the Maharashtra state minister for irrigation and Pawar&#x27;s nephew
* A plot allotted to Lavasa Corporation, owned by Sule. Sule handed over his share in 2006.
* A plot allotted to Shivajinagar Agriculture College
* A plot allotted to Sharadchandraji Scout and Guide Training Institute.

These allocations were allegedly made by NCP leader and minister Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar who was in charge of MKVDC at the time. Pawar was served a contempt of court notice on 1 May 2008 in connection with this case for issuing statements to the press even though the matter was &quot;subjudice&quot; at the time. Also in connection with the case, the respondents were directed not to create third-party interests in the property under dispute and to undertake any developments at their own risk.

===IPL exemption from tax controversy===
In 2010, in the case of tax exemptions of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Shiv Sena MLA Subhash Desai alleged that the state cabinet decided in January to impose the tax, before the year&#x27;s IPL season started, but the decision was not implemented because of NCP chief Pawar&#x27;s association with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Bombay High Court in August 2010 said there was &quot;nothing on record&quot; to show that the Union Minister influenced the Maharashtra government&#x27;s decision to exempt Indian Premier League matches from entertainment tax.

===Asset declaration===
In 2011, Pawar declared his assets to be worth as part of a mandatory disclosure, but his critics claimed that his wealth far exceeded the stated amount. In 2010, it was alleged that the Pawar family indirectly held a 16% stake in the City Corporation, which had bid for the Pune franchise of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Pawar and his family denied the allegations, but the bidders board of the IPL contradicted their claims.

===Nira Radia&#x27;s allegations===
In 2011, under investigation of the 2G spectrum case Nira Radia told the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that Agriculture Minister Pawar may be controlling the controversial DB Realty. According to the reports, she also told the investigative agency that Pawar may have spoken with former telecom minister A. Raja about the allocation of spectrum and licence to Swan Telecom. Radia also said that she had no documentary proof to back up her allegations. Pawar has denied any link with former DB managing director Shahid Balwa, who is now in CBI custody.

===Lavasa===
Pawar is alleged to have demanded compensation for allowing the planned-city Lavasa to be constructed. When Lavasa Corporation was receiving necessary clearances from the government of Maharashtra, relatives of Pawar had part-ownership of the company developing the project. Pawar&#x27;s daughter and son-in-law had more than 20% ownership between 2002 and 2004, and they later sold their stakes. A nephew of his was chairman of Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) when the MKVDC signed off on lease agreements for Lavasa and allowed it to store water and build dams.

===Comments on the 2010 Pune bombing===
After the 2010 Pune bombing of German Bakery, Pawar appeared to take the incident lightly. He said to the reporters, &quot;It is not alright to arrive at a conclusion that the entire Pune city has been targeted. The place where the blast took place is an isolated area&quot;, adding &quot;when I was Chief Minister, Mumbai saw 11 simultaneous blasts but everything returned to normal soon.&quot;

===Slapping incident===
Pawar was slapped by a youth named Harvinder Singh at the New Delhi Municipal Corporation Centre while leaving the premises after attending a literary function on 24 November 2011. The attacker, who previously is said to have also assaulted former telecom minister Sukh Ram, was later arrested in 2019.

===Turban controversy===
In 2018, Pawar asked party members to felicitate him with the pagadi (turban) of social reformer Mahatma Phule, instead of the usual Puneri Pagadi worn by peshwas (prime ministers) of the Maratha Empire. In response to criticism that he was trying to stir up anti-Brahmin sentiment and appeal to Dalits, Pawar said that he wasn&#x27;t rejecting any section of society but honoring his idols Phule, Babasaheb Ambedkar, and Shahu Maharaj.

===Details of Criminal Cases===
== Awards and honours ==

* Padma Vibhushan (2017) – In 2017, Pawar was honored with the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second highest civilian award, on the recommendation of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government. The timing of the award was questioned by observers and some attributed it to political motivations of the BJP.
* Newsmakers Achievers Awards 2022 
* Honoured Lokmat Parliamentary lifetime achievement award in the hands of Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu for parliamentarians who bring about progress, create hope and are a source of inspiration and pride for country.

==Health==
In 1999, Pawar was diagnosed with oral cancer and had oral surgery in April 2004. In March 2021, he underwent surgery for his gallbladder problem.

<text>&quot;The Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot; is the final tale of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s fourteenth-century poetic cycle &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Its teller, the Parson, is a virtuous priest who takes his role as spiritual caretaker of his parish seriously. Instead of telling a story as the other pilgrims do, he delivers a treatise on penitence and the Seven Deadly Sins. This was a popular genre in the Middle Ages; Chaucer&#x27;s is a translation and reworking that ultimately derives from the Latin manuals of two Dominican friars, Raymund of Pennaforte and William Perault. Modern readers and critics have found it pedantic and boring, especially in comparison to the rest of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. Some scholars have questioned whether Chaucer ever intended the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot; to be part of the &quot;Tales&quot; at all, but more recent scholarship understands it as integral to the work, providing an appropriate ending to a series of stories concerned with the value of fiction itself.

== Framing narrative ==

The General Prologue of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; introduces the characters, a diverse group of pilgrims on the way to Canterbury Cathedral to see the shrine of Thomas Becket. While the Host, Harry Bailey, proposes a story-telling competition in which each teller will tell two tales on the way there and two on the way back to the Tabard Inn in Southwark – a total of over 100 stories – only 24 full or partial tales exist. It is unclear whether Chaucer intended to write all 120, or whether he had never intended to fulfil the promise of the General Prologue in the first place. Additionally, when Chaucer died in the intended order of the tales in the collection was still unclear. However, it is evident from the Parson&#x27;s Prologue that – at least by the time Chaucer was writing the Prologue – it was intended to be the final tale: the competition&#x27;s host, Harry Bailly, tells the Parson that he would be an ideal tale-teller to end the contest, and the Parson agrees to &quot;knytte up al this feeste, and make an ende&quot; (&quot;tie up all this festivity, and make an end&quot;).

Thematically, it is linked to the Manciple&#x27;s Tale, which directly precedes it in all major manuscripts. The Manciple&#x27;s Tale warns against careless speech; when the host asks the Parson to tell a fable, the Parson refuses, condemning the telling of fables and referring to the Epistle to Timothy. The last two tales thus &quot;represent a closing down of the work&quot;. By the time Chaucer was writing the Parson&#x27;s Prologue, instead of following the plan of the General Prologue, which would have ended in a secular feast at the Tabard Inn in Southwark, he had chosen to end the work with the pilgrims still &quot;en route&quot; to Canterbury: instead of being judged by Harry Bailly on their storytelling, they will be judged by God on their souls.

==The Tale==

Unlike every other tale of Canterbury, the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot; is not a tale at all, but rather a treatise on penitence and the Seven Deadly Sins. Citing Saint John Chrysotom, the parson divides penitence into three parts: contrition of the heart, confession of the mouth, and satisfaction (making amends). In the first part, he explains at length how a person comes to universal and total contrition. In the second, he explains the kinds of sins, and how one makes a true confession. In the third and final part, he explains how to make satisfaction for one&#x27;s sins, and reminds his listeners that &quot;the fruyt of penaunce ... is the endelees blisse of hevene&quot; (§ 111; &quot;the result of penance ... is the endless bliss of Heaven&quot;). The section on the Seven Deadly Sins makes up the bulk of the text. For each sin, the Parson provides a definition, an analysis of its nature, its subtypes, and its countering virtue.

This kind of treatise was popular in the later Middle Ages, since it was decided at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) that every Christian should make confession at least once a year. Initially, manuals, written in Latin, were primarily intended as reference works for confessors. By Chaucer&#x27;s day, they circulated in vernacular languages, for personal, non-clerical use, as a kind of &quot;self-help manual&quot;. Chaucer appears to have compiled the tale himself mostly from three different thirteenth-century works, translating their contents into English. He used the &quot;Summa de poenitentia&quot; of the Dominican Raymund of Pennaforte for the sections on contrition, confession, and satisfaction, inserting the material on the sins in the middle from a source that ultimately traces to the &quot;Summa vitiorum&quot; of Dominican William Perault. (Chaucer may have come to this text in a shortened form that was circulating in England at the time.) He also incorporated elements from the &quot;Summa virtutum de remediis anime&quot;, a work on the remedial virtues. Chaucer adapted and condensed these works, interspersing them with elements from proverbs and other literature. Some parts of the tale have no parallel in the sources. Since Chaucer typically follows his sources quite closely, it is possible that he had another source for the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which is either yet unknown or now lost to us. No external evidence has been found that would help scholars date the tale precisely.

It is possible that the tale was originally written outside of the context of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, and only added to them at a later date. Popular among early Chaucer scholars was the hypothesis that not only was this the case, but that Chaucer had never intended it to be part of the &quot;Tales&quot; at all. Instead, so this theory goes, Chaucer left the Parson&#x27;s Prologue without a tale to follow it, and what we know of as the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot; was added to this gap. Some scholars have even suggested that the tale was not composed by Chaucer at all, but simply copied or translated by him for his own use, and added to the &quot;Tales&quot; after his death. While this view is no longer common, even scholars who believe the work to be Chaucer&#x27;s find that it does not refer back to the rest of the &quot;Tales&quot; as one might expect, even though they include many examples of the sins that the Parson decries.

== Manuscript context ==

The &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot; is included in most manuscripts of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, but owing to its position as the final tale, damage to the manuscripts has often left it incomplete.

The scribes who copied the tale often added marginal glosses and other textual to help readers navigate the dense paragraphs of text.

== Character of the Parson ==
A parson is a type of priest who holds a curate - a type of ecclesiastical benefice in which the holder is responsible for the care of souls, in this case the people of the parson&#x27;s parish. Chaucer&#x27;s Parson fulfils his role well. The General Prologue describes the Parson as, foremost, &quot;a good man&quot;; the implication is that, unlike other religious characters in the &quot;Tales&quot;, his vocation is subordinate to his character. He is poor in wealth, but rich in holiness. He is generous, and, rather than abandoning his benefice and heading to London, he has stayed in the countryside with his parishioners. At least according to the Narrator of the &quot;Tales&quot;, he is innocent of the common abuses of ecclesiastical office. This is in stark contrast to other contemporary portrayals of priests, such as Langland&#x27;s Sloth.

The Host suggests that the Parson might be a Lollard, a follower of a reformist religious movement that is now seen as &quot;proto-Protestant&quot; and which has been linked to many social conflicts in 14th- and 15th-century England. Following the Host&#x27;s example, scholars have examined the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot; for hints of Lollardy, and suggested that Chaucer himself may have held Lollard sympathies. The Parson&#x27;s own vocabulary, however, is orthodox in nature. His discussion of sin is, while in depth, theologically conventional; he presents sin as a dis-ordering of the divine rules by which &quot;alle thynges been ordeyned and nombred&quot;.

Scholars are divided on how much the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot; represents Chaucer&#x27;s own beliefs, as opposed to imagined beliefs of the fictional character of the Parson. The Parson&#x27;s portrait in the General Prologue &quot;stresses his teaching by example rather than by precept&quot;; unlike other characters, who use scripture for their own ends, the Parson is the only one who uses scripture for the exclusive purpose of benefiting his listeners&#x27; souls. His tale, accordingly, is somewhat drab, boring, and single-voiced. Because sin is the subversion of reason, the Parson avoids appealing to his listeners&#x27; emotions. Nevertheless, scholars have found some elements of Chaucerian style and rhetoric in the piece. Some have even taken the prim nature of the tale as a twist of Chaucerian irony.

The General Prologue introduces the Plowman as the Parson&#x27;s brother; however, the Plowman never delivers a tale.

== Interpretation ==
In general, modern readers have struggled with this tale, seeing it as a repudiation of the rest of Chaucer&#x27;s work. The contrast between the previous more lively tales and the Parson&#x27;s treatise has disappointed many readers; E. Talbot Donaldson, for example, wrote that &quot;in literary terms it is ill-tempered, bad-mannered, pedantic, and joyless, and when it is used as a gloss to the other tales it distempers them, fills them with ill-humour, coats them with dust, and deprives them of joy.&quot; Reconciling this disjunction has been the focus of much of the scholarship on this tale. One such take holds that the &quot;Tales&quot; becomes increasingly concerned with speech and the value of fiction towards the end, culminating in the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale.&quot; Other scholars have pointed out that, rather than conflicting with the plan set out in the General Prologue, the &quot;Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot; completes it: &quot;after the sin comes its remedy.&quot; Taken on its own, however, although the tale is importantly located at the end of Chaucer&#x27;s compilation, &quot;its most important characteristic [is] its generality.&quot; Even Chaucer&#x27;s pilgrims, who have rarely agreed on anything at all, are united as an audience to the Parson&#x27;s &quot;woordes for us alle&quot;.

<text>Diane Wakoski (born August 3, 1937) is an American poet. Wakoski is primarily associated with the deep image poets, as well as the confessional and Beat poets of the 1960s. She received considerable attention in the 1980s for controversial comments linking New Formalism with Reaganism.

== Life and work ==
Wakoski was born in Whittier, California. She studied at the University of California, Berkeley where she graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. During her time at this university she participated in Thom Gunn&#x27;s poetry workshops. It was there that she first read many of the modernist poets who would influence her writing style. Her early writings were considered part of the deep image movement that also included the works of Jerome Rothenberg, Robert Kelly, and Clayton Eshleman, among others. She also cites William Carlos Williams, Allen Ginsberg and Charles Bukowski as influences. 
Her poetry career began in New York City, where she moved with La Monte Young in 1960. She remained a resident of New York City until 1973.
Her later work is more personal and conversational in the Williams mode. Wakoski is married to the photographer Robert Turney, and is University Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan.

Wakoski&#x27;s literary works have been recognized and highlighted at Michigan State University in their &quot;Michigan Writers&quot; Series.

Her work has been published in more than twenty collections and many slim volumes of poetry. Her selected poems, &quot;Emerald Ice&quot;, won the William Carlos Williams Prize from the Poetry Society of America in 1989. She is best known for a series of poems collectively known as &quot;The Motorcycle Betrayal Poems&quot;. Many of her books have been published in fine editions by Black Sparrow Press. In 2022, Black Sparrow Press published an expanded edition of &quot;The Motorcycle Betrayal Poems&quot; titled &quot;Dancing on the Grave of a Son of a Bitch: The Complete Motorcycle Betrayal Poems.&quot; The new hardcover edition includes an introduction by Elizabeth A.I. Powell, additional poems, and an afterword by Wakoski.

<doc id="404176" wikidata="Q2260441" url="?curid=404176" title="The Knight's Tale">
<text>&quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; () is the first tale from Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

The Knight is described by Chaucer in the &quot;General Prologue&quot; as the person of highest social standing amongst the pilgrims, though his manners and clothes are unpretentious. We are told that he has taken part in some fifteen crusades in many countries and also fought for one pagan leader against another. Though the list of campaigns is real, his characterization is idealized. Most readers have taken Chaucer&#x27;s description of him as &quot;a verray, parfit gentil knyght&quot; to be sincere but Terry Jones suggested that this description was ironic, and that Chaucer&#x27;s readers would have deduced that the Knight was a mercenary. He is accompanied on his pilgrimage by the Squire, his 20-year-old son.

The story introduces themes and arguments typically encountered in the literature of knighthood, including courtly love and ethical dilemmas.

==Sources and composition==
The epic poem &quot;Teseida&quot; (full title &quot;Teseida delle Nozze d’Emilia&quot;, or &quot;The Theseid, Concerning the Nuptials of Emily&quot;) by Giovanni Boccaccio is the source of the tale, although Chaucer makes many significant diversions from that poem. The &quot;Teseida&quot; has 9,896 lines in twelve books, while &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; has only 2,250 lines—though it is still one of the longest poems in the &quot;Tales&quot;. Most of the epic characteristics of the &quot;Teseida&quot; are removed, and instead the poem conforms primarily to the genre of romance; there are no epic invocations; the fighting and mythological references are severely reduced; and Theseus&#x27;s conquests, the assault on Thebes, and the epic catalogue of heroes fighting for Palamon and Arcite are all severely compressed. The Knight-narrator repeatedly admits that he must skip past such details so that other pilgrims will get a chance to tell their stories.

The tale is considered a chivalric romance, yet it is markedly different from either the English or French traditions of such tales. For instance, there is the inclusion of philosophical themes—mainly of the kind contained in the &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot; of Boethius—astrological references, and an epic context.

The tale is the first to be told in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, as it is announced as such in the &quot;Prologue.&quot; The tale that follows it is told by the drunken Miller and also involves a conflict between two men over a woman. It is a direct antithesis to the Knight&#x27;s in register, with none of the nobility or heritage of classical mythology, but is instead a rollicking, bawdy fabliau, and designed to annoy the Knight and amuse the other pilgrims with its crude comedy.

==Synopsis==

Two cousins and knights, Palamon and Arcite, are captured and imprisoned by Theseus, duke of Athens, after being found unconscious following his battle against Creon. Their cell sits in the tower of Theseus&#x27;s castle, with a window which overlooks his palace garden. The imprisoned Palamon wakes early one morning in May and catches sight of Emelye, who is Theseus&#x27;s sister-in-law, below in the courtyard picking flowers for a garland. He instantly falls in love with her, wondering if she is human or a goddess; his moan is heard by Arcite, who then also wakes and sees Emelye. He falls in love with her as well. This angers Palamon, who believes that he claimed her first. Arcite argues that he also loved Emelye before it was even established that she was human, and adds that love obeys no rules anyway.

The friendship between Palamon and Arcite quickly deteriorates over their competition for Emelye. After some years, Arcite is released from prison through the help and advice of Perotheus, a mutual friend of Theseus and Arcite, commuting Arcite&#x27;s sentence from imprisonment to exile; but Arcite laments that being away from Emelye is worse than imprisonment. He later secretly returns to Athens in disguise and enters service in Emelye&#x27;s household, to get close to her. Palamon eventually escapes by drugging the jailer, and, while hiding in a grove, overhears Arcite singing about love and fortune.

They begin to duel with each other over who should get Emelye, but are thwarted by the arrival of Theseus&#x27;s hunting party. Theseus plans to sentence the two to summary execution, but upon the protests of his wife and Emelye, he decides to have them compete in a tournament instead. Palamon and Arcite are to gather 100 men apiece and to fight a mass judicial tournament, the winner of which is to marry Emelye. The forces are assembled one year later and lavishly banqueted by Theseus. On the early morning before the tournament, Palamon prays to Venus to make Emelye his wife; Emelye prays to Diana to remain unmarried, or else to marry the one who truly loves her; and Arcite prays to Mars for victory. Theseus lays down rules for the tournament so that if any man becomes seriously injured, he must be dragged out of the battle and withdrawn from the combat. Because of this, the narrator (the Knight) claims that there were no deaths on either side.

Although both Palamon and Arcite fight valiantly, Palamon is wounded by a chance sword thrust from one of Arcite&#x27;s men, and is unhorsed. Theseus declares the fight over. Arcite has won the battle; but Saturn intervenes on Venus&#x27;s side, and Arcite&#x27;s horse throws him off and falls on him, leaving him mortally wounded, before he can claim Emelye as his prize. As he dies in bed, he tells Emelye that she should marry Palamon, because he would make a good husband for her. After a heroic burial and a period of mourning, Theseus proclaims that Palamon should marry Emelye, and thus all three prayers are fulfilled.

==The First Mover==
The First Mover or the Firste Moevere is a speech delivered by Theseus, spanning lines 2129–2216, bringing the poem&#x27;s narrative to its close.

===Background===
The First Mover speech appears near the end of the poem, after the protagonists Arcite and Palamon have finished their duel for Emelye&#x27;s hand; Arcite is fatally injured, and Theseus speaks to console Emelye and Palamon as they grieve for Arcite.

===Summary===
Theseus begins with a reference to the First Mover, the &quot;primum movens&quot;, or unmoved mover of Aristotelian philosophy creating the “Great Chain of Love”, the &quot;kyndely enclyning&quot;, or natural inclination, that holds the universe together in medieval cosmology. He describes the inevitability of death for all things at their proper time, using the destruction of an oak tree, a stone, and a river as examples, and listing all the classes of medieval society as universally subject to death. He then shifts to a discussion of the proper way to respond to this inevitability of death. Theseus maintains that, since every man must die when his time comes, that it is best to die with a good name and reputation, on good terms with his friends, and having died with honour. Theseus&#x27;s comfort to Emelye and Palamon is that Arcite died in just such a manner, having acquitted himself well in a feat of arms.

===Scholarly interpretation===
It is generally acknowledged among scholars that the First Mover speech draws on the philosophy of Boethius. What the purpose of the speech is, however, has been assessed variously. Some scholars maintain that the speech, with its Boethian elements, is not only representative of Boethian philosophy, but of Chaucer&#x27;s own beliefs, and a reconciliation of Boethian and Christian philosophy, though this is disputed.
The speech has also been read as a parody of Boethius&#x27;s &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;, as a narrative device simply conveying an idea from the character of Theseus to the characters of Palamon and Emelye, as a transition from a tragic character death to a happy ending, as a counsel of how and when to die properly, and even as an expression of disappointment in not only the events of the tournament, but in the divine order he describes.

==Adaptations and derivations==
Richard Edwardes&#x27;s 1566 play &quot;Palamon and Arcite&quot; is based on this tale, but the text of the play is lost. Another version of the story was performed in 1594, but this is only known from a reference in Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary. &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, a 1613 play co-written by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, is based on the tale.

John Dryden translated this story into the language of his time—modern English. Dryden&#x27;s book is titled &quot;Palamon and Arcite&quot; and is longer than the original text due to the insertion of embellishments by the later poet.

In Alan Plater&#x27;s 1975 TV series &quot;Trinity Tales&quot; the story is transformed into a competition between two young men for the attentions of a barmaid.

The story is one of the tales that inspired the 2001 movie &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, in which Chaucer himself is one of the principal characters, alongside Heath Ledger as William Thatcher, a peasant squire who poses as a knight and competes in tournaments, winning accolades and acquiring friendships with such historical figures as Edward the Black Prince (James Purefoy).

It was also adapted for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; in 2003. The names of the characters Palamon and Arcite are changed to Paul (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Ace (John Simm), and the story was moved to a modern prison setting where the two men battle for the attentions of a prison teacher named Emily (Keeley Hawes).

Director Luca Guadagnino and screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes&#x27;s film &quot;Challengers&quot; is based on this tale. The names of the characters Palamon and Arcite are changed to Patrick (Josh O&#x27;Connor) and Art (Mike Faist), and Emily becomes Tashi Duncan (Zendaya). The setting is the world of competitive tennis.

<text>Aldi (stylised as ALDI) (German pronunciation: ) is the common company brand name of two German multinational family-owned discount supermarket chains operating over 12,000 stores in 18 countries. The chain was founded by brothers Karl and Theo Albrecht in 1946, when they took over their mother&#x27;s store in Essen. The business was split into two separate groups in 1960 that later became Aldi Nord (initially Northern West Germany), headquartered in Essen, and Aldi Süd (initially Southern West Germany), headquartered in neighbouring Mülheim.

In 1962, they introduced the name Aldi (a syllabic abbreviation for &quot;Albrecht Diskont&quot;). In Germany, Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd have been financially and legally separate since 1966, although both divisions&#x27; names may appear as if they were a single enterprise with certain store brands or when negotiating with contractor companies. Each company is owned and operated independently, but they do have contractual business with one another.

Aldi&#x27;s German operations consist of Aldi Nord&#x27;s 35 individual regional companies with about 2,200 stores in western, northern, and eastern Germany, and Aldi Süd&#x27;s 32 regional companies with 2,000 stores in western and southern Germany. Internationally, Aldi Nord operates in Belgium, Netherlands, France, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal and Spain, while Aldi Süd operates in Australia, Austria, China, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Slovenia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In Austria and Slovenia, Aldi operates stores under the Hofer brand. Aldi Nord also owns the Trader Joe&#x27;s grocery chain in the United States, which operates separately from the group. 

Aldi is the chief competitor of the German discount chain Lidl in several markets.

==History==

In 1913, Karl and Theo Albrecht&#x27;s mother opened a small store in a suburb of Essen, Germany. Their father was employed as a miner, and after asthma forced him to quit said job, later found work as a baker&#x27;s assistant. Karl and Theo were born in 1920 and 1922, respectively. Theo Albrecht completed an apprenticeship in his mother&#x27;s store, while Karl Albrecht worked in a delicatessen.

Karl Albrecht took over a food shop formerly run by Judt, and later served in the German Army during World War II. In 1945, the brothers took over their mother&#x27;s business and soon opened another retail outlet nearby. By 1950, the Albrecht brothers owned 13 stores in the Ruhr Valley.

The brothers&#x27; idea was to subtract the legal maximum rebate of 3% before sale. The market leaders at the time, which often were co-operatives, required their customers to collect rebate stamps and to send them at regular intervals to reclaim their money. The Albrecht brothers also rigorously removed merchandise that did not sell from their shelves, cutting costs by neither advertising nor selling fresh produce and keeping the size of their retail outlets small. By 1960, 300 stores were in Germany.

=== Split ===
The brothers split the company in 1960, reportedly over a dispute about whether they should sell cigarettes. Karl believed they would attract shoplifters, while his brother, Theo, did not. This led to Theo running Aldi Nord, and Karl running Aldi Süd. At the time, they jointly owned 300 shops. Journalist Martin Kuhna, however, questioned said reason for the split in an article published by the &quot;Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; (WAZ) in September 2009, where he suspected that the real reason for the split lay in the vastly differing management styles of the brothers. In 1962, they introduced the name Aldi—short for , which translates into English as Albrecht Discount, which became their formal corporate name in 1975. Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd have been financially and legally separate since 1966.

The individual groups were originally owned and managed jointly by the brothers. After the death of Theo&#x27;s son Berthold, Aldi Nord continues to be controlled by the Albrecht family through its Markus, Lukas, and Jakobus Foundations, which hold a combined 80.5 per cent of the company&#x27;s issued capital.

=== International expansion ===
Aldi started to expand internationally in 1967, when Aldi Süd acquired the grocery chain Hofer in Austria. Aldi Nord opened its first stores abroad in the Netherlands in 1973, and other countries followed. In 1976, Aldi Süd opened its first store in the United States in Iowa, and, in 1979, Aldi Nord acquired Trader Joe&#x27;s. 

After German reunification and the fall of the Iron Curtain, Aldi experienced a rapid expansion. The brothers retired as CEOs in 1993. Control of the companies was placed in the hands of private family foundations, the Siepmann Foundation (Aldi Süd) and the Markus, Jakobus, and Lukas Foundation (Aldi Nord, Trader Joe&#x27;s).

==== Acquisition of Winn-Dixie and Harveys ====
In August 2023, Aldi Süd acquired Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarket in the US, including about 400 stores across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi. On March 7, 2024, Aldi Süd closed the Southeastern Grocers acquisition and announced it would open 800 new US stores by the end of 2028, with some being Winn-Dixie and Harveys stores converted to the Aldi format. On February 7, 2025, Aldi divested around 170 Winn-Dixie and Harvey Supermarket stores as well as 170 of its liquor stores back to Southeastern Grocers in a private investor deal that represents the leadership of SEG and includes C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers. Aldi also announced plans to convert 220 of the stores over to its own format by 2027 which will they will run under license from SEG until the final store is converted.

==Business organisation==
===Germany===

The Aldi Nord group currently consists of 35 independent regional branches with around 2,500 stores. Aldi Süd is made up of 24 companies with 2,000 stores. The border between their territories is commonly known as the () and runs from the Rhine via Mülheim an der Ruhr, Wermelskirchen, Marburg, Siegen, and Gießen east to just north of Fulda.

The former East Germany is served by Aldi Nord, except for one Aldi Süd in Sonneberg, Thuringia, whose regional office is in Bavaria. The regional branches are organised as limited partnerships, with a regional manager for each branch, who reports directly to the head office in Essen (Aldi Nord) or Mülheim an der Ruhr (Aldi Süd).

===Internationally===

The Aldi group operates over 12,000 stores worldwide. Aldi Nord is responsible for its stores in Northern Germany, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. Aldi Nord also owns the Trader Joe&#x27;s grocery chain in the United States, which operates separately from the group. Aldi Süd&#x27;s responsibilities are for Southern Germany, Australia, China, Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and through Austrian subsidiary Hofer AG in Austria, Hungary, Italy, Slovenia, and Switzerland. 

In Austria and Slovenia, Aldi Süd operates their stores under the Hofer brand. Aldi Süd&#x27;s first Swiss store opened in 2005, and it has operated in Hungary since 2007. Aldi Süd had invested an estimated €800m (US$1bn; £670m) in Greece from November 2008 until pulling out in December 2010.

While Aldi Nord has renamed its Dutch and Belgian subsidiaries &quot;Combi&quot; and &quot;Lansa&quot; to the &quot;Aldi Markt/Aldi Marché&quot; brand, Aldi Süd tries to maintain a regional appearance, branding its stores &quot;Aldi Süd&quot; in Germany, &quot;Aldi Suisse&quot; in Switzerland, and &quot;Hofer&quot; in Austria and Slovenia.

Aldi launched in Great Britain on 5 April 1990, when it opened its first store there in Stechford, Birmingham, using the wholly owned English-registered company of Aldi Stores Limited. In October 2013, Aldi opened its 300th store in Great Britain. By 2017, Aldi had over 600 stores there and was opening them at a rate of more than one a week. In January 2022, Aldi launched its Shop&amp;Go concept in Greenwich, London. In September 2022 Aldi overtook Morrisons to become Britain&#x27;s 4th largest supermarket, with a 9.3% market share. In September 2023, Aldi opened its 1,000th location in the UK and shared its plan to open another 500 as a long-term goal.

Aldi entered the Irish market in 1999. In November 2024, its 163rd store in Ireland opened in Tullamore (County Offaly).
Aldi opened its first Australian store in Sydney in 2001, and has grown rapidly since, maintaining a 12.6% market share as of early 2016. It has yet, , to open any stores in the state of Tasmania and in Northern Territory. Financial website Canstar rated Australia&#x27;s supermarkets based on the feedback of 2,897 consumers who had visited one in the past month with Aldi coming out on top. By August 2019, there were 540 Aldi stores in Australia. Aldi had approximately 11 percent share of the Australian grocery market in 2018.

Aldi Süd expanded to the United States under the Aldi banner, having expanded throughout the Eastern and Midwestern US. Aldi Süd revealed expansion plans in 2015, and expanded into the Southern California market, where Aldi Nord&#x27;s Trader Joe&#x27;s is based. Reports in August 2019 stated that the company was in the process of using a $3.4 billion investment to expand to 2,500 stores in the country by the end of 2022. It also invested an extra $1.6 billion to renovate 1,300 of its US stores. 

By October 2024, 2,428 Aldi Süd stores were in 39 US states. Groceries ordered online could be delivered to homes in the areas covered by 95% of stores in the US, provided in conjunction with Instacart. In March 2024, Aldi said that it is planning to invest over $9 billion and open 800 new stores in the United States by the end of 2028.

Aldi Süd opened its first 10 stores in Italy in March 2018. In the first year of operation, 51 outlets were opened. By October 2019, 66 stores were in northern Italy. At that time, the company was planning to open 80 new stores in the country, as well as a distribution centre in Landriano.

In mid-2019, Aldi Süd opened two small, upscale stores in Shanghai. Two more were opened in late 2019. This is the first of a planned 100 such locations in the city.

In December 2020, Aldi bought 545 supermarkets and three warehouses of Leader Price and another two Casino supermarkets in France for €717 million from Casino Group. The transaction is part of Aldi&#x27;s plan to catch up with Lidl in France.

In December 2022, Aldi Nord issued a press release stating that Aldi is withdrawing from Denmark after 45 years of operations there; 114 of the chain&#x27;s total of 188 stores will be taken over by Norwegian competitor Rema 1000. In August 2023, the Danish Competition and Consumer Authority approval of the Rema 1000 acquisition was announced.



===Geographic distribution===
==Business practices==
In August 2018, Aldi Nord announced plans to expand its product selection by offering more organic, fresh, and easy-to-prepare meals. Aldi also On 18 September 2018, Aldi announced its intent to offer grocery delivery in the United States. Aldi began testing grocery delivery in 2017 in select cities, such as Atlanta, Georgia and Chicago, Illinois.

===In-store layout===
Aldi stores are noted as examples of so-called no-frills stores that often display a variety of items at discount prices, specializing in staple items, such as food, beverages, toilet paper, sanitary articles, and other inexpensive household items. Many of its products are own brands, with the number of other brands usually limited to a maximum of two for a given item.

Aldi mainly sells exclusively produced, custom-branded products, often very similar to and produced by major brands, with brand names including Grandessa, Happy Farms, Millville, Simply Nature, Clancy&#x27;s, and Fit &amp; Active.

Branded products carried include Haribo in Germany, Knoppers in Belgium, France, and the United States, Marmite and Branston Pickle in Great Britain, and Vegemite and Milo in Australia. Unlike most shops, Aldi does not accept manufacturers&#x27; coupons, although some US stores successfully experimented with them.

In addition to its standard assortment, Aldi has weekly special offers, some of them on more expensive products such as electronics, tools, appliances, or computers. Discount items can include clothing, toys, flowers and gifts. Special offers have limits on quantities, and are for one week. Aldi&#x27;s early computer offers in Germany, such as a Commodore 64 in 1987, resulted in those products selling out in a few hours.

In many of its US locations, Aldi has &quot;Aldi Finds&quot; aisles placed in the center of their stores that feature random specialty items marked down in price, which has been nicknamed the &quot;aisle of shame&quot;.

Aldi is the largest wine retailer in Germany. Many Australian stores now sell alcoholic beverages. Some US stores also sell alcoholic beverages, mainly beer and wine, where permitted by local and state laws.

In March 2019, Aldi Süd launched smaller-format stores in the UK called Aldi Local, with the first store in Balham, south London. The store has slightly fewer products than a regular Aldi, a preference for fresh products, and two sizes of baskets rather than trolleys, and lacks the notable &quot;middle aisle&quot; of weekly offers.

In 2021, Aldi UK opened its first cashierless store in Greenwich.

===Advertising policy===
In the United States, it advertises in newspapers and on television, as well as print ads distributed in stores, and via the Internet.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, print and television ads have appeared since May 2005. In 2016, Aldi began producing a series of Christmas ads to rival John Lewis&#x27; featuring a carrot named Kevin. In 2024, Aldi partnered with British television channel Channel 4 to sponsor its food programming strands.

In Australia, television advertising is common, and the current ads are listed on the Australian website.

In Belgium, print, radio, and television ads started appearing in late 2017. These ads were based on the positive results of taste tests, where the chain pitted its own products against common name-brand products.

===Logos and branding===
The two stores Nord and Süd have distinct logos with Nord displaying the entire &#x27;A&#x27; for Aldi. Süd unveiled a logo in 1982 which displays half an &quot;A&quot;. In 2006, Aldi Süd modified the logo slightly and then in March 2017, unveiled a new logo that removed the blue box line around the artistic &#x27;A&#x27; and revealed a more rounded, three-dimensional look for the logo, as well as a new font for the word ALDI, further differentiating it from the Aldi Nord logo, which had shared the same font for the brand until then.

=== Sustainability ===
Between 2012 and 2019, Aldi&#x27;s UK operations became &quot;carbon neutral&quot;, with investments in solar, green energy, energy efficiency, and offsets reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 53% per square meter of sales floor. On 4 March 2020, Aldi announced that all its suppliers In January 2024, the company announced plans to eliminate plastic bags from its 2,300 US stores. Cloth bags would still be available for customer use. It also said it would aim to use natural refrigerants in its US stores by the end of 2035. Other grocery retailers were making similar moves at the time of the announcement.

==Reputation==
In the United Kingdom, Aldi has won Supermarket of the Year two years in a row (2012/13), and in 2013, Aldi won the Grocer of the Year Award. In February 2015, Aldi narrowly lost to Waitrose for the title of Supermarket of the Year 2015. In April 2015, Aldi overtook Waitrose to become the United Kingdom&#x27;s sixth-largest supermarket chain.

In February 2017, Aldi overtook the Co-op to become the United Kingdom&#x27;s fifth-largest supermarket chain. In May 2017, Aldi lost out to Marks &amp; Spencer for the title of Supermarket of the Year 2017, published by the magazine &quot;Which?&quot;. According to 2019 research, nearly two-thirds of households in the UK visit an Aldi or Lidl branch at least once every 12 weeks.

In the United States, due to the relatively low staffing of Aldi locations compared to other supermarket chains, Aldi has a reputation of starting employees out at significantly higher than minimum wage, unusual among American supermarkets.

In Ireland, Aldi has been accused of a &quot;lack of corporate responsibility&quot; to their farmer suppliers by the Irish Farmers&#x27; Association.

Aldi was named 2018 Retailer of the Year by &quot;Supermarket News&quot;.

Australian trucking giant Scott&#x27;s Refrigerated Logistics was plunged into receivership and liquidation in March 2023 after going into voluntary administration that February. This sparked protests from the Transport Workers&#x27; Union, who put the blame on Aldi Australia for increasing strains on the company during the last few years of shortages and inflation.

==Subsidiaries and joint ventures==
Subsidiaries include the mobile network operator Aldi Talk, the alcoholic drink brand Aldi Alcohol, and petrol station retailer Diskont. Home appliance and multimedia products are labeled under different names, mostly manufactured by Medion.

===Aldi Talk===
Aldi has a mobile virtual network operator in Germany called Aldi Talk, also known as MEDIONmobile (service provider is Medion). Aldi operates a similar network in Australia using Telstra&#x27;s network, called &quot;ALDImobile&quot;. Aldimobile is also in Switzerland by Sunrise LLC. In Austria and Slovenia, Hofer stores serve as distributors for the brand HoT Hofer Telekom (service provider is Ventocom).

===Aldi Alcohol===
Aldi sells low-cost alcohol from its alcohol stores. Until March 2016, Aldi had an alcohol website serving the east coast of Australia. This has now been closed down, citing it wishes to focus on expanding the supermarket chain across Australia. In November 2019, Aldi announced same-day beer and wine delivery via a partnership with Instacart in the US.

===Diskont===
In Austria through its subsidiary Hofer, Aldi has a joint venture with the local petrol retailer OMV Downstream GmbH, to create some no-frills petrol stations called Diskont. The 85 stations in Austria are on or near the stores, providing self-serve unleaded or diesel fuel by card-operated pumps. These have been in operation since 2009.

=== Aldi Insurance ===
Aldi launched Aldi Insurance in Australia in June 2024. The company provides home and contents insurance, car insurance, and landlord’s insurance backed by Honey Insurance and RACQ Insurance.

<doc id="404179" wikidata="Q2611119" url="?curid=404179" title="The Miller's Tale">
<text>&quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot; () is the second of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (1380s–1390s), told by the drunken miller Robin to &quot;quite&quot; (a Middle English term meaning requite or pay back, in both good and negative ways) &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;.
The Miller&#x27;s Prologue is the first &quot;quite&quot; that occurs in the tales.

==Prologue==
The general prologue to &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; describes the Miller, Robin, as a stout and evil churl fond of wrestling. In the Miller&#x27;s Prologue, the pilgrims have just heard and enjoyed &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a classical story of courtly love, and the Host asks the Monk to &quot;quite&quot; with a tale of his own. Before the Monk can respond, however, the drunken Miller insists on going next. The Host tries to persuade the Miller to let some &quot;bettre&quot; man tell the next tale, but acquiesces when the Miller threatens to leave the company. The Miller claims that his tale is &quot;noble&quot;, but reminds the other pilgrims that he is quite drunk and cannot be held accountable for what he says. He explains that his story is about a carpenter and his wife, and how a clerk &quot;hath set the wrightes cappe&quot; (that is, fooled the carpenter). Osewold the Reeve, who had originally been a carpenter himself, shouts out his immediate objection to such ridicule, and protests that the tale will insult carpenters and wives, but the Miller insists on proceeding with his tale.

&quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot; begins the trend in which succeeding tellers &quot;quite&quot; (or one-up) the previous story with their own. In a way, the Miller requites the &quot;Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; and is himself directly requited with &quot;The Reeve&#x27;s Tale&quot;, in which the Reeve follows Robin&#x27;s insulting story about a carpenter with his own tale disparaging a miller.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot; is the story of a carpenter, his lovely wife, and two younger men who are eager to sleep with her. The carpenter, John, lives in Oxford with his much younger wife, Alisoun, who is a local beauty. In order to make extra money, John rents out a room in his house to a clever Oxford University student named Nicholas, who has taken a liking to Alisoun. Another man in the town, Absolon, the parish clerk, also has his eye on Alisoun.

The action begins when John makes a day trip to a nearby town. While he is gone, Nicholas grabs Alisoun &quot;by the queynte&quot;. When she threatens to cry for help, he begins to cry and, after a few sweet words, she agrees to have sex with him when it is safe to do so. Their affair begins. Shortly afterward, Alisoun goes to church, where Absolon sees her and immediately is filled with &quot;love-longing.&quot; He tries to woo Alisoun by singing love songs under her window during the full moon and sending her gifts. He also seeks her attention by taking a part in a local play. However, Alisoun rebuffs all his efforts because she is already involved with Nicholas.

Nicholas, meanwhile, longs to spend a whole night in Alisoun&#x27;s arms rather than just the few moments they get during John&#x27;s absences. With Alisoun, he hatches a scheme that will enable him to do that. Being a student of astrology, Nicholas tells John that he has divined that a terrible event is about to occur. The next Monday night, there will be a massive flood, twice as great as the one in Noah&#x27;s time. God has told him they can save themselves by hanging three large tubs from the ceiling of the barn, each loaded with provisions and an axe. When the flood waters have risen, they can cut the ropes, hack through the roof, and float until the flood subsides. John believes him and, on Monday night, they ascend by ladders into the hanging tubs. As soon as John is asleep, Nicholas and Alisoun climb down, run back to the house, and sleep together in John&#x27;s bed.

That same night, Absolon comes to the house and begs Alisoun to kiss him. At first she refuses, but Absolon persists, so she offers him one quick kiss. Instead of presenting her lips to Absolon, though, she sticks her backside out the bedroom&#x27;s &quot;shot-window&quot; (privy vent), and Absolon kisses her &quot;ers&quot; (arse) in the dark. Angry at being fooled, Absolon gets a red-hot coulter from the blacksmith, with which he intends to burn Alisoun in revenge. He returns with it to the window and knocks again, promising Alisoun a gold ring in exchange for a kiss. This time, Nicholas, having gotten up anyway to relieve himself, sticks his buttocks out to get in on the joke and farts thunderously in Absolon&#x27;s face. Absolon thrusts the coulter &quot;amidst the ers&quot; of Nicholas who cries out for &quot;Water!&quot; to assuage the pain.

The screams wake John who, hearing the cries of &quot;water!&quot;, thinks &quot;Nowel&#x27;s flood&quot; (the unlettered carpenter confuses &quot;Noe&quot; (Noah) with &quot;Nowel&quot; (Christmas)) is upon them and cuts the rope attaching his tub to the ceiling. He crashes to the floor, breaking his arm, and the townspeople, hearing the noise, rush to the scene. Upon hearing Nicholas&#x27; and Alisoun&#x27;s version of events, they laugh at poor John and consider him mad. The tale ends: &quot;Thus, swyved was this carpenteris wyf, / For al his kepyng and his jalousye, / And Absolon hath kist hir nether ye, / And Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte!&quot;

==Arts and culture==
:Geoffrey Chaucer wrote during the reign of Richard II, who very much appreciated the arts and culture of the time. We see this in &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot; when Chaucer describes what is in Nicholas&#x27; bedroom.

His Almageste and books grete and smale,
His astrelabie longynge for his art,
Hise augrym stones layen faire apart
On shelves couched at his beddes heed&quot;
Nicholas is described not by his valor in battle or honour in the court. Instead, his many skills are described at great length, including the fact that he is studying one of the many scholarly arts that were popular at that time. Chaucer then goes on to describe what Nicholas is wearing and his skills as a musician.

His presse ycovered with a faldyng reed,
And al above ther lay a gay sautrie
On which he made a nyghtes melodie
So swetely that al the chambre rong,
And Angelus ad virginem he song,
And after that he song The Kynges Noote;
Full often blessed was his myrie throte!
Again Nicholas is shown not as a brave knight but as a talented musician. He is shown to be very cultured as well as studied. Chaucer shows that Nicholas was skilled in the art of music, as he knew these certain songs which might have been quite popular at the time. What Nicholas wears could also be here to show that Nicholas wore clothes befitting his social class status This focus on what a person could wear based on status was also important to Richard II.

==Analysis==
The tale appears to combine the motifs of two separate fabliaux, the &#x27;second flood&#x27; and &#x27;misdirected kiss&#x27;, both of which appear in continental European literature of the period. Its bawdiness serves not only to introduce the Reeve&#x27;s tale, but the general sequence of low comedy which terminates in the unfinished Cook&#x27;s tale.
This Absolom, that jolly was and gay,&lt;br&gt;
Gooth with a sencer (censer) on the haliday,&lt;br&gt;
Sensynge the wyves of the parisshe faste;&lt;br&gt;
And many a lovely look on hem he caste,&lt;br&gt;
And namely on this carpenteris wyf. (3339)
Alisoun, however, does not return Absolom&#x27;s affections, although she readily takes his gifts.

A third theme, that of knowledge and science, appears in several marginal comments. Nicholas is an avid astrologer (as Chaucer himself was), equipped with, &quot;His Almageste, and bookes grete and smale, / His astrelabie, longynge for his art...&quot; John the carpenter represents unintellectual laymen; John tells Nicholas:
Men sholde nat knowe of goddes pryvetee [God&#x27;s private affairs].&lt;br&gt;
Ye, blessed be alwey a lewed [unlearned] man&lt;br&gt;
That noght but oonly his bileve kan! [who knows nothing except the Creed] (3454)
He also recounts a story (sometimes told of Thales) of an astrologer who falls into a pit while studying the stars. The issue of whether learned or unlearned faith is better is also relevant to The Prioress&#x27;s Tale and The Parson&#x27;s Tale.

The Miller’s Tale draws on a lot of biblical information, mainly that of the Ark of the Covenant and Noah’s Ark. The Ark of the Covenant is referenced due to the root of the word arc meaning both chest and hidden in Latin, making an ark a hiding place. The ark of the Covenant was made to hide the tablets of law, Aaron’s Rod and the pot of manna, in a similar way, the tubs in which Nicholas, John and Alisoun are made to hide the 3 of them to keep them safe. The more obvious reference is to that of Noah’s Ark, Both Nicholas and Noah make reference to “Astrologye” being a catalyst for the information they receive about the coming flood. The stars were said to be able to predict events at the time. They also reference Divine Intervention of God speaking to them and the stars showing that a great cataclysm is coming. Nicholas uses this mix of astrology and information from God to convince John that he is not crazy by rooting it in how Noah found out. Chaucer also manages to draw a parallel between Gabriel the Angel and Nicholas by giving John the message about the flood, much like how Gabriel gave the message of Mary being pregnant with the son of God to her. Nicholas resembles Gabriel in the fact he is described somewhat effeminate and is eloquent with his words. The two diverge in the fact that Nicholas seduces John’s wife, and they commit adultery, which Gabriel did not do with Mary.

==Parody==
The tale is replete with puns. Much is made of variations on &quot;priv-&quot; implying both secret things and private parts. Nicholas fondles Alisoun&#x27;s &quot;queynte&quot;, a noun, while Absolom is described after his humiliation as having his ardour &quot;yqueynt&quot; or quenched.

The Miller&#x27;s name is intended as a pun on the phrase &quot;rob &#x27;em&quot;. As told in the Reeve&#x27;s Tale the Miller is a not just a bully but a thief of grain he is supposed to grind for his customers.

==Continuations==
The 15th-century Tale of Beryn depicts the Miller trying and failing to explain the stained glass windows of Canterbury cathedral.

Chaucer refers to the Distichs of Cato when discussing the age difference between Alison and her husband with this passage: &quot;He knew nat Catoun, for his wit was rude.&quot; The Distichs of Cato was one of the most common textbooks in schools throughout medieval Europe, and was familiar to almost anyone with a basic education in Latin.

The painting Netherlandish Proverbs by Pieter Breugel the Elder illustrates many of the themes in this story including a shot-window in use, a man with his backside on fire, a falling through a basket from a roof, pious hypocrisy, and cuckolding.

==Adaptations==
The Miller&#x27;s Tale is one of eight of Chaucer&#x27;s tales adapted in Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Jenny Runacre portrays Alison, Michael Balfour portrays John the carpenter, Dan Thomas portrays Nicholas, Peter Cain portrays Absolom, Martin Philips portrays Martin and Alan McConnell portrays Gervase the blacksmith.

<doc id="404181" wikidata="Q2100733" url="?curid=404181" title="Closed and exact differential forms">
<text>In mathematics, especially vector calculus and differential topology, a closed form is a differential form &quot;α&quot; whose exterior derivative is zero (), and an exact form is a differential form, &quot;α&quot;, that is the exterior derivative of another differential form &quot;β&quot;. Thus, an &quot;exact&quot; form is in the &quot;image&quot; of &quot;d&quot;, and a &quot;closed&quot; form is in the &quot;kernel&quot; of &quot;d&quot;.

For an exact form &quot;α&quot;, for some differential form &quot;β&quot; of degree one less than that of &quot;α&quot;. The form &quot;β&quot; is called a &quot;potential form&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot; for &quot;α&quot;. Since the exterior derivative of a closed form is zero, &quot;β&quot; is not unique, but can be modified by the addition of any closed form of degree one less than that of &quot;α&quot;.

Because , every exact form is necessarily closed. The question of whether &quot;every&quot; closed form is exact depends on the topology of the domain of interest. On a contractible domain, every closed form is exact by the Poincaré lemma. More general questions of this kind on an arbitrary differentiable manifold are the subject of de Rham cohomology, which allows one to obtain purely topological information using differential methods.

== Examples ==
A simple example of a form that is closed but not exact is the 1-form formula_1 given by the derivative of argument on the punctured plane Since formula_2 is not actually a function (see the next paragraph) formula_1 is not an exact form. Still, formula_1 has vanishing derivative and is therefore closed.

Note that the argument formula_2 is only defined up to an integer multiple of formula_6 since a single point formula_7 can be assigned different arguments etc. We can assign arguments in a locally consistent manner around but not in a globally consistent manner. This is because if we trace a loop from formula_7 counterclockwise around the origin and back to the argument increases by Generally, the argument formula_2 changes by
:formula_10
over a counter-clockwise oriented loop 

Even though the argument formula_2 is not technically a function, the different &quot;local&quot; definitions of formula_2 at a point formula_7 differ from one another by constants. Since the derivative at formula_7 only uses local data, and since functions that differ by a constant have the same derivative, the argument has a globally well-defined derivative 

The upshot is that formula_1 is a one-form on formula_16 that is not actually the derivative of any well-defined function We say that formula_1 is not &quot;exact&quot;. Explicitly, formula_1 is given as:
:formula_19
which by inspection has derivative zero. Because formula_1 has vanishing derivative, we say that it is &quot;closed&quot;.

On the other hand, for the one-form
:formula_21
formula_22.
Thus formula_23 is not even closed, never mind exact.

The form formula_1 generates the de Rham cohomology group formula_25 meaning that any closed form formula_26 is the sum of an exact form formula_27 and a multiple of where formula_28 accounts for a non-trivial contour integral around the origin, which is the only obstruction to a closed form on the punctured plane (locally the derivative of a potential function) being the derivative of a globally defined function.

== Examples in low dimensions ==

Differential forms in formula_29 and formula_30 were well known in the mathematical physics of the nineteenth century. In the plane, 0-forms are just functions, and 2-forms are functions times the basic area element formula_31, so that it is the 1-forms

:formula_32

that are of real interest. The formula for the exterior derivative formula_33 here is

:formula_34

where the subscripts denote partial derivatives. Therefore the condition for formula_23 to be &quot;closed&quot; is

:formula_36

In this case if formula_37 is a function then

:formula_38

The implication from &#x27;exact&#x27; to &#x27;closed&#x27; is then a consequence of the symmetry of second derivatives, with respect to formula_39 and formula_40.

The gradient theorem asserts that a 1-form is exact if and only if the line integral of the form depends only on the endpoints of the curve, or equivalently,
if the integral around any smooth closed curve is zero.

=== Vector field analogies ===
On a Riemannian manifold, or more generally a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, &quot;k&quot;-forms correspond to &quot;k&quot;-vector fields (by duality via the metric), so there is a notion of a vector field corresponding to a closed or exact form.

In 3 dimensions, an exact vector field (thought of as a 1-form) is called a conservative vector field, meaning that it is the derivative (gradient) of a 0-form (smooth scalar field), called the scalar potential. A closed vector field (thought of as a 1-form) is one whose derivative (curl) vanishes, and is called an irrotational vector field.

Thinking of a vector field as a 2-form instead, a closed vector field is one whose derivative (divergence) vanishes, and is called an incompressible flow (sometimes solenoidal vector field). The term incompressible is used because a non-zero divergence corresponds to the presence of sources and sinks in analogy with a fluid.

The concepts of conservative and incompressible vector fields generalize to &quot;n&quot; dimensions, because gradient and divergence generalize to &quot;n&quot; dimensions; curl is defined only in three dimensions, thus the concept of irrotational vector field does not generalize in this way.

== Poincaré lemma ==
The Poincaré lemma states that if &quot;B&quot; is an open ball in R&quot;n&quot;, any closed &quot;p&quot;-form &quot;ω&quot; defined on &quot;B&quot; is exact, for any integer &quot;p&quot; with .

More generally, the lemma states that on a contractible open subset of a manifold (e.g., formula_41), a closed &quot;p&quot;-form, &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0, is exact.

== Formulation as cohomology ==

When the difference of two closed forms is an exact form, they are said to be cohomologous to each other. That is, if &quot;ζ&quot; and &quot;η&quot; are closed forms, and one can find some &quot;β&quot; such that
:formula_42
then one says that &quot;ζ&quot; and &quot;η&quot; are cohomologous to each other. Exact forms are sometimes said to be cohomologous to zero. The set of all forms cohomologous to a given form (and thus to each other) is called a de Rham cohomology class; the general study of such classes is known as cohomology. It makes no real sense to ask whether a 0-form (smooth function) is exact, since &quot;d&quot; increases degree by 1; but the clues from topology suggest that only the zero function should be called &quot;exact&quot;. The cohomology classes are identified with locally constant functions.

Using contracting homotopies similar to the one used in the proof of the Poincaré lemma, it can be shown that de Rham cohomology is homotopy-invariant.

== Relevance to thermodynamics ==

Consider a thermodynamic system whose equilibrium states are specified by formula_43 thermodynamic variables, formula_44. The first law of thermodynamics can be stated as follows: In any process that results in an infinitesimal change of state where the internal energy of the system changes by an amount formula_45 and 
an amount of work formula_46 is done on the system, one must also supply an amount of heat

:formula_47

The second law of thermodynamics is an empirical law of nature which says that there is no thermodynamic system for which formula_48 in every circumstance, or in mathematical terms that, the differential form formula_49 is not closed. Caratheodory&#x27;s theorem further states that there exists an integrating denominator formula_50 such that

:formula_51

&quot;is&quot; a closed 1-form. The integrating denominator formula_50 is the temperature, and the state function formula_53 is the equilibrium entropy.
== Application in electrodynamics ==

In electrodynamics, the case of the magnetic field formula_54 produced by a stationary electrical current is important. There one deals with the vector potential formula_55 of this field. This case corresponds to , and the defining region is the full formula_30. The current-density vector is It corresponds to the current two-form

:formula_57

For the magnetic field formula_58 one has analogous results: it corresponds to the induction two-form and can be derived from the vector potential formula_59, or the corresponding one-form formula_60,

:formula_61

Thereby the vector potential formula_59 corresponds to the potential one-form

:formula_63

The closedness of the magnetic-induction two-form corresponds to the property of the magnetic field that it is source-free: i.e., that there are no magnetic monopoles.

In a special gauge, formula_64, this implies 
:formula_65

(Here formula_66 is the magnetic constant.)

This equation is remarkable, because it corresponds completely to a well-known formula for the &quot;electrical&quot; field formula_67, namely for the &quot;electrostatic Coulomb potential&quot; formula_68 of a &quot;charge density&quot; formula_69. At this place one can already guess that
* formula_67 and formula_71
* formula_72 and formula_73
* formula_74 and formula_59
can be &quot;unified&quot; to quantities with six rsp. four nontrivial components, which is the basis of the relativistic invariance of the Maxwell equations.

If the condition of stationarity is left, on the left-hand side of the above-mentioned equation one must add, in the equations for to the three space coordinates, as a fourth variable also the time &quot;t&quot;, whereas on the right-hand side, in the so-called &quot;retarded time&quot;, must be used, i.e. it is added to the argument of the current-density. Finally, as before, one integrates over the three primed space coordinates. (As usual &quot;c&quot; is the vacuum velocity of light.)

<text>Chhagan Bhujbal (born 15 October 1947) is an Indian politician from Maharashtra, who is the member of current Government of Maharashtra, headed by Devendra Fadnavis. Currently he is a member of 15th Legislative Assembly of Maharashtra from Yeola Assembly. He also served as the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra from 1999–December 2003 and 2009–2010. He earlier also served as Minister of Public Works Department and Minister of Home Affairs in Government of Maharashtra.

==Political career==
Before entering politics, Bhujbal was a vegetable vendor in Byculla Market where his mother had a small fruit shop.He started his political career with Shiv Sena in the 1960s. After being inspired by Shiv Sena philosophy of Balasaheb Thackeray, Bhujbal evolved into a hardcore Shiv Sainik. He was amongst initial members of the Shiv Sena. During his work as Corporator for the Mumbai corporation, Bhujbal maintained consistent contact, communication with rank and file of his constituency and its neighbourhood. Later, he was elected as Mayor of Mumbai twice. He was among the earliest MLAs of Shiv Sena elected from Mazgaon first in 1985 and again in 1990.

He left Shiv Sena in 1991 and joined the Indian National Congress. Later, after the Indian National Congress leader Sharad Pawar decided to split from the Congress and form his own party, the Nationalist Congress Party, Bhujbal went along with him.
Bhujbal contested 2014 General Elections from Nashik Constituency and lost the race to Hemant Godse from Shiv Sena.

Bhujbal is currently Member of Legislative Assembly from Yeola Constituency and has been incumbent since 2004.

Bhujbal belongs to an OBC community. He shares strong ties with Bihar politician Upendra Kushwaha. On various occasions, Kushwaha has spoken to media that he considers Bhujbal as well as Sharad Pawar as his mentor and relies on them for his political decisions.

Chhagan Bhujbal was born into a poor family in Nashik. He pursued his secondary and higher secondary education at Elphinstone Technical High School in Mumbai. Later, he obtained a diploma in Mechanical Engineering from VJTI, Mumbai. From a young age, he actively participated in agriculture and agriculture-related businesses while developing a strong interest in social and political affairs in the state.

== Private life ==
He is fluent in Hindi, Marathi, and English. He is married to Mrs. Meena Bhujbal, and they have one child. His son, Pankaj Bhujbal, is a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council.

== Enforcement Directorate proceedings ==
In December 2017, Enforcement Directorate attached assets worth 20.41 crore rupees belonging to the Bhujbal family under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

==Criticism==

===Allegations of deteriorating law and order situation in Nashik===
Nashik known to be a peaceful district, where law and order situation has collapsed under Bhujbals&#x27; political clout. It is witnessing recession in all sectors. Daylight robberies, armed attacks, chain-snatchings and setting of two- and four-wheelers on fire have become routine.

In view of the criticism of the home department, chief minister Prithviraj Chavan sent police commissioner Vinod Lokhande on leave for his dismal performance, while Samir Bhujbal demanded a CID probe into the collapse of law and order. But a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) official said that when each and every police official has been appointed on the family&#x27;s recommendations, why should the home department be blamed? Chhagan Bhujbal must accept responsibility and initiate measures to restore the people&#x27;s confidence.

However, any direct charges against Bhujbal concerning the law and order situation in Nashik could not be matched. 

===Alleged misuse and mismanagement of trust property===
In 2012, Mumbai Educational Trust (MET) filed a criminal complaint against Chhagan Bhujbal, alleging misuse and mismanagement of trust property for family-run furniture business and destruction of evidence in connection.

=== Attack on Alpha Marathi ===
On 23 Dec 2003, Chhagan Bhujbal resigned from the post of Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, owning the moral responsibility of attack on Alpha Marathi office in Andheri, Mumbai. A group of workers belonging to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) attacked the office of Alpha Marathi, which belongs to the Zee group. They were upset with the channel for airing a satire on Bhujbal&#x27;s alleged role in the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam. NCP president Sharad Pawar told the media on Tuesday night that Bhujbal had sought his permission to resign on moral grounds. Chhagan Bhujbal handed over his resignation to then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Sushilkumar Shinde.

<text>&quot;The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale&quot; () is among the best-known of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. It provides insight into the role of women in the Late Middle Ages and was probably of interest to Chaucer, himself, for the character is one of his most developed ones, with her Prologue twice as long as her Tale. He also goes so far as to describe two sets of clothing for her, in his General Prologue. She calls herself both Alyson and Alys in the prologue, but to confuse matters, these are also the names of her &#x27;gossip&#x27; (a close friend or gossip), whom she mentions several times, as well as many female characters throughout &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

Geoffrey Chaucer wrote the &quot;Prologue of the Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale&quot; during the fourteenth century, at a time when the social structure was rapidly evolving, during the reign of Richard II; it was not until the late 1380s to mid-1390s, when Richard&#x27;s subjects started to take notice of the way in which he was leaning toward bad counsel, causing criticism throughout his court. It was evident that changes needed to be made, within the traditional hierarchy at the court of Richard II; feminist reading of the tale argues that Chaucer chose to address through &quot;The Prologue of the Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale&quot; the change in mores that he had noticed, in order to highlight the imbalance of power within a male-dominated society. Women were identified not by their social status and occupations, but solely by their relations with men: a woman was defined as either a maiden, a spouse, or a widow – capable only of child-bearing, cooking and other &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot;.

The tale is often regarded as the first of the so-called &quot;marriage group&quot; of tales, which includes the Clerk&#x27;s, the Merchant&#x27;s and Franklin&#x27;s tales. But some scholars contest this grouping, first proposed by Chaucer scholar Eleanor Prescott Hammond and subsequently elaborated by George Lyman Kittredge, not least because the later tales of Melibee and the Nun&#x27;s Priest also discuss this theme. A separation between tales that deal with moral issues and ones that deal with magical issues, as the Wife of Bath&#x27;s does, is favoured by some scholars.

The tale is an example of the &quot;loathly lady&quot; motif, the oldest examples of which are the medieval Irish sovereignty myths such as that of Niall of the Nine Hostages. In the medieval poem, &quot;The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle&quot;, Arthur&#x27;s nephew, Gawain, goes on a nearly identical quest to discover what women truly want, after he errs in a land dispute, although, in contrast, he never stooped to despoliation or plunder, unlike the unnamed knight who raped the woman. By tradition, any knight or noble found guilty of such a transgression (abuse of power) might be stripped of his name, heraldic title and rights, and possibly even executed.

Jodi-Anne George suggests that the Wife&#x27;s tale may have been written to ease Chaucer&#x27;s guilty conscience. It is recorded that in 1380, associates of Chaucer stood surety for an amount equal to half his yearly salary for a charge brought by Cecily Champaign for &quot;de rapto,” rape or abduction; the same view has been taken of his &quot;Legend of Good Women&quot;, which Chaucer, himself, describes as a penance.

Scholarly work reported in October 2022 refutes this, stating that the court documents from 1380 have been misinterpreted and that mention of &quot;raptus&quot; were related to a labor dispute in which Chaucer hired a Cecily Chaumpaigne, before she was released from her previous employer.

== Synopsis ==

=== Prologue ===

The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Prologue is, by far, the longest in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; and is twice as long as the actual story, showing the importance of the prologue to the significance of the overall tale. In the beginning, the wife expresses her views in which she believes the morals of women are not merely that they all solely desire &quot;sovereignty,” but that each individual woman should have the opportunity to make the decision. The Wife of Bath speaks against many of the typical customs of the time, and provides her assessment of the roles of women in society.

The Wife of Bath particularly speaks out in defence of those who, like her, have married multiple times. As a counterargument, she mentions many holy men who have had multiple wives:

In this extract, she addresses why society should not look down on her or any other woman who has wed to multiple men, throughout their life. The tale confronts the double standard and the social belief in the inherent inferiority of women and tries to establish a defense of secular women&#x27;s sovereignty that opposes the conventions available to her.

=== Tale ===

The Wife of Bath&#x27;s tale, spoken by one who had been married 
five times, argues that women are morally identical to men who have also had more than one spouse. Double standards for men and women were common and deeply rooted in culture.

A knight in King Arthur&#x27;s time raped a fair young maiden. King Arthur issues a decree that the knight must be brought to justice. When the knight is captured, he is condemned to death, but Queen Guinevere intercedes, on his behalf, and she asks the King to allow her to pass judgment upon him. The Queen tells the knight that he will be spared his life, if he can discover, for her, what it is that women most desire, and she allots him a year and a day in which to roam wherever he pleases and return with an answer.

Everywhere the knight goes, he explains his predicament to the women he meets and asks their opinion, but &quot;No two of those he questioned answered the same.&quot; The answers range from fame and riches to play, or clothes, or sexual pleasure, or flattery, or freedom. When, at last, the time comes for him to return to the Court, he still lacks the answer he so desperately needs.

Outside a castle in the woods, he sees twenty-four maidens dancing and singing, but when he approaches, they disappear, as if by magic, and all that is left is an old woman. The Knight explains the problem to the old woman, who is wise and may know the answer, and she forces him to promise to grant any favour she might ask of him, in return. With no other options left, the Knight agrees. Arriving at the court, he gives the answer that women most desire sovereignty over their husbands, which is unanimously agreed to be true by the women of the court who, accordingly, free the Knight.

The old woman, then, explains to the court the deal she has struck with the Knight, and publicly requests his hand in marriage. Although aghast, he realizes he has no other choice and eventually agrees. On their wedding night, the old woman is upset that he is repulsed by her in bed. She reminds him that her looks can be an asset—she will be a virtuous wife to him, because no other men would desire her. She asks him which one he would prefer—an old and ugly wife who is true and loyal, or a beautiful and young woman, who may not be faithful. The Knight responds by saying that the choice is hers. Happy that she, now, has the ultimate power, he having taken to heart the lesson of sovereignty and relinquished control, rather than choosing for her, she promises him both beauty and fidelity. The Knight turns to look at the old woman, again, but now, he finds a young and lovely woman. The old woman makes &quot;what women want most&quot; and the answer that she gave true to him, sovereignty.

The Wife of Bath ends her tale by praying that Jesus Christ bless women with meek, young, and submissive husbands and the grace to break them.

== Themes ==
=== Feminist critique ===
The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Prologue simultaneously enumerates and critiques the long tradition of misogyny in ancient and medieval literature. As Cooper notes, the Wife of Bath&#x27;s &quot;materials are part of the vast medieval stock of antifeminism&quot;, giving St. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Adversus Jovinianum&quot;, which was &quot;written to refute the proposition put forward by one Jovinianus that virginity and marriage were of equal worth,” as one of many examples.

As author Ruth Evans notes in her book, &quot;Feminist Readings in Middle English Literature: the Wife of Bath and All her Sect,” the Wife of Bath embodies the ideology of &quot;sexual economics,&quot; wherein described as the &quot;psychological effects of economic necessity, specifically on sexual mores.&quot; The wife is described as a woman in the trade of textiles, she is neither upper-class or lower, strictly a middle-class woman living independently off her own profit. The Wife of Bath sees the economics of marriage as a profitable business endeavor, based solely on supply and demand: she sells her body, in marriage, and in return, she is given money in the form of titles and inheritance. She is both the broker and commodity in this arrangement.

The Wife of Bath&#x27;s first marriage occurred at the age of twelve, which highlights the lack of control that girls and women women had over their own bodies in medieval Europe, as children were often bartered, in marriage, to increase family status. By choosing her next husbands and subsequently &quot;selling herself,&quot; she regains some semblance of control and ownership over her body, and the profit is solely hers to keep.

The simple fact that she is a widow who has remarried more than once radically defies medieval conventions. Further evidence of this can be found through her observation: &quot;For hadde, God commanded maydenhede, / Thanne hadde he dampned weddyng with the dede.&quot; She refutes Jerome&#x27;s proposition, concerning virginity and marriage, by noting that God would have condemned marriage and procreation, if He had commanded virginity. Her decision to include God, as a defence for her lustful appetites, is significant, as it shows how well-read she is. By the same token, her interpretations of Scripture, such as Paul on marriage, are tailored to suit her own purposes. 

While Chaucer&#x27;s Wife of Bath is clearly familiar with the many ancient and medieval views on proper female behavior, she also boldly questions their validity. Her repeated acts of remarriage, for instance, are an example of how she mocks &quot;clerical teaching concerning the remarriage of widows&quot;. Furthermore, she adds, &quot;a rich widow was considered to be a match equal to, or more desirable than, a match with a virgin of property&quot;, illustrating this point by elaborating, at length, concerning her ability to remarry four times, and attract a much younger man.

While she gleefully confesses to the many ways in which she falls short of conventional ideals for women, she also points out that it is men who constructed those ideals, in the first place.
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Who painted the lion, tell me who?
By God, if women had written stories,
As clerks have within their studies,
They would have written of men more wickedness
Than all the male sex could set right.
&lt;/poem&gt;

That does not, however, mean they are not correct, and after her critique she accepts their validity.

=== Behaviour in marriage ===
Both Carruthers and Cooper reflect on the way that Chaucer&#x27;s Wife of Bath does not behave as society dictates, in any of her marriages. Through her nonconformity to the expectations of her role as a wife, the audience is shown what proper behaviour, in marriage, should be like. Carruthers&#x27; essay outlines the existence of deportment books, the purpose of which was to teach women how to be model wives. Carruthers notes how the Wife&#x27;s behaviour in the first of her marriages &quot;is almost everything the deportment-book writers say it should not be.&quot; For example, she lies to her old husbands about them getting drunk and saying some regrettable things. Yet, Carruthers does note that the Wife does do a decent job of upholding her husbands&#x27; public honour. Moreover, deportment books taught women that &quot;the husband deserves control of the wife, because he controls the estate&quot;; it is clear that the Wife is the one who controls certain aspects of her husband&#x27;s behaviour in her various marriages.

Cooper also notes that behaviour, in marriage, is a theme that emerges in the Wife of Bath&#x27;s Prologue; neither the Wife nor her husbands conform to any conventional ideals of marriage. Cooper observes that the Wife&#x27;s fifth husband, in particular, &quot;cannot be taken as any principle of correct Christian marriage&quot;. He, too, fails to exhibit behaviour conventionally expected within a marriage. This can, perhaps, be attributed to his young age and lack of experience in relationships, as he does change at the end, as does the Wife of Bath. Thus, through both the Wife&#x27;s and her fifth and favorite husband&#x27;s failure to conform to expected behaviour in marriage, the poem exposes the complexity of the institution of marriage and of relationships, more broadly.

=== Female sovereignty ===
As Cooper argues, the tension between experience and textual authority is central to the Prologue. The Wife argues for the relevance of her own marital experience. For instance, she notes that:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Unnethe myghte they the statut holde 
In which that they were bounden unto me. 
Ye woot wel what I meene of this, pardee! 
As help me God, I laughe whan I thynke
How pitously a-nyght I made hem swynke! (III.204–08) 
&lt;/poem&gt;
The Wife of Bath&#x27;s first three husbands are depicted as subservient men who cater to her sexual appetites. Her characterisation as domineering is particularly evident in the following passage:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Of tribulacion in mariage,
Of which I am expert in al myn age
This is to seyn, myself have been the whippe. (III.179–81)
&lt;/poem&gt;
The image of the whip underlines her dominant role as the partnership; she tells everyone that she is the one in charge in her household, especially in the bedroom, where she appears to have an insatiable thirst for sex; the result is a satirical, lascivious depiction of a woman, but also of feudal power arrangements.

However, the end of both the Prologue and the Tale make evident that it is not dominance that she wishes to gain, in her relation with her husband, but a kind of equality.

In the Prologue, she says: &quot;God help me so, I was to him as kinde/ As any wyf from Denmark unto Inde,/ And also trewe, and so was he to me.&quot; In her Tale, the old woman tells her husband: &quot;I prey to God that I mot sterven wood,/ But I to yow be also good and trewe/ As evere was wyf, sin that the world was newe.&quot;

In both cases, the Wife says so to the husband, after she has been given &quot;sovereyntee.” She is handed over the control of all the property, along with the control of her husband&#x27;s tongue. The old woman in the Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale is also given the freedom to choose which role he wishes her to play in the marriage.

=== Economics of love ===
In her essay &quot;The Wife of Bath and the Painting of Lions,&quot; Carruthers describes the relationship that existed between love and economics for both medieval men and women. Carruthers notes that it is the independence that the Wife&#x27;s wealth provides for her that allows her to love freely. This implies that autonomy is an important component in genuine love, and since autonomy can only be achieved through wealth, wealth, then, becomes the greatest component for true love. Love can, in essence, be bought: Chaucer makes reference to this notion, when he has the Wife tell one of her husbands:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Is it for ye wolde have my queynte allone? 
Wy, taak it al! Lo, have it every deel! 
Peter! I shrewe yow, but ye love it weel; 
For if I wolde selle my bele chose, 
I koude walke as fressh as is a rose;
But I wol kepe it for youre owene tooth. (III.444–49) 
&lt;/poem&gt;
The Wife appears to make reference to prostitution, whereby &quot;love&quot; in the form of sex is a &quot;deal,&quot; bought and sold. The character&#x27;s use of words, such as &quot;dette (debt)&quot; and &quot;paiement (payment)&quot; also portray love in economic terms, as did the medieval Church: sex was the debt women owed to the men that they married. Hence, while the point that Carruthers makes is that money is necessary for women to achieve sovereignty in marriage, a look at the text reveals that love is, among other things, an economic concept. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that her fifth husband gives up wealth, in return for love, honour, and respect.

The Wife of Bath does take men seriously and wants them for more than just sexual pleasure and money. When the Wife of Bath states, &quot;but well I know, surely, God expressly instructed us to increase and multiply. I can well understand that noble text&quot; to bear fruit, not in children, but financially through marriage, land, and from inheritance when her husbands die; Chaucer&#x27;s Wife chose to interpret the meaning of the statement by clarifying that she has no interest in childbearing, as a means of showing fruitfulness, but the progression of her financial stability is her ideal way of proving success.

=== Sex and Lollardy ===
While sexuality is a dominant theme in The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Prologue, it is less obvious that her sexual behaviour can be associated with Lollardy. Critics such as Helen Cooper and Carolyn Dinshaw point to the link between sex and Lollardy. Both describe the Wife&#x27;s knowledge and use of Scripture, in her justification of her sexual behaviour. When she states that &quot;God bad us for to wexe and multiplye&quot;, she appears to suggest that there is nothing wrong with sexual lust, because God wants humans to procreate. The Wife&#x27;s &quot;emphatic determination to recuperate sexual activity, within a Christian context, and on the authority of the Bible [on a number of occasions throughout the text] echoes one of the points made in the Lollard &quot;Twelve Conclusions&quot; of 1395&quot;. The very fact that she remarries, after the death of her first husband, could be viewed as Chaucer&#x27;s characterisation of the Wife as a supporter of Lollardy, if not necessarily a Lollard, herself, since Lollards advocated the remarriage of widows.

Author Alistair Minnis makes the assertion that the Wife of Bath is not a Lollard, at all, but was educated by her late husband, Jankyn, an Oxford-educated clerk, who translated and read aloud anti-feminist texts. Jankyn gave her knowledge far beyond what was available to women of her status, which explains how she can hold her own, when justifying her sexual behavior to the Canterbury group. Further, Minnis explains that &quot;being caught in possession of a woman&#x27;s body, so to speak, was an offense, in itself, carrying the penalty of a life-sentence&quot;, showing a perception that in medieval Europe, women could not hold priestly duties on the basis of their sex and no matter how flawless her moral status was, her body would always bar her from the ability to preach the word of God. Minnis goes on to say that &quot;it might well be concluded that it was better to be a secret sinner than a woman,&quot; as a sinful man could always change his behavior and repent, but a woman could not change her sex.

=== Femininity ===
In an effort to assert women&#x27;s equality with men, the Wife of Bath states that an equal balance of power is needed, in a functional society. Wilks proposes that through the sovereignty theme, a reflection of women&#x27;s integral role in governance compelled Chaucer&#x27;s audience to associate the Wife&#x27;s tale with the reign of Anne of Bohemia. By questioning universal assumptions of male dominance, making demands in her own right, conducting negotiations within her marriages, and disregarding conventional feminine ideals, Chaucer&#x27;s Wife of Bath was ahead of her time.

=== The Queen&#x27;s Law ===
The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale reverses the medieval roles of men and women (especially regarding legal power), and it also suggests a theme of feminist coalition-building. Appointed as sovereign and judge over the convicted knight, the Queen holds a type of power given to men in the world outside the tale. She has power, as judge over the knight&#x27;s life. Author Emma Lipton writes that the Queen uses this power to move from a liberal court to an educational court. In this sense, the court is moving beyond punishment for the offense, and it, now, puts a meaning behind the offense, tying it to consequences. In the tale, the Queen is a figurehead for a feminist movement, within a society that looks much like the misogynistic world in which the Canterbury Tales are told. From this tale&#x27;s feminist notion that the Queen leads, women are empowered, rather than objectified. The effect of feminist coalition-building can be seen through the knight. As a consequence for the knight&#x27;s sexual assault against the maiden, when the old woman asks the Queen to allow the knight to marry her, the Queen grants it. This shows support for the broader female community&#x27;s commitment to education in female values. In response to this fate, the knight begs the court and the Queen to undo his sentence, offering all his wealth and power: &quot;Take all my goods, and let my body go,&quot; which the Queen does not allow. The knight&#x27;s lack of agency, in this scene, demonstrates a role reversal, according to Carissa Harris, in juxtaposition to women&#x27;s lack of agency in situations of rape.

==Adaptations==
Pasolini adapted the prologue of this tale in his film &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Laura Betti plays the wife of Bath and Tom Baker plays her fifth husband.

Zadie Smith adapted and updated the prologue and story for the Kiln Theatre in Kilburn in 2019 as &quot;The Wife of Willesden&quot;, a play which ran from November 2021 to January 2022.

Karen Brookes has written a book based on the tale, &quot;The Good Wife of Bath&quot;, as has Chaucer scholar Marion Turner in &quot;The Wife of Bath: A Biography&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Cook&#x27;s Tale&quot; is one of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer. It breaks off after 58 lines and was presumably never finished, although some scholars argue that Chaucer deliberately left the tale unfinished. 

==Prologue==
The Cook (Roger) starts by commenting on the Reeve&#x27;s tale and then, after a reference to Solomon, asks for his listeners to attend while he tells of a trick that was played in his city (Lines 1 – 19). The host then invites the cook to tell his tale (Lines 20 – 40). 

== Plot ==
The story starts telling of an apprentice named Perkyn (a.k.a. Perkin) who is fond of drinking and dancing. Perkyn is released by his master and moves in with a friend who also loves to drink, and whose wife is a &quot;shopkeeper&quot; whose real occupation is that of a prostitute.

After the tale, The Host later calls upon the Cook for another, but he is too drunk and, after he falls from his horse and is helped back up, the Manciple tells a tale.

== Analysis ==
The tale continues the general downward trend of the preceding tales—the Knight&#x27;s, the Miller&#x27;s and the Reeve&#x27;s tale—into ever-more-seedy stories. Its length makes finding a source impossible, but it is thought by some scholars to be a retelling of contemporary events, with a Roger Knight de Ware being mentioned in several manuscripts of the time.

In 25 of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; MSS (notably Harley MS 7334 and Corpus Christi 198) the Cook&#x27;s unfinished tale is followed by the anonymous Tale of Gamelyn, and it has been suggested that Chaucer intended to rewrite the tale for the Cook. There is, however, no other connection of Gamelyn with Chaucer and the great difference in tone between that tale and the one the Cook starts suggests that it was inserted by the scribes who copied the manuscripts. Skeat argued instead that Chaucer intended the tale for the Yeoman, who would presumably be more interested in a tale of country life.

==Adaptations==
Pasolini adapted this story in his film The Canterbury Tales. He greatly expanded on the story which is very short at only 58 lines. Ninetto Davoli stars as Perkin. The story includes a lot of slapstick humor and homages the films of Charlie Chaplin.

== Influences ==
A renowned chef, Dev Biswal, renamed his Canterbury restaurant from &#x27;The Ambrette&#x27; to &#x27;Cook&#x27;s Tale&#x27;, in a tribute to the Chaucerian character. The tasting menu features such medieval delights as &quot;Ypocras, fortified Kentish wine served with cake; Wastel breed with flavoured beef drippings; Pyk in Brasey; Pigeon with wortes and marybones; Salat of Sawge with Chybollus, Pesen Pottage; Mushroom bake with fecces; Tamworth pork mortreux, Venysoun with roasted chasteynes and Walsh-notes; and poached peres; and Chese.&quot;

<doc id="404193" wikidata="Q849176" url="?curid=404193" title="Kościuszko Uprising">
<text>The Kościuszko Uprising, also known as the Polish Uprising of 1794, Second Polish War, Polish Campaign of 1794, and the Polish Revolution of 1794, was an uprising against the Russian and Prussian influence on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, led by Tadeusz Kościuszko in Poland-Lithuania and the Prussian partition in 1794. It was a failed attempt to liberate the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from external influence after the Second Partition of Poland (1793) and the creation of the Targowica Confederation.

==Background==

===Decline of the Commonwealth===
By the early 18th century, the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state – or rather, they managed to ensure that no reforms would be carried out that might weaken their privileged status (the &quot;Golden Freedoms&quot;). Through the abuse of the &quot;liberum veto&quot; rule which enabled any deputy to paralyze the Sejm (Commonwealth&#x27;s parliament) proceedings, deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers or those simply content to believe they were living in an unprecedented &quot;Golden Age&quot;, paralysed the Commonwealth&#x27;s government for over a century.

The idea of reforming the Commonwealth gained traction starting from the mid-17th century. It was, however, viewed with suspicion not only by its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which were content with the deterioration of the Commonwealth and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directly (The Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000; The Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army, 200,000 each).

===Attempts at reform===
A major opportunity for reform presented itself during the &quot;Great Sejm&quot; of 1788–92. Poland&#x27;s neighbors were preoccupied with wars and unable to intervene forcibly in Polish affairs. Russia and Austria were engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War, 1787–1792 and the Austro-Turkish War, 1787–1791); the Russians also found themselves simultaneously fighting in the Russo-Swedish War, 1788–1790. A new alliance between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Prussia seemed to provide security against Russian intervention, and on 3 May 1791 the new constitution was read and adopted to overwhelming popular support.

With the wars between Turkey and Russia and Sweden and Russia having ended, Empress Catherine was furious over the adoption of the new constitution, which she believed threatened Russian influence in Poland. Russia had viewed Poland as a &quot;de facto&quot; protectorate. &quot;The worst possible news has arrived from Warsaw: the Polish king has become almost sovereign&quot; was the reaction of one of Russia&#x27;s chief foreign policy authors, Alexander Bezborodko, when he learned of the new constitution. Prussia was also strongly opposed to the new constitution, and Polish diplomats received a note that the new constitution changed the Polish state so much that Prussia did not consider its obligations binding. Just like Russia, Prussia was concerned that the newly strengthened Polish state could become a threat and the Prussian foreign minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, clearly and with rare candor told the Poles that Prussia did not support the constitution and refused to help the Commonwealth in any form, even as a mediator, as it was not in Prussia&#x27;s state interest to see the Commonwealth strengthened as it could threaten Prussia in the future. The Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: &quot;The Poles have given the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution&quot;, elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand the return of the lands Prussia acquired in the First Partition.

===Second Partition of Poland===
The Constitution was not adopted without dissent in the Commonwealth itself, either. Magnates who had opposed the constitution draft from the start, namely Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, Seweryn Rzewuski, and Szymon and Józef Kossakowski, asked Tsaritsa Catherine to intervene and restore their privileges such as the Russian-guaranteed Cardinal Laws abolished under the new statute. To that end these magnates formed the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation&#x27;s proclamation, prepared in St. Petersburg in January 1792, criticized the constitution for contributing to, in their own words, &quot;contagion of democratic ideas&quot; following &quot;the fatal examples set in Paris&quot;. It asserted that &quot;The parliament ... has broken all fundamental laws, swept away all liberties of the gentry and on the third of May 1791 turned into a revolution and a conspiracy.&quot; The Confederates declared an intention to overcome this revolution. We &quot;can do nothing but turn trustingly to Tsarina Catherine, a distinguished and fair empress, our neighboring friend and ally&quot;, who &quot;respects the nation&#x27;s need for well-being and always offers it a helping hand&quot;, they wrote. The Confederates aligned with Catherine and asked her for military intervention. On 18 May 1792 the Russian ambassador to Poland, Yakov Bulgakov, delivered a declaration of war to Polish Foreign Minister Joachim Chreptowicz. Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania on the same day, starting the Polish–Russian War of 1792. The war ended without any decisive battles, with a capitulation signed by Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski, who hoped that a diplomatic compromise could be worked out.

King Poniatowski&#x27;s hopes that the capitulation would allow an acceptable diplomatic solution to be worked out were soon dashed. With new deputies bribed or intimidated by the Russian troops, a new session of parliament, known as the Grodno Sejm, took place, in fall 1793. On 23 November 1793, it concluded its deliberations under duress, annulling the constitution and acceding to the Second Partition. Russia took , while Prussia took of the Commonwealth&#x27;s territory. This event reduced Poland&#x27;s population to only one-third of what it was before the partitions began in 1772. The rump state was garrisoned by Russian troops and its independence was strongly curtailed. Such an outcome was a giant blow for the members of the Targowica Confederation, who saw their actions as a defense of the centuries-old privileges of the magnates, but now were regarded by the majority of the Polish population as traitors.

===Growing unrest===
The Polish military was widely dissatisfied with the capitulation, most commanders considering it premature; Tadeusz Kościuszko, Prince Józef Poniatowski and many others would criticize the king&#x27;s decision and many, including Kościuszko, resigned their commission shortly afterward. After the Commonwealth defeat in that war and the rescinding of the Constitution, the Army was reduced to about 36,000. In 1794 Russians demanded a further downsizing of the army to 15,000. The dissent in the Polish Army was one of the sparks that would lead to the coming conflict.

The King&#x27;s capitulation was a hard blow for Kościuszko, who had not lost a single battle in the campaign. By mid September he was resigned to leave the country, and he departed Warsaw in early October. Kościuszko settled in Leipzig, where many other notable Polish commanders and politicians formed an émigrée community. Soon he and some others began preparing an uprising against Russian rule in Poland. The politicians, grouped around Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj, sought contacts with similar opposition groups formed in Poland and by spring 1793 had been joined by other politicians and revolutionaries, including Ignacy Działyński. While Kołłątaj and others had begun planning for the uprising before meeting Kościuszko, his support was a major boon for them, as he was, at that time, among the most popular individuals in the entire Poland.

In August 1793 Kościuszko returned to Leipzig where he was met with demands to start planning for the uprising; however, he was worried that an uprising would have little chance against the three partitioners. In September he would clandestinely cross the Polish border to conduct personal observations, and to meet some sympathetic high-ranking officers in the remaining Polish Army, including general Józef Wodzicki. The preparations in Poland were slow and he decided to postpone the outbreak, and left for Italy, planning to return in February. However, the situation in Poland was changing rapidly. The Russian and Prussian governments forced Poland to again disband the majority of her armed forces and the reduced units were to be drafted into the Russian army. Also, in March the tsarist agents discovered the group of revolutionaries in Warsaw and started arresting notable Polish politicians and military commanders. Kościuszko was forced to execute his plan earlier than expected, and on 15 March 1794 he set off for Kraków.

On 12 March 1794, General Antoni Madaliński, the commander of 1st Greater Polish National Cavalry Brigade (1,500 men) decided to disobey the order to demobilise, advancing his troops from Ostrołęka to Kraków. This sparked an outbreak of riots against Russian forces throughout the country. The Russian garrison of Kraków was ordered to leave the city and confront Madalinski, which left Kraków completely undefended, but also foiled Kosciuszko&#x27;s plan to seize their weapons.

On 24 March 1794, Tadeusz Kościuszko, a veteran of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, announced the general uprising in a speech in the Kraków town square and assumed the powers of the Commander in Chief of all of the Polish forces. He also vowed
In order to strengthen the Polish forces, Kościuszko issued an act of mobilisation, requiring that every 5 houses in Lesser Poland delegate at least one able male soldier equipped with &quot;carbine, pike, or an axe&quot;. Kościuszko&#x27;s Commission for Order in Kraków recruited all males between 18 and 28 years of age and passed an income tax. The difficulties with providing enough armament for the mobilised troops made Kościuszko form large units composed of peasants armed with scythes, called the &quot;scythemen&quot;.
To destroy the still weak opposition, Russian Empress Catherine the Great ordered the corps of Major General Fiodor Denisov to attack Kraków. On 4 April both armies met near the village of Racławice. In what became known as the Battle of Racławice Kościuszko&#x27;s forces defeated the technically superior opponent. After the bloody battle the Russian forces withdrew from the battlefield. Kościuszko&#x27;s forces were too weak to start a successful pursuit and wipe the Russian forces out of Lesser Poland. Although the strategic importance of the victory was close to none, the news of the victory spread fast and soon other parts of Poland joined the ranks of the revolutionaries. By early April the Polish forces concentrated in the lands of Lublin and Volhynia, ready to be sent to Russia, joined the ranks of Kościuszko&#x27;s forces.

On 17 April in Warsaw, the Russian attempt to arrest those suspected of supporting the insurrection and to disarm the weak Polish garrison of Warsaw under Gen. Stanisław Mokronowski by seizing the arsenal at Miodowa Street resulted in an uprising against the Russian garrison of Warsaw, led by Jan Kiliński, in the face of indecisiveness of the King of Poland, Stanisław II Augustus. The insurgents were aided by the incompetence of Russian ambassador and commander, Iosif Igelström, and the chosen day being the Thursday of Holy Week when many soldiers of the Russian garrison went to the churches for the Eucharist not carrying their arms. Finally, from the onset of the insurrection, the Polish forces were aided by the civilian population and had surprise on their side as they attacked many separate groups of soldiers at the same time and the resistance to Russian forces quickly spread over the city. After two days of heavy fighting the Russians, who suffered between 2,000 and 4,000 casualties out of an initial 5,000 strong garrison, were forced to leave the city. A similar uprising was started by Jakub Jasiński in Vilnius on 23 April and soon other cities and towns followed.

On 7 May 1794, Kościuszko issued an act that became known as the &quot;Proclamation of Połaniec&quot;, in which he partially abolished serfdom in Poland, granted civil liberty to all peasants and provided them with state help against abuses by the nobility. Although the new law never fully came into being and was boycotted by much of the nobility, it also attracted many peasants to the ranks of the revolutionaries. It was the first time in Polish history that the peasants were officially regarded as part of the &quot;nation&quot;, the word being previously equivalent to &quot;nobility&quot;.

Despite the promise of reforms and quick recruitment of new forces, the strategic situation of the Polish forces, which consisted of 6,000 peasants, cavalry, and 9,000 soldiers, was still critical. On 10 May the forces of Prussia (17,500 soldiers under General Francis Favrat), crossed the Polish borders and joined the 9,000 Russian soldiers operating in northern Poland. On 6 June Kościuszko was defeated in the Battle of Szczekociny by a joint Russo-Prussian force and on 8 June General Józef Zajączek was defeated in the Battle of Chełm. Polish forces withdrew towards Warsaw and started to fortify the city under directions from Kosciuszko and his 16,000 soldiers, 18,000 peasants and 15,000 burghers. On 15 June the Prussian army captured Kraków unopposed. Warsaw was besieged by 41,000 Russians under General Ivan Fersen and 25,000 Prussians under King Frederick William II of Prussia on 13 July. On 20 August, an uprising in Greater Poland started and the Prussians were forced to withdraw their forces from Warsaw. The siege was lifted by 6 September when the Prussians and Russians had both withdrawn their troops.
Although the opposition in Lithuania was crushed by Russian forces (Vilnius was besieged and capitulated on 12 August), the uprising in Greater Poland achieved some success. A Polish corps under Jan Henryk Dąbrowski captured Bydgoszcz (2 October) and entered Pomerania almost unopposed. Thanks to the mobility of his forces, General Dąbrowski evaded being encircled by a much less mobile Prussian army and disrupted the Prussian lines, forcing the Prussians to withdraw most of their forces from central Poland. However, the Poles did not stay long in Prussian territories, and soon retreated to Central Poland.

Meanwhile, the Russians equipped a new corps commanded by General Aleksandr Suvorov and ordered it to join up with the corps under Ivan Fersen near Warsaw. After the Battle of Krupczyce (17 September) and the Battle of Terespol (19 September), the new army started its march towards Warsaw. Trying to prevent both Russian armies from joining up, Kościuszko mobilised two regiments from Warsaw and with General Sierakowski&#x27;s 5,000 soldiers, engaged Fersen&#x27;s force of 14,000 on 10 October in the Battle of Maciejowice. Kościuszko was wounded in the battle and was captured by the Russians, who sent him to Saint Petersburg.

The new commander of the uprising, Tomasz Wawrzecki, could not control the spreading internal struggles for power and ultimately became only the commander of weakened military forces, while the political power was held by General Józef Zajączek, who in turn had to struggle with both the leftist liberal Polish Jacobins and the rightist and monarchical nobility.

Suvorov&#x27;s troops grew angry due to resistance and also due to tales of atrocities committed against Russian troops in the spring, leading to Suvorov&#x27;s army to commit to an assault. On 4 November, the joint Russian forces started the Battle of Praga, after the name of the right-bank suburb of Warsaw where it took place. After four hours of brutal hand-to-hand fighting, the 22,000-strong Russian forces broke through the Polish defences and Suvorov allowed his Cossacks to loot and burn Warsaw. By one Russian estimate, approximately 20,000 were murdered in the Praga massacre; the number includes both military personnel and civilians. Zajaczek fled wounded, abandoning the Polish army.

On 16 November, near Radoszyce, Wawrzecki surrendered. This marked the end of the uprising. The power of Poland was broken and the following year the third partition of Poland took place, after which Austria, Russia and Prussia annexed the remainder of the country.

==Aftermath==
The uprising was bloodily suppressed, the Polish rebels lost 27,000 and the Russians 4,080.
After the failure of the Kościuszko Uprising, Poland ceased to exist for 123 years, and all of its institutions were gradually banned by the partitioning powers. However, the uprising also marked the start of modern political thought in Poland and Central Europe. Kościuszko&#x27;s Proclamation of Połaniec and the radical leftist Jacobins started the Polish leftist movement. Many prominent Polish politicians who were active during the uprising became the backbone of Polish politics, both at home and abroad, in the 19th century. Also, Prussia had much of its forces tied up in Poland and could not field enough forces to suppress the French Revolution, which added to its success and briefly restored a Polish state.

In the lands of partitioned Poland, the failure of the uprising meant economic catastrophe, as centuries-old economic markets became divided and separated from each other, resulting in the collapse of trade. Several banks fell and some of the few manufacturing centres established in the Commonwealth were closed. Reforms made by the reformers and Kosciuszko, aimed at easing serfdom, were revoked. All the partitioning powers heavily taxed their newly acquired lands, filling their treasuries at the expense of the local population.

The schooling system was also degraded as the schools in those territories were given low priority. The Commission of National Education, the world&#x27;s first Ministry of Education, was abolished, because the absolutist governments of the partitioning powers saw no gain in investing in education in the territories inhabited by restless Polish minorities. The creation of educational institutions in the partitions became very difficult. For example, an attempt to create a university in Warsaw was opposed by the Prussian authorities. Further, in the German and Russian partitions, all remaining centers of learning were subject to Germanisation and Russification; only in territories acquired by Austria was there relatively little governmental intervention in the curriculum. According to S. I. Nikołajew, from the cultural point of view the partitions may have given a step forward towards the development of national Polish literature and arts, since the inhabitants of partitioned lands could acquire the cultural developments of German and Russian Enlightenment.

The conditions for the former Polish elite were particularly harsh in Russian partition. Thousands of Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; families who supported Kościuszo&#x27;s uprising were stripped of their possessions and estates, which were awarded to Russian generals and favourites of the St. Petersburg court. It is estimated that 650,000 former Polish serfs were transferred to Russian officials in this manner. Some among the nobility, especially in Lithuanian and Ruthenian regions of the former Commonwealth, were expelled to southern Russia, where they were subject to Russification. Other nobles were denied their nobility status by Russian authorities, which meant loss of legal privileges and social status, significantly limiting any possibility of a career in administration or the military - the traditional career paths of Polish nobles. It also meant that they could not own any land, another blow to their former noble status. But for Orthodox Christian peasants of Western Ukraine and Belarus, the partition may have brought the decline of religious oppression by their formal lords, followers of Roman Catholicism.

However, Orthodox Christians were only a small minority in Eastern Belarus at that time; the prevailing majority of the country&#x27;s population was Eastern rite Catholics. Peasants were flogged just for mentioning the name of Kościuszko and his idea of abolishing serfdom. Platon Zubov, who was awarded estates in Lithuania, was especially infamous, as he personally tortured to death many peasants who complained about worsening conditions. Besides this, the Russian authorities conducted heavy recruiting for the Russian army among the population, which meant a practically lifelong service. Since the conditions of serfdom in former Poland due to the exploitation by nobility and arendators were already severe, discussion exists on how partitions influenced the life of common people.

<text>The Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) is an art museum originally chartered in 1876 for the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The main museum building was completed in 1928 on Fairmount, a hill located at the northwest end of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway at Eakins Oval. The museum administers collections containing over 240,000 objects including major holdings of European, American and Asian origin. The various classes of artwork include sculpture, paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, armor, and decorative arts.

The Philadelphia Museum of Art administers several annexes including the Rodin Museum, also located on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, and the Ruth and Raymond G. Perelman Building, which is located across the street just north of the main building. The Perelman Building, which opened in 2007, houses more than 150,000 prints, drawings and photographs, 30,000 costume and textile pieces, and over 1,000 modern and contemporary design objects including furniture, ceramics, and glasswork.

The museum also administers the historic colonial-era houses of Mount Pleasant and Cedar Grove, both located in Fairmount Park. The main museum building and its annexes are owned by the City of Philadelphia and administered by a registered nonprofit corporation.

Several special exhibitions are held in the museum every year, including touring exhibitions arranged with other museums in the United States and abroad. The museum had 437,348 visitors in 2021.

==History==
===Early years (1877–1900)===
Philadelphia celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence with the Centennial Exposition in 1876. Memorial Hall, which contained the art gallery, was intended to outlast the Exposition and house a permanent museum. Following the example of London&#x27;s South Kensington Museum, the new museum was to focus on applied art and science, and provide a school to train craftsmen in drawing, painting, modeling, and designing.

The Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art opened on May 10, 1877. The school became independent of the museum in 1964 and is now part of the University of the Arts. The museum&#x27;s collection began with objects from the Exposition and gifts from the public impressed with the Exposition&#x27;s ideals of good design and craftsmanship. European and Japanese fine and decorative art objects and books for the museum&#x27;s library were among the first donations. The location outside of Center City, Philadelphia, however, was fairly distant from many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants. Admission was charged until 1881, then was dropped until 1962.

Starting in 1882, Clara Jessup Moore donated a remarkable collection of antique furniture, enamels, carved ivory, jewelry, metalwork, glass, ceramics, books, textiles and paintings. The Countess de Brazza&#x27;s lace collection was acquired in 1894 forming the nucleus of the lace collection. In 1892 Anna H. Wilstach bequeathed a large painting collection, including many American paintings, and an endowment of half a million dollars for additional purchases. Works by James Abbott McNeill Whistler and George Inness were purchased within a few years and Henry Ossawa Tanner&#x27;s &quot;The Annunciation&quot; was bought in 1899.

===Construction of the main building (1895–1933)===

The City Council of Philadelphia funded a competition in 1895 to design a new museum building, but it was not until 1907 that plans were first made to construct it on Fairmount, a rocky hill topped by the city&#x27;s main reservoir. The Fairmount Parkway (renamed Benjamin Franklin Parkway), a grand boulevard that cut diagonally across the grid of city streets, was designed to terminate at the foot of the hill. But there were conflicting views about whether to erect a single museum building, or a number of buildings to house individual collections.

Horace Trumbauer and Zantzinger, Borie and Medary, both architectural firms, collaborated for more than a decade to resolve these issues. The final design is mostly credited to two architects in Trumbauer&#x27;s firm: Howell Lewis Shay for the building&#x27;s plan and massing, and Julian Abele for the detail work and perspective drawings. In 1902, Abele had become the first African-American student to be graduated from the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Department of Architecture, which is presently known as Penn&#x27;s School of Design. Abele adapted classical Greek temple columns for the design of the museum entrances, and was responsible for the colors of both the building stone and the figures added to one of the pediments.

Construction of the main building began in 1919, when Mayor Thomas B. Smith laid the cornerstone in a Masonic ceremony. Because of shortages caused by World War I and other delays, the new building was not completed until 1928. The building was constructed with dolomite quarried in Minnesota. The wings were intentionally built first, to help assure the continued funding for the completion of the design. Once the building&#x27;s exterior was completed, twenty second-floor galleries containing English and American art opened to the public on March 26, 1928, though a large amount of interior work was incomplete.
The building&#x27;s eight pediments were intended to be adorned with sculpture groups. The only pediment that has been completed, &quot;Western Civilization&quot; (1933) by C. Paul Jennewein, colored by Leon V. Solon, features polychrome sculptures of painted terra-cotta figures depicting Greek deities and mythological figures. The sculpture group was awarded the Medal of Honor of the Architectural League of New York.

The building is also adorned by a collection of bronze griffins, which were later adopted as the symbol of the museum in the 1970s.

===Membership program and growth (1928–1976)===

In the early 1900s, the museum started an education program for the general public, as well as a membership program. Fiske Kimball was the museum director during the rapid growth of the mid- to late-1920s, which included one million visitors in 1928—the new building&#x27;s first year. The museum enlarged its print collection in 1928 with about 5,000 Old Master prints and drawings from the gift of Charles M. Lea, including French, German, Italian, and Netherlandish engravings. Major exhibitions of the 1930s included works by Eakins, Manet, Renoir, Cézanne, van Gogh, and Degas.

In the 1940s, the museum&#x27;s major gifts and acquisitions included the collections of John D. McIlhenny (Oriental carpets), George Grey Barnard (sculpture), and Alfred Stieglitz (photography).

Early modern art dominated the growth of the collections in the 1950s, with acquisitions of the Louise and Walter Arensberg and the A.E. Gallatin collections. The gift of Philadelphian Grace Kelly&#x27;s wedding dress is perhaps the best known gift of the 1950s.

Extensive renovation of the building lasted from the 1960s through 1976. Major acquisitions included the Carroll S. Tyson Jr. and Samuel S. White III and Vera White collections, 71 objects from designer Elsa Schiaparelli, and Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Étant donnés&quot;. In 1976 there were celebrations and special exhibitions for the centennial of the museum and the bicentennial of the nation. During the last three decades major acquisitions have included &quot;After the Bath&quot; by Edgar Degas and &quot;Fifty Days at Iliam&quot; by Cy Twombly.

=== Building expansion (2004–present) ===

Due to high attendance and overflowing collections, the museum announced in October 2006 that Frank Gehry would design a building expansion. The gallery will be built entirely underground behind the east entrance stairs and will not alter any of the museum&#x27;s existing Greek revival facade. The construction was initially projected to last a decade and cost $500 million. It will increase the museum&#x27;s available display space by sixty percent and house mostly contemporary sculpture, Asian art, and special exhibitions.

Uncertainty was cast on the plans by the 2008 death of Anne d&#x27;Harnoncourt, but new director Timothy Rub, who had initiated a $350 million expansion at the Cleveland Museum of Art, will be carrying out the plans as scheduled. In 2010, Gehry attended the groundbreaking for the second phase of the expansion, due to be completed in 2012. In that phase, a new art handling facility was created on the south side of the building, enabling the museum to reclaim a street level entrance, closed since the mid-1970s, which leads to a -long vaulted walkway that extends across the museum and is original to the 1928 building. The north entrance will be reopened to the public as a part of the &quot;core project&quot;, which is scheduled for completion in 2020. The core project also focuses on the interior of the current building and will add of public space, including of new gallery space for American art and contemporary art. In addition, a new space called the forum will be created, along with dining and retail spaces. Said Gehry: &quot;When it&#x27;s done, people coming to this museum will have an experience that&#x27;s as big as Bilbao. It won&#x27;t be apparent from the outside, but it will knock their socks off inside.&quot;

In March 2017, the museum announced a $525 million campaign. The core project is budgeted at $196 million and will be funded through the campaign. The museum also announced that more than 62 percent of the campaign goal has been met, as of March 30, 2017.

In March 2020, the museum was officially temporarily closed due to COVID-19 pandemic. All public events and programs were canceled until August 31, 2020. The museum reopened by late September 2020.

The most controversial part of the Gehry design remains a proposed window and amphitheater to be cut into the east entrance stairs. Others have criticized the design as too tame. The Gehry expansion is projected to be completed by 2028.

==Collections==

The Philadelphia Museum of Art houses more than 240,000 objects, highlighting the creative achievements of the Western world and those of Asia, in more than 200 galleries spanning 2,000 years. The museum&#x27;s collections of Egyptian and Roman art, and Pre-Columbian works, were relocated to the Penn Museum after an exchange agreement was made whereby the museum houses the university&#x27;s collection of Chinese porcelain.

Highlights of the Asian collections include paintings and sculpture from China, Japan, and India; furniture and decorative arts, including major collections of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ceramics; a large and distinguished group of Persian and Turkish carpets; and rare and authentic architectural assemblages such as a Chinese palace hall, a Japanese teahouse, and a 16th-century Indian temple hall.

The European collections, dating from the medieval era to the present, encompass Italian and Flemish early-Renaissance masterworks; strong representations of later European paintings, including French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism; sculpture, with a special concentration in the works of Auguste Rodin; decorative arts; tapestries; furniture; the second-largest collection of arms and armor in the United States; and period rooms and architectural settings ranging from the facade of a medieval church in Burgundy to a superbly decorated English drawing room by Robert Adam.

The museum&#x27;s American collections, surveying more than three centuries of painting, sculpture, and decorative arts, are among the finest in the United States, with outstanding strengths in 18th- and 19th-century Philadelphia furniture and silver, Pennsylvania German art, rural Pennsylvania furniture and ceramics, and the paintings of Thomas Eakins. The museum houses the most important Eakins collection in the world.

Modern artwork includes works by Pablo Picasso, Jean Metzinger, Antonio Rotta, Albert Gleizes, Marcel Duchamp, Salvador Dalí and Constantin Brâncuși, as well as American modernists. The expanding collection of contemporary art includes major works by Agnes Martin, Cy Twombly, Jasper Johns, and Sol LeWitt, among many others.

The museum houses encyclopedic holdings of costume and textiles, as well as prints, drawings, and photographs that are displayed in rotation for reasons of preservation.

===The Carl Otto Kretzschmar von Kienbusch Collection===

The museum also houses the armor collection of Carl Otto Kretzschmar von Kienbusch. The Von Kienbusch collection was bequeathed by the celebrated collector to the museum in 1976, the Anniversary of the American Revolution. The Von Kienbusch holdings are comprehensive and include European and Southwest Asian arms and armor spanning several centuries.

On May 30, 2000, the museum and the State Art Collections in Dresden, Germany (&quot;Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden&quot;), announced an agreement for the return of five pieces of armor stolen from Dresden during World War II. In 1953, Von Kienbusch had unsuspectingly purchased the armor, which was part of his 1976 bequest. Von Kienbusch published catalogs of his collection, which eventually led Dresden authorities to bring the matter up with the museum.

==Special exhibitions==
The Philadelphia Museum of Art organizes several special exhibitions each year. Special exhibitions have featured Salvador Dalí in 2005, Paul Cézanne in 2009, Auguste Renoir in 2010, Vincent van Gogh in 2012, Pablo Picasso in 2014, John James Audubon and Andy Warhol (et al.) in 2016, Winslow Homer and John Singer Sargent in 2017, and the Duchamp siblings—Marcel, Gaston, Raymond and Suzanne—in 2019. A Jasper Johns exhibition is planned for 2021.

In 2009, the museum organized &quot;Bruce Nauman: Topological Gardens&quot;, the official United States entry at the 53rd International Art Exhibition, more commonly known as the Venice Biennale, for which the artist Bruce Nauman was awarded the Golden Lion.

The same year, the museum announced that it would return an ancient &#x27;Pageant Shield&#x27; looted by Nazis to the Czech Republic.

==In popular culture==

Besides being known for its architecture and collections, the Philadelphia Museum of Art has in recent decades become known due to the role it played in the &quot;Rocky&quot; films&quot;Rocky&quot; (1976) and seven of its eight sequels, &quot;II&quot;, &quot;III&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;, &quot;Creed&quot;, &quot;Creed II&quot;, and &quot;Creed III&quot;. Visitors to the museum are often seen mimicking Rocky Balboa&#x27;s (portrayed by Sylvester Stallone) famous run up the east entrance stairs, informally nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Screen Junkies named the museum&#x27;s stairs the second most famous movie location behind only Grand Central Station in New York.

An tall bronze statue of the Rocky Balboa character was commissioned in 1980 and placed at the top of the stairs in 1982 for the filming of &quot;Rocky III&quot;. After filming was complete, Stallone donated the statue to the city of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Art Commission eventually decided to relocate the statue to the now-defunct Spectrum sports arena due to controversy over its prominent placement at the top of the museum&#x27;s front stairs and questions about its artistic merit. The statue was placed briefly on top of the stairs again for the 1990 film &quot;Rocky V&quot; and then returned to the Spectrum. In 2006, the statue was relocated to a new display area on the north side of the base of the stairs.

The museum provides the backdrop for concerts and parades because of its location at the end of the Ben Franklin Parkway. The museum&#x27;s east entrance area played host to the American venue of the international Live 8 concert held on July 2, 2005, with musical artists including Dave Matthews Band, Linkin Park and Maroon 5. The Philadelphia Freedom Concert, orchestrated and headlined by Elton John, was held two days later on the same outdoor stage from the Live 8 concert while a preceding ball was held inside the museum.

On September 26, 2015, the &quot;Festival of Families&quot; event, attended by Pope Francis, was held along the Ben Franklin Parkway with musical performances by various acts within Eakins Oval in front of the museum, as well as in Logan Square.

On April 27, 2017, the 2017 NFL draft was held at the museum through April 29 of that year.

On February 8, 2018, the victory parade for the Philadelphia Eagles&#x27; win in Super Bowl LII finished upon the museum steps, where players and team personnel gave speeches from a lectern to the large crowd gathered along Ben Franklin Parkway. On February 14, 2025, another victory parade finished on the museum steps to celebrate the Eagles victory in Super Bowl LIX. 

It was featured on the finale of The Amazing Race 36.

<doc id="404198" wikidata="Q4658646" url="?curid=404198" title="A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square">
<text>&quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; is a British romantic popular song written in 1939 and published in 1940, with lyrics by Eric Maschwitz and music by Manning Sherwin.

==Setting==

Berkeley Square is a large leafy square in Mayfair, a part of London. The Ritz Hotel referred to is just outside Mayfair, adjacent to Green Park.

That certain night, the night we met,
There was magic abroad in the air,
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square.
The nightingale, a migrant songbird, is celebrated in literature and music for the beauty of its song. It favours rural habitats, and is unlikely to be heard in Central London.

==Composition==
The song was written in the then-small French fishing village of Le Lavandou—now a favourite resort for British holidaymakers and second-home owners—shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. It is typically sung in the key of D-flat major by male vocalists such as Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra.

&quot;When the Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; is the title of a short story by Michael Arlen, published in 1923 as part of his collection &quot;These Charming People&quot;. According to Maschwitz, the title of the song was &quot;stolen&quot; from that of the story. The song had its first performance in the summer of 1939 in a local bar, where the melody was played on piano by Manning Sherwin with the help of the resident saxophonist. Maschwitz sang the words while holding a glass of wine, but nobody seemed impressed. In the spring of 2002, an attempt was made to find the bar where this song was first performed: it was hoped that a blue plaque could be set up. With the help of the local tourist office, elderly residents were questioned, but it proved impossible to identify the venue.

The verse and the additional lyrics to a second chorus were in the song as written, but are rarely sung in recordings (those of Bobby Darin, Mel Torme, Blossom Dearie, Twiggy, Vera Lynn and Rod Stewart being notable exceptions). Twiggy&#x27;s version was featured in an episode (&quot;Fran&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;) of &quot;The Nanny&quot;.

The song was published in 1940, when it was first performed in the London revue &quot;New Faces&quot; by Judy Campbell (later the mother of Jane Birkin). In the same year it was also performed by both Ray Noble and then by Vera Lynn. The tune is a recurring theme in the Fritz Lang film &quot;Man Hunt&quot; (1941). It was notably sung by Elsie Carlisle, an English female singer active both before and during the British dance band era.

==Recordings and performances==

Early chart hits of the song in the US were by Glenn Miller, Ray Noble, Guy Lombardo and Sammy Kaye. The Glenn Miller recording (Bluebird 10931) with a Ray Eberle vocal was made in New York City on 11 October 1940. The fluttering clarinet that opens the track and no doubt is meant to suggest the sound of the nightingale began, it seems, with the Miller recording. The opening, using either a clarinet or flute, has been picked up by others including the Frank Sinatra recording. The record was first charted on 21 December 1940, peaking at No. 2.

The song has since become a standard, being recorded by Bing Crosby (recorded 20 December 1940), Frank Sinatra in London in June 1962, and Rod Stewart on the 2004 album &quot;&quot;. It also appears on Vera Lynn&#x27;s album &quot;16 Most Requested Songs&quot;. Anita O&#x27;Day performed it on her 1956 album &quot;Anita&quot;, re-released in 1962 (V/V6-8483) as &quot;This is Anita&quot;; the song became part of the jazz singer&#x27;s repertoire. Nat King Cole sang it on the 1961 album &quot;The Touch of Your Lips&quot;, Carmen McRae, Perry Como on his 1977 &quot;The Best of British&quot; album, Stephane Grappelli, Bobby Darin on the 1962 album &quot;Oh! Look at Me Now&quot;, British comedian Richard Digance in 1979 on both single and LP, Harry Connick Jr. on the 1990 album &quot;We Are in Love&quot;, The Brian Setzer Orchestra on their eponymous 1994 album, and Sonny Rollins on the 2000 album &quot;This Is What I Do&quot;. The folk singer and accordionist John Kirkpatrick (musician) included the song on his album &quot;Three in a Row&quot; released in 1983. A version by The Manhattan Transfer won a Grammy Award for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices in 1982 for its arranger, Gene Puerling. A version was featured in an early Tom Hanks movie titled &quot;Everytime We Say Goodbye&quot; released in 1986. The British group the New Vaudeville Band wrote a highly distinctive version in 1966. The veteran British musician Ian Hunter, former vocalist for Mott the Hoople, regularly performs it in his concerts; and it has appeared on two at least of his live recordings. A performance of the song by British actor Robert Lindsay was used as the theme to the British situation comedy series &quot;Nightingales&quot;. Faryl Smith released a cover of the song on her debut album &quot;Faryl&quot; in 2009. The song was also sung in the episode &quot;Captain Jack Harkness&quot; on &quot;Torchwood&quot;. Lyrics from the song were also paraphrased in the 1990 novel &quot;Good Omens&quot; by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett (the story features an angel and a demon having lunch together at the Ritz, for example), and Tori Amos recorded the song for the 2019 television adaptation. The song is referenced again in season two when Crowley tells Aziraphale there are &quot;no nightingales&quot; during their fight and separation at the end of the season. The lyrics are spoken and sung by the actor John Le Mesurier on the album &quot;What Is Going to Become of Us All?&quot;

On 10 July 2005 there was a national celebration of the 60th anniversary of the ending of World War II when the song was sung live to millions by Petula Clark in central London to an audience of veterans and politicians as part of the programme &quot;V45 Britain At War: A Nation Remembers&quot;.

On 9 May 2015 Katherine Jenkins sang the song at VE Day 70: A Party to Remember at Horse Guards Parade in London. In 2015, British comedian and TV host Alexander Armstrong performed it on his first album, &quot;A Year of Songs&quot;. On a 2015 bonus episode of the podcast &quot;My Brother, My Brother and Me&quot; (&quot;The McElroy Family Fun Hour Brought to You by Totino&#x27;s&quot;), co-host Justin McElroy sang a parody entitled &quot;A Pizza Roll Sang in Berkeley Square.&quot;

Also in 2019, the song was performed in an episode of &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; by Darius de Haas.

The song features on Michael Bublé&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;Higher&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Franklin&#x27;s Tale&quot; () is one of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer. It focuses on issues of providence, truth, generosity and &quot;gentillesse&quot; in human relationships.

== Synopsis ==
A medieval franklin was free, non-serf yet did not have noble status, and this pilgrim&#x27;s words when interrupting the Squire are often seen as displaying his sense of an inferior social status.

The story opens and closes by recounting how two lovers, Arveragus and Dorigen, decide that their marriage should be one of equal partnership, although they agree that, in public, Arveragus should appear to have overall authority to preserve his high status. Arveragus then travels to Britain to seek honour and fame. He leaves Dorigen alone in France near the coastal town of Pedmark (today Penmarc&#x27;h) in Armorik (or Brittany as it is now known). She misses her husband terribly while he is gone, and is particularly concerned that his ship will be wrecked on the black rocks of Brittany as he returns home.
While Arveragus is absent, Dorigen is courted against her will by another suitor, a squire named Aurelius. Finally, to get rid of him and in a lighthearted mood, she makes a rash promise and tells Aurelius that he might have her love providing he can dispose of all the rocks on the coast of Brittany. Aurelius finally manages to secure the services of a magician-scholar of the arcane arts, who, taking pity on the young man, for the princely sum of a thousand pounds agrees &quot;thurgh his magik&quot; to make all the rocks &quot;aweye&quot; &quot;for a wyke or tweye&quot; (possibly by association with an exceptionally high tide).

When the &quot;rokkes&quot; vanish, Aurelius confronts Dorigen and demands that she fulfil her bargain. By this time Arveragus has returned safely. Dorigen lists numerous examples of legendary women who committed suicide to maintain their honour. Dorigen explains her moral predicament to her husband who calmly says that in good conscience she must go and keep her promise to Aurelius.

When Aurelius hears from a distraught Dorigen that Arveragus has told her to fulfil her promise, he releases Dorigen from her oath. The magician-scholar is so moved by Aurelius&#x27; story that he cancels the enormous debt that Aurelius owes him. The tale concludes with a demande d&#x27;amour, asking &#x27;which was the mooste fre?&#x27; (1622) - who acted most nobly, or generously?

== Background to the tale ==
 While the Franklin claims in his prologue that his story is in the form of a Breton lai, it is actually based on two closely related tales by the Italian poet and author Boccaccio. These appear in Book 4 of &quot;Il Filocolo&quot;, 1336, and as the 5th tale on the 10th day of the &quot;Decameron&quot;. In both stories, a young knight is in love with a lady married to another knight. He persuades her to promise to satisfy his desire if he can create a flowering Maytime garden in winter, which he achieves with the help of a magician, but releases her from her rash promise when he learns that her husband has nobly approved her keeping it. In Chaucer&#x27;s telling, the setting and style are radically altered. The relationship between the knight and his wife is explored, continuing the theme of marriage which runs through many of the pilgrims&#x27; tales. Although the Tale has a Breton setting, it differs from traditional &#x27;Breton lais&#x27;. Whereas these mostly involved the fairy supernatural, here magic is presented as a learned business performed by clerks with university training. 
This is fitting for a writer like Chaucer who wrote a book (for his son Lewis) on the use of the astrolabe, was reported by Holinshed to be &quot;a man so exquisitely learned in al sciences, that hys matche was not lightly founde anye where in those dayes&quot; and was even considered one of the &quot;secret masters&quot; of alchemy.

While the idea of the magical disappearance of rocks has a variety of potential sources, there is no direct source for the rest of the story. The rocks possibly come from the legends of Merlin performing a similar feat, or might stem from an actual event that happened around the time of Chaucer&#x27;s birth. In a recent paper, Olson et al. analyzed the Franklin&#x27;s Tale in terms of medieval astronomy. He noted that on 19 December 1340 the sun and moon were each at their closest possible distance to earth while simultaneously the sun, moon and earth were in a linear alignment; a rare configuration which causes massive high tides. This configuration could be predicted using the astronomical tables and the types of calculations cited in the tale. The theme of the story, though, is less obscure—that of the &quot;rash promise&quot;, in which an oath is made that the person does not envisage having to fulfil. The earliest examples of the &quot;rash promise&quot; motif are found in the Sanskrit stories of the Vetala as well as Bojardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Innamorto&quot; and Don Juan Manuel&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Count Lucanor&quot;. There are also rash promises in the Breton lays &#x27;Sir Orfeo&#x27; and &#x27;Sir Launfal&#x27;, which Chaucer may have known.

== Commentary ==
 Gerald Morgan argues that the Franklin&#x27;s Tale is organised around moral and philosophical ideas about the reality of Providence and hence of man&#x27;s moral freedom, as well as the need for generosity in all human contracts. Morgan considers that Aquinas&#x27; &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot; and Boethius&#x27; &quot;De Consolatione Philosophiae&quot; were important influences on Chaucer in writing the Franklin&#x27;s Tale. Hodgson likewise emphasises how in phraseology reminiscent of Boethius&#x27;s &quot;De Consolatione Philosophiae&quot;, Dorigen ponders why a wise and benevolent God could create in &quot;thise grisly feendly rokkes blake&quot; means to destroy and to produce no good &quot;but evere anoyen&quot;. D. W. Robertson considers that Arveragus comes across as &quot;not much of a husband&quot;; he exerts himself with many a labour and many a &quot;great emprise&quot; not for the sake of becoming virtuous, but to impress his lady and when he learns of her rash promise he advises her to go ahead and commit adultery, but only to keep quiet about it &quot;up peyne of deeth.&quot; This sour view of Arveragus is disputed by Bowden, who refers to Arveragus&#x27; honest belief that &quot;trouthe is the hyest thyng that man may kepe&quot; so that he too may be called &quot;a verray parfit gentil knyght&quot;. Gardner considers that the Franklin&#x27;s Tale comes close to Chaucer&#x27;s own philosophical position that all classes must be ruled by &quot;patience&quot;.

On the theme in the Canterbury Tales about freedom and sovereignty in marriage, the Franklin&#x27;s Tale arguably explores three successive acts of conscience or &quot;gentilesse&quot; springing from rich human generosity: by Dorigen&#x27;s husband, her suitor and the magician who cancels the debt owed to him. Howard, however, considers it unlikely that the Franklin&#x27;s Tale represents Chaucer&#x27;s view on marriage, the Franklin being &quot;not the sort of character to whom Chaucer would assign a tale meant to settle an issue&quot;. Helen Cooper writes that the absolutes considered in the tale are moral qualities (patience, &quot;fredom&quot; or generosity, &quot;gentillesse&quot;, &quot;trouthe&quot;): &quot;Averagus comforts his wife, and then bursts into tears. He and the other men make their choices for good without privileged knowledge and out of free will: a free will that reflects the liberty given to Dorigen within her marriage. A happy ending requires not that God should unmake the rocks, but that a series of individuals should opt to yield up and give, rather than take.&quot; Darragh Greene argues that the Franklin&#x27;s most distinctive characteristic, liberality, is essential to solving the ethical problem explored in his story; it is not law-based morality but the virtue ethics of living in accordance with the value system of &quot;gentillesse&quot; which secures such happiness as is possible in an imperfect world. Whittock considers that this tale represents, beyond the Franklin&#x27;s own consciousness of it, a &quot;fearful symmetry&quot; in the universe; where acting from conscience on qualities of truth, generosity and &quot;gentillesse&quot; must shift from being a secular ethical attitude to one that represents man&#x27;s grateful (but always imperfect) response to the bounty of a transcendent consciousness.
A. C. Spearing writes that one of the important messages of the &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Tale&quot; is that our vision of the right way to live, or how to do the right thing in problematic circumstances &quot;does not come to us directly from God or conscience, but is mediated by internalised images of ourselves as judged by other human beings. The very terms we use to assess conduct (right, decent, mean, rotten, and so on) belong to languages we did not invent for ourselves, and their meanings are given by the communities to which we belong.&quot;

<text>The November Uprising (1830–31), also known as the Polish–Russian War 1830–31 or the Cadet Revolution,
was an armed rebellion in the heartland of partitioned Poland against the Russian Empire. The uprising began on 29 November 1830 in Warsaw when young Polish officers from the military academy of the Army of Congress Poland revolted, led by Lieutenant Piotr Wysocki. Large segments of the peoples of Lithuania, Belarus, and Right-bank Ukraine soon joined the uprising. Although the insurgents achieved local successes, a numerically superior Imperial Russian Army under Ivan Paskevich eventually crushed the uprising.
The Russian Emperor Nicholas I issued the Organic Statute in 1832, according to which, henceforth Russian-occupied Poland would lose its autonomy and become an integral part of the Russian Empire. Warsaw became little more than a military garrison, and its university closed.

==Background==

After the Partitions of Poland by Austria, Germany, and Russia, Poland ceased to exist as an independent political entity at the end of 1795. However, the Napoleonic Wars and Polish participation in the wars against Russia and Austria resulted in the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. The Congress of Vienna brought that state&#x27;s existence to an end in 1815, and essentially solidified the long-term division of Poland between Russia, Prussia and Austria. The Austrian Empire annexed territories in the south, Prussia took control over the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Poznań in the west and Russia assumed hegemony over the semi-autonomous so-called Congress Kingdom.

Initially, the Russian-formed Congress Kingdom enjoyed a relatively large amount of internal autonomy and was only indirectly subject to imperial control. It had its own constitution. The province, united with Russia through a personal union with the Tsar as King of Poland, could elect its own parliament (the Sejm) and government. The kingdom had its own courts, army and treasury. Over time, the freedoms granted to the Kingdom were gradually taken back, and the constitution was progressively ignored by the Russian authorities. Alexander I of Russia never formally crowned himself as King of Poland. Instead, in 1815, he appointed his brother, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich as &quot;de facto&quot; viceroy and disregarded the constitution.

Soon after the Congress of Vienna resolutions had been signed, Russia ceased to respect them. In 1819, Alexander I abandoned liberty of the press in the Congress Kingdom and introduced censorship. The Russian secret police, commanded by Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev, started to infiltrate and persecute Polish clandestine organizations, and in 1821, the Tsar ordered the abolition of Freemasonry. As a result, after 1825, sessions of the Polish Sejm were conducted in secret. Nicholas I of Russia formally crowned himself as King of Poland on 24 May 1829 in Warsaw.

Despite numerous protests by various Polish politicians who actively supported the &quot;personal union&quot;, Grand Duke Constantine had no intention of respecting the Polish constitution, one of the most progressive in Europe at that time. He abolished Polish social and patriotic organizations and the liberal opposition of the Kaliszanie faction, and replaced Poles with Russians in important administrative positions. Although married to a Pole (Joanna Grudzińska), he was commonly considered an enemy of the Polish nation. Also, his command over the Polish Army led to serious conflicts within the officer corps. The frictions led to various conspiracies throughout the country, most notably within the army.

==Outbreak==
The armed struggle began when a group of conspirators led by a young cadet from the Warsaw officers&#x27; school, Piotr Wysocki, took arms from their garrison on 29 November 1830 and attacked the Belweder Palace, the main seat of the Grand Duke. The final spark that ignited Warsaw was a Russian plan to use the Polish Army to suppress France&#x27;s July Revolution and the Belgian Revolution, in clear violation of the Polish constitution.

The rebels managed to enter the Belweder, but Grand Duke Constantine had escaped in women&#x27;s clothing. The rebels then turned to the main city arsenal and captured it after a brief struggle. The following day, armed Polish civilians forced the Russian troops to withdraw north of Warsaw. That incident is sometimes called the &quot;Warsaw Uprising&quot; or the &quot;November Night&quot;. ().

==Uprising==

Taken by surprise with the rapidly unfolding of events during the night of 29 November 1830, the local Polish government (&quot;administrative council&quot;) assembled immediately to take control and to decide on a course of action. Unpopular ministers were removed and men like Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, the historian Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and General Józef Chłopicki took their places. Loyalists led by Prince Czartoryski initially tried to negotiate with Grand Duke Constantine and to settle matters peacefully. However, when Czartoryski told the council that Constantine was ready to forgive the offenders and that the matter would be amicably settled, Maurycy Mochnacki and other radicals angrily objected and demanded a national uprising. Fearing an immediate break with Russia, the government agreed to let Constantine depart with his troops.

Mochnacki did not trust the newly-constituted ministry and set out to replace it with the Patriotic Club, organized by him. At a large public demonstration on 3 December in Warsaw, he denounced the negotiations between the government and Grand Duke Constantine, who was encamped outside the city. Mochnacki advocated a military campaign in Lithuania to spare the country from the devastation of war and to preserve the local food supply. The meeting adopted a number of demands to be communicated to the administrative council, including the establishment of a revolutionary government and an immediate attack upon the forces of Constantine. The Polish army, with all but two of its generals, Wincenty Krasiński and Zygmunt Kurnatowski, now joined the uprising.

The remaining four ministers of the pre-revolutionary cabinet left the administrative council, and their places were taken by Mochnacki and three of his associates from the Patriotic Club, including Joachim Lelewel. The new body was known as the &quot;provisional government&quot;. To legalize its actions the provisional government ordered the convocation of the Sejm and on 5 December 1830 proclaimed General Chłopicki as &quot;dictator of the uprising&quot;.

Chłopicki considered the uprising an act of madness but bowed to pressure and consented to take command temporarily in the hope that it would be unnecessary to take the field. An able and highly-decorated soldier, he had retired from the army because of the chicanery of Constantine. He overestimated the power of Russia and underestimated the strength and the fervor of the Polish revolutionary movement. By temperament and conviction, he was opposed to a war with Russia and did not believe in a successful outcome. He accepted the dictatorship essentially to maintain internal peace and to save the constitution.

Believing that Tsar Nicholas was unaware of his brother&#x27;s actions and that the uprising could be ended if the Russian authorities accepted the constitution, Chłopicki&#x27;s first move was to send Prince Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki to Saint Petersburg to negotiate. Chłopicki refrained from strengthening the Polish army and refused to initiate armed hostilities by expelling Russian forces from Lithuania. However, the radicals in Warsaw pressed for war and the complete liberation of Poland. On 13 December, the Sejm pronounced the &quot;National Uprising&quot; against Russia, and on 7 January 1831, Prince Drucki-Lubecki returned from Russia with no concessions. The Tsar demanded the complete and unconditional surrender of Poland and announced that the &quot;Poles should surrender to the grace of their Emperor&quot;. His plans foiled, Chłopicki resigned the following day.

Power in Poland was now in the hands of the radicals united in the &quot;Towarzystwo Patriotyczne&quot; (&#x27;Patriotic Society&#x27;), directed by Joachim Lelewel. On 25 January 1831, the Sejm passed the Act of Dethronization of Nicholas I, which ended the Polish-Russian personal union and was equivalent to a declaration of war on Russia. The proclamation declared that &quot;the Polish nation is an independent people and has a right to offer the Polish crown to him whom it may consider worthy, from whom it might with certainty expect faith to his oath and wholehearted respect to the sworn guarantees of civic freedom.&quot;

On 29 January, the national government of Adam Jerzy Czartoryski was established, and Michał Gedeon Radziwiłł was chosen as successor to Chłopicki, who was persuaded to accept active command of the army.

== Russo-Polish War ==
It was too late to move the theatre of hostilities to Lithuania. On 4 February 1831, a 115,000-strong Russian army under Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch crossed the Polish borders. The force included the Finnish Guards&#x27; Rifle Battalion. The first major battle took place on 14 February 1831, close to the village of Stoczek near Łuków. In the Battle of Stoczek, Polish cavalry under Brigadier Józef Dwernicki defeated the Russian division of Teodor Geismar. However, the victory had mostly psychological value and could not stop the Russian advance towards Warsaw. The subsequent Battles of Dobre, Wawer and Białołęka were inconclusive.

The Polish forces then assembled on the right bank of the Vistula to defend the capital. On 25 February, a Polish contingent of approximately 40,000 met a Russian force of 60,000 east of Warsaw at the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska. Both armies withdrew after almost two days of heavy fighting and with considerable losses on both sides. Over 7,000 Poles fell on that field, and the number of killed in the Russian army was slightly larger. Diebitsch was forced to retreat to Siedlce and Warsaw was saved.
Chłopicki, whose soldierly qualities reasserted themselves by military activity, was wounded in action and his place taken by General Jan Skrzynecki, who, like his predecessor, had won distinction under Napoleon for personal courage. Disliked by Grand Duke Constantine, he had retired from service. He shared with Chłopicki the conviction that war with Russia was futile but with the opening of hostilities took command of a corps and fought creditably at Grochov. When the weak and indecisive Michał Radziwiłł surrendered the dictatorship, Skrzynecki was chosen to succeed him. He endeavored to end the war by negotiations with the Russian field commanders and hoped for benign foreign intervention.

Sympathetic echoes of the Polish aspirations reverberated throughout Europe. Enthusiastic meetings had been held in Paris under Lafayette&#x27;s chairmanship, and money for the Polish cause was collected in the United States. The governments of France and Britain, however, did not share the feelings of some of their people. King Louis-Philippe of France thought mainly of securing for himself recognition on the part of all European governments, and Lord Palmerston was intent on maintaining friendly relations with Russia.

Britain regarded with alarm the reawakening of the French national spirit and did not wish to weaken Russia, &quot;as Europe might soon again require her services in the cause of order, and to prevent Poland, whom it regarded as a national ally of France, from becoming a French province of the Vistula&quot;. Austria and Prussia adopted a position of benevolent neutrality towards Russia. They closed the Polish frontiers and prevented the transportation of munitions of war or supplies of any kind.

Under those circumstances, the war with Russia began to take on a somber and disquieting aspect. The Poles fought desperately and attempts were made to rouse Volhynia, Podolia, Samogitia and Lithuania. With the exception of the Lithuanian uprising in which the youthful Countess Emilia Plater and several other women distinguished themselves, the guerilla warfare carried on in the frontier provinces was of minor importance and served only to give Russia an opportunity to crush local risings. Notorious was the slaughter of the inhabitants of the small town of Ashmiany in Belarus. Meanwhile, new Russian forces under Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia arrived in Poland but met with many defeats. Constant warfare, however, and bloody battles such as that at Ostroleka in which 8,000 Poles died, considerably depleted the Polish forces. Mistakes on the part of the commanders, constant changes and numerous resignations, and the inactivity of the commanders, who continued to hope for foreign intervention, added to the feeling of despair.

The more radical elements severely criticized the government not only for its inactivity but also for its lack of land reform and its failure to recognize the peasants&#x27; rights to the soil they tilled, but the Sejm, fearing that the governments of Europe might regard the war with Russia as social revolution, procrastinated and haggled over concessions. The initial enthusiasm of the peasantry waned, and the ineptitude of the government became more apparent.

In the meantime, the Russian forces, commanded after the death of Diebitsch by General Paskevich, were moving to encircle Warsaw. Skrzynecki failed to prevent the Russian forces from joining, and the Sejm responded to popular clamor for his deposition by appointing General Dembinski to temporary command. The atmosphere was highly charged. Severe rioting took place and the government became completely disorganized. Count Jan Krukowiecki was made President of the Ruling Council. He had little faith in the success of the military campaign but believed that when passions had subsided he could end the war on what seemed to him advantageous terms.

Despite a desperate defence by General Józef Sowiński, Warsaw&#x27;s suburb of Wola fell to Paskevich&#x27;s forces on 6 September. The next day saw the second line of the capital&#x27;s defensive works attacked by the Russians. During the night of 7 September Krukowiecki capitulated, although the city still held out. He was immediately deposed by the Polish government and replaced by Bonawentura Niemojowski. The army and the government withdrew to the Modlin fortress, on the Vistula, subsequently renamed Novo-Georgievsk by the Russians, and then to Płock. New plans had been adopted when the news arrived that the Polish crack corps under Ramorino, unable to join the main army, had laid down its arms after crossing the Austrian frontier into Galicia. It became evident that the war could be carried on no longer.

On 5 October 1831, the remainder of the Polish army of over 20,000 men crossed the Prussian frontier and laid down their arms at Brodnica in preference to submission to Russia. Only one man, a colonel by the name of Stryjenski, gained the peculiar distinction of giving himself up to Russia.

Following the example of Dąbrowski a generation before, General Bem endeavored to reorganize the Polish soldiers in Prussia and Galicia into Legions and lead them to France, but the Prussian government frustrated his plans. The immigrants left Prussia in bands of between fifty and a hundred, and their journey through the various German principalities was greeted with enthusiasm by the local populations. Even German sovereigns such as the King of Saxony, the Princess of Weimar and the Duke of Gotha shared in the general demonstration of sympathy. It was only upon the very insistent demands of Russia that the Polish committees all over Germany were be closed.

== Aftermath ==


Adam Czartoryski remarked that the war with Russia, precipitated by the rising of young patriots in November 1830, came either too early or too late. Puzyrewski argued that the rising should have been initiated in 1828, when Russia was experiencing reversals in Turkey and was least able to spare substantial forces for war with Poland (Lewinski-Corwin, 1917). Military critics, such as the Russian pundit General Puzyrevsky, maintained that in spite of the inequality of resources of the two countries, Poland had had every chance of holding her own against Russia if the campaign had been managed skillfully.

Russia sent over 180,000 well-trained men against Poland&#x27;s 70,000, 30% of whom were fresh recruits entering the service at the opening of hostilities. &quot;In view of this, one would think that not only was the result of the struggle undoubted, but its course should have been a triumphant march for the infinitely stronger party. Instead, the war lasted eight months, with often doubtful success. At times the balance seemed to tip decidedly to the side of the weaker adversary who dealt not only blows but even ventured daring offensives.&quot;

It had long been argued, as Edward Lewinski-Corwin in 1917, that &quot;anarchy and a lack of concord&quot; among people were the causes of Poland&#x27;s national downfall. Thus, when the rising finally began, the insurgents demanded absolute power for their leaders and tolerated no criticism for fear that discord would again prove ruinous for all. However, the men chosen to lead, because of their past achievements, proved unable to perform the great task expected of them. Moreover, many apparently had little faith that their joint effort could succeed.

Militarily, Poland might have succeeded if the line of battle had been established in Lithuania, wrote Lewinski-Corwin, and if the Russian forces, arriving in Poland progressively, had been dealt with separately and decisively, one unit after another.

After the end of the November Uprising, Polish women wore black ribands and jewellery as a symbol of mourning for their lost homeland. Such images can be seen in the first scenes of the movie &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot;, filmed by Andrzej Wajda in 1999, based on the Polish national epic. A 1937 German film, &quot;Ride to Freedom&quot; was partly shot on location in Poland.

The Scottish poet Thomas Campbell, who had championed the cause of the Poles in &quot;The Pleasures of Hope&quot;, was affected by the news of the capture of Warsaw by the Russians in 1831 as if it had been the deepest of personal calamities. &quot;Poland preys on my heart night and day&quot;, he wrote in one of his letters, and his sympathy found a practical expression in the foundation in London of the Association of the Friends of Poland. The November Uprising was also supported in the United States. Edgar Allan Poe was sympathetic to the Polish cause and volunteered to fight the Russians during the November Uprising (Bobr-Tylingo 1982, 145).

Despite Poland&#x27;s deep connection to Catholicism and the fact that many participants in the rebellion were Catholic, the rebellion was condemned by the Church. Pope Gregory XVI issued an encyclical letter in the following year on the subject of civil disobedience. &quot;Cum Primum&quot; stated:

 When the first report of the calamities, which so seriously devastated your flourishing kingdom reached our ears, We learned simultaneously that they had been caused by some fabricators of deceit and lies. Under the pretext of religion, and revolting against the legitimate authority of the princes, they filled their fatherland, which they loosed from due obedience to authority, with mourning. We shed abundant tears at the feet of God, grieving over the harsh evil with which some of our flock was afflicted. Afterward We humbly prayed that God would enable your provinces, agitated by so many and so serious dissensions, to be restored to peace and to the rule of legitimate authority.

== In popular culture ==
Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy in F minor Op. 49&quot; was completed and published in 1841, and many performers regard this work as an “Ode to the Fallen,” in which Chopin is reminiscing about family and friends killed or missing as a result of the 1831 rebellion.

Aleksander Chodźko composed the song &quot;Herby&quot; about this uprising. The remix created by Dawid Hallmann gained popularity.

<text>The Silesian Uprisings (; ) were a series of three uprisings from August 1919 to July 1921 in Upper Silesia, which was part of the Weimar Republic at the time. Ethnic Polish and Polish-Silesian insurrectionists, seeking to have the area transferred to the newly founded Polish Republic, fought German police and paramilitary forces which sought to keep the area part of the new German state founded after World War I. Following the conflict, the area was divided between the two countries. The rebellions have subsequently been commemorated in modern Poland as an example of Polish nationalism. Despite central government involvement in the conflict, Polish historiography renders the events as uprisings reflecting the will of ordinary Upper Silesians rather than a war.
In total, several thousand people may have died violently in the militant clashes in Upper Silesia between 1919 and 1922. About four fifths of the victims were killed during the three Silesian uprisings, three fifths alone during the Third Silesian uprising in 1922.

==Background==

Much of Silesia had belonged to the Crown of Polish Kingdom in medieval times, but it passed to the Kings of Bohemia under the Holy Roman Empire in the 14th century. Following the death of Louis II Jagiellon of Bohemia and Hungary in the Battle of Mohács, Silesia became part of the Habsburg monarchy when Ferdinand I of Austria was elected as the King of Bohemia. Frederick the Great of Prussia seized Silesia from Maria Theresa of Austria in 1742 in the War of Austrian Succession, after which it became a part of Prussia and subsequently, in 1871, the German Empire. Although the province of Silesia overall had by then become Germanized through the Ostsiedlung and later the Kulturkampf, Poles constituted a majority in Upper Silesia.

===Mineral resources===
Upper Silesia was bountiful in mineral resources and heavy industry, with mines, iron and steel mills. The Silesian mines were responsible for almost a quarter of Germany&#x27;s annual output of coal, of its zinc and 34 percent of its lead.
After World War I, during the negotiations of the Treaty of Versailles, the German government claimed that, without Upper Silesia, it would not be able to fulfill its obligations with regard to reparations to the Allies.

===Demographics in the early 20th century===
The area in Upper Silesia east of the Oder was dominated by ethnic Poles, most of whom were working class. Most spoke a dialect of Polish, a few felt they were a Slavic group of their own called Silesians. In contrast, most of the local middle and upper classes were ethnic Germans, including the landowners, businessmen, factory owners, local government, police, and Catholic clergy. The population of Upper Silesia was overwhelmingly Catholic with 92% of the people being Roman Catholic. Most of the 8% of Upper Silesians who were Protestant tended to be Germans, but the linguistic and ethnic divide between Catholic Germans and Poles tended to subsume their shared religion.

In the German census of 1900, 65% of the population of the eastern part of Silesia was recorded as Polish-speaking, which decreased to 57% in 1910. This was partly a result of forced Germanization, but was also due to the creation of a &quot;bilingual&quot; category, which reduced the number of Polish speakers. American Paul Weber drew up a language map that showed that in 1910, in most of the Upper Silesian districts east of the Oder river, Polish-speaking Silesians constituted a majority, forming more than 70% of the population there.

While still under German control, various Poles identified as Silesians would write, publish, distribute pamphlets, newsletters and other written material, promoting the idea of a Polish-Silesian Identity. Included among the statements within these texts was adherence to the Roman Catholic church. One such publisher was Ignacy Bulla (later changed to Buła in celebration), who would spread information related to these principles at risk to his own life and freedom. He is widely credited with having inspired the Polish-Silesian patriotic feelings that inspired the uprisings. His contribution to bringing Silesia back into the Roman Catholic Church was the subject of at least one dissertation presented by a Seminary student.
===The First World War===
As a frontier area, Upper Silesia was placed under martial law in August 1914 and remained so for rest of the war. The German military administrators distrusted the Poles, taking the viewpoint that as Slavs, they were naturally sympathetic towards the Russians, and governed Upper Silesia in a very high-handed and harsh manner. The First World War was a period in Upper Silesia of collapsing living standards as wages failed to keep up with inflation; almost everyone suffered from shortages of food and working hours were increased in the mines and factories. The nationalist climate produced by the Spirit of 1914, with its sense that all Germans should rally behind the Kaiser in the war effort, led members of Germany&#x27;s Polish minority to feel more excluded and marginalized than before 1914. The subject of an independent Polish state was first raised by the Germans and Austrians who in 1916 created a puppet Polish state on the territory of Congress Poland, the lands of which were taken from the Russian Empire in 1915. The way in which the Allies promoted the promise of an independent Poland after the war, most notably in the 14 Points issued by the American president Woodrow Wilson led to hopes within the Polish community within the &quot;Reich&quot; that Poland might be reborn again after an Allied victory. During the First World War, about 56,000 men from Upper Silesia were killed fighting in the war with the heaviest losses being taken at the Battle of Somme in 1916.

===Versailles plebiscite===

During the Paris peace conference in 1919, a strong division emerged between the British prime minister David Lloyd George who wanted Upper Silesia to remain within Germany vs. the French Premier Georges Clemenceau who supported the Polish claim to Upper Silesia. The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, had ordered a plebiscite in Upper Silesia, to determine whether the territory should be a part of Germany or Poland. The plebiscite was to be held within two years of the Treaty in the whole of Upper Silesia, although the Polish government had only requested it to be held in the areas east of the Oder river, which had a significant number of Polish speakers. Thus, the plebiscite took place in all of Upper Silesia, including the predominantly areas in the east and the predominantly German-speaking areas west of the river. The Upper Silesian plebiscite was to be conducted on 20 March 1921. In the meantime, the German administration and police remained in place. The requirement for a referendum in Upper Silesia in the Treaty of Versailles was a compromise to resolve the Anglo-French dispute at the Paris peace conference. Around the German city of Posen turned the Polish city of Poznań, an uprising by the Polish majority in December 1918 had left about 2,900 people dead, and it was felt preferable to have a plebiscite in Upper Silesia and rather a resort to arms as being the case in Poznań. 

Meanwhile, propaganda and strong arm tactics by both sides led to increasing unrest. The German authorities warned that those voting for Poland might forfeit their jobs and pensions. Pro-Polish activists argued that, under Polish rule, Silesian Poles would no longer be discriminated against. Poland also promised to honour their German state social benefits, such as the old age pensions. However, many German Army veterans joined the Freikorps (Free Corps), a paramilitary organization whose troops fought any pro-Polish activists. The pro-Poland side employed the Polish Military Organisation (&quot;POW&quot;) – a secret military organisation and predecessor of Polish intelligence – to fight back with the same force.

The majority of the men serving in the para-military forces on both sides were veterans of the First World War and were experienced soldiers, accustomed to fighting and killing. In addition, most of the men serving on the German side had served in the &quot;Freikorps&quot; (&quot;Free Corps&quot;), units of volunteers raised by the government to fight against the possibility of a Communist revolution. Most of the men serving on the Polish side had previously served in the German military during World War One. 

Eventually, the deteriorating situation resulted in Upper Silesian Uprisings conducted by Poles in 1919 and 1920.

The right to vote was granted to all aged 20 and older who either had been born in or lived in the plebiscite area. A result was the mass migration of both Germans and Poles. The German newcomers accounted for 179,910, while Polish newcomers numbered over 10,000. Without these &quot;new voters&quot;, the pro-German vote would have had a majority of 58,336 instead of the final 228,246. The plebiscite took place as arranged on 20 March. A total of 707,605 votes were cast for Germany and 479,359 for Poland.

The Third Silesian Uprising conducted by Poles broke out in 1921 supported by thousands of troops from outside the region mobilized by the Polish government.. The League of Nations was asked to settle the dispute before it led to even more bloodshed. In 1922, a six-week debate decided that Upper Silesia should be divided. This was accepted by both countries, and the majority of Upper Silesians. Approximately 736,000 Poles and 260,000 Germans thus found themselves now in Polish (Upper) Silesia, and 532,000 Poles and 637,000 Germans remained in German (Upper) Silesia.
== Uprisings ==

===First Uprising (1919)===
On 15 August 1919, German border guards (&quot;Grenzschutz&quot;) massacred ten Silesian civilians in a labour dispute at the Mysłowice mine (&quot;Myslowitzer Grube&quot;). The massacre sparked protests from the Silesian Polish miners, including a general strike of about 140,000 workers, and caused the First Silesian uprising against German control of Upper Silesia. The miners demanded the local government and police become ethnically mixed to include both Germans and Poles.

About 21,000 German soldiers of the Weimar Republic&#x27;s Provisional National Army (&quot;Vorläufige Reichsheer&quot;), with about 40,000 troops held in reserve, quickly put down the uprising. The army&#x27;s reaction was harsh, with 2,500 Poles either hanged or executed by firing squad for their parts in the protest. Some 9,000 ethnic Poles sought refuge in the Second Polish Republic, taking along their family members. This came to an end when Allied forces were brought in to restore order, and the refugees were allowed to return later that year.
===Second Uprising (1920)===
The Second Silesian Uprising () was the second of the three uprisings.

In February 1920, an Allied Plebiscite Commission was sent to Upper Silesia. It was composed of representatives of the Allied forces, mostly from France, with smaller contingents from United Kingdom and Italy. Soon, however, it became apparent that the Allied forces were too few to maintain order. Further, the commission was torn apart by lack of consensus: the British and Italians favored the Germans, while the French supported the Poles. The British blamed this situation on France&#x27;s intent on limiting Germany&#x27;s industrial might. Those forces failed to prevent continuing unrest.

In August 1920, a German newspaper in Upper Silesia printed what later turned out to be a false announcement of the fall of Warsaw to the Red Army in the Polish–Soviet War. Pro-German activists spontaneously organised a march to celebrate what they assumed would be the end of independent Poland. The volatile situation quickly degenerated into violence as pro-German demonstrators began looting Polish shops; the violence continued even after it had become clear that Warsaw had not fallen.

On 19 August, the violence eventually led to a Polish uprising which quickly resulted within the occupation of government offices in the districts of Kattowitz (Katowice), Pless (Pszczyna) and Beuthen (Bytom). Between 20 and 25 August, the rebellion spread to Königshütte (Chorzów), Tarnowitz (Tarnowskie Góry), Rybnik, Lublinitz (Lubliniec) and Gross Strehlitz (Strzelce Opolskie). The Allied Commission declared its intention to restore order, but internal differences kept anything from being done; British representatives held the French responsible for the easy spread of the uprising through the eastern region.

The fighting was slowly brought to an end in September, by a combination of allied military operations and negotiations between the parties. The Poles obtained the disbanding of the &quot;Sipo&quot; police and the creation of a new police (&quot;Abstimmungspolizei&quot;) for the area, which would be 50% Polish. Poles were also admitted to the local administration. The Polish Military Organisation in Upper Silesia was supposed to be disbanded, though in practice this did not happen.
===Third Uprising (1921)===


The Third Silesian Uprising () was the last, largest and longest of the three uprisings. It included the Battle of Annaberg and began in the aftermath of a plebiscite that yielded mixed results. The British and French governments could not reach a consensus on the interpretation of the plebiscite. The primary problem was the disposition of the &quot;Industrial Triangle&quot; east of the Oder river, whose triangle ends were marked by the cities of Beuthen (Bytom), Gleiwitz (Gliwice) and Kattowitz (Katowice). The French wanted to weaken Germany, and thus supported Polish claims on the territory; the British and the Italians disagreed, in part because the German government declared that a loss of the Silesian industries would render Germany incapable of paying the demanded war reparations. Devising a frontier that was mutually acceptable to both sides proved to be impossible because in many of the contested districts of Upper Silesia, the people in the urban areas tended to vote for staying in Germany while the rural areas voted for going to Poland. Thus, any division would mean that a number of people would end up on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the frontier.

In late April 1921, rumours spread that the British position would prevail, prompting the local Polish activists to organise an uprising. The insurrection was to begin in early in May. Having learned from previous failures, the Third War was carefully planned and organized under the leadership of Wojciech Korfanty. It started on 2–3 May 1921, with the destruction of German rail bridges (see &quot;Wawelberg Group&quot;) in order to slow down the movement of German reinforcements. A particular concern was to prevent the recurrence of violent acts against Polish civilians by members of the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, demobilised Imperial German army units that had refused to disband. These paramilitary units existed throughout Germany and usually acted independently from both the provisional official army and the leadership of the fledgling German Republic. However, the &quot;Reich&quot; government subsidized these groups and thus had much leverage over them. The most violent and the most aggressive of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; units sent into Upper Silesia was the Oberland corps from Bavaria, which seemed to have been the unit most responsible for the atrocities on the German side. 

The Inter-Allied Commission, in which General Henri Le Rond was the most influential individual, waited rather long prior to taking any steps to end the violence. The French troops generally favored the insurrection, while within some cases, British and Italian contingents actively cooperated with Germans. UK Prime Minister Lloyd George&#x27;s speech in the British Parliament, strongly disapproving of the insurrection, aroused the hopes of some Germans, but the &quot;Entente&quot; appeared to have no troops ready and available for dispatch. The only action the &#x27;Inter-Allied Military Control Commission&#x27; and the French government made was demanding immediate prohibition of the recruiting of German volunteers from outside Upper Silesia, and this was promptly made public.

After the initial success of the insurgents in taking over a large portion of Upper Silesia, the German &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; several times resisted the attacks of Wojciech Korfanty&#x27;s Polish troops, in some cases with the cooperation of British and Italian troops. An attempt on the part of the British troops to take steps against the Polish forces was prevented by General Jules Gratier, the French commander-in-chief of the Allied troops. Eventually, the insurgents kept most of territory they had won, including the local industrial district. They proved that they could mobilize large amounts of local support, while the German forces based outside Silesia were barred from taking an active part in the conflict.

The fighting in Upper Silesia was characterized by numerous atrocities on both sides with rape and mutilation being integral and routine methods of war. The men of both sides tended to conflate &quot;national honor&quot; and their sense of masculinity with their perceived ability to &quot;protect&quot; the women of their respective communities from the other side. For both sides, rape served as a way to symbolically &quot;unman&quot; the men of the other side by proving that they were incapable of defending their women and as a way of asserting their power over the women of the other side, hence the frequency of rape. Complaints about rape by both sides started to become common after the 1919 uprising, but were most common after the 1921 uprising. The British historian Tim Wilson wrote about sexual violence by the German forces: &quot;Eighteen such incidents can be easily verified. Many of these were multiple rapes; in other cases of mass rape the number of victims were not even given&quot;. In September 1922, the Polish government submitted a detailed dossier about the rape of Polish Upper Silesian women to the League of Nations. Wilson also wrote that rape of women believed to be supporting the German cause by &quot;Polish militants&quot; was &quot;relatively common&quot;.

Mutilation by both sides were a common tactic as a way to show dominance over the other side. Both sides liked to mutilate the faces of their victims to the point of obliviating the face as a way to show their dominance by robbing the victim of not only their lives, but even their identities that they held in life. Reports from the British officers state that the &quot;corpses of both men and women have been mutilated&quot;. The most common means of mutilation was by smashing in the face with rifle butts into a bloody mash. Likewise, castration of prisoners were a common tactic, again as a way to show dominance and to literally &quot;unman&quot; the other side. Violence against the genitals was the second common form of mutilation of faces. One British Army officer wrote in 1921 &quot;It is revolting the number of murders that took place, generally at night and in the woods, which no amount of patrolling could stop. For instance, a one-armed German ex-soldier was taken out and murdered by the Poles one night, and the same night the French reported several murders by the Germans near their post in the woods close by&quot;. Wilson wrote that these tactics were not &quot;the triumph of innate barbarism in the absence of social constraint&quot;, but rather were tactics quite consciously chosen to express contempt and dominance. Much of the grotesque violence was due to the fluidity of identities in Upper Silesia where many people saw themselves as neither German nor Polish, but rather Silesian, thus leading to nationalists to take extreme measures to polarize society into diametrically opposed blocs. In May-June 1921, at least 1,760 people were killed in the fighting in Upper Silesia. 

The support of France for Poland proved to be crucial. On 23 May 1921, the &quot;Freikorps&quot; defeated the Poles at the Battle of Annaberg, which in turn led to a French ultimatum demanding that the &quot;Reich&quot; cease at once its support of the German para-military forces. The next day, much to the shock of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; who were expecting to follow up their victory by keeping all of Upper Silesia for Germany, the German president Frederich Ebert bowed to the ultimatum and banned the &quot;Freikorps&quot;. 

Twelve days after the outbreak of the insurrection, Korfanty offered to take his troops behind a line of demarcation (the &quot;Korfanty Line&quot;), conditional on the released territory not being re-occupied by German forces, but by Allied troops. It was not, however, until 1 July that the British troops arrived in Upper Silesia and began to advance in company with those of the other Allies towards the former frontier. Simultaneously, with this advance, the Inter-Allied Commission pronounced a general amnesty for the illegal actions committed during the insurrection, with the exception of acts of revenge and cruelty. The German &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; was withdrawn and disbanded.

==Aftermath==
Arrangements between the Germans and Poles in Upper Silesia and appeals issued by both sides, as well as the dispatch of six battalions of Allied troops and the disbandment of the local guards, contributed markedly to the pacification of the district.

The Allied Supreme Council was, however, still unable to come to an agreement on the partition of the Upper Silesian territory on the lines of the plebiscite; the British and the French could only agree on one solution: turning the question over to the Council of the League of Nations.

The greatest excitement was caused all over Germany and in the German part of Upper Silesia by the intimation that the Council of the League of Nations had handed over the matter for closer investigation to a commission; this remained composed of four representatives, one each from Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and China. The commission collected its own data and issued a decision, stressing the principle of self-determination. On the basis of the reports of this commission and those of its experts, in October 1921 the Council awarded the greater part of the Upper Silesian industrial district to Poland.

The Polish Government had decided to give Silesia considerable autonomy with the Silesian Parliament as a constituency and the Silesian Voivodeship Council as the executive body.

Poland obtained almost exactly half of the 1,950,000 inhabitants, &quot;viz.&quot;, 965,000, but not quite a third of the territory, i.e., only 3,214 of 10,951 square kilometres (1,241 of 4,228 mi2). This, however, constituted the more valuable portion by far of the district. Of 61 coal mines 49 fell to Poland, the Prussian state losing 3 mines out of 4. Of a coal output of 31,750,000 tonnes, 24,600,000 tonnes fell to Poland. All iron mines with an output of 61,000 tonnes fell to Poland. Of 37 furnaces, 22 went to Poland, 15 to Germany. Of a pig-iron output of 570,000 tonnes, 170,000 tonnes remained German, and 400,000 tonnes became Polish. Of 16 zinc and lead mines, which produced 233,000 tons in 1920, only 4, with an output of 44,000 tonnes, remained German. The main towns of Königshütte (Chorzów), Kattowitz (Katowice), and Tarnowitz (Tarnowskie Góry) were given to Poland. In the Silesian territory that Poland regained, the Germans were a significant minority. Similarly, a significant minority of Poles (about half a million Poles) was still left on the German side, most of them in Oppeln (Opole).

In order to mitigate the hardships likely to arise from the partition of a district that was essentially an economic unit, it was decided, on the recommendation of the Council of the League of Nations, that German and Polish delegates, under a chairman appointed by the Council of the League, should draw up economic regulations as well as a statute for the protection of minorities, which were to have a duration of fifteen years. Special measures were threatened in the event that either of the two states should refuse to participate in the drawing up of such regulations, or to accept them subsequently.

In May 1922, the League of Nations issued the German-Polish Accord on East Silesia, also known as the &quot;Geneva Accord&quot;, intended to preserve the economic unity of the area and to guarantee minority rights. The League also set up a tribunal to arbitrate disputes. Furthermore, in response to a German complaint about the importance of Silesian coal for the German industry, Germany was given the right to import 500,000 tons per year at discounted prices. In 1925, three years following the development of the agreement and approaching the termination of the coal agreement, Germany refused to import the appropriate quantities of coal, attempting to use the coal issue as a lever against Poland, trying to impose a revision of the whole Polish-German frontier. Polish-German relations worsened, as Germany also began a tariff war with Poland, but the Polish government would not yield on the border issue.

In 1921, Adolf Hitler who was the best known member of the Munich-based National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party, but not its leader, came into conflict with the party&#x27;s founder and leader, Anton Drexler. In July 1921, the dispute came was resolved with Hitler seizing control of the party and deposing Drexler as a party leader. At the meeting in Munich that decided in favor of Hitler, it was the veterans of the Upper Silesia campaign newly returned to Bavaria, described by one contemporary as the &quot;Upper Silesian adventurers, flashing medals, badges and swastikas&quot;, who provided the decisive votes which enabled the triumph of Hitler over Drexler. A number of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; veterans of the Upper Silesia war such as Fritz Schmedes went on to serve in the Nazi Party. Schmedes, who played a leading role as a &quot;Freikorps&quot; officer in the &quot;vicious fighting&quot; in Upper Silesia in 1921, became a SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; in World War Two who committed one of the worse massacres ever in Greek history when his men massacred the entire village of Distomo on 10 June 1944. 

Under the Sanation regime, Michał Grażyński, was appointed as the voivode of Polish Upper Silesia in 1926. Grażyński was involved in a lengthy feud with Korfanty and went out of his way to downplay and minimize Korfanty&#x27;s role in the uprisings. By contrast, Grażyński vastly inflated his own role in the third uprising, as he was only the chief of staff of one of the uprising&#x27;s army groups. During his time in office, which lasted until 1939, Grażyński held rallies to honor the anniversary of the uprising of 1921 every May 3rd, as his regime was based on the support of Związek Powstańców Śląskich. Grażyński&#x27;s rallies were largely boycotted by Korfanty and his supporters. 

In September 1939, Polish Upper Silesia was annexed to Germany, and during the German occupation, there were a violent policy of Germanizing the &quot;recovered lands&quot;. During the German occupation, Polish veterans of the Upper Silesia uprisings were hunted down and killed as enemies of the &quot;Reich&quot;. For this reason alone, the Polish veterans tended to be overrepresented in the Polish resistance. In 1945, all of Upper Silesia was annexed to Poland. During the Communist era, the government in Warsaw took an ultra-nationalist line to rebut the charge that it was under Soviet domination, and placed great emphasis on the &quot;recovered western territories&quot; as the centerpiece of its claim for legitimacy. Władysław Gomułka gave a speech at Góra Świętej Anny on 1 May 1946 to honor the Poles killed fighting in the battle in 1921 and presented a line of continuity between the uprising of 1921 and his government. This was especially the case during the period when Gomułka was in power between 1956-1970 as he restored the tradition of celebrating the anniversary of the third uprising every May 3rd and often took part in the celebrations. 

The last veteran of the Silesian Uprisings, Wilhelm Meisel, died in 2009 at the age of 105. In 2021, a dispute emerged over plans to put up a monument in Opole honoring those who fought for Poland. The Social-Cultural Society of Germans in Opole Silesia, representing the last of the &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic German) minority in Silesia, called for a monument to honor both sides. The mayor of Opole stated he wanted to &quot;commemorate the heroes of the Silesian uprising who fought for Poland and not those who shot at them.&quot;

<doc id="404214" wikidata="Q2904618" url="?curid=404214" title="The Merchant's Tale">
<text>&quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Tale&quot; () is one of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. In it Chaucer subtly mocks antifeminist literature like that of Theophrastus (&quot;Theofraste&quot;). The tale also shows the influence of Boccaccio (&quot;Decameron&quot;: 7th day, 9th tale), Deschamps&#x27; , by Guillaume de Lorris (translated into English by Chaucer), Andreas Capellanus, Statius, and Cato. The tale is found in Persia in the Bahar Danush, in which the husband climbs a date tree instead of a pear tree. It could have arrived in Europe through the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, or perhaps the version in book VI of the &quot;Masnavi&quot; by Rumi. Though several of the tales are sexually explicit by modern standards, this one is especially so. Larry Benson remarks:

Many characters in this Tale have cratylic names: Januarie, the main character, is named in conjunction with his equally seasonal wife May, representing their individual characters: Januarie is , sharing the bare and unfruitful characteristics of his title month, whereas his youthful and wife represents the spring seasons. This has particular relevance when considering the parallel between this tale, and the Biblical tale of Adam and Eve. Januarie&#x27;s brothers are named Placebo and Justinus: the former a sycophant, whose name in Latin means &#x27;I will please&#x27;, and the latter a fairer man (&#x27;the just one&#x27;) with no individual motive.

The main character, Januarie (or January), a , is a 60-year-old knight from the town of Pavia, in Lombardy.

==Summary of the tale==

Januarie decides that he wants to marry, predominantly for the purpose of lawful recreational sex and to produce an heir, and he consults his two brothers, Placebo (meaning &#x27;I shall please&#x27;), who while encouraging him offers no personal opinion, and Justinus (meaning &#x27;he who is just&#x27;), who opposes marriage from his own experience. Januarie, a vain man, hears only the flattery of his sycophantic friend Placebo.

Januarie marries May, a young woman not yet 20 years old, largely out of lust and under the guise of religious acceptability. He chooses her after telling all of his friends to go and look for a wife for him.

A squire in Januarie&#x27;s court, called Damyan, falls in love with May and writes a letter to her confessing his desires: the goddess Venus at the wedding party – meaning she set his heart on fire with love. This could simply be a personification of Damyan falling in love, but since Pluto and Proserpina do physically intervene later, Damyan&#x27;s love could be seen as literally induced by Venus. May reciprocates his attraction and plots to have sex with him. Januarie creates a beautiful walled garden, reminiscent of the Garden of Eden as well as courtly love poetry, where he and May do have sex. Immediately after this Januarie is struck blind by Pluto. This disability causes him to become extremely jealous, and he keeps his hand on May at all times, to assure that she does not leave or commit adultery. However, during this time, May is able to give a copy of the garden key to Damyan, and they plan to consummate their love in the garden during one of Januarie and May&#x27;s trips there.

The day comes, and the married couple is in the garden, Damyan has creeped in before them using the key and hides in a pear tree, waiting for May. May, implying that she is pregnant and craving a pear, requests one from the tree and Januarie, old and blind, and therefore unable to reach, is persuaded to stoop and allow May to climb onto his back herself. In the tree, May is promptly greeted by her young lover Damyan, and they begin to have sex, described by the Merchant in a particularly lewd and bold fashion: Indeed, the narrator does apologise for this explicit description, addressing the pilgrims saying: 

Two gods are, at this moment, watching the adultery: husband and wife Pluto and Proserpina. They begin a passionate argument about the scene, in which Pluto condemns women&#x27;s morality. He decides that he will grant Januarie his sight back, but Proserpina will grant May the ability to talk her way out of the situation, saying, 

Januarie regains his sight – via Pluto&#x27;s intervention – just in time to see his wife and Damyan engaged in intercourse, but May successfully convinces him that his eyesight is deceiving him because it has only just been restored and that she is only &quot;struggling with a man&quot; because she was told this would get Januarie&#x27;s sight back.

The tale ends rather unexpectedly: the fooled Januarie and May continue to live happily. However, Chaucer does not end the tale entirely happily: a darker suggestion is there, as May tells Januarie that he may be mistaken on many more occasions (), indicating that, perhaps, her infidelity will not stop there.

==Fabliau debate==
One question that splits critics is whether the Merchant&#x27;s tale is a fabliau. Typically a description for a tale of carnal lust and frivolous bed-hopping, some would argue that especially the latter half of the tale, where Damyan and May have sex in the tree with the blind Januarie at the foot of the tree, represents fabliau. Derek Pearsall, for example, is in favour of this view. Some critics, such as Maurice Hussey, feel that Chaucer offers a great deal more sophistication and philosophical insight to put this on a level above fabliau.

==Sources and variants==
Similar tales are Boccaccio&#x27;s Story of Lydia and Pyrrhus and The Simpleton Husband from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights.&quot; Book IV of The &quot;Masnavi&quot; of Rumi contains another pear tree story.

==Adaptations==
On 27 February 2017, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama premiered a new, full-length operatic adaptation of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant&#x27;s Tale&quot; created by writer Stephen Plaice and composer Julian Philips, entitled &quot;The Tale of Januarie&quot;. Plaice created his libretto in Middle English not only adapting the original Chaucer text for an operatic setting, but also drawing on other works by Chaucer and creating entirely original Middle English lyrics. Philips and Plaice structured this adaptation across all four seasons of the calendar year, extending Chaucer&#x27;s original Tale into Autumn thereby following Januarie&#x27;s tale on beyond the grave. &quot;The Tale of Januarie&quot; is published by Peters Edition.

In Pasolini&#x27;s film &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, this story is adapted with Josephine Chaplin as May and Hugh Griffith as Sir January.

<text>Torre del Greco (; &quot;Greek man&#x27;s Tower&quot;) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Naples in Italy, with a population of c. 85,000 . The locals are sometimes called &quot;Corallini&quot; because of the once plentiful coral in the nearby sea, and because the city has been a major producer of coral jewellery and cameo brooches since the seventeenth century.

==History==

===Ancient period===


Tracing the history of Torre del Greco is difficult given the almost complete lack of historical documentary sources. Based on archaeological evidence, in Roman times Torre del Greco was probably a suburb of Herculaneum and, like elsewhere on the Bay of Naples such as at Oplontis and Stabiae, many patricians&#x27; villas would have lined the coast. In 79 AD the eruption of Vesuvius buried the area under volcanic ash.

The nearby Roman Villa Sora was a large and sumptuous residence with terraces down to the beach and overlooking the sea from its 150m-long frontage, dating from the 1st c. BC, whose excavated remains can be seen today. It was built on multiple levels like the Villa of the Papyri and on the beach below are the remains of a Roman bath complex (&quot;Terme Ginnasi&quot;) and quays would have been on the shore. It was embellished in the early imperial period and was being renovated in 79 AD probably after the 62 AD earthquake as shown by the piles of lime in some rooms, unfinished precious &quot;opus sectile&quot; floors made of imported marble and a famous graffito which recorded the cost of the work.

Many exquisite statues and frescos were found here firstly in the Bourbon excavations of the 1700s which are now in the museums such as Naples and the Palermo. Its size and quality implies it belonged to an important figure, possibly of the Imperial family judging by the spectacular frescoes which during the excavations of 1989 the area inspector considered closer to the Neronian Domus Aurea than to Pompeian houses.

It was rediscovered in 1974 by the GAV Archaeological Group. Further excavations in 1989–92 exposed the areas east and west of the apsidal hall, including service corridors, reception rooms, finely decorated bedrooms and the remains visible today. It was found that the top floor collapsed following the eruption while the bottom floor was buried by the ash. The middle floor can be visited today.

The remains of another maritime villa nearby at Terma-Ginnasio have been found which was terraced down to the shore and also had panoramic views of the Bay, similar to Villa A at Oplontis.

The so-called Villa Breglia was another maritime villa lying under the railway station and was partially excavated in 1934.

===Post-Roman period===
Later two villages are known to have been established in the area, Sora and Calastro. The Byzantine general Belisarius moved their inhabitants to Naples in 535. Around 700, it was also known as &quot;Turris Octava&quot;, the Latin for The Tower of Eight [sides] or The Eighth Tower, probably referring to a coastal watch tower. The current name appears for the first time in 1015; according to tradition, it stems from a Greek hermit who took up residence in the tower, or from the cultivation of a particular vine from Greece.

===Middle ages===

Torre del Greco was part of the royal estates of the Kingdom of Naples, until King Alfonso V of Aragon ceded it to the Carafa family.

In 1631 Torre del Greco was again damaged by an eruption of Vesuvius. Its citizens bought back their rights in 1699, after paying 106,000 ducats to their landlord, the Marquis of Monforte, and thenceforth the city flourished as a maritime trading and fishing port. The tradition of coral crafting dates from this time.

The historical centre of Torre del Greco was buried under a layer of lava in 1794.

=== 19th and early 20th century ===
At the time of the French rule of Joachim Murat, Torre del Greco, with 18,000 inhabitants, was the third largest mainland city in the Kingdom of Naples after Naples and Foggia.

Starting in the 16th century, wealthy families and even Italian nobility built elaborate summer palaces on the outskirts of the town. Among the most notable of these is the Palazzo Materazzo, renovated in the 1970s as a dance school, but later taken over by squatters after the 1980 Irpinia earthquake destroyed the homes of many of the poorer residents. In the 19th century, and continuing into the early 20th century, Torre del Greco was a popular summer resort for wealthy Italians.

In its heyday Torre del Greco was renowned for its cafés and eateries, particularly the &quot;Gran Caffè Palumbo&quot;, a large Art Nouveau café with an extensive outdoor pavilion known for its gelato, pastries, food and coffee. The comedian Totò was among those who made Torre del Greco their annual summer retreat. The reason for Torre del Greco&#x27;s popularity as a resort town was its fine beaches and the rural setting of lush farmlands and vineyards, as well as its close proximity to Vesuvius. As the town nearest to the volcano, Torre del Greco was the main starting point for tourists wishing to scale the mountain. This was facilitated by the Vesuvius Funicular, which took tourists to the crater from the town.

During World War II, the city was used as an ammunition depot by the German army, and consequently suffered heavy bombing by Allied forces.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Torre del Greco experiences a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;).

==Economy==
The city is the headquarters of Banca di Credito Popolare di Torre del Greco.

==Main sights==
*Roman archaeological remains, including the so-called Villa Sora (1st century AD), probably a property of the Flavians.
*The monastery of the Zoccolanti, with a cloister housing 28 frescoed panels depicting the life of Saint Francis of Assisi.
*The parish church of Santa Croce, whose baroque belltower was buried by lava in 1794.
*The 17th-century church of San Michele.
*Villa delle Ginestre, where the poet Giacomo Leopardi sojourned.
*The Museum of Coral.

==Cameos and coral jewellery==
Diving for coral has taken place in the Mediterranean Sea ever since Roman times, and in the 15th century Torre del Greco became known for its coral diving and harvesting of red coral. However, it was not until the 17th century that the first cameos were produced, and not until 1815 that a unique manufacturing contract was granted to the town by the King of Naples for a period of ten years. 

At present there are several hundred companies and several thousands of people employed in the manufacture of coral and shell cameos. Coral is now mainly imported from Asia, since areas in the Mediterranean are increasingly becoming protected. The total industry is estimated to have a turnover of around US$225 million.

<text>The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a radio drama series which aired in the USA from 1939 to 1950, it ran for 374 episodes, with many of the later episodes considered lost media. The series was based on the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. Some of the surviving episode recordings may be found online, in various audio quality condition.

For most of the show&#x27;s run, the program starred Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. Other actors played Holmes and Watson in later seasons.

==Production==
From the outset of the show, the series was billed in different listings under various titles including &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson&quot;, and other titles. The most popularly remembered title is &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. On occasion, the title of a radio episode differs from that of its original story – for example, the radio adaption of &quot;The Adventure of the Red Circle&quot; is entitled &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Lodger&quot;.

From 1939 until 1943, episodes were adapted or written by Edith Meiser who had written the earlier series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; which aired from 1930 to 1935. Meiser left the show after disagreements with a sponsor over the amount of violence in the program. It is also reported that Meiser left the show to focus on other projects. From 1943 onward, most episodes were written by the team of Denis Green and Anthony Boucher with some early episodes written by Green and Leslie Charteris. Edith Meiser returned to write for the show for its seventh season. Max Ehrlich and Howard Merrill wrote the episodes of season 8. Denis Green returned as a writer for the last season.

Originally, the show starred Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Doctor Watson. Together, they starred in 220 episodes which aired weekly on Mondays from 8:30 to 9:00 pm. Basil Rathbone&#x27;s last episode as the famous detective was &quot;The Singular Affair of the Baconian Cipher&quot;. He was eager to separate himself from the show to avoid being typecast in the role. On October 12, 1946, Tom Conway replaced him in the starring role, though Nigel Bruce got top billing. The new series lasted 39 episodes, and Bruce and Conway then left the series. From then until 1950 the series continued with various actors playing the two principal parts.

The show first aired on the Blue Network but later moved to the Mutual Broadcasting System. The show moved to Mutual in 1943 at the start of its fourth season. The series was originally broadcast from Hollywood. During World War II, the show was also broadcast overseas through the Armed Forces Radio Service. The program aired on ABC instead of Mutual for its sixth and ninth seasons.

Many episodes were recorded in front of a live audience.

==Cast==
*Sherlock Holmes:
** Basil Rathbone (1939–1946)
** Tom Conway (1947)
** John Stanley (1947–1949)
** Ben Wright (&quot;The Singular Affair of the Ancient Egyptian Curse&quot; in 1947, as stand-in for Tom Conway, 1949–1950 as a regular)

*Dr. Watson:
** Nigel Bruce (1939–1947)
** Joseph Kearns (&quot;The Haunting of Sherlock Holmes&quot; in 1946, stand-in for Nigel Bruce)
** Alfred Shirley (1947–1948)
** Ian Martin (1948)
** Wendell Holmes (credited as &quot;George Spelvin&quot;) (1948–1949)
** Eric Snowden (&quot;The Terrifying Cats&quot; in 1946, as a stand-in for Nigel Bruce, 1949–1950 as a regular)

There is only a limited amount of information available about additional cast members, since complete cast lists are available only for a handful of episodes. In multiple episodes, Mary Gordon played Mrs. Hudson, a role she also played in the 1939–1946 Sherlock Holmes film series featuring Rathbone and Bruce. Professor Moriarty was played by multiple actors in the radio series, including Joseph Kearns (who also played Watson) and Lou Merrill.

Frederick Worlock played Inspector Lestrade in at least three known episodes. Worlock also played different roles in multiple films in the 1939–1946 film series, such as the role of Geoffrey Musgrave in &quot;Sherlock Holmes Faces Death&quot;. Lestrade was played by Bernard Lenrow in the seventh season and Horace Braham in the eighth season. Rex Evans played Mycroft Holmes in at least two known episodes. Evans played an assassin in the Sherlock Holmes film &quot;Pursuit to Algiers&quot;.

In each episode, the announcer would be presented as arriving at the home of Dr. Watson, then retired, who would share a story about Holmes and his adventures. The announcer for the first three seasons of the show was Knox Manning. In various episodes of the fourth season, the announcers were Owen Babbe, Marx Hartman, and Bob Campbell. Harry Bartell became the announcer for the fifth season. The announcer for the sixth season was Joseph Bell. Bell had previously been the announcer for &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Cy Harrice took over the role for the seventh and eighth seasons. Herb Allen was the announcer for the ninth season.

Actors who performed in multiple roles on the show include Verna Felton, Paula Winslowe, Carl Harbord (who also played Inspector Hopkins in the Sherlock Holmes film &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;), Herbert Rawlinson, Paul Frees, Theodore von Eltz, and June Foray.

==Sponsors==

The show&#x27;s announcer acted as the spokesman for the sponsor. Grove&#x27;s Bromo Quinine sponsored the show for the first three seasons. Petri Wine was the sponsor for the fourth and fifth seasons. Petri Wine stopped sponsoring the show after the end of the fifth season. While Rathbone left the show at the same time, the reason Petri ceased their sponsorship was unconnected to Rathbone&#x27;s departure according to one source, which states that the decision was made because it was more affordable for Petri to sponsor the radio series &quot;The Casebook of Gregory Hood&quot; instead.

The sponsor for the series was Kreml Hair Tonic for the show&#x27;s sixth season, and the Trimount Clothing Co. for the seventh season. Trimount renewed their sponsorship for the eighth season. Petri Wine returned as the sponsor for the ninth season. By May 1950, it was confirmed that Petri did not plan to renew their sponsorship if the series continued.

==Episodes==

Season 1 (October 2, 1939 – March 11, 1940; 24 episodes) started with an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&quot; and ended with an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Retired Colourman&quot;. The last episode of the season was originally intended to be an adaptation of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. It is not known why the change was made, but it may be because &quot;The Final Problem&quot; had already been used on radio several times. It was announced on the penultimate show that &quot;The Final Problem&quot; would be the last episode; in the final episode, Watson said he had changed his mind about which story he was going to tell.

Season 2 (September 29, 1940 – March 9, 1941; 24 episodes) started with an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;. The last episode was an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place&quot;. The season included a six-episode serial adapted from &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;.

Season 3 (5 October 1941 – March 1, 1942; 22 episodes) started with an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Illustrious Client&quot; and ended with an episode titled &quot;The Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot;. An episode also titled &quot;The Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot;, inspired by a reference in &quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&quot;, had previously aired in 1932 in the second season of the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

Season 4 (May 7, 1943 – May 28, 1945; 109 episodes) started with a dramatization of &quot;The Adventure of the Copper Beeches&quot;. The last episode of the season is titled &quot;Dance of Death&quot;. According to the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;, Nigel Bruce &quot;astounded sound engineers&quot; by imitating the sound of a seagull required for the episode &quot;Death in Cornwall&quot;, which aired on February 7, 1944. Some episodes in this season and the following two seasons were novelized by H. Paul Jeffers in his 2005 book &quot;The Forgotten Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

Season 5 (September 3, 1945 – May 27, 1946; 39 episodes) started with an episode titled &quot;The Case of the Limping Ghost&quot;, based on an incident in &quot;The Adventure of the Crooked Man&quot;. The last episode of the season was &quot;The Singular Affair of the Baconian Cipher&quot;, suggested by an incident in &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;. This was the last season with Basil Rathbone playing Sherlock Holmes. Rathbone and Bruce also appeared on the CBS radio program &quot;Request Performance&quot; in November 1945, and swapped roles as Holmes and Watson in a short sketch performance on the program. Some of the episodes in this season were novelized by Ken Greenwald in his book &quot;The Lost Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1989).

Season 6 (October 12, 1946 – July 7, 1947; 39 episodes) started with the episode &quot;The Adventure of the Stuttering Ghost&quot;, suggested by an incident in &quot;The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor&quot;. The season ended with &quot;The Adventure of the Iron Maiden&quot;. This was the last season with Nigel Bruce playing Watson.

Season 7 (September 28, 1947 – June 20, 1948; 39 episodes) started with &quot;The Case of the Dog Who Changed His Mind&quot; and ended with an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger&quot;.

Season 8 (September 12, 1948 – June 6, 1949; 39 episodes) started with an episode titled &quot;The Case of the Unwelcome Ambassador&quot; and ended with an episode titled &quot;The Adventure of the Red Death&quot;.

Season 9 (September 21, 1949 – June 14, 1950; 39 episodes) started with an episode with an unknown title. The second episode, which aired on September 28, 1949, was titled &quot;The Eloquent Corpse&quot;. Many of this season&#x27;s episodes, including the last two episodes, have unknown titles. The last episode with a known title is &quot;Command Performance&quot;, which aired on May 31, 1950.

Scripts of some missing episodes have been published by Purview Press. &#x27;Sherlock Holmes:The Lost Radio Scripts&#x27; (), &#x27;Sherlock Holmes: More Lost Radio Scripts&#x27; () edited by Ian Dickerson.

<doc id="404226" wikidata="Q273924" url="?curid=404226" title="Glycemic index">
<text>The glycemic (glycaemic) index (GI; ) is a number from 0 to 100 assigned to a food, with pure glucose arbitrarily given the value of 100, which represents the relative rise in the blood glucose level two hours after consuming that food. The GI of a specific food depends primarily on the quantity and type of carbohydrate it contains, but is also affected by the amount of entrapment of the carbohydrate molecules within the food, the fat and protein content of the food, the amount of organic acids (or their salts) in the food, and whether it is cooked and, if so, how it is cooked. GI tables, which list many types of foods and their GIs, are available. A food is considered to have a &quot;low GI&quot; if it is 55 or less; &quot;high GI&quot; if 70 or more; and &quot;mid-range GI&quot; if 56 to 69.

The term was introduced in 1981 by David J. Jenkins and co-workers. It is useful for quantifying the relative rapidity with which the body breaks down carbohydrates. It takes into account only the available carbohydrate (total carbohydrate minus fiber) in a food. Glycemic index does not predict an individual&#x27;s glycemic response to a food, but can be used as a tool to assess the insulin response burden of a food, averaged across a studied population. Individual responses vary greatly.

The glycemic index is usually applied in the context of the quantity of the food and the amount of carbohydrate in the food that is actually consumed. A related measure, the glycemic load (GL), factors this in by multiplying the glycemic index of the food in question by the carbohydrate content of the actual serving.

==Measurement==
The glycemic index of a food is defined as the incremental area under the two-hour blood glucose response curve (AUC) following a 12-hour fast and ingestion of a food with a certain quantity of available carbohydrate (usually 50 g). The AUC of the test food is divided by the AUC of the standard (either glucose or white bread, giving two different definitions) and multiplied by 100. The average GI value is calculated from data collected in 10 human subjects. Both the standard and test food must contain an equal amount of available carbohydrate. The result gives a relative ranking for each tested food.

Foods with carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion and release glucose rapidly into the bloodstream tend to have a high GI; foods with carbohydrates that break down more slowly, releasing glucose more gradually into the bloodstream, tend to have a low GI.

A lower glycemic index suggests slower rates of digestion and absorption of the foods&#x27; carbohydrates and can also indicate greater extraction from the liver and periphery of the products of carbohydrate digestion.

The current validated methods use glucose as the reference food, giving it a glycemic index value of 100 by definition. This has the advantages of being universal and producing maximum GI values of approximately 100. White bread can also be used as a reference food, giving a different set of GI values (if white bread = 100, then glucose ≈ 140). For people whose staple carbohydrate source is white bread, this has the advantage of conveying directly whether replacement of the dietary staple with a different food would result in faster or slower blood glucose response. A disadvantage with using white bread as a reference food is that it is not a well-defined reference: there is no universal standard for the carbohydrate content of white bread.

==Accuracy==
Glycemic index charts often give only one value per food, but variations are possible due to:
* Ripeness — riper fruits contain more sugars, increasing GI
* Cooking methods — the more cooked, or overcooked, a food, the more its cellular structure is broken, with a tendency for it to digest quickly and raise blood glucose more
* Processing — e.g., flour has a higher GI than the whole grain from which it is ground as grinding breaks the grain&#x27;s protective layers and the length of storage. Potatoes are a notable example, ranging from moderate to very high GI even within the same variety.
* Consumption order — changing the order that foods are eaten was demonstrated to affect blood glucose levels, where eating starches or sugars first resulted in faster increases than when eaten after the rest of the meal

More importantly, the glycemic response is different from one person to another, and also in the same person from day to day, depending on blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and other factors.

The glycemic index only indicates the impact on glucose level two hours after eating the food. People with diabetes have elevated levels for four hours or longer after eating certain foods.

==Grouping==
GI values can be interpreted intuitively as percentages on an absolute scale and are commonly interpreted as follows:

A low-GI food will cause blood glucose levels to increase more slowly and steadily, which leads to lower postprandial (after meal) blood glucose readings. A high-GI food causes a more rapid rise in blood glucose level and is suitable for energy recovery after exercise or for a person experiencing hypoglycemia.

The glycemic effect of foods depends on various factors, such as the type of starch (amylose versus amylopectin), physical entrapment of the starch molecules within the food, fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal. The presence of fat or soluble dietary fiber can slow the gastric emptying rate, thus lowering the GI. In general, coarse, grainy breads with higher amounts of fiber have a lower GI value than white breads.

Many modern diets rely on the glycemic index, including the South Beach Diet, Transitions by Market America and NutriSystem Nourish Diet. However, others have pointed out that foods generally considered to be unhealthy can have a low glycemic index, for instance, chocolate cake (GI 38), ice cream (37), or pure fructose (19), whereas foods like potatoes and rice have GIs around 100 but are commonly eaten in some countries with low rates of diabetes.

==Application==
===Weight control===
Dietary replacement of saturated fats by carbohydrates with a low glycemic index may be beneficial for weight control, whereas substitution with refined, high glycemic index carbohydrates is not. However, a 2023 Cochrane review did not find that adoption of low glycemic index (or load) diets by people who are overweight or obese leads to more weight loss (and better fat control) than use of diets involving higher glycemic index/load or other strategies.

In clinical management of obesity, diets based on a low glycemic index/load appear to provide better glycemic and inflammatory control than ones based on a high glycemic index/load (and therefore could potentially be more effective in preventing obesity-related diseases). In overweight and obese children, adoption of low glycemic index/load diets may not lead to weight loss but might potentially provide other benefits.

==Limitations==
===Compared to quantity of carbohydrate===
Depending on quantities, the number of grams of carbohydrate in a food can have a bigger impact on blood sugar levels than the glycemic index does. Consuming less dietary energy, losing weight, and carbohydrate counting can be better for lowering the blood sugar level. Carbohydrates impact glucose levels most profoundly, and two foods with the same carbohydrate content are, in general, comparable in their effects on blood sugar. A food with a low glycemic index can have a high carbohydrate content or vice versa; this can be accounted for with the glycemic load (GL) where .

===Compared to insulin index===
While the glycemic index of foods is used as a guide to the rise in blood glucose that should follow meals containing those foods, actual increases in blood glucose show considerable variability from person to person, even after consumption of identical meals. This is in part because glycemic index does not take into account other factors besides glycemic response, such as insulin response, which is measured by the insulin index and can be more appropriate in representing the effects from some food contents other than carbohydrates. In particular, since it is based on the area under the curve of the glucose response over time from ingesting a subject food, the shape of the curve has no bearing on the corresponding GI value. The glucose response can rise to a high level and fall quickly, or rise less high but remain there for a longer time, and have the same area under the curve.
