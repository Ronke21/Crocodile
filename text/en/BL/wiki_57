<text>Cape Maleas (also &quot;Cape Malea&quot;; , colloquially Καβομαλιάς, &quot;Cavomaliás&quot;), anciently Malea () and Maleae or Maleai (Μαλέαι), is a peninsula and cape in the southeast of the Peloponnese in Greece. To distinguish it from the cape, the peninsula is sometimes referred to as &quot;Epidavros Limira&quot; peninsula, after the most prominent ancient city located on it. It separates the Laconian Gulf in the west from the Aegean Sea in the east. It is the second most southerly point of mainland Greece (after Cape Matapan) and once featured one of the largest light-houses in the Mediterranean. The seas around the cape are notoriously treacherous and difficult to navigate, featuring variable weather and occasionally very powerful storms.

==Geography==

Cape Maleas is in the regional unit of Laconia. The municipality of Monemvasia covers the entire peninsula and part of the eastern coast. The municipal unit of Voies () is located in the southern extremity of the peninsula, with Neapoli, the largest town on the peninsula.

To the west of the peninsula lies the island of Elafonisos, known for its long, light-coloured sandy beaches.

==History==
In ancient times it was a busy shipping lane, and one of the major routes for crossing from the northeast Mediterranean to the west. The cape was notorious for its bad weather at the time as well, most famously as recounted in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and much later by Xenophon in &quot;Hellenica.&quot; Homer describes how Odysseus on his return home to Ithaca rounds Cape Maleas only to be blown off course, resulting in his being lost for up to 10 years by some people&#x27;s reckoning. Xenophon records the occasion when Callicratidas camped his sailors for dinner before attacking the Athenians in Arginusae, when a thunderstorm delayed Callicratidas&#x27;s embarkment.

The Cape&#x27;s importance declined with the opening of the Corinth Canal, which allowed ships to bypass the Peloponnese rather than circumnavigating it. However, it still has significant amounts of sea traffic as the Corinth Canal can only accommodate ships less than 21m in width.

In World War II, the German occupying forces began construction of a military tower for defense and surveillance of the major shipping lane. The construction was halted with the end of occupation in 1944.

<doc id="403777" wikidata="Q1976354" url="?curid=403777" title="Friendly society">
<text>A friendly society (sometimes called a benefit society, mutual aid society, benevolent society, fraternal organization or ROSCA) is a mutual association for the purposes of insurance, pensions, savings or cooperative banking. It is a mutual organization or benefit society composed of a body of people who join together for a common financial or social purpose. Before modern insurance and the welfare state, friendly societies provided financial and social services to individuals, often according to their religious, political, or trade affiliations. These societies are still widespread in many parts of the developing world, where they are referred to as ROSCAs (rotating savings and credit associations), ASCAs (accumulating savings and credit associations), burial societies, chit funds, etc.

==Character==
Before the development of large-scale government and employer health insurance and other financial services, friendly societies played an important part in many people&#x27;s lives. Many of these societies still exist. In some countries, some of them developed into large mutually-run financial institutions, typically insurance companies, and lost any social and ceremonial aspect they may have had; in others they continue to have a role based on solidarity and democracy without an objective to make profit. The current position of the mutual benefit society in Europe is well described in a report from 2012, commissioned by the European Commission. Healthcare mutuals worldwide are coming together in Association Internationale de la Mutualité, a Brussels-based association of healthcare mutuals.

===United Kingdom===
Friendly societies in countries such as the United Kingdom were subject to prudential regulation to safeguard the financial interests of their members and secure the benefits promised to them, but the legislation (see for example the Friendly Societies Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 60)) was separate from that applicable to insurance companies. In other countries friendly societies have no specific legal status, which means that they have to comply to the same rules and regulations as for-profit insurance companies.

In some cases, especially in America, members typically paid a regular membership fee and went to lodge meetings to take part in ceremonies. If members became sick, they would receive an allowance to help them meet their financial obligations. The society might have a doctor whom the member could consult for free. Members of the lodge would visit to provide emotional and other support (and possibly to verify that the sick member was not malingering). When a member died, the funeral would be paid for and the members of the lodge might attend in ceremonial dress. Often, there was some money left over for the next of kin.

Friendly societies might also organize social functions such as dances, and some had sports teams for members. They occasionally became involved in political issues that were of interest to their members. Others were purely financial, with little or no social side, from their foundation—this was more typical in Britain. The first mutual savings bank, founded in Scotland in 1810, was called the &quot;Savings and Friendly Society&quot;. Credit unions and other types of organization are modern equivalents.

Friendly society brasses were the emblems of village friendly societies or clubs common in the west of England between the late 18th and early 20th centuries. The use of brasses as emblems was particularly prevalent in Somerset and the surrounding counties. The Museum of English Rural Life has a collection of over 900 Friendly Society Brasses aka poleheads. The design of the brasses was sometimes conventional or sometimes represented an interest of the club such as the inn in which the meetings were held.

== Female friendly societies ==
Female friendly societies became a common form of friendly society in England during the 19th century e.g. the York Female Friendly Society, founded in 1788 by Faith Gray and Catherine Cappe. Grey and Cappe ran schools for girls and this society was intended to assist them. Another early Female Society was the Wisbech Female Friendly Society instituted on 1 February 1796.

==Registration and regulation==

===Australia===
In Australia, friendly societies are regulated under the Life Insurance Act 1995 (C&#x27;th) and registered with APRA.

Friendly societies were first established in Australia by community groups in the 1830s and have evolved into member-focused providers of financial services, healthcare, retirement living, aged and home care services, transport, pharmacies and other fraternal services to over 800,000 members. They typically provide savings, investment and insurance products. 

===Ireland===
In Ireland, friendly societies are registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Friendly Societies Acts 1896–2014 (the Registrar for Companies is also the Registrar for Friendly Societies, Industrial and Provident Societies and Trade Unions).

In 2014 the Friendly Societies and Industrial and Provident Societies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2014, provided for the cessation of new friendly societies; as a result no new societies may be registered. It was felt that the form of organisation had outlived its usefulness, largely for reasons mentioned above. When the minister&#x27;s staff examined the register, it was found that only three new societies had registered in the previous nine years, as the use of the traditional friendly society types of business had become regulated elsewhere and a &#x27;rump&#x27;, which on examination are largely public-service types, remain (mainly army, customs, gardaí, and prison officers). Many of the others could expect to cease to trade if additional, or a normal regulatory environment was required (similar to companies, health and other business (loan organisations). The 2014 Act also provided that existing societies may not establish a &#x27;loan fund&#x27; from the commencement of the Act (July 28, 2014).

===United Kingdom===
Friendly societies are registered under either the &#x27; (c. 46) or the &#x27; (c. 40). There are the following types of society registered under the Friendly Societies Act 1974: 
* friendly societies
* working men&#x27;s clubs
* benevolent societies
* cattle insurance societies
* specially authorised societies

The activities of these societies varies, but includes:
* running a social club
* providing discretionary benefits to members – for instance during sickness or unemployment
* running sports clubs
* managing allotments
* insuring cattle

Some friendly societies are still governed by the 1974 act, although no new societies can be registered under that act. Friendly societies registered under the Friendly Societies Act 1992 are incorporated entities and are registered for effecting and carrying out contracts of insurance.

Similar organisations were called industrial and provident societies. They are trading businesses or voluntary organisations. 
Recent legal developments in Great Britain include the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, which has renamed these societies as co-operative or community benefit societies. Examples include co-operatives for consumers, workers, agriculture and housing, working men&#x27;s clubs, Women&#x27;s Institute markets, allotment societies, mutual investment companies, housing associations and some social enterprises. Many sports clubs are registered under these provisions.

Friendly societies, alongside other mutual societies, are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority. Until December 2001, the regulator was the Registrar of Friendly Societies, and from then until April 2013 the Financial Services Authority.

<doc id="403782" wikidata="Q6763928" url="?curid=403782" title="Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi">
<text>Donna Marina [[Torlonia]] dei Principi di Civitella-Cesi (22 October 1916 – 15 September 1960) was an Italian-American aristocrat, best known as the paternal grandmother of the actress and model Brooke Shields.

==Family==

Torlonia was born in Rome, at Palazzo Núñez-Torlonia, the youngest daughter of Marino Torlonia, 4th Prince of Civitella-Cesi and his American wife, Mary Elsie Moore, a daughter of Charles Arthur Moore, a hardware merchant from Connecticut. The Torlonia family gained its fortune in the administration of Vatican finances.

She had three siblings:
*&quot;Donna&quot; Olimpia Torlonia dei Principi di Civitella-Chesi (1909–1924)
*&quot;Don&quot; Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince of Civitella-Cesi, the husband of Infanta Beatriz of Spain (an aunt of King Juan Carlos I of Spain).
*&quot;Donna&quot; Cristina Torlonia dei Principi di Civitella-Cesi (1913–1974)

== About ==
In February 1934, Torlonia had made her New York City debut. Torlonia enjoyed going to nightclubs and charity work, and in 1934 she led many charity fundraising efforts. Some of the charity fundraisers she was involved with include the American Auxiliary Hospital in Mougins, France, the Italian Welfare League, New York City Cancer Institute, the New York Diet Kitchen Association, the Babies Hospital of the City of New York, Soldiers and Sailors Club of New York, New York Exchange for Woman&#x27;s Work, Woman&#x27;s Auxiliary of the Osteopathic Clinic of New York, Goddard Neighborhood Centre, Children&#x27;s Village at Dobbs Ferry, New York, among others.

In 1936, Torlonia was dressed as &quot;wealth&quot; with a tall headdress and two hand maids at one of a nationwide set of birthday celebrations for President Roosevelt. The following year in 1937 at the Roosevelt Birthday Ball Torlonia was one of a hundred women specially dressed to celebrate the event, she was dressed as &quot;The East&quot;, representing the Eastern United States fashion, and in attendance was the President&#x27;s mother Sara Roosevelt.

Sculptor Marino Marini created a wax portrait of Marina Torlonia in 1935.

==Marriages==
&quot;Donna&quot; Marina Torlonia dei Principi di Civitella-Cesi was married twice, her husbands being:
*Francis Xavier Shields (1909–1975), the American amateur tennis player. They married on 13 June 1940, in North Conway, New Hampshire, and divorced in 1950. The Shieldses had two children: a son, Francis Alexander Shields and a daughter, Marina Shields.
*Edward W. Slater, an architect and partner at architectural firm Slater and Chiat, whom she married on 29 December 1950. They had one son, Edward Torlonia Slater (born 1955).
Torlonia was the paternal grandmother of American actress Brooke Shields, the daughter of her son Francis Alexander Shields.

==Death==
Torlonia died on 15 September 1960, in an automobile accident in Piacenza, Italy, shortly after leaving the wedding of her nephew Marco Torlonia, 6th Prince of Civitella-Cesi, to princess Orsetta Caracciolo, niece of film director Luchino Visconti. Duke Raffaele Canevaro di Zoagli and his mother-in-law, Eleanor Terry, were also killed in the accident.

<doc id="403783" wikidata="Q1144214" url="?curid=403783" title="Robert Heilbroner">
<text>Robert L. Heilbroner (March 24, 1919 – January 4, 2005) was an American economist and historian of economic thought. The author of some two dozen books, Heilbroner was best known for &quot;The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers&quot; (1953), a survey of the lives and contributions of famous economists, notably Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and John Maynard Keynes.

==Early life and education==

Heilbroner was born in 1919, in New York City, to a wealthy German Jewish family. His father, Louis Heilbroner, was a businessman who founded the men&#x27;s clothing retailer Weber &amp; Heilbroner. Robert graduated from Harvard University in 1940 with a &quot;summa cum laude&quot; degree in philosophy, government and economics. During World War II, he served in the United States Army and worked at the Office of Price Control under John Kenneth Galbraith, the highly celebrated and controversial Institutionalist economist.

==Career==
After World War II, Heilbroner worked briefly as a banker and entered into academia in the 1950s as a research fellow at the New School for Social Research in New York. During this period, he was highly influenced by the German economist Adolph Lowe, who was a foremost representative of the German Historical School. In 1963, Heilbroner earned a Ph.D. in Economics from the New School for Social Research, where he was subsequently appointed Norman Thomas Professor of Economics in 1971, and where he remained for more than twenty years. He mainly taught History of Economic Thought courses at the New School.

Although a highly unconventional economist, who regarded himself as more of a social theorist and &quot;worldly philosopher&quot; (philosopher pre-occupied with &quot;worldly&quot; affairs, such as economic structures), and who tended to integrate the disciplines of history, economics and philosophy, Heilbroner was nevertheless recognized by his peers as a prominent economist. He was elected vice president of the American Economic Association in 1972.

He also came up with a way of classifying economies, as either Traditional (primarily agriculturally based, perhaps subsistence economy), Command (centrally planned economy, often involving the state), Market (capitalism), or Mixed.

Though an outspoken socialist for nearly his entire career, Heilbroner famously wrote in a 1989 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union:
:Less than 75 years after it officially began, the contest between capitalism and socialism is over: capitalism has won... Capitalism organizes the material affairs of humankind more satisfactorily than socialism.

He further wrote in &quot;Dissent&quot; in 1992 that &quot;capitalism has been as unmistakable a success as socialism has been a failure&quot; and complimented Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, and Ludwig von Mises on their insistence of the free market&#x27;s superiority. He emphasized that &quot;democratic liberties have not yet appeared, except fleetingly, in any nation that has declared itself to be fundamentally anticapitalist.&quot; However, Heilbroner&#x27;s preferred capitalist model was the highly redistributionist welfare states of Scandinavia; he stated that his model society was &quot;a slightly idealized Sweden.&quot;

==Family==
Robert Heilbroner had two sons, David and Peter Heilbroner, and four grandchildren, Quentin, Katrina, Henry, and Sam.

Heilbroner died in 2005 in New York City at the age of 85.

== &quot;The Worldly Philosophers&quot; ==
Published in 1953, &quot;The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers&quot; (1953) has sold nearly four million copies, making it the second-best-selling economics text of all time (the first being Paul Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;Economics&quot;, a highly popular university textbook). The seventh edition of the book, published in 1999, included a new final chapter entitled &quot;The End of Worldly Philosophy?&quot;, which included both a grim view on the existent state of economics as well as a hopeful vision for a &quot;reborn worldly philosophy&quot; that incorporated social aspects of capitalism. Its content is:
# Introduction
# The Economic Revolution
# The Wonderful World of Adam Smith
# The Gloomy Presentiments of Parson Malthus and David Ricardo
# The Dreams of the Utopian Socialists
#: about Robert Owen, Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and John Stuart Mill

# The Victorian World and the Underworld of Economics
#: about Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, Frederic Bastiat, Henry George, John A. Hobson, and Alfred Marshall

<doc id="403786" wikidata="Q693026" url="?curid=403786" title="Smear campaign">
<text>A smear campaign, also referred to as a smear tactic or simply a smear, is an effort to damage or call into question someone&#x27;s reputation, by propounding negative propaganda. It makes use of discrediting tactics. It can be applied to individuals or groups. Common targets are public officials, politicians, heads of state, political candidates, activists, celebrities (especially those who are involved in politics), and ex-spouses. The term also applies in other contexts, such as the workplace. The term &quot;smear campaign&quot; became popular around the year 1936.

==Definition==
A smear campaign is an intentional, premeditated effort to undermine an individual&#x27;s or group&#x27;s reputation, credibility, and character. Like negative campaigning, most often smear campaigns target government officials, politicians, political candidates, and other public figures. However, public relations campaigns might also employ smear tactics in the course of managing an individual or institutional brand to target competitors and potential threats. Discrediting tactics are used to discourage people from believing in the figure or supporting their cause, such as the use of damaging quotations.

Smear tactics differ from normal discourse or debate in that they do not bear upon the issues or arguments in question. A smear is a simple attempt to malign a group or an individual with the aim of undermining their credibility.

Smears often consist of &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks in the form of unverifiable rumors and distortions, half-truths, or even outright lies; smear campaigns are often propagated by gossip magazines. Even when the facts behind a smear campaign are demonstrated to lack proper foundation, the tactic is often effective because the target&#x27;s reputation is tarnished before the truth is known.

Smear campaigns can also be used as a campaign tactic associated with tabloid journalism, which is a type of journalism that presents little well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines, scandal-mongering and sensationalism. For example, during Gary Hart&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign (see below), the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported on its front page big, black block letters: &quot;GARY: I&#x27;M NO WOMANIZER.&quot;

Smears are also effective in diverting attention away from the matter in question and onto a specific individual or group. The target of the smear typically must focus on correcting the false information rather than on the original issue.

Deflection has been described as a &quot;wrap-up smear&quot;: &quot;You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge&quot;.
== In court cases ==
In the U.S. judicial system, discrediting tactics (called witness impeachment) are the approved method for attacking the credibility of any witness in court, including a plaintiff or defendant. In cases with significant mass media attention or high-stakes outcomes, those tactics often take place in public as well.

Logically, an argument is held in discredit if the underlying premise is found, &quot;So severely in error that there is cause to remove the argument from the proceedings because of its prejudicial context and application...&quot;. Mistrial proceedings in civil and criminal courts do not always require that an argument brought by defense or prosecution be discredited, however appellate courts must consider the context and may discredit testimony as perjurious or prejudicial, even if the statement is technically true.

==Targets==
Smear tactics are commonly used to undermine effective arguments or critiques.

===John C. Frémont – 1856 US presidential election candidate===

During the 1856 presidential election, John C. Frémont was the target of a smear campaign alleging that he was a Catholic. The campaign was designed to undermine support for Fremont from those who were suspicious of Catholics.

===General Motors against Ralph Nader===
Ralph Nader was the victim of a smear campaign during the 1960s, when he was campaigning for car safety. In order to smear Nader and deflect public attention from his campaign, General Motors engaged private investigators to search for damaging or embarrassing incidents from his past. In early March 1966, several media outlets, including &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reported that GM had tried to discredit Nader, hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations. Nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for $284,000. Nader&#x27;s lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals, whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover &quot;overzealous surveillance.&quot; Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.

===Gary Hart – 1988 US presidential candidate===
Gary Hart was the target of a smear campaign during the 1988 US presidential campaign. The &quot;New York Post&quot; once reported on its front page big, black block letters: &quot;GARY: I&#x27;M NO WOMANIZER.&quot;

===China against Apple Inc.===
In 2011, China launched a smear campaign against Apple, including TV and radio advertisements and articles in state-run papers. The campaign failed to turn the Chinese public against the company and its products.

===Chris Bryant===
Chris Bryant, a British parliamentarian, accused Russia in 2012 of orchestrating a smear campaign against him because of his criticism of Vladimir Putin. In 2017 he alleged that other British officials are vulnerable to Russian smear campaigns.

===Blake Lively===
In 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on a smear campaign conducted against actress Blake Lively after she accused Justin Baldoni of misconduct. The alleged smear campaign, which was purported to be led by Melissa Nathan and Jed Wallace, allegedly pushed negative stories about Lively and used social media to boost those stories. In January 2025, Baldoni filed a suit Baldoni filed a suit in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against Blake, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and publicist Leslie Sloane, for $400 million in damages alleging civil extortion, defamation, and a slew of contract-related claims.

===Overstock critics===
In January 2007, it was revealed that an anonymous website that attacked critics of Overstock.com, including media figures and private citizens on message boards, was operated by an official of Overstock.com.

=== UAE smear campaigns ===
In 2023, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reported that Mohamed bin Zayed was paying millions of euros to a Swiss firm, Alp Services for orchestrating a smear campaign to defame the Emirati targets, including Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. Under the ‘dark PR’, Alp posted false and defamatory Wikipedia entries against them. The Emirates also paid the Swiss firm to publish propaganda articles against the targets. Multiple meetings took place between the Alp Services head Mario Brero and an Emirati official, Matar Humaid al-Neyadi. However, Alp’s bills were sent directly to MbZ. The defamation campaign also targeted an American, Hazim Nada, and his firm, Lord Energy, because his father Youssef Nada had joined the Muslim Brotherhood as a teenager.

<text>USS &quot;Dorado&quot; (SS-248), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first submarine of the United States Navy to be named for the dorado.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Dorado&quot;′s keel was laid down on 27 August 1942 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 23 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Ezra G. Allen, wife of Rear Admiral Ezra G. Allen, Budget Officer of the United States Department of the Navy, and commissioned on 28 August 1943.

==Service history==

&quot;Dorado&quot;″s sea trials proved the readiness of the crew, and she sailed from Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, on 6 October 1943 for the Panama Canal Zone. She did not arrive.

The standard practice of imposing bombing restrictions within an area ahead, astern, and on each side of the scheduled position of an unescorted submarine making passage in friendly waters had been carried out and all concerned had been notified. However, the crew of a PBM Mariner flying boat of Patrol Squadron 210 (VP-210) based at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, assigned to provide air coverage on the evening of 12 October 1943 had received an incorrect description of the restriction area, out of place.

At 2049 local time, under a moonlit but stormy sky, that plane attacked an unidentified submarine that it believed was outside the restriction area with three Mark-47 depth charges and a Mark-4 Mod-4 demolition bomb. About two hours later, the plane sighted a second submarine with which it attempted to exchange recognition signals. This second submarine fired upon the plane.

A convoy scheduled to pass through the restricted area surrounding &quot;Dorado&quot; on the evening of 12 October 1943 reported no contact.

Air searches were begun immediately after 14 October 1943, &quot;Dorado&quot;′s scheduled date of arrival in the Panama Canal Zone. Widely scattered oil slicks with occasional debris were found. Subsequently, the Board of Investigation held in Guantánamo Bay, and the more formal Naval Board of Inquiry held at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., found that the &quot;widely scattered oil slicks&quot; were actually oleous in nature and not bunker oil or diesel fuel - most probably rotting vegetation like seaweed. All of the &quot;occasional debris&quot; was determined not to have come from &quot;Dorado&quot;.

At both the Board of Investigation and the Court of Inquiry, the aircrew testified that they were certain that both submarines they had attacked were U-boats. Despite the circumstantial evidence, there are reasons to doubt that &quot;Dorado&quot; was sunk by the Mariner. Because the crew knew that &quot;Dorado&quot; was operating in the area, they carefully observed their two targets before attacking. Prior to the first attack, the four crewmen of the aircraft observed the surfaced submarine for 12 minutes, noting:

* it was from where they had been told to expect &quot;Dorado&quot; to be and from where &quot;Dorado&quot; really was supposed to be
* it was heading almost 90 degrees off from &quot;Dorado&quot;’s base course
* it had no guns on the fore deck, where &quot;Dorado&quot; carried a five-inch (127 mm) gun
* it had an entirely grooved deck, where &quot;Dorado&quot;″s deck was grooved only near the conning tower
* it had a &quot;knob-like&quot; object on the front of the conning tower, almost certainly the Metox radar detector installed on Type IX U-boats

Post-war examination of &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; records indicate that the submarine first attacked by the Mariner may have been , though that boat&#x27;s logs do not record the attack. It is possible that the attack went unnoticed by the boat; of the three depth charges and one bomb that were dropped, one depth charge was a confirmed dud, one was dropped too low to arm, and neither the third depth charge nor the bomb were seen to explode. After the attack, the Mariner searched the area for 20 minutes, but saw no explosions, bubbles, or debris.

The second submarine, attacked by the Mariner two hours later, was certainly &quot;U-214&quot;; her log book, captured after World War II, describes firing at the aircraft.

On 8 October, off Colón, &quot;U-214&quot; laid a minefield of 15 mines. One of these may have sunk &quot;Dorado&quot; on or about 14 October 1943.

&quot;Dorado&quot; was one of only two U.S. Navy submarines lost in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. The other was , which sank during a training dive near Key West, Florida.

==Legacy==

A memorial to &quot;Dorado&quot; stands on the Arkansas River in Veterans Memorial Park in Wichita, Kansas.

A 614-page book entitled &quot;USS &quot;Dorado&quot; (SS-248): On Eternal Patrol&quot; was published by Douglas E. Campbell in November 2011.

Before she was lost, the American painter Thomas Hart Benton sailed aboard &quot;Dorado&quot; on her shakedown cruise, using that experience as the basis for his paintings &quot;Score Another for the Subs, In Slumber Deep&quot;, and &quot;The Claustrophobic Confines&quot;.

Himiltrude ({{circa|742}} – c. 780?) was the mother of Charlemagne&#x27;s first-born son Pippin the Hunchback. Some historians have acknowledged her as the wife of Charlemagne, though she is often referred to as a concubine.

==Life==

Little is known about Himiltrude&#x27;s origins. Paul the Deacon calls her a &quot;noble girl&quot;. The appearance of her name in the fraternity books of Alemannian monasteries may suggest an affiliation with the Germanic Alemannian or Alsatian nobility, while other sources make her the daughter of a Burgundian count and a granddaughter of Grimbert I, Count of Paris. It is not possible, however, to extrapolate any political ramifications from Charlemagne&#x27;s relationship with Himiltrude.

Himiltrude probably entered into a relationship with Charlemagne during the lifetime of his father, Pepin the Short. When Charlemagne acceded to the throne in 768, Himiltrude remained unnamed in official sources – contrary to the example set by Charlemagne&#x27;s mother, Bertrada of Laon. Himiltrude bore Charles a son called Pepin. Shortly after Pepin&#x27;s birth, an alliance was formulated between Charlemagne and the King of the Lombards, Desiderius. To seal the alliance, it was agreed that Charlemagne should marry Desiderius&#x27; daughter (called Desiderata by modern scholars).

Himiltrude was dismissed at that time and disappears from historical records. A grave excavated in the monastery of Nivelles was found to contain the corpse of a forty-year-old woman, possibly identifiable with Himiltrude. If so, Himiltrude would appear to have died long after 770, although if and when she retired to Nivelles cannot be deduced. She is named in the confraternity books of Pfäfers, Reichenau, Remiremont and Saint Gall.

Her son Pepin, who had a spinal deformity and was called &quot;the Hunchback&quot;, was eclipsed by Charlemagne&#x27;s sons from his later marriage to Hildegard. Following an attempted rebellion against his father, Pepin was confined to a monastery.

==Marital status==
The nature of Himiltrude&#x27;s relationship to Charlemagne is a matter of dispute. Charlemagne&#x27;s biographer Einhard calls her a &quot;concubine&quot; and Paulus Diaconus speaks of Pepin&#x27;s birth &quot;before legal marriage&quot;. A letter by Pope Stephen III seemingly referring to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and Gerberga), and advising them not to dismiss their wives, has led many historians to believe that Himiltrude and Charlemagne were legally married. however the words employed by the pope could also simply mean that there had only been a promise of marriage and that they were thus only promised to each other. The acts of Adalard of Corbie supports this hypothesis, for his monastic vocation is described as due to the scruple he had regarding Charlemagne&#x27;s dismissal of Princess Desiderata of the Lombards which occurred before any consummation of the marriage and possibly before any religious ceremony (it is unclear whether the marriage ever took place or if Desiderata only received the homage of the nobility in accordance with her planned future position of Queen of the Franks). If Adalard was scandalised by this dismissal, it is highly unlikely he would have been unfazed about Himiltrude&#x27;s dismissal, had she truly been married to Charlemagne.

Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as Pierre Riché, follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, Dieter Hägemann for example, consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was &quot;something more than concubinage, less than marriage&quot; and describe it as a Friedelehe, a supposed form of marriage unrecognized by the Church and easily dissolvable. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.

<text>Fastrada ( – 10 August 794) was queen consort of East Francia by marriage to Charlemagne, as his third (or, in some sources, fourth) wife.

==Life==
Fastrada was born &quot;circa&quot; 765 at Ingelheim, the daughter of the powerful East Frankish Count Rudolph (also called Eadolf), and his wife, Aeda.

Fastrada became the third wife of Charlemagne, marrying him in October 783 at Worms, Germany, a few months after Queen Hildegard&#x27;s death. A probable reason behind the marriage was to solidify a Frankish alliance east of the Rhine when Charles was still fighting the Saxons.

Due to her influence Pepin the Hunchback, son of Charlemagne and Himiltrude, was publicly tonsured after an attempted rebellion against his father. Fastrada soon won a reputation for cruelty, although this is reported by chronicler Einhard in his Vita Karoli Magni, who had not arrived at Charlemagne&#x27;s court while she was still alive. Contemporary sources suggest that she played an active role alongside her husband.
A letter from 785 has survived in which Charlemagne asked Fastrada to come to the Eresburg with the children, although a letter only six years later he inquires about her health because he had not heard from her for a long time and tells her of a victory against the Avars.

In 793, Charlemagne introduced a coin type with Fastrada on it. It is the first known Carolingian coin with a queen named on it. Scholars suggest that Charlemagne was inspired to mint this coin after Offa of Mercia had earlier done so for his wife Cynetryth.

After Christmas 793, Charlemagne and Fastrada went from Wurzburg to Frankfurt (in present-day Germany), where she died on 10 August 794 during the Synod of Frankfurt. Charlemagne is said to have never returned to the place of her death out of mourning for her. He had her buried at St. Alban&#x27;s Abbey, Mainz, before the abbey was finished, and had her silver spindle hung over the altar. Due to Archbishop Richulf&#x27;s influence, she was not buried in the Basilique Saint-Denis, the burial site of almost all the Frankish and French monarchs, nor St. Arnulf&#x27;s Abbey near Metz.

Her tomb was of white marble, adorned with gold and statues. After the destruction of St. Alban&#x27;s Abbey in 1552, her tombstone was transferred to Mainz Cathedral, where it can be seen today in the wall of the southern nave. The inscription reads as follows:

==Children==
*Theodrada (b. 784, d. unknown), abbess of Argenteuil
*Hiltrude (b. 787, d. unknown)

==Legend and popular culture==
The Fastrada legend tells of a magic ring that Fastrada is said to have received from Charlemagne. This ring, the stone of which was a gift from a snake, bound Charlemagne to Fastrada in such a way that he did not want to release her corpse for burial even when it was already beginning to decompose. Eventually Archbishop Turpin of Reims took the ring and threw it in a lake near Aachen.

The Stephen Schwartz musical &quot;Pippin&quot; features a stylized Fastrada, portrayed by Leland Palmer in the original 1972 Broadway cast, by Chita Rivera in the 1981 television film, and by Charlotte d&#x27;Amboise in the 2013 Broadway revival.

<text>Troika is a Russian performance dance based on Russian folk dances. The Russian word &quot;troika&quot; means three-horse team/gear, and the dancers imitate the prancing of horses pulling a sled or a carriage.

The first version was created by choreographer Nadezhda Nadezhdina for her folklore dance troupe Beroyzka in 1948. Since then this dance is included into repertoires of virtually all Russian ethnographic dance ensembles. Initially, it was a dance for a man and two women, but later choreographies with other combinations were created, such as one woman and two men or three women.

==Other cultures==
Similar folk dances are known among other Slavic peoples, e.g., the Polish Trojak.

A Cajun dance of the same name, Troika, exists, similar to the Russian dance. It has been suggested that the Cajun version of the dance originated at the times when Cossacks of the Russian tsar army were stationed in Paris.

There was a German contra dance &quot;triolet&quot; recorded in 1829 for groups of one man and two women.

<doc id="403811" wikidata="Q690707" url="?curid=403811" title="Joe Adonis">
<text>Joseph Anthony Doto (born Giuseppe Antonio Doto, ; November 22, 1902 – November 26, 1971), known as Joe Adonis, was an Italian-American mobster who was an important participant in the formation of the modern Cosa Nostra crime families in New York City and the National Crime Syndicate. Doto became a powerful caporegime in the Luciano crime family.

==Early life==
Adonis was born Giuseppe Antonio Doto on November 22, 1902, in the small town of Montemarano, Province of Avellino, Italy, to Michele Doto and Maria De Vito. He had three brothers, Antonio, Ettore and Genesio Doto.

In 1909, Adonis and his family immigrated to the United States, in New York City. As a young man, Adonis supported himself by stealing and picking pockets. While working on the streets, Adonis became friends with future mob boss Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano and mobster Settimo Accardi, who were involved in illegal gambling. Adonis developed a loyalty to Luciano that lasted for decades.

At the beginning of Prohibition, Luciano, Adonis, Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel started a bootlegging operation in Brooklyn. This operation soon began supplying large amounts of alcohol to the show business community along Broadway in Manhattan. Doto soon assumed the role of a gentleman bootlegger, socializing with the theater elite.

In the early 1920s, Doto started calling himself &quot;Joe Adonis&quot; (Adonis was the Greek god of beauty and desire). It is uncertain as to what inspired his nickname. One story states that Adonis received this nickname from a Ziegfeld Follies chorus girl who was dating him. Another story says that Adonis adopted the name after reading a magazine article on Greek mythology.

Extremely vain, Adonis spent a great deal of time in personal grooming. On one occasion, Lucky Luciano saw Adonis combing his thick, dark hair in front of a mirror and asked him, &quot;Who do you think you are, Rudolph Valentino?&quot; Adonis replied, &quot;For looks, that guy&#x27;s a bum!&quot;. Adonis was a cousin of Luciano crime family capo Alan Bono, who supervised Adonis&#x27;s operations in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.

Adonis married Jean Montemorano, and he had four children; Joseph Michael Doto, Jr., Maria Dolores Olmo, Ann Marie Arietta, and Elizabeth Doto. His son Joseph Doto, Jr., became a made member of the Genovese family and operated criminal rackets in Bergen county, New Jersey.

==Castellammarese War==
In the 1920s, Adonis became an for Frankie Yale, the boss of some rackets in Brooklyn. While working for Yale, Adonis briefly met future Chicago Outfit boss Al Capone, who was also working for Yale. Meanwhile, Luciano became an enforcer for Giuseppe &quot;Joe the Boss&quot; Masseria.

Masseria soon became embroiled in the vicious Castellammarese War with his archrival, Salvatore Maranzano. Maranzano represented the Sicilian clans, most of which came from Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily. As the war progressed, both bosses started recruiting more soldiers. By 1930, Adonis had joined the Masseria faction. As the war turned against Masseria, Luciano secretly contacted Maranzano about switching sides. When Masseria heard about Luciano&#x27;s betrayal, he approached Adonis about killing Luciano. However, Adonis instead warned Luciano about the murder plot.

On April 15, 1931, Adonis allegedly participated in Masseria&#x27;s murder. Luciano had lured Masseria to a meeting at a Coney Island, Brooklyn, restaurant. During the meal, Luciano excused himself to go to the restroom. As soon as Luciano was gone, Adonis, Vito Genovese, Albert Anastasia, and Bugsy Siegel rushed into the dining room and shot Masseria to death. No one was ever indicted in the Masseria murder.

With the death of Masseria, the war ended, and Maranzano was the victor. To avoid any future wars, Maranzano reorganized all the Italian American gangs into the Five Families and anointed himself as &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (&quot;boss of all bosses&quot;). Luciano and his loyalists quickly became dissatisfied with Maranzano&#x27;s power grab. When Luciano discovered that the suspicious Maranzano had ordered his murder, Luciano struck first. On September 10, 1931, several gunmen attacked and killed Maranzano in his Manhattan office.

==Criminal empire==
Adonis and Luciano soon controlled bootlegging in Broadway and Midtown Manhattan. At its height, the operation grossed $12 million in one year and employed 100 workers. Adonis also bought car dealerships in New Jersey. When customers bought cars from his dealerships, the salesmen would intimidate them into buying &quot;protection insurance&quot; for the vehicle. Adonis soon moved into cigarette distribution, buying up vending machines by the hundreds and stocking them with stolen cigarettes. Adonis ran his criminal empire from Joe&#x27;s Italian Kitchen, a restaurant that he owned in Brooklyn. By 1932, Adonis was also a major criminal power in Brooklyn. Despite his wealth, Adonis still participated in jewelry robberies, a throwback to his early criminal career on the streets.

In 1932, Adonis allegedly participated in the kidnapping and brutal beating in Brooklyn of Isidore Juffe and Issac Wapinsky. In 1931, Adonis had lent the two men money for investment and kidnapped them in 1932 after deciding that he should be receiving a higher profit. Two days after the kidnappings, Adonis released Juffe and Wapinsky after receiving a $5,000 ransom payment. A month later, Wapinsky died of internal injuries from being assaulted.

Adonis placed many politicians and high-ranking police officers on his payroll. Adonis used his political influence to assist members of the Luciano crime family, such as Luciano and Genovese, and mob associates such as Meyer Lansky and Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter, the head of Murder, Inc.

As a syndicate board member, Adonis, along with Buchalter, may have been responsible for assigning some murder contracts to Murder Inc.

==Government scrutiny==
In 1936, prosecutors convicted Luciano on pandering charges and sent him to state prison for 30 years. Underboss Vito Genovese remained in charge of the family until he fled to Italy in 1937 to avoid a murder prosecution. Luciano now left Frank Costello, an Adonis ally, in charge of the Luciano family and Adonis in charge of the Syndicate.

On April 27, 1940, Adonis was indicted in Brooklyn on charges of kidnapping, extortion, and assault in the 1932 Juffe/Wapinsky case. However, on February 24, 1941, the prosecutor requested a dismissal for lack of evidence.

In the 1940s, Adonis moved his gambling rackets to New Jersey. New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia&#x27;s campaign against illegal gambling had made it too difficult to do business in New York. Adonis also moved his family to a luxurious house in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Adonis set up a casino in Lodi, New Jersey, and provided limousine service there from New York City. During the same period, Adonis became partners with Meyer Lansky in an illegal casino in Hallandale Beach, Florida.

On February 10, 1946, after being escorted from prison to a ship in Brooklyn harbor, Luciano was deported to Italy. In December 1946, Adonis and Luciano met at the famous Havana Conference of US organized crime bosses in Cuba. It was Luciano&#x27;s goal at the conference to regain his mob influence, using Cuba as a base. Being a loyal supporter, Adonis willingly agreed to turn over his power in the syndicate to Luciano. However, the US government soon discovered Luciano&#x27;s presence in Havana and pressured the Cuban government to expel him. On February 24, 1947, Luciano was placed on a ship by Cuban authorities for deportation back to Italy.

On December 12, 1950, Adonis was summoned before the US Senate Kefauver Commission on organized crime. Adonis repeatedly refused to testify, citing his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Although Adonis escaped contempt charges, he suffered undesirable national exposure as a mobster.

In late May 1951, Adonis and several associates pleaded no contest to charges of operating three gambling rooms in Lodi, New Jersey, and Fort Lee, New Jersey. On May 28, 1951, Adonis was sentenced in Hackensack, New Jersey, to two to three years in state prison.

==Deportation and death==
On August 6, 1953, at a hearing in Adonis&#x27;s prison, the US Department of Justice ordered Adonis&#x27;s deportation to Italy. The government claimed that Adonis was an illegal alien. Adonis fought deportation, claiming that he was a native-born American citizen. On August 9, 1953, Adonis was released from prison in New Jersey.

On January 3, 1956, Adonis voluntarily left New York City on an ocean liner for Naples, Italy. His wife and children stayed behind in New Jersey.

Once in Italy, Adonis moved into a luxurious apartment in the center of Milan. Adonis may have met with Luciano in Naples, but there is no proof of it. Over time, the financially struggling Luciano grew angry at the wealthy Adonis for not helping him. On January 26, 1962, Luciano died of a heart attack in Naples at age 64. Adonis attended the funeral service in Naples, bringing a huge floral wreath with the words, &quot;So Long, Pal&quot;.

In June 1971, the Italian government forced Adonis to leave his Milan residence and move to Serra de&#x27; Conti, a small town near the Adriatic Sea. Adonis was one of 115 suspected mobsters relocated to Serra de&#x27; Conti after the assassination in May of Pietro Scaglione, the public prosecutor of Palermo, Sicily. In late November 1971, Italian police forces transported Adonis to a small hillside shack near Ancona, Italy, for interrogation. During the lengthy questioning and some abusive treatment, Adonis suffered a heart attack. He was taken to a regional hospital in Ancona, where he died several days later on November 26, 1971.

===Burial===
The U.S. government allowed Adonis&#x27;s family to bring his body back to the United States for burial. Adonis&#x27; funeral Mass was held at the Church of the Epiphany in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, attended only by his immediate family. He is buried in Madonna Cemetery in Fort Lee, New Jersey under his family name of Joseph Antonio Doto.

<text>Luitgard (born around 776, died 4 June 800) was the last wife of Charlemagne.

Luitgard was the daughter of Luitfrid II of Sundgau, an Alamannian count, and Hiltrude of Wormsgau. She married Charlemagne in 794, when he was around 50 years old. 

Little is known of her, except that the king found in her a calm and virtuous woman; at court, she was even appreciated by his children. Alcuin praises Luitgarde&#x27;s love of letters: of her he says, “The queen loves to converse with learned and learned men; after his devotional exercises, it is his dearest pastime. She is full of complaisance for the king, pious, blameless and worthy of all the love of such a husband.&quot; She also accompanied Charlemagne on the great hunt each year. 

Luitgard died of an unknown illness on 4 June 800 at the monastery of Saint-Martin de Tours,
during a tour with Charlemagne in Neustria, preceding his trip to Rome where, just over six months later, he was crowned &quot;Imperator Romanorum&quot; (&quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;). She was buried there, and although the location of her tomb is not precisely known, reportedly it is under the Charlemagne Tower associated with Basilica of Saint Martin, Tours. She and Charlemagne had no children, and he did not remarry again.

According to 15th century chronicles from Oxford University, Luitgard had a sister, Redburga/Redburh, who met Ecgberht, later to be King of Wessex, while he was exiled in West Francia by Beorhtric of Wessex and Offa of Mercia; the two later married.

<text>The Congregational Holiness Church is a Holiness Pentecostal Christian denomination that was formed in 1921.

==History==
The &quot;Congregational Holiness Church&quot; shares the early history of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church, from which it withdrew. In 1920 a schism came into the &quot;Pentecostal Holiness Church&quot; over the relation of divine healing and the use of medicine. Some pastors believed Christians had the right to use medicine and doctors, while the majority of the church believed in trusting God for healing without the use of medicine and doctors. The minority withdrew and formed the &quot;Congregational Holiness Church&quot;. Led by Reverends Watson Sorrow and Hugh Bowling, a delegation from 12 churches met on January 29, 1921 at the church in High Shoals, Georgia to organize. The church was chartered in 1925 as the &quot;Southeastern Association of the Congregational Holiness Church&quot; and changed in 1965 to the &quot;Congregational Holiness Church, Inc.&quot;.

The early leaders of the CHC attempted to democratize church government, preferring congregational rule over the Pentecostal Holiness Church&#x27;s episcopal polity. In its beginning, the church had no officially elected leaders, and a General Conference was held every two years. In 1935, the structure of the denomination was changed. The church was divided into three districts, and in 1938 the office of General Superintendent was added. Foreign mission work began in the early 1950s.

===Recent history===
Offices are located in Griffin, Georgia. In addition to the United States, the &quot;Congregational Holiness Church&quot; has congregations in 34 countries including, but not limited to the following continents: Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. The Church now has eight districts: North Alabama, South Alabama, East Carolina, West Carolina, Central Georgia, North Georgia, Florida, Virginia, and a Hispanic Conference. USA Membership in 2013 was an estimated 29,000 in 275 churches. Partnership with the larger Pentecostal and evangelical communities is maintained through membership in the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America, the National Association of Evangelicals, and the Pentecostal World Fellowship.

==Beliefs==
Those who organized the new church believed that, although divine healing was a part of Christ&#x27;s atonement, God had given the gift of medicine to mankind as well. Otherwise, the faith and practice of the &quot;Congregational Holiness Church&quot; is quite similar to the parent body. Doctrine includes belief in the Trinity; the inspiration of the Scriptures; the Baptism of the Holy Ghost with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues; the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ; the death, burial and resurrection of Christ; and His imminent, personal, premillennial second coming. They hold three church ordinances, water baptism, the Lord&#x27;s supper, and feet washing, as well as the operation of nine gifts of the Spirit.

=== Articles of faith ===

*We require all our ministers to speak the same thing, and that there be no division among us in doctrine concerning our Articles of Faith. I Corinthians 1:10.

==Structure==
The CHC’s form of government is congregational. The highest governing body is the General Conference, which meets every four years. The General Conference elects the General Superintendent, which along with two Assistant General Superintendents, General Secretary, General Treasurer, and World Missions Superintendent. The following full-time officers, General Superintendent, World Missions Superintendent, and the appointed Mission USA Administrator, manage the day-to-day operations of the church. The nine districts elect five member presbyteries. The presbyters along with the general church officers form the General Committee. This committee handles the major business of the church between General Conferences.

<doc id="403829" wikidata="Q468810" url="?curid=403829" title="Túpac Katari">
<text>Túpac Katari or Catari (also Túpaj Katari) ( – November 13, 1781), born Julián Apasa Nina, was the indigenous Aymara leader of a major insurrection in colonial-era Upper Peru (now Bolivia), laying siege to La Paz for six months. His wife Bartolina Sisa and his sister Gregoria Apaza participated in the rebellion by his side. The rebellion was ultimately put down by Spanish loyalists and Katari was executed by quartering.

==Biography==

Katari was born Julián Apasa in the jurisdiction of Sicasica and later moved to the nearby town of Ayoayo. He was born a peasant and worked as a trader of coca and baize.

A member of the Aymara, Apasa took the name &quot;Tupac Katari&quot; to honor two earlier rebel leaders: Tomás Katari, and Túpac Amaru, executed by the Spanish in 1572. Katari&#x27;s uprising was simultaneous with the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II, whose cacique leader claimed to be a descendant of the earlier Túpac Amaru. Túpac Katari had no traditional claim to leadership similar to that of Túpac Amaru II, which may well have prompted Katari to associate himself with earlier leaders. Katari claimed authority from Túpac Amaru and proclaimed himself viceroy of the region. (&quot;Katari&quot; means &quot;serpent, large snake&quot; in Aymara; &quot;Amaru&quot; means the same in Quechua, the language of Tupac Amaru. &quot;Tupac&quot; means &quot;brilliant, resplendent&quot; in both languages.)

He raised an army of some 40,000 and laid siege to the city of La Paz in 1781. Katari and his wife Bartolina Sisa set up court in El Alto and maintained the siege from March to June and from August to October. Sisa was a commander of the siege, and played the crucial role following Katari&#x27;s capture in April. The siege was broken by the Spanish colonial troops who advanced from Lima and Buenos Aires. During the siege, 20,000 people died.

Katari laid siege again later in the year, this time joined by Andrés Túpac Amaru, nephew of Túpac Amaru II, but Katari lacked adequate forces to be successful.

Katari had a reputation as a fierce and often violent leader. Other leaders in the rebel camps testified to his &quot;homicides and enormous violence&quot;; he was known not only for violence toward his enemies but also those who fought on his side, executing people for having &quot;spoken against him, stolen his property, acted in an overweening fashion, challenged his authority, or humiliated him&quot;.

On his death on November 15, 1781, Katari&#x27;s final words were, according to oral tradition, &quot;.&quot; This is translated from Aymara as &quot;I die but will return tomorrow as thousand thousands&quot;.

==Rebellion==

As part of the uprising, Túpac Katari formed an army of forty thousand men and surrounded twice for a time, in 1781 the Spanish colonial city of La Paz. The two attempts, however, ended in failure due to political and military maneuvers by the Spanish, as well as alliances with indigenous leaders against Túpac Katari. Eventually all the leaders of the rebellion were arrested and executed, including Túpac Katari&#x27;s wife, Bartolina Sisa, and his sister, Gregoria Apaza.

This indigenous uprising at the end of the 18th century was the largest geographically and with the most support. It took the affected viceroyalties two years to suffocate it.

The rebels besieged the city of La Paz from March 13, 1781, for one hundred and nine days without success, due to resistance and the support of troops sent from Buenos Aires. In this context, Viceroy Agustín de Jáuregui took advantage of the low morale of the rebels to offer amnesty to those who surrendered, which gave many fruits, including some leaders of the movement. Túpac Katari, who had not accepted the amnesty and went to Achacachi to reorganize his dispersed forces, was betrayed by some of his followers and was captured by the Spanish on the night of November 9, 1781.

During the second siege, Andrés Túpac Amaru, a nephew of Túpac Amaru II and romantically linked to Gregoria Apaza, Túpac Katari&#x27;s younger sister, joined the Tupac Katari rebels.

As a moral reward for the efforts and sacrifices that the Spanish of the city of La Paz had to endure, through the royal decree of May 20, 1784, the city of La Paz was awarded the title of &quot;noble, courageous and faithful&quot; (faithful to the king of Spain, it is understood).

==Legacy==

For his effort, his betrayal, defeat, torture and brutal execution, Túpac Katari is remembered as a hero by modern indigenous movements in Bolivia, who call their political philosophy Katarismo. A Bolivian guerrilla group, the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army, also bears his name.

In Bolivia, on July 15, 2005, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze declared (through Law No. 3102) &quot;National Aymara Hero and Heroine to Julián Apaza and Bartolina Sisa.&quot;

In Argentina, as part of the Bicentennial celebrations, a Gallery of South American Patriots was inaugurated on May 25, 2010, in which Bolivia is represented by portraits of Túpac Katari, Pedro Domingo Murillo and Bartolina Sisa. The pictorial sample is located in the so-called &quot;Hall of the Bicentennial Heroes&quot;, in the Casa Rosada.

The first Bolivian telecommunications satellite, Túpac Katari 1, whose purpose is to support educational initiatives and maintain state security, bears his name.

Since 2019, his appearance has been incorporated into the new design of the 200 Bolivian banknote.

<doc id="403852" wikidata="Q4693785" url="?curid=403852" title="Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora">
<text>The Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora is a set of environmental protection measures which were accepted at the third Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Brussels in 1964. The Agreed Measures were formally in force as part of the Antarctic Treaty System from 1982 to 2011, when they were withdrawn as the principles were now entirely superseded by later agreements such as the 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The Agreed Measures were adopted in order to further international collaboration within the administration of the Antarctic Treaty System and promote the protection of natural Antarctic ecological systems while enabling scientific study and exploration.

The Agreed Measures were the first attempts under the Treaty to prioritise wildlife conservation and environmental protection. This was needed due to increasing human interest in exploration, science, and fishing, which had put pressure on natural flora and fauna. They proved successful, and led the way for more stringent environmental protection in future.

== History ==
Antarctic interests in the late 1940s were increasing, with nations fighting over territory in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Fear of open conflict from these nations, as well as fear of Antarctica becoming involved in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, led to the first discussions of Antarctic diplomacy and treaties. This led to the negotiations of the Antarctic Treaty in 1959 in which the International Geophysical Year Antarctic Program met to discuss scientific papers from 12 participating nations, regarding Antarctic science and research. The 12 nations in attendance were also members of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) which was founded one year prior in 1958. SCAR was formulated as an international association of biologists and other scientists interested in Antarctic research, and included Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States, and USSR. The formation of SCAR and the Antarctic Treaty enabled scientists to advocate for conservation efforts and policy in Antarctica, leading to the first discussions of establishing the Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.

The International Geophysical Year Antarctic Program was the beginning of concerns for Antarctic wildlife, as the geophysical scientists&#x27; efforts to explore Antarctica proved to be inadvertently harming Antarctic flora and fauna. Biologists were calling for awareness that Antarctica was not a lifeless tundra, but in fact had wildlife that was extremely vulnerable to human interference. SCAR secretary Gordon Robin published a paper for fellow scientist Robert Carrick in the &quot;SCAR&quot; &quot;Bulletin&quot; to bring further awareness to the requirement of conservation in Antarctica. Carrick, along with other prominent scientists, William J. L. Sladen, Robert Falla, Carl Eklund, Jean Prevost and Robert Cushman Murphy to name a few, were among the loudest contributors to SCAR&#x27;s position of conservation. 

As these scientists had all specialised in the area of birds, their first action towards Antarctic conservation occurred at the 1960 International Council for Bird Preservation in which they called specifically for protection of Antarctic birds. After this, SCAR continued to have a large voice in advocating Antarctic conservation, with Robert Carrick speaking at the Fourth SCAR meeting in 1960 to address specific reasons why conservation was necessary as well as providing recommendations for legislation. Following these meetings, SCAR supplied the parties of the Antarctic Treaty with their report, and it was from there that the first talks of the Agreed Measures began amongst Antarctic Treaty System members.

== Negotiations ==

In January 1960, the U.S. representative for the Antarctic Treaty, Paul Daniels, asked that conservation be formally discussed at the first Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. After this, US participation declined, and the British government was the only strong advocate for conservation. Brian Roberts from the Foreign Office began calling for a separate Convention for Antarctic conservation. At the first Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting at Canberra in 1961, parties agreed that some form of conservation effort was required, and implemented Recommendation I-VIII; a very broad set of interim guidelines which incorporated much of the SCAR report. Following this meeting, Roberts continued pushing for a formal agreement and drafted a full Convention to present to the other parties. On 6 June 1963 all the parties convened to discuss three position papers for conservation: the British draft, and the responses to said draft by Chile and the Soviet Union. In September 1963, the US representatives released their own draft titled the &quot;Agreed Measures&quot; rather than a Convention, and incorporated the preamble from the Soviets and much of the British draft with small changes in specific terminology. The US argued that a Measures would be better than a separate Convention as the Measures would fall under the authority of the Antarctic Treaty and share the same administrations.

At the third Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting at Brussels in June 1964, the Agreed Measures were passed as Recommendation VIII. Despite this, it took 18 years before they were effective in 1982 after Japan was the final country to sign them. The 12 countries required to sign for the measures to be effective, were the same 12 who had formulated SCAR; Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States, and the Soviet Union. During the 18 years interim, parties behaved as though the measures were in force, with all of Antarctica being considered a &quot;Special Conservation Area&quot;.

== Summary of the Agreed Measures ==
The consisted of fourteen articles, of which four were simply formalities. The Measures applied to land areas south of latitude 60°S which fell under the jurisdiction of the Antarctic Treaty. In it was explicitly stated that this was with the exception of high seas areas which remain under international law. The first article also included provisions to ensure all Annexes to the were considered a part of the measures themselves. A participating government could only be exempt from these Measures in &quot;extreme circumstances&quot;, such as involving the potential loss of human life or an event which may jeopardise the welfare of large vessels such as ships and aircraft. The Agreed Measures strictly prohibited attempted killing, harming, or capturing of native mammals or birds without permit in , and in it prohibited driving of vehicles and collecting native flora without permit. In both cases, a permit would only be supplied with &quot;compelling scientific purpose&quot; and assurance that ecology would not be endangered by these actions. The permits for these activities had specific terms and were only provided to a participating government in the case of limited food quantities for humans or dogs, for scientific research or to provide specimens for education. also instructed that permits had to be restricted in number by participating governments to ensure that native species were not killed more than can be compensated naturally in the year. 

The Agreed Measures also set out to prevent harmful interference of native conditions in , and provided a detailed list of activities deemed harmful. These activities included eliciting loud sounds near wildlife, flying aircraft too close to wildlife, allowing dogs to run free, and excessive human disturbance during breeding periods. also stated that participating governments must take appropriate actions to prevent pollution of waters. Most notably, the Agreed Measures designated all applied areas as &quot;Specially Protected Areas&quot; in , to emphasise the vulnerability of native Antarctic flora and fauna. In addition, the introduction of non-indigenous flora and fauna was prohibited in unless supported by a permit and was a species approved by . This did not include flora and fauna imported for the use of food, as long as it did not threaten Antarctic ecosystems. This section also highlighted the role of each participating government in preventing introduction of disease, with citing a list of precautions to prevent this. The Agreed Measures also established a framework for participating governments to communicate and share data on native Antarctic bird and mammal species in . This included information on how many numbers of each species had been killed or captured annually under a permit for use as food, or scientific study. This communication ensured transparency and allowed participating governments to determine the level of protection each native species required to protect and preserve Antarctic flora and fauna.

== Ratification ==
The convention was ratified both by members whose ratification was required for entry into force as by others. A list is shown: 
== Other Agreements ==

=== Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals ===
The Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, only covered land areas south of latitude 60°S, and thus there was no measure in place for protection on the sea or floating ice. This was despite the efforts of Robert Carrick and the Australian party, who advocated strongly for this to be included in the Agreed Measures, to protect animals who spend most of their lives on pack ice or in the seas surrounding Antarctica. This issue was rectified by the signing of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals in 1972, and was the first treaty in the wake of the Agreed Measures.

=== Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ===
In 1975 at the Eighth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, they adopted Recommendation VIII-10 to protect marine life, which were excluded from the scope of the Agreed Measures. This issue had become increasingly urgent due to extensive fishing practices and overfishing of Antarctic krill which had become popular in the late 1960s to mid-1970s. In 1978 they held a Conference on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources which resulted in the signing of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in 1980. This was the world&#x27;s first conservation agreement which protected the ecosystem (marine life) rather than an individual species such as seals.

=== Bilateral Treaties ===
Many updated measures were put in to place addressing similar issues of the Agreed Measures at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings such as Article 3.2 and The Annex II to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The Protocol, otherwise known as the &quot;Madrid Protocol&quot; was set into effect in 1998, and prohibited mining or mineral resource activity in Antarctica. Article 3.2 is similar to the Agreed Measures as it prevents harm to natural Antarctic wildlife. Annex II also relates to the Agreed Measures by banning harmful interference and introduction of parasites or foreign species without permit as well as defining Specially Protected Areas and Species. Annex V of the Environmental Protocol followed that of the Agreed Measures, by designating &quot;Specially Protected Areas&quot; in Antarctica, and was adopted separately in 1991 and in force from 2002 onwards. In contrast to the Agreed Measures, Annex V also designated marine areas to be included within the scope of &quot;Antarctic Specially Protected Areas&quot;. In fact, Annex V added several different layers of protection for Antarctic land areas, by introducing &quot;Antarctic Specially Protected Areas&quot;, &quot;Antarctic Specially Managed Areas&quot; and &quot;Historic Sites and Monuments&quot;. As with the Agreed Measures, &quot;Antarctic Specially Protected Areas&quot;, was defined by Annex V of the Environmental Protocol as an area protected to maintain ecological, scientific, historic and aesthetic features and requires a permit to enter. &quot;Antarctic Specially Managed Area&quot; was defined as an area in which activities may be conducted and does not require a permit to enter, however parties must continue to minimise their ecological impact and avoid conflicts between participating governments. Lastly, Antarctic &quot;Historic Sites and Monuments&quot; were defined as areas of significant historic relevance and can be proposed by any participating government. 

The Agreed Measures also focused significantly on prohibiting harmful human interference, and since then several other treaties were adopted to manage human disturbance. This includes the 1994 Recommendation XVIII-1: Guidance for Visitors to the Antarctic as well as the 2004 Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft Near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica. Recommendation XVIII-1 provided the main regulations for tourists and expeditions to the Antarctic and required report submissions for their visits. The Recommendation explicitly stated prohibited activities for tourists in order to prevent harmful interference with wildlife, as well as guidelines for respecting protected areas, and scientific research facilities and equipment. The guidelines also included provisions to prevent human waste, pollution and defacement of property including engraving or painting on natural rocks. The Guidelines for the Operation of Aircraft Near Concentrations of Birds in Antarctica followed the legislation provided by the Agreed Measures in terms of prohibiting aircraft near natural wildlife to prevent disruption. The Guidelines were adopted by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties in 2004, and listed specific regulations to protect wildlife by discouraging aircraft from flying below above ground level, landing within of bird colonies, hovering or making repeated passes over wildlife and flying less than from the coastline.

<doc id="403860" wikidata="Q7487247" url="?curid=403860" title="Shall the Dust Praise Thee?">
<text>&quot;Shall the Dust Praise Thee?&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Damon Knight. It was first published in the anthology &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; (1967). His agent refused to publish it and suggested the &quot;Atheist Journal&quot; in Moscow might buy it, but no one else would. The title comes from Psalm 30:9 in the Bible.

In the story, God arrives on planet Earth for Judgement Day, but finds out that human extinction has already taken place and that there is no one left to judge. His angels inform him that humanity wiped itself out in nuclear warfare. There is one last human message left for the deity, asking him where he was. There is no one left to listen to the answer. 

==Summary==
God arrives on Earth, ready to inflict the Day of Wrath on humankind, but finds that all life has already disappeared. The angels tell God that there has been a great war between England, Russia, China, and America which has wiped out all life on earth, and that the true end of days had already occurred through nuclear warfare. No living creatures, no water, no grass, nothing but dust and brittle stone remain on the world. All that remains of humanity is the phrase left by the last humans as a message to God, saying, &quot;WE WERE HERE. WHERE WERE YOU?&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Blueback&quot; (SS-581) is a that served in the United States Navy from 1959 to 1990, and subsequently was made into an exhibit at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. She was the second Navy submarine to bear the name.

&quot;Blueback&quot; was laid down by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation of Pascagoula, Mississippi on 15 April 1957. She was launched on 16 May 1959 sponsored by Virginia McManes, wife of Rear Admiral Kenmore M. McManes, and commissioned on 15 October 1959, Lieutenant Commander Robert H. Gautier in command. She was the last non-nuclear submarine to join the United States Navy and was the final conventionally powered combat capable submarine to be decommissioned, which left the United States Navy with a fully nuclear submarine fleet, with the exception of the research submarine which served until 2007.

== Origin of the name ==
Sources differ on the origin of &quot;Blueback&quot;″s name. The &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot; entry for &quot;Blueback&quot; states that she is named after a 

Other sources state that she is named after the 

== Service ==

=== 1960s ===

After fitting out, &quot;Blueback&quot; got underway in January 1960 for a series of acceptance trials in the Gulf of Mexico. She completed that mission and departed Pascagoula on 11 June, bound for the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal on 7 July and continued on to her home port, Naval Station San Diego. There she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 3 (SUBRON 3), Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. &quot;Blueback&quot; then carried out torpedo tube acceptance trials at Keyport, Washington, and underwent a post-shakedown availability at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. On 23 November 1960, the submarine was accepted for service.

Type training in the San Diego area kept her busy into February 1961. On 11 February, she commenced a two-week availability at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. &quot;Blueback&quot; got underway on 28 March for a deployment to the western Pacific during which she participated in 7th Fleet operations and exercises. The submarine left Yokosuka, Japan, on 3 September and sailed submerged to San Diego, arriving there on 25 September.

After leave and upkeep, &quot;Blueback&quot; began type training exercises out of San Diego on 14 October. Four days later, she participated in a fleet exercise off the southern California coast conducted under the auspices of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). During the next eight months, the submarine took part in several fleet exercises and visited San Francisco, California, and Seattle, Washington. In July 1962, &quot;Blueback&quot; entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for her first major overhaul.

Upon completion of the overhaul in January 1963, the submarine made port calls at Seattle and at Vancouver, British Columbia. She then left the west coast and proceeded to her new home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. There, the submarine was assigned to Submarine Division 13 (SUBDIV 13). &quot;Blueback&quot; was involved in local operations from February to early April. On 11 April, the submarine got underway for operations in WestPac. &quot;Blueback&quot; sailed to Australia to participate in the annual celebration of the anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea and visited Brisbane, Melbourne, and Perth. She then continued on to Subic Bay in the Philippines for operations with the 7th Fleet. While on her deployment, &quot;Blueback&quot; also called at Naha, Okinawa; and at Sasebo, Kobe, and Yokosuka, Japan, before returning to Pearl Harbor on 26 October.

&quot;Blueback&quot; resumed her former routine in Hawaiian waters and continued local operations into 1964. In March, she suffered damage when a crane toppled over onto her while changing her propeller, necessitating a drydocking for repairs. In the fall and early winter, the submarine made two trips to the vicinity of Wake Island to take part in the evaluations of the SUBROC missile system and s. In each test, &quot;Blueback&quot; served as a target ship.

On 17 February 1965, &quot;Blueback&quot; began her second deployment to the Far East. During the cruise, she made port calls at Naha, Hong Kong, Subic Bay, and Yokosuka, and also was involved in supporting American operations in Vietnam. She returned to Pearl Harbor in June, where she carried out local operations until 7 September. She got underway for Bremerton, Washington, on that day and entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard 18 days later for overhaul.

The yard work ended on 26 September 1966, and the submarine commenced sound trials and weapons tests in Puget Sound. She also provided services for a research and development project conducted near Nanoose, Canada. After a four-day visit to Vancouver, she set sail for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived early in November and began refresher training.

Following three months of preparations and training, &quot;Blueback&quot; embarked on another tour of duty in the western Pacific on 17 February 1967. During the seven-month assignment, she punctuated periods at sea training and supporting the American efforts in the Vietnam War with port calls at Hong Kong and in Japan at Yokosuka and Sasebo. The submarine returned to Oahu early that fall, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 20 September. After a month of leave and upkeep, she resumed operations in Hawaiian waters. On 19 December, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability.

In mid-January 1968, the submarine helped prospective commanding officers to prepare for their new assignments at the Pacific Fleet Submarine Force&#x27;s school. She then acted as a target for several surface ships and aircraft to practice ASW techniques, and engaged in type training and weapons exercises. On 8 July, she began a five-month deployment to the Far East which, in addition to two special operations, also included much time spent in upkeep at Yokosuka. &quot;Blueback&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 December.

=== 1970s ===

Very early in 1969, she voyaged to Bremerton, and entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 17 January for an overhaul. During her subsequent sea trials and training, the submarine visited Nanaimo, British Columbia, and Port Angeles, Washington, before returning to Hawaii early in December. After intensive training during the first three months of 1970, &quot;Blueback&quot; set sail on her fifth deployment to the western Pacific on 10 April. She carried out lengthy special operations; made brief visits to Yokosuka, Hong Kong, and Guam; and spent time in the Vietnam war zone. The warship ended the cruise at Pearl Harbor on 1 October and began a period of local operations and upkeep. On 12 February 1971, she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a restricted availability which concluded in late March with trials at sea. Early in April, she took part in SUBASWEX 1-71 in the Pearl Harbor area. After conducting torpedo firing exercises, &quot;Blueback&quot; entered upkeep at Pearl Harbor.

She began another Far eastern assignment on 25 June and arrived at Yokosuka on 12 July for a week of upkeep before beginning a month of operational training at sea. The submarine next visited Sasebo for 10 days and then continued on to Hong Kong for a liberty period. &quot;Blueback&quot; traveled south to the Vietnam war zone to render training services to destroyer units of the 7th Fleet and then returned to Japan for upkeep at Yokosuka. On 11 October, the submarine got underway for more training at sea. She paused once again at Yokosuka before sailing for Hawaii on 29 November. She arrived back in her home port on 14 December.

Local operations occupied her during the first 10 weeks of 1972; then, the submarine began a lengthy overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 29 March. Nearly a year later early in March 1973, she finished the yard work, commenced local operations and trained in preparation for deployment. She sailed for the Orient on 8 August and, while there, participated in several operations with other American warships as well as with naval forces from Korea and Taiwan. Among the ports she visited were Yokosuka and Sasebo, Japan; Chinhae and Pusan, Korea; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; Hong Kong; and Subic Bay in the Philippines. On 5 January 1974, &quot;Blueback&quot; left Subic Bay and visited Keelung, Taiwan, for two days before heading back to Hawaii.

The submarine arrived in Pearl Harbor on 31 January 1974 and commenced a leave and upkeep period. During the remainder of the year, &quot;Blueback&quot; took part in numerous training operations and exercises. She provided services to surface ships and aircraft, conducted torpedo firing drills, and did another tour preparing prospective commanding officers for the new jobs.

During the first two months of 1975, the submarine continued local operations. In March, she participated in Exercise &quot;RIMPAC 75&quot;, which included ships from the navies of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Upon completion of this operation, &quot;Blueback&quot; commenced a restricted availability. Early in June, she resumed local operations including a series of torpedo firing tests, type training, and services to surface and air units. The warship closed out the year in upkeep at Pearl Harbor.

She held sea trials and weapons exercises in January 1976 and began another long overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in February. She did not complete those repairs until 1 December. &quot;Blueback&quot; commenced refresher training 12 days later. In February 1977, she took part in Exercise &quot;RIMPAC 77&quot;, then conducted torpedo trials. After a brief period of upkeep, the submarine departed Pearl Harbor on 28 March and proceeded to her new home port, San Diego, arriving there on 8 April. After an inspection and services to aircraft, she set out for San Francisco on 27 May, made a brief visit, and returned to San Diego on 1 June to prepare for duty overseas. On 21 June, the submarine got underway for Santa Marta, Colombia. Upon arriving there on 7 August, she joined Task Force 138 to participate in UNITAS XVIII. The task force also included , , and . During the deployment, &quot;Blueback&quot; visited ports in Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. She departed Talcahuano, Chile, on 27 September and headed back to San Diego. She stopped at Rodman in the Panama Canal Zone, and made a four-day liberty call at Acapulco, Mexico, before reaching San Diego on 11 November.

The submarine began 1978 in upkeep. She got underway on 13 February for a short visit to San Francisco, returned to San Diego on the 21st, and provided services to ships and aircraft in the San Diego area. From 23 April to 23 May, she underwent a battery replacement in preparation for an upcoming deployment. The ship sailed on 30 May for Portland, Oregon, where she represented the Submarine Force at that city&#x27;s Rose Festival. She then continued north along the coast to conduct an exercise with Canadian forces off Esquimalt, British Columbia. Following this operation, &quot;Blueback&quot; arrived at Seattle on 23 June for a two-day liberty call before returning to San Diego.

The submarine began a restricted availability on 17 July and, on 8 August, began final preparations for deployment. On 11 September, she got underway for her eighth western Pacific cruise. She touched at Pearl Harbor on the 22nd, but soon pressed on for Japan, and arrived at Yokosuka on 7 October. She next made a run to Chinhae, Korea, for two weeks of joint special warfare and ASW exercises with units of the South Korean Navy. On 5 November, &quot;Blueback&quot; arrived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to participate in ASW exercises with the Taiwanese Navy. From 14 to 24 November, she took part in a 7th Fleet exercise and then proceeded to Sasebo for a leave and upkeep period. &quot;Blueback&quot; then spent five days at Hong Kong from 6 to 11 December before heading on to Subic Bay where she arrived on 13 December to close out the year in upkeep.

&quot;Blueback&quot; got underway on 5 January 1979 to provide target services for ships of the 7th Fleet undergoing ASW training. She then took part in special warfare exercises with Army Special Forces troops. On 22 January, the submarine arrived at Subic Bay for upkeep. Nine days later, she set out on a submerged voyage back to the United States and reached San Diego on 1 March.

After a few weeks of leave and upkeep, the submarine took up local operations again and continued so engaged until beginning a tender availability on 14 May. She resumed local operations again on 12 June. &quot;Blueback&quot; sailed north on 18 August to visit Astoria, Oregon, and Seattle, Wash., returning to her home port early in September. Following a minelaying exercise off the southern California coast between 17 and 20 September, the submarine entered drydock on 1 October. She began sea trials on 27 November and then provided ASW services before closing the year in a holiday leave and upkeep status.

=== 1980s ===

&quot;Blueback&quot; spent the first three and a half months of 1980 in local operations and exercises in preparation for overseas movement. &quot;Blueback&quot; departed San Diego on 15 April and completed her submerged transit of the Pacific at Okinawa on 11 May. The submarine then took part in ASW exercises in the Philippine Sea. She began upkeep at Yokosuka on 18 May and then got underway for special operations. &quot;Blueback&quot; began the month of June in upkeep at Sasebo but soon returned to sea to participate in joint exercises with South Korean forces. After another period of upkeep and liberty at Sasebo, she got underway on the 22nd for ASW operations in cooperation with the Japanese submarine &quot;Isoshio&quot;. At the conclusion of the exercise, &quot;Blueback&quot; visited Beppu, Japan, before heading for Subic Bay, where she arrived on 8 July. After upkeep, the submarine participated in an ASW exercise in the South China Sea with several ships of the 7th Fleet.

On 22 July, &quot;Blueback&quot; began a six-day journey to Chinhae to take part in extensive exercises with the South Korean Navy. Early in August, the submarine visited Sasebo and Subic Bay. She conducted special warfare operations from 18 to 21 August and then entered port at San Fernando on northern Luzon. She got underway on 25 August for ASW operations with ships of the Royal Navy. After a final call at Subic Bay, the submarine began her voyage back to home port on 15 September. She entered San Diego on 15 October and began post-deployment leave and upkeep. Then came several days of type training in nearby waters followed by holiday leave and upkeep to close out the year.

:&quot;[1980-1990]&quot;

== Decommissioning and status ==

&quot;Blueback&quot; was decommissioned on 1 October 1990 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet in Bremerton, Washington. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 October 1990. With her removal from service, the last warship that was a diesel-electric submarine of the United States Navy had left the fleet, leaving the research submarine as the last diesel submarine of the US fleet.

In February 1994 the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) towed &quot;Blueback&quot; to Portland, Oregon, where she now rests as an interactive part of the museum and a memorial. Her propeller was removed and installed outside the museum as a National Submarine Memorial. OMSI offers short guided tours of the submarine several times a day and three-hour technical tours twice a month. The vessel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in September 2008.

The radio room has been restored by the USS &quot;Blueback&quot; Radio Club with both historic military radios and operational modern amateur radio gear which use the original military HF and VHF antennas. The submarine&#x27;s radio call sign is now W7SUB.

== Honors and awards ==
* Vietnam Service Medal with two campaign stars for Vietnam War service

== Popular culture ==

&quot;Blueback&quot; appeared in the episode &quot;Samurai&quot; of the 1970s television series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

&quot;Blueback&quot; appeared in the 1990 movie &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, although she did not perform the famous stunt of an emergency main ballast tank blow during an emergency surfacing procedure seen in the film. A film crew was allowed on board to film a torpedo room scene and some of her crew were paid $50 (USD) each to have their hair cut and to put on Soviet Navy uniforms for the scene, but the scene was not included in the film.

&quot;Blueback&quot; and the OMSI (standing in for the fictional Boston Science Museum) appeared in &quot;The Librarians&quot; season 3 premiere episode &quot;...and the Rise of Chaos.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Blueback&quot; (SS-326), a in commission from 1944 to 1948, was the first submarine of the United States Navy to be named for the blueback salmon, also known as the sockeye salmon. She completed three war patrols in the South China Sea and Java Sea during World War II. She sank a 300-displacement ton submarine chaser as well as eight smaller vessels.

After her U.S. Navy service, the submarine was transferred to Turkey, and was in commission in the Turkish Naval Forces from 1948 to 1973 as TCG &quot;İkinci Inönü&quot; (D-12) (also written TCG &quot;2. Inönü&quot; (D-2)), later renumbered S-18 and S 331.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Blueback&quot;″s keel was laid down on 29 July 1943 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 7 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. William Brent Young, wife of Rear Admiral William Brent Young, and commissioned on 28 August 1944.

== Service history ==
===United States Navy===
====World War II====
=====August–December 1944=====

Following shakedown training off New London, Connecticut, and Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Blueback&quot; got underway on 2 October 1944 for Key West, Florida. Upon her arrival there, she began making sound training runs for ships undergoing antisubmarine warfare training at the Fleet Sound School. She departed Key West for the Panama Canal Zone on 20 October 1944, transited the Panama Canal on 24 October, and engaged in further training at Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone before continuing on to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she arrived on 22 November 1944. She then underwent repairs and another two weeks of training in the waters of the Hawaiian Islands.

=====First war patrol=====

On 16 December 1944, &quot;Blueback&quot; departed Pearl Harbor to commence her first war patrol in company with the submarine . The submarine joined them at sea on 23 December. The three submarines formed a coordinated attack group which was patrolling north of Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 27 December 1944 when a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber crashed into the sea a few thousand yards [meters] away from the American submarines, and &quot;Blueback&quot; rescued four of the bomber&#x27;s crewmen. She put in at Saipan that same afternoon to drop them off and then resumed her patrol on 29 December 1944. On 2 January 1945, she reached the area off Tori-shima in the Izu Islands, where she patrolled for the next 24 days. She transmitted regular weather reports as part of the lengthy preparations for U.S. invasion of Okinawa (scheduled to begin on 1 April 1945), occasionally dived to avoid Japanese planes, and searched for Japanese ships. On 26 January 1945, she left the area and headed southwest into the South China Sea to patrol off Camranh Bay on the coast of Japanese-occupied French Indochina.

On 4 February 1945, &quot;Blueback&quot; spotted a Japanese convoy heading south toward Camranh Bay and immediately tried to close for an attack but was unable to get near enough to fire her torpedoes. She encountered the same convoy again on 5 February, but once more failed to close the range for an attack. She began lifeguard duties in support of Allied airstrikes on 7 February, taking station to the southeast of Camranh Bay on the Hong Kong-to-Singapore sea route. This duty ended on 8 February, and she set a course for Fremantle, Australia. Over the next three days, she took part in a search for a Japanese battleship task force headed north from Singapore but never detected it. On 14 February 1945, she received orders changing her destination from Fremantle to Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, and she arrived there on 15 February 1945, concluding her patrol.

At Subic Bay, &quot;Blueback&quot; moored alongside the submarine tender for a refit. She got underway a few days later for exercises in the waters of the Philippine Islands.

=====Second war patrol=====

Operating in a coordinated attack group with the submarines , , , and , &quot;Blueback&quot; began her second war patrol on 4 March 1945 and headed for the area in the South China Sea off the coast of French Indochina. In the early morning of 12 March 1945, a Japanese patrol boat opened fire on her while she was running on the surface. Going deep immediately to evade her attacker, &quot;Blueback&quot; escaped with only superficial damage. Later that day, she opened fire with her deck guns on a Japanese sailing vessel and sank it. Thereafter, her patrol passed uneventfully until 22 March 1945, when she sank another small Japanese sailing ship with gunfire. Her next action occurred on 26 March, when she fired five torpedoes from her stern torpedo tubes at a Japanese escort destroyer in a convoy, but all five missed. During her attempt to leave the area, she endured a heavy depth-charge barrage before losing her pursuers.

On 27 March 1945, an Allied search plane reported a Japanese convoy to the south of &quot;Blueback&quot;″s coordinated attack group. On 28 March, &quot;Blueback&quot; sighted the ships and began tracking them. At 10:58, she brought her stern torpedo tubes to bear and fired a three-torpedo spread at a Japanese destroyer. One broached and the rest ran wide of the mark. Again, she weathered a depth-charge attack before getting clear of the area. On 30 March 1945, she attacked three Japanese sailboats with her deck guns and sent two of them to the bottom.

On 3 April 1945, &quot;Blueback&quot; set a course for the Java Sea. She patrolled off Sumbawa and Lombok in the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies until 12 April without making any contacts and then headed for Australia. She concluded her patrol at Fremantle, Australia, on 17 April 1945 and commenced a refit alongside the submarine tender .

=====Third war patrol=====

After a series of post-refit training exercises, &quot;Blueback&quot; embarked on her third war patrol on 12 May 1945. She entered Lombok Strait on 17 May and spotted her first target, a Japanese sailboat, on 21 May. She opened fire with her gun but inflicted only minor damage on the sailboat. On 28 May, she sighted a Japanese submarine chaser and maneuvered into position for an attack. She fired five torpedoes from her bow torpedo tubes at the submarine chaser and then swung her stern tubes to bear for two more. The submarine chaser sustained no damage and returned remarkably accurate fire with her guns. &quot;Blueback&quot; then departed the area and set a course for the Sunda Strait.

&quot;Blueback&quot; later sighted several Japanese vessels that were not worth attacking before zeroing in on a Japanese convoy of two large cargo ships with three escorts on 2 June 1945. She fired three torpedoes at the nearest cargo ship and heard one hit. However, loss of depth control prevented her from pursuing the attack. She came to rest on the ocean bottom while undergoing a depth-charge barrage and remained there for almost two hours before surfacing.

On 3 June 1945, &quot;Blueback&quot; sank a small Japanese boat with her deck guns. Thereafter, her patrol passed uneventfully until 9 June 1945, when she launched a lone torpedo at a Japanese merchant ship. Once again the shot missed. &quot;Blueback&quot; then shaped a course for Fremantle, where she arrived on 14 June 1945. In addition to a refit, she took up investigations into torpedo accuracy problems. She completed this work on 20 June and resumed her patrol on 21 June 1945.

On 26 June 1945, &quot;Blueback&quot; entered Lombok Strait and received a contact report on Japanese ships sighted north of Bali. At 01:50 on 27 June, she fired five torpedoes. One hit a few minutes later and stopped the Japanese ship dead in the water. Another hit the victim amidships, causing her to disappear from sight.

&quot;Blueback&quot; attacked a Japanese sailboat to the east of the Thousand Islands without success on 9 July 1945. On 13 July, while patrolling north of the Thousand Islands, she spotted five small coastal cargo ships. Although she launched three torpedoes at one of the ships, all missed the target. &quot;Blueback&quot; set course for the Philippine Islands on 15 July and arrived in Subic Bay on 20 July 1945. During her upkeep and training at Subic Bay, World War II came to an end on 15 August 1945 with the cessation of hostilities with Japan.

=====Later operations=====
During the period from 16 December 1944 to 20 July 1945 &quot;Blueback&quot; completed three war patrols in the South China Sea and Java Sea. She sank a 300-displacement ton submarine chaser as well as eight smaller vessels and inserted a Z Special Unit operative on the north coast of Java in Operation Binatang. She arrived at Subic Bay, Luzon, Philippines, from her third and last war patrol on 20 July 1945.

On 10 July 1945, while in the Java Sea, Ensign John Thomas Beahan, a gunnery officer, was inspecting a .50-caliber gun on the deck of the USS Blueback (SS 326) when it unexpectedly fired two rounds, fatally striking him in the chest. Beahan was buried at sea two days later. Beahan was only Blueback&#x27;s non-combat casualty.

====Post-World War II====

On 31 August 1945, &quot;Blueback&quot; got underway from Subic Bay bound for Guam in the Mariana Islands, where she arrived on 4 September 1945. She was assigned to Submarine Squadron 36 and conducted daily underway training. On 28 November 1945, she left Guam in company with Submarine Squadron 3 for a training cruise to the Caroline Islands and Admiralty Islands. The submarines returned to Guam on 15 December 1945.

&quot;Blueback&quot; departed Guam on 12 January 1946 bound for San Diego, California. She conducted operations locally from San Diego unti1 12 August 1946, when she embarked upon a cruise to the Far East. Her ports of call included Pearl Harbor, Truk in the Caroline Islands, Subic Bay, and Tsingtao and Shanghai in China. She returned to San Diego on 29 November 1946 and resumed local operations. On 17 February 1947, she set out on a training voyage to Pearl Harbor. After several weeks of operations in Hawaiian waters, she returned to San Diego on 4 April 1947 and resumed local operations and training along the coast of California, which she continued until March 1948.

On 4 March 1948, &quot;Blueback&quot; departed San Diego and, after a stop at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, proceeded across the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea to İzmir, Turkey, where she arrived on 11 May 1948. She was decommissioned and transferred to Turkey on 23 May 1948. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 May 1948.

====Honors and awards====
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two battle stars for World War II service
* World War II Victory Medal
* China Service Medal

=== Turkish Naval Forces ===

On 25 May 1948, the submarine was commissioned in the Turkish Naval Forces as TCG &quot;İkinci Inönü&quot; (D-2) (also written TCG &quot;2. Inönü&quot; (D-2), English &quot;Second Inönü&quot;), the second of three Turkish submarines named for the Second Battle of İnönü, fought from 23 March to 1 April 1921 during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, a part of the larger Turkish War of Independence. &quot;İkinci Inönü&quot; received the new pennant number S-18 in 1955, and in 1959 was renumbered S 331 in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) pennant system.

After long service in the Turkish Naval Forces, &quot;İkinci Inönü&quot; was decommissioned and transferred back to the United States on 30 November 1973. She then was renamed TCG &quot;Ceryan Botu-2&quot; (Y-1241) and it was used to charge the batteries of other submarines until 1975. She subsequently was transferred back to the United States and sold for scrapping.

<text>Hethum I (Armenian: Հեթում Ա; 1213 – 21 October 1270) ruled the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia (also known as &quot;Little Armenia&quot;) from 1226 to 1270. He was the son of Constantine of Baberon (d. 1263) and Princess Alix Pahlavouni of Lampron (a third-cousin of Leo I) and was the founder of the dynasty which bears his name: the Hethumids also known as the House of Lampron. Having accepted the suzerainty of the Mongol Empire, Hethum himself traveled to the Mongol court in Karakorum, Mongolia, a famous account of which is given by Hethum&#x27;s companion, the historian Kirakos Gandzaketsi, in his &quot;History of Armenia&quot;. He allied with the Mongols to fight against the Muslim Mamluks and also encouraged other Crusader states to do the same.

==Family==
Hethum&#x27;s father Constantine had been regent for the young Isabella, Queen of Armenia. Isabella originally married Philip (1222–1225), son of Bohemond IV of Antioch. However, Constantine had Philip disposed of, and instead forced Isabella to marry his own son, Hethum, on June 14, 1226, to make Isabella and Hethum co-rulers. The couple had six children:
# Leo II (died 1289)
# Thoros (died at the Battle of Mari in 1266 fighting the Mamluks) - Thoros had one child: Melkum.
# Sibylla (died 1290), who married Bohemond VI of Antioch
# Euphemie (died 1309), who married to Julian Grenier, Lord of Sidon
# Rita of Armenia, married Constantine of Servantikar
# Maria, who married Guy of Ibelin, son of Baldwin of Ibelin, Seneschal of Cyprus
#Rouben
#Vasak.

==Armenian-Mongol relations==
Hethum was a major player in the political struggles and shifting alliances around the Crusader states, as the Armenians had ties with all sides. They were primarily aligned with the Europeans, but during Hethum&#x27;s reign, the rapidly expanding Mongol Empire became a concern. When the Mongol commander Baiju attacked the Sultanate of Rum, the Seljuq sultan Kaykhusraw II called on Hethum to come to his aid. Faced with internal disagreements about the war and likely sensing that the Mongols were the greater threat, Hethum delayed and Kaykhusraw&#x27;s army left without the Armenians. After the Mongols inflicted a crushing defeat on the Seljuqs at Kösedağ and approached the borders of Cappadocia and Cilicia, King Hethum made a strategic decision to submit to Mongol suzerainty. He sent his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in Karakorum. There, Sempad met Great Khan Güyük, and made a formal agreement in 1247 in which Cilician Armenia would be considered a vassal state of the Mongol Empire. 

In 1245, Cilicia was attacked by the Sultanate of Rum, prompted by Hethum&#x27;s decision to hand over Sultan Kaykhusraw&#x27;s wife and daughter (who had found refuge at his court after Kösedağ) to Baiju. The Seljuks were aided by Hethum&#x27;s disloyal vassal, Constantine of Lampron. Kaykhusraw was only able to seize a few forts which the Mongols forced him to return a few years later, while Constantine was captured and executed in 1250. 

In 1254, Hethum himself traveled through Central Asia to Mongolia to renew the agreement, passing through the Turkish states of eastern Asia Minor, the Mongol camp at Kars in Greater Armenia, the Iron Gates of Derbent at the western shore of the Caspian Sea, and from there across Asia to Karakorum. He brought many sumptuous presents, and met with Möngke Khan (Güyük&#x27;s cousin). An account of his travels was recorded by a member of his suite, Kirakos Gandzaketsi as &quot;Travels of Haithon, the Pious King of the Armenians, to Batu and Mangu Khans&quot;, the 58th chapter of Gandzaketsi&#x27;s &quot;History of Armenia&quot;. The Journey of Hethoum was later translated into Russian, French, English, and Chinese. The narrative is important for its observations of Mongol, Buddhist, and Chinese culture, geography, and wildlife.

On his way back from Karakorum, Hethum passed through Samarkand and northern Persia, also visiting the Mongol leader Baiju, where he was present in his camp to witness Baiju&#x27;s victory in Asia Minor against the Seljuq Turks.

Hethum strongly encouraged other Frankish rulers to follow his example and submit to Mongol suzerainty, but the only one who did so was Hethum&#x27;s son-in-law, Bohemond VI of Antioch, who submitted around 1259. Armenian troops were with the Mongol army that captured Baghdad in 1258, and both Armenians and Antiochenes Crusaders fought in the Mongol Army under Hulagu at the Siege of Aleppo and Fall of Damascus in 1260. Historical accounts, quoting from the writings of the medieval historian Templar of Tyre, often give a dramatic account of the three Christian rulers (Hethum, Bohemond, and the Mongol general Kitbuqa) entering the city of Damascus together in triumph, though modern historians have questioned this story as apocryphal.

Despite the Mongols&#x27; territorial gains, in September 1260, the Egyptian Mamluks rallied, defeating the Mongols at the historic Battle of Ain Jalut and driving them back across the Euphrates River. The Mongols would not again capture Syria until 1299–1300, when again they would hold it only for a few months.

==Retirement==
During the last years of Hethum&#x27;s reign, largely as a result of Hethum&#x27;s active support of the Mongols, the kingdom came under increasing attack by the Mamluks under Baybars, who invaded in 1266. The heavily outnumbered Armenians were unable to hold off the Mamluks at the Disaster of Mari, during which one of Hethum&#x27;s sons, Thoros, was killed and another son, Leo, was captured and imprisoned. Following this defeat, the cities of Adana, Tarsus, and Ayas were assaulted and the capital of Sis was sacked and burnt. Thousands of Armenians were massacred and 40,000 taken captive. Hethum was able to ransom his son by conceding territory to the Egyptians. In May 1268, the allied Principality of Antioch was overrun by the Egyptians who, under Baybars, captured it and massacred its inhabitants and destroyed all its churches.

Hethum abdicated in 1270 in favor of his son Leo, and lived out the rest of his life in a monastery, as a monk.

<text>The capital ships of a navy are its most important warships; they are generally the larger ships when compared to other warships in their respective fleet. A capital ship is generally a leading or a primary ship in a naval fleet.

== Strategic implications ==
There is usually no formal criterion for the classification, but it is a useful concept in naval strategy; for example, it permits comparisons between relative naval strengths in a theatre of operations without the need for considering specific details of tonnage or gun diameters.

A notable example of this is the Mahanian doctrine, which was applied in the planning of the defence of Singapore in World War II, where the Royal Navy had to decide the allocation of its battleships and battlecruisers between the Atlantic and Pacific theatres. The Mahanian doctrine was also applied by the Imperial Japanese Navy, leading to its preventive move to attack Pearl Harbor and the battleships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The naval nature of the Pacific Theater of Operations, more commonly referred to as the Pacific War, necessitated the United States Navy mostly deploying its battleships and aircraft carriers in the Pacific. The war in Europe was primarily a land war; consequently, Germany&#x27;s surface fleet was small, and the escort ships used in the Battle of the Atlantic were mostly destroyers and destroyer escorts to counter the U-boat threat.

== Age of Sail ==
Before the advent of the all-steel navy in the late 19th century, a capital ship during the Age of Sail was generally understood as a ship that conformed to the Royal Navy&#x27;s rating system of a ship of the line as being of the first, second, third or fourth rates:
* First rate: 100 or more guns, typically carried on three or four decks. Four-deckers suffered in rough seas, and the lowest deck could seldom fire except in calm conditions .
* Second rate: 90–98 guns.
* Third rate: 64 to 80 guns (although 64-gun third-raters were small and not very numerous in any era).
* Fourth rate: 46 to 60 guns. By 1756, these ships were acknowledged to be too weak to stand in the line of battle and were relegated to ancillary duties, although they also served in the shallow North Sea and American littorals where larger ships of the line could not sail.

Frigates were ships of the fifth rate; sixth rates comprised small frigates and corvettes. Towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars and into the late 19th century, some larger and more powerful frigates were classified as fourth rates.

== Battleship / battlecruiser ==

The term &quot;capital ship&quot; was coined in 1909 and formally defined in the limitation treaties of the 1920s and 1930s, in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, 1930 London Naval Treaty, and 1936 Second London Naval Treaty. This applied mainly to ships resulting from the dreadnought revolution; dreadnought battleships (also known first as dreadnoughts and later as battleships) and battlecruisers. The term is defined in the 1936 Montreux Convention as well.

In the 20th century, especially in World Wars I and II, typical capital ships would be battleships and battlecruisers. All of the above ships were close to 20,000 tons displacement or heavier, with large caliber guns and heavy armor protection.

Cruisers, despite being important ships, were not considered capital ships. An exception to the above in World War II was the . Though this class was technically similar to a heavy cruiser, albeit slower but with considerably heavier guns, they were regarded by some as capital ships (hence the British label &quot;Pocket battleship&quot;) since they were one of the few heavy surface units of the Kriegsmarine. The American , Dutch Design 1047 battlecruiser and the Japanese Design B-65 cruiser, planned specifically to counter the heavy cruisers being built by their naval rivals, have been described as &quot;super cruisers&quot;, &quot;large cruisers&quot; or even &quot;unrestricted cruisers&quot;, with some advocating that they even be considered battlecruisers; however, they were never classified as capital ships.

During the Cold War, a Soviet large missile cruiser had a displacement great enough to rival World War II-era battleships and battlecruisers, perhaps defining a new capital ship for that era. In regard to technical design, however, the &quot;Kirov&quot; is simply a supersized guided-missile cruiser with nuclear propulsion.

== Aircraft carrier ==
It took until late 1942 for aircraft carriers to be universally considered capital ships. Only full-size fleet carriers (whether purpose built, or converted from battleship/battlecruiser hulls) were regarded as capital ships, while light carriers (often using cruiser hulls) and escort carriers (often using merchant ship hulls) were not. The U.S. Navy was forced to rely primarily on its aircraft carriers after the attack on Pearl Harbor sank or damaged eight of its Pacific-fleet battleships.

In the 21st century, the aircraft carrier is the last remaining capital ship, with capability defined in decks available and aircraft per deck rather than in guns and calibers. The United States possesses supremacy in both contemporary categories of aircraft carriers, possessing 11 active duty supercarriers each capable of carrying and launching nearly 100 tactical aircraft, and nine amphibious assault ships which are equivalent in the &quot;Sea Control Ship&quot; configuration to the light VSTOL carriers operated by other nations.

== Nuclear submarines ==

Nuclear submarines, while important ships and similar in tonnage to early battleships, are usually counted as part of a nation&#x27;s nuclear deterrent force and do not share the sea control mission of traditional capital ships. Nevertheless, many navies, including the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, consider these ships to be capital ships and have given some of them names previously used for battleships, e.g. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and &quot;Vanguard&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot;.

== Naming ==
Some navies reserve specific names for their capital ships. Names reserved for capital ships include chiefs of state (e.g. ), important places, historically important naval officers or admiralty (e.g. ), historical events or objects (e.g. ), and traditional names (e.g. ). However, there are some exceptions to the rule.

Beginning with (the first U.S. battleship), U.S. capital ships were traditionally named after U.S. states. Cruisers are typically named after U.S. territories (e.g. Alaska-class cruisers just before and during World War II) or U.S. cities. Prior to and during World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy also followed the practice of naming battleships after provinces (e.g. ).

Despite their significance to modern fleets, the U.S. Navy has never named aircraft carriers after U.S. states. Today, U.S. aircraft carriers are usually named after politicians and other individuals notable in US naval history such as Gerald R. Ford and Chester W. Nimitz except &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Beginning with the first class of Trident-equipped ballistic missile submarines (i.e. the ), state names have been applied to U.S. nuclear submarines. Previous ballistic missile submarines (e.g. Poseidon missile-equipped submarines) had not been named for states. After the completion of the last &quot;Ohio&quot;-class ballistic missile submarine, state names were also applied to attack submarines (e.g. ). Earlier attack submarines had usually been named for marine animals or, commencing with the , cities and towns.

<doc id="403882" wikidata="Q126363589" url="?curid=403882" title="Kingship and kingdom of God">
<text>The concept of the kingship of God appears in all Abrahamic religions, where in some cases the terms kingdom of God and kingdom of Heaven are also used. The notion of God&#x27;s kingship goes back to the Hebrew Bible, which refers to &quot;his kingdom&quot; but does not include the term &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;.

The &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; and its equivalent form &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; in the Gospel of Matthew is one of the key elements of the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament. The Gospel of Mark indicates that the gospel is the good news about the Kingdom of God. The term pertains to the kingship of Christ over all creation. The phrase &quot;Kingdom of heaven&quot; appears in Matthew&#x27;s gospel due primarily to Jewish sensibilities about uttering the &quot;name&quot; (God). Jesus did not teach the kingdom of God &quot;per se&quot; so much as the &quot;return&quot; of that kingdom. The notion of God&#x27;s kingdom (as it had been under Moses) returning became an agitation in &quot;knaan,&quot; modern Israel, 60 years before Jesus was born, and continued to be a force for nearly a hundred years after his death. Drawing on Old Testament teachings, the Christian characterization of the relationship between God and humanity inherently involves the notion of the &quot;Kingship of God&quot;.

The Quran does not use the term &quot;kingdom of God&quot;, but includes the Throne Verse which talks about the throne of God encompassing the heavens and the Earth. The Quran also refers to Abraham seeing the &quot;Kingdom of the heavens&quot;. Writings of the Baháʼí Faith also use the term &quot;kingdom of God&quot;.

==Zoroastrianism==
Zoroastrianism, a possible influence on Abrahamic traditions,
includes the concept of a &quot;kingdom of God&quot; or of a divine kingship:
In the &quot;Gāthās&quot; Zoroaster&#x27;s thoughts about &quot;khšathra&quot; as a thing turn mostly to the &#x27;dominion&#x27; or &#x27;kingdom&#x27; of God, which was conceived, it seems, both as heaven itself, thought of as lying just above the visible sky, and as the kingdom of God to come on earth which is also represented by Khšathra - hence, presumably, his standing epithet of &quot;vairya&quot; &#x27;desirable&#x27;; for as Christians pray to God, &#x27;Thy kingdom come ...&#x27;, so also Zoroastrians long to establish the kingdom of Ahura Mazdā here below. [...] The heavenly aspect of khšathra/Khšathra has plainly a pagan origin, for in the Vedas Paradise is the kṣatra of Varuṇa, the kingdom of heaven which for their own happiness men longed to attain.
==Hebrew Bible==

The term &quot;kingdom of the LORD&quot; appears twice in the Hebrew Bible, in and . In addition, &quot;his kingdom&quot; and &quot;your kingdom&quot; are sometimes used when referring to God. &quot;Yours is the kingdom, O Lord&quot; is used in and &quot;His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom&quot; in ( in the verse numbering used in Christian Bibles) for example. There are also verses like that show how Israel, as God&#x27;s chosen people, are considered to be a kingdom, mirroring some Christian interpretations that view God&#x27;s kingdom as Christendom.

&quot;The Hebrew word &quot;malkuth&quot; [...] refers first to a reign, dominion, or rule and only secondarily to the realm over which a reign is exercised. [...] When &quot;malkuth&quot; is used of God, it almost always refers to his authority or to his rule as the heavenly King.&quot;
The &quot;enthronement psalms&quot; (Psalms , , , ) provide a background for this view with the exclamation &quot;The Lord is King&quot;.

, Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1 and all speak of the Throne of God, although some philosophers such as Saadia Gaon and Maimonides interpreted such mention of a &quot;throne&quot; as allegory.

==Intertestamental period==

The phrase &quot;the Kingdom of God&quot; is not common in intertestamental literature. Where it does occur, such as in the Psalms of Solomon and the Wisdom of Solomon, it usually refers to &quot;God&#x27;s reign, not to the realm over which he reigns, nor to the new age, [nor to ...] the messianic order to be established by the Lord&#x27;s Anointed&quot;.

The term does occasionally, however, denote &quot;an eschatological event&quot;, such as in the Assumption of Moses and the Sibylline Oracles. In these works, &quot;God&#x27;s Kingdom is not the new age but the effective manifestation of his rule in all the world so that the eschatological order is established.&quot; Along these lines was the more &quot;national&quot; view in which the awaited messiah was seen as a liberator and the founder of a new state of Israel.

==New Testament==
The Gospel of Luke records Jesus&#x27; description of the Kingdom of God, &quot;The kingdom of God does not come with observation; neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.&quot;

In the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus speaks frequently of God&#x27;s kingdom. However within the New Testament, nowhere does Jesus appear to clearly define the concept. Within the Synoptic Gospel accounts, the assumption appears to have been made that, &quot;this was a concept so familiar that it did not require definition.&quot; Karen Wenell wrote, &quot;Mark&#x27;s Gospel provides for us a significant place of transformation for the space of the Kingdom of God, precisely because it can be understood as a kind of birthplace for the Kingdom of God, the beginning of its construction ...&quot;.

John&#x27;s Gospel refers to the Kingdom of God in Jesus&#x27; dialogue with Nicodemus in chapter 3. Constantin von Tischendorf&#x27;s text is exceptional in referring to &quot;the kingdom of heaven&quot; in John 3:5, on evidence which Heinrich Meyer describes as &quot;ancient but yet inadequate&quot;.

Within the non-canonical, yet contemporary Gnostic Gospel of Thomas, Jesus is quoted as saying, &quot;If those who lead you say to you: ‘Look, the kingdom is in the sky!’ then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you: ‘It is in the sea,’ then the fishes will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is inside of you and outside of you. When you come to know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will realize that you are the children of the living Father.&quot; This same Gospel of Thomas further describes Jesus as implying that the Kingdom of God is already present, saying, &quot;The kingdom of the Father is spread out upon the earth, and people do not see it.”

The Apostle Paul described the Kingdom of God in his letter to the church in Rome: &quot;For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&quot;
The Kingdom of God (and its possibly equivalent form Kingdom of Heaven in the Gospel of Matthew) is one of the key elements of the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament. Drawing on Old Testament teachings, the Christian characterization of the relationship between God and humanity inherently involves the notion of the &quot;Kingship of God&quot;.

Most of the uses of the Greek word, &quot;basileia&quot; (kingdom), in the New Testament involve Kingdom of God (or Kingdom of Heaven). Matthew is likely to have instead used the term heaven because the background of his Jewish audience imposed restrictions on the frequent use of the name of God. However, Dr. Chuck Missler asserts that Matthew intentionally differentiated between the kingdoms of God and Heaven: &quot;Most commentators presume that these terms are synonymous. However, Matthew uses &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; 33 times, but also uses &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; five times, even in adjacent verses, which indicates that these are not synonymous: he is using a more denotative term.&quot; Kingdom of God is translated to Latin as &quot;Regnum Dei&quot; and Kingdom of Heaven as &quot;Regnum caelorum&quot;.

==Christianity==


The Old Testament refers to &quot;God the Judge of all&quot; and the notion that all humans will eventually be judged is an essential element of Christian teachings. Building on a number of New Testament passages, the Nicene Creed indicates that the task of judgment is assigned to Jesus.

No overall agreement on the theological interpretation of &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; has emerged among scholars. While a number of theological interpretations of the term Kingdom of God have appeared in its eschatological context, e.g. apocalyptic, realized or Inaugurated eschatologies, no consensus has emerged among scholars.

R. T. France points out that while the concept of &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; has an intuitive meaning to lay Christians, there is hardly any agreement among scholars about its meaning in the New Testament. Some scholars see it as a Christian lifestyle, some as a method of world evangelization, some as the rediscovery of charismatic gifts, others relate it to no present or future situation, but the world to come. France states that the phrase Kingdom of God is often interpreted in many ways to fit the theological agenda of those interpreting it.

In the New Testament, the Throne of God is alluded to in several forms. Among these are Heaven as the Throne of God, The Throne of David, The Throne of Glory, The Throne of Grace and many more. The New Testament continues Jewish identification of heaven itself as the &quot;throne of God&quot;, but also locates the throne of God as &quot;in heaven&quot; and having a second subordinate seat at the Right Hand of God for the Session of Christ.

==Islam==
The term &quot;kingdom of God&quot; does not occur in the Quran. The modern Arabic word for kingdom is &quot;mamlaka&quot; (المملكة), but in the Quran &quot;mul&#x27;kan&quot; (مُّلْكًا), refers to Heaven, e.g. in 4:54 &quot;Or do they envy mankind for what Allah hath given them of his bounty? but We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom&quot; and 6:75 &quot;Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth.&quot; The variant &quot;Maalik&quot; (Owner, etmologically similar to &quot;Malik&quot; (king)) occurs in 1:4 &quot;[Allah is] The owner of the Day of Judgement&quot;.

==Bahá&#x27;í Faith==

The term &quot;kingdom of God&quot; appears in the writings of the Baháʼí Faith, including the religious works of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the religion, and his son `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá. In the Baháʼí teachings, the kingdom of God is seen both as a state of individual being, and the state of the world. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh claimed that the scriptures of the world&#x27;s religions foretell a coming messianic figure that will bring a golden age of humanity, the kingdom of God on earth. He claimed to be that figure, and that his teachings would bring about the kingdom of God; he also noted that the prophecies relating to the end times and the arrival of the kingdom of God were symbolic and referred to spiritual upheaval and renewal. The Baháʼí teachings also state as people worship and serve humanity they become closer to God and develop spiritually, so that they can attain eternal life and enter the kingdom of God while alive.

<text>Stealth aircraft are designed to avoid detection using a variety of technologies that reduce reflection/emission of radar, infrared, visible light, radio frequency (RF) spectrum, and audio, collectively known as stealth technology. The F-117 Nighthawk was the first operational aircraft explicitly designed around stealth technology. Other examples of stealth aircraft include the B-2 Spirit, the B-21 Raider, the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 Lightning II, the Chengdu J-20, and the Sukhoi Su-57.

While no aircraft is completely invisible to radar, stealth aircraft make it more difficult for conventional radar to detect or track the aircraft effectively, increasing the odds of an aircraft avoiding detection by enemy radar and/or avoiding being successfully targeted by radar guided weapons. Stealth is a combination of passive low observable (LO) features and active emitters such as low-probability-of-intercept radars, radios and laser designators. These are typically combined with operational measures such as carefully planning mission maneuvers to minimize the aircraft&#x27;s radar cross-section, since common hard turns or opening bomb bay doors can more than double an otherwise stealthy aircraft&#x27;s radar return. Stealth is accomplished by using a complex design philosophy to reduce the ability of an opponent&#x27;s sensors to detect, track, or attack the stealth aircraft. This philosophy takes into account the heat, sound, and other emissions of the aircraft which can also be used to locate it. Sensors are made to reduce the impact of low observable technologies and others have been proposed such as IRST (infrared search and track) systems to detect even reduced heat emissions, long wavelength radars to counter stealth shaping and RAM focused on shorter wavelength radar, or radar setups with multiple emitters to counter stealth shaping. However these have disadvantages compared to traditional radar against non-stealthy aircraft.

Full-size stealth combat aircraft demonstrators have been flown by the United States (in 1977), Russia (in 2000) and China (in 2011). , the only combat-ready stealth aircraft in service are the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit (1997), the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor (2005), the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II (2015), the Chengdu J-20 (2017), and the Sukhoi Su-57 (2020), with a number of other countries developing their own designs. There are also various aircraft with reduced detectability, either unintentionally or as a secondary feature.

In the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia two stealth aircraft were used by the United States, the veteran F-117 Nighthawk, and the newly introduced B-2 Spirit strategic stealth bomber. The F-117 performed its usual role of striking precision high-value targets and performed well, although one F-117 was shot down by a Serbian Isayev S-125 &#x27;Neva-M&#x27; missile brigade commanded by Colonel Zoltán Dani.

==Design principles==
Besides all the usual demands of flight, the design of a stealth or low-observability aircraft aims to reduce radar and infrared (thermal) detection, including:

*Reduce thermal infra-red emission from the engine and its exhaust wake
*Reduce radar reflection back to a hostile receiver by shaping the airframe
*Reduce radar reflections from the airframe by the use of radar-absorbent materials (RAM) or radar-transparent materials such as plastics.
*Reduce radar detection from exposed internal surfaces such as the cockpit, weapons bay and engine intake ducting.
*Reduce infra-red and radar detection during adverse weather conditions

The distance at which a target can be detected for a given radar configuration varies with the fourth root of its RCS. Therefore, in order to cut the detection distance to one tenth, the RCS should be reduced by a factor of 10,000.

Rotorcraft introduce a particular design challenge, due not only to their multiple wing surfaces and articulated joints, but also to the constantly-changing relationship of these to the main airframe surfaces. The Boeing–Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche was one of the first attempts at a stealth helicopter.

==Limitations==
===Instability of design===
Early stealth aircraft were designed with a focus on minimal radar cross section (RCS) rather than aerodynamic performance. Highly stealthy aircraft like the F-117 Nighthawk are aerodynamically unstable in all three axes and require constant flight corrections from a fly-by-wire (FBW) flight system to maintain controlled flight. As for the B-2 Spirit, which was based on the development of the flying wing aircraft by Jack Northrop in 1940, this design allowed for a stable aircraft with sufficient yaw control, even without vertical surfaces such as rudders.

===Aerodynamic limitations===
Earlier stealth aircraft (such as the F-117 and B-2) lack afterburners, because the hot exhaust would increase their infrared footprint, and flying faster than the speed of sound would produce an obvious sonic boom, as well as surface heating of the aircraft skin, which also increases the infrared footprint. As a result, their performance in air combat maneuvering required in a dogfight would never match that of a dedicated fighter aircraft. This was unimportant in the case of these two aircraft since both were designed to be bombers. More recent design techniques allow for stealthy designs such as the F-22 without compromising aerodynamic performance. Newer stealth aircraft, like the F-22, F-35 and the Su-57, have performance characteristics that meet or exceed those of current front-line jet fighters due to advances in other technologies such as flight control systems, engines, airframe construction and materials.

===Electromagnetic emissions===
The high level of computerization and large amount of electronic equipment found inside stealth aircraft are often claimed to make them vulnerable to passive detection. This is highly unlikely and certainly systems such as Tamara and Kolchuga, which are often described as counter-stealth radars, are not designed to detect stray electromagnetic fields of this type. Such systems are designed to detect intentional, higher power emissions such as radar and communication signals. Stealth aircraft are deliberately operated to avoid or reduce such emissions.

Current Radar Warning Receivers look for the regular pings of energy from mechanically swept radars while fifth generation jet fighters use Low Probability of Intercept Radars with no regular repeat pattern.

===Vulnerable modes of flight===
Stealth aircraft are still vulnerable to detection while and immediately after using their weaponry. Since stealth payload (reduced RCS bombs and cruise missiles) is not yet generally available, and ordnance mount points create a significant radar return, stealth aircraft carry all armaments internally. As soon as weapons bay doors are opened, the plane&#x27;s RCS will be multiplied and even older generation radar systems will be able to locate the stealth aircraft. While the aircraft will reacquire its stealth as soon as the bay doors are closed, a fast response defensive weapons system has a short opportunity to engage the aircraft.

This vulnerability is addressed by operating in a manner that reduces the risk and consequences of temporary acquisition. The B-2&#x27;s operational altitude imposes a flight time for defensive weapons that makes it virtually impossible to engage the aircraft during its weapons deployment. New stealth aircraft designs such as the F-22 and F-35 can open their bays, release munitions and return to stealthy flight in less than a second.

Some weapons require that the weapon&#x27;s guidance system acquire the target while the weapon is still attached to the aircraft. This forces relatively extended operations with the bay doors open.

Such aircraft as the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter can also carry additional weapons and fuel on hardpoints below their wings. When operating in this mode the planes will not be nearly as stealthy, as the hardpoints and the weapons mounted on those hardpoints will show up on radar systems. This option therefore represents a trade off between stealth or range and payload. External stores allow those aircraft to attack more targets further away, but will not allow for stealth during that mission as compared to a shorter range mission flying on just internal fuel and using only the more limited space of the internal weapon bays for armaments.

===Reduced payload===
Fully stealth aircraft carry all fuel and armament internally, which limits the payload. By way of comparison, the F-117 carries only two laser- or GPS-guided bombs, while a non-stealth attack aircraft can carry several times more. This requires the deployment of additional aircraft to engage targets that would normally require a single non-stealth attack aircraft. This apparent disadvantage however is offset by the reduction in fewer supporting aircraft that are required to provide air cover, air-defense suppression and electronic counter measures, making stealth aircraft &quot;force multipliers&quot;.

===Sensitive skin===

Stealth aircraft often have skins made with radiation-absorbent materials (RAMs). Some of these contain carbon black particles, while some contain tiny iron spheres. There are many materials used in RAMs, and some are classified, particularly the materials that specific aircraft use.

===Cost of operations===
Stealth aircraft are typically more expensive to develop and manufacture. An example is the B-2 Spirit that is many times more expensive to manufacture and support than conventional bomber aircraft. The B-2 program cost the U.S. Air Force almost $45 billion.

==Countermeasures==

===Reflected waves===

Passive (multistatic) radar, bistatic radar and especially multistatic radar systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional monostatic radars, since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F-117) reflects energy away from the transmitter&#x27;s line of sight, effectively increasing the radar cross section (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor. Such a system typically uses either low frequency broadcast TV and FM radio signals (at which frequencies controlling the aircraft&#x27;s signature is more difficult).

Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign with support of DARPA, have shown that it is possible to build a synthetic aperture radar image of an aircraft target using passive multistatic radar, possibly detailed enough to enable automatic target recognition.

In December 2007, SAAB researchers revealed details for a system called Associative Aperture Synthesis Radar (AASR) that would employ a large array of inexpensive and redundant transmitters and receivers that could detect targets when they directly pass between the receivers/transmitters and create a shadow. The system was originally designed to detect stealthy cruise missiles and should be just as effective against low-flying stealth aircraft. That the array could contain a large amount of inexpensive equipment could potentially offer some &quot;protection&quot; against attacks by expensive anti-radiation missiles (ARMs).

===Infrared (heat)===

Some analysts claim Infra-red search and track systems (IRSTs) can be deployed against stealth aircraft, because any aircraft surface heats up due to air friction and with a two channel IRST is a (4.3 μm absorption maxima) detection possible, through difference comparing between the low and high channel. These analysts point to the resurgence in such systems in Russian designs in the 1980s, such as those fitted to the MiG-29 and Su-27. The latest version of the MiG-29, the MiG-35, is equipped with a new Optical Locator System that includes more advanced IRST capabilities. The French Rafale, the British/German/Italian/Spanish Eurofighter and the Swedish Gripen also make extensive use of IRST.

In air combat, the optronic suite allows:
* Detection of non-afterburning targets at range and more;
* Identification of those targets at range; and
* Estimates of aerial target range at up to .

For ground targets, the suite allows:
* A tank-effective detection range up to , and aircraft carrier detection at ;
* Identification of the tank type on the range, and of an aircraft carrier at ; and
* Estimates of ground target range of up to .

===Longer wavelength radar===

VHF radar systems have wavelengths comparable to aircraft feature sizes and should exhibit scattering in the resonance region rather than the optical region, allowing most stealth aircraft to be detected. This has prompted Nizhny Novgorod Research Institute of Radio Engineering (NNIIRT) to develop VHF AESAs such as the NEBO SVU, which is capable of performing target acquisition for Surface-to-air missile batteries. Despite the advantages offered by VHF radar, their longer wavelengths result in poor resolution compared to comparably sized X band radar array. As a result, these systems must be very large before they can have the resolution for an engagement radar. An example of a ground-based VHF radar with counter-stealth capability is the P-18 radar.

The Dutch company Thales Nederland, formerly known as Holland Signaal, developed a naval phased-array radar called SMART-L, which is operated at L Band and has counter-stealth. All ships of the Royal Dutch Navy&#x27;s De Zeven Provinciën class carry, among others, the SMART-L radar.

===OTH radar (over-the-horizon radar)===
Over-the-horizon radar is a concept increasing radar&#x27;s effective range over conventional radar. The Australian JORN Jindalee Operational Radar Network can overcome certain stealth characteristics. It is claimed that the HF frequency used and the method of bouncing radar from ionosphere overcomes the stealth characteristics of the F-117A. In other words, stealth aircraft are optimized for defeating much higher-frequency radar from front-on rather than low-frequency radars from above.

==History==

===World War I and World War II===
During World War I, the Germans experimented with the use of &quot;Cellon&quot; (Cellulose acetate), a transparent covering material, in an attempt to reduce the visibility of military aircraft. Single examples of the Fokker E.III &quot;Eindecker&quot; fighter monoplane, the Albatros C.I two-seat observation biplane, and the Linke-Hofmann R.I prototype heavy bomber were covered with &quot;Cellon&quot;. However, it proved ineffective, and even counterproductive, as sunlight glinting from the covering made the aircraft even more visible. The material was also found to be quickly degraded both by sunlight and in-flight temperature changes, so the attempt to make transparent aircraft was not proceeded with.

In 1916, the British modified a small SS class airship for the purpose of night-time aerial reconnaissance over German lines on the Western Front. Fitted with a silenced engine and a black gas bag, the craft was both invisible and inaudible from the ground, but several night-time flights over German-held territory produced little useful intelligence, and the idea was dropped.

Nearly three decades later, the Horten Ho 229 flying wing fighter-bomber was developed in Nazi Germany during the last years of World War II. In 1983, its designer Reimar Horten claimed that he planned to add charcoal to the adhesive layers of the plywood skin of the production model to render it invisible to radar. This claim was investigated, as the Ho 229&#x27;s lack of vertical surfaces, an inherent feature of all flying wing aircraft, is also a key characteristic of all stealth aircraft. Tests were performed in 2008 by the Northrop Grumman Corporation to establish if the aircraft&#x27;s shape would have avoided detection by top-end HF-band, 20–30 MHz primary signals of Britain&#x27;s Chain Home early warning radar, if the aircraft was traveling at high speed (approximately ) at extremely low altitude – . The testing did not find any evidence that charcoal was used, and confirmed that it would have been a poor absorber if used, concluding that the Ho 229 did not have stealth characteristics and was never intended to be a stealth aircraft.

===Modern origins===
Modern stealth aircraft first became possible when Denys Overholser, a mathematician working for Lockheed Aircraft during the 1970s, adopted a mathematical model developed by Petr Ufimtsev, a Soviet scientist, to develop a computer program called Echo 1. Echo made it possible to predict the radar signature of an aircraft made with flat panels, called facets. In 1975, engineers at Lockheed Skunk Works found that an aircraft made with faceted surfaces could have a very low radar signature because the surfaces would radiate almost all of the radar energy away from the receiver. Under a 1977 contract from DARPA, Lockheed built a proof of concept demonstrator aircraft, the Lockheed Have Blue, nicknamed &quot;the Hopeless Diamond&quot;, a reference to the famous Hope Diamond and the design&#x27;s shape and predicted instability. Because advanced computers were available to control the flight of an aircraft that was designed for stealth but aerodynamically unstable such as the Have Blue, for the first time designers realized that it might be possible to make an aircraft that was virtually invisible to radar. Lockheed soon developed the Have Blue into F-117.

Reduced radar cross section is only one of five factors the designers addressed to create a truly stealthy design such as the F-22. The F-22 has also been designed to disguise its infrared emissions to make it harder to detect by infrared homing (&quot;heat seeking&quot;) surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. The F-22 puts a focus on air superiority, with supercruise, high thrust-to-weight ratio, integrated avionics, and of course, stealth.

===Modern operations===
The first combat use of purpose-designed stealth aircraft was in December 1989 during Operation Just Cause in Panama. On 20 December 1989, two United States Air Force F-117s bombed a Panamanian Defense Force barracks in Rio Hato, Panama. In 1991, F-117s were tasked with attacking the most heavily fortified targets in Iraq in the opening phase of Operation Desert Storm and were the only coalition aircraft allowed to operate inside Baghdad&#x27;s city limits and over its airspace. The F-117 while having sufficient stealth, also had a low visual signature. Even still, if the F-117 was visually acquired, it, like all aircraft, were subject to visual air-to-air interception. This was easily circumvented by flying at night. 
The U.S, UK, and Israel are the only countries to have used stealth aircraft in combat. These deployments include the United States invasion of Panama, the first Gulf War, the Kosovo Conflict, the War in Afghanistan, the War in Iraq and the 2011 military intervention in Libya. The first use of stealth aircraft was in the U.S. invasion of Panama, where F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft were used to drop bombs on enemy airfields and positions while evading enemy radar.

In 1990 the F-117 Nighthawk was used in the Gulf War, where 42 F-117s flew 1,299 sorties and scored 1,664 direct hits with laser-guided bombs while not suffering battle damage, while hitting 1,600 high-value targets in Iraq. F-117s flew approximately 168 strikes against Scud-associated targets while accumulating 6,905 flight hours. Only 2.5% of the American aircraft in Iraq were F-117s, yet they struck 40% of the strategic targets, dropping 2,000 tons of precision-guided munitions and striking their targets with an 80% success rate. However the F-117 still had flaws; it had to refuel and was defenesless in an enemy attack. All F-117 sorties had to be refueled.

In the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia two stealth aircraft were used by the United States: the veteran F-117 Nighthawk, and the newly introduced B-2 Spirit strategic stealth bomber. The F-117 performed its usual role of striking precision high-value targets and performed well, although one F-117 was shot down by a Serbian Isayev S-125 &#x27;Neva-M&#x27; missile commanded by Colonel Zoltán Dani. The then-new B-2 Spirit was highly successful, destroying 33% of all Serbian bombing targets in the first eight weeks of U.S. involvement in the war. During this war, B-2s flew non-stop to Kosovo from their home base in Missouri and back.

In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, F-117 Nighthawks and B-2 Spirits were used, and this was the last time the F-117 would see combat. F-117s dropped satellite-guided strike munitions on selected targets, with high success. B-2 Spirits conducted 49 sorties in the invasion, releasing more than 1.5 million pounds of munitions.

During the May 2011 operation to kill Osama bin Laden, one of the helicopters used to clandestinely insert U.S. troops into Pakistan crashed in the bin Laden compound. From the wreckage it was revealed this helicopter had stealth characteristics, making this the first publicly known operational use of a stealth helicopter.

Stealth aircraft were used in the 2011 military intervention in Libya, where B-2 Spirits dropped 40 bombs on a Libyan airfield with concentrated air defenses in support of the UN no-fly zone.

Stealth aircraft will continue to play a valuable role in air combat with the United States using the F-22 Raptor, B-2 Spirit, and the F-35 Lightning II to perform a variety of operations. The F-22 made its combat debut over Syria in September 2014 as part of the US-led coalition to defeat ISIS.

From February 2018, Su-57s performed the first international flight as they were spotted landing at the Russian Khmeimim Air Base in Syria. These Su-57s were deployed along with four Sukhoi Su-35 fighters, four Sukhoi Su-25s, and one Beriev A-50 AEW&amp;C aircraft. It is believed that at least 4 Su-57 are deployed in Syria and that they have likely been armed with cruise missiles in combat.

In 2018, a report surfaced noting that Israeli F-35I stealth fighters conducted a number of missions in Syria and even infiltrated Iranian airspace without detection. In May 2018, Major General Amikam Norkin of IAF reported that Israeli Air Force F-35I stealth fighters carried out the first-ever F-35 strike in combat over Syria.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China started flight testing its Chengdu J-20 stealth multirole fighter around in 2011 and made its first public appearance at Airshow China 2016. The aircraft entered service with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) in March 2017. Another fifth-generation stealth multirole fighter from China, the Shenyang FC-31 is also under flight testing.

<doc id="403899" wikidata="Q281442" url="?curid=403899" title="USS Atlanta (CL-51)">
<text>USS &quot;Atlanta&quot; (CL-51) of the United States Navy was the lead ship of the of eight light cruisers. She was the third Navy ship named after the city of Atlanta, Georgia. Designed to provide anti-aircraft protection for US naval task groups, &quot;Atlanta&quot; served in this capacity in the naval battles Midway and the Eastern Solomons. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was heavily damaged by Japanese and friendly gunfire in a night surface action on 13 November 1942 during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The cruiser was sunk on her captain&#x27;s orders in the afternoon of the same day.

&quot;Atlanta&quot;, in some works, is designated CLAA-51 because of her primary armament as an anti-aircraft cruiser. Hence, all of the &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class ships are sometimes designated as CLAA. However, her entire battery of guns were dual-purpose (DP) guns, and were capable of being used against both air and surface targets, able to fire anti-aircraft, high-explosive and armor-piercing shells.

The &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class ships were lightly armored, making them poor surface combatants compared to a typical light cruiser. In terms of armament, the &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class was closer to a destroyer, being armed with 5-inch guns, than a light cruiser, which were generally equipped with 6-inch guns; but at well over in length, and combined with their large battery of sixteen guns (reduced to twelve in number for later ships of the class), they were designated as light cruisers. The unusual features of the &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class is a result of the class originally being intended to be a destroyer leader. A destroyer leader is larger than its destroyer counterparts to accommodate command staff and resources as well as other general utilities to support the destroyers that they would be paired with. In-line with this intended role the ship was given a complement of torpedoes and relatively thin armor compared to other contemporary light cruisers. Later, the dimensions and tonnage of the ship resulted in a change in designation of the &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class from a destroyer leader to a light cruiser. Despite this change in designation the &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class of ships maintained their destroyer leader features, including their destroyer-caliber guns (albeit while mounting significantly more 5 in guns than most contemporary destroyers).

==Construction and commissioning==
The first of the new class of ships was laid down on 22 April 1940 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., launched on 6 September 1941, sponsored by Margaret Mitchell (author of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;), and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 24 December 1941, Captain Samuel P. Jenkins in command.

===Armament===
&quot;Atlanta&quot; was fitted with eight twin 5-inch gun mounts, placed in a unique configuration. She had three forward mounts and three aft mounts, mounted inline and increasing in height toward the midships, giving her a symmetrical appearance, with a &quot;gap&quot; in the middle superstructure. In addition, the aft battery also had one &quot;wing-mounted&quot; mount on each side, for a total of 16 five-inch guns. The firing arcs of the forward and aft batteries intersected at a very limited angle, giving her an arc of 60° in which she could fire all of her guns broadside (excluding the wing mounts). Because &quot;Atlanta&quot; was able to bring all her guns to bear only within that narrow arc, her ability to engage surface targets was limited. Her firing arcs were ideally suited to bringing her guns to bear on an aircraft, however, with a minimum of six guns available from any angle.

==Service history==
After fitting out, &quot;Atlanta&quot; conducted shakedown training until 13 March 1942, first in Chesapeake Bay and then in Maine&#x27;s Casco Bay, after which she returned to the New York Navy Yard for post-shakedown repairs and alterations. Adjudged to be &quot;ready for distant service&quot; on 31 March, the new cruiser departed New York for the Panama Canal Zone on 5 April. She reached Cristobal on 8 April. After transiting the isthmian waterway, &quot;Atlanta&quot; then cleared Balboa on 12 April with orders to reconnoiter Clipperton Island, a tiny barren, uninhabited atoll about 670 mi (1,080 km) southwest of Acapulco, Mexico, in the course of her voyage to the Hawaiian Islands, for any signs of enemy activity. Finding none, she ultimately reached Pearl Harbor on 23 April.

===Battle of Midway===

Punctuating her brief stay in Hawaiian waters with an antiaircraft practice off Oahu on 3 May, &quot;Atlanta&quot;, in company with , sailed on 10 May as escort for and , bound for Nouméa, New Caledonia. On 16 May, she joined Vice Admiral William F. Halsey&#x27;s Task Force 16 (TF 16), formed around the aircraft carriers and , as it steamed back to Pearl Harbor, having been summoned back to Hawaiian waters in response to an imminent Japanese thrust in the direction of Midway Atoll. TF 16 arrived at Pearl on 26 May.

&quot;Atlanta&quot; again sailed with TF 16 on the morning of 28 May. Over the days that followed, she screened the carriers as they operated northeast of Midway in anticipation of the enemy&#x27;s arrival. At the report of Japanese ships to the southwest, on the morning of 4 June, &quot;Atlanta&quot; cleared for action as she screened &quot;Hornet&quot;. Squadrons from the American carriers sought out the Japanese, and during that day, planes from and &quot;Enterprise&quot; inflicted mortal damage on four irreplaceable enemy aircraft carriers. Japanese planes twice hit TF 17, and it took the brunt of the enemy attacks. Over the days that followed the Battle of Midway, &quot;Atlanta&quot; remained in the screen of TF 16 until 11 June, when the task force received orders to return to Pearl Harbor.

Reaching her destination on 13 June, &quot;Atlanta&quot;, outside brief periods of antiaircraft practice on 21 and 25–26 June, remained in port, taking on stores and provisions and standing on 24-hour and then 48-hour alert into July 1942. Drydocked on 1–2 July so that her bottom could be scraped, cleaned and painted, the cruiser completed her availability on 6 July and then resumed a busy schedule of gunnery practice with drone targets, high-speed sleds, and in shore bombardment in the Hawaiian operating area.

On 15 July 1942, &quot;Atlanta&quot;, again in TF 16, sailed for Tongatapu. Anchoring at Nukuʻalofa, Tonga on 24 July, where she fueled and then took on fuel from &quot;Mobilube&quot;, the light cruiser pushed on later the same day and overtook TF 16. On 29 July, as all preparations proceeded for the invasion of Guadalcanal, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was assigned to TF 61.

Screening the carriers as they launched air strikes to support the initial landings on 7–8 August, &quot;Atlanta&quot; remained there until the withdrawal of the carrier task forces on 9 August. For the next several days, she remained at sea, replenishing when necessary while the task force operated near the Solomons.

===Battle of the Eastern Solomons===
As the Americans consolidated their gains on Guadalcanal, the critical need for reinforcements prompted Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to send the Combined Fleet south to cover a large troop convoy. American scout planes spotted the Japanese forces on the morning of 23 August. With the enemy reported to the northwest, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and launched search and attack planes, but they failed to make contact because of deteriorating weather and the fact that the Japanese, knowing that they had been spotted, reversed course.

Throughout the day on 24 August, &quot;Atlanta&quot; received enemy contact reports and screened &quot;Enterprise&quot; as she launched a strike group to attack the Japanese carriers. The sighting of an enemy &quot;snooper&quot; at 1328 sent &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s sailors to general quarters, where they remained for the next 5 hours. At 1530, the cruiser worked up to as TF 16 stood roughly north-northwestward &quot;to close [the] reported enemy carrier group.&quot; At 1637, with unidentified planes approaching, &quot;Atlanta&quot; went to . &quot;Enterprise&quot; then launched a strike group shortly thereafter, completing the evolution at 1706.

In the meantime, the incoming enemy bombers and fighter aircraft from and prompted the task force to increase speed to . Shortly after &quot;Enterprise&quot; completed launching her own aircraft, the Japanese raid, estimated by Captain Jenkins to consist of at least 18 Aichi D3A1 &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers, came in from the north northwest at 1710. Over the next 11 minutes, &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s ,  and 20 mm batteries contributed to the barrage over &quot;Enterprise&quot;, as the light cruiser conformed to &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s every move as she maneuvered violently to avoid the dive bombers.

Despite the heavy antiaircraft fire, &quot;Enterprise&quot; took one hit and suffered some shrapnel damage from an estimated five near hits. Captain Jenkins later reported that his ship may have shot down five of the attackers. &quot;Atlanta&quot; was not damaged in the engagement.

Reporting to TF 11 for duty the following day, &quot;Atlanta&quot; operated with that force, redesignated TF 61 on 30 August, over the next few days. When torpedoed &quot;Saratoga&quot; on 31 August, the light cruiser screened the stricken flagship as rigged a towline and began taking her out of danger. The force ultimately put into Tongatapu on 6 September, where &quot;Atlanta&quot; provisioned ship, fueled from , and enjoyed a period of upkeep.

Underway on 13 September, the light cruiser escorted and on 15 September. After seeing her charges safely to their destination at Dumbea Bay, Nouméa, on 19 September, &quot;Atlanta&quot; fueled, took on stores and ammunition, and sailed on 21 September as part of Task Group 66.4 (TG 66.4). Becoming part of TF 17 on 23 September, the light cruiser was detached the following day to proceed in company with , and to Tongatapu, which she reached on 26 September.

Underway with those same ships on 7 October, &quot;Atlanta&quot; briefly escorted Guadalcanal-bound transports from 11 to 14 October, before putting into Espiritu Santo for fuel on the afternoon of the 15th. Assigned then to Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee&#x27;s TF 64, the ship sailed after dark that same day to resume operations covering the ongoing efforts to secure Guadalcanal. Returning briefly to Espiritu Santo for fuel, stores and provisions, the warship stood out from Segond Channel on the afternoon of 23 October.

Two days later, with a Japanese Army offensive having failed to eject the Americans from Guadalcanal, Admiral Yamamoto sent the Combined Fleet south in an attempt to annihilate the American naval forces doggedly supporting the marines. &quot;Atlanta&quot; operated in TF 64, along with &quot;Washington&quot;, , and two destroyers, as the opposing forces engaged in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October. That day, &quot;Atlanta&quot; patrolled astern of the fueling group supporting the two American carrier task forces. On 27 October, when attacked TF 64, the force maneuvered at high speed to clear the area.

On the morning of 28 October, &quot;Atlanta&quot; brought on board Rear Admiral Norman Scott from &quot;San Francisco&quot;, and became the flagship of the newly designated TG 64.2. After fueling from &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Atlanta&quot;, screened by four destroyers, headed northwest to shell Japanese positions on Guadalcanal. Reaching the waters off Lunga Point on the morning of 30 October, &quot;Atlanta&quot; embarked Marine liaison officers at 0550, and then steamed west, commencing her bombardment of Point Cruz at 0629 while the destroyers formed a column astern. Provoking no return fire, TG 64.2 accomplished its mission and returned to Lunga Point, where &quot;Atlanta&quot; disembarked the liaison officers. She then proceeded, in company with her screen, to Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on the afternoon of 31 October.

===Naval Battle of Guadalcanal===
====Convoy escort====

&quot;Atlanta&quot; served as Admiral Scott&#x27;s flagship as the light cruiser, accompanied by four destroyers, escorted , and to Guadalcanal. The cruiser and her consorts continued to screen those ships, designated TG 62.4, as they lay off Lunga Point on 12 November unloading supplies and disembarking troops.

At 0905, the task group received a report that nine bombers and 12 fighters were approaching from the northwest, and would reach their vicinity at about 0930. At about 0920, &quot;Atlanta&quot; led the three auxiliaries to the north in column, with the destroyers spaced in a circle around them. 15 minutes later, nine &quot;Vals&quot; from emerged from the clouds over Henderson Field, the American airstrip on Guadalcanal. The American ships opened fire soon after, putting up a barrage that downed &quot;several&quot; planes. Fortunately, none of the primary targets of the attack, &quot;Zeilin&quot;, &quot;Libra&quot; and &quot;Betelgeuse&quot;, suffered more than minor damage from several close calls, though &quot;Zeilin&quot; sustained some flooding. The three auxiliaries returned to the waters off Lunga Point as soon as the attack ended and resumed working cargo and disembarking troops.

A little over an hour later, at 1050, &quot;Atlanta&quot; received word of another incoming Japanese air raid. 15 minutes later, &quot;Atlanta&quot; led the three auxiliaries north with the destroyers in a circle around the disposition. The &quot;bogeys&quot;, 27 Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Bettys&quot; from Rabaul, closed, sighted bearing west by north, approaching from over Cape Esperance in a very loose &quot;V&quot; formation. Although the destroyers opened fire, the planes proved to be out of range and the ships checked fire. The &quot;Bettys&quot;, for their part, ignored the ships and continued on to bomb Henderson Field. Upon the disappearance of the planes, TG 62.4 resumed unloading off Lunga Point.

On 12 November, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was still off Lunga Point, screening the unloading, as part of TF 67 under Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan in &quot;San Francisco&quot;. At about 1310, &quot;Atlanta&quot; received a warning that 25 enemy planes were headed for Guadalcanal, slated to arrive within 50 minutes. The light cruiser went to general quarters at 1318 and received the signal &quot;prepare to repel air attack...&quot;

Within six minutes, &quot;Atlanta&quot; and the other combatants of the support group formed a screen around the transport group (TG 67.1), and the two groups steamed north together at . At about 1410, the Americans sighted the incoming raid, consisting of what appeared to be 25 twin-engined bombers (&quot;Bettys&quot;) which broke up into two groups after clearing Florida Island, and came in at altitudes that ranged from . opened fire at 1412. &quot;Atlanta&quot; did so a minute later, training her guns at planes headed for the gap in the screen between &quot;San Francisco&quot; and . &quot;Atlanta&quot; claimed to have shot down two &quot;Bettys&quot;, just after they dropped their torpedoes, at about 1415, only three minutes before the attack ended. Once the last Japanese plane had been splashed, the work of unloading the transports and cargo ships resumed. One &quot;Betty&quot;, crippled by antiaircraft fire, crashed into the after superstructure of &quot;San Francisco&quot;, inflicting the only damage on the force.

====Night attack====
The abrupt end of the air attack gave &quot;Atlanta&quot; and her colleagues only a brief respite, however, for trouble approached from yet another quarter. A Japanese surface force, made up of two battleships, one cruiser and six destroyers, was detected steaming south toward Guadalcanal to shell Henderson Field. Admiral Callaghan&#x27;s support group was to &quot;cover [the retiring transports and cargo vessels] against enemy attack.&quot; TG 67.4 departed Lunga Point about 1800 and steamed eastward through Sealark Channel, covering the withdrawal of TG 67.1. An hour before midnight, Callaghan&#x27;s ships reversed course and headed westward.

&quot;Helena&quot;″s radar picked up the first contact at a range of . As the range closed, &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s surface search radar, followed by her gunnery radars, picked up a contact on the enemy ships.

Admiral Callaghan&#x27;s order for a course change caused problems almost at once, as &quot;Atlanta&quot; had to turn to port (left) immediately to avoid a collision with one of the four destroyers in the van, the latter having apparently executed a &quot;ships left&quot; rather than &quot;column left&quot; movement. As &quot;Atlanta&quot; began moving to resume her station ahead of &quot;San Francisco&quot;, the illuminated the light cruiser. &quot;Atlanta&quot; shifted her main battery to fire at the enemy destroyer, opening fire at a range of about and, along with other US ships that concentrated on &quot;Akatsuki&quot;″s searchlights, overwhelmed the destroyer.

As two other Japanese destroyers crossed her line, &quot;Atlanta&quot; engaged both with her forward mounts, while her aft mounts continued to blast away at the illuminated ship. An additional, unidentified assailant also opened up on the light cruiser from the northeast. At about that time, at least one torpedo plowed into &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s forward engine room from the port side, fired almost certainly by either or (&quot;Akatsuki&quot;″s destroyer consorts). &quot;Atlanta&quot; lost all but auxiliary diesel power, suffered the interruption of her gunfire, and had to shift steering control to the steering engine room aft. Meanwhile, &quot;Akatsuki&quot; drifted out of the action and soon sank with heavy loss of life. Michiharu Shinya, &quot;Akatsuki&quot;″s Chief Torpedo Officer, one of her few survivors, was rescued the next day by US forces and spent the rest of the war in a New Zealand prisoner of war camp. He later stated unequivocally that &quot;Akatsuki&quot; had &quot;not&quot; been able to fire &quot;any&quot; torpedoes that night before being overwhelmed by gunfire.

Soon after being torpedoed, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was then hit by an estimated nineteen 8-inch (203 mm) shells when &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;in the urgency of battle, darkness, and confused intermingling of friend or foe&quot;, fired into her. Though almost all of the shells passed through the thin skin of the ship without detonating, scattering green dye, fragments from their impact killed many men, including Admiral Scott and members of his staff. &quot;Atlanta&quot; prepared to return fire on her new assailant, but &quot;San Francisco&#x27;s&quot; own gun flashes disclosed a distinctly &quot;non-Japanese hull profile&quot; that resulted in a suspension of those efforts. &quot;San Francisco&#x27;s&quot; shells, which passed high through &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s&quot; superstructure, may have been intended for a Japanese target further beyond her from &quot;San Francisco&#x27;s&quot; perspective.

After the fire ceased, &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s Captain Jenkins took stock of the situation, and, having only a minor foot wound, made his way aft to Battle II. His ship was badly battered, largely powerless, down by the head and listing slightly to port, and a third of his crew was dead or missing. As the battle continued, the light cruiser&#x27;s men began clearing debris, jettisoning topside weight to correct the list, reducing the volume of sea water in the ship, and succoring the many wounded.

====Sinking====
Daylight revealed the presence nearby of three burning American destroyers, the disabled &quot;Portland&quot;, and the abandoned hulk of , which &quot;Portland&quot; summarily dispatched with three salvoes. &quot;Atlanta&quot;, drifting toward the enemy-held shore east of Cape Esperance, dropped her starboard anchor, and her captain sent a message to &quot;Portland&quot; explaining the light cruiser&#x27;s condition. Boats from Guadalcanal came out to take her most critically wounded. By mid-morning, all of those had been taken off the ship.

 arrived at 09:30 on 13 November, took &quot;Atlanta&quot; under tow, made harder by the cruiser&#x27;s still lowered anchor, and headed toward Lunga Point. During the voyage, a &quot;Betty&quot; bomber neared the disposition, and one of the two surviving mounts—which was powered by a diesel generator—fired and drove it off. The other manually-rotated mount could not be trained on the target in time.

&quot;Atlanta&quot; reached Kukum about 14:00, at which point Captain Jenkins conferred with his remaining officers. As Jenkins, who was later awarded a Navy Cross for his heroism during the battle, later wrote, &quot;It was by now apparent that efforts to save the ship were useless, and that the water was gaining steadily.&quot; Even had sufficient salvage facilities been available, he allowed, the severe damage she had taken would have made it difficult to save the ship. Authorized by Commander, South Pacific Forces, to act at his own discretion regarding the destruction of the ship, Jenkins ordered that &quot;Atlanta&quot; be abandoned and sunk with a demolition charge.

Accordingly, all remaining men except the captain and a demolition party boarded Higgins boats sent out from Guadalcanal for the purpose. After the charge had been set and exploded, the last men left the battered ship. Ultimately, at 20:15 on 13 November 1942, &quot;Atlanta&quot; sank west of Lunga Point in about 400 ft (120 m) of water. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 January 1943. One hundred seventy of her men were killed and 103 were wounded.

====Exploration of the wreck====
The wreck of USS &quot;Atlanta&quot; was discovered in 1992 by an expedition led by Dr. Robert Ballard using a remotely operated underwater vehicle, (ROV). Dr. Ballard was famous for leading the expeditions that discovered and the . Unfortunately, strong ocean currents and poor visibility prevented the expedition from thoroughly exploring &quot;Atlanta&quot;. In 1994, two Australian technical divers Rob Cason and Kevin Denlay traveled to Solomon Islands with the intention of being the first scuba divers to dive &quot;Atlanta&quot; but this was unsuccessful because of the lack of a suitable surface support vessel and strong surface currents; this was also the first mixed gas scuba diving expedition to Guadalcanal. However, they did manage to dive one of the two other deepest diveable wrecks; the Japanese transport &quot;Azumasan Maru&quot;, which is almost deep at the stern. Many other World War II wrecks discovered by Dr. Ballard in Iron Bottom Sound are beyond the current technical limit for scuba and are only accessible by ROVs or submersibles. Dr Ballard gives an account of this in his book &quot;The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal&quot;. In 1995 Denlay returned with American Terrance Tysall - with the specific intention of diving USS &quot;Atlanta&quot; - and one of their &#x27;work-up dives&#x27; was on the &quot;Sasako Maru&quot;, one of the other deepest diveable wrecks at the time, which is over in the collapsed debris field of the bridge. They then went on to make the first successful scuba dive on USS &quot;Atlanta&quot;, which was at the time the deepest wreck dive by free swimming divers in the southern hemisphere.

In the following years, Denlay and Tysall mounted several larger expeditions to survey &quot;Atlanta&quot;, exploring and videoing the wreck in detail to a depth of at the bow. The civil unrest in Solomon Islands from late 1998 prevented further diving around Guadalcanal for several years. However, on the final expedition that year, the then deepest wreck dive by a woman was made by Kevin&#x27;s wife, Mirja, on &quot;Atlanta&quot;. Denlay&#x27;s last visit to the wreck was in 2002 using a closed circuit rebreather or CCR, the first CCR dive on &quot;Atlanta&quot;. Since then, very few dives have been conducted on &quot;Atlanta&quot;, although in May 2011 a very experienced deep diving team from &quot;Global Underwater Explorers&quot; successfully videoed the wreck for documentary purposes, the first survey of the wreck since Denlay&#x27;s expeditions up to 1998.
A dive conducted in April 2024 by Bruce Clulow and Peter Taw found the hull and bow of the Atlanta had completely collapsed just forward of the number one 5 inch gun.

==Awards==
&quot;Atlanta&quot; was awarded five battle stars for her World War II service and a Presidential Unit Citation for her &quot;heroic example of invincible fighting spirit&quot; in the battle off Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942.

<text>St. Gallen is a Swiss city and the capital of the canton of St. Gallen. It evolved from the hermitage of Saint Gall, founded in the 7th century. Today, it is a large urban agglomeration (with around 167,000 inhabitants in 2019) and represents the center of eastern Switzerland. Its economy consists mainly of the service sector. The city is home to the University of St. Gallen, one of the best business schools in Europe.

The main tourist attraction is the Abbey of Saint Gall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Abbey&#x27;s renowned library contains books from the 9th century. The official language of St. Gallen is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of Alemannic Swiss German. The city has good transport links to the rest of the country and to neighbouring Germany and Austria. It also functions as the gate to the Appenzellerland.

==History==

===Early history===

The town of St. Gallen grew around the Abbey of St Gall, founded in the 8th century. The abbey is said to have been built at the site of the hermitage of Irish missionary Gallus, who according to legend had established himself by the river Steinach in AD 612. The monastery itself was founded by Saint Othmar in . The abbey prospered in the 9th century and became a site of pilgrimage and a center of trade, with associated guest houses, stables and other facilities, a hospital, one of the first monastery schools north of the Alps. By the tenth century, a settlement had grown up around the abbey.

In 926 Magyar raiders attacked the abbey and surrounding town. Saint Wiborada, the first woman formally canonized by the Vatican, reportedly saw a vision of the impending attack and warned the monks and citizens to flee. While the monks and the abbey treasure escaped, Wiborada chose to stay behind and was killed by the raiders.
Between 924 and 933 the Magyars again threatened the abbey, and its books were removed for safekeeping to Reichenau. Not all the books were returned.

On 26 April 937 a fire consumed much of the abbey, spreading to the adjoining settlement. However, the library was spared. Muslim slave-raiders attacked the abbey in 939. About 954 a protective wall was raised around the abbey. By 975, Abbot Notker finished the wall, and the adjoining settlement began growing into the town of St. Gall.

===Independence from the Abbey===
From the later 12th century, the town of St. Gall increasingly pushed for independence from the abbey. In 1180, an imperial reeve, who was not answerable to the abbot, was installed in the town.
In 1207, Abbot Ulrich von Sax was granted the rank of Imperial Prince (&quot;Reichsfürst&quot;) by Philip of Swabia, King of the Germans. As an ecclesiastical principality, the Abbey of St. Gallen was to constitute an important territorial state and a major regional power in northern Switzerland.

The city of St. Gallen proper progressively separated itself from the rule of the abbot. Abbot Wilhelm von Montfort in 1291 granted special privileges to the citizens. By about 1353 the guilds, headed by the cloth-weavers guild, had gained control of the civic government. In 1415 the city bought its liberty from the German king Sigismund.

===Ally of the Swiss Confederacy===
In 1405, the Appenzell estates of the abbot successfully rebelled and in 1411 they became allies of the Old Swiss Confederation. A few months later, the town of St. Gallen also became an ally. They joined the &quot;everlasting alliance&quot; as full members of the Confederation in 1454 and in 1457 became completely free from the abbot.

However, in 1451 the abbey became an ally of Zürich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus who were all members of the Confederation.

Ulrich Varnbüler was an early mayor of St. Gallen. Hans, the father of Ulrich, was prominent in city affairs in St. Gallen in the early 15th century. Ulrich entered public affairs in the early 1460s and attained the various offices and honours that are available to a talented and ambitious man. He demonstrated fine qualities as field commander of the St. Gallen troops in the Burgundian Wars.

In the Battle of Grandson (1476) his troops were part of the advance units of the Confederation and took part in their famous attack. A large painting of Ulrich returning triumphantly to a hero&#x27;s welcome in St. Gallen is still displayed in St. Gallen.

After the war, Varnbüler often represented St. Gallen at the various parliaments of the Confederation. In December 1480, Varnbüler was offered the position of mayor for the first time. From that time on, he served in several leadership positions and was considered the city&#x27;s intellectual and political leader.

According to Vadian, who understood his contemporaries well, &quot;Ulrich was a very intelligent, observant, and eloquent man who enjoyed the trust of the citizenry to a high degree.&quot;

His reputation among the Confederates was also substantial. However, in the late 1480s, he became involved in a conflict that was to have serious negative consequences for him and for the city.
In 1463, Ulrich Rösch had assumed the management of the abbey of Saint Gall. He was an ambitious prelate, whose goal was to return the abbey to prominence by every possible means, following the losses of the Appenzell War.

His restless ambition offended the political and material interests of his neighbours. When he arranged for the help of the Pope and the Emperor to carry out a plan to move the abbey to Rorschach on Lake Constance, he encountered stiff resistance from the St. Gallen citizenry, other clerics, and the Appenzell nobility in the Rhine Valley, who were concerned for their holdings.

At this point, Varnbüler entered the conflict against the prelate. He wanted to restrain the increase of the abbey&#x27;s power and at the same time increase the power of the town that had been restricted in its development. For this purpose he established contact with farmers and Appenzell residents (led by the fanatical Hermann Schwendiner) who were seeking an opportunity to weaken the abbot.

Initially, he protested to the abbot and the representatives of the four sponsoring Confederate cantons (Zürich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus) against the construction of the new abbey in Rorschach. Then on 28 July 1489 he had armed troops from St. Gallen and Appenzell destroy the buildings already under construction, an attack known as the Rorschacher Klosterbruch.

When the Abbot complained to the Confederates about the damage and demanded full compensation, Ulrich responded with a countersuit, and in cooperation with Schwendiner rejected the arbitration efforts of the non-partisan Confederates. He motivated the clerics from Wil to Rorschach to abandon their loyalty to the abbey and spoke against the abbey at a meeting of the townspeople at Waldkirch, where the popular league was formed. He was confident that the four sponsoring cantons would not intervene with force, due to the prevailing tensions between the Confederation and the Swabian League. He was strengthened in his resolve when the people of St. Gallen re-elected him as their highest magistrate in 1490.

===Invasion of 1490===
Ulrich Varnbüler had made a serious miscalculation. In early 1490, the four cantons decided to carry out their duty to the abbey and to invade the St. Gallen canton with an armed force. The people of Appenzell and the local clerics submitted to this force without significant resistance, while the city of St. Gallen braced itself for a fight to the finish. However, when they learned that their compatriots had given up the fight, they lost confidence, and they agreed to a settlement that greatly restricted the city&#x27;s power and burdened the city with serious penalties and reparation payments.

Ulrich, overwhelmed by the responsibility for his political decisions, panicked in the face of the approaching enemy who wanted him apprehended. His life was in great danger, and he was forced to escape from the city disguised as a messenger. He made his way to Lindau and to Innsbruck and the court of King Maximilian. The victors confiscated those of his properties that lay outside of the city of St. Gallen and banned him from the Confederation. Ulrich then appealed to the imperial court (as did Schwendiner, who had fled with him) for the return of his property.

The suit had the support of Friedrich II and Maximilian and the trial threatened to drag on for years: it was continued by Ulrich&#x27;s sons Hans and Ulrich after his death in 1496, and eventually the Varnbülers regained their properties. However, other political ramifications resulted from the court action, because the Confederation gained ownership of the city of St. Gallen and rejected the inroads of the empire. Thus, the conflict strengthened the relationship between the Confederation and the city of St. Gallen. On the other hand, the matter deepened the alienation between Switzerland and the German Holy Roman Empire, which eventually led to a total separation after the Swabian War.

Despite the unpropitious end of his career, Ulrich Varnbüler is immortalized in a famous woodcut by Albrecht Dürer, which is now part of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s woodcut collection in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.

Among Varnbüler&#x27;s sons, the eldest (Hans/Johann) became the mayor of Lindau. He is the patriarch of the Baden and Württemberg Varnbülers.

===Reformation===
Starting in 1526 then-mayor and humanist Joachim von Watt (Vadian) introduced the Protestant Reformation into St. Gallen. The town converted to the new religion while the abbey remained Roman Catholic. While iconoclastic riots forced the monks to flee the city and remove images from the city&#x27;s churches, the fortified abbey remained untouched. The abbey would remain a Catholic stronghold in the Protestant city until 1803.

===Modern history===
In 1798 the French invaded Switzerland, destroying the Ancien Régime. Under the Helvetic Republic both the abbey and the city lost their power and were combined with Appenzell into the Canton of Säntis. The Helvetic Republic was widely unpopular in Switzerland and was overthrown in 1803. Following the Act of Mediation the city of St. Gallen became the capital of the Protestant Canton of St. Gallen.

One of the first acts of the new canton was to suppress the abbey. The monks were driven from the abbey; the last abbot died in Muri in 1829. In 1846 a rearrangement in the local dioceses made St. Gall a separate diocese, with the abbey church as its cathedral and a portion of the monastic buildings designated the bishop&#x27;s residence.

Gustav Adolf IV, former king of Sweden, spent the last years of his life in St. Gallen, and died there in 1837.

In the 15th century, St. Gallen became known for producing quality textiles. In 1714, the zenith was reached with a yearly production of 38,000 pieces of cloth. The first depression occurred in the middle of the 18th century, caused by strong foreign competition and reforms in methods of cotton production. But St. Gallen recovered and an even more prosperous era arrived.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the first embroidery machines were developed in St. Gallen. In 1910 the embroidery production constituted the largest export branch (18% of the total export value) in Switzerland and more than half of the worldwide production of embroidery originated in St. Gallen. One fifth of the population of the eastern part of Switzerland was involved with the textile industry. However, World War I and the Great Depression caused another severe crisis for St. Gallen embroidery. Only in the 1950s did the textile industry recover somewhat. Nowadays, because of competition and the prevalence of computer-operated embroidery machines, only a reduced textile industry has survived in St. Gallen; but its embroidered textiles are still popular with Parisian haute couture designers.

==Geography and climate==
===Topography===
St. Gallen is situated in the northeastern part of Switzerland in a valley about above sea level. It is one of the highest cities in Switzerland and thus receives abundant winter snow. The city lies between Lake Constance and the mountains of the Appenzell Alps (with the Säntis as the highest peak at ). It therefore offers excellent recreation areas nearby.

As the city center is built on an unstable turf ground (its founder Gallus was looking for a site for a hermitage, not for a city), all buildings on the valley floor must be built on piles. For example, the entire foundation of the train station and its plaza are based on hundreds of piles.

St. Gallen has an area, , of . Of this area, 27.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while 28.2% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 42.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (1.9%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes).

===Climate===
St. Gallen has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with short, warm summers and long, moderately cold winters. Precipitation is very high year round. St. Gallen has a very cloudy climate.

Between 1981 and 2010 St. Gallen had an average of 141 days of rain or snow per year and on average received of precipitation. The wettest month was July during which time St. Gallen received an average of of rain. During this month there was precipitation for an average of 13.8 days. The months with the most days of precipitation were May, June and July. The driest month of the year was February with an average of of precipitation over 9.1 days.

===Radioactivity===
St. Gallen is notable for reporting the highest maximum radioactivity measurements of any Swiss city, as published in the 2009 yearly report by the Federal Office of Public Health. While the daily average level of gamma-ray radioactivity in the city is unremarkable at 105 nSv/h, the maximum can reach 195 nSv/h, as high as the average for Jungfraujoch, the location with the highest reported level of radioactivity in Switzerland, due to its high elevation and therefore greater exposure to cosmic rays. The same report explains that the unusually high spikes of radioactivity measured in St. Gallen are due to radioactive products of radon gas being washed to the ground during heavy storms, but does not explain where the sufficient quantities of radon gas and its products to account for the anomaly would come from. The yearly report for 2009 on risks associated with radon published by the same governmental agency shows St. Gallen to lie in an area of the lowest level of radon exposure. In addition to the measured gamma-radiation, the city may be subject to radioactive tritium pollution in Teufen, a satellite town situated 4 km south of the city in the canton of Appenzell Outer Rhodes (this pollution is also covered in the report).

==Culture and sightseeing==

After the years of Gallus&#x27; death, the place became one of the centers of Germanic culture. This is because of the creative works of the monks who followed the footsteps of the city&#x27;s founder Gallus. This resulted to numerous heritage sites of national significance of the country.

==== By rail and tram ====

St. Gallen railway station is part of the national Swiss Federal Railways network and has InterCity connections to Zürich and the Zurich Airport every half-hour. St. Gallen is the hub for many private railways such as the Südostbahn (SOB), connecting St. Gallen with Lucerne, the Appenzeller Bahnen, which operates the Appenzell–St. Gallen–Trogen railway, connecting to Appenzell and Trogen, and also serves as a tram in downtown.

==== By bus ====
The city has a dense local bus system, including the city&#x27;s trolleybus network, which is operated by the VBSG and is well established on the valley floor, but less so on the hills. As St. Gallen is located near the Appenzell mountain area, it offers also many Postauto (post bus) connections. The agglomeration also has its own St. Gallen S-Bahn system (overground local trains).

==== Expansion - St. Gallen 2013 ====

The &quot;St. Gallen 2013&quot; project aimed to improve local rail services, with infrastructure upgrades and new rolling stock. By December 2013, S-Bahn services would run on six lines, at intervals of 15 to 30 minutes.

<doc id="403905" wikidata="Q743783" url="?curid=403905" title="Leo II, King of Armenia">
<text>Leo II or Leon II (occasionally numbered Leo III; , &quot;Levon II&quot;; c. 1236 – 1289) was king of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, ruling from 1269/1270 to 1289. He was the son of King Hetoum I and Queen Isabella and was a member of the House of Lampron.

==Early life==

Leo was born in 1236, the son of King Hetoum I and Queen Isabella. Hetoum and Isabella&#x27;s marriage in 1226 had been forced on them by Hetoum&#x27;s father Constantine of Baberon, who had cleared the way for Hetoum by arranging the murder of Queen Isabella&#x27;s first husband. They had six children, of which Leo was the eldest. One of his sisters was Sibylla of Armenia, who was married to Bohemond VI of Antioch to bring peace between Armenia and Antioch.

In 1262, Leo married Keran (Kir Anna), the daughter of Prince Hetoum of Lampron. Thus, he solidified himself as a member of the House of Lampron.

In 1266, while their father king Hetoum I was away to visit the Mongol court, Leo and his younger brother Thoros fought to repel a massive army of Mamluk invaders, at the Battle of Mari. Thoros was killed in combat, and Leo was captured and imprisoned. Following the disaster, the cities of Adana, Tarsus, and Ayas were assaulted and the capital of Sis was sacked and burnt. Thousands of Armenians were massacred and 40,000 taken captive. When King Hetoum returned, he paid a large ransom to retrieve his son, including a large quantity of money, handing over several fortresses, and accepting to intercede with the Mongol ruler Abagha in order to have one of Baybars&#x27;s relatives freed.

==Reign==

Hetoum I abdicated in 1269 in favour of his son, and entered the Franciscan order. He died a year later. The new king Leo II was known as a pious king, devoted to Christianity. He pursued active commercial relations with the West, by renewing trade agreements with the Italians and establishing new ones with the Catalans. He also endeavoured to reinforce the Mongol alliance, as his father Hetoum I had submitted Armenia to Mongol authority in 1247.

In 1271, Marco Polo visited the Armenian harbour of Ayas and commented favourably about Leo&#x27;s reign and the abundance of the country, although he mentions his military forces were rather demoralized:

In 1275, the Mamluk sultan Baybars invaded Cilicia for a second time. The following year, Armenia fought off an invasion by the Turkoman tribes, but the Constable Sempad, Leo&#x27;s uncle, was killed in combat.

===Mongol alliance===

In 1281, Leo joined the Mongols in their invasion of Syria, but they were vanquished at the Second Battle of Homs. Leo had to sue for peace, and in 1285 obtained a 10-year truce in exchange for important territorial concessions in favour of the Mamluks.

Leo died in 1289 from arsenic, and was succeeded by his son Hetoum II.

==Descendants==
During twenty-one years of marriage Leo had sixteen children by his wife Keran, ten sons and six daughters. Five of his children reached the throne. The eldest, Hethum II of Armenia, abdicated after four years in favor of his younger brother Thoros III of Armenia, but was placed back on the throne in 1294. In 1296, their brother Sempad of Armenia blinded Hetoum and in 1298 he strangled Thoros, in order to seize power. Sempad was then overthrown in 1298 by their younger brother Constantine I of Armenia, who was replaced by older brother Hethum II, who then abdicated in 1305 in favor of Thoros III&#x27;s son Leo III of Armenia, who was murdered in 1307 with his uncle Hethum II at the hands of the Mongol general Bilarghu, being succeeded by one of the youngest surviving children of Leo and Keran, Oshin of Armenia. Eventually, the inheritance of the Armenian Kingdom was passed to the descendants of Leo and Keran&#x27;s eldest surviving daughter Isabella of Armenia, wife of Amalric of Lusignan, Lord of Tyre.

<text>The International Pentecostal Church of Christ (or IPCC) is a Wesleyan/Pentecostal organization formed in 1976 by the merger of two Pentecostal organizations. In 1907, Gaston B. Cashwell, called the &quot;Apostle of Pentecost in the South&quot;, founded a periodical called &quot;The Bridegroom&#x27;s Messenger&quot;, in Atlanta, Georgia. About the same time, Paul and Hattie Barth started a church. The Barths became editors of &quot;The Bridegroom&#x27;s Messenger&quot;. In 1918, they began &quot;Beulah Heights Bible School&quot; in Atlanta, and in 1921 they organized an association that became the &quot;International Pentecostal Assemblies&quot;. John Stroup, a member of the Methodist Protestant Church, professed receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1908. Stroup was one of the first individuals to take the Pentecostal message into southern Ohio and parts of Kentucky. He organized the &quot;Pentecostal Church of Christ&quot; in Flatwoods, Kentucky in 1917. The body originally headquartered in Ashland, Kentucky, and later in London, Ohio. In 1976, the &quot;International Pentecostal Assemblies&quot; and the &quot;Pentecostal Church of Christ&quot; merged to become the International Pentecostal Church of Christ. Headquarters are located in London, Ohio. The church operates a youth camp, and the Global Missions Department, the National Youth Department and Women&#x27;s Ministries. Doctrines are detailed in a 19-article Statement of Faith ranging from the inspiration of the Scriptures to tithes and offerings. The IPCC is one of a few Pentecostal and Evangelical denominations to elevate the issue of racism to their statement of faith. The church holds two ordinances - water baptism by immersion, and holy communion. The denomination has two practices that are encouraged within the local church - foot washing, and child dedication. The body is Trinitarian and, like many Pentecostal bodies, holds that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of Baptism with the Holy Spirit. Its affiliations are with the Pentecostal/Charismatic Churches of North America, Pentecostal World Conference, a charter member of the National Association of Evangelicals, and the World Evangelical Fellowship. In 2003, the denomination had 4,961 members in 67 churches. Nearly half of its congregations are located in Ohio. The rest are concentrated primarily in Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina. By 2010, the IPCC had dropped to 3,756 members in 62 churches.

<doc id="403925" wikidata="Q4861946" url="?curid=403925" title="Barnstable (village), Massachusetts">
<text>Barnstable is the name of one of the seven villages within the Town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, United States. The Village of Barnstable is located on the north side of the town, centered along &quot;Old King&#x27;s Highway&quot; (Massachusetts Route 6A), and houses the County Complex of Barnstable County, a small business district, a working harbor, and several small beaches. The village is home to many small attractions, including Sturgis Library, the Olde Colonial Courthouse (now &quot;Tales of Cape Cod&quot;), the Barnstable Comedy Club, and the Trayser Museum.

== Attractions ==
The village is arguably the most historic village in Barnstable; it holds the homes of M. Hinkley, D.G. Bacon, F.D. Cobb, and several other homes dating from the mid-19th century. The area also holds the renowned Cummaquid Golf Club, the Barnstable Comedy Club and the Trayser Museum.

=== Sturgis Library ===
The Sturgis Library was constructed in 1644 for the Reverend John Lothrop, founder of Barnstable. The building is one of the oldest houses remaining on Cape Cod. The house which forms the original part of the library is the oldest building housing a public library in the United States. Since Reverend Lothrop used the front room of the house for public worship, another distinction of the Sturgis Library is that it is the oldest structure still standing in America where religious services were regularly held. This room is now called &quot;The Lothrop Room&quot; and contains a beamed ceiling and pumpkin-colored wide-board floors that exemplify the quintessential early character of authentic Cape Cod houses.

=== Olde Colonial Courthouse ===
The Olde Colonial Courthouse is one of the oldest courthouses in the United States. Built of wood, court proceedings of the King&#x27;s Court were interrupted in 1774 by James Otis, Samuel Adams and 1,500 other protestors opposed to the King&#x27;s bill of attainder that denied the right of colonists to a jury trial. As a result, the King&#x27;s judge decided to cease holding cases. It served as a state courthouse until 1838. This courthouse in now a museum and hosts the &quot;Tales of Cape Cod&quot;, a local tourist attraction.

=== Barnstable Comedy Club ===
The Barnstable Comedy Club is the oldest and longest-running community theater in Massachusetts. 

=== Trayser Museum ===
The Trayser Museum is the former county custom house, which now houses a Coast Guard Heritage Museum. Also on the grounds of the museum is a jail, complete with inmates&#x27; graffiti. The jail dates back to 1690. 

=== Barnstable Village ===
Barnstable Village is also home to the Crocker Tavern, which was built around 1754 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Crocker Tavern served as a stagecoach stop, an inn, and an important meeting place into the mid-19th century. Cornelius Crocker, one of the wealthiest men on the Cape, was the first keeper of the tavern. Under the stewardship of Crocker, the inn became the central meeting place for American patriots including James Otis prior to, and during, the Revolutionary War.

== In popular culture ==
In his collection of short stories, &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot;, author Kurt Vonnegut references Barnstable Village on more than one occasion. Vonnegut and his family lived in Barnstable, in a house overlooking Barnstable Harbor, from 1951 to 1971.

<doc id="403931" wikidata="Q6546185" url="?curid=403931" title="Light horse field ambulance">
<text>A light horse field ambulance was an Australian World War I military unit whose purpose was to provide medical transport and aid to the wounded and sick soldiers of an Australian Light Horse brigade. Light horse field ambulance units served in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as part of the Australian Army Medical Corps.

Typically a Lieutenant Colonel commanded each ambulance. All officers of the ambulance were medical doctors or surgeons. Dental units were often attached to the ambulance as well.

An ambulance consisted of two sections, the Mobile and the Immobile. The Mobile Section travel with its brigade into combat, where it would establish a Dressing Station. It use stretchers or carts to retrieve the wounded and transport them to the Dressing Station. The Immobile Section established and operated a Receiving Station, which received the wounded the Dressing Station sent on. The ambulance&#x27;s surgeons would operate on the wounded at the Receiving Station. From the Receiving Station, the sick and wounded would go first to the Casualty Clearing Station and ultimately to a Base Hospital.

== Transport ==
The light horse field ambulances operated during the Gallipoli campaign and in the Middle East theatre: Egypt, the Sinai peninsula, Palestine and Syria. The methods used to transport the wounded had to operate effectively in the sandy, dusty environment.

; Stretcher: As in infantry field ambulances, stretchers were used for transport over short distances, rough terrain or when enemy fire prevented the safe employment of bearer animals.

; Cycle stretcher: These were unpopular and ineffective; after the Gaza battles the forces abandoned the use of cycle stretchers.

; Sand cart: The mainstay of the transport section was the sand cart. It featured wide steel rims and was designed be able to carry three stretchers over soft sand. Six horses or mules provided the motive power. The sand cart was poorly suited to operating on the hard, rough ground of Palestine and Syria, and breakdowns were frequent.

; Sand sledge: Used to transport one stretcher case over sand; two horses pulled the sledge.
; Light ambulance wagon: Drawn by a four horse team, the light ambulance wagon was designed by Surgeon Colonel W.D.C. Williams. Wagons of this type were taken to Egypt by some of the field ambulance units during the early days of World War I.

; Camel cacolet: The camel cacolet was used to carry wounded over long distances on rough terrain impassable to wheeled transport. There were two types of cacolet: the sitting and the lying down type. One camel would carry two patients, one on either side of the camel&#x27;s hump.

== Units during World War I ==
Three Australian light horse field ambulance units remained in active service throughout WWI. Additional units were established and disbanded at several points during the war. By the end of WWI, the AIF had five light horse field ambulances in active service.
== WWI Military awards and decorations ==
Military decorations were awarded to a number of WWI personnel serving in the Australian light horse field ambulance units. Although the light horse field ambulance units were part of the AIF, decorations were awarded under the British system of honours as Australia&#x27;s system of honours would not be established until 1975.

<doc id="403933" wikidata="Q574717" url="?curid=403933" title="USS Attu">
<text>USS &quot;Attu&quot; (CVE-102) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after the Battle of Attu in the Aleutian Islands and was built for service during World War II. Launched in May 1944, and commissioned in June, she served as a transport carrier, ferrying aircraft, and as a replenishment carrier, supporting the Invasion of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in June 1946, and sold for scrapping in January 1947. After a failed acquisition attempt by the Jewish Agency, she was ultimately scrapped in 1949.

==Design and description==
&quot;Attu&quot; was a &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft.

One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more.

==Construction==
Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. She was ordered under the name &quot;Elbour Bay&quot; (a misspelling of &quot;Elbow Bay&quot;), as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was renamed &quot;Attu&quot;, after the Battle of Attu, on 6 November 1943, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent Casablanca-class carriers after naval or land engagements. The escort carrier was laid down on 16 March 1944, MC hull 1139, the forty-seventh of a series of fifty &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers. She was launched on 27 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. George W. Steele; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 30 June 1944, with Captain Henry Fahnestock MacComsey in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===

Upon being commissioned, &quot;Attu&quot; underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. On 7 August, she departed San Diego, transporting aircraft and passengers to Pearl Harbor. She then took on another load of aircraft and personnel, and proceeded west, making stops at Guadalcanal and Espiritu Santo. Upon finishing her transport run, she got underway on her return trip on 31 August. She arrived at San Diego on 13 September, where overhaul was conducted. On 28 September, she sailed north to Alameda, California, where she loaded fuel, supplies, and replenishment aircraft.

She departed the West Coast on 1 October, bound for Finschhafen, New Guinea, arriving there on 18 October. She then stopped at Seeadler Harbor in Manus Island, before returning via Pearl Harbor back to Alameda. She departed yet again on 23 November, bound for Pearl Harbor. Upon arriving, she began ferrying supplies and troops between Pearl Harbor and Guam. She finished her duties and returned to San Diego on 4 January 1945. After a short period of rest, she sailed again on 20 January, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 27 January. There, she conducted gunnery exercises in the waters off of Oahu. She concluded her exercises and steamed for Enewetak Atoll on 1 February. Pausing briefly, she proceeded onwards to Ulithi. On 16 February, she departed Ulithi, and was assigned to Task Group 50.8.4 (Logistics Support Group), along with the escort carriers , , and . This task group was responsible for ferrying and transferring replenishment aircraft to the frontline Fifth Fleet and its carriers, which were supporting the Invasion of Iwo Jima.
After transferring all of her aircraft, &quot;Attu&quot; returned to Guam for replacement of her aircraft and supplies. She then sailed westwards again, and served as a replenishment carrier again, this time in support of the landings on Okinawa. This time, her task group was responsible for resupplying both the escort carriers and the fleet carriers operating over the island. On 4 June, were being refueled by tankers, east of Okinawa. Throughout the day, winds began to pick up, and refueling operations had ceased by the time tropical storm force winds were reported in the late afternoon. In fact, &quot;Attu&quot;″s task group was directly in the path of Typhoon Connie, which was proceeding northwards. As Admiral William Halsey Jr., the commander of the Third Fleet, got word of the typhoon, his orders ended up driving a large part of his fleet directly into the path of the incoming storm. Amazingly, Halsey had previously blundered his way into Typhoon Cobra, with much damage and loss of life, in December 1944. As part of the Logistics Support Group, &quot;Attu&quot; witnessed the worst of the damage, weathering the eyewall of the storm.

As night fell, it became evident that the task group could not avoid encountering the typhoon. The storm&#x27;s eyewall struck on the early morning of 5 June, and by 3:30, hurricane-force winds had already been reported. At around 4:00, some flags tore off &quot;Attu&quot;, and wrapped around her radarscope, rendering her blind to the location of the other ships around her. Consequently, she only narrowly avoided, with careful manipulation of the engines, a collision with the tankers. Her crew noted that the bow once came as close as to a catastrophic collision with a tanker&#x27;s stern. The typhoon&#x27;s winds blew several aircraft on board her flight deck off her side, and rendered inoperational or otherwise damaged many more. As she passed through the eye of the storm, the crew managed to unfurl the flags blocking her radar, enabling her to pass through the second half of the storm without much further damage.

On 10 June, Captain Paul Hubert Ramsey took over command of the vessel. In early July, she retired back to San Diego for much belayed repairs of her typhoon damage. On 24 July, with repairs quickly concluded, she steamed westwards. She was sailing through a fueling area in the West Pacific when news of the Japanese surrender broke.

===Post-war===
Following the end of the war, she sailed back to California, arriving on 11 November. On 25 November, she joined the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She cruised around the Pacific, making stops and returning U.S. servicemen back to the mainland. She completed her &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duties, and was discharged in early 1946.

By May 1946, &quot;Attu&quot; was slated for disposal by the Navy. She sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, passing through the Panama Canal and making a stop at Jacksonville, Florida. She was decommissioned on 8 June, and she was struck from the Navy list on 3 July.

After &quot;Attu&quot; was decommissioned, she was acquired by representatives of the Jewish Agency in New York. The representatives, led by Yehuda Arazi, planned to use the ship to transport up to 10,000 Jews to Palestine, where they wanted to establish a Jewish state. In addition, they planned to utilize the carrier to ferry a large quantity of armaments for the Haganah, the paramilitary precursor of what would become the Israeli Defense Forces in 1948. An initial payment of about $10,000 () was arranged, and a refit was scheduled to prepare the ship. However, the United States Department of State discovered the plan and cancelled the deal; this allowed &quot;Attu&quot; to be scrapped in 1949. &quot;Attu&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>Christmas pudding is sweet, dried-fruit pudding cake traditionally served as part of Christmas dinner in Britain and other countries to which the tradition has been exported. It has its origins in medieval England, with early recipes making use of dried fruit, suet, breadcrumbs, flour, eggs and spice, along with liquid such as milk or fortified wine. Later, recipes became more elaborate. In 1845, cookery writer Eliza Acton wrote the first recipe for a dish called &quot;Christmas pudding&quot;.

The dish is sometimes known as plum pudding (though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving dried fruit). The word &quot;plum&quot; was used then for what has been called a &quot;raisin&quot; since the 18th century, and the pudding does not contain plums in the modern sense of the word.

==Basics==
Some households have their own recipes for Christmas pudding, which may be handed through families for generations. Essentially the recipe brings together what traditionally were expensive or luxurious ingredients — notably the sweet spices that are so important in developing its distinctive rich aroma, and usually made with suet. The pudding is very dark, almost black in appearance due to the dark sugars and black treacle in most recipes, and its long cooking time. The mixture can be moistened with the juice of citrus fruits, brandy and other alcohol (some recipes call for dark beers such as mild, stout or porter).

Prior to the 19th century, the English Christmas pudding was boiled in a pudding cloth, and often represented as round. The Victorian era fashion involved putting the mixture into a basin and then steaming it, followed by unwrapping the pudding, placing it on a platter, and decorating the top with a sprig of holly.

Initial cooking usually involves steaming for many hours. Most pre-twentieth century recipes assume that the pudding will then be served immediately, but in the second half of the twentieth century, it became more usual to reheat puddings on the day of serving, and recipes changed slightly to allow for maturing. To serve, the pudding is reheated by steaming once more, and may be dressed with warm brandy which is set alight. It can be eaten with hard sauce (usually brandy butter or rum butter), cream, lemon cream, ice cream, custard, or sweetened béchamel, and is sometimes sprinkled with caster sugar.

==History==
===Legends===
There is a popular myth that plum pudding&#x27;s association with Christmas goes back to a custom in medieval England that the &quot;pudding should be made on the 25th Sunday after Trinity, that it be prepared with 13 ingredients to represent Christ and the 12 apostles, and that every family member stir it in turn from east to west to honour the Magi and their journey in that direction&quot;. However, recipes for plum puddings appear mainly, if not entirely, in the 17th century and later. One of the earliest plum pudding recipes is given by Mary Kettilby in her 1714 book &quot;A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery&quot;. There is a popular and wholly unsubstantiated myth that in 1714, George I of Great Britain (sometimes known as the Pudding King) requested that plum pudding be served as part of his royal feast in his first Christmas in England.

===Ancestors===
Christmas pudding&#x27;s possible ancestors include savoury puddings such as those in Harley MS 279, croustades, , creme boiled (a kind of stirred custard), and sippets. Various ingredients and methods of these older recipes appear in early plum puddings. An early example of a bag pudding (without fruit) is &quot;fraunche mele&quot; in the Liber Cure Cocorum Pudding &quot;had the great merit&quot; of not needing to be cooked in an oven, something &quot;most lower class households did not have&quot;. Pudding predecessors often contained meat, as well as sweet ingredients, and prior to being steamed in a cloth the ingredients may have been stuffed into the gut or stomach of an animal, like haggis or sausages.

As techniques for meat preserving improved in the 18th century, the savoury element of both the mince pie and the plum pottage diminished as the sweet content increased. People began adding dried fruit and sugar. The mince pie kept its name, though the pottage was increasingly referred to as &quot;plum pudding&quot;. As plum pudding, it became widespread as a feast dish, not necessarily associated with Christmas, and usually served with beef. It makes numerous appearances in 18th century satire as a symbol of Britishness, including the Gilray cartoon, &quot;The Plumb-pudding in danger&quot;.

===Victorian era===
It was not until the 1830s that a boiled cake of flour, fruits, suet, sugar and spices, all topped with holly, made a definite appearance, becoming more and more associated with Christmas. In her bestselling 1845 book &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot;, the East Sussex cook Eliza Acton was the first to refer to it as &quot;Christmas Pudding&quot;.

===British Empire===

The custom of eating Christmas pudding was carried to many parts of the world by British colonists. It is a common dish in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. Throughout the colonial period, the pudding was a symbol of unity throughout the British Empire, which the message was widely promoted through the media.

In 1927, the Empire Marketing Board (EMB) wrote a letter to the Master of the Royal Household, requesting a copy of the recipe used to make the Christmas pudding for the royal family. The King and Queen granted Leo Amery, the head of the EMB, permission to use the recipe in a publication in the following November. The royal chef, Henry Cédard, provided it. In order to distribute the recipe, the EMB had to overcome two challenges: size and ingredients. First, the original recipe was measured to serve 40 people, including the entire royal family and their guests. The EMB was challenged to rework the recipe to serve only 8 people. Second, the ingredients used to make the pudding had to be changed to reflect the ideals of the Empire. The origins of each ingredient were carefully manipulated to represent some of the Empire&#x27;s many colonies. Brandy from Cyprus and nutmeg from the West Indies, which had been inadvertently forgotten in previous recipes, made special appearances. However, there were a number of colonies that produced the same foodstuffs. The final recipe included Australian currants, South African stoned raisins, Canadian apples, Jamaican rum and English Beer, among other ingredients all sourced from somewhere in the Empire. After finalising the ingredients, the royal recipe was sent out to national newspapers and to popular women&#x27;s magazines. Copies were also printed and handed out to the public for free. The recipe was a phenomenal success, as thousands of requests for the recipe flooded the EMB office.

In 1931, an annual Christmas market for the People&#x27;s Dispensary for Sick Animals was held at the Royal Albert Hall on 24 and 25 November. A 10-ton Christmas pudding, the largest ever created up until that time, was featured. The recipe became known as the &quot;Prince of Wales&#x27; Empire Christmas Pudding&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper noted &quot;The Lord Mayor of London has promised to give the pudding its first &#x27;stir&#x27;. He will be followed by the High Commissioners of the Dominions, and afterwards the general public will have the chance of stirring it&quot;. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) was then a patron of the PDSA charity. It was then divided up into 11,208 smaller puddings, which were distributed amongst the poor throughout the country. Manchester and Salford, for example, received 512 each.

===United States===
In America, the tradition of the Christmas pudding had already arrived in pre-independence days. A book entitled &quot;The Williamsburg Art of Cookery&quot; by Helen Bullock was published in the U.S. as early as 1742. Among the ingredients she includes a pound of each of a variety of dried fruits and sugar, plus half a pound each of candied peel (citron, orange and lemon). She also adds one pint of brandy and 12 eggs. 

Jane Cunningham Croly published a 19th-century recipe for plum pudding contributed to &quot;Jennie June&#x27;s American Cookery Book&quot; by the American poet sisters Alice Cary and Phoebe Cary. It was made as bread pudding, by soaking stale bread in milk then adding suet, candied citron, nutmeg, eggs, raisins and brandy. It was a moulded dessert, cooked in boiling water for several hours, and served with a sweet wine sauce.

==Wishing and other traditions==

It was in the late Victorian era that &#x27;Stir up Sunday&#x27; (the fifth Sunday before Christmas) began to be associated with the making of Christmas pudding. The collect this Sunday in the Church of England&#x27;s &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; begins with the words &quot;Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful people; that they, plenteously bringing forth the fruit of good works...&quot;. This led to the custom of preparing Christmas puddings on that day which became known as Stir-up Sunday, associated with the stirring of the Christmas pudding.

Initially probably a schoolchild joke, latterly the day became known as &quot;Stir-up Sunday&quot;. By the 1920s, the custom was established that everyone in the household, or at least every child (and sometimes the servants), gave the mixture a stir and made a wish while doing so.

It was common practice to include small silver coins in the pudding mixture, which could be kept by the person whose serving included them. The usual choice was a silver threepence or a sixpence. The coin was believed to bring wealth in the coming year, and came from an earlier tradition of putting tokens in a cake, which had died out by the twentieth century (see Twelfth Cake).

Other tokens are also known to have been included, such as a tiny wishbone (to bring good luck), a silver thimble (for thrift) or an anchor (to symbolise safe harbour).

Once turned out of its basin, decorated with holly, doused in brandy (or occasionally rum), and flamed (or &quot;fired&quot;), the pudding is traditionally brought to the table ceremoniously, and greeted with a round of applause. In 1843, Charles Dickens describes the scene in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;:

Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone – too nervous to bear witnesses – to take the pudding up and bring it in... Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook&#x27;s next door to each other, with a laundress&#x27;s next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered – flushed, but smiling proudly – with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.

==Career==
Postrel was editor-in-chief of &quot;Reason&quot; from July 1989 to January 2000, and remained on the masthead as editor-at-large through 2001. Prior to that, she was a reporter for &quot;Inc.&quot; and the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. She currently serves on the board of directors of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). From 2000 to 2006, she wrote an economics column for the &quot;New York Times&quot; and from 2006 to 2009 she wrote the &quot;Commerce and Culture&quot; column for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. She also appeared on the last episode of the third season of Penn and Teller&#x27;s &quot;Bullshit!&quot;.

Postrel wrote the biweekly column &quot;Commerce &amp; Culture&quot; for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; until April 2011. Since May 2011, she has written a biweekly column for &quot;Bloomberg View&quot;.

She is best known for her non-fiction books including &quot;The Future and Its Enemies&quot; and &quot;The Substance of Style&quot;. In the former she explains her philosophy, &quot;dynamism&quot;, a forward-looking and change-seeking philosophy that generally favors unregulated organization through &quot;spontaneous order&quot;. She contrasts it with &quot;stasis&quot;, a philosophy that favors top-down control and regulation and is marked by desire to maintain the present state of affairs. In November 2013, she published a third book, &quot;The Power of Glamour&quot;, which defined glamour as &quot;nonverbal rhetoric&quot; that &quot;leads us to feel that the life we dream of exists, and to desire it even more.&quot; And, in November 2020, she published her fourth book, &quot;The Fabric of Civilization&quot;. This book looks at the &quot;history of innovation, science, technology, trade, and human history in general&quot; through the lens of the global development of textiles.

==Health care, bioethics, and aesthetics==
Postrel has written several articles on health care and bioethics, including accounts of her own experiences.

In March 2006 Postrel donated a kidney to an acquaintance, writer Sally Satel. She has recounted the experience, and referred to it in several subsequent articles and blog posts, many of which are critical of legal prohibitions against compensating organ donors. In some of the pieces, she discusses strategies for working around these restrictions, such as organ donor transplant chains.

In her March 2009 article &quot;My Drug Problem&quot; in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Postrel wrote about her own experience of being treated for breast cancer with the expensive drug Herceptin. She questioned if such a costly treatment would be available to others and if the risky research that makes such innovative treatments possible would be profitable under the proposed health care reforms in the United States.

Postrel has also referred to her experience as a cancer patient in her writing about the importance of design aesthetics in hospitals and the competitive forces that drive them to create more attractive environments for patients. This ties into the thesis of her second book, that beauty is more than simply a superficial, frivolous trait and can go more than skin deep. Notions of beauty and desirability, and thoughts on what makes good design good beyond the needs of sound engineering, informed her work at the &quot;Deep Glamour&quot; blog.

<text>Dhaka Division () is an administrative division of Bangladesh. Dhaka serves as the capital city of the Dhaka Division, the Dhaka District and Bangladesh. The division remains a population magnet, covers an area of 20,508.8 km2 with a population in excess of 44 million, it is one of the fastest growing populous administrative division of the world, growing at 1.94% rate since prior count, compared with national average of 1.22%. However, national figures may include data skewing expatriation of male labor force as gender ratio is skewed towards females.

Dhaka Division borders every other division in the country except Rangpur Division. It is bounded by Mymensingh Division to the north, Barisal Division to the south, Chittagong Division to the east and south-east, Sylhet Division to the north-east, and Rajshahi Division to the west and Khulna Divisions to the south-west.

== Etymology ==
The origins of the name Dhaka are uncertain. It may derive from the &quot;dhak&quot; tree, which was once common in the area, or from Dhakeshwari, the &#x27;patron goddess&#x27; of the region. Another popular theory states that Dhaka refers to a membranophone instrument, &quot;dhak&quot; which was played by order of Subahdar Islam Khan I during the inauguration of the Bengal capital in 1610.

Some references also say it was derived from a Prakrit dialect called Dhaka Bhasa; or Dhakka, used in the Rajtarangini for a watch station; or it is the same as Davaka, mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta as an eastern frontier kingdom. According to Rajatarangini written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana, the region was originally known as &quot;Dhakka&quot;. The word &quot;Dhakka&quot; means &quot;watchtower&quot;. Bikrampur and Sonargaon—the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was most likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose.

==History==
The history of urban settlements in the area of modern-day Dhaka dates to the first millennium. The Greater Dhaka region was under the kingdom of Vanga and Gangaridai in ancient period. The region was part of the ancient division of Bikrampur, which was ruled by the Sena dynasty. The ancient city of Bikrampur in Dhaka was also one of the capitals of Palas, Chandras, Varmans and Devas. The ancient city of Dholsamudra in present-day Gazipur served as one of the capitals of the Buddhist Pala Empire. In the sixth century, forts were built in Toke and Ekdala which continued to be used as late as the Mughal Period. Chinashkhania was the capital of the Chandalas and Shishu Pal had his capital in modern-day Sreepur, which the ruins of can still be seen today. Another fort was built in Dardaria in 1200. Under Islamic rule, the centre moved to the historic district of Sonargaon, the regional administrative hub of the Delhi and the Bengal Sultanates.

At the end of the Karrani Dynasty (1564–1575), the nobles of Bengal became fiercely independent. Sulaiman Khan Karrani carved out an independent principality in the Bhati region comprising a part of greater Dhaka district and parts of Mymensingh district. During that period Taj Khan Karrani and another Afghan chieftain helped Isa Khan to obtain an estate in Sonargaon and Mymensingh in 1564. By winning the grace of the Afghan chieftain, Isa Khan gradually increased his strength and status and by 1571, the Mughal Court designated him as the ruler of Bhati. Mughal histories, mainly the &quot;Akbarnama&quot;, the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; and the &quot;Baharistan-i-Ghaibi&quot; refers to the low-lying regions of Bengal as &quot;Bhati.&quot; This region includes the Bhagirathi to the Meghna River is Bhati, while others include Hijli, Jessore, Chandradwip and Barisal Division in Bhati. Keeping in view the theatre of warfare between the Baro-Bhuiyans and the Mughals, the Baharistan-i-Ghaibi mentions the limits of the area bounded by the Ichamati River in the west, the Ganges in the south, the Tripura to the east; Alapsingh pargana (in present Mymensingh District) and Baniachang (in greater Sylhet) in the north. The Baro-Bhuiyans rose to power in this region and put up resistance to the Mughals, until Islam Khan Chisti made them submit in the reign of Jahangir. Throughout his reign Isa Khan put resistance against Mughal invasion. It was only after his death, when the region went totally under Mughals. Isa Khan was buried in the village of Bakhtarpur.
Dhaka became the capital of the Mughal province of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1610 with a jurisdiction covering modern-day Bangladesh and eastern India, including the modern-day Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. This province was known as Bengal Subah. The city was founded during the reign of Emperor Jahangir. Emperor Shah Jahan visited Dhaka in 1624 and stayed in the city for a week, four years before he became emperor in 1628. Dhaka became one of the richest and greatest cities in the world during the early period of Bengal Subah (1610-1717). The prosperity of Dhaka reached its peak during the administration of governor Shaista Khan (1644-1677 and 1680–1688). Rice was then sold at eight maunds per rupee. Thomas Bowrey, an English merchant sailor who visited the city between 1669 and 1670, wrote that the city was 40 miles in circuit. He estimated the city to be more populated than London with 900,000 people.

Bengal became the economic engine of the Mughal Empire. Dhaka played a key role in the proto-industrialisation of Bengal. It was the centre of the muslin trade in Bengal, leading to muslin being called &quot;daka&quot; in distant markets as far away as Central Asia. Islam Khan I was the first Mughal governor to reside in the city. Khan named it &quot;Jahangir Nagar&quot; (&quot;The City of Jahangir&quot;) in honour of the Emperor Jahangir. The name was dropped soon after the English conquered. Dhaka became home to one of the richest elites in Mughal India.

Under the Nawabs of Bengal, the Naib Nazim of Dhaka was in charge of the city. The Naib Nazim was the deputy governor of Bengal. He also dealt with the upkeep of the Mughal Navy. The Naib Nazim was in charge of the Dhaka Division, which included Dhaka, Comilla, and Chittagong. Dhaka Division was one of the four divisions under the Nawabs of Bengal. The Nawabs of Bengal allowed European trading companies to establish factories across Bengal. The region then became a hotbed for European rivalries. The British moved to oust the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757, who was allied with the French. Due to the defection of Nawab&#x27;s army chief Mir Jafar to the British side, the last Nawab lost the Battle of Plassey.

In the northern part of the Dhaka division, Bhawal Estate was a large zamindari in Bengal (in modern-day Gazipur, Bangladesh) until it was abolished according to &quot;East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950&quot;. In the late 17th century, Daulat Ghazi was the zamindar of the Ghazi estate of Bhawal. Bala Ram was Diwan of Daulat Ghazi. In 1704, as the consequence of change in the policy of revenue collection, Bala Ram&#x27;s son Sri Krishna was installed as the zamindar of Bhawal by Murshid Quli Khan. Since then, through acquisitions the zamindari expanded. The family turned into the proprietor of the whole Bhawal pargana after purchasing the zamindari of J. Wise, an indigo grower for Rs 4,46,000. In 1878, British Raj conferred &quot;Raja&quot; title to Zamindar Kalinarayan Roy Chowdhury who oversaw the Bhawal estate. At its peak, the estate comprised over 1,500 square kilometer, which included 2,274 villages and around 55,000 villagers.

On the southern side the notable township was Fatehabad located by a stream known as the Dead Padma, which was from the main channel of the Padma River. Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah established a mint in Fatehabad during his reign in the early 15th century. Fatehabad continued to be a mint town of the Bengal Sultanate until 1538. In Ain-i-Akbari, it was named as &quot;Haweli Mahal Fatehabad&quot; during the reign of Emperor Akbar in the Mughal Empire. The Portuguese cartographer João de Barros mentioned it as &quot;Fatiabas&quot;. The Dutch map of Van den Brouck described it as &quot;Fathur&quot;. By the 19th century, the town was renamed as Faridpur in honour of the Sufi saint Shah Fariduddin Masud, a follower of the Chishti order of Ajmer. Haji Shariatullah and Dudu Miyan led the conservative Faraizi movement in Faridpur during the early 19th century. The Faridpur District was established by the British in 1786. The Faridpur Subdivision was a part of Dacca Division in the Bengal Presidency established by the East India Company. The municipality of Faridpur was established in 1869. The subdivision covered modern day Faridpur, Rajbari, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Gopalganj districts (collectively known as Greater Faridpur). It was included in Eastern Bengal and Assam during the British Raj between 1905 and 1912.
During the Indian mutiny of 1857, Dhaka witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army. Direct rule by the British crown was established following the successful quelling of the mutiny. It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the city&#x27;s political and social elite. In 1885, the Dhaka State Railway was opened with a 144 km metre gauge (1000 mm) rail line connecting Mymensingh and the Port of Narayanganj through Dhaka. The city later became a hub of the Eastern Bengal State Railway. The electricity supply began in 1901.

Dhaka&#x27;s fortunes changed in the early 20th century. British neglect of Dhaka&#x27;s urban development was overturned with the first partition of Bengal in 1905, which restored Dhaka&#x27;s status as a regional capital. The city became the seat of government for Eastern Bengal and Assam, with a jurisdiction covering most of modern-day Bangladesh and all of what is now Northeast India. The partition was the brainchild of Lord Curzon, who finally acted on British ideas for partitioning Bengal with a view to improving administration, education, and business. Dhaka became the seat of the Eastern Bengal and Assam Legislative Council. Dhaka was the seat of government for 4 administrative divisions, including the Assam Valley Division, Chittagong Division, Dacca Division, Rajshahi Division, and the Surma Valley Division. There were a total of 30 districts in Eastern Bengal and Assam, including Dacca, Mymensingh, Faridpur and Backergunge in Dacca Division; Tippera, Noakhali, Chittagong and the Hill Tracts in Chittagong Division; Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Rangpur, Bogra, Pabna and Malda in Rajshahi Division; Sylhet, Cachar, the Khasi and Jaintia Hills, the Naga Hills and the Lushai Hills in Surma Valley Division; and Goalpara, Kamrup, the Garo Hills, Darrang, Nowgong, Sibsagar and Lakhimpur in Assam Valley Division. The province was bordered by Cooch Behar State, Hill Tipperah and the Kingdom of Bhutan.
The development of the &quot;real city&quot; began after the partition of India. After partition, Dhaka became known as the &quot;second capital&quot; of Pakistan. This was formalized in 1962 when Ayub Khan declared the city as the legislative capital under the 1962 constitution. The economy began to industrialize. On the outskirts of the city, the world&#x27;s largest jute mill was built. The mill produced jute goods which were in high demand during the Korean War. The Intercontinental hotel, designed by William B. Tabler, was opened in 1966. Estonian-American architect Louis I. Kahn was enlisted to design the Dhaka Assembly, which was originally intended to be the federal parliament of Pakistan and later became independent Bangladesh&#x27;s parliament. The East Pakistan Helicopter Service connected the city to regional towns.

The Dhaka Stock Exchange was opened on 28 April 1954. The first local airline Orient Airways began flights between Dhaka and Karachi on 6 June 1954. The Dhaka Improvement Trust was established in 1956 to coordinate the city&#x27;s development. The first master plan for the city was drawn up in 1959. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization established a medical research centre (now called ICDDR,B) in the city in 1960.

After independence, Following the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the country had four divisions: Chittagong Division, Dacca Division, Khulna Division, and Rajshahi Division. In 1982, the English spelling of the Dacca Division (along with the name of the capital city) was changed into Dhaka Division. In the 1990s and 2000s, Dhaka experienced improved economic growth and the emergence of affluent business districts and satellite towns. Between 1990 and 2005, the city&#x27;s population doubled from 6 million to 12 million. There has been increased foreign investment in the city, particularly in the financial and textile manufacturing sectors.

==Administrative divisions==

Dhaka Division consisted before 2015 of four city corporations, 13 districts, 123 upazilas and 1,248 union parishads. However, four of the most northerly of the 17 districts were removed in 2015 to create the new Mymensingh Division, and another five districts (those situated to the south of the Ganges/Padma River) are in the process of being removed to create a new Faridpur Division.

Note: * revised area and its population after excluding the districts transferred to the new Mymensingh Division.

<text>A 502-delegate [[loya jirga]] convened in Kabul, Afghanistan, on December 14, 2003, to consider the proposed Afghan Constitution. Originally planned to last ten days, the assembly did not endorse the charter until January 4, 2004. As has been generally the case with these assemblies, the endorsement came by way of consensus rather than a vote. Afghanistan&#x27;s last constitution was drafted for the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in November 1987. 

== Drafting the Constitution ==
The Bonn Agreement of December 2001 required Afghanistan to draft and adopt a new constitution within two years. In October 2002, Interim President Hamid Karzai appointed a nine-member Constitutional Drafting Commission, chaired by Vice-President Nematullah Shahrani. Over the next six months, this body drafted a new constitution, based largely on the 1964 Afghan constitution. The initial draft, written primarily by Abdul Salam Azimi (who would become Chief Justice of Afghanistan&#x27;s Supreme Court in 2006) was not the subject of in-depth political consultation. In April 2003, Interim President Karzai passed a decree appointing a new 35-member Constitutional Commission and laying out a public consultation process. This commission travelled widely throughout the country and reworked the draft, which was not released to the public until November 2003, only weeks before the Constitutional Convention (Loya Jirga) was scheduled to begin. This process was supported by several international institutions that provided funding, mostly through the UN, and expertise.

== Selecting the Loya Jirga delegates ==

In July 2003, a Presidential Decree outlined the process for delegate selection for the Constitutional Loya Jirga (CLJ), stating that there would be 500 delegates, 344 elected by caucus at the district level, 64 women elected by caucus at the provincial level, 42 delegates from refugee, nomad, and minority communities, and 50 people (25 men, 25 women) appointed by President Karzai. The delegates included activists such as Shukria Barakzai, who campaigns for women&#x27;s rights.

== Issues addressed ==

Issues involving substantial debate included whether Afghanistan should have a presidential or parliamentary system, whether Dari or Pashto should be the official language, and whether other local languages would be recognized, whether former king Mohammed Zahir Shah should maintain the title &quot;father of the nation,&quot; how to address women&#x27;s rights, whether Afghanistan should be a free market economy, and whether higher education should be free.

The heaviest debate surrounded the question of the presidential vs. parliamentary system. Interim President Hamid Karzai supported a draft constitution the created a presidential system, which would provide one nationally elected figure who could effectively direct the executive branch. Others argued that for an ethnically diverse country coming out of years of conflict - a power-sharing model with a strong President presented the best hope for national unity and reconciliation. At one point President Karzai threatened that he would not run for the office in 2004 if a parliamentary system or semi-presidential system was created. Members of the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance accused Karzai of buying off opponents with promises of influential positions in a post-election government. On January 1, the loya jirga broke down when close to half of the assembly, consisting mostly of Uzbek, Tajik, Hazara and Turkmen minorities, boycotted the only ballot, forcing chairman Sibghatullah Mojaddedi to call for a 2-day adjourning.

Following the highly restrictive regime of the Taliban, some rights including those related to entertainment were legalized again. However, liberals in the loya jirga were strongly challenged by conservatives, many of whom supported conservative policies such as the ban of music and dancing on public television.

== Election of chairman, committees ==

The Loya jirga was convened on 14 December, beneath a large tent at the newly refurbished technical university in Kabul. In the opening ceremonies, a dozen children in various traditional costumes waved Afghan flags and sang songs of peace, including &quot;We are doves, waiting for peace, we are tired of fighting.&quot; Former king Mohammad Zahir Shah addressed the assembly. Then Mojaddedi was elected chairman, winning 252 votes, over Abdul Hafiz Mansoor&#x27;s 154. Deputies were elected, but excluded women. Many of the 114 female delegates protested at not being represented in the secretariat. To assuage their concerns, Mojaddedi appointed Safia Sediqi to the fourth deputy position and two other women as deputies&#x27; assistants.

Members of constitutional commissions, supreme court and other government officials, and members of legal and human rights commissions were allowed to attend, but not vote. Provincial governors and top-ranking police, administration, and military officials were barred from the proceedings. Delegates were divided among ten committees to consider amendments to the draft constitution, which were submitted to a reconciliation council. Powerful militia leaders had been among the groups, often dominating the process.

On the third day, Malalai Joya , a female delegate from Farah Province, was temporarily evicted, having complained that the warlords would still be in charge of the new government. Her microphone was turned off when she suggested that some of the leaders should be tried in an international court. She remained under U.N. protection for several days because of death threats. Ms. Joya aroused controversy when she condemned the allocation of positions of influence at the council to certain faction leaders, including former president Burhanuddin Rabbani and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, a deeply conservative Islamist.

== Malalai Joya&#x27;s historic speech ==

On December 17, 2003, Malalai Joya, 25, from Farah Province delivered the following speech which received wide coverage in the media internationally:

&quot;My name is Malalai Joya from Farah Province. By the permission of the esteemed attendees, and by the name of God and the colored-shroud martyrs of the path of freedom, I would like to speak for couple of minutes. 

My criticism on all my compatriots is that why are they allowing the legitimacy and legality of this Loya Jerga come under question with the presence of those felons who brought our country to this state. 

I feel pity and I feel very sorry that those who call Loya Jerga an infidel basis equivalent to blasphemy after coming here their words are accepted, or please see the committees and what people are whispering about. The chairman of every committee is already selected. Why do you not take all these criminals to one committee so that we see what they want for this nation. These were those who turned our country into the nucleus of national and international wars. They were the most anti-women people in the society who wanted to [makes pause] who brought our country to this state and they intend to do the same again. I believe that it is a mistake to test those already being tested. They should be taken to national and international court. If they are forgiven by our people, the bare- footed Afghan people, our history will never forgive them. They are all recorded in the history of our country.&quot;

==Name controversy==
Delegates collected more than the necessary 151 signatures calling for the word &quot;Islamic&quot; to be removed from the draft constitution, suggesting &quot;Republic of Afghanistan&quot; instead. Despite enough signatures, the jirga&#x27;s chairman Sibghatullah Mojaddedi refused to hold a vote and publicly called the delegates &quot;infidels&quot;, causing concern on freedom of speech.

== Ratification ==

After weeks of contentious debate, a walkout by the chair and hundreds of delegates, and dozens of amendments, the loya jirga ratified the constitution without taking a vote, but by consensus, on January 4, 2004. 

Many delegates complained that the process had no specific criteria, that the rules of procedure were not followed, and that delegates were not properly prepared or educated about the issues. There were also complaints that many of the most important decisions were made by militia and party leaders, Karzai&#x27;s favorites, and international representatives, such as U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, behind the scenes.

A documentary film, &quot;Hell of a Nation&quot;, produced and directed by Tamara Gould, Bonnie Cohen, and John Schenk, and aired on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Wide Angle&quot; series covered the Afghan constitutional process in detail.

<doc id="403951" wikidata="Q24843" url="?curid=403951" title="Greater short-toed lark">
<text>The greater short-toed lark (Calandrella brachydactyla) is a small passerine bird. The current scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus name, &quot;Calandrella&quot;, is a diminutive of &quot;kalandros&quot;, the calandra lark, and &quot;brachydactila&quot; is from &quot;brakhus&quot;, &quot;short&quot;, and &quot;daktulos&quot;, &quot;toe&quot;.

It breeds in southern Europe, north-west Africa, and across the Palearctic from Turkey and southern Russia to Mongolia. During migration they form large, tight flocks that move in unison; at other times they form loose flocks.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The greater short-toed lark was described by the German naturalist Johann Leisler in 1814 and given the binomial name &quot;Alauda brachydactila&quot;. This lark is now placed in the genus &quot;Calandrella&quot; that was established by another German naturalist, Johann Jakob Kaup, in 1829. The specific name &quot;brachydactyla&quot; is from the Ancient Greek βραχυδακτυλος &quot;brakhudaktulos&quot; &quot;short-toed&quot; from &quot;brakhus&quot; &quot;short&quot; and &quot;daktulos&quot; &quot;toe&quot;. The alternate name short-toed lark may also be used for three other species in the genus &quot;Calandrella&quot;. The Mongolian short-toed lark was formerly considered as a subspecies of the greater short-toed lark (as &quot;C. b. dukhunensis&quot;) until split in 2016 by the IOC. Formerly, some authorities also considered the red-capped lark to be either conspecific (as &quot;C. cinerea&quot;) with or a subspecies (as &quot;C. b. cinerea&quot;) of the greater short-toed lark.

=== Subspecies ===
Eight subspecies are recognized: 
* European greater short-toed lark (&quot;C. b. brachydactyla&quot;) or Palestine short-toed lark - : Found in southern Europe, on Mediterranean islands and in north-western Africa.
* Hungarian greater short-toed lark (&quot;C. b. hungarica&quot;) - : Found in Hungary and northern Serbia
* North African greater short-toed lark (&quot;C. b. rubiginosa&quot;) - : Found in northern Africa
* Levant greater short-toed lark (&quot;C. b. hermonensis&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found from southern Turkey and Syria to north-eastern Egypt. 
The syntypes of &quot;Calandrella hermonensis&quot; Tristram (Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1864, p.434), 3 adult males and a juvenile, are held in the vertebrate zoology collection of National Museums Liverpool at World Museum, with accession numbers NML-VZ T15738, NML-VZ T17770, NML-VZ T17771 and NML-VZ T17773. The specimens were collected at the foot of Mount Hermon, Lebanon in June 1864 by Canon Henry Baker Tristram. The specimens came to the Liverpool national collection through the purchase of Tristram&#x27;s collection by the museum in 1896.

* BIrelandcik greater short-toed lark (&quot;C. b. woltersi&quot;) - : Found in southern Turkey and north-western Syria
* Transcaucasian greater short-toed lark (&quot;C. b. artemisiana&quot;) - : Found from central Turkey and Transcaucasia to north-western Iran
* Steppe greater short-toed lark (&quot;C. b. longipennis&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. Also known as Eastern short-toed lark (a name also used by the Asian short-toed lark) or Yarkand short-toed lark. Found from Ukraine and southern Russia to south-central Siberia and southern Mongolia
* &quot;C. b. orientalis&quot; - : Found in central Siberia, northern Mongolia and northern China

==Description==

Several subspecies have been named but there is considerable geneflow and the species itself forms part of a larger complex. This is a small pale lark, smaller than the skylark. It is dark-streaked greyish-brown above, and white below, and has a strong pointed bill that is pinkish with a grey culmen. It has a pale supercilium, dark patches on each side of its neck and a dark tail. Some birds in the west of the range have a rufous crown. The sexes are similar. The greater short-toed lark is paler than the Mongolian short-toed lark which also has a shorter bill. In winter they fly in large and compact flocks that swing in synchrony. Care must be taken to distinguish this species from other similar &quot;Calandrella&quot; larks, such as the Mediterranean short-toed lark.

The nominate form breeds in Europe (Iberia, France, Italy, the Balkans and Romania) and winters in Africa. Subspecies &quot;hungarica&quot; breeds in the eastern parts of Europe while &quot;rubiginosa&quot; breeds in north-western Africa. Subspecies &quot;hermonensis&quot; (sometimes including &quot;woltersi&quot;) breeds in Turkey, Syria and Egypt. Subspecies &quot;artemisiana&quot; (considered by some to be synonymous with &quot;longipennis&quot;) breeds in Asia Minor and winters in southern west Asia. Subspecies &quot;longipennis&quot; breeds in Ukraine, Mongolia and Manchuria and winters in South Asia mainly in the drier zone of north-western India.

The song varies between a dry twittering and a more varied and imitative melody. Flocks will often fly together to water in the mornings at favourite spots. In the evenings they roost in open ground, with each bird squatting in a small depression made in the soil.

==Distribution and habitat==

All but some southernmost populations are migratory, wintering south to the southern edge of the Sahara and India. This species is a fairly common wanderer to northern and western Europe in spring and autumn. Populations breeding in the Iberian Peninsula winter south of the Sahara in Africa. Here they prefer crop land and dry pastures with short shrubs while the syntopic Mediterranean short-toed larks (&quot;Calandrella rufescens&quot;) prefer drier areas.

This is a common bird of dry open country and cultivation. It nests on the ground, laying two to three eggs. Its food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.

In colonial India, they were hunted for food as ortolans.

They visit parts of South Asia in large flocks during winter and are sometimes attracted to short grass areas along aerodromes and become a bird strike risk to aircraft.

== Status ==
This species is classified as Least Concern due to its extensive range and large population size. Although the population trend appears to be decreasing, the rate of decline is not considered sufficiently rapid to warrant a threatened status.

The breeding population in Europe is estimated to number 9,460,000-18,100,000 mature individuals.

<text>Henry John Heinz III (October 23, 1938 – April 4, 1991) was an American businessman and politician who served as a United States senator from Pennsylvania from 1977 until his death in 1991. An heir to the Heinz family fortune, Heinz entered politics in 1971 when he won a special election to replace Robert Corbett to represent Pennsylvania&#x27;s 18th congressional district. In 1976, Heinz ran to replace retiring Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott. Heinz narrowly won in the Republican primary over future Senator Arlen Specter and defeated William Green III in the general election. Heinz won re-election in 1982 and 1988 by large margins. On April 4, 1991, Heinz was killed when his plane, facing mechanical problems, collided with a helicopter inspecting the plane, killing all involved in the crash.

==Early life and education==
Henry John Heinz III was born on October 23, 1938, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the only child of Joan (Diehl) and H. J. &quot;Jack&quot; Heinz II, heir to the H. J. Heinz Company. His parents divorced in 1942. Heinz moved to San Francisco, California, with his mother and stepfather, U.S. Navy Captain Clayton Chot &quot;Monty&quot; McCauley. Although he was raised and primarily resided in San Francisco throughout his childhood, Heinz often spent the summer months with his father in Pittsburgh.

In 1956, Heinz graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy. He then attended and graduated from Yale University, where Theodore Stebbins was his roommate, in 1960, majoring in history, arts and letters. Heinz subsequently graduated from Harvard Business School in 1963. As a Harvard Business School student, he met his future wife, Teresa Simões Ferreira, who attended the University of Geneva, over summer break.

==Career==
===U.S. Air Force===
After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1963, Heinz served in the United States Air Force Reserve and was on active duty during the same year. He remained in the Air Force Reserve until 1969.

===Political career===
Heinz served as an assistant to Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Senator Hugh Scott and played an active role as assistant campaign manager during Scott&#x27;s campaign for re-election. Heinz then worked in the financial and marketing division of the H. J. Heinz Company between 1965 and 1970, after which he taught business at the Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Graduate School of Industrial Administration until 1971.

====U.S. House of Representatives====
In 1971, Heinz entered politics after Representative Robert Corbett, who represented Pennsylvania&#x27;s 18th congressional district, died in office. After winning the Republican primary, Heinz won the special election on November 2, 1971, to fill the vacancy created by Corbett&#x27;s death. Heinz was re-elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972 and 1974. During his tenure, he cultivated a moderate record in the vein of Pennsylvania&#x27;s two Republican senators Hugh Scott and Richard Schweikert. Also in 1974, he declined to challenge Democratic governor Milton Schapp.

====U.S. Senate====

Heinz opted not to run for re-election to his seat in the House of Representatives, announcing on December 10, 1975 to run for Pennsylvania&#x27;s open United States Senate seat created by the retirement of incumbent Hugh Scott. In the primary, Heinz faced opposition from Arlen Specter. During the campaign, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Buckley v. Valeo, allowing candidates to spend with few restrictions, benefitting Heinz. During the campaign, Heinz came under fire for having accepted illegal donations totaling $6,000 from Gulf Oil, which Heinz returned, claimed was an accident and denied legal culpability. Heinz would defeat Specter in the primary, performing strongly in western Pennsylvania. In the general election, and faced congressman William Green III in the general election. Heinz was criticized by Green for his wealth and spending. Heinz defeated Green in November. He was subsequently re-elected in 1982 and in 1988.

In the Senate, Heinz was a moderate-to-liberal Republican. He was a member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Finance, the National Commission on Social Security Reform, the National Commission on Health Care Reform, the Northeast Coalition, and the Steel Caucus. He also served as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policies, the Special Committee on Aging, and the Republican Conference Task Force on Job Training and Education.

Heinz voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Heinz voted in favor of the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.

He was elected chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for two terms, 1979–1981 and 1985–1987.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Heinz built a solid record in the Senate as &quot;a persistent defender of the nation&#x27;s growing elderly population and of the declining steel industry&quot;, that he was &quot;instrumental in pushing through legislation that put the Social Security system on sounder financial footing&quot;, and &quot;played a major role in strengthening laws regulating retirement policies, pension plans, health insurance and nursing homes&quot;, and &quot;pushed successfully for trade laws that encourage American exports and protect American products, like steel, from foreign imports&quot;.

In 1991, Heinz began evaluating a Pennsylvania gubernatorial bid, with advisors thinking it was a move towards a future bid for the White House.

==Death==

On April 4, 1991, Heinz and six other people, including two children, were killed when a Sun Co. Aviation Department Bell 412 helicopter and a Piper Aerostar, with Heinz aboard, collided in mid-air above Merion Elementary School in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. All aboard both aircraft, as well as two children at the school, were killed. The helicopter was attempting to investigate a problem with the landing gear of Heinz&#x27;s plane, and while moving in for a closer look, collided with the plane, causing both aircraft to lose control and crash. The subsequent NTSB investigation attributed the cause of the crash to poor judgment by the pilots of the two aircraft involved.

Following a funeral at Heinz Chapel in Pittsburgh and a Washington, D.C. memorial service that was attended by President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, Senator Heinz&#x27;s remains were interred in the Heinz family mausoleum in Homewood Cemetery, located in the Point Breeze neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Heinz&#x27;s long time friend, Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado, remarked: &quot;He really believed he could make the world a better place, such a contrast to the jaded resignation of our time. He could send the Senate leadership up a wall faster than anyone I&#x27;ve seen.&quot; Heinz&#x27;s son André said at the services: &quot;Dad, I am so grateful for the time we had, and I miss you and I love you.&quot;

In 1995, Teresa, Heinz&#x27;s widow, married Heinz&#x27;s Senate colleague, future Democratic presidential nominee and Secretary of State John Kerry.

== Legacy ==

The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve was renamed to the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum in Heinz&#x27;s honor following his death. The 1,200 acre (4.9 km2) refuge includes the largest remaining freshwater tidal marsh in Pennsylvania, as well as other habitats that are home to a variety of plants and animals native to Southeastern Pennsylvania.

Heinz was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1991.

In 1993, his family established the Heinz Awards, which honors individual innovation in five categories. One of the Jefferson Awards for Public Service annual awards, for &quot;Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official&quot;, is named in his honor.

Several institutions bear his name, including:
*Senator H. John Heinz III Archives at the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries in Pittsburgh
*Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh
*H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment in Washington, D.C.
*Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh
*H. J. Heinz Campus of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System in Pittsburgh

<doc id="403966" wikidata="Q727277" url="?curid=403966" title="Asian Art Museum (San Francisco)">
<text>The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco – Chong-Moon Lee Center for Asian Art and Culture is a museum in San Francisco, California that specializes in Asian art. It was founded by Olympian Avery Brundage in the 1960s and has more than 18,000 works of art in its permanent collection, some as much as 6,000 years old. Its logo is an upside down letter A, which also looks like a letter V with a line through it.

==History==
The museum origin stems from a donation to the city of San Francisco by Chicago millionaire Avery Brundage, who was a major collector of Asian art. The Society for Asian Art, incorporated in 1958, was the group that formed to gain Brundage&#x27;s collection. The museum opened in 1966 as a wing of the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park. Brundage continued to make donations to the museum, including the bequest of all his remaining personal collection of Asian art on his death in 1975. In total, Brundage donated more than 7,700 Asian art objects to San Francisco.

Despite Brundage&#x27;s professed goal of creating a &quot;bridge of understanding&quot; between the U.S. and Asia, a deeper insight into his actions revealed that he held racist, sexist, and anti-Semitic beliefs that entirely contradicted the mission and values of the museum. In 2020, the museum removed a statue of Brundage from its lobby where it had stood for five decades, and launched a thorough re-examination of his controversial legacy. Museum director Jay Xu wrote that Brundage &quot;espoused racist and anti-Semitic views.&quot;

The museum was awarded the Japanese Foreign Minister’s Commendation for their contributions to promotion of cultural exchange through art between Japan and the United States on December 1, 2020.

Jay Xu is the museum&#x27;s director.

===Relocation===
Until 2003, the museum shared a space with the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park. As the museum&#x27;s collection grew, the facilities in Golden Gate Park were no longer sufficient to display or even house the collection. In 1987 Mayor Dianne Feinstein proposed a plan to revitalize Civic Center that included relocating the museum to the Main Library. In 1995, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Chong-Moon Lee made a $15 million donation to launch the funding campaign for a new building for the museum.

During its last year in the park, it was closed for the purpose of moving to its new location. It reopened on March 20, 2003, in the former San Francisco city library building opposite of the San Francisco Civic Center, which was renovated for the purpose, under the direction of Italian architect Gae Aulenti. Lord Cultural Resources, a cultural professional practice, was also commissioned to undertake a three-part sequence of planning studies for the relocation of the museum.

The old Main library was a Beaux Arts-style building designed by George Kelham in 1917. The new $160.5 million project, designed by Gae Aulenti, introduced an indoor sky-lit court to provide a dramatic central core to the museum. Removing some interior walls, Aulenti created a sense of openness to facilitate visitor movement and the display of the artwork. The new museum increased the exhibition space by approximately 75 percent compared to the former Golden Gate Park location.

The renovation also brought a seismic upgrade scheme to the building involving base isolation. Bearings were placed over the foundation system below the building&#x27;s current slab on grade with a new basement constructed above the bearings in the process. Furthermore, the superstructure was stiffened through the addition of concrete shear walls, allowing for a rigid lateral load path for all sections of the building.

In October 2011, the museum launched a new identity. Designed by the branding agency Wolff Olins, the logo is an upside down A, representing the idea of approaching Asian art from a new perspective.

===Expansion===
In March 2016, the museum announced that it would build an additional new pavilion to its San Francisco Civic Center Building. The new pavilion will sit atop an existing, lower-level wing on the museum&#x27;s Hyde Street side; and it will add about 9,000 square feet of new space to the museum&#x27;s first floor. The expansion is expected to open by September 2019. In January 2019, Abby Chen was appointed as the Head of Contemporary Art.

==Collection==
The collection has approximately 18,000 works of art and artifacts from all major Asian countries and traditions, some of which are as much as 6,000 years old. Galleries are devoted to the arts of South Asia, Iran and Central Asia, Southeast Asia, the Himalayas, China, Korea and Japan. There are more than 2,000 works on display in the museum galleries.

The museum has become a focus for special and traveling exhibitions, including: the first major Chinese exhibition to travel outside China since the end of World War II (in 1975), an archaeological exhibition which attracted 800,000 visitors over an eight-week period, and an exhibition on wisdom and compassion opened by the Dalai Lama in 1991.

== Collection highlights ==
==Tea House==
A Japanese tea house is displayed on the second exhibition floor of the museum. This teahouse was built in Kyoto, disassembled, shipped to San Francisco and reconstructed in the museum by Japanese carpenters. The name of the tea house can be seen on a wooden plaque &quot;In the Mist&quot; located next to the Tea House on the second floor of the museum, The calligraphy on this wooden plaque is based on the calligraphy by Yamada Sobin and commissioned by Yoshiko Kakudo, the museum&#x27;s first curator of Japanese art. The Tea House was designed by architect Osamu Sato as a functioning teahouse, as well as a display case. It is a three and three-quarters (sanjo daime) mat room. It is complete with an alcove for the display of a scroll and flowers, an electric-powered sunken hearth used in winter for the hot water kettle, and a functioning preparation area (mizuya) with fresh running water and drain.

<doc id="403968" wikidata="Q60912" url="?curid=403968" title="Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria">
<text>Duchess Sophie Charlotte Auguste in Bavaria (22 February 1847 – 4 May 1897) was a granddaughter-in-law of King Louis Philippe of France, the youngest sister of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and fiancée of King Ludwig II of Bavaria.

==Life==
Sophie Charlotte was born in Munich, the residence of her paternal family, the Dukes in Bavaria. She was a daughter of Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria and the ninth of ten children born to her parents. 

===Marriage===
Upon the 1861 marriage of her elder sister Duchess Mathilde Ludovika to the Neapolitan prince Louis of the Two Sicilies, her parents looked for a suitable husband for Sophie Charlotte. Sophie then was engaged to her cousin King Ludwig II of Bavaria, and their engagement was publicised on 22 January 1867, but after having repeatedly postponed the wedding date, Ludwig finally cancelled it in October as it seemed Sophie had fallen in love with the court photographer Edgar Hanfstaengl. 
Other proposed husbands included the renowned homosexual Archduke Ludwig Viktor of Austria, brother of both Franz Joseph I of Austria and Maximilian I of Mexico, as well as the future Luís I of Portugal. Another candidate was Duke Philipp of Württemberg, the first cousin of her eventual husband.

She refused all the candidates, and was sent to stay with her aunt Amalie Auguste, then the Queen of Saxony as wife of King John. It was in Saxony Sophie Charlotte met Prince Ferdinand of Orléans, &quot;Duke of Alençon&quot;, the son of Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours and grandson of the late King Louis Philippe. Soon after, on 28 September 1868, she married him at Possenhofen Castle, near Starnberg.

===Duchess of Alençon===
She had a good relationship with her husband as well as with her sister-in-law Princess Marguerite Adélaïde of Orléans, wife of Prince Władysław Czartoryski. Her mother-in-law, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, cousin of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, had died in 1857. Sophie Charlotte did not have an overly good relationship with her father-in-law, the widowed Duke of Nemours. 

The year after their marriage, the ducal couple moved into Bushy House in the Teddington area of Southwest London, where Sophie Charlotte gave birth to her first child, Princess Louise of Orléans. 

===Later years and death===
Sophie Charlotte wrote her last will and testament on 4 October 1896, seven months before her death: she died in a fire at the Bazar de la Charité in Paris on 4 May 1897, where she had been helping to raise funds for charity. She refused to be rescued, insisting that the girls, visitors and nuns working alongside her at the bazaar be saved first. A Dominican nun who had managed to escape from the fire explained that she saw the Duchess get down on her knees and start praying.

Identifying Sophie Charlotte&#x27;s remains was not easy; her personal maid was unable to recognise the body, as it had been severely disfigured by the fire. The Duchess&#x27;s dentist, M. Lavanport, was called in. After two hours examining various bodies, he identified Sophie Charlotte on the basis of her gold fillings. Thus she became one of the first people whose remains were identified by forensic dentistry. She was buried at the Chapelle royale de Dreux.

==Issue==

* Louise Victoire Marie Amélie Sophie d&#x27;Orléans (19 July 1869 – 4 February 1952); married Prince Alfons of Bavaria and had issue. The family line ended in dynastical sense in 1990 in male line, with cognatic descendants still present.
* Philippe Emmanuel Maximilien Marie Eudes d&#x27;Orléans, &quot;Duke of Vendôme&quot; (18 January 1872 – 1 February 1931); married Princess Henriette of Belgium and had issue. The family line ended dynastically in 1970 in male line, with cognatic descendants still present.

<doc id="403971" wikidata="Q365230" url="?curid=403971" title="Janusz Kamiński">
<text>Janusz Zygmunt Kamiński (; born June 27, 1959) is a Polish cinematographer and director.

He has established a partnership with Steven Spielberg, working as a cinematographer on his films since 1993, winning the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his work on Spielberg&#x27;s holocaust drama &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and the World War II epic &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998). He has also received nominations for &quot;Amistad&quot; (1997), &quot;The Diving Bell &amp; the Butterfly&quot; (2007), &quot;War Horse&quot; (2011), &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), and &quot;West Side Story&quot; (2021). He has also received nominations for five BAFTA Awards, and six American Society of Cinematographers Awards.

In addition to his collaborations with Spielberg, he has also worked with Cameron Crowe, James L. Brooks, Julian Schnabel and John Krasinski.

Kamiński has also worked in the field of directing, first with the horror film &quot;Lost Souls&quot; (2000), and the NBC series &quot;The Event&quot; (2011) and WE TV series &quot;The Divide&quot; (2014).

In 2019, the American Society of Cinematographers included &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, both shot by Kamiński, on the list of the best-photographed films of the 20th century.

==Early life and education ==
Kamiński was born in Ziębice, Poland, the son of mother, Jadwiga Celner, and father, Marian Kamiński.

In 1981, he emigrated to the United States at the age of 21 after Prime Minister Jaruzelski imposed martial law. 

He attended Columbia College in Chicago from 1982 to 1987, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree, taking up filmmaking as a profession before attending to the AFI Conservatory, where he graduated with a Master of Fine Arts degree.

He would then take his first opportunity filming and helping direct the music video for Club of Rome’s smash hit ‘Why Can&#x27;t I Dance With Phil Donahue’.

== Career == 
He worked under cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, first as a gaffer, and eventually as second unit director of photography. He shot numerous B-movies for directors Roger Corman and Katt Shea, as well as the romantic musical comedy &quot;Cool as Ice&quot;, starring Vanilla Ice.

Kamiński was first discovered by Steven Spielberg in 1991. After seeing the television film &quot;Wildflower&quot;, Spielberg hired Kamiński to shoot &quot;Class of &#x27;61&quot;, a television film in which Spielberg served as producer.

He twice won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in the 1990s, for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. He has been nominated five additional times for &quot;Amistad&quot;, &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot;, &quot;War Horse&quot;, &quot;Lincoln&quot;, and &quot;West Side Story&quot;. In 2010, he was awarded the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal by the AFI Conservatory.

Kamiński became a member of the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC) in 1994, but resigned in 2006.

In 2018 Kamiński worried that professional cinematographers were digitally losing control of their own images. In 2010 Kamiński abandoned the Chris Curling female fighter pilot World War II project &quot;The Night Witch&quot;, and in 2012 Kamiński discussed directing a Los Angeles-based version of the drama &quot;XXXXXX&quot; but nothing became of it.

== Personal life ==
Kamiński was married to actress Holly Hunter from 1995 until 2001. In 2004, he married ABC reporter Rebecca Rankin; they divorced in 2010.

<text>The telephone desk is the smallest kind of fixed desk. Its traditional role is to provide a working surface barely large enough to write notes while speaking on the telephone, and in some cases to support the telephone or hold telephone books. In early generations of telephones the phone apparatus itself had a small desk built in. This was most common in wall mounted telephones of the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. 

The illustrations show front and side views of such an antique wall phone with a small slanted desk surface fitted with two ridges to keep paper and pencil from falling to the floor. 

The telephone desk has usually been a domestic piece of furniture. In an office a telephone would normally be placed on any form of desk, as close as possible to its users. 

Many 20th century telephone booths or call boxes had a tiny built-in desk surface for the convenience of customers. Vandalism and a higher concern for costs has led to the gradual elimination of these minuscule desk surfaces.

<doc id="403995" wikidata="Q27075424" url="?curid=403995" title="Mediterranean short-toed lark">
<text>The Mediterranean short-toed lark (Alaudala rufescens) is a small passerine bird found in and around the Mediterranean Basin. It is a common bird with a very wide range from Canary Islands north to the Iberian Peninsula and east throughout North Africa to parts of the Middle East. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;. 

Its range was also previously thought to include parts of Central Asia, and with the Mediterranean and Central Asian clades combined the species was referred to as the lesser short-toed lark. However, a 2020 study split these two populations into distinct species, with &quot;A. rufescens&quot; being the Mediterranean clade and &quot;A. heinei&quot; being the Central Asian clade. Confusingly, Hume&#x27;s short-toed lark is also sometimes called the lesser short-toed lark.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Mediterranean short-toed lark was originally described as belonging to the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. The genus name &quot;Alaudala&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;Alauda&quot;, and the specific &quot;rufescens&quot; is Latin for &quot;reddish&quot;, from &quot;rufus&quot; &quot;red&quot;. Alternate names for the lesser short-toed lark include the common short-toed lark, grey lark, rufous short-toed lark and short-toed lark. Formerly or presently, some authorities considered the Athi short-toed lark, Asian short-toed lark and/or the Somali short-toed lark to be subspecies of the lesser short-toed lark.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2020 compared the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from the sand, Asian short-toed, and Mediterranean short-toed larks. The study analysed samples from 130 individuals that represented 16 of the 18 recognised subspecies. The resulting phylogenetic tree indicated that neither the Asian short-toed lark, nor the Mediterranean short-toed lark as currently defined are monophyletic. Most of the subspecies were also found to be non-monophyletic. The authors refrained from proposing a revised taxonomy until additional studies had been completed comparing the vocalizations, sexual behaviour and ecology.

Another 2020 study found that the Mediterranean and the Central &amp; West Asian populations of &quot;A. rufescens&quot; represented two different species, the Mediterranean short-toed lark (&quot;A. rufescens&quot;) and the Turkestan short-toed lark (&quot;A. heinei&quot;). &quot;A. heinei&quot; was lifted to species status by some authorities such as the International Ornithological Congress, and 4 other subspecies originally assigned to &quot;rufescens&quot; were assigned to it instead. 

=== Subspecies ===
Five subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;A. r. rufescens&quot; - : Found on Tenerife (west-central Canary Islands)
* &quot;A. r. polatzeki&quot; - : Found in eastern Canary Islands
* &quot;A. r. apetzii&quot; - : Found in eastern and southern Iberian Peninsula
* &quot;A. r. minor&quot; - : Found from Morocco to north-western Egypt and southern Turkey to the Sinai Peninsula and eastern Iraq
* &quot;A. r. nicolli&quot; - : Found in the Nile Delta (northern Egypt)
4 other subspecies (&quot;A. r. heinei&quot;, &quot;A. r. pseudobaetica&quot;, &quot;A. r. aharonii&quot;, &quot;A. r. persica&quot;) were transferred to &quot;A. heinei&quot; when that species was split.

==Description== 
The Mediterranean short-toed lark is similar in size and appearance to the greater short-toed lark but is generally a duller-looking bird with a more streaked breast. It grows to a length of from and the sexes are similar. As with the greater short-toed lark, the colour varies across the broad range and is not a good distinguishing feature. It is dark-streaked greyish-brown above, and white below. It has a pale supercilium, and a short stubby bill.

Care must be taken to distinguish this species from the &quot;Calandrella&quot; larks. This species lacks the dark neck patches of the greater, and has fine streaking across the breast. The bill and head shape also differ, this species having a shorter, less-conical bill and a more-rounded, smaller head. The song is richer, more varied and imitative than that of its relative.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Mediterranean short-toed lark breeds in Spain, north Africa, also including Turkey eastwards across the semi-deserts of central Asia to Mongolia and China. Many populations, including the Spanish and African breeders, are sedentary (non-migratory), but some Asian birds from the north of the breeding range migrate south in winter. This species is a very rare wanderer to northern and western Europe.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This is a bird of dry open country, preferring even drier and barer soils than the greater short-toed lark. It nests on the ground, laying two or three eggs. Its food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.

<doc id="403997" wikidata="Q3109199" url="?curid=403997" title="Glossary of the French Revolution">
<text>This glossary of the French Revolution generally does not explicate names of individual people or their political associations; those can be found in List of people associated with the French Revolution.

The terminology routinely used in discussing the French Revolution can be confusing. The same political faction may be referred to by different historians (or by the same historian in different contexts) by different names. During much of the revolutionary period, the French used a newly invented calendar that fell into complete disuse after the revolutionary era. Different legislative bodies had rather similar names, not always translated uniformly into English.

==The three estates==
The estates of the realm in &quot;ancien régime&quot; France were:
*First Estate (&quot;Premièr État&quot;, &quot;le clergé&quot; ) – The clergy, both high (generally siding with the nobility, and it often was recruited amongst its younger sons) and low.
*Second Estate (&quot;Second État&quot;, &quot;la noblesse &quot;) – The nobility. Technically, but not usually of much relevance, the Second Estate also included the Royal Family.
*Third Estate (&quot;Tiers État&quot;) – Everyone not included in the First or Second Estate. At times this term refers specifically to the bourgeoisie, the middle class, but the Third Estate also included the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, the labouring class. Also included in the Third Estate were lawyers, merchants, and government officials.

Fourth Estate is a term with two relevant meanings: on the one hand, the generally unrepresented poor, nominally part of the Third Estate; on the other, the press, as a fourth powerful entity in addition to the three estates of the realm.

==Social classes==
*Royalty – House of Bourbon. Later House of Bonaparte after the Empire was established.
*Nobility (&quot;noblesse&quot;) – Those with explicit noble title. These are traditionally divided into
**&quot;noblesse d&#x27;épée&quot; (&quot;nobility of the sword&quot;), the hereditary gentry and nobility who originally had to perform military service in exchange for their titles. 
**&quot;noblesse de robe&quot; (&quot;nobility of the gown&quot;), the magisterial class that administered royal justice and civil government, often referring to those who earned a title of nobility through generations of long periods of public service (bureaucrats and civil servants) or bought it (rich merchants).
**&quot;noblesse de cloche&quot; (&quot;nobility of the bell&quot;), mayors and aldermen of certain cities under royal charter were considered gentry. Some mayors and aldermen held a noble title for life after a long period of service in office.
**&quot;Noblesse de race&quot;, (&quot;Nobility through breeding&quot;), The &quot;old&quot; nobility, who inherited their titles from time immemorial.
**&quot;Noblesse d’extraction&quot;, Nobility of &quot;seize-quartiers&quot; (&quot;sixteen Quarterings&quot;); having pure noble or gentle ancestry for four generations. 
**&quot;Noblesse de lettres&quot; (&quot;Nobility through letters patent&quot;), The &quot;new&quot; nobility, from after circa 1400 AD. 
*&quot;Ci-devant&quot; nobility (literally &quot;from before&quot;): nobility of the &quot;ancien régime&quot; (the Bourbon kingdom) after it had lost its titles and privileges.
*Bourgeoisie (literally &quot;Suburbanites&quot;) – Roughly, the non-noble wealthy and the middle classes: typically merchants, investors, and professionals such as doctors and lawyers. The dwellers in the small &quot;bourgs&quot; (&quot;walled towns and communities&quot;) outside the city.

==Constitutions==
*Liberal monarchical constitution – Adopted 6 October 1789, accepted by the King 14 July 1790.
*The Constitution of 1791 or Constitution of 3 September 1791 – Establishes a limited monarchy and the Legislative Assembly.
*The Constitution of 1793, Constitution of 24 June 1793 (&quot;Acte constitutionnel du 24 juin 1793&quot;, or Montagnard Constitution (&quot;Constitution montagnarde&quot;) – Ratified, but never applied, due to the suspension of all ordinary legality 10 October 1793.
*The Constitution of the Year III, Constitution of 22 August 1795, Constitution of the Year III, or Constitution of 5 Fructidor – Establishes the Directory.
*The Constitution of the Year VIII – Adopted 24 December 1799, establishes the Consulate.
*The Constitution of the Year X – Establishes a revised Consulate, with Napoleon as First Consul for Life.
*The Constitution of the Year XII – Establishes Bonaparte&#x27;s First Empire.

==Governmental structures==
In roughly chronological order:
*The &quot;ancien régime&quot; – The absolute monarchy under the Bourbon kings, generally considered to end some time between the meeting of the Estates-General on 5 May 1789, and the liberal monarchical constitution of 6 October 1789.
*Parlements – Royal Law courts in Paris and most provinces under the &quot;ancien régime&quot;.
*The Estates-General, also known as States-General (&quot;Etats-Généraux&quot;) – The traditional tricameral legislature of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, which had fallen into disuse since 1614. The convention of the Estates-General of 1789 is one of the events that led to the French Revolution. The Estates General, as such, met 5–6 May 1789, but reached an impasse because the Third Estate refused to continue to participate in this structure. The other two estates continued to meet in this form for several more weeks.
*The &quot;Communes&quot; – The body formed 11 May 1789, by the Third Estate after seceding from the Estates General. On 12 June 1789, the &quot;Communes&quot; invited the other orders to join them: some clergy did so the following day.
*The National Assembly (&quot;Assemblée Nationale&quot;) – Declared 17 June 1789, by the &quot;Communes&quot;. The clergy joined them June 19. This was soon reconstituted as...
*The National Constituent Assembly (&quot;Assemblée nationale constituante&quot;); also loosely referred to as the National Assembly – From 9 July 1789 to 30 September 1791, this was both the governing and the constitution–drafting body of France. It dissolved itself in favour of:
*The Legislative Assembly (&quot;Assemblée Legislative&quot;) – From 1 October 1791, to September 1792, the Legislative Assembly, elected by voters with property qualifications, governed France under a constitutional monarchy, but with the removal of the king&#x27;s veto power on 11 July 1792, was a republic in all but name, and became even more so after the subsequent arrest of the Royal Family.
*The Paris Commune – During the waning days of the Legislative Assembly and the fall of the Monarchy, the municipal government of Paris functioned, at times, in the capacity of a national government, as a rival, a goad, or a bully to the Legislative Assembly.
**Further, the Sections were directly democratic mass assemblies in Paris during the first four years of the Revolution.
*The Provisional Executive Committee – Headed by Georges Danton, this also functioned in August–September 1792 as a rival claimant to national power.
*The National Convention, or simply The convention – First met 20 September 1792; two days later, declared a republic. The National Convention after the fall of the Montagnards (27 July 1794) is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Thermidorian Convention&quot;. Three committees of the National Convention are particularly worthy of note:
**The Committee of Public Safety (&quot;Comité de salut public&quot;) – During the Reign of Terror, this committee was effectively the government of France. After the fall of the Montagnards, the committee continued, but with reduced powers.
**The Committee of General Security (&quot;Comité de sûreté générale&quot;) – Coordinated the War effort.
**The Committee of Education (&quot;Comité de l&#x27;instruction&quot;)
**The Revolutionary Tribunal (&quot;Tribunal révolutionaire&quot;) instituted in March–October 1793 to prosecute all threats to the revolutionary republic, was the effective agent of the &quot;Comité de Salut Public&#x27;s&quot; reign of terror in Paris until its dissolution on 31 May 1795.
*The Directory (&quot;Directoire&quot;) – From 22 August 1795, the convention was replaced by the Directory, a bicameral legislature that more or less institutionalized the dominance of the bourgeoisie while also enacting a major land reform that was henceforward to place the peasants firmly on the political right. The rightward move was so strong that monarchists actually won the election of 1797 but were stopped from taking power by the coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797), the first time Napoleon played a direct role in government. The Directory continued (politically quite far to the left of its earlier self) until Napoleon took power in his own right, 9 November 1799 (or 18 Brumaire), the date that is generally counted as the end of the French Revolution. The Directory itself was the highest executive organ, comprising five Directors, chosen by the Ancients out of a list elected by the Five Hundred; its legislative was bicameral, consisting of:
**The Council of Five Hundred (&quot;Conseil des Cinq-Cents&quot;), or simply the Five Hundred.
**The Council of Ancients (&quot;Conseil des Anciens&quot;), or simply the Ancients or the Senate.
*The Consulate (&quot;Consulat&quot;) – The period of the consulate (December 1799 – December 1804) is only ambiguously part of the revolutionary era. The government was led by three individuals known as Consuls. From the start, Napoleon Bonaparte served as First Consul (&quot;Premier Consul&quot;) of the Republic. In May 1802, a plebiscite made Bonaparte First Consul for Life. In May 1804 the Empire was declared, bringing the Revolutionary era to a yet more definitive end.
*The tribunat was one of the legislative chambers instituted by the Constitution of year VIII, composed of 100 members nominated by the Senate to discuss the legislative initiatives defended by the government&#x27;s Orateurs in the presence of the &quot;Corps législatif&quot;; abolished in 1807

==Political groupings==
* Royalists or Monarchists – Generally refers specifically to supporters of the Bourbon monarchy and can include both supporters of absolute and constitutional monarchy. See Reactionary.
* Jacobins – strictly, a member of the Jacobin club, but more broadly any revolutionary, particularly the more radical bourgeois elements.
* Feuillants – Members of the &quot;Club des Feuillants&quot;, result of a split within the Jacobins, who favoured a constitutional monarchy over a republic.
* Republicans – Advocates of a system without a monarch.
* The Gironde – Technically, a group of twelve republican deputies more moderate in their tactics than the Montagnards, though arguably many were no less radical in their beliefs; the term is often applied more broadly to others of similar politics. Members and adherents of the Gironde are variously referred to as &quot;Girondists&quot; (&quot;Girondins&quot;) or &quot;Brissotins&quot;
* The Mountain (&quot;Montagne&quot;) – The radical republican grouping in power during the Reign of Terror; its adherents are typically referred to as &quot;Montagnards&quot;.
* &quot;Septembriseurs&quot; – The Mountain and others (such as Georges Danton) who were on the rise in the period of the September Massacres
* Thermidorians or Thermidoreans – The more moderate (some would say reactionary) grouping that came to power after the fall of the Mountain.
* Society of the Panthéon, also known as Conspiracy of the Equals, and as the Secret Directory – faction centered around François-Noël Babeuf, who continued to hold up a radical Jacobin viewpoint during the period of the Thermidorian reaction.
* Bonapartists – Supporters of Napoleon Bonaparte, especially those who supported his taking on the role of Emperor.
* &quot;Émigrés&quot; – This term usually refers to those conservatives and members of the &quot;elite&quot; who left France in the period of increasingly radical revolutionary ascendancy, usually under implied or explicit threat from the Terror. (Generically, it can refer to those who left at other times or for other reasons.) Besides the &quot;émigrés&quot; having their property taken by the State, relatives of &quot;émigrés&quot; were also persecuted.

==&quot;Ancien régime&quot; taxes==
*&quot;Corvée&quot; – A royal or seigneurial tax, taken in the form of forced labour. It came in many forms, including compulsory military service and compulsory tillage of fields. Most commonly, the term refers to a royal &quot;corvée&quot; requiring peasants to maintain the king&#x27;s roads.
*&quot;Gabelle&quot; – A tax on salt.
*&quot;Taille&quot; – A royal tax, in principle pro capita, whose amount was fixed before collecting.
*&quot;Tithe&quot; – A tax to church.
*&quot;Aide&quot; – A tax on wine.
*&quot;Vingtième&quot; – 5 percent direct tax levied on income.
*&quot;Capitation&quot; – A poll tax.

===Cockades===
Cockades (&quot;cocardes&quot;) were rosettes or ribbons worn as a badge, typically on a hat.
*Tricolour cockade – The symbol of the Revolution (from shortly after the Bastille fell) and later of the republic. Originally formed as a combination of blue and red—the colours of Paris—with the royal white.
*Green cockade – As the &quot;colour of hope&quot;, the symbol of the Revolution in its early days, before the adoption of the tricolour.
*White cockade – Bourbon monarchy and French army.
*Black cockade – Primarily, the cockade of the anti–revolutionary aristocracy. Also, earlier, the cockade of the American Revolution.

Other countries and armies at this time typically had their own cockades.

==Religion==
*Civil Constitution of the Clergy (&quot;Constitution civile du clergé&quot;) – 1790, confiscated Church lands and turned the Catholic clergy into state employees; those who refused out of loyalty to Rome and tradition were persecuted; those who obeyed were excommunicated; partially reversed by Napoleon&#x27;s Concordat of 1801.
*Cult of Reason, &quot;La Culte de la raison&quot; – Official religion at the height of radical Jacobinism in 1793–4.
*&quot;Juror&quot; (&quot;jureur&quot;), Constitutional priest (&quot;constitutionnel&quot;) – a priest or other member of the clergy who took the oath required under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy.
*&quot;Non–juror&quot;, &quot;refractory priest&quot; (&quot;réfractaire&quot;), &quot;insermenté&quot; – a priest or other member of the clergy who refused to take the oath.

==Other terms==
*&quot;Assignats&quot; – notes, bills, and bonds issued as currency 1790–1796, based on the noble lands appropriated by the state.
*&quot;Cahier&quot; – petition, especially &quot;Cahiers de doléances&quot;, petition of grievances (literally &quot;of sorrow&quot;).
*Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (&quot;Déclaration des droits de l&#x27;homme et du citoyen&quot; – 1789; in summary, defined these rights as &quot;liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.&quot;
*Flight to Varennes – The Royal Family&#x27;s attempt to flee France June 20–21, 1791.
*The &quot;Great Fear&quot; – Refers to the period of July and August 1789, when peasants sacked the castles of the nobles and burned the documents that recorded their feudal obligations.

*&quot;Lettre de cachet&quot; – Under the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, a private, sealed royal document that could imprison or exile an individual without recourse to courts of law.
*&quot;Left&quot; and right&quot; – These political terms originated in this era and derived from the seating arrangements in the legislative bodies. The use of the terms is loose and inconsistent, but in this period &quot;right&quot; tends to mean support for monarchical and aristocratic interests and the Roman Catholic religion, or (at the height of revolutionary fervor) for the interests of the bourgeoisie against the masses, while &quot;left&quot; tends to imply opposition to the same, proto-laissez faire free marketeers and proto-communists.
*Terror – in this period, &quot;terror&quot; usually (but not always) refers to State violence, especially the so–called Reign of Terror.
*Reactionary – coined during the revolutionary era to refer to those who opposed the revolution and its principles and sought a Restoration of the monarchy.
*September Massacres – the September 1792 massacres of prisoners perceived to be counter–revolutionary, a disorderly precursor of the Reign of Terror.
*&quot;Tricoteuse&quot; (&quot;Knitter&quot;) - The term for the old ladies who would knit while watching the guillotine executions of enemies of the state. They were spies for the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; and often whipped up the crowds into a fervor.

<text>In mathematics, an algebraic equation or polynomial equation is an equation of the form formula_1, where &quot;P&quot; is a polynomial with coefficients in some field, often the field of the rational numbers. 
For example, formula_2 is an algebraic equation with integer coefficients and
:formula_3
is a multivariate polynomial equation over the rationals.
For many authors, the term &quot;algebraic equation&quot; refers only to the univariate case, that is polynomial equations that involve only one variable. On the other hand, a polynomial equation may involve several variables (the &quot;multivariate&quot; case), in which case the term &quot;polynomial equation&quot; is usually preferred.

Some but not all polynomial equations with rational coefficients have a solution that is an algebraic expression that can be found using a finite number of operations that involve only those same types of coefficients (that is, can be solved algebraically). This can be done for all such equations of degree one, two, three, or four; but for degree five or more it can only be done for some equations, not all. A large amount of research has been devoted to compute efficiently accurate approximations of the real or complex solutions of a univariate algebraic equation (see Root-finding algorithm) and of the common solutions of several multivariate polynomial equations (see System of polynomial equations).

==Terminology==
The term &quot;algebraic equation&quot; dates from the time when the main problem of algebra was to solve univariate polynomial equations. This problem was completely solved during the 19th century; see Fundamental theorem of algebra, Abel–Ruffini theorem and Galois theory.

Since then, the scope of algebra has been dramatically enlarged. In particular, it includes the study of equations that involve th roots and, more generally, algebraic expressions. This makes the term &quot;algebraic equation&quot; ambiguous outside the context of the old problem. So the term &quot;polynomial equation&quot; is generally preferred when this ambiguity may occur, specially when considering multivariate equations.

== History ==

The study of algebraic equations is probably as old as mathematics: the Babylonian mathematicians, as early as 2000 BC could solve some kinds of quadratic equations (displayed on Old Babylonian clay tablets).

Univariate algebraic equations over the rationals (i.e., with rational coefficients) have a very long history. Ancient mathematicians wanted the solutions in the form of radical expressions, like formula_4 for the positive solution of formula_5. The ancient Egyptians knew how to solve equations of degree 2 in this manner. The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (597–668 AD) explicitly described the quadratic formula in his treatise Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta published in 628 AD, but written in words instead of symbols. In the 9th century Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi and other Islamic mathematicians derived the quadratic formula, the general solution of equations of degree 2, and recognized the importance of the discriminant. During the Renaissance in 1545, Gerolamo Cardano published the solution of Scipione del Ferro and Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia to equations of degree 3 and that of Lodovico Ferrari for equations of degree 4. Finally Niels Henrik Abel proved, in 1824, that equations of degree 5 and higher do not have general solutions using radicals. Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, showed that some equations of at least degree 5 do not even have an idiosyncratic solution in radicals, and gave criteria for deciding if an equation is in fact solvable using radicals.

== Areas of study ==

The algebraic equations are the basis of a number of areas of modern mathematics: Algebraic number theory is the study of (univariate) algebraic equations over the rationals (that is, with rational coefficients). Galois theory was introduced by Évariste Galois to specify criteria for deciding if an algebraic equation may be solved in terms of radicals. In field theory, an algebraic extension is an extension such that every element is a root of an algebraic equation over the base field. Transcendental number theory is the study of the real numbers which are not solutions to an algebraic equation over the rationals. A Diophantine equation is a (usually multivariate) polynomial equation with integer coefficients for which one is interested in the integer solutions. Algebraic geometry is the study of the solutions in an algebraically closed field of multivariate polynomial equations.

Two equations are equivalent if they have the same set of solutions. In particular the equation formula_6 is equivalent to formula_7. It follows that the study of algebraic equations is equivalent to the study of polynomials.

A polynomial equation over the rationals can always be converted to an equivalent one in which the coefficients are integers. For example, multiplying through by 42 = 2·3·7 and grouping its terms in the first member, the previously mentioned polynomial equation formula_8 becomes
:formula_9

Because sine, exponentiation, and 1/&quot;T&quot; are not polynomial functions,
:formula_10
is &quot;not&quot; a polynomial equation in the four variables &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; over the rational numbers. However, it is a polynomial equation in the three variables &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; over the field of the elementary functions in the variable &quot;T&quot;.

==Theory==
===Polynomials===
Given an equation in unknown 
:formula_11,
with coefficients in a field , one can equivalently say that the solutions of (E) in are the roots in of the polynomial
:formula_12.
It can be shown that a polynomial of degree in a field has at most roots. The equation (E) therefore has at most solutions.

If is a field extension of , one may consider (E) to be an equation with coefficients in and the solutions of (E) in are also solutions in (the converse does not hold in general). It is always possible to find a field extension of known as the rupture field of the polynomial , in which (E) has at least one solution.

=== Existence of solutions to real and complex equations ===

The fundamental theorem of algebra states that the field of the complex numbers is closed algebraically, that is, all polynomial equations with complex coefficients and degree at least one have a solution.

It follows that all polynomial equations of degree 1 or more with real coefficients have a &quot;complex&quot; solution. On the other hand, an equation such as formula_13 does not have a solution in formula_14 (the solutions are the imaginary units and ).

While the real solutions of real equations are intuitive (they are the -coordinates of the points where the curve intersects the -axis), the existence of complex solutions to real equations can be surprising and less easy to visualize.

However, a monic polynomial of odd degree must necessarily have a real root. The associated polynomial function in is continuous, and it approaches formula_15 as approaches formula_15 and formula_17 as approaches formula_17. By the intermediate value theorem, it must therefore assume the value zero at some real , which is then a solution of the polynomial equation.

=== Connection to Galois theory ===

There exist formulas giving the solutions of real or complex polynomials of degree less than or equal to four as a function of their coefficients. Abel showed that it is not possible to find such a formula in general (using only the four arithmetic operations and taking roots) for equations of degree five or higher. Galois theory provides a criterion which allows one to determine whether the solution to a given polynomial equation can be expressed using radicals.

== Explicit solution of numerical equations ==

=== Approach ===

The explicit solution of a real or complex equation of degree 1 is trivial. Solving an equation of higher degree reduces to factoring the associated polynomial, that is, rewriting (E) in the form
:formula_19,
where the solutions are then the formula_20. The problem is then to express the formula_21 in terms of the formula_22.

This approach applies more generally if the coefficients and solutions belong to an integral domain.

===General techniques===
====Factoring====

If an equation of degree has a rational root , the associated polynomial can be factored to give the form (by dividing by or by writing as a linear combination of terms of the form , and factoring out . Solving thus reduces to solving the degree equation . See for example the case.

====Elimination of the sub-dominant term====
To solve an equation of degree ,
:formula_11,
a common preliminary step is to eliminate the degree- term: by setting formula_24, equation (E) becomes
:formula_25.

Leonhard Euler developed this technique for the case but it is also applicable to the case, for example.

=== Quadratic equations ===
To solve a quadratic equation of the form formula_26 one calculates the &quot;discriminant&quot; Δ defined by formula_27.

If the polynomial has real coefficients, it has:
* two distinct real roots if formula_28 ;
* one real double root if formula_29 ;
* no real root if formula_30, but two complex conjugate roots.

=== Cubic equations ===

The best-known method for solving cubic equations, by writing roots in terms of radicals, is Cardano&#x27;s formula.

=== Quartic equations ===

For detailed discussions of some solution methods see:
* Tschirnhaus transformation (general method, not guaranteed to succeed);
* Bezout method (general method, not guaranteed to succeed);
* Ferrari method (solutions for degree 4);
* Euler method (solutions for degree 4);
* Lagrange method (solutions for degree 4);
* Descartes method (solutions for degree 2 or 4);

A quartic equation formula_31 with formula_32 may be reduced to a quadratic equation by a change of variable provided it is either biquadratic () or quasi-palindromic ().

Some cubic and quartic equations can be solved using trigonometry or hyperbolic functions.

=== Higher-degree equations ===
Évariste Galois and Niels Henrik Abel showed independently that in general a polynomial of degree 5 or higher is not solvable using radicals. Some particular equations do have solutions, such as those associated with the cyclotomic polynomials of degrees 5 and 17.

Charles Hermite, on the other hand, showed that polynomials of degree 5 are solvable using elliptical functions.

Otherwise, one may find numerical approximations to the roots using root-finding algorithms, such as Newton&#x27;s method.

<text>The Allen County Courthouse is located at the block surrounded by Clinton/Calhoun/Main/Berry Streets in downtown Fort Wayne, Indiana, the county seat of Allen County. Built between 1897 and 1902, it is a nationally significant example of Beaux-Arts architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 31, 2003.

==History==
Designed by Brentwood S. Tolan, construction began in 1897, the cornerstone was laid November 17, 1897. The building was dedicated September 23, 1902, with a final cost of $817,553.59 ($250 million today). Present at its dedication were Mayor Henry C. Berghoff and Governor Winfield T. Durbin. President Theodore Roosevelt was scheduled to attend, however, he ultimately was not present. On September 23, 2002, the building was re-dedicated on its centennial after a seven-year restoration effort, which cost $8.6 million. 

==Architectural details==
The Beaux-Arts architecture-style structure includes such features as four murals by Charles Holloway, twenty-eight different kinds of scagliola covering , bas-reliefs and art glass. Each of the five court rooms has its own color scheme.

Atop the building is a -high copper-clad domed rotunda, itself topped by a statue wind vane of Lady Liberty. The larger than life statue has feet that would wear a woman&#x27;s shoe size of 28. 

The building materials include Bedford Limestone and Vermont granite with Italian marble details. A tunnel was constructed to connect the Courthouse with the City-County Building located across the street. The Courthouse also houses a fallout shelter underground. The skylights originally built into the building were covered during World War II and replaced with artificial light.

The 2001 National Historic Landmark Nomination says in its opening paragraph: &quot;An elaborate combination of Greek, Roman, and Renaissance influences, the massive courthouse reflects the exuberant ambition of late nineteenth century America.&quot;

<text>A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, district, object, site, or structure that is officially recognized by the United States government for its outstanding historical significance. Only some 2,500, or roughly three percent, of over 90,000 places listed on the country&#x27;s National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are recognized as National Historic Landmarks.

A National Historic Landmark District may include many contributing properties that are buildings, structures, sites or objects, and it may also include non-contributing properties. Contributing properties may or may not also be separately listed as NHLs or on the NRHP.

==History==
Prior to 1935, efforts to preserve cultural heritage of national importance were made by piecemeal efforts of the United States Congress. In 1935, Congress passed the Historic Sites Act, which authorized the interior secretary authority to formally record and organize historic properties, and to designate properties as having &quot;national historical significance&quot;, and gave the National Park Service authority to administer historically significant federally owned properties. Over the following decades, surveys such as the Historic American Buildings Survey amassed information about culturally and architecturally significant properties in a program known as the Historic Sites Survey.

Most of the designations made under this legislation became National Historic Sites, although the first designation, made December 20, 1935, was for a National Memorial, the Gateway Arch National Park (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in St. Louis, Missouri. The first National Historic Site designation was made for the Salem Maritime National Historic Site on March 17, 1938.In 1960, the National Park Service took on the administration of the survey data gathered under this legislation, and the National Historic Landmark program began to take more formal shape. When the National Register of Historic Places was established in 1966, the National Historic Landmark program was encompassed within it, and rules and procedures for inclusion and designation were formalized. Because listings (either on the National Register, or as an NHL) often triggered local preservation laws, legislation in 1980 amended the listing procedures to require owner agreement to the designations.

On October 9, 1960, 92 places, properties, or districts were announced as eligible to be designated NHLs by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton. Agreements of owners or responsible parties were subsequently obtained, but all 92 have since been considered listed on that 1960 date.

The origins of the first National Historic Landmark was a simple cedar post, placed by the Lewis and Clark Expedition on their 1804 outbound trek to the Pacific in commemoration of the death from natural causes of Sergeant Charles Floyd. The cedar plank was later replaced by a marble obelisk. The Sergeant Floyd Monument in Sioux City, Iowa, was officially designated on June 30, 1960.

==Criteria==

NHLs are designated by the United States secretary of the interior because they are:
* Sites where events of national historical significance occurred;
* Places where prominent persons lived or worked;
* Icons of ideals that shaped the nation;
* Outstanding examples of design or construction;
* Places characterizing a way of life; or
* Archeological sites able to yield information.

==Current National Historic Landmarks==

More than 2,500 NHLs have been designated. Most, but not all, are in the United States. There are NHLs in all 50 states and the national capital of Washington, D.C. Three states (Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York) account for nearly 25 percent of the nation&#x27;s NHLs. Three cities within these states, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York City, respectively, all separately have more NHLs than 40 of the 50 states. New York City alone has more NHLs than all but five states: Virginia, California, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York, the latter of which has the most NHLs of all 50 states. There are 74 NHLs in the District of Columbia.

Some NHLs are in U.S. commonwealths and territories, associated states, and foreign states. There are 15 in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other U.S. commonwealths and territories; five in U.S.-associated states such as Micronesia; and one in Morocco.

Over 100 ships or shipwrecks have been designated as NHLs.

Approximately half of the National Historic Landmarks are privately owned. The National Historic Landmarks Program relies on suggestions for new designations from the National Park Service, which also assists in maintaining the landmarks. A friends&#x27; group of owners and managers, the National Historic Landmark Stewards Association, works to preserve, protect and promote National Historic Landmarks.

If not already listed on the National Register of Historic Places, an NHL is automatically added to the Register upon designation; about three percent of Register listings are NHLs. Washington, D.C. is home to three specifically legislated exceptions to this rule: the White House, the United States Capitol, and the United States Supreme Court Building. All are designated as NHLs, but are not on the National Register.

<doc id="404015" wikidata="Q833640" url="?curid=404015" title="Boids">
<text>Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds, and related group motion. His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. The name &quot;boid&quot; corresponds to a shortened version of &quot;bird-oid object&quot;, which refers to a bird-like object.
Reynolds&#x27; boid model is one example of a larger general concept, for which many other variations have been developed since. The closely related work of Ichiro Aoki is noteworthy because it was published in 1982 — five years &quot;before&quot; Reynolds&#x27; boids paper.

==Model details==
As with most artificial life simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules. The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows:
* separation: to avoid crowding local flockmates
* alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
* cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

More complex rules can be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking.

The basic model has been extended in several different ways since Reynolds proposed it. For instance, Delgado-Mata et al. extended the basic model to incorporate the effects of fear. Olfaction was used to transmit emotion between animals, through pheromones modelled as particles in a free expansion gas. Hartman and Benes introduced a complementary force to the alignment that they call the change of leadership. This steer defines the chance of the boid to become a leader and try to escape.

The movement of Boids can be characterized as either chaotic (splitting groups and wild behaviour) or orderly. Unexpected behaviours, such as splitting flocks and reuniting after avoiding obstacles, can be considered emergent.

The boids framework is often used in computer graphics, providing realistic-looking representations of flocks of birds and other creatures, such as schools of fish or herds of animals. It was for instance used in the 1998 video game &quot;Half-Life&quot; for the flying bird-like creatures seen at the end of the game on Xen, named &quot;boid&quot; in the game files.

The Boids model can be used for direct control and stabilization of teams of simple unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) or micro aerial vehicles (MAV) in swarm robotics. For stabilization of heterogeneous UAV-UGV teams, the model was adapted for using onboard relative localization by Saska et al.

At the time of proposal, Reynolds&#x27; approach represented a giant step forward compared to the traditional techniques used in computer animation for motion pictures. The first animation created with the model was &quot;Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice&quot; (1987), followed by a feature film debut in Tim Burton&#x27;s film &quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992) with computer generated bat swarms and armies of penguins marching through the streets of Gotham City.

The boids model has been used for other interesting applications. It has been applied to automatically program Internet multi-channel radio stations. It has also been used for visualizing information and for optimization tasks.

Biologist Richard Dawkins references the Boids model in his 2009 book &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution&quot;.

<text>NBA ShootOut (Total NBA in Europe) is a series of basketball video games based on the NBA and released for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2. It was one of Sony&#x27;s first-party sports franchises for the PlayStation, along with &quot;NHL FaceOff&quot;, &quot;NFL GameDay&quot;, &quot;NCAA GameBreaker&quot; and &quot;ESPN Extreme Games&quot;. The first two entries, released in 1996 and 1997, were developed by Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s British in-house development team. Later entries were developed by 989 Sports, including &quot;NBA ShootOut 2000&quot;, the only game in the series to be released for Microsoft Windows. 

In the games, players can choose an existing NBA franchise and play exhibition or regular season games, as well as create their own players to include in regular season team rosters. Charles Barkley, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Michael Jordan were represented in the game with other names (Forward, Center and Guard respectively).

NBA ShootOut 99 for the PlayStation was cancelled by 989 Sports due to its level of quality.

==Games==
==Reception==
The first two games were well received, with the &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; awarding 9/10 and a Starplayer award to both. They praised the motion capture and the playability.

<doc id="404021" wikidata="Q311728" url="?curid=404021" title="Chiyonofuji Mitsugu">
<text>, born , was a Japanese professional sumo wrestler and the 58th &quot;yokozuna&quot; of the sport. Following his retirement as a wrestler, he was the stable master of Kokonoe stable until the time of his death.

Chiyonofuji was considered one of the greatest &quot;yokozuna&quot; of recent times, winning 31 &quot;yūshō&quot; or tournament championships, second at the time only to Taihō. He was particularly remarkable for his longevity in sumo&#x27;s top rank, which he held for a period of ten years from 1981 to 1991. Promoted at the age of twenty-six after winning his second championship, his performance improved with age, winning more tournaments in his thirties than any other wrestler and dominating the sport in the second half of the 1980s. He finally retired in May 1991, just short of his thirty-sixth birthday.

During his 21-year professional career, Chiyonofuji set records for most career victories (1045) and most wins in the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division (807), earning an entry in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. Both of these records were later broken by Kaiō.

He won the Kyushu tournament, one of the six annual &quot;honbasho&quot;, a record eight consecutive years from 1981 until 1988, and also set the record for the longest postwar run of consecutive wins (53 bouts in 1988). That record stood for 22 years until Hakuhō broke it with his 54th straight win in September 2010.

In a sport where weight is often regarded as vital, Chiyonofuji was quite light at around . He relied on superior technique and muscle to defeat opponents. He was the lightest &quot;yokozuna&quot; since Tochinoumi in the 1960s. Upon his retirement he became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and became the Kokonoe-oyakata the following year.

==Early life==

He was born in Fukushima, a town in the Matsumae District of Hokkaido, northern Japan. He was a son of a fisherman. At school he excelled in athletics events, particularly running. He was scouted at the age of 15 by Kokonoe stable&#x27;s head Chiyonoyama, who had served as the 41st &quot;yokozuna&quot; and was from the same Fukushima town. Chiyonoyama promised him a trip to Tokyo in an airplane, which excited the young Akimoto as he had never flown before. At the time of his debut he weighed just . Chiyonoyama died in 1977, at which time Kitanofuji, the 52nd &quot;yokozuna&quot; and also a Hokkaido native, took over the stable.

==Ring name==
His &quot;shikona&quot; (ring name) surname of was formed from those of the two previous &quot;yokozuna&quot; from his stable, Chiyonoyama and Kitanofuji. is a word used to mean forever. is the same as that in . He was nicknamed due to his ferocity and masculine facial features.

Chiyonofuji began his career in September 1970. He reached the second highest &quot;jūryō&quot; division in November 1974, and was promoted to the top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division in September 1975. However, he lasted only one tournament before being demoted again, and recurring shoulder dislocation injuries led to him falling back to the unsalaried ranks. He finally won promotion back to the top division in January 1978. After receiving a fighting spirit prize in May, Chiyonofuji reached &quot;komusubi&quot; (the fourth-highest rank) for the first time. During his early top division career he was often compared to another lightweight wrestler popular with sumo fans, Takanohana I. Takanohana had first come across Chiyonofuji whilst on a regional tour and encouraged him to give sumo a try. Later, he also advised Chiyonofuji to give up smoking, which helped him put on some extra weight.

In 1979, due to his shoulder trouble, Chiyonofuji briefly fell to the second division, but he soon came back. Encouraged by his stablemaster, he began to rely not only on throwing techniques, which increased the risk of re-injuring his shoulders, but also on gaining ground quickly and forcing out his opponents. Showing much more consistency, he earned three &quot;kinboshi&quot; by defeating &quot;yokozuna&quot; in the March and July 1980 tournaments, where he also got technique prizes. He fought again as a &quot;komusubi&quot; in the May and September tournaments, in the latter of which he won 10 matches in the top division for the first time. Chiyonofuji reached &quot;sekiwake&quot; (the third-highest rank), and stayed at this rank for only two tournament. As a sekiwake, he scored 11–4 in November, and in January 1981 he scored 14–1, losing only one regular match to dominating &quot;yokozuna&quot; Kitanoumi, and then defeated him in the subsequent playoff to win a top &quot;makuuchi&quot; division title for the first time. This earned him promotion to &quot;ōzeki,&quot; the second-highest rank. While making this speedy rise, he won the technique prize in the three previous tournaments, and won it again in that January 1981 tournament where he also earned the outstanding performance prize. As an &quot;ōzeki&quot; he scored well in the following three tournaments up to July 1981, where he again defeated Kitanoumi and won his second title. After this victory, he was promoted to &quot;yokozuna&quot;, the 58th in sumo history.

==&quot;Yokozuna&quot;==
Chiyonofuji had to pull out of his first tournament as a &quot;yokozuna&quot; with an injury, but he returned to win the championship in November, defeating Asashio in a playoff. He later said that this victory was the foundation upon which he built his subsequent success as a &quot;yokozuna&quot;. He was to win the Kyushu tournament eight consecutive years from 1981 to 1988, a record dominance of any of the six specific &quot;honbasho&quot;.

As his rival Kitanoumi went into a long slump, Chiyonofuji dominated sumo in 1982, winning four of the six tournaments. However, another &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Takanosato, emerged over the next two years to challenge him, and he also suffered a number of injury problems. Chiyonofuji was restricted to just one championship in the nine tournaments held from May 1983 to September 1984. But Kitanoumi retired in January 1985, with the aging Takanosato following a year later, and Chiyonofuji resumed his dominance. In 1986 he won five out of the six tournaments held, the first time this had been done since Kitanoumi in 1978. Despite being older and lighter than nearly all his opponents, he dominated the sport throughout the 1980s.

In 1988, he went on a winning streak of 53 bouts, the third longest in sumo history, second to &quot;yokozuna&quot; Hakuhō&#x27;s 63, and Futabayama&#x27;s all-time record of 69. The sequence began on the 7th day of the May 1988 tournament with victory over Hananoumi and continued through the July and September 1988 tournaments, ending only on the final day of the November 1988 tournament when he was defeated by Ōnokuni. Had he won that bout, he would have been the first wrestler ever to win three consecutive tournaments with 15–0 records. Nonetheless, his winning run was the best ever in the postwar period, surpassing the 45 bouts won by Taihō in 1968 and 1969. In July 1989 he took his 28th championship in a playoff from his stablemate Hokutoumi, marking the first time ever that two &quot;yokozuna&quot; from the same stable had met in competition. In September 1989 Chiyonofuji surpassed Ōshio&#x27;s record of 964 career wins and became the first sumo wrestler to receive the People&#x27;s Honour Award from the Japanese Prime Minister. In March 1990, he secured his 1000th win. A 32nd tournament title would have tied the record set by Taihō in 1971, but his 31st championship in November 1990 proved to be his last.

In the opening tournament of 1991, Chiyonofuji surpassed Kitanoumi&#x27;s record of 804 top division wins but injured himself on the second day and had to withdraw. He returned in May, but he lost on the opening day of the tournament to the 18-year-old rising star and future &quot;yokozuna&quot; Takanohana Kōji (then known as Takahanada). It was estimated that half of the Japanese population watched the match on TV. Coincidentally, Takahanada&#x27;s father, Takanohana Kenshi, had retired in 1981 shortly after losing to Chiyonofuji. Chiyonofuji beat Itai on the next day, but this was to be his final win. After losing another match with Takatōriki on the third day, Chiyonofuji announced his own retirement, a few weeks short of his 36th birthday.

==Retirement from the ring==
In September 1989 while Chiyonofuji was still active, the Japan Sumo Association decided to proffer the special status of &quot;ichidai-toshiyori&quot; (one-generation sumo-elder using his ring name as his elder name) to him, but he declined it because he intended to inherit another elder name. Following his retirement from the ring in May 1991, Chiyonofuji inherited the elder name of Jinmaku; then in 1992 he purchased the Kokonoe stable from Kitanofuji and the two exchanged their elder names (Jinmaku and Kokonoe). The purchase price of the stable was reported as being around 50 million yen, below the market rate for a stable. Under his leadership, the stable produced several top wrestlers including former &quot;ōzeki&quot; Chiyotaikai, former &quot;komusubi&quot; Chiyotenzan and former &quot;maegashira&quot; Chiyohakuhō. At the time of his death in 2016, Kokonoe stable was one of the most successful stables in sumo in terms of quantity of &quot;sekitori&quot;, with four men (Chiyotairyū, Chiyomaru, Chiyonokuni, and Chiyootori) in the top division and two (Chiyoshoma and ) in &quot;jūryō&quot;.
He also served for some years as a ringside judge.

In February 2008, he joined the board of directors of the Japan Sumo Association, where he was responsible for organising the regional tours or &quot;jungyō&quot;, but he had to resign in April 2011 after his wrestler Chiyohakuhō admitted involvement in match-fixing and retired from sumo. He returned in the January 2012 elections as the Operations director (the second most senior position in the Association&#x27;s hierarchy), but was unseated two years later. He chose not to run for a board position in the 2016 elections, citing a lack of support.

On May 31, 2015, he marked his 60th birthday by performing the &quot;kanreki dohyō-iri&quot; at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan, becoming the tenth former &quot;yokozuna&quot; to do so. Two active &quot;yokozuna&quot; were his attendants, with Hakuhō the &quot;tachimochi&quot; and Harumafuji acting as &quot;tsuyuharai.&quot;

==Family==
Chiyonofuji announced his engagement shortly after his fifth tournament championship in May 1982. He had a son and three daughters. His second daughter, Kozue Akimoto, born in 1987, is a fashion model. His youngest daughter Ai died at the age of four months, shortly before the July tournament of 1989.

==Death==
Chiyonofuji had surgery for pancreatic cancer in July 2015, and was noticeably weak when speaking to reporters at the Aki basho in September of that year. Having reportedly told associates that the cancer had spread to his heart and lungs, he had been hospitalized since the fourth day of the Nagoya tournament in 2016. He died in Tokyo on July 31, 2016, at the age of 61. The chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, former &quot;yokozuna&quot; Hokutoumi who was a stablemate and protégé of Chiyonofuji, was too grief-stricken to speak to the press in the immediate aftermath of Chiyonofuji&#x27;s death. His former stablemaster, ex-&quot;yokozuna&quot; Kitanofuji, said that he was &quot;blessed with a wonderful disciple.&quot; Another former &quot;yokozuna&quot;, Takanohana, who hastened Chiyonofuji&#x27;s retirement by defeating him in 1991, recalled his fear of Chiyonofuji&#x27;s &quot;metal body&quot; when training with him. On August 2 the Sumo Association announced that a farewell ceremony for Chiyonofuji would be held at the entrance of the Ryōgoku Kokugikan on October 1.

==Fighting style==
Throughout his career, Chiyonofuji&#x27;s trademark &quot;kimarite&quot; or technique was &quot;uwatenage&quot;, or overarm throw. He preferred a &quot;migi-yotsu&quot;, or left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent&#x27;s &quot;mawashi&quot;. His left hand outer grip was so effective that some commentators referred to it as his &quot;death grip.&quot; &quot;Uwatenage&quot; was his second most common winning technique at &quot;sekitori&quot; level after &quot;yorikiri&quot;, or force out. He was also well known for &quot;tsuridashi&quot;, or lift out. He had knowledge of a wide range of other techniques as well, employing 41 different &quot;kimarite&quot; in his career. In January 1987, he won with the very rare &quot;amiuchi&quot;, or fisherman&#x27;s net casting throw, and joked to the press afterwards that it was appropriate for him as he was the son of a fisherman. Chiyonofuji&#x27;s muscular physique, athleticism and dramatic throws made him the most successful and one of the most popular wrestlers of his day.

<doc id="404024" wikidata="Q363992" url="?curid=404024" title="Louis, Duke of Orléans (1703–1752)">
<text>Louis, Duke of Orléans (4 August 1703 – 4 February 1752) was a member of the House of Bourbon, and as such was a &quot;prince du sang&quot;. At his father&#x27;s death, he became the First Prince of the Blood (&quot;Premier Prince du Sang&quot;) and Duke of Orléans. Known as Louis le Pieux and also as Louis le Génovéfain, Louis was a pious, charitable and cultured prince, who took very little part in the politics of the time.

==Early years==

Louis d&#x27;Orléans was born at the Palace of Versailles in 1703 to Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and his wife, Françoise Marie de Bourbon, the youngest legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and of his mistress Madame de Montespan. He was the only son of eight children, and at his birth, he was given the courtesy title of Duke of Chartres as the heir to the Orléans fortune and titles. His maternal grandfather, King Louis XIV of France, in addition gave him the allowance reserved for the First Prince of the Blood, a rank he was not yet eligible to hold.

He was brought up by his mother and his grandmother, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, and tutored by Nicolas-Hubert Mongault, the illegitimate son of Jean-Baptiste Colbert de Saint-Pouange, a cousin of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV&#x27;s minister. He was very close to his mother, the two remaining close until her death in 1749.

Louis was very close to his younger sister Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, who was to become queen consort of Spain for seven months in 1724. He was not, however, close to his elder sister, Charlotte Aglaé d&#x27;Orléans, the wife of Francesco d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena. They were in frequent conflict during her many return visits to the French court from Modena.

===Regency===
Upon the death of his maternal grandfather Louis XIV in 1715, his father, the former king&#x27;s nephew, was selected to be the regent of the country for the five-year-old new king, Louis XV. The court was moved to Paris so his father could govern the country with the young king close by his side. Louis XV was installed in the Palais des Tuileries, opposite of the Palais-Royal, the Paris home of the Orléans family. During the regency, Orléans was seen as the &quot;third personage of the kingdom&quot; immediately after Louis XV and his own father, the regent. He was formally admitted to the &quot;Conseil de Régence&quot; on 30 January 1718. Despite his father&#x27;s wishes, though, the Orléans household was never to play an overly public or political role in France. The following year, he was made the governor of the Dauphiné. He was not forced to move there in order to fulfill his new duties. Later, he resigned. 

In 1720, he became &quot;Grand Master of the Order of Saint-Lazare and Jerusalem&quot;. In 1721, under his father&#x27;s influence, he was named &quot;Colonel général de l&#x27;Infanterie,&quot; and post he held until 1730.

==Duke of Orléans==
Upon the death of his father on 2 December 1723, the twenty-year-old Louis assumed the hereditary title of Duke of Orléans and became the head of the House of Orléans. He also became heir presumptive to the throne of France until the birth of Louis XV&#x27;s first-born son in 1729. This was because King Philip V of Spain, the second son of the Grand Dauphin and uncle of the young king, had renounced his rights to the French throne for himself and his descendants in the Peace of Utrecht in 1713. Although the regent had hoped that his son would assume a prominent role in the government as he had, the post of prime minister went to Louis&#x27; elder cousin, Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, when the regent died. Constantly trying to consolidate and maintain his power at court, the Duke of Bourbon was always suspicious of Louis&#x27; motivations and was frequently opposed to him.

In 1723, the Orléans household was conspicuous for his hostility to the former prime minister, Cardinal Dubois. The Orléans also worked with Claude le Blanc and Nicolas Prosper Bauyn d&#x27;Angervilliers in the post of Secretary of State for War; Louis himself worked in this position from 1723 to 1730.

==Marriage==
The fifth child and only son out of eight children, he was still not married at the death of his father. In 1721, the ambassador of France to Russia suggested a marriage between him and one of the two unmarried daughters of Peter I of Russia: the Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna (known for her fluency in French) or her younger sister, Grand Duchess Yelizaveta Petrovna. But the idea of a marriage with a Russian Grand Duchess had to be abandoned as there soon arose difficulties relative to religion and order of precedence. Louis was a great-grandson of the king of France and as such was entitled to the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot;. A Russian Grand Duchess, however, as a daughter of the tsar, was entitled to the style of &quot;Imperial Highness&quot;. Anna Petrovna later married the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp.

Another possible bride that was considered for him was his first cousin Élisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon. She was the youngest daughter of his mother&#x27;s elder sister, Louise Françoise de Bourbon. Élisabeth Alexandrine was also the younger sister of his main rival, the Duke of Bourbon.

In 1723, a German princess was suggested. She was Auguste of Baden-Baden, the daughter of Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden and his wife Sibylle Auguste of Saxe-Lauenburg. The marriage was agreed upon by his mother, and the bride&#x27;s small dowry set at 80,000 livres. The marriage by proxy took place on 18 June 1724 at Rastatt, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, then on 13 July in the town of Sarry (Marne), in France. It was at Sarry that the couple first met. They fell in love at first sight. At the French court, the new Duchess of Orléans was known as &quot;Auguste de Bade&quot;.

The ducal couple had two children, but only one survived infancy.

==Later life==
On 5 September 1725, the court celebrated the marriage of Louis XV to the Polish princess Marie Leszczyńska at Fontainebleau. Earlier, the Orléans had represented Louis XV at the proxy marriage ceremony, which had taken place the previous 15 August at Strasbourg. The young queen would later have a lot of sympathy for the quiet and pious Duke.

The following year, on 8 August 1726, the duke&#x27;s young wife died three days after the birth of her second child, Louise Marie, at the Palais-Royal in Paris. After the early death of his wife, and until his own death in 1752, Louis lived by strict rules.

His aunt, Élisabeth Charlotte d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Lorraine, proposed her two daughters Élisabeth Thérèse de Lorraine and Anne Charlotte de Lorraine as possible wives; Louis refused outright.

In 1730, Cardinal Fleury secured the duke&#x27;s dismissal from the position of colonel-general of the infantry, a post he had held for nine years. Afterwards, he became increasingly religious. Around 1740, he ordered the employment of a priest at the Palais Royal to stay with him during ill health. He later decided to retire at the Abbaye Sainte-Geneviève de Paris. From then on, he became known as &quot;Louis le Génovéfain&quot;. As he retired into private life, Louis spent his time translating the Psalms and the Pauline epistles, protecting men of science and managing his wealth. Like his cousin, the Duke of Penthièvre, he was praised for his charitable works. After the birth of his son, Orléans was often preoccupied with the education of his son.

His son, Louis Philippe, would have liked to have married Madame Henriette, the second daughter of Louis XV, but Louis XV refused. The king did not want the House of Orléans to be as powerful as it had been during the regency of his Orléans&#x27; father. In 1737 he, along with his aunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bourbon, were asked to be godparents of the king&#x27;s son, Louis de France, Dauphin of France.

On 17 December 1743, his son married Louise Henriette de Bourbon, the daughter of Louis Armand, Prince of Conti and his wife, Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon. The Condé and Orléans families had been at odds since the Orléans had assumed the rank of First Prince of the Blood in 1709, and it was hoped that the marriage would settle their &quot;mésentente&quot;. Although passionate at first, the marriage soon proved unhappy because of the young bride&#x27;s débaucherie.

Louis d&#x27;Orléans would see the birth of his grandchildren Louis Philippe and Bathilde, who, during the French Revolution of 1789, would be known respectively as &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot; and &quot;Citoyenne Vérité&quot;. Because of the scandalous behaviour of their mother, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of his grandchildren.

In 1749, his mother died; he soon died in 1752, at the age of forty-eight, at the Abbaye de Sainte Geneviève, having lost most of his sanity. On his deathbed, on suspicion of Jansenist views, he was refused communion by the Abbé Bouettin of the Saint-Étienne-du-Mont church, but was given the last rites by his own chaplain. He reluctantly received his grandchildren before his death at the behest of his confessor. In his will, he instructed that his body be given to anatomists for dissection. 

Louis d&#x27;Orléans had outlived all his siblings apart from Charlotte Aglaé, the Duchess of Modena and Reggio. He was buried at the Val-de-Grâce in Paris. His funeral was widely attended by the common people of Paris due to his charitable reputation.

==Legacy==

Louis was praised as a very charitable man; in Versailles, the now destroyed &quot;College d&#x27;Orléans&quot;, was named after him due to his generous patronage of the college&#x27;s construction. He also remodelled the gardens at the Palais-Royal as well as the Orléans country residence, the Château de Saint-Cloud (c. 1735). Louis was also praised for giving generous financial aid to victims of floods in the Loire in 1731, and again in 1740.

<doc id="404025" wikidata="Q647033" url="?curid=404025" title="Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force">
<text>Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF; ) was the headquarters of the Commander of Allied forces in northwest Europe, from late 1943 until the end of World War II. US General Dwight D. Eisenhower was the commander in SHAEF throughout its existence. The position itself shares a common lineage with Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Atlantic, but they are different titles.

==History==
Eisenhower transferred from command of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations to command SHAEF, which was formed in Camp Griffiss, Bushy Park, Teddington, London, from December 1943; an adjacent street named Shaef Way, and a gate into the park called Shaef Gate, remain to this day. Southwick House was used as an alternative headquarters near Portsmouth. Its staff took the outline plan for Operation Overlord created by Lieutenant General Sir Frederick E. Morgan, Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate) (COSSAC), and Major General Ray Barker. Morgan, who had been appointed chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (designate) in mid-March 1943 began planning for the invasion of Europe before Eisenhower&#x27;s appointment and moulded the plan into the final version, which was executed on 6 June 1944. That process was shaped by Eisenhower and the land forces commander, General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, for the initial part of the invasion.

SHAEF remained in the United Kingdom until sufficient forces were ashore to justify its transfer to France. At that point, Montgomery ceased to command all land forces but continued as Commander in Chief of the British 21st Army Group (21 AG) on the eastern wing of the Normandy bridgehead. The US 12th Army Group (12 AG) commanded by Lieutenant General Omar Bradley was created as the western wing of the bridgehead. As the breakout from Normandy took place, the Allies launched the invasion of southern France on 15 August 1944 with the US 6th Army Group (6 AG) under the command of Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers. During the invasion of southern France, the 6 AG was under the command of the Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) of the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations, but after one month command passed to SHAEF. By this time, the three Army Groups had taken up the positions on the Western Front in which they would remain until the end of the war—the British 21 AG to the North, the American 12 AG in the middle and the 6 AG to the South. By December 1944, SHAEF had established itself in the Trianon Palace Hotel in Versailles, France. In February 1945, it moved to Reims and on 26 May 1945, to Frankfurt.

==Order of battle==
SHAEF commanded the largest number of formations ever committed to one operation on the Western Front, with American, Free French, British and Canadian forces. It commanded all Allied airborne forces as an airborne army, as well as three army groups that controlled a total of eight field armies;

* First Allied Airborne Army
** all Allied airborne divisions, brigades and paratrooper transport wings
* British 21st Army Group
** First Canadian Army 
** Second British Army
* US 12th Army Group
** First United States Army
** Third United States Army
** Ninth United States Army
** Fifteenth United States Army
* US 6th Army Group
** French First Army
** Seventh United States Army

SHAEF also controlled substantial naval forces during Operation Neptune, the assault phase of Overlord, and two tactical air forces: the US Ninth Air Force and the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Allied strategic bomber forces in the UK also came under its command during Operation Neptune.

==Commanders and senior staff==
Additionally 
*Secretary, General Staff: Colonel Ford Trimble 
*G-1 (Personnel): Major General Ray Barker
*G-2 (Intelligence): Major General John Whiteley, then Major General Kenneth Strong
*G-3 (Operations) : Major General Harold Bull
*G-4 (Logistics): Major General Robert Crawford
*G-5: (Civil/Military Operations) Major General Sir Roger Lumley then Lieutenant General Arthur Edward Grasett
*Services of Supply/Communications Zone: Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee

;Political officers
*Ambassador William Phillips (US)
*Mr. Charles Peake (UK)
*Mr. Christopher Steel (UK)
*Mr. Samuel Reber (US)
*Ambassador Robert Daniel Murphy (US)

==Missions==
==Post-World War II successors==
After the surrender of Germany, SHAEF was dissolved on 14 July 1945.

===American===
With respect to the U.S. forces, it was replaced by U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET). USFET was reorganized as EUCOM (European Command, not to be confused with the present-day United States European Command) on 15 March 1947.

===1948–1951: Western Union===
The 1948–1951 Western Union Defence Organization&#x27;s (WUDO) command structure was largely patterned on SHAEF&#x27;s structure.

===1951–present: Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe/Allied Command Operations===
Starting in April 1951 when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cannibalised WUDO, it was put under the command of Supreme Allied Commander Europe Dwight D. Eisenhower in Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE; Allied Command Europe [ACE]), comprising many of the same allies that were part of SHAEF. WUDO, followed by SHAPE, were in many respects the successors to SHAEF.

SHAPE is currently the headquarters of NATO&#x27;s Allied Command Operations (ACO). Since 1967 it has been located at Casteau, north of the Belgian city of Mons, but it had previously been located, from 1953, at Rocquencourt, next to Versailles, France.

From 1951 to 2003, SHAPE was the headquarters of Allied Command Europe (ACE). Since 2003 it has been the headquarters of ACO, controlling all NATO operations worldwide.

===2017–present: Military Planning and Conduct Capability===
The European Union has established a Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC), which is due to gain more tasks and may rival SHAPE&#x27;s dominance as the primary forum for multinational European missions.

<doc id="404029" wikidata="Q1583962" url="?curid=404029" title="Hansom cab">
<text>The hansom cab is a kind of horse-drawn carriage designed and patented in 1834 by Joseph Hansom, an architect from York. The vehicle was developed and tested by Hansom in Hinckley, Leicestershire, England. Originally called the Hansom safety cab, it was designed to combine speed with safety, with a low centre of gravity for safe cornering. Hansom&#x27;s original design was modified by John Chapman and several others to improve its practicability, but retained Hansom&#x27;s name.

&quot;Cab&quot; is a shortening of &quot;cabriolet&quot;, reflecting the design of the carriage. It replaced the hackney carriage as a vehicle for hire; with the introduction of clockwork mechanical taximeters to measure fares, the name became &quot;taxicab&quot;.

Hansom cabs enjoyed immense popularity as they were fast, light enough to be pulled by a single horse (making the journey cheaper than travelling in a larger four-wheel coach) and were agile enough to steer around horse-drawn vehicles in the notorious traffic jams of nineteenth-century London. There were up to 7500 hansom cabs in use at the height of their popularity and they quickly spread to other cities in the United Kingdom (including Ireland), as well as continental European cities, particularly Paris, Berlin, and St Petersburg. The cab was introduced to other British Empire cities and to the United States during the late 19th century, being most commonly used in New York City.

== Design ==

The cab, a type of &quot;fly&quot;, sat two passengers (three if they squeezed in) and a driver who sat on a sprung seat behind the vehicle. The passengers could give their instructions to the driver through a trap door near the rear of the roof. They could pay the driver through the hatch, and he would then operate a lever to release the doors so that they could alight. In some cabs, the driver could operate a device that balanced the cab and reduced strain on the horse. The passengers were protected from the elements by the cab and by folding wooden doors that enclosed their feet and legs and thus protected their clothes from splashing mud. Later versions also had an up-and-over glass window above the doors to complete the enclosure of the passengers. Additionally, a curved fender mounted forward of the doors protected passengers from the stones thrown up by the hooves of the horse.

Other vehicles similar to the Hansom cab include the American light trade cart for deliveries such as bread, the bow-fronted hansom which was fully enclosed and entered through a side door, and the Brougham Hansom which was entered from the rear and driven from a seat on the fore-part of the roof.

== Hansom Cab Company ==
The Hansom Cab Company was established in May 1869 to provide transportation in New York City and Brooklyn. The business was located at 133 Water Street, Brooklyn; Duncan, Sherman &amp; Company handled the books of subscription (initial offers of stock to capitalize a new company). The enterprise was organized by Ed W. Brandon who became its president. Two orders for a fleet of cabs were sent to carriage makers in New York City. Fares were to be charged either by distance or time: $0.30 for a single person per mile, or portion thereof, and $0.40 for two people. By time, $0.75 for one person for an hour or portion thereof, $1.00 for two persons.

== United Kingdom ==

Two English peers who owned cab companies, Lord Shrewsbury and Lord Lonsdale, raised the standards of all Hansom cabs in London when they purchased upgraded cabs made by Forder, complete with brass fittings, quiet-running rubber tires, and luxuriously fitted interiors. Their horses were thoroughbreds in polished harnesses. These flashier Hansoms were sometimes referred to as &quot;Gondolas of London&quot; or &quot;gondolas of the streets&quot;.

The cabs were widely used in the United Kingdom until 1908 when Taximeter Cars (petrol cabs) started to be introduced and were rapidly accepted; by the early 1920s horse-drawn cabs had largely been superseded by motor vehicles. The last licence for a horse-drawn cab in London was relinquished in 1947.

== Museums ==

A restored hansom cab once owned by Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt is on display at the Remington Carriage Museum in Cardston, Alberta, Canada. There is another surviving example, owned and operated by the Sherlock Holmes Museum in London; in common with other horse-drawn vehicles it is not permitted to enter any of the Royal Parks. Hinckley and Bosworth Borough Council, Leicestershire also have a restored Hansom cab.

== In popular culture ==
* In &quot;Black Beauty&quot; by Anna Sewell, the central section has an evocative account of life as a Hansom cab driver in Victorian London, even though it is written from the point of view of the horse.
* &quot;The Adventure of the Hansom Cab&quot; is the third and final story in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;The Suicide Club&quot; cycle (1878). Retired British soldier Lieutenant Brackenbury Rich is beckoned into the back of an elegantly appointed hansom by a mysterious cabman who whisks him off to a party. 
* In 1886, Fergus Hume published his novel &quot;The Mystery of a Hansom Cab&quot;, set in post-Gold Rush era Melbourne, Australia. The story was filmed in Australia in 1911, under the same title. A movie was made for TV in 2012.
* The 1889 film &quot;Leisurely Pedestrians, Open Topped Buses and Hansom Cabs with Trotting Horses&quot;, photographed by William Friese-Greene, shows Londoners walking along Apsley Gate, Hyde Park, with horse-drawn conveyances passing by.
* The book &quot;Farewell Victoria&quot; (1933) by T. H. White has the protagonist ending his days as a hansom cab operator in its fading years, which is part of the sustained metaphor brought out in the title.

<doc id="404033" wikidata="Q919431" url="?curid=404033" title="Home Guard (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Home Guard (initially Local Defence Volunteers or LDV) was an unpaid armed citizen militia supporting the &#x27;Home Forces&#x27; of the British Army during the Second World War. Operational from 1940 to 1944, the Home Guard comprised more than 1.5 million local volunteers otherwise ineligible for military service, such as those who were too young or too old to join the regular armed services (regular military service was restricted to those aged 18 to 41) and those in reserved occupations. Excluding those already in the armed services, the civilian police or other civil defence volunteer organisations, approximately one in five men were Home Guard volunteers. Their primary role was to act as a secondary defence force in their home locality in case of invasion by the forces of Nazi Germany.

The Home Guard were initially ordered to observe, and report back to General Headquarters Home Forces, any airborne or seaborne invading forces in their local area; an order extended subsequently to harassing and obstructing the advance of the enemy even by a few hours to give the regular troops time to regroup. They were also tasked with guarding and defending key transport intersections and factories in rear areas against possible capture by paratroops or fifth columnists. An additional prime purpose was to maintain control of the civilian population in the event of an invasion, to forestall panic and to prevent communication routes from being blocked by refugees; so as to free the regular forces to fight the Germans. During the German bombing campaign of &#x27;The Blitz&#x27; they were given the duty of seeking out and guarding unexploded bombs, in the course of which over 1,000 were killed. From 1942, the Home Guard manned coastal artillery and anti-aircraft gun and rocket batteries, releasing regular soldiers for the invasion of Europe. The Home Guard continued to man observation points and roadblocks, and to guard coastal areas of the United Kingdom and other strategically important sites such as airfields, factories and explosives stores, until late 1944, when they were stood down. They were formally disbanded on 31 December 1945, eight months after Germany&#x27;s surrender.

Men aged 17 to 65 years could join, although the age limits were not strictly enforced. One platoon had a fourteen year old and three men in their eighties enrolled in it. Service was unpaid (although out-of-pocket expenses could be claimed) but gave a chance for older or inexperienced soldiers to support the war effort.

== Background ==

=== Early ideas for a home defence force prior to the Second World War ===
The origins of the Second World War Home Guard can be traced to Captain Tom Wintringham, who returned from the Spanish Civil War and wrote a book entitled &quot;How to Reform the Army&quot;. In the book, as well as many regular army reforms, Wintringham called for the creation of 12 divisions similar in composition to that of the International Brigades, which had been formed in Spain during the conflict. The divisions would be raised by voluntary enlistment targeting ex-servicemen and youths. Despite great interest by the War Office in the book&#x27;s assertion that &#x27;security is possible&#x27;, Wintringham&#x27;s call to train 100,000 men immediately was not implemented.

== Establishing a home defence force ==
When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, debates began in official circles about the possible ways in which the German military might invade Britain. In the first week of the conflict, numerous diplomatic and intelligence reports seemed to indicate that there was the possibility of an imminent German amphibious assault. Many government ministers and senior army officials, including the Commander in Chief Home Forces, General Walter Kirke, believed that the threat of invasion was greatly exaggerated and were sceptical, but others were not, including Winston Churchill, the new First Lord of the Admiralty.

Churchill argued that some form of home defence force should be raised from people who were ineligible to serve in the regular forces but wished to serve their country. In a letter to Samuel Hoare, the Lord Privy Seal, on 8 October 1939, Churchill called for a Home Guard force of 500,000 men over the age of 40 to be formed.

=== Early local grassroots formation of home defence forces ===
While government officials were debating the need for a home defence force, such forces were actually forming themselves without any official encouragement. In Essex, men not eligible for call-up into the armed forces were coming forward to join the self-styled &quot;Legion of Frontiersmen&quot;. Officials were soon informed of the development of the legion, with the Adjutant-General, Sir Robert Gordon-Finlayson, arguing that the government should encourage the development of more unofficial organisations. The fear of invasion in 1939 quickly dissipated as it became evident that the German military was not in a position to launch an invasion of Britain; official enthusiasm for home defence forces waned and the legion appears to have dissolved itself at the same time.

The Battle of France began on 10 May 1940, with the Wehrmacht invading Belgium, the Netherlands and France. By 20 May, German forces had reached the English Channel, and on 28 May, the Belgian Army surrendered. The combination of the large-scale combined operations mounted by the Wehrmacht during the invasion of Norway in April and the prospect that much of the English Channel coast would soon be occupied made the prospect of a German invasion of the British Isles alarmingly real. Fears of an invasion grew rapidly, spurred on by reports both in the press and from official government bodies, of a fifth column operating in Britain that would aid an invasion by German airborne forces.

=== Increasing pressure on Government to form a home defence force ===
The government soon found itself under increasing pressure to extend the internment of suspect aliens to prevent the formation of a fifth column and to allow the population to take up arms to defend themselves against an invasion. Calls for some form of home defence force soon began to be heard from the press and from private individuals. The press baron Lord Kemsley privately proposed to the War Office that rifle clubs form the nucleus of a home defence force, and Josiah Wedgwood, a Labour MP, wrote to the prime minister asking that the entire adult population be trained in the use of arms and given weapons to defend themselves. Similar calls appeared in newspaper columns: in the 12 May issue of the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, a brigadier called on the government to issue free arms licences and permits to buy ammunition to men possessing small arms, and the same day, the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; asked if the government had considered training golfers in rifle shooting to eliminate stray parachutists.
The calls alarmed government and senior military officials, who worried about the prospect of the population forming private defence forces that the army would not be able to control, and in mid-May, the Home Office issued a press release on the matter. It was the task of the army to deal with enemy parachutists, as any civilians who carried weapons and fired on German troops were likely to be executed if captured. Moreover, any lone parachutist descending from the skies in the summer of 1940 was far more likely to be a downed RAF airman than a German &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot;.

Nevertheless, private defence forces soon began to be formed throughout the country, often sponsored by employers seeking to bolster defence of their factories. This placed the government in an awkward position. The private forces, which the army might not be able to control, could well inhibit the army&#x27;s efforts during an invasion, but to ignore the calls for a home defence force to be set up would be politically problematic. An officially-sponsored home defence force would allow the government greater control and also allow for greater security around vulnerable areas such as munitions factories and airfields; but there was some confusion over who would form and control the force, with separate plans being drawn up by the War Office for a small units of volunteer defenders attached to the existing regular searchlight companies; and by General Headquarters Home Forces under General Kirke for more loosely-organised local bands to be raised under the authority of the Lords Lieutenant of each county.

Over Sunday 12 May 1940,the War Office and senior military officials rapidly compared plans, concluding in favour of the proposals from GHQ Home Forces; and then on 13 May 1940 worked out an improvised scheme for a home defence force, to be called the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV). There had been no consulation with other government departments that would be affected, no consultation with the Treasury over spending approval, and no consultation with the legal officers of the Crown over how volunteers might be claimed to have the legal status of members of the Armed Forces. In the rush to complete a plan and announce it to the public many administrative and logistical problems had been left unresolved, such as how the volunteers in the new force would be armed, which caused problems as the force evolved. On the evening of 14 May 1940, Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden gave a radio broadcast announcing the formation of the LDV and calling for volunteers to join the force: &quot;You will not be paid, but you will receive a uniform and will be armed.&quot;

===Official recognition and enlistment===

In the official radio announcement, Eden called on men between the ages of 17 and 65 years in Britain who were not in military service but wished to defend their country against paratroops in the event of an invasion to enroll in the LDV at their local police station. It was anticipated that up to 500,000 men might volunteer, a number that conformed generally with the Army&#x27;s expectation of the total numbers required to fulfill the LDV&#x27;s expected functions. However, the announcement was met with much enthusiasm: 250,000 volunteers tried to sign up in the first seven days, and by July this had increased to 1.5 million. Social groups such as cricket clubs began forming their own units, but the bulk were workplace-based, especially as co-operation from employers was necessary to ensure that volunteers would be available for training and operational patrols. Indeed, many employers envisaged their LDV units primarily as protecting industrial plants from fifth column and paratroop attack.

==== Women and the Home Guard ====
The Home Guard did not initially admit women as volunteers. Some women formed their own groups like the Amazon Defence Corps. In December 1941, a more organised but still unofficial Women&#x27;s Home Defence (WHD) was formed under the direction of Dr Edith Summerskill, Labour MP for Fulham West. WHD members were given weapons training and basic military training. Limited female involvement in official Home Guard units was to be permitted later &#x27;auxiliaries&#x27;, on the understanding that these would be in traditional female support roles (e.g., clerical, driving) and not in any way seen as combatants.

=== Logistics and practical support issues ===

The War Office continued to lay down the administrative and logistical foundations for the LDV organisation. Eden&#x27;s public words were generally interpreted as an explicit promise to provide everyone who volunteered with a personal firearm. In retrospect, it was recognised that recruitment would have been better limited to the numbers required (and capable of being armed), with later volunteers given places on a waiting list. However, once volunteers had been enlisted, it was considered impossible from a public relations perspective to then dismiss them. Nevertheless, the regular forces saw no priority in providing more arms and equipment to the new force than would have been needed had numbers been properly constrained in the first place.

In telegrams to the lord lieutenants of each county it was explained that LDV units would operate in predefined military areas already used by the regular army, with a General Staff Officer coordinating with civilian regional commissioners to divide these areas into defined zones with an appointed, volunteer, leader. In London, zones were organised on the basis of police districts. On 17 May, the LDV achieved official legal status when the Privy Council issued the &quot;Defence (Local Defence Volunteers) Order in Council&quot;, and orders were issued from the War Office to regular army headquarters throughout Britain explaining the status of LDV units: volunteers would be divided into sections, platoons, companies and groups - each with an appointed volunteer leader; but none would be paid, and leaders of units would not hold commissions or have the power to command regular forces. Finance and logistics for units would be administered (within Great Britain) by County Territorial Army Associations

Implementation of the regulations proved to be extremely difficult, particularly as the primary focus of the War Office and General Headquarters Home Forces was on Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk between 27 May and 4 June 1940. The apparent lack of focus led to many LDV members becoming impatient, particularly when it was announced that volunteers would receive only armbands printed with &quot;L.D.V.&quot; on them until proper uniforms could be manufactured, and there was no assurance as to when weapons would be issued to units. The impatience led to many units conducting their own patrols without official permission, often led by men who had previously served in the armed forces.

The presence of many veterans and the appointment of ex-officers to command LDV units, only worsened the situation, with many believing that they did not require training before being issued weapons. That led to numerous complaints being received by the War Office and the press and to many ex-senior officers attempting to use their influence to obtain weapons or permission to begin patrolling. The issue of weapons to LDV units was particularly problematic for the War Office, as it was recognised that the rearming and re-equipping of the regular forces would have to take precedence over the LDV. Following a radio appeal on 23 May by Richard Law, Financial Secretary to the War Office, public-spirited citizens had handed over registered firearms and shotguns, the police issuing certificates allowing these to be used for LDV duties. By July 1940, over 50,000 civilian shotguns were being used by the LDV and specialised solid-ball 12-bore shot-gun ammunition was developed for units.

For public (and enemy) consumption, the government maintained that large stocks of Lee–Enfield rifles remained from the First World War, but the actual total reserve stockpile amounted to 300,000, and they had already been earmarked for the expansion of the army by 122 infantry battalions. Instead, the War Office issued instructions on how to make Molotov cocktails and emergency orders were placed for Ross rifles from Canada. In the absence of proper weapons, local units improvised weapons, especially grenades, mortars and grenade projectors, from whatever came to hand, and the legacy of self-reliant improvisation in the face of what was interpreted as official disregard and obstruction was to remain as a characteristic of the Home Guard throughout its existence.

=== Unclear role, low morale and disciplinary problems ===
Another problem that was encountered as the LDV was organised was the definition of the role the organisation was to play. Initially, in the eyes of the War Office and the army, the LDV was to act as &#x27;an armed police constabulary&#x27;, which, in the event of an invasion, was to man roadblocks, observe German troop movements, convey information to the regular forces and guard places of strategic or tactical importance. The War Office believed that the LDV would act best in such a passive role because of its lack of training, weapons and proper equipment. Such a role clashed with the expectations of LDV commanders and members who believed that the organisation would be best suited to an active role of hunting down and killing parachutists, and fifth columnists, as well as attacking and harassing German forces. &quot;In the popular mind it was the twin terrors of Nazi paratrooper and Fifth Columnist traitor which were the Home Guard’s nemesis, its natural enemy. Notwithstanding that the Home Guard actually spent most of its time preparing to defend &#x27;nodal points&#x27; against tank attack, operating anti-aircraft artillery or locating unexploded bombs.&quot;The clash led to morale problems and even more complaints to the press and the War Office from LDV members who were opposed, as they saw it, the government&#x27;s leaving them defenceless and placing them in a noncombatant role. Complaints about the role of the LDV and continuing problems encountered by the War Office in its attempts to clothe and arm the LDV, led the government to respond to public pressure in August, redefining the role of the LDV to include delaying and obstructing German forces through any means possible. Also in August, the Home Office and MI5 instituted the &#x27;Invasion List&#x27;, a list of around 1,000 persons whose &#x27;recent conduct or words indicated that they were likely to assist the enemy&#x27; and who would be apprehended by the police in the event of an invasion, hoping thereby to forestall the expectations of many LDV volunteers that they would then be empowered to act as &#x27;Judge, Jury and Executioner&#x27; of potential collaborators and fifth columnists.

At the same time, Churchill, who had assumed the position of Prime Minister in May 1940, became involved in the matter after being alerted to the problems, obtaining a summary of the current LDV position from the War Office on 22 June 1940. After reviewing the summary, Churchill wrote to Eden stating that in his opinion, one of the main causes of disciplinary and morale problems stemmed from the uninspiring title of the LDV and suggesting that it be renamed as the &#x27;Home Guard&#x27;. Despite resistance from Eden and other government officials, who noted that one million &quot;LDV&quot; armbands had already been printed and the cost of printing another million &#x27;Home Guard&#x27; armbands would be excessive, Churchill would not be dissuaded. On 22 July, the LDV was officially renamed the Home Guard. Churchill ruled decisively on the issue of whether civilian volunteers should actively resist German forces, even at the expense of setting themselves outside the protection of the Geneva Conventions. The &#x27;Rules of War&#x27;, he pointed out, had been drawn up with the express intention of avoiding defeated combatants fighting on to the last. However, in the fight against Nazism, any outcome, including the complete destruction of a town and the massacre of its population, would be preferable to its acquiescing to Nazi rule.

=== Formal combatant status ===
The Home Guard in 1940 were an armed uniformed civilian militia, entirely distinct from the regular armed forces. Volunteers originally had no recognised military rank, were not subject to military discipline and could withdraw (or be withdrawn by their employers) at any time. In 1941, nominal ranks were introduced for Home Guard &#x27;officers&#x27;, and in 1942, limited conscription was implemented intended for circumstances where Home Guard forces were taking over functions from regular forces (chiefly coastal artillery and anti-aircraft batteries), and non-officer volunteers became &#x27;privates&#x27;. Volunteers remained legally civilians and failure to attend when ordered to do so was punishable by civilian authorities. Nevertheless, the British Government consistently maintained that as Home Guard service was strictly to be undertaken only in approved uniform. Uniformed volunteers would be lawful combatants within the Geneva Conventions and so would be &quot;prisoners of war&quot; if captured. That was an argument with a long history since armed civilian irregulars (uniformed and non-uniformed) had been widely employed by smaller combatant nations in the First World War, but former British governments had consistently refused to recognise captured irregular combatants in uniform as prisoners of war. Indeed, most of the Irish Republican volunteers executed by the British administration following the 1916 Easter Rising had been fighting or at least surrendered in full Irish Volunteer or Irish Citizen Army uniforms. However, that was an uprising or rebellion of subjects of the Crown and was not entirely comparable to combatants in a war between sovereign states.

German and Austrian military traditions were, if anything, more absolute in rejecting any recognition of civilian militia combatants as prisoners of war since the German response to the nonuniformed &quot;francs-tireurs&quot; who had attacked German forces during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. It had long been standard German military practice that civilians who attacked German troops in areas that opposing regular forces had surrendered, withdrawn or chosen not to defend should be considered properly liable to be shot out of hand. Indeed, German military doctrine had always maintained that their military forces were further entitled in such circumstances to take reprisals against unarmed local civilians - taking and executing hostages, and leveling villages: &quot;fight chivalrously against an honest foe; armed irregulars deserve no quarter&quot;. The actions of regular German forces during the Second World War consistently conformed to those principles: captured partisans in the Soviet Union and the Balkans, whether they were fighting in uniform or not, were killed on the spot. German radio broadcasts described the British Home Guard as &#x27;gangs of murderers&#x27; and left no doubt that they would not be regarded as lawful combatants.

== Organisation, deployment and tactics ==

By the end of 1940, the Home Guard was established into 1,200 battalions, 5,000 companies and 25,000 platoons. For its primary defensive role, each section was trained and equipped to operate as a single, largely independent &#x27;battle platoon&#x27;, with an operational establishment of between 25 and 30 men at any one time although, as volunteers would also have full-time jobs, the numbers of volunteers in each section would be around twice that establishment. In the event of an invasion, the Home Guard battle platoons in a town would be under the overall control of an Army military commander and maintain contact with that commander with a designated &#x27;runner&#x27; (no Home Guard units were issued with wireless sets until 1942), who would usually be a motorbike owner. Otherwise, the battle platoon was static and would defend a defined local area and report on enemy activity in that area, but it was neither equipped nor expected to join up with the mobile forces of the regular army. Each Home Guard unit would establish and prepare a local strongpoint, from which &#x27;civilians&#x27; (non-Home Guard) would be cleared if possible, and aim to defend that strongpoint for as long as possible. It might be forced to retreat towards a neighbouring strongpoint but would not surrender so long as ammunition held out. Most towns of any size would have a number of such Home Guard units, each defending its own strongpoint and providing &#x27;defence in depth&#x27;, which should ideally be sited to offer supporting fire to cover one another and to control road access through the town from all directions.

Each battle platoon had a headquarters section; commander, second in command, runner, and at least one marksman &#x27;sniper&#x27; with an M1917 Enfield rifle. The fighting force of the platoon consisted of three squads of around 8 men, each squad having a three-man automatic weapons group (usually with one either of a BAR or Lewis gun) and a rifle/bomb group armed with M1917 rifles, grenades and sticky-bombs, and a Thompson or Sten sub-machine gun if possible. Men without rifles should all have shotguns, if available. The basic tactical principle was &#x27;aggressive defence&#x27;; fire would be held until the enemy were within the defensive perimeter of the town in force and they would then be attacked with concentrated firepower of bombs, grenades, shotguns and automatic weapons (as much as possible from above and from the rear), with the object of forcing them into cover close by. Retreating enemy forces would be counterattacked (again preferably from the rear), the automatic weapons group of each squad providing covering fire while the bombing group attacked with grenades, submachine guns and shotguns. As many Germans as possible should be killed, and no prisoners would be taken.

Battle tactics were derived substantially from the experience of Spanish Republican forces although they also drew on the experience of the British Army (and the IRA) in Ireland. The emphasis was on drawing the Germans into fighting in central urban areas at short ranges, where stone buildings would provide cover; lines of communication between units would be short; the Home Guard&#x27;s powerful arsenal of shotguns, bombs and grenades would be most effective; and German tanks and vehicles would be constrained by narrow, winding streets.

=== Secret roles of the Home Guard ===
The Home Guard had a number of secret roles. That included sabotage units who would disable factories and petrol installations following the invasion. Members with outdoor survival skills and experience (especially as gamekeepers or poachers) could be recruited into the Auxiliary Units, an extremely secretive force of more highly trained guerrilla units with the task of hiding behind enemy lines after an invasion, emerging to attack and destroy supply dumps, disabling tanks and trucks, assassinating collaborators, and killing sentries and senior German officers with sniper rifles. They would operate from pre-prepared secret underground bases, excavated at night with no official records, in woods, in caves, or otherwise concealed.

These concealed bases, upwards of 600 in number, were able to support units ranging in size from squads to companies. In the event of an invasion, all Auxiliary Units would disappear into their operational bases and would not maintain contact with local Home Guard commanders, who should indeed be wholly unaware of their existence. Hence, although the Auxiliaries were Home Guard volunteers and wore Home Guard uniforms, they would not participate in the conventional phase of their town&#x27;s defence but would be activated once the local Home Guard defence had ended to inflict maximum mayhem and disruption over a further necessarily brief but violent period.

=== Active military combat ===
It is a common fallacy that the Home Guard never fired a shot in anger during the whole of the Second World War. In fact, individual Home Guardsmen helped man anti-aircraft guns as early as the Battle of Britain during the summer of 1940. By 1943, the Home Guard operated its own dedicated batteries of anti-aircraft guns, rockets, coastal defence artillery and engaging German planes with their machine guns. They are credited with shooting down numerous Luftwaffe aircraft and the V-1 flying bombs that followed them in the summer of 1944. The Home Guard&#x27;s first official kill was shot down on Tyneside in 1943. The Home Guard in Northern Ireland also took part in gun battles with the IRA.

A major new function emerged for the Home Guard after the German bombing campaign, the Blitz, in 1940 and 1941; resulting in large numbers of unexploded bombs in urban areas. Home Guard units took on the task of locating unexploded bombs after raids and, if such bombs were found (often after several months or years), would commonly assist in sealing off the danger area and evacuating civilians. Most Home Guard wartime fatalities occurred in the course of that task. Aside from deaths in accidents, the Home Guard lost a total of 1,206 members on duty to unexploded bombs, air and rocket attacks during the war.

==Equipment and training==


For the first few weeks the LDV were poorly armed since the regular forces had priority for weapons and equipment. Since the government could not admit the severe shortage of basic armaments for the regular troops in 1940, the public remained deeply frustrated at the failure to issue rifles to the LDV. Rifles were a particular problem, as domestic production of new Lee-Enfield rifles had ceased after the First World War; and in the summer of 1940 there were no more than 1.5 million serviceable frontline military rifles available in total. Contracts had been placed in the UK, Canada and the United States to build new factories for an updated Lee-Enfield model (designated Rifle No. 4), but in 1940 they were still a long way from volume production. The LDV&#x27;s original role had been envisaged by the army as largely observing and reporting enemy movements, but it swiftly changed to a more aggressive role. Nevertheless, it would have been expected to fight well-trained and equipped troops despite having only negligible training and only weapons such as home-made bombs and shotguns (a solid ammunition for shotguns was developed for that purpose), personal sidearms and firearms that belonged in museums. Patrols were carried out on foot, by bicycle, even on horseback and often without uniforms, although all volunteers wore an armband printed with the letters &quot;LDV&quot;. There were also river patrols using the private craft of members.

Many officers from the First World War armed themselves with Webley Mk VI .455 revolvers (officers had been expected to purchase their sidearms privately and retained them in civilian life). There were also numerous private attempts to produce armoured vehicles by adding steel plates to cars or lorries, often armed with machine guns. These improvised vehicles included the Armadillo armoured truck, the Bison mobile pillbox and the Bedford OXA armoured car (some of these makeshift vehicles were also operated by Royal Air Force units for aerodrome defense).

Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production, had sponsored the emergency creation of the &quot;Car Armoured Light Standard&quot; (a commercial car body with a simple armoured hull and light machine gun), known as the &quot;Beaverette&quot;, for the British armed forces but, to the intense annoyance of the British Army command, he insisted on reserving considerable numbers for Home Guard units guarding key air components factories. LDV units broke into museums, appropriated whatever weapons could be found and equipped themselves with private weapons such as shotguns. Many veterans who had served in the First World War had retained German sidearms as trophies, but ammunition was scarce. Members of the public deposited their sporting rifles at their local police stations, to be used (on loan) by the LDV, and local police forces themselves donated their stocks of military rifles, again on loan, but those expedients provided only around 8,000 rifles (although that number did not include volunteers&#x27; use of their own firearms).

Ex-communist and Spanish Civil War veteran Tom Wintringham, a journalist and key advocate of the LDV and later the Home Guard, opened a private training camp for the LDV at Osterley Park, outside London, in early July 1940. Wintringham&#x27;s training methods were mainly based on his experience in the International Brigades in Spain. Those who had fought alongside him in Spain trained volunteers in anti-tank warfare and demolitions. Bert &quot;Yank&quot; Levy was one of the chief trainers, and his lectures became the source for a book on guerrilla warfare.

Supplies of small arms to the Home Guard improved radically after July 1940, when the active support of US President Franklin Roosevelt allowed the British government to purchase 500,000 M1917 Enfield Rifles and 25,000 M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles from the reserve stock of the US armed forces, but the very limited initial issue of standard Lee-Enfield rifles was withdrawn as the American arms became available, as were some 25,000 Pattern 14 .303 rifles (the British calibre version of the M1917 Enfield) and 60,000 Canadian Ross rifles. The M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles lacked the bipod stand and carrying handle that the US army had applied in an attempt to convert the weapon into a light machine gun but, when used primarily as a semiautomatic rifle fired from the shoulder (as was advised in Home Guard training manuals), one or two such weapons in a battle platoon could provide formidable additional firepower. In the hands of a trained soldier, each BAR could maintain a firing rate of up to 40 single shots per minute. Furthermore, the British government had placed large commercial orders for Thompson submachine guns, which were issued first to the Home Guard from 1941 onwards (especially to the secret Auxiliary Units). The British Expeditionary Force had lost almost its entire stock of Bren light machine guns in the Dunkirk evacuation and the regular army initially fell back on prewar and American Lewis guns as a stopgap; but by the end of 1940, around 14,000 of these American Lewis guns (together with some 4,000 American M1917 Browning machine guns) had been released to the Home Guard. From the perspective of the War Office, this removed weapons using US ammunition from regular army use, and had the further advantage that the three volunteers in the machine gun team would not expect rifles. This model of Lewis gun had been designed to be swivel-mounted in aircraft; before issuing to the Home Guard the fitted spade-handle stock was extended into a crude shoulder stock, and a wooden fore-grip and rigid triangular bipod added.

Within a few months, the Home Guard had acquired proper uniforms and equipment as the immediate needs of the regular forces were satisfied. Special trains were laid on to rush the M1917 rifles and Browning Automatic Rifles to Home Guard units, and by the end of July, all had been distributed. Priority in mid-1940 was given to Home Guard units on the South Coast and Home Counties and those defending key air industry suppliers from air and paratroop attack, and had an invasion happened in September or October, those Home Guard units would have largely been well equipped and armed for a static defence role, the key remaining lack being an effective anti-tank grenade capable of being launched a reasonable distance. After September 1940, the army began to take charge of the Home Guard training in Osterley, and Wintringham and his associates were gradually sidelined. Wintringham resigned in April 1941. Ironically, despite his support of the Home Guard, Wintringham was never allowed to join the organisation himself because of a policy barring membership by communists and fascists.
Nevertheless, Home Guard members continued to express dissatisfaction with their armaments until 1943 since not all of the 1.5 million members could be provided with their own rifle or pistol. Although large numbers of M1917 Enfield rifles and Browning Automatic Rifles had been purchased for the use of the Home Guard, they had had to be laboriously cleaned of their heavy cosmoline packing grease by the Home Guard units themselves. All the American guns (M1917 Enfield Rifles, BAR, Lewis light machine guns and Browing M1917 machine guns) used the .30-06 Springfield cartridge, an 0.30 inch round, a type of ammunition totally different from and more powerful than the 0.303 round used by the service issue British Lee–Enfield rifle. A red band was painted around the fore end of the stock of the Enfield and BAR weapons as a warning since a 0.303 round would not load, but jam the rifle.

The Thompson guns used .45 ACP pistol ammunition, again not British Army standard, which was one major reason that the weapons had been turned down for use by the regular army in the first place. Indeed, it rapidly became accepted that any weapons firing US calibre .30 ammunition would go to the Home Guard. Each gun came with an adequate supply of ammunition: 50 rounds for each Enfield, 750 for each BAR and up to 1,000 rounds for the &#x27;Tommy Guns&#x27;. However, Home Guard units were commonly not allowed to fire them in practice shooting as, until America entered the war, there were no reserve ammunition stocks, which reinforced the impression that they were not frontline weapons.

For regular shooting practice, the Home Guard mainly borrowed Territorial Army shooting ranges and guns, with limited issue of live .22 and .303 ammunition. From 1942, the Thompson guns (and their ammunition) were increasingly withdrawn to be issued to Commando forces but were replaced by large numbers of Sten submachine guns. For the first time, all Home Guard members could have their own issue firearm.

Home Guard training at Osterley Park had disseminated experience from Spanish Republican forces, in using improvised grenades and bombs in urban warfare against tanks. Two particular weapons were recommended for that purpose: the satchel bomb, a fused explosive charge in a canvas bag, and the Molotov cocktail, a glass bottle containing a mixture of petrol and a gelling agent.

The Home Guard inherited weapons that the regular army no longer required, such as the Blacker Bombard antitank weapon, and weapons they no longer desired, such as the Sticky bomb. The arsenal also included weapons that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials needed to produce armaments for the regular units such as the Northover Projector, a blackpowder-powered mortar; the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade, a glass bottle filled with highly-flammable material; and the Smith gun, a small artillery gun that could be towed by a car.

===&quot;Croft&#x27;s Pikes&quot;===
By late 1940, the Home Guard had amassed 847,000 rifles, 47,000 shotguns and 49,000 machine guns of various kinds. With more than 1,682,000 volunteers, 739,000 men were thus unarmed. There was little improvement in June 1941, when Churchill wrote to the War Office saying that &quot;every man must have a weapon of some sort, be it only a mace or a pike&quot;. The civil servants took Churchill at his word and ordered 250,000 pikes from the Ministry of Aircraft Production, each consisting of a long steel tube with an obsolete bayonet welded to the end. When the first reached the Home Guard, there was uproar, and it is thought that none was actually issued.

Captain Godfrey Nicholson, MP, spoke for the Home Guard when he said in the House of Commons that the provision of pikes, &quot;if not meant as a joke, was an insult&quot;. Lord Croft, the Under-Secretary of State for War, could have blamed the fiasco on Churchill but defended the decision by saying that the pike was &quot;a most effective and silent weapon&quot;. His name was attached to the affair thereafter. The armaments shortage was solved when the first mass-produced Sten submachine guns entered service early in 1942.

== Fifth Column ==
The German invasion of Poland in September 1939 had been supported by prepared irregular units raised from ethnic German populations in western Poland. Linking with the Brandenburg Regiment, troops equipped to fight in the uniforms of their opponents or disguised as civilians. As the German armed services refused to countenance regular troops engaging in such clearly irregular tactics, the Brandenburgers in Poland served under the command of the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, German military intelligence. Counterpart tactics were employed in the spring of 1940 in support of the German invasions of Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands, but German success in those invasions was more substantially because of the use of paratroopers to seize and hold key defence points behind the front line and to prevent the defending forces from concentrating against the main German ground forces. British public opinion conflated the two tactics and concluded that the rapidity of the German victories in Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands had to be caused by German paratroops linking with a prepared &#x27;fifth column&#x27; in each country of Nazi sympathisers and ethnic Germans.

Now that Britain might potentially face invasion, the British press speculated that the German Gestapo had already prepared two lists of British civilians: &quot;The Black Book&quot; of known anti-fascists and prominent Jews who would be rounded up following an invasion and &#x27;The Red Book&#x27; of &#x27;Nazi sympathisers&#x27; who would support the German invaders as a fifth column. The police and security services found themselves deluged with a mass of denunciations and accusations against suspected fifth columnists. General Ironside, Commander in Chief, Home Forces, was convinced that substantial landowners in the British fifth column had already prepared secret landing strips in South East England for the use of German airborne forces. The Imperial General Staff, spurred on by Churchill, pressed for widespread internment of Nazi- sympathisers.

The government&#x27;s worst fears were briefly thought to have been confirmed on 20 May 1940. Tyler Kent, a cipher clerk in the US embassy spying for the Germans, was apprehended by MI5. Kent had in his possession a locked ledger of 235 names, which was the prewar membership records of the &quot;Right Club&quot;, an anti-war and anti-Semitic association run by the Conservative MP Archibald Maule Ramsay. None of that was made public at the time, but there was widespread public demand that if the names in the &#x27;Red Book&#x27; could be obtained by the Security Services, they should be supplied to local Home Guard units in the event of an invasion. Lord Swinton was ordered by Churchill to determine the true extent of the threat and to propose measures to deal with it. Swinton&#x27;s immediate response was that internment of British nationals with pro-German sympathies should be greatly extended, and Oswald Mosley and other leaders of the British Union of Fascists were interned on 21 May 1940, with some 700 other suspects.

However, following the loss at sea on 2 July 1940 of the , carrying German and Italian internees to Canada, the impracticalities and potential injustices of internment became more apparent, and the public understanding of the fifth column threat changed from being directed towards enemy nationals towards upper and upper-middle class Englishmen. Within a few weeks, the Security Services admitted that it had been unable to confirm any actual instance of organised fifth column activity or even any actual confirmed fifth columnist. Churchill, &quot;with an impressive display of amnesia&quot;, asserted in the House of Commons at the end of August 1940 that he had always considered the fifth column threat to be exaggerated, and many of those detained were silently released. From that time on, the primary official response to fears of fifth column activity was that the names of those for whom there was substantial grounds for suspicion would be added to the &#x27;Invasion List&#x27; and that fifth column activity otherwise would be countered by the Home Guard.

There had been no active Fifth Column actually established by the Germans in Britain in 1940 although numbers of fascist sympathisers might have joined one had they been approached. Nevertheless, Home Guard volunteers continued to assume that a major part of their military role would be to apprehend potential fifth columnists and hunt down and kill any that might mobilise in support of an invasion and prevent their linking up with German paratroops.

==Paratrooper defence==
The use of German paratroopers in Rotterdam, where &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; landed in a football stadium and then hijacked private transport to make their way to the city centre, demonstrated that nowhere was safe. It was widely reported that the paratroops in the Netherlands had been assisted and guided by ethnic German servants in reaching their targets and that was reported as fact by the British ambassador. From July 1940, to counter the threat of an airborne assault, the Home Guard manned observation posts, where soldiers spent every night continuously watching the skies and were initially armed with shotguns but rapidly re-equipped with M1917 rifles.

Official British intelligence reports in 1940 gave credence to the belief that German paratroops routinely engaged in &#x27;dirty tricks&#x27; by appearing in the uniforms of opposing forces or masquerading as civilians. Stray parachutists separated from their units were claimed to have feigned surrender to overpower and kill their captors with concealed weapons. In the first (unofficial) published Home Guard training manuals such warnings were re-enforced, with the advice that &quot;the pretenders should be promptly and suitably dealt with&quot; although otherwise official Home Guard guidance would avoid putting &#x27;shoot to kill&#x27; orders in writing.

Following the German airborne capture of Crete in May 1941, further advice was rapidly disseminated throughout the Home Guard on defence against paratroops in the light of what was now learned about &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; tactics. In particular, it was noted that in German parachute drops, the paratroops themselves were armed only with a pistol and knife and for a period would be highly vulnerable until they had located and unpacked their separate dropped equipment containers. To disperse British regular forces around the country to provide rapid response cover for potential drop areas would severely deplete the main Home Defence order of battle, but that role appeared tailor-made for local Home Guard units and so throughout 1940 and 1941, defence against paratroops dominated much Home Guard thinking and training. Even after the immediate threat of an invasion had passed, Home Guard units associated with key industrial plants were provided with extra equipment, and Beaverette armoured cars, specifically to defend against possible paratroop raids.

To spread word in the event of an invasion, the Home Guard set up a relatively simple code to warn their compatriots. For instance, the word &quot;Cromwell&quot; indicated that a paratrooper invasion was imminent, and &quot;Oliver&quot; meant that the invasion had commenced. Additionally, the Home Guard arranged to use church bells as a call-to-arms for the rest of the LDV, which led to a series of complex rules governing who had keys to bell towers, and the ringing of church bells was forbidden at all other times.

==Uniform==

On 22 May 1940, eight days after the formation of the LDV, the War Office announced that 250,000 field service caps were to be distributed as the first part of the uniform of the new force and that khaki brassards or &quot;armlets&quot; were being manufactured, each carrying the letters &quot;LDV&quot; in black. In the meantime, LDV units improvised their own brassards with whatever materials were available. Local Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service branches were often asked to produce them, sometimes by using old puttees donated by veterans.

The British Army used loose-fitting work clothes called &quot;Overalls, Denim&quot; which were made of khaki-coloured cotton twill fabric and consisted of a short jacket or &quot;blouse&quot; and trousers. They were cut to the same style as and were designed to be worn over the 1938 pattern Battle Dress. It was announced that 90,000 sets of denim overalls would be released from military stores at once and that more would be issued as soon as they could be manufactured.

On 25 June, Anthony Eden announced in the House of Commons that LDV uniform was intended &quot;to consist of one suit of overalls of design similar to that of battle dress, a field service cap, and an armlet bearing the letters &#x27;L.D.V.&#x27;&quot;. On 30 July 1940, Eden further announced that the Home Guard (as the LDV had been renamed) would be issued with military boots as supplies became available.

The issue of uniforms proceeded slowly because of shortages and the need to re-equip and enlarge the army following the Fall of France. On 14 August, Eden announced that the supply of material to make the denim overalls was insufficient and that regular battle dress would be released to the Home Guard as an interim measure. By the end of 1940, the Cabinet had approved the expenditure of £1 million for the supply of battle dress to the whole force. On 20 August 1940, it was further announced that blankets were being issued and that the intention was to provide the Home Guard with greatcoats.

As winter approached, there were many complaints from Home Guardsmen who had to patrol or stand sentry without the benefit of a uniform overcoat. Therefore, a large cape made of heavy serge fabric was hastily designed and issued in the interim. There was no prospect of being able to provide sufficient sets of the 1937 pattern web equipment (including belt, ammunition pouches and a haversack) to the Home Guard and so a simplified equipment set made from leather and canvas was produced. Particularly unpopular were the awkward leather &quot;anklets&quot; which were issued in place of the webbing gaiters worn by the army. The lack of provision of steel helmets was keenly felt, especially by those Home Guardsmen required to be on guard duty during the Blitz when the risk of being hit by a shell splinter was high. That situation was only gradually rectified.

===Northern Ireland===
In Northern Ireland, the provincial government had placed the LDV under the control of the Royal Ulster Constabulary; they were known as the Ulster Defence Volunteers, and then the Ulster Home Guard. The police held large stocks of black cloth in reserve, for use by the Ulster Special Constabulary in the event of large-scale civil insurgency. The black cloth was quickly made up into uniforms in the style of the denim overalls by the many clothing factories in the province. The Ulster Home Guard kept their black uniforms until Battle Dress began to be issued in April 1941.

==Ranks==
When the Home Guard was first formed, it had its own rank structure. As a unit of volunteers, it was thought that there should be a system of appointed ranks, with officers who did not hold a King&#x27;s Commission.

It was not until November 1940 that it was decided to bring the Home Guard structure into line with the regular army. From February 1941, officers and men were known by regular army ranks except that &quot;Private&quot; was not used until the spring of 1942, when the rank of &quot;Volunteer&quot; was dropped in favour of &quot;Private&quot;.

After November 1940, officers were granted a King&#x27;s Commission but were regarded as junior in rank to a regular army officer of the equivalent rank and senior to army officers of a junior rank.

== American participation ==
Churchill had recognised that the Home Guard offered a powerful opportunity to promote pro-British sentiments in the United States and hoped that by encouraging US interest and participation in the Home Guard, it might be possible to advance his aspirations to bring the United States into the war against Germany. Although there were also strong practical advantages in directing weapons sourced in the United States towards the Home Guard, rather than the regular army, the prompt issuing of very large numbers of modern American rifles and machine guns to the Home Guard still offered a golden opportunity for British propaganda, which was widely exploited.

The messages sought to be disseminated in the propaganda was that &#x27;Britain can take it&#x27; and would never concede to Nazi domination and would be a steadfast ally and also that the Britain being defended was a repository of traditional civility and humanitarian values. One consequence was to establish a representation of the Home Guard through popular films, such as &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; and &quot;Went the Day Well&quot;, as defending idealised rural English villages, but most Home Guard units were in fact in towns and cities, and most volunteers were industrial workers.

=== Committee for American Aid for the Defense of British Homes ===
In November 1940, a committee was formed to collect donations of pistols, rifles, revolvers, shotguns and binoculars from American civilians; to be provided to Home Guard units. Most useful were pistols, especially police issue revolvers, provided from the reserve stocks of US city police departments, many of which went to support Home Guard Auxiliary units.

===1st American Squadron of the Home Guard===

On 17 May 1940, the United States Embassy advised the 4000 Americans living in Britain to return home &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; A sterner message in June warned &quot;that this may be the last opportunity for Americans to get home until after the war.&quot; Many Americans chose to remain, and on 1 June 1940, the 1st American Squadron of the Home Guard was formed in London. They had average strength of 60–70, and were commanded by General Wade H. Hayes.

The US ambassador in London, Joseph Kennedy, opposed the mustering of citizens from a neutral power. He feared that in the event of invasion, a civilian squadron would make all citizens of the then still-neutral America living in London liable to be shot by the invading Germans as &quot;francs-tireurs&quot;.

== Evolution of role and eventual disbandment ==

The German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 clearly indicated that an immediate invasion of Britain was no longer to be expected but initially, the British military command did not expect Soviet resistance to last more than a few months and so the Home Guard needed to be retained in full readiness should the German threat be resumed in greater strength once the Soviets had been defeated. The Home Guard remained in existence manning guard posts and performing other duties to free up regular troops for duties overseas, especially taking over the operation of coastal artillery batteries and anti-aircraft batteries (especially rocket batteries for the protection of key industrial sites). In 1942, the National Service Act allowed for compulsory enrolment in the Home Guard of men aged 42 to 51 years where units were below strength. Meanwhile, the lowest rank within the Home Guard, &#x27;volunteer&#x27;, was renamed to &#x27;private&#x27; to match the regular army usage.

=== Disbandment ===
It was only when the tide on the Eastern Front had definitively turned against Germany in 1943 that the military necessity for the Home Guard began to recede. Even so, both military planners and the public maintained an apprehension that the Germans might launch seaborne or airborne commando raids against targets in Southern England to disrupt the preparations for the Second Front or to assassinate Allied leaders. Following the successful landings in France and the drive towards Germany by the Allies, the Home Guard were formally stood down on 3 December 1944 and finally disbanded on 31 December 1945.

=== Recognition certificates ===
Male members were rewarded with a certificate, bearing the words: &quot;In the years when our Country was in mortal danger, &quot;(name)&quot; who served &quot;(dates)&quot; gave generously of his time and powers to make himself ready for her defence by force of arms and with his life if need be. George R.I.&quot; If he had served more than three years and requested it, a member would be awarded the Defence Medal. It was only in 1945 that women who had helped as auxiliaries were recognised with their own certificate.

== Social impact ==
Anthony Eden summarised the raising and equipping of the British Home Guard during a debate in the House of Commons in November 1940, when he was Secretary of State for War: &quot;No one will claim for the Home Guard that it is a miracle of organisation... but many would claim that it is a miracle of improvisation, and in that way it does express the particular genius of our people. If it has succeeded, as I think it has, it has been due to the spirit of the land and of the men in the Home Guard&quot;.

General Sir John Burnett-Stuart, the commander of the 1st Aberdeen Battalion, commented that the Home Guard &quot;was the outward and visible sign of the spirit of resistance&quot;. The chief constable of Glasgow suggested that criminal elements joined the Home Guard to break, enter and loot during the blackout.

==Representations==
Alison Uttley brought the Home Guard into her &quot;Little Grey Rabbit&quot; series of children&#x27;s stories with &quot;Hare Joins The Home Guard&quot; in 1942.

In the wartime Hollywood blockbuster film &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; starring Greer Garson, Clem Miniver (the father of the family) provides his own motor launch to form a Local Defence Volunteer &#x27;River patrol&#x27;; together with whom he crosses the English Channel in support of the Dunkirk evacuation.

The British wartime propaganda film &quot;Went the Day Well?&quot; starring Thora Hird and made at Ealing Studios in 1942 focuses on how the Home Guard and the population of a village defeat the combined forces of German paratroops and local fifth columnists.

Noël Coward wrote a song in 1943, &quot;Could You Please Oblige Us with a Bren Gun?&quot; that pokes fun at the disorder and shortage of supplies and equipment that were common in the Home Guard, and indeed all of Britain, during the war.

The Home Guard also played a significant part in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&#x27;s 1943 film &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot;. In it, the lead character, a career soldier who had retired from the active list, joins the Home Guard and rises to a leadership position in it. He has planned a Home Guard training exercise for the following day; in which he himself would be the designated &#x27;flag target&#x27; for capture by the opposite side; but they break the rules and seize him in advance in a Turkish bath. The film celebrates and justifies the Home Guard fundamental philosophy, that in the combat against Nazism all the previous &#x27;rules of war&#x27; had been rendered obsolete.

The 1943 British film &quot;Get Cracking&quot; starred George Formby as a Home Guard lance corporal who is constantly losing and winning back his stripe. Formby&#x27;s platoon is involved in rivalry with the Home Guard sections of the local villages Major Wallop and Minor Wallop. At the end of the film Formby is promoted to sergeant after inventing a secret weapon – a home-made tank.

The Home Guard also featured in the 1971 Disney film &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;.

In the last of his &#x27;Old Sam&#x27; series of monologues, Stanley Holloway wrote of the protagonist of the series, Sam, attempting to join the army at the outbreak of war in 1939. In the series, Sam is a serviceman who fought at the Battle of Waterloo and in the First World War as an adult. In the monologue dealing with World War II Sam is sent to the Home Guard instead of the front line, much to his bemusement, and whilst there finds that his stories of glory are debunked by another character who turns out to be the Duke of Wellington with whom he fought at Battle of Waterloo.

The Home Guard appears in a scene in the film &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (1987) when a unit shoots down a wayward barrage balloon and in the 2003 &quot;War Games&quot; episode of the British detective series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;, which is set in Hastings during World War II. In 2010, an episode of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; featured Clyde Langer being transported back to the British coast during World War II, and featured the Home Guard.

=== &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; ===

The Home Guard was immortalised in the British television comedy &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, which followed the formation and running of a platoon in the fictional south coast town of Walmington-on-Sea, and is widely regarded as having kept the efforts of the Home Guard in the public consciousness. It was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft and was loosely based on Perry&#x27;s own experiences in the Home Guard. Broadcast on BBC Television from 31 July 1968 (The Man and the Hour) to 13 November 1977 (Never Too Old), the sitcom ran for 9 series and 80 episodes in total (74 regular episodes, 3 missing episodes and 3 Christmas specials), plus a radio version based on the television scripts, two feature films and a stage show. The series regularly gained audiences of 18 million viewers and is still repeated worldwide.

&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; focuses primarily on a platoon of Home Guard volunteers ineligible for military service on grounds of age, and as such the series mainly featured older British actors, including Arthur Lowe, John Le Mesurier, Arnold Ridley and John Laurie (Ridley and Laurie had served in the Home Guard during the war). Among relative youngsters in the regular cast were Ian Lavender, Clive Dunn (who played the elderly Jones), Frank Williams, James Beck (who died suddenly during production of the programme&#x27;s sixth series in 1973) and Bill Pertwee.

In 2004, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; was voted into fourth place in a BBC poll to find Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom. It had been placed 13th in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 and voted for by industry professionals. The series has influenced popular culture in the United Kingdom, with the series&#x27; catchphrases and characters being well known. It highlighted a forgotten aspect of defence during the Second World War. The &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine listed Captain Mainwaring&#x27;s &quot;You stupid boy!&quot; among the 25 greatest put-downs on TV. A film featuring Bill Nighy, Sir Michael Gambon, Toby Jones and Sir Tom Courtenay was released in 2016.

==Home Guard honours==
== Post-war revivals of the Home Guard ==
=== Home Guard: 1952–1957 ===
Not long after the Home Guard had been disbanded, suggestions began to be made that it be revived in the face of a new threat from the Soviet Union. The first official step was a paper by the Director of Military Operations (DMO) in November 1948, which was later incorporated into an executive committee of the Army Council (ECAC) report. Suggested roles included countering communist inspired insurrection as well as guarding vulnerable points and anti-invasion duties. In May 1949, a parliamentary Home Guard Working Party was established to consider the issues raised, which resulted in a further report being completed in August 1950.

Although preliminary planning started, such as the identification of suitable battalion commanders, nothing concrete was done because of financial constraints. It was not until Winston Churchill again become prime minister and Minister of Defence in the general election of October 1951 that preparations to revive the Home Guard began in earnest. Churchill predicted that there could be an assault on Britain by &quot;twenty thousand or so&quot; Soviet paratroopers (an assessment of the risk was not requested until March 1953, the outcome of which was that &quot;the Chiefs of Staff believe that the Russians would not contemplate such a step – with or without atomic bombardment...&quot;).

The speech from the throne on 6 November 1951 included the intention to &quot;take the necessary measures... to re-establish the Home Guard&quot;. While the required legislation was in passage through parliament, the Chiefs-of-Staff produced yet another report, outlining the final form that the new Home Guard should take. The force would consist of two categories of battalions; 162 would be &quot;Category A&quot; which would recruit 60 per cent of their projected wartime strength, while 397 &quot;Category B&quot; battalions would be established on an &quot;en cadre&quot; basis, a skeleton staff of trained officers and NCOs which could be expanded in a crisis. The majority of the Category A battalions would be in the south and east of England. The Home Guard Act 1951 received Royal Assent on 7 December. Enrolment started on 2 April 1952. The aim was to recruit 170,000 men in the first year, but by November 1952, only 23,288 had been enrolled, with a further 20,623 men who had joined a &quot;Reserve Roll&quot; (initially called the &quot;Supernumerary Register&quot;) for enrolment in an emergency.

Uniform consisted of standard 1949 pattern battledress and midnight blue beret as worn by the rest of the army. Scottish battalions wore a Balmoral bonnet. A helmet and greatcoat were provided, along with 1937 pattern webbing. Small arms issued to the Home Guard were the Lee-Enfield No 4 Mk 1 rifle and the Mk II Sten sub-machine gun; the Bren gun was the section automatic weapon. Support weapons were the obsolescent PIAT antitank projector, the Vickers medium machine gun and the 2-inch mortar. A detachment of the Home Guard led the British Army section of the State Procession at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.

There was much criticism of the cost of the Home Guard, especially the full-time officers, since all battalions had a paid adjutant and quartermaster whose workload was quite limited, especially in Category B units. Accordingly, on 20 December 1955, it was announced that there would be a &quot;reorganisation on a reserve basis&quot;. The essence was all battalions would be reduced to a &quot;cadre&quot; basis, and paid staff would have to effect the change before resigning their commissions or transferring to the Reserve Roll by 1 April 1956. A certificate of thanks was issued to those who had served in an active role. Even those reforms were not enough, and on 26 June 1957, John Hare, the Secretary of State for War, announced in parliament that the Home Guard would be disbanded on 31 July, making a saving of £100,000 in that year.

===Home Service Force: 1982–1993===
At the height of the Cold War, the Home Service Force was established in 1982, starting with four &quot;pilot companies&quot;. Recruitment began in earnest in 1984, but was limited to those who had previously served in the armed forces or reserves. Some 48 HSF units were formed, each hosted by an existing Territorial Army battalion. After the end of the Cold War, disbandment of the force commenced in 1992 as a part of the &quot;peace dividend&quot;.

<doc id="404037" wikidata="Q6984523" url="?curid=404037" title="Neats and scruffies">
<text>In the history of artificial intelligence (AI), neat and scruffy are two contrasting approaches to AI research. The distinction was made in the 1970s, and was a subject of discussion until the mid-1980s.

&quot;Neats&quot; use algorithms based on a single formal paradigm, such as logic, mathematical optimization, or neural networks. Neats verify their programs are correct via rigorous mathematical theory. Neat researchers and analysts tend to express the hope that this single formal paradigm can be extended and improved in order to achieve general intelligence and superintelligence.

&quot;Scruffies&quot; use any number of different algorithms and methods to achieve intelligent behavior, and rely on incremental testing to verify their programs. Scruffy programming requires large amounts of hand coding and knowledge engineering. Scruffy experts have argued that general intelligence can only be implemented by solving a large number of essentially unrelated problems, and that there is no silver bullet that will allow programs to develop general intelligence autonomously. 

John Brockman compares the neat approach to physics, in that it uses simple mathematical models as its foundation. The scruffy approach is more biological, in that much of the work involves studying and categorizing diverse phenomena.

Modern AI has elements of both scruffy and neat approaches. Scruffy AI researchers in the 1990s applied mathematical rigor to their programs, as neat experts did. They also express the hope that there is a single paradigm (a &quot;master algorithm&quot;) that will cause general intelligence and superintelligence to emerge. But modern AI also resembles the scruffies: modern machine learning applications require a great deal of hand-tuning and incremental testing; while the general algorithm is mathematically rigorous, accomplishing the specific goals of a particular application is not. Also, in the early 2000s, the field of software development embraced extreme programming, which is a modern version of the scruffy methodology: try things and test them, without wasting time looking for more elegant or general solutions.

==Origin in the 1970s==
The distinction between neat and scruffy originated in the mid-1970s, by Roger Schank. Schank used the terms to characterize the difference between his work on natural language processing (which represented commonsense knowledge in the form of large amorphous semantic networks) from the work of John McCarthy, Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, Robert Kowalski and others whose work was based on logic and formal extensions of logic. Schank described himself as an AI scruffy. He made this distinction in linguistics, arguing strongly against Chomsky&#x27;s view of language.

The distinction was also partly geographical and cultural: &quot;scruffy&quot; attributes were exemplified by AI research at MIT under Marvin Minsky in the 1970s. The laboratory was famously &quot;freewheeling&quot; and researchers often developed AI programs by spending long hours fine-tuning programs until they showed the required behavior. Important and influential &quot;scruffy&quot; programs developed at MIT included Joseph Weizenbaum&#x27;s ELIZA, which behaved as if it spoke English, without any formal knowledge at all, and Terry Winograd&#x27;s SHRDLU, which could successfully answer queries and carry out actions in a simplified world consisting of blocks and a robot arm. SHRDLU, while successful, could not be scaled up into a useful natural language processing system, because it lacked a structured design. Maintaining a larger version of the program proved to be impossible, i.e. it was too scruffy to be extended.

Other AI laboratories (of which the largest were Stanford, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Edinburgh) focused on logic and formal problem solving as a basis for AI. These institutions supported the work of John McCarthy, Herbert Simon, Allen Newell, Donald Michie, Robert Kowalski, and other &quot;neats&quot;.

The contrast between MIT&#x27;s approach and other laboratories was also described as a &quot;procedural/declarative distinction&quot;. Programs like SHRDLU were designed as agents that carried out actions. They executed &quot;procedures&quot;. Other programs were designed as inference engines that manipulated formal statements (or &quot;declarations&quot;) about the world and translated these manipulations into actions. 

In his 1983 presidential address to Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Nils Nilsson discussed the issue, arguing that &quot;the field needed both&quot;. He wrote &quot;much of the knowledge we want our programs to have can and should be represented declaratively in some kind of declarative, logic-like formalism. Ad hoc structures have their place, but most of these come from the domain itself.&quot; Alex P. Pentland and Martin Fischler of SRI International concurred about the anticipated role of deduction and logic-like formalisms in future AI research, but not to the extent that Nilsson described.

==Scruffy projects in the 1980s==

The scruffy approach was applied to robotics by Rodney Brooks in the mid-1980s. He advocated building robots that were, as he put it, Fast, Cheap and Out of Control, the title of a 1989 paper co-authored with Anita Flynn. Unlike earlier robots such as Shakey or the Stanford cart, they did not build up representations of the world by analyzing visual information with algorithms drawn from mathematical machine learning techniques, and they did not plan their actions using formalizations based on logic, such as the &#x27;Planner&#x27; language. They simply reacted to their sensors in a way that tended to help them survive and move.

Douglas Lenat&#x27;s Cyc project was initiated in 1984 one of earliest and most ambitious projects to capture all of human knowledge in machine readable form, is &quot;a determinedly scruffy enterprise&quot;. The Cyc database contains millions of facts about all the complexities of the world, each of which must be entered one at a time, by knowledge engineers. Each of these entries is an ad hoc addition to the intelligence of the system. While there may be a &quot;neat&quot; solution to the problem of commonsense knowledge (such as machine learning algorithms with natural language processing that could study the text available over the internet), no such project has yet been successful.

== The Society of Mind ==
In 1986 Marvin Minsky published &quot;The Society of Mind&quot; which advocated a view of intelligence and the mind as an interacting community of modules or agents that each handled different aspects of cognition, where some modules were specialized for very specific tasks (e.g. edge detection in the visual cortex) and other modules were specialized to manage communication and prioritization (e.g. planning and attention in the frontal lobes). Minsky presented this paradigm as a model of both biological human intelligence and as a blueprint for future work in AI. 

This paradigm is explicitly &quot;scruffy&quot; in that it does not expect there to be a single algorithm that can be applied to all of the tasks involved in intelligent behavior. Minsky wrote: 

As of 1991, Minsky was still publishing papers evaluating the relative advantages of the neat versus scruffy approaches, e.g. “Logical Versus Analogical or Symbolic Versus Connectionist or Neat Versus
Scruffy”.

== Modern AI as both neat and scruffy ==
New statistical and mathematical approaches to AI were developed in the 1990s, using highly developed formalisms such as mathematical optimization and neural networks. Pamela McCorduck wrote that &quot;As I write, AI enjoys a Neat hegemony, people who believe that machine intelligence, at least, is best expressed in logical, even mathematical terms.&quot; This general trend towards more formal methods in AI was described as &quot;the victory of the neats&quot; by Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell in 2003. 

However, by 2021, Russell and Norvig had changed their minds. Deep learning networks and machine learning in general require extensive fine tuning -- they must be iteratively tested until they begin to show the desired behavior. This is a scruffy methodology.

<doc id="404046" wikidata="Q1370596" url="?curid=404046" title="Suica">
<text>Suica () is a prepaid rechargeable contactless smart card and electronic money system used as a fare card on train lines and other public transport systems in Japan, launched on November 18, 2001, by JR East. The card can be used across the nation as part of Japan&#x27;s Nationwide Mutual Usage Service. The card is also widely used as electronic money for purchases at stores and kiosks, especially at convenience stores and within train stations. In 2018, JR East reported that Suica was used for 6.6 million daily transactions. As of October 2023, 95.64 million Suica (including Mobile Suica) have been issued, and 1.63 million stores accept payment via Suica&#x27;s digital currency.

Since Suica is completely interchangeable with PASMO (see &quot;Interoperation&quot;), it is supported on virtually any train, tramway, or bus system in Tokyo and the Greater Tokyo Area (excluding various limited and &quot;shinkansen&quot; trains, as well as some local buses).

==Etymology==
Suica is an abbreviation of &quot;Super Urban Intelligent Card. In the logo, the letters &quot;ic&quot; are highlighted, which stand for integrated circuit and see use in the term &quot;IC card&quot;, the common Japanese word for smart card. An additional meaning comes from the ideophone &quot;sui sui&quot; which means &quot;to move smoothly and swiftly&quot;, intended to highlight the simplicity of using the card compared with traditional train tickets. Since penguins can also swim smoothly through water, a penguin is used as a motif. The was designed by illustrator Chiharu Sakazaki.

==Uses==
While Suica&#x27;s primary usage is as a fare card for public transportation, it can also be used as electronic money for general purchases. With the exception of archaic, first-generation cards printed before 2004, all Suica have the logo, which indicates that the card can be used for e-money payments.

Other components that may also appear alongside the e-money mark include:

* Two dots (&quot;●●&quot;) below the logo, indicating support for FeliCa Pocket services such as various reward point programs.
** This mark formerly indicated support for , a system that allowed users to charge their Suica via the web, as well as using the card for online shopping via a FeliCa NFC reader/writer peripheral device known as PaSoRi. The service was introduced in July 2009 and retired in February 2021.
* A plus sign (&quot;+&quot;) to the right of the logo, designating the card as an &quot;affiliate card&quot; with other attached services. This includes Suica integrated with credit cards (see &quot;Credit card integrations&quot;), virtual Suica that support recharging via mobile payment (see &quot;Mobile Suica&quot;), and 2-in-1 Multi-function Cards for Regional Transit.

Chain stores such as FamilyMart, 7-Eleven, Lawson, Yodobashi Camera, Bic Camera, Doutor Coffee, CoCo Ichibanya, and MOS Burger support transactions with Suica. Many shops at Narita International Airport, Haneda Airport, and taxis also accept Suica payment. Stores that accept IC card payment are indicated by displaying the Nationwide Mutual Usage Service &quot;IC&quot; logo, typically alongside the various card logos. Most vending machines, kiosks, and coin-operated lockers within JR stations can also be paid with the card; the card may also be used as an electronic key to open the specific locker used. 

As of 2004, JR East employees use the card as an employee ID card.

==Functions and services==
 
Usage of the card involves scanning it at a card reader. The card&#x27;s technology allows for it to be read at a short distance from the reader, so contact is not required, despite instructions which often inform users to cards on readers. Many riders leave IC cards in wallets or pass cases, and pass these objects over reader when entering a ticket gate. The balance on the card is displayed when riders pass through ticket gates. The minimum fare to ride at least one stop is required to enter, but no fare is charged until the user exits the system, upon which cards much be touched on readers again.

A travel record of the past 20 trips is stored on the card, and can be displayed or printed out at ticket machines or some fare adjustment machines.

Along with fare balance, Suica may store commuter passes, pre-purchased fares for one, three, or six month periods along a certain route which make future rides a line between the specified stations free of charge.

When traveling from a JR East station where Suica is supported to a station outside of the JR East area, purchasing a ticket is required. Tickets may be purchased with a Suica&#x27;s balance.

==Points of purchase==
Suica are available at ticket vending machines or customer service windows in the Suica area, namely at all JR East train stations. A new card costs 2,000 yen, which includes a 500 yen deposit that will be refunded if the card is returned. The remaining 1,500 yen is immediately available for rides on transport, and more money can be charged on to the card (in 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, and 10,000 yen increments), up to a card maximum of 20,000 yen. Cards may also be charged at at fare adjustment machines within any station&#x27;s ticket gates, i.e. inside the fare-paid zone.

On June 8, 2023, railway operators including JR East announced a temporary suspension of sales of unregistered cards, which do not display the customer&#x27;s name, due to the 2020–2023 global chip shortage. In August 2023, sales of registered cards displaying the customer&#x27;s name (My Suica) were also suspended, and customers were encouraged to use Mobile Suica instead. As of March 2024, sales of the card remain officially suspended &quot;for the time being&quot;, but since January 2024 have been available in limited quantities to foreign tourists at customer service centers.

==Types of cards==
Suica are sold by JR East and two of its subsidiaries:
*Suica (and My Suica), Welcome Suica, and View Suica are sold directly by JR East
*Rinkai Suica are sold by Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit (Rinkai Line)
*Monorail Suica are sold by Tokyo Monorail

===Credit card integrations===
The pairs the prepaid Suica with a credit card. Various types of these &quot;affiliate cards&quot; exist, including at least one available through JR and View, and others such as the Bic Camera Suica. These function both as a prepaid Suica as well as a regular credit card, and provide an auto-charge feature to prevent exhausting the Suica balance. The automatically recharged amount is added to the user&#x27;s credit card bill. Thus, these cards have two balances: a prepaid Suica balance and a credit balance for which monthly bills are sent. Thus, store-related cards like the Bic Suica can include fully three separate functions: serving as a store point card, a general use Suica, and as a credit card. Any credit purchase (restricted, in the case of Bic, to JCB) adds a small amount to the available points on the store point card. Yet another type of Suica offered by Japan Airlines that is called JALCARD Suica. In addition to having Suica and credit card functionalities, a JALCARD Suica can also function as an electronic boarding pass for a JAL-operated domestic flight in Japan at an airport that offers the JAL IC service.

===My Suica===
&quot;My Suica&quot; is JR East&#x27;s term for a Suica registered in one&#x27;s name. Riders may input their personal information at the time the card is created which allows for a transfer of balance if the card is lost, stolen, or breaks. Child versions (which charge half fares) are also available.

===Welcome Suica===

In August 2019, JR East unveiled Welcome Suica, a Suica variant designed to be used by international tourists visiting Japan. The card&#x27;s design features white cherry blossoms on a red background. Welcome Suica is also reloadable, but unlike regular Suica cards, Welcome Suica does not require the user to make a deposit. However, Welcome Suica can only be used for 28 days from the date of purchase after which it expires permanently. It is also nonrefundable, regardless of the balance or user&#x27;s activity.

JR East request customers always carry with them a reference sheet, or receipt, to accompany the card. Child versions (which charge half fares) are also available.

==Card stacking==
Ticket gates return an error when the scan encounters more than one compatible card. Although it is intended that each person have only one Suica, many people have more than one, or may carry other IC cards as well. Consequently, JR East began an awareness campaign in March 2007 to discourage commuters from storing multiple cards together. Incompatible cards, such as Edy, seem to have an inconsistent effect on a machine&#x27;s ability to read the card which may depend on the reading device. On the other hand, the Express-IC (EX-IC) card for Tokaido Shinkansen reservations is meant to be used in this manner (stacked on top of an IC card to facilitate transfer between Shinkansen and regular lines).

==Technology==
The card incorporates a contactless Near Field Communication (NFC) technology developed by Sony called FeliCa. The same technology is also deployed in the Edy electronic cash cards used in Japan, the Octopus card in Hong Kong, and the EZ-Link Card in Singapore.

==Interoperation==
On 18 March 2007, the Tokyo-area private railways, bus companies, and subways implemented PASMO, a smart card solution to replace the existing Passnet magnetic card system. Through collaboration with JR East, passengers can use Suica wherever PASMO cards are accepted to ride any railway or bus in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Monthly passes for JR East lines can only be on Suica, while monthly passes for Tokyo Metro can only be on PASMO cards; besides this caveat, the cards are functionally identical for commuters.

This agreement has since been implemented with other systems across Japan, known as the Nationwide Mutual Usage Service. As a result, beginning in 2013, Suica has full interoperability with Kitaca, PASMO, TOICA, manaca, ICOCA, PiTaPa, SUGOCA, nimoca, and Hayakaken IC cards.

On 22 July 2014, Nintendo added support for Suica and PASMO cards in the Nintendo eShop through the NFC function of the Wii U GamePad and the New Nintendo 3DS. The service was discontinued on January 18, 2022.

==Mobile devices==
===Mobile Suica===
Since January 2006, a version called was incorporated into mobile FeliCa wallet phones by Japan&#x27;s mobile operators. This system includes Java applications to manage the Suica function in the mobile phone, to recharge the Suica stored in the mobile phone, review the stored value and perform other functions via the mobile phone. An enhancement for 2007 allowed for Suica charges to be added directly to the phone bill, eliminating the requirement to constantly add to and monitor the remaining balance. On May 23, 2011, JR announced debut of Mobile Suica app for Android Smartphones supporting Osaifu-Keitai. It was first launched by the carriers NTT DoCoMo and au, and now also offered by SoftBank Mobile and Willcom.

Like physical cards, Mobile Suica cards can also be charged when the remaining balance gets low. Other features supported by the mobile phone includes the ability to review past Suica transactions via the phone&#x27;s display. Mobile Suica interacts with the FeliCa chip using Java technology.

Since October 2006, it is possible to register for Mobile Suica using any major credit card. A limited e-money-only application called &quot;Easy Mobile Suica&quot; (which does not require a credit card) was also launched in late October 2006.

=== Apple Pay ===
On September 7, 2016, Apple announced that Suica cards could be added to Apple Pay in the Wallet app and used in the same way as a physical card. This functionality was limited to devices purchased in Japan which included FeliCa support: iPhone 7 (model A1779 and A1785) and Apple Watch Series 2. With the release of the iPhone 8, iPhone X and the Apple Watch Series 3, and later, devices purchased anywhere in the world could be used with Apple Pay Suica.

iOS 13 introduced support for creating a virtual Suica card from the Wallet app.

iOS 15 introduced new Wallet app improvements and a dedicated category for adding Suica and other transit cards regardless of the device region setting.

=== Google Pay ===
On May 24, 2018, Google announced that Suica cards could be added to Google Pay. This functionality is limited to Android devices that have their Google Account&#x27;s region set to Japan and which support Osaifu-Keitai, i.e. the phone must have been purchased in Japan, or be rooted (and have a FeliCa chip, as modern Google Pixel phones do) to enable this feature.

<doc id="404048" wikidata="Q772056" url="?curid=404048" title="Computing Machinery and Intelligence">
<text>&quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot; is a seminal paper written by Alan Turing on the topic of artificial intelligence. The paper, published in 1950 in &quot;Mind&quot;, was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the Turing test to the general public.

Turing&#x27;s paper considers the question &quot;Can machines think?&quot; Turing says that since the words &quot;think&quot; and &quot;machine&quot; cannot be clearly defined, we should &quot;replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.&quot; To do this, he must first find a simple and unambiguous idea to replace the word &quot;think&quot;, second he must explain exactly which &quot;machines&quot; he is considering, and finally, armed with these tools, he formulates a new question, related to the first, that he believes he can answer in the affirmative.

==Turing&#x27;s test==

Rather than trying to determine if a machine is thinking, Turing suggests we should ask if the machine can win a game, called the &quot;Imitation Game&quot;. The original Imitation game, that Turing described, is a simple party game involving three players. Player A is a man, player B is a woman and player C (who plays the role of the interrogator) can be of either sex. In the Imitation Game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B (and knows them only as X and Y), and can communicate with them only through written notes or any other form that does not give away any details about their gender. By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A&#x27;s role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one.
Turing proposes a variation of this game that involves the computer:

So the modified game becomes one that involves three participants in isolated rooms: a computer (which is being tested), a human, and a (human) judge. The human judge can converse with both the human and the computer by typing into a terminal. Both the computer and human try to convince the judge that they are the human. If the judge cannot consistently tell which is which, then the computer wins the game.

Researchers in the United Kingdom had been exploring &quot;machine intelligence&quot; for up to ten years prior to the founding of the field of artificial intelligence (AI) research in 1956. It was a common topic among the members of the Ratio Club, an informal group of British cybernetics and electronics researchers that included Alan Turing. Turing, in particular, had been running the notion of machine intelligence since at least 1941 and one of the earliest-known mentions of &quot;computer intelligence&quot; was made by him in 1947.

As Stevan Harnad notes, the question has become &quot;Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?&quot; In other words, Turing is no longer asking whether a machine can &quot;think&quot;; he is asking whether a machine can &quot;act&quot; indistinguishably from the way a thinker acts. This question avoids the difficult philosophical problem of pre-defining the verb &quot;to think&quot; and focuses instead on the performance capacities that being able to think makes possible, and how a causal system can generate them.

Since Turing introduced his test, it has been both highly influential and widely criticised, and has become an important concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Some of its criticisms, such as John Searle&#x27;s Chinese room, are themselves controversial. Some have taken Turing&#x27;s question to have been &quot;Can a computer, communicating over a teleprinter, fool a person into believing it is human?&quot; but it seems clear that Turing was not talking about fooling people but about generating human cognitive capacity.

==Digital machines==
Turing also notes that we need to determine which &quot;machines&quot; we wish to consider. He points out that a human clone, while man-made, would not provide a very interesting example. Turing suggested that we should focus on the capabilities of digital machinery—machines which manipulate the binary digits of 1 and 0, rewriting them into memory using simple rules. He gave two reasons.

First, there is no reason to speculate whether or not they can exist. They already did in 1950.

Second, digital machinery is &quot;universal&quot;. Turing&#x27;s research into the foundations of computation had proved that a digital computer can, in theory, simulate the behaviour of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. (This is the essential insight of the Church–Turing thesis and the universal Turing machine.) Therefore, if &quot;any&quot; digital machine can &quot;act like it is thinking&quot;, then &quot;every&quot; sufficiently powerful digital machine can. Turing writes, &quot;all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.&quot;

This allows the original question to be made even more specific. Turing now restates the original question as &quot;Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?&quot;

Hence, Turing states that the focus is not on &quot;whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers that are presently available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which would do well&quot;. What is more important is to consider the advancements possible in the state of our machines today regardless of whether we have the available resource to create one or not.

==Nine common objections==
Having clarified the question, Turing turned to answering it: he considered the following nine common objections, which include all the major arguments against artificial intelligence raised in the years since his paper was first published.

#&quot;Religious Objection&quot;: This states that thinking is a function of man&#x27;s immortal soul; therefore, a machine cannot think. &quot;In attempting to construct such machines,&quot; wrote Turing, &quot;we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates.&quot;
#&quot; &#x27;Heads in the Sand&#x27; Objection&quot;: &quot;The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful. Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so.&quot; This thinking is popular among intellectual people, as they believe superiority derives from higher intelligence and the possibility of being overtaken is a threat (as machines have efficient memory capacities and processing speed, machines exceeding the learning and knowledge capabilities are highly probable). This objection is a fallacious appeal to consequences, confusing what should not be with what can or cannot be (Wardrip-Fruin, 56).
#&quot;The Mathematical Objection&quot;: This objection uses mathematical theorems, such as Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, to show that there are limits to what questions a computer system based on logic can answer. Turing suggests that humans are too often wrong themselves and pleased at the fallibility of a machine. (This argument would be made again by philosopher John Lucas in 1961 and physicist Roger Penrose in 1989, and later would be called Penrose–Lucas argument.)
#&quot;Argument From Consciousness&quot;: This argument, suggested by Professor Geoffrey Jefferson in his 1949 Lister Oration (acceptance speech for his 1948 award of Lister Medal) states that &quot;not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain.&quot; Turing replies by saying that we have no way of knowing that any individual other than ourselves experiences emotions, and that therefore we should accept the test. He adds, &quot;I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness ... [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think].&quot; (This argument, that a computer can&#x27;t have &quot;conscious experiences&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot;, would be made in 1980 by philosopher John Searle in his Chinese room argument. Turing&#x27;s reply is now known as the &quot;other minds reply&quot;. See also Can a machine have a mind? in the philosophy of AI.)
#&quot;Arguments from various disabilities&quot;. These arguments all have the form &quot;a computer will never do &quot;X&quot;&quot;. Turing offers a selection:Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humour, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.Turing notes that &quot;no support is usually offered for these statements,&quot; and that they depend on naive assumptions about how versatile machines may be in the future, or are &quot;disguised forms of the argument from consciousness.&quot; He chooses to answer a few of them:
##&quot;Machines cannot make mistakes.&quot; He notes it&#x27;s easy to program a machine to appear to make a mistake.
##&quot;A machine cannot be the subject of its own thought&quot; (or can&#x27;t be self-aware). A program which can report on its internal states and processes, in the simple sense of a debugger program, can certainly be written. Turing asserts &quot;a machine can undoubtably be its own subject matter.&quot;
##&quot;A machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour&quot;. He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways.
#&quot;Lady Lovelace&#x27;s Objection&quot;: One of the most famous objections states that computers are incapable of originality. This is largely because, according to Ada Lovelace, machines are incapable of independent learning.The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to &quot;originate&quot; anything. It can do whatever &quot;we know how to order it&quot; to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. Turing suggests that Lovelace&#x27;s objection can be reduced to the assertion that computers &quot;can never take us by surprise&quot; and argues that, to the contrary, computers could still surprise humans, in particular where the consequences of different facts are not immediately recognizable. Turing also argues that Lady Lovelace was hampered by the context from which she wrote, and if exposed to more contemporary scientific knowledge, it would become evident that the brain&#x27;s storage is quite similar to that of a computer.
#&quot;Argument from continuity in the nervous system&quot;: Modern neurological research has shown that the brain is not digital. Even though neurons fire in an all-or-nothing pulse, both the exact timing of the pulse and the probability of the pulse occurring have analog components. Turing acknowledges this, but argues that any analog system can be simulated to a reasonable degree of accuracy given enough computing power. (Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus would make this argument against &quot;the biological assumption&quot; in 1972.)
#&quot;Argument from the informality of behaviour&quot;: This argument states that any system governed by laws will be predictable and therefore not truly intelligent. Turing replies by stating that this is confusing laws of behaviour with general rules of conduct, and that if on a broad enough scale (such as is evident in man) machine behaviour would become increasingly difficult to predict. He argues that, just because we can&#x27;t immediately see what the laws are, does not mean that no such laws exist. He writes &quot;we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, &#x27;we have searched enough. There are no such laws.&#x27;&quot;. (Hubert Dreyfus would argue in 1972 that human reason and problem solving was not based on formal rules, but instead relied on instincts and awareness that would never be captured in rules. More recent AI research in robotics and computational intelligence attempts to find the complex rules that govern our &quot;informal&quot; and unconscious skills of perception, mobility and pattern matching. See Dreyfus&#x27; critique of AI). This rejoinder also includes the Turing&#x27;s Wager argument.
#&quot;Extra-sensory perception&quot;: In 1950, extra-sensory perception was an active area of research and Turing chooses to give ESP the benefit of the doubt, arguing that conditions could be created in which mind-reading would not affect the test. Turing admitted to &quot;overwhelming statistical evidence&quot; for telepathy, likely referring to early 1940s experiments by Samuel Soal, a member of the Society for Psychical Research.

==Learning machines==

In the final section of the paper Turing details his thoughts about the Learning Machine that could play the imitation game successfully.

Here Turing first returns to Lady Lovelace&#x27;s objection that the machine can only do what we tell it to do and he likens it to a situation where a man &quot;injects&quot; an idea into the machine to which the machine responds and then falls off into quiescence. He extends on this thought by an analogy to an atomic pile of less than critical size, which is to be considered the machine, and an injected idea is to correspond to a neutron entering the pile from outside the pile; the neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. Turing then builds on that analogy and mentions that, if the size of the pile were to be sufficiently large, then a neutron entering the pile would cause a disturbance that would continue to increase until the whole pile were destroyed, the pile would be supercritical. Turing then asks the question as to whether this analogy of a super critical pile could be extended to a human mind and then to a machine. He concludes that such an analogy would indeed be suitable for the human mind with &quot;There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to be &quot;subcritical,&quot; i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of sub critical size. An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply. A smallish proportion are supercritical. An idea presented to such a mind that may give rise to a whole &quot;theory&quot; consisting of secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas&quot;. He finally asks if a machine could be made to be supercritical.

Turing then mentions that the task of being able to create a machine that could play the imitation game is one of programming and he postulates that by the end of the century it will indeed be technologically possible to program a machine to play the game. He then mentions that in the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind it becomes important to consider the processes that lead to the adult mind being in its present state; which he summarizes as:
::1. The initial state of the mind, say at birth,
::2. The education to which it has been subjected,
::3. Other experience, not to be described as education, to which it has been subjected.
Given this process he asks whether it would be more appropriate to program a child&#x27;s mind instead of an adult’s mind and then subject the child mind to a period of education. He likens the child to a newly bought notebook and speculates that due to its simplicity it would be more easily programmed. The problem then is broken down into two parts, the programming of a child mind and its education process. He mentions that a child mind would not be expected as desired by the experimenter (programmer) at the first attempt. A learning process that involves a method of reward and punishment must be in place that will select desirable patterns in the mind. This whole process, Turing mentions, to a large extent is similar to that of evolution by natural selection where the similarities are:
::Structure of the child machine = hereditary material
::Changes of the child machine = mutations
::Natural selection = judgment of the experimenter
Following this discussion Turing addresses certain specific aspects of the learning machine: 
:* Nature of inherent complexity: The child machine could either be one that is as simple as possible, merely maintaining consistency with general principles, or the machine could be one with a complete system of logical inference programmed into it. This more complex system is explained by Turing as &quot;..would be such that the machines store would be largely occupied with definitions and propositions. The propositions would have various kinds of status, e.g., well-established facts, conjectures, mathematically proved theorems, statements given by an authority, expressions having the logical form of proposition but not belief-value. Certain propositions may be described as &quot;imperatives.&quot; The machine should be so constructed that as soon as an imperative is classed as &quot;well established&quot; the appropriate action automatically takes place&quot;. Despite this built-in logic system the logical inference programmed in would not be one that is formal, rather it would be one that is more pragmatic. In addition the machine would build on its built-in logic system by a method of &quot;scientific induction&quot;.

:* Ignorance of the experimenter: An important feature of a learning machine that Turing points out is the ignorance of the teacher of the machines&#x27; internal state during the learning process. This is in contrast to a conventional discrete state machine where the objective is to have a clear understanding of the internal state of the machine at every moment during the computation. The machine will be seen to be doing things that we often cannot make sense of or something that we consider to be completely random. Turing mentions that this specific character bestows upon a machine a certain degree of what we consider to be intelligence, in that intelligent behaviour consists of a deviation from the complete determinism of conventional computation but only so long as the deviation does not give rise to pointless loops or random behaviour.

:* The importance of random behaviour: Though Turing cautions us of random behaviour he mentions that inculcating an element of randomness in a learning machine would be of value in a system. He mentions that this could be of value where there might be multiple correct answers or ones where it might be such that a systematic approach would investigate several unsatisfactory solutions to a problem before finding the optimal solution which would entail the systematic process inefficient. Turing also mentions that the process of evolution takes the path of random mutations in order to find solutions that benefit an organism but he also admits that in the case of evolution the systematic method of finding a solution would not be possible.

Turing concludes by speculating about a time when machines will compete with humans on numerous intellectual tasks and suggests tasks that could be used to make that start. Turing then suggests that abstract tasks such as playing chess could be a good place to start another method which he puts as &quot;..it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English.&quot;.

An examination of the development in artificial intelligence that has followed reveals that the learning machine did take the abstract path suggested by Turing as in the case of Deep Blue, a chess playing computer developed by IBM and one which defeated the world champion Garry Kasparov (though, this too is controversial) and the numerous computer chess games which can outplay most amateurs. As for the second suggestion Turing makes, it has been likened by some authors as a call to finding a simulacrum of human cognitive development. Such attempts at finding the underlying algorithms by which children learn the features of the world around them are only beginning to be made.

<doc id="404049" wikidata="Q783081" url="?curid=404049" title="Circular segment">
<text>In geometry, a circular segment or disk segment (symbol: ⌓) is a region of a disk which is &quot;cut off&quot; from the rest of the disk by a straight line. The complete line is known as a &quot;secant&quot;, and the section inside the disk as a &quot;chord&quot;.

More formally, a circular segment is a plane region bounded by a circular arc (of less than π radians by convention) and the circular chord connecting its endpoints.

== Formulae ==
Let &quot;R&quot; be the radius of the arc which forms part of the perimeter of the segment, &quot;θ&quot; the central angle subtending the arc in radians, &quot;c&quot; the chord length, &quot;s&quot; the arc length, &quot;h&quot; the sagitta (height) of the segment, &quot;d&quot; the apothem of the segment, and &quot;a&quot; the area of the segment.

Usually, chord length and height are given or measured, and sometimes the arc length as part of the perimeter, and the unknowns are area and sometimes arc length. These can&#x27;t be calculated simply from chord length and height, so two intermediate quantities, the radius and central angle are usually calculated first. 
=== Radius and central angle ===
The radius is:
:formula_1

The central angle is
:formula_2

=== Chord length and height ===
The chord length and height can be back-computed from radius and central angle by:

The chord length is
:formula_3
:formula_4
The sagitta is
:formula_5
The apothem is
:formula_6

=== Arc length and area ===
The arc length, from the familiar geometry of a circle, is
:formula_7 

The area &quot;a&quot; of the circular segment is equal to the area of the circular sector minus the area of the triangular portion (using the double angle formula to get an equation in terms of formula_8):

:formula_9

In terms of and ,

:formula_10

In terms of and ,

:formula_11

What can be stated is that as the central angle gets smaller (or alternately the radius gets larger), the area &quot;a&quot; rapidly and asymptotically approaches formula_12. If formula_13, formula_14 is a substantially good approximation.

If formula_15 is held constant, and the radius is allowed to vary, then we haveformula_16

As the central angle approaches π, the area of the segment is converging to the area of a semicircle, formula_17, so a good approximation is a delta offset from the latter area: 

:formula_18 for h&gt;.75&quot;R&quot;

As an example, the area is one quarter the circle when &quot;θ&quot; ~ 2.31 radians (132.3°) corresponding to a height of ~59.6% and a chord length of ~183% of the radius.

=== Etc. ===
The perimeter &quot;p&quot; is the arclength plus the chord length,

:formula_19

As a proportion of the whole area of the disc, formula_20, you have

:formula_21

== Applications ==
The area formula can be used in calculating the volume of a partially-filled cylindrical tank lying horizontally.

In the design of windows or doors with rounded tops, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;h&quot; may be the only known values and can be used to calculate &quot;R&quot; for the draftsman&#x27;s compass setting.

One can reconstruct the full dimensions of a complete circular object from fragments by measuring the arc length and the chord length of the fragment.

To check hole positions on a circular pattern. Especially useful for quality checking on machined products.

For calculating the area or locating the centroid of a planar shape that contains circular segments.

<doc id="404052" wikidata="Q7647974" url="?curid=404052" title="Susan Howe">
<text>Susan Howe (born June 10, 1937) is an American poet, scholar, essayist, and critic, who has been closely associated with the Language poets, among other poetry movements. Her work is often classified as Postmodern because it expands traditional notions of genre (fiction, essay, prose and poetry). Many of Howe&#x27;s books are layered with historical, mythical, and other references, often presented in an unorthodox format. Her work contains lyrical echoes of sound, and yet is not pinned down by a consistent metrical pattern or a conventional poetic rhyme scheme.

Howe received the 2017 Robert Frost Medal awarded by the Poetry Society of America, and the 2011 Bollingen Prize in American Poetry. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Personal life==
Howe was born on June 10, 1937, in Boston, Massachusetts. She grew up in nearby Cambridge. Her mother, Mary Manning, was an Irish playwright and acted for Dublin&#x27;s Gate Theatre. Manning was a close friend of Samuel Beckett, with whom she had a brief affair a year before Susan was born; this led to a rumour that Beckett might be her biological father, although Susan Howe has stated that DNA tests show Beckett was not her father. Her father Mark De Wolfe Howe, was a professor at Harvard Law School and became the official biographer of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Her aunt Helen Howe was a monologuist and novelist. Howe has two younger sisters, Fanny Howe, who is also a poet; and Helen Howe Braider. Howe graduated from the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts in 1961. 

Howe married painter Harvey Quaytman in 1961; they had met at the art school. They separated when their daughter was young. Howe and her daughter lived with sculptor David von Schlegell for several years before the couple married. They were together until his death in 1992. The widowed poet married again, to Peter Hewitt Hare, a philosopher and professor at the University of Buffalo. He died in January 2008. 

Howe has two grown children, painter R.H. Quaytman, and writer Mark von Schlegell. She lives in Guilford, Connecticut.

==Publications==
Howe is an author of a number of books of poetry, including &quot;Europe of Trusts: Selected Poems&quot; (1990), &quot;Frame Structures: Early Poems 1974−1979&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Midnight&quot; (2003), &quot;Pierce-Arrow&quot; (1999), &quot;Bed Hangings&quot; with Susan Bee (2001),&quot;Souls of the Labadie Track,&quot; (2007) &quot;Frolic Architecture,&quot; (2010), &quot;Spontaneous Particulars: The Telepathy of Archives&quot; (2014) and &quot;That This&quot; (2010), and three books of criticism, &quot;The Birth-Mark: Unsettling the Wilderness in American Literary History&quot; (1993), &quot;The Gorgeous Nothings: Emily Dickinson&#x27;s Envelope Poems&quot; (2013) and &quot;My Emily Dickinson&quot; (1985). Howe began publishing poetry with &quot;Hinge Picture&quot; in 1974 and was initially received as a part of the amorphous grouping of experimental writers known as the language poets-writers such as Charles Bernstein, Bruce Andrews, Lyn Hejinian, Carla Harryman, Barrett Watten, and Ron Silliman. Her work has appeared in numerous anthologies, including The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry, the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry anthology &quot;In the American Tree,&quot; and The Norton Anthology of Postmodern Poetry.

In 2003, Howe started collaborating with experimental musician David Grubbs. The results were released on five CD&#x27;s: &quot;Thiefth&quot; (featuring the poems &quot;Thorow&quot; and &quot;Melville&#x27;s Marginalia&quot;), &quot;Songs of the Labadie Tract&quot;, &quot;Frolic Architecture&quot;, &quot;Woodslippercounterclatter&quot;, and &quot;Concordance&quot;.

==Other activities==
After graduating from high school, Howe spent a year in Dublin as an apprentice at the Gate Theatre. After graduating from the Boston Museum School in 1961, she moved to New York, where she painted. In 1975, she began to produce a series of poetry programs for WBAI/Pacifica Radio. In 1988 she had her first visiting professorship in English at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, becoming a full professor and core faculty of the Poetics Program in 1991, later being appointed Capen Chair and Distinguished Professor. She retired in 2006. Recently, Howe has held the following positions: Distinguished Fellow, Stanford Institute of the Humanities; faculty, Princeton University, University of Chicago, University of Utah, and Wesleyan University (English Department&#x27;s Distinguished Visiting Writer, 2010–11).

==Awards==
Susan Howe was awarded with the American Book Awards organized by the Before Columbus Foundation in both 1981 and 1986. &quot;She was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999 and a Chancellor of The Academy of American Poets in 2000.&quot; She was the fall 2009 Anna-Maria Kellen Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin. In 2009, she was awarded a Berlin Prize fellowship. In 2011, Howe was awarded the Yale Bollingen Prize in American Poetry.
