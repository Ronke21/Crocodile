<text>The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is an American federal agency operating in the Pacific Northwest. BPA was created by an act of Congress in 1937 to market electric power from the Bonneville Dam located on the Columbia River and to construct facilities necessary to transmit that power. Congress has since designated Bonneville to be the marketing agent for power from all of the federally owned hydroelectric projects in the Pacific Northwest. Bonneville is one of four regional Federal power marketing agencies within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).



==Operations==

The power generated on BPA&#x27;s grid is sold to public utilities, private utilities, and industry on the grid. The excess is sold to other grids in Canada, California and other regions. Because BPA is a public entity, it does not make a profit on power sales or from providing transmission services. BPA also coordinates with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to regulate flow of water in the Columbia River and to carry out environmental projects such as salmon restoration.

Although BPA is part of the DOE, it is self-funded and covers its costs by selling its products and services at cost. The BPA provides about 28% of the electricity used in the region. BPA transmits and sells wholesale electricity in eight western states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, and California. Its minimum wholesale rate is 3.49 cents per kilowatt-hour; the BPA generated $4.72 billion in operating revenue in 2022.

BPA now markets the electricity from thirty-one federal hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River and its tributaries, as well as from the Columbia Generating Station, a nuclear plant located on the Hanford Site in eastern Washington. BPA has more than of electrical lines and 261 substations in the Pacific Northwest and controls approximately 75 percent of the high-voltage (230 kV and higher) transmission capacity in the region. 87 percent of the agency&#x27;s sustained peak capacity (11,680 MW) is generated from hydroelectricity.

BPA also maintains connection lines with other power grids. It connects to the California high-voltage transmission system by Path 66, which consists of the two 500 kV AC lines of the Pacific AC Intertie, plus a third 500 kV AC line of the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) (managed by the Balancing Authority of Northern California). Together these three lines are operated as the California-Oregon Intertie (COI) (managed by the California Independent System Operator CAISO). An additional DC ±500 kV line, the Pacific DC Intertie, links BPA&#x27;s grid at the Celilo Converter Station near The Dalles, Oregon to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) grid 800 miles (1,300 km) away at the Sylmar Converter Station in Los Angeles.

The Northern Intertie crosses the Canada–US border in two locations at Blaine, Washington and Nelway, British Columbia and connects to two BC Hydro AC 500 kV lines and several lower voltage lines.

Because BPA owns and operates transmission equipment and locations, its workers perform its own vegetation management.

BPA uses helicopters to sling load maintenance workers inspecting and repairing power lines.

==Facilities and projects==

The BPA is the designated marketer for 31 hydroelectric dams and the Columbia Generating Station, a nuclear power plant at the Hanford Site. The dams are owned and operated by either the Army Corps of Engineers (21 dams) or the Bureau of Reclamation (10 dams).

==History==

The Bonneville Project, named for the then-new Bonneville Dam, was established by an act of Congress that was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 20, 1936. The federal agency was created to market electricity from the Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams based on the model of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). It would provide a flat rate for customer utilities and use revenue from these sales to pay off the bonds used by the federal government to finance the construction of dams in the Pacific Northwest. The agency&#x27;s name was changed to the Bonneville Power Administration in 1940. Attempts to replace the BPA with a Columbia Valley Authority that more closely resembled the TVA were made in the 1940s and 1950s, but were ultimately unsuccessful.

BPA&#x27;s first industrial sale was to Alcoa in January 1940, to provide 32,500 kilowatts of power. This, and the following 162,500 kilowatt order, led to complaints of the Bonneville Power Act&#x27;s anti-monopoly clause. The cheap price of aluminum from Alcoa helped aluminum sales grow in the post-World War II market.

Overly optimistic estimates of future electricity consumption by BPA in the 1960s led the agency to guarantee some bonds for the disastrous Washington Public Power Supply System nuclear power project. Out of five nuclear power plants started (WNP-1 and WNP-4, WNP-3 and WNP-5), only WNP-2 was completed. BPA is still making payments on three of the abandoned plants. In 2003, BPA&#x27;s debt for the nuclear project totaled $6.2 billion.

In 1973, the BPA commissioned TRW Inc. to write software for the PDP-10 mainframe computer that managed the agency&#x27;s power grid; Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote the software for the monitoring system, which remained in operation until its replacement in 2013.

In 2014, the BPA Library discovered a collection of old films made by the agency and began posting digital versions of them on the agency&#x27;s website. Included in the collection is the award-winning documentary &quot;River of Power&quot; which covers the Agency&#x27;s history from its beginning to the present.

The BPA gives its name to the BPA Trail in Federal Way, Washington, a walking trail built beneath power transmission lines.

<doc id="406339" wikidata="Q250912" url="?curid=406339" title="The Crow (1994 film)">
<text>The Crow is a 1994 American superhero film directed by Alex Proyas and written by David J. Schow and John Shirley, based on the 1989 comic book series by James O&#x27;Barr. It stars Brandon Lee in his final film role, as Eric Draven, a rock musician who is resurrected from the dead to seek vengeance against the gang who murdered him and his fiancée.

Lee was fatally wounded by a prop gun during filming. As he had finished most of his scenes, the film was completed through script rewrites, a stunt double and digital effects. After Lee&#x27;s death, Paramount Pictures opted out of distribution and the rights were acquired by Miramax Films. The film is dedicated to Lee and his fiancée, Eliza Hutton.

&quot;The Crow&quot; premiered in Santa Monica on May 10, 1994, and was released in the United States on May 13, 1994, by Dimension Films. The film received positive reviews for its style and Lee&#x27;s performance. It grossed $94 million on a $23 million budget and has gained a cult following. The success led to a media franchise that includes the sequels &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot; (1996), &quot;The Crow: Salvation&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Crow: Wicked Prayer&quot; (2005). The sequels, which mostly featured different characters and none of the original cast members, were unable to match the success of the first film. A reboot of &quot;The Crow&quot; was released in 2024, which was a critical and commercial failure.

==Plot==

On Devil&#x27;s Night, in a crime-ravaged and decrepit Detroit, a young woman, Shelly Webster, is raped and seriously wounded while her rock musician fiancé Eric Draven is shot and thrown to his death from the window of their loft apartment. Police Sergeant Daryl Albrecht accompanies Shelly to the hospital, but she eventually dies from her injuries. A narration states the legend of a crow that carries souls to the land of the dead; if the person died in tragic circumstances, the crow can resurrect their restless spirit to set things right.

One year later, Shelly&#x27;s and Eric&#x27;s graves are visited by Sarah, a young girl the pair cared for due to her absent mother. A crow lands on Eric&#x27;s gravestone and taps on it, resurrecting him. Disoriented and distressed, Eric returns to his ravaged loft apartment and experiences flashbacks of the murders: A gang of men—Tin Tin, Funboy, T-Bird, and Skank—targeted the pair, because they were protesting forced evictions in their apartment building which the gang&#x27;s leader, ruthless crime boss Top Dollar, intended to seize. Realizing that any injuries he suffers are immediately healed, Eric dons black-and-white face paint and sets out to avenge himself and Shelly, guided by the crow.

The crow leads Eric to Tin Tin, whom Eric stabs to death. He next travels to the pawn shop where Tin Tin had pawned Shelly&#x27;s engagement ring. Eric recovers the ring and blows up the shop, but spares the owner Gideon so he can alert Top Dollar&#x27;s men that Eric is coming for them. Albrecht begins investigating the apparent vigilante disturbances while Eric finds Funboy taking drugs with Sarah&#x27;s estranged drug addict mother, Darla. He gives Funboy a fatal overdose and purges the drugs from Darla&#x27;s body, telling her that Sarah needs her.

Eric visits Albrecht and confirms his suspicions regarding the vigilante&#x27;s identity. Albrecht tells Eric that he stayed with Shelly until she died, witnessing the thirty hours of suffering she experienced. Eric touches Albrecht, absorbing the pain Shelly felt. Later, Eric saves Sarah from being hit by a car, revealing to her that he has returned. Eric next targets T-Bird, killing him in an explosion. The following morning, Sarah and Darla reconcile and Sarah reunites with Eric at his apartment. Top Dollar holds a meeting with his associates to discuss his plans to burn the city to the ground on Devil&#x27;s Night. Eric arrives for Skank but a gunfight erupts, ending with Eric throwing Skank from a window to his death. Top Dollar, his lover and half-sister Myca, and his right-hand man Grange escape. Myca correctly hypothesizes that the crow is the source of Eric&#x27;s immortality.

Satisfied with his vengeance, Eric gifts Shelly&#x27;s engagement ring to Sarah and returns to his grave. Grange abducts Sarah as she is walking home and takes her to an abandoned church with Myca and Top Dollar, who takes Shelly&#x27;s ring. Eric is alerted to her plight by the crow and rushes to rescue her, but he is ambushed by Grange who wounds the crow, rendering Eric vulnerable. Albrecht arrives and kills Grange, while Myca attempts to take the crow for its immortality; it claws her eyes out, causing her to fall to her death from the bell tower. Top Dollar retreats to the church roof with Sarah, where he fights and badly wounds Eric. Eric transfers Shelly&#x27;s pain into Top Dollar, causing him to stumble off the roof and be impaled on a gargoyle, killing him.

Sarah and a wounded Albrecht are recovered from the church, while a pained Eric goes to Shelly&#x27;s grave where her spirit arrives to comfort him and return his body to rest. Sometime later, Sarah visits the graves and the crow returns Shelly&#x27;s ring to her.

==Production==
===Development===
James O&#x27;Barr wrote what would become &quot;The Crow&quot; as a means to cope with the unexpected death of his fiancée, who was killed by a drunk driver. The first meeting O&#x27;Barr had with a major studio was quickly dismissed after the studio&#x27;s vision for the film was a musical with Michael Jackson as the lead. Around the time of &quot;The Crow&quot;″s publication, writer John Shirley pitched &quot;Angry Angel&quot; to Caliber Press, who turned it down due to similarities with &quot;The Crow&quot;. Shirley sought the comic out and decided to adapt it into a film. O&#x27;Barr was receptive and agreed to workshop the film with Shirley and producer Jeff Most, turning down a significant offer from New Line Cinema in the process. O&#x27;Barr oversaw three different script treatments by Shirley and Most before directly collaborating on the first two drafts of the screenplay. Shirley penned the third and fourth draft by himself which awarded him screenplay credit by the Writers Guild of America. Most claimed to have written a &quot;substantial proportion&quot; of the script, but was denied credit due to a rule in the WGA which prohibited producers from receiving credit. The addition of producer Edward Pressman gave &quot;The Crow&quot; further momentum, but Shirley would be fired during development after clashing with a development head at Pressman&#x27;s studio. Splatterpunk writer David J. Schow was brought in for rewrites. From a suggestion by Most, Pressman primarily pursued music video and commercial directors to helm the film; Julien Temple being Most&#x27;s top choice. Australian filmmaker Alex Proyas was hired to direct the film. Paramount Pictures picked up the distribution rights and slotted an August 1993 release date.

River Phoenix and Christian Slater were early considerations for the role of Eric Draven. Shirley and Most pushed for Slater while Pressman wanted River Phoenix. Brandon Lee was suggested to play Draven, but O&#x27;Barr was unconvinced fearing he wouldn&#x27;t be suited for the material. However, Lee won O&#x27;Barr over and was given the role shortly thereafter. Lee dropped 20 pounds to portray Draven and worked closely with the crew to shape the film, co-choreographing his action sequences with Jeff Imada, performing most of his stunts, and removing a subplot due to its Asian stereotyping. Rochelle Davis, Ernie Hudson, Michael Wincott, Bai Ling, Sofia Shinas, Michael Massee, David Patrick Kelly, Tony Todd, and Jon Polito rounded out the supporting cast.

===Filming===
Production began on &quot;The Crow&quot; in February 1993 in Wilmington, North Carolina and was scheduled to last 54 days.

===Brandon Lee&#x27;s death===

On March 31, 1993, at EUE Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina, Lee was filming a scene where his character, Eric, is shot after witnessing the beating and rape of his fiancée. Actor Michael Massee&#x27;s character Funboy fires a .44 Magnum Smith &amp; Wesson Model 629 revolver at Lee as he walks into the room. A scene filmed two weeks before Lee&#x27;s had called for the same gun to be shown in close-up. Revolvers often use dummy cartridges fitted with bullets, but no powder or primer, during close-ups as they look more realistic than blank rounds which have no bullet. Instead of purchasing commercial dummy cartridges, the film&#x27;s prop crew, hampered by time and money constraints, created their own by pulling the bullets from live rounds, dumping the powder charge but not the primer, then reinserting the bullets. Witnesses reported that two weeks before Lee&#x27;s death they saw an unsupervised actor pulling the trigger on the gun while it was loaded with the powderless but primed round. Since the primer was still live, it could launch the bullet with enough force to push it out of the case and wedge it in the barrel.

In the fatal scene, which called for the revolver to be actually fired at Lee from a distance of 12–15 feet, the dummy cartridges were exchanged for blank rounds, which feature a live powder charge and primer, but no bullet, thus allowing the gun to be fired without the risk of an actual projectile. As the production company had sent the firearms specialist home early, responsibility for the guns was given to a prop assistant who was unaware of the rule for inspecting all firearms before and after any handling. Therefore, the barrel was not checked for obstructions when the time came to load it with the blank rounds. Since the bullet from the dummy round was already trapped in the barrel (a condition known as a squib load), this caused the .44 Magnum bullet to be fired out of the barrel with virtually the same force as if the gun had been loaded with a live round, and it struck Lee in the abdomen, mortally wounding him.

After Lee&#x27;s death, the producers were faced with the decision of whether or not to continue with the film. Lee had completed most of his scenes for the film and was scheduled to shoot for only three more days. The rest of the cast and crew, except for Ernie Hudson, whose brother-in-law had just died, stayed in Wilmington. Paramount Pictures, which was initially interested in distributing &quot;The Crow&quot; theatrically (originally a direct-to-video feature), opted out of involvement due to delays in filming and some controversy over the violent content being inappropriate given Lee&#x27;s death. However, Miramax picked it up with the intention of releasing it in theatres and injected a further $8 million to complete the production, taking its budget to approximately $23 million. The cast and crew then took a break for script rewrites of the flashback scenes that had yet to be completed. The script was rewritten by Walon Green, Terry Hayes, René Balcer, and Michael S. Chernuchin, adding narration and new scenes. Lee&#x27;s stunt double Chad Stahelski was used as a stand-in and digital face replacement was used to superimpose Lee&#x27;s face onto the head of the double. The beginning of the movie, which had not been finished, was rewritten, and the apartment scene remade using computer graphics from an earlier scene of Lee.

A character from the original comic book called Skull Cowboy was originally planned to be part of the adaptation and even had scenes filmed. He acted as a guide for Eric Draven between the worlds of the dead and the living. He was set to be played by Michael Berryman, but the role was cut from the film due to Lee&#x27;s death.

O&#x27;Barr later remarked that losing Lee was like losing his fiancée all over again, and he regretted ever writing the comic in the first place.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at number one in the United States in 1,573 theaters with $11,774,332 and averaging $7,485 per theater, making it Miramax&#x27;s biggest ever opening. Some industry sources believed that Miramax overstated the weekend gross by as much as $1 million. The film ultimately grossed $50,693,129 in the United States and Canada, and $43 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $93.7 million against its budget of $23 million. It ranked at number 24 for all films released in the US in 1994, the 24th highest-grossing film worldwide for 1994 and number 10 for R-rated films released that year.

In Europe, the film grossed £1,245,403 in the United Kingdom (where it was 18-rated), and sold 4,604,115 tickets in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. In Seoul, South Korea, it sold 83,126 tickets.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Crow&quot; has an approval rating of on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews and an average rating of . The critical consensus states: &quot;Filled with style and dark, lurid energy, &quot;The Crow&quot; is an action-packed visual feast that also has a soul in the performance of the late Brandon Lee.&quot; The film also has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Reviewers praised the action and visual style. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it a &quot;dazzling fever dream of a movie&quot;; Caryn James, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;a genre film of a high order, stylish and smooth&quot;; and Roger Ebert called it &quot;a stunning work of visual style&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film also.

Lee&#x27;s death was alleged to have a melancholic effect on viewers; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Lee &quot;haunts every frame&quot; and James Berardinelli called the film &quot;a case of &#x27;art imitating death&#x27;, and that specter will always hang over &quot;The Crow&quot;&quot;. Both Berardinelli and Howe called it an appropriate epitaph to Lee, and Ebert stated that not only was this Lee&#x27;s best film, but it was better than any of his father&#x27;s. Critics generally thought that this would have been a breakthrough film for Lee, although Berardinelli disagreed. The changes made to the film after Lee&#x27;s death were noted by reviewers, most of whom saw them as an improvement. Howe said that it had been transformed into something compelling. Berardinelli, although terming it a genre film, said that it had become more mainstream because of the changes.

The film was widely compared to other films, particularly Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; movies and Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Critics described &quot;The Crow&quot; as a darker film than the others; Ebert called it a grungier and more forbidding story than those of &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;it’s set in a generic inner city so hellish it makes Gotham City look like the Emerald City&quot;.

The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski and the production design by Alex McDowell were also praised. The cityscape designed by McDowell and the production team was described by McCarthy as rendered imaginatively. The film&#x27;s comic book origins were noted, and Ebert called it the best version of a comic book universe he had seen. McCarthy agreed, calling it &quot;one of the most effective live-actioners ever derived from a comic strip&quot;. Critics felt that the soundtrack complemented this visual style, calling it blistering, edgy and boisterous. Graeme Revell was praised for his &quot;moody&quot; score; Howe said that it &quot;drapes the story in a postmodern pall.&quot;

&quot;The Crow&quot; is mentioned in &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time; it ranked at number 468. It has since become a cult film.

==Soundtracks==

The original soundtrack album for &quot;The Crow&quot; features songs from the film, and was a chart-topping album. It included work by The Cure (their song, &quot;Burn&quot;, became the film&#x27;s main theme), The Jesus and Mary Chain, Rage Against the Machine and Helmet, among many others. In Peter Hook&#x27;s memoir &quot;Substance: Inside New Order&quot;, Hook relates that New Order were approached to provide the soundtrack for the film, with a cover of &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;, their hit as Joy Division, citing parallels between Eric&#x27;s resurrection and New Order&#x27;s formation after the suicide of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis. However, New Order frontman Bernard Sumner declined, stating that they were too busy with their album &quot;Republic&quot; to commit to another project. James O&#x27;Barr, creator of the original comic book series, was a big fan of Joy Division and had named the characters Sergeant Albrecht and Captain Hook after bandmates Sumner (who was also known as Bernard Albrecht early in his career) and Hook.

Several groups contributed covers. Nine Inch Nails rendered Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, Rollins Band covered Suicide&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; and Pantera performed Poison Idea&#x27;s &quot;The Badge&quot;.

The bands Medicine and My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult make cameo appearances in the film on stage in the nightclub below Top Dollar&#x27;s headquarters.

The score consists of original, mostly orchestral music, with some electronic and guitar elements, written for the film by Graeme Revell.

==Sequels==
In 1996, a sequel was released, called &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot;. In this film, Vincent Pérez plays Ashe Corven, who, along with his son Danny, is killed by criminals. Ashe is resurrected as a new Crow. The character of Sarah Mohr (now played by Mia Kirshner) reappears in this film and assists Ashe. The film also features Iggy Pop, who, according to the booklet insert for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, was the producer&#x27;s first choice for Funboy in the first Crow movie, but he was unable to commit due to his recording schedule. In addition, it also featured the final appearance of Thuy Trang. The band Deftones can be seen playing live in a festival scene and they contributed the song &quot;Teething&quot; to the soundtrack. The film received mostly negative reviews.

&quot;The Crow: Stairway to Heaven&quot; was a 1998 Canadian television series created by Bryce Zabel and starring Mark Dacascos in the lead role as Eric Draven.

The third film, &quot;The Crow: Salvation&quot;, was released in 2000. Directed by Bharat Nalluri, it stars Eric Mabius, Kirsten Dunst, Fred Ward, Jodi Lyn O&#x27;Keefe and William Atherton. It is loosely based on Poppy Z. Brite&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lazarus Heart&quot;. After its distributor cancelled the intended theatrical release due to &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot;″ negative critical reception, &quot;The Crow: Salvation&quot; was released directly to video with mixed reviews.

The fourth film, &quot;The Crow: Wicked Prayer&quot;, was released in 2005. Directed by Lance Mungia, it stars Edward Furlong, David Boreanaz, Tara Reid, Tito Ortiz, Dennis Hopper, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Danny Trejo. It was inspired by Norman Partridge&#x27;s novel of the same title. It had a one-week theatrical première on June 3, 2005, at AMC Pacific Place Theatre in Seattle, Washington, before being released to video on July 19, 2005. Like the other sequels, it had a poor critical reception.

&quot;The Crow: 2037&quot; was a planned sequel written and scheduled to be directed by Rob Zombie in the late 1990s; however, it was never made.

==Reboot==

On April 1, 2022, a new attempt at a remake was announced by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, with Bill Skarsgård starring as Eric, Rupert Sanders directing, and Edward R. Pressman and Malcolm Gray co-producing. Days later, the site also reported that FKA Twigs had been cast as Shelly. In July 2022, production on the reboot was reportedly underway in Prague, Czech Republic. By August 26, 2022, Danny Huston was cast as Vincent Roeg. On September 16, 2022, the film wrapped production. The film was theatrically released on August 23, 2024, by Lionsgate Films, in the United States.

The film received negative reviews and was declared a box-office bomb.

==Home media==
&quot;The Crow&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc multiple times between 1994 and 1998 in addition to the widescreen DVD on February 3, 1998. The two-disc DVD was released on March 20, 2001, as part of the Miramax/Dimension Collector&#x27;s Series. On October 18, 2011, &quot;The Crow&quot; was released on Blu-ray through Lionsgate Pictures who also re-released the DVD format on August 17, 2012. In Japan, the movie was remastered in 4K for a special edition in 2016, although the film&#x27;s final resolution was capped at 1080p; a 4K edition of the film was released on May 7, 2024.

<text>The University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNC Pembroke or UNCP) is a public university in Pembroke, North Carolina. UNC Pembroke is a master&#x27;s level degree-granting university and part of the University of North Carolina system. Its history is intertwined with that of the Lumbee nation.

==History==
The educational institution that developed into UNC Pembroke originates in the circumstances of the post-Civil War South. This school was a part of the effort of the Lumbee Nation in North Carolina to preserve their unique identity. Access and authority over their educational system were essential to retaining Lumbee culture, instilling a sense of pride, and improving the group&#x27;s economic and social conditions.

&quot;Croatan Normal School&quot; was created by the General Assembly on March 7, 1887, in response to a local petition sponsored by North Carolina Representative Hamilton McMillan of Robeson County. This event occurred in the context of competition for support between the Democratic and Republican parties in North Carolina. Hamilton MacMillan&#x27;s support for the school was connected to his interest and research on Native American history and culture. The school&#x27;s initial name, Croatan Normal School, was selected following the debatable view that this tribe included descendants of the Outer Banks Lost Colony of Sir Walter Raleigh.
The normal school opened in the spring of 1888 with one teacher and 15 students to train American Indian public school teachers. Initially, enrollment was limited to the American Indians of Robeson County. In this period, school enrollment was often quite limited among the general population. Funding by the state was patchy at best, and there was a high level of illiteracy. Forming a centralized training school for teachers was thought to be the best method of addressing this problem in the given circumstances.

In 1909, the school moved to its present location, about a mile east of the original site. The name was changed in 1911 to the &quot;Indian Normal School of Robeson County&quot;, and again in 1913 to the &quot;Cherokee Indian Normal School of Robeson County&quot;, tracking the legislature&#x27;s designation for the Indians of the county, who at one time claimed Cherokee descent. In 1926, the school became a two-year post-secondary normal school; until then, it had provided only primary and secondary instruction.

In 1939, it became a four-year institution; in 1941, it was renamed &quot;Pembroke State College for Indians&quot;. The following year, the school began to offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees in disciplines other than teaching. In 1945, the college was opened to members of all federally recognized tribes. A change of name to &quot;Pembroke State College&quot; in 1949 presaged the admission of white students, which was approved in 1953 for up to forty percent of total enrollment. The &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling the following year by the United States Supreme Court ended race restrictions at the college. Between 1939 and 1953, Pembroke State was the only state-supported four-year college for Native Americans in the United States.

In 1969, the college became &quot;Pembroke State University&quot;, a regional university incorporated into the University of North Carolina system in 1972. The first master&#x27;s degree program was implemented in 1978. On July 1, 1996, Pembroke State University became &quot;The University of North Carolina at Pembroke&quot;.

==Campus==

The university&#x27;s campus is located just north of Pembroke, directly behind N.C. Highway 711. Interstate 74 runs minutes from campus, as is Interstate 95. The center of campus is considered to be the Chavis University Center (often referred to as the University Center, or the UC). Students can bowl, play pool, and related games as well as socialize in the lounge. The dining hall and a fast-food outlet are located in the UC.

The UC lawn, an open grass area in front of the UC, is where students play amateur sports, read on benches, or use the area for free speech. The eastern side of campus includes the Livermore Library, Oxendine Science Building, Old Main, and Wellons Hall, among other buildings. The campus on the west side has the Business Administration Building, Education Center, and the residence hall communities such as Oak Hall, Pine Hall, North, and Belk. Lumbee Hall, the Dial Humanities building, the Sampson building, the Auxiliary building, the Jones Athletic Center, and the Givens Performing Arts Center make up most of the north end of campus.

The campus is home to Givens Performing Arts Center, a regional center for culture, arts, and entertainment. GPAC hosts numerous Broadway shows, orchestras, shows geared towards children, and also hosts the &quot;Distinguished Speaker Series,&quot; in cooperation with the Association of Campus Entertainment, which has brought in notable people such as Cory Booker, Bill Nye, Jodi Sweetin, Patch Adams, Gabby Douglas and Hill Harper, among many others.

==Organization==
The title of Principal or Superintendent was used prior to 1940. After 1940, when UNC Pembroke became a collegiate-level institution, the title of President was used. Upon becoming a member institution of the University of North Carolina system, the title was changed to Chancellor.

===Presidents===

* O. H. Browne (1940–1942)
* Ralph D. Wellons (1942–1956)
* Walter J. Gale (1956–1962)
* English E. Jones (1962–1972)

===Chancellors===
* English E. Jones (1972–1979)
* Paul R. Givens (1979–1989)
* Joseph B. Oxendine (1989–1999)
* Allen C. Meadors (1999–2009)

====Academics====


UNC Pembroke currently offers hundreds of pathways to graduate and undergraduate degrees and is organized into the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Health Sciences, McKenzie-Elliott School of Nursing, Thomas School of Business, School of Education, and The Graduate School.

==Students and faculty==
UNCP offers small class sizes; the student-to-faculty ratio is 18:1, and classes average 20 students. In addition, classes are taught exclusively by professors, instructors, or other faculty. There are no classes on campus taught by graduate assistants. The school has an enrollment of 8,319 students; of these, 6,318 students are undergraduate, and 2,001 are graduate students. The fall 2021 enrollment marks the fourth consecutive year of record enrollment growth. 

===Rankings===
The 2024 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks the University #45 in &quot;Regional Universities South&quot; and #19 in &quot;Top Public Schools.&quot; It is also ranked #16 in &quot;Best Colleges for Veterans&quot; and #10 in &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot;.

==Sports, clubs, and traditions==

===Athletics===


UNC Pembroke&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Braves. Due to its heritage as an institution founded by American Indians for the education of American Indians and the continued support from the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, the school has largely been immune to the ongoing controversies related to American Indian-themed nicknames and mascots.

The school is a member of the NCAA&#x27;s Division II and competes in Conference Carolinas and the Mountain East Conference. The school fields varsity sports teams for women and men. 

===Greek life and student organizations===
UNCP, as well as the Office of Greek Life and the Campus Engagement &amp; Leadership office, offers a variety of extracurricular activities for students. From academic-based and service organizations to minority organizations and Greek life, UNCP offers more than 100 organizations.

=== Media ===
While the Netflix show The Chair is situated in a Pembroke University, it is a fictional Ivy League University and not the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.

<doc id="406346" wikidata="Q2454190" url="?curid=406346" title="Tweedledum and Tweedledee">
<text>Tweedledum and Tweedledee are characters in an English nursery rhyme and in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1871 book &quot;Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There&quot;. Their names may have originally come from an epigram written by poet John Byrom. The nursery rhyme has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19800. The names have since become synonymous in western popular culture slang for any two people whose appearances and actions are identical.

==Lyrics==
Common versions of the nursery rhyme include:

:Tweedledum and Tweedledee
:    Agreed to have a battle;
:For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
:    Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

:Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
:    As black as a tar-barrel;
:Which frightened both the heroes so,
:    They quite forgot their quarrel.

==Origins==
The words &quot;Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum&quot; make their first appearance in print as names applied to the composers George Frideric Handel and Giovanni Bononcini in &quot;one of the most celebrated and most frequently quoted (and sometimes misquoted) epigrams&quot;, satirising disagreements between Handel and Bononcini, written by John Byrom (1692–1763): in his satire, from 1725.

:Some say, compar&#x27;d to Bononcini
:That Handel&#x27;s but a Ninny
:Others aver, that he to Handel
:Is scarcely fit to hold a Candle
:Strange all this Difference should be
:&#x27;Twixt Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee!

Although Byrom is clearly the author of the epigram, the last two lines have also been attributed to Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. While the familiar form of the rhyme was first printed in &quot;Original Ditties for the Nursery&quot; (c. 1805), Byrom may have drawn on an existing rhyme.

==&quot;Through The Looking-Glass&quot;==
The characters are perhaps best known from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass and what Alice Found There&quot; (1871). Carroll, having introduced two fat little men named Tweedledee and Tweedledum, quotes the nursery rhyme, which the two brothers then go on to enact. They agree to have a battle, but never have one. When they see a monstrous black crow swooping down, they take to their heels. The Tweedle brothers never contradict each other, even when one of them, according to the rhyme, &quot;agrees to have a battle&quot;. Rather, they complement each other&#x27;s words, which led John Tenniel to portray them as twins in his illustrations for the book.

==Other depictions==

* Tweedledee and Tweedledum appear in Disney&#x27;s 1951 version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, both voiced by J. Pat O&#x27;Malley, and representing the sun and moon as they tell Alice the story of The Walrus and the Carpenter, and the first stanza of the poem called, You Are Old, Father William before Alice quietly leaves to find the White Rabbit. They were seen again at the end of the film during the chase. The Disney versions of the characters later appeared in the Disney television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot; and one of them in the final scene of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.
*Tweedledee and Tweedledum appear in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland&quot;, portrayed by Ben Cotton and Matty Finochio. They appear as the Red Queen&#x27;s servants where they started out working for the Red King. While Tweedledum is shown to be loyal to the Red Queen, Tweedledee is shown to be loyal to Jafar.

<text>The Teacher in Space Project (TISP) was a NASA program announced by Ronald Reagan in 1984 designed to inspire students, honor teachers, and spur interest in mathematics, science, and space exploration. The project would carry teachers into space as payload specialists (non-astronaut civilians), who would return to their classrooms to share the experience with their students.

NASA cancelled the program in 1990, following the death of its first participant, Christa McAuliffe, in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster (STS-51-L) on January 28, 1986. NASA replaced Teachers in Space in 1998 with the Educator Astronaut Project, which required its participants to become astronaut Mission Specialists. The first Educator Astronauts were selected as part of NASA Astronaut Group 19 in 2004.

Barbara Morgan, who was selected as a mission specialist as part of NASA Astronaut Group 17 in 1998, has often been incorrectly referred to as an Educator Astronaut. However, she was selected as a mission specialist before the Educator Astronaut Project.

==NASA programs==
TISP was announced by President Ronald Reagan on August 27, 1984. Not members of NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Corps, the teachers would fly as Payload Specialists and return to their classrooms after flight. More than 40,000 applications were mailed to interested teachers while 11,000 teachers sent completed applications to NASA. Each application included a potential lesson that would be taught from space while on the Space Shuttle. The applications were sorted and then sent to the various State Departments of Education, who were then responsible for narrowing down their state applicants to a final set of two each. These 114 applicants were notified of their selections and were gathered together for further selection processes down to ten finalists. These were then trained for a time, and in 1985 NASA selected Christa McAuliffe to be the first teacher in space, with Barbara Morgan as her backup. McAuliffe was a high school social studies teacher from Concord, New Hampshire. She planned to teach two 15-minute lessons from the Space Shuttle.

McAuliffe died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster (STS-51-L) on January 28, 1986. After the accident, Reagan spoke on national television and assured the nation that the Teacher in Space program would continue. &quot;We&#x27;ll continue our quest in space&quot;, he said. &quot;There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.&quot; However, NASA decided in 1990 that spaceflight was still too dangerous to risk the lives of civilian teachers, and eliminated the Teacher in Space project. Morgan returned to teaching in Idaho and later became a mission specialist on STS-118.

===Educator Astronaut Project===

In January 1998, NASA replaced the Teacher In Space project with the Educator Astronaut Project. Instead of training teachers for five months as Payload Specialists who would return to the classroom, the Educator Astronaut program required selectees to give up their teaching careers, move to Houston, and become Mission Specialists (full-time NASA astronauts).

The first three Educator Astronauts were selected in October 2004: Joseph Acaba, Richard Arnold and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger. Acaba and Arnold flew aboard STS-119 in March 2009, and Metcalf-Lindenburger on STS-131 in April 2010.

Although many sources including some NASA ones incorrectly refer to Barbara Morgan (who flew on STS-118 in August 2007) as the first Educator Astronaut, she was actually selected as a standard mission specialist in 1998, before the Educator Astronaut Project was in place.

==Private program==
In the early 21st century, the Teacher in Space project was revived in the private sector. The development of reusable, suborbital launch vehicles by commercial companies makes it possible for nonprofit groups to contemplate sending large numbers of teachers into space. The new Teachers in Space program began in 2005. In March 2005, Teacher in Space candidate Pam Leestma, a second-grade teacher and cousin of Space Shuttle astronaut David Leestma, completed a training flight aboard a MiG-21 operated by X-Rocket, LLC.

Armadillo Aerospace, Masten Space Systems, PlanetSpace, Rocketplane Limited, Inc., and XCOR Aerospace pledged flights to the new Teachers in Space project. Advisors to the new Teachers in Space project include SpaceShipOne builder and Ansari X-Prize winner Burt Rutan, X-Prize founder Peter Diamandis, Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin, and private astronaut and X-Prize sponsor Anousheh Ansari.

The United States Rocket Academy partnered with the SFF in 2006, and worked to draft rules for a &quot;pathfinder&quot; competition to select the first Teachers in Space. The rules were announced at the Wirefly X PRIZE Cup Competition held at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, New Mexico in October 2007. Applications were accepted until November 4, 2008. On July 20, 2009, Teachers in Space announced its first group of &quot;Pathfinders&quot;: astronaut teacher candidates.

On June 11, 2013, Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University&#x27;s new Commercial Space Operations degree program, the first of its kind in the world, announced they will sponsor the Teachers in Space summer workshops for the next five years, indicating their intent toward a continuing long term relationship as well as their sharing a vision to &quot;...help students, teachers and organizers collaborate in bringing space education to every level, from K-12 to graduate programs.&quot;

In 2014, Program director Elizabeth Kennick incorporated the Teachers in Space project as an educational nonprofit in New York, spinning it off from the Space Frontier Foundation. Five original Pathfinders (James Kuhl, Rachael Manzer, Lanette Oliver, Chantelle Rose, and Michael Schmidt) remain with the program, also Vice President Joe Latrell and several teacher volunteers. Teachers in Space, Inc. has now flown two teacher/student designed experiments to International Space Station (ISS), launched and retrieved several high altitude balloons with data sensors, put teachers through astronaut training experiences including hypobaric chamber and centrifuge, and delivered weeklong professional development workshops for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) teachers in California, Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, and Georgia.

<doc id="406360" wikidata="Q202529" url="?curid=406360" title="Bedivere">
<text>Bedivere ( or ; ; ; , also Bedevere and other spellings) is one of the earliest characters to be featured in the legend of King Arthur, originally described in several Welsh texts as the one-handed great warrior named Bedwyr Bedrydant. Arthurian chivalric romances, inspired by his portrayal in the chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, portray Bedivere as a Knight of the Round Table of King Arthur who serves as Arthur&#x27;s marshal and is frequently associated with his brother Lucan and his cousin Griflet as well as with Kay. In the English versions, Bedivere notably assumes Griflet&#x27;s hitherto traditional role from French romances as the one who eventually returns Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake after Arthur&#x27;s last battle.

== Bedwyr ==
In early Welsh sources, Bedwyr Bedrydant (&quot;Bedwyr of the Perfect Sinew&quot;) is a handsome, one-handed warrior under Arthur&#x27;s command. His father is given as Pedrawd or Bedrawd, and his children as Amhren and Eneuawg, both members of Arthur&#x27;s court.

One of the earliest direct references to Bedwyr can be found in the 10th-century poem &quot;Pa gur&quot; which recounts the exploits of a number of Arthur&#x27;s men, including Bedwyr, Cei (Kay) and Manawydan. Of Bedwyr, this narrative says:

The 9th-century version of &quot;Englynion y Beddau&quot; (&quot;The Stanzas of the Graves&quot;) gives Bedwyr&#x27;s final resting place on Tryfan. In the hagiography of Cadoc, Bedwyr is alongside Arthur and Cei in dealing with King Gwynllyw of Gwynllwg&#x27;s abduction of Gwladys from her father&#x27;s court in Brycheiniog. A possible allusion to Bedwyr could be found in the reference to Bedwyr&#x27;s well in the 9th-century &quot;Marwnad Cadwallon ap Cadfan&quot;. The Welsh Triads name Bedwyr as &quot;Battle-Diademed&quot;, and a superior to Drystan (Tristan), Hueil mab Caw and even Cei. A catchphrase often quipped by Cei, &quot;by the hand of my friend&quot; is possibly a reference to Bedwyr&#x27;s disability.

Bedwyr is a prominent character in the tale of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, in which he appears at the head of Arthur&#x27;s court list with his friend Cei and is described as one of the most handsome men in the world (save for Arthur and Drych fab Cibddar), and is the wielder of a magical spear with the ability to separate the tip of the shaft to attack and that all the wounds caused by the spear were equal to nine wounds. He is called upon to accompany Culhwch on his quest to win Olwen&#x27;s hand in marriage and is the first to strike the giant Ysbaddaden with the poisoned spear meant for Culhwch. Bedwyr goes on to assist Culhwch in completing the impossible tasks given to him by Ysbaddaden; he helps Cei and Goreu fab Custennin kill Wrnach the Giant, rescues Mabon ap Modron from his imprisonment, retrieves the hairs of Dillus the Bearded, captures the Cauldron of Diwrnach during Arthur&#x27;s raid on Ireland, and takes part in the hunting of the monstrous boar Twrch Trwyth with Arthur&#x27;s dog Cavall at his side. The tale ends with the completion of the tasks, the humiliation and death of Ysbaddaden, and the marriage of Culhwch and Olwen.

== Bedivere ==
Bedivere is one of Arthur&#x27;s loyal allies in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and maintains this position in much later Arthurian literature. He helps Arthur and Kay fight the Giant of Mont Saint-Michel, and joins Arthur in his war against Emperor Lucius of Rome, in which he dies fighting. In Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, &#x27;Bedwyr&#x27; (as he is initially known) plays a similar role against the Giant, before disappearing from the text to return rather ingloriously as Sir Bedivere to accompany Arthur at his end. In the original French romances, the later role belonged to his cousin, Griflet.

In several English versions of Arthur&#x27;s death, including Malory&#x27;s, the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; and the Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot;, Bedivere and Arthur are among the few survivors of the Battle of Camlann (or of Salisbury). After the battle, at the request of the mortally wounded king, Bedivere casts away the sword Excalibur that Arthur had received from the Lady of the Lake. However, he does this only after twice thinking the sword too valuable to Britain to throw into the water. When he reports that nothing in particular happened, King Arthur admonishes him, for Arthur knows that the mystical sword would create some supernatural event. Finally, Bedivere casts the sword into the water, at which a hand arises and catches the sword mid-air, then sinks into the waters, and Arthur is thus assured that the sword has been returned. In Malory&#x27;s telling, this act summons Morgan and Nimue, who take the king to Avalon. Upon the presumed death of Arthur, Bedivere enters a hermitage led by the Mordred-ousted Archbishop of Canterbury, where he spends the remainder of his life. There he will be joined by Lancelot and some of his kindred knights, who will resort to it in their own penitence.

==Modern fiction==
Some modern authors such as Rosemary Sutcliff (&quot;Sword at Sunset&quot;), Gillian Bradshaw (&quot;Hawk of May&quot;), and Mary Stewart (&quot;The Merlin Trilogy&quot;) give him Lancelot&#x27;s traditional role as Guinevere&#x27;s lover, Lancelot having been added to the cycle too late to seem historical. 

*In the 1975 comedy film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, the ironically-named Sir Bedevere the Wise (played by Terry Jones) is regarded as brilliant at science by other characters, but his methods revolve around absurd theories such as the Earth being banana-shaped and witches burning and floating on water because they are made of wood. He devises a Trojan Horse styled scheme with a big wooden rabbit to get inside a French fortress, but overlooks the crucial detail of Arthur and the knights actually being inside it. He is also adorned in a comically large, cylindrical helmet with a gate-like visor that he frequently lifts throughout the film.
*In John Boorman&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Excalibur&quot;, Percival replaces Bedivere as the knight that returns the sword to the Lady of the Lake.
*Bedivere is the main character in the 1994 novel &quot;Grailblazers&quot; by Tom Holt.
*Although he plays a minor part in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot;, many of his legendary deeds (such as throwing Excalibur into the lake; or in Cornwell&#x27;s story, the sea) are carried out instead by the protagonist, Derfel Cadarn. Derfel too loses one of his hands and then fights one-armed during the final act of &quot;&quot; (1997).
*He appears in Philip Reeve&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Here Lies Arthur&quot; as Bedwyr and befriends the main character Gwyn. He is Arthur&#x27;s half-sister&#x27;s younger son, the older being Medrawt (Mordred). He is murdered by Arthur, for betrayal with Arthur&#x27;s wife, Gwenhwyfar (Guinevere), in a similar role to the later Lancelot. This causes a family rift with Medrawt, who takes revenge by raising an army and attacking Arthur, killing him, and taking the city of Aquae Sulis (ruled by Arthur) for himself.
*Sir Bedivere has a cameo in the 2008 BBC series &quot;Merlin&quot; in the episode &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, in which he is killed by the Questing Beast.
*Bedivere appears in the video game and visual novel &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; in an epilogue, during the game&#x27;s version of Artoria&#x27;s death. He also appears in the mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; as a character summonable by the protagonist, notably from a version of the Arthurian tale where he fails in delivering Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake, inadvertently stopping King Arthur from going to Avalon. In the anime adaptation by Studio Deen, the character is voiced by Mamiko Noto, a female voice actress and is thus interpreted by some to be female.
*Bedivere appears as the final boss of the Avalonian Dungeon in the MMORPG &quot;Albion Online&quot; as &quot;Lord Bedivere&quot;.
*In Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot;, Djimon Hounsou plays Sir Bedivere, the leader of the resistance and a former knight of Uther.
* Bedivere features as one of the main characters of Lev Grossman&#x27;s 2024 novel &quot;The Bright Sword&quot;, where he is Arthur&#x27;s closest companion and secretly in love with Arthur.

<text>The China–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA) is a bilateral treaty between Australia and China that aims to protect migratory birds and their environment between the two countries. Throughout all six Articles, the treaty defines what a migratory bird is, outlines key prohibitions for both contracting parties and determines the responsibilities of both nations to protect migratory birds and their habitats. The CAMBA was first developed on 20 October 1986, and came into force on 1 September 1988. Eighty-one bird species are listed in the agreement, as shown in the CAMBA Annex listed below.

The CAMBA was developed to provide more legal protection for migratory birds, especially those that are critically endangered or are at threat of extinction. Both China and Australia have agreed to encourage the creation of programs to support the protection of bird species, to share any information like research on these birds and to ensure conservation such as by preventing the importation of hazardous plants and animals.

Australia has been involved with other migratory bird agreements such as the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA) and the Republic of Korea-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (ROKAMBA), and also with management plans that aim to combat key threats such as climate change and water extraction which have proven to harm bird species. There are also issues associated with migratory bird protection which limits the effectiveness of protecting these species, including the lack of specificity in agreements and difficulties in implementing conservatory measures at a domestic level.

== Agreement articles ==

=== Article I ===
Article I defines the term &quot;migratory bird&quot; as a bird that is sufficiently proven to be migrating between China and Australia and those determined by &quot;published reports, photographs and other information&quot;. This Article then states that both contracting parties, being Australia and China, must review the Annex and are given the ability to potentially amend the Agreement upon mutual agreement. This Article provides opportunities for both contracting parties to amend the CAMBA which has occurred before at the 7th Consultative Meeting between Australia and China on 26 May 2006. The amendments included altering the scientific nomenclature of 17 species in the Annex as well adding the Roseate Tern and removing the Painted Snipe.

=== Article II ===
Article II prohibits both China and Australia from taking either migratory birds or their eggs unless otherwise permitted in the domestic laws of the respective country given certain circumstances. Some of these circumstances include if such actions are for: &quot;scientific, educational, propagative&quot; or other purposes that align with the motives of the Agreement, the reason is to protect people or property or it is during hunting season as established in Article II. For instance, the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment has permitted Tasmanian Aboriginal individuals to harvest shearwaters, which is a historic part of their muttonbirding tradition. This Article further states that both parties shall not sell, purchase or exchange migratory birds or eggs, but may determine a criterion for hunting these birds given reproduction rates needed for survival. During the 2010 to 2011 and 2013 to 2014 breeding seasons, cultural harvesting for Tasmanian Aboriginals was terminated to ensure bird populations returned to their original levels.

=== Article III ===
Article III lists three binding statements that both contracting parties are recommended to do. The first states that both nations are encouraged to share information related to the research on migratory birds. The second encourages both parties to create &quot;joint research programs&quot; focused on migratory birds. Lastly, both parties should promote the protection of migratory birds, specifically those that are exposed to extinction. The National Avian Influenza Wild Bird (NAIWB) Surveillance Program is an Australian initiative that includes sampling Anseriformes to monitor influenza viruses. This program provides information to better improve Australia&#x27;s understanding of avian influenza in wild birds to protect against environmental and social impacts of diseases.

=== Article IV ===
Article IV asserts that both contracting parties must, to the best of their ability: create facilities that protect migratory birds, take necessary steps to preserve and improve the environment of these birds, prevent any harm to both the birds and their environment and monitor and control any animals or plants that are imported that may pose a risk. In preventing harm and improving the environments of the listed birds, Australia and China considered removing the Painted Snipe from the Annex as they were found to be a different species than those that were in Asia. However, it is already a threatened species listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) and was found that it will not lessen the protection to that species and its environment.

=== Article V ===
This Article simply states that if either China or Australia request so, both parties must consult in relation to the operation of the Agreement.

=== Article VI ===
Article VI outlines that the Agreement will be enacted once both countries notify one another and sign the Agreement. It will be in force for 15 years and either party can give the other party 1 year&#x27;s notice to terminate the Agreement after this period of time.
== Australia&#x27;s migratory bird protection history ==
Australia has been a critical nation in protecting migratory birds by taking conservatory measures in the East Asian – Australasian Flyway since the mid-1970s. Australia has made bilateral migratory bird agreements with several Asian countries. It started with Japan (JAMBA) in 1974, China (CAMBA) in 1986 and the Republic of Korea (ROKAMBA) over 15 years ago in 2006.

As well as these bilateral agreements, Australia is a signatory to the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, more commonly known as the Ramsar Convention. This intergovernmental treaty primarily focuses on the conservation of wetlands by ensuring environmental maintenance and ecological sustainability. The Ramsar Strategic Plan (2009–2015) outlines outcomes to be achieved for the Ramsar Convention. First, there should be an increase in engagement within local communities and awareness of the importance of wetlands on ecosystems. Second, international coordination with the Ramsar Convention must be maintained to achieve an international wetland network. Thirdly, there should be a focus on cooperating with international parties to maximise the impact of the agreement.

Further, as a member since 2006, Australia&#x27;s membership in the East Asian – Australasian Flyway Site Network which was established in 1996 has assisted the encouragement and implementation of more effective conservatory measures for migratory birds. Also, Australia is part of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals which is an environmental treaty as part of the United Nations which aims to improve international coordination of migratory bird conservation.

In more recent developments according to The Australian Government Department of the Environment and Energy, Australia has demonstrated initiatives interlinked with their commitment to agreements with Japan, China and Korea. The introduction of the Wildlife Conservation Plan for Migratory Shorebirds is a national framework focused on the research and development of migratory shorebirds within Australia. The EPBC Act 1999 has assisted the development of the Conservation Plan to facilitate the survival of bird species. The protection of habitats has been amplified by the National Landcare Programme as well as through coordinating measures with the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office, Parks Australia and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.

== Reasons for migratory bird protection ==

Evaluation of shorebird populations trends in eastern Australia has shown to have plummeted by 79% across 24 years. As Australia provides a habitat for millions of migratory birds yearly, there is a constant need for protection to prevent extinction and sustain ecosystems.

The decline in inland wetlands within Australia is another threat to migratory birds and a key reason for such agreements. Inland wetlands provide nutrients to surrounding water bodies and resultantly improve birdlife due to the nutrient-abundant habitats. Due to climate change and water-resource use, inland wetlands have declined and posed a risk to bird species that heavily rely on those habitats. Migratory bird agreements are created to ensure appropriate steps are taken to ensure the protection of bird environments, such as the role of the CAMBA in terminating contracting parties for bringing plants and animals that may be &quot;hazardous to the preservation of migratory birds and their environment&quot;.

Climate change is a major threat posed towards bird species given their sensitivity towards slight weather changes. Changes in climates and global warming not only influence the timing in migration, but also plant diversity in key habitual areas for birds due to processes like eutrophication which result in higher levels of nitrogen present in water. The increase in agricultural efforts has worsened ecosystems due to environmentally unfriendly and unfeasible processes such as the use of chemicals, as well as eutrophication. Rising sea levels is a threat to species that live around coastal lines and increases in forest fires is reducing bird populations due to the effects of climate change. Although there are moderate levels of responses to this specific issue, the increase in awareness and danger of climate change has meant there will be a greater need for more effective responses.

Migratory bird agreements play an important role in protecting and conserving migratory birds and their habitats by outlining both the birds that are protected and the clauses that determine what action contracting parties should be undertaking. Most migratory bird agreements highlight the birds that are protected such as that of the Annex in the CAMBA to ensure specificity and to monitor which birds are being protected over time as treaties like the CAMBA may be amended. For instance, in May 2015, the Eastern Curlew and Curlew Sandpiper were both listed as critically endangered, both of which are listed in the Annex. However, two-thirds of Australia&#x27;s migratory birds remain unprotected under national protection, reflecting the need for further protection on this issue alongside the CAMBA.

== Issues ==
Several issues influence the need for migratory bird protection such as the CAMBA. The top threats include agriculture, aquaculture, biological resource use and natural system modifications. There is a range of other threats such as shooting, poisoning and electrocution which have all been identified for several years but the impact of these have worsened over time. Another frequent issue is derived from land-use constraints as a result of an increase in population and economic development. Land threat types include over-grazing, afforestation and burning or fire. Some issues go beyond the conventional dilemmas identified and are legally related, such as the pitfalls in international agreements. These include gaps in the listing of international migrants, national migrants and other legal mechanisms that aim to conserve migratory birds.

The increase in regulation on rivers and other water bodies is an issue with current migratory bird agreements. The CAMBA recognises laws and regulation as an exception from prohibiting the taking of birds and eggs while encouraging both parties to take measures to protect the environments of these birds. Although, many international agreements fail to recognise river regulation. The Murray-Darling Basin for example is largely regulated and experienced some of the largest declines in shorebird populations. Given the size of the Murray-Darling Basin water system, its impact on bird populations has proven to negatively influence ecosystems due to the increase in extraction, regulation and other harmful actions.

The complexity of multilateral treaties is another issue that worsens the effectiveness of protection measures. There is sophistication surrounding decision-making and implementation given the nature of multinational agreements as individual nations have different attitudes towards treaties. Legislation protecting specific areas are limited due to political jurisdictions but contrasts with the nature of migratory species being highly cross-jurisdictional. This national complexity given legal and political barriers makes migratory bird protection harder to implement and measure effectiveness. There has proven to be a greater need for harmonisation between state and federal responses by leveraging the EPBC Act 1999 through integrating it within the legislation to improve coordination. The complexity of treaties is evident through the implicit language used when defining key terms and often requires other legislation to provide more substantive details to support state governments in upholding protective measures. Response mechanisms such as the Ramsar Convention are seen as limited in their purpose of responding to migratory bird protection compared to migratory bird agreements such as the CAMBA, given the lack of detail and explicitness within the agreements. For instance, the Ramsar Convention focuses on the registration of wetland sites while migratory bird treaties have a greater focus on migratory birds in general.

A limitation of migratory bird migration within Australia, as demonstrated by the CAMBA and other bilateral treaties, is that the national government can implement international agreements, with states tending to employ their own regulations and laws. As a major piece of legislation at the national level, the EPBC Act 1999 lists all species under Australia&#x27;s migratory agreements which have allowed for further management plans to be enacted. Examples include the Threat Abatement Plan for the incidental catch of seabirds during oceanic longline fishing operations and the Wildlife Conservation Plan for Migratory Shorebirds. The lack of current international agreements with countries where bird migration is prominent, such as with Indonesia or Papua New Guinea, has meant that those bird species remain largely unprotected. Despite international agreements, some countries that are involved in bird migration such as shorebirds that follow the Asian-Australasian Flyway, are not parties to an international instrument that aims to protect these species. Although, this does not occur for all international agreements, with the CAMBA shown to be effective by offering site managers in China training as part of the treaty. The involvement of the public in improving the protection of migratory birds is often limited too given the heavy reliance of the government on bilateral agreements. As governments tend to work with other stakeholders to integrate supportive measures, the government themselves do not tend to instigate any actions surrounding conversation.

<text>Indonesian cuisine is a collection of various regional culinary traditions that formed in the archipelagic nation of Indonesia. There are a wide variety of recipes and cuisines in part because Indonesia is composed of approximately 6,000 populated islands of the total 17,508 in the world&#x27;s largest archipelago, with more than 600 ethnic groups.

There are many regional cuisines, often based upon indigenous culture with some foreign influences.

== Tradition and characteristics ==
Indonesia has around 5,350 traditional recipes, with 30 of them considered the most important. Indonesia&#x27;s cuisine may include rice, noodle and soup dishes in modest local eateries to street-side snacks and top-dollar plates.

Indonesian cuisine varies greatly by region and has many different influences. Sumatran cuisine, for example, often has Middle Eastern and Indian influences, featuring curried meat and vegetables such as &quot;gulai&quot; and curry, while Javanese cuisine is mostly indigenous, with some hint of Chinese influence.

The cuisines of Eastern Indonesia are similar to Polynesian and Melanesian cuisine. Elements of Chinese cuisine can be seen in Indonesian cuisine: foods such as noodles, meat balls, spring rolls, and wontons have been completely assimilated.

Throughout its history, Indonesia has been involved in trade due to its location and natural resources. Additionally, Indonesia&#x27;s indigenous techniques and ingredients were influenced by India, the Middle East, China, and finally Europe. Spanish and Portuguese traders brought New World produce even before the Dutch came to colonise most of the archipelago. The Indonesian islands the Moluccas (Maluku), which are famed as &quot;the Spice Islands&quot;, also contributed to the introduction of native spices, such as cloves and nutmeg, to Indonesian and global cuisine.

Indonesian cuisine often demonstrates complex flavour, acquired from certain ingredients and &quot;bumbu&quot; spices mixture. Indonesian dishes have rich flavours; most often described as savory, hot and spicy, and also combination of basic tastes such as sweet, salty, sour and bitter. Most Indonesians favour hot and spicy food, thus &quot;sambal&quot;, Indonesian hot and spicy chili sauce with various optional ingredients, notably shrimp paste, shallots, and others, is a staple condiment at all Indonesian tables. Seven main Indonesian cooking methods are frying, grilling, roasting, dry roasting, sautéing, boiling and steaming.
Some popular Indonesian dishes such as &quot;nasi goreng&quot;, &quot;gado-gado&quot;, satay, and &quot;soto&quot; are in the country and are considered national dishes. The official national dish of Indonesia is &quot;tumpeng&quot;, chosen in 2014 by Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy as the dish that binds the diversity of Indonesia&#x27;s various culinary traditions. Later in 2018, the same ministry has chosen 5 national dish of Indonesia; they are &quot;soto, rendang, satay, nasi goreng&quot;, and &quot;gado-gado&quot;.

Today, some popular dishes that originated in Indonesia are now common to neighbouring countries, Malaysia and Singapore. Indonesian dishes such as satay, beef &quot;rendang&quot;, and &quot;sambal&quot; are favoured in Malaysia and Singapore. Soy-based dishes, such as variations of tofu and tempeh, are also very popular. Tempeh is regarded as a Javanese invention, a local adaptation of soy-based food fermentation and production. Another fermented food is &quot;oncom&quot;, similar in some ways to tempeh but using a variety of bases (not only soy), created by different fungi, and particularly popular in West Java.

==History==

Indonesian cuisine has a long history—although most of it is not well-documented, and relied heavily on local practice and oral traditions. A rare instance is demonstrated by Javanese cuisine that somewhat has quite a well-documented culinary tradition. The diversity ranges from ancient &quot;bakar batu&quot; or stone-grilled yams and boar practiced by Papuan tribes of eastern Indonesia, to sophisticated contemporary Indonesian fusion cuisine. The ethnic diversity of Indonesian archipelago provides an eclectic combination — mixing local Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, Minang, Malay and other native cuisine traditions, with centuries worth of foreign contacts with Indian traders, Chinese migrants and Dutch colonials.

Rice has been an essential staple for Indonesian society, as bas-reliefs of 9th century Borobudur and Prambanan describes rice farming in ancient Java. Ancient dishes were mentioned in many Javanese inscriptions and historians have succeeded in deciphering some of them. The inscriptions from Kingdom of Mataram era circa 8th to 10th century mentioned several ancient dishes, among others are &quot;hadaŋan haraŋ&quot; (minced water buffalo meat satay, similar with today Balinese &quot;sate lilit&quot;), &quot;hadaŋan madura&quot; (water buffalo meat simmered with sweet palm sugar), and &quot;dundu puyengan&quot; (eel seasoned with lemon basil). Also various &quot;haraŋ-haraŋ&quot; (grilled meats) either &quot;celeṅ/wök&quot; (pork), &quot;hadahan/kbo&quot; (water buffalo), &quot;kidaŋ/knas&quot; (deer) or &quot;wḍus&quot; (goat). Ancient beverages include &quot;nalaka rasa&quot; (sugarcane juice), &quot;jati wangi&quot; (jasmine beverage), and &quot;kinca&quot; (tamarind juice). Also various &quot;kuluban&quot; (boiled vegetables served in spices, similar with today &quot;urap&quot;) and &quot;phalamula&quot; (boiled yams and tubers served with liquid palm sugar). Other ancient vegetable dishes include &quot;rumwah-rumwah&quot; (&quot;lalap&quot;), &quot;dudutan&quot; (raw vegetables) and &quot;tetis&quot;.

The 9th century Old Javanese Kakawin Ramayana mentioned cooking technique as Trijata offered Sita some food (canto 17.101); scrumptious food of &quot;landuga tatla-tila&quot; (cooked with oil) and &quot;modakanda sagula&quot; (sugared delicacies).

Several foods were mentioned in several Javanese inscriptions dated from the 10th to 15th centuries. Some of this dishes are identified with present-day Javanese foods. Among others are &quot;pecel&quot;, &quot;pindang&quot;, &quot;rarawwan&quot; (rawon), &quot;rurujak&quot; (rujak), &quot;kurupuk&quot; (krupuk), sweets like &quot;wajik&quot; and &quot;dodol&quot;, also beverages like &quot;dawet&quot;.

In the 15th century Sundanese manuscript Sanghyang Siksa Kandang Karesian, it was mentioned the common Sundanese food flavours of that times which includes; &quot;lawana&quot; (salty), &quot;kaduka&quot; (hot and spicy), &quot;tritka&quot; (bitter), &quot;amba&quot; (sour), &quot;kasaya&quot; (savoury), and &quot;madura&quot; (sweet).

By the 13th to 15th century, coastal Indonesian polities began to absorb culinary influences from India and the Middle East, as evidence with the adoption of curry-like recipes in the region. This was especially affirmative in the coastal towns of Aceh, Minangkabau lands of West Sumatra, and Malay ports of Sumatra and Malay peninsula. Subsequently, those culinary traditions displayed typical Indian culinary influences, such as &quot;kare&quot; (curry), &quot;roti cane&quot; and &quot;gulai&quot;. This also went hand in hand with the adoption of Islamic faith, thus encouraged &quot;halal&quot; Muslim dietary law that omits pork. On the other hand, the indigenous inhabitant that resides inland—such as the Bataks and Dayaks, retains their older Austronesian culinary traditions, which incorporate bushmeat, pork and blood in their daily diet.
According to the 17th century account of Rijklof van Goens, the ambassador of the VOC for Sultan Agung&#x27;s Javanese Mataram court, the techniques of meat processing (sheep, goats, and buffalo) during celebration in Java, was by grilling and frying the seasoned meat. Unlike European, the Javanese primarily use coconut oil instead of butter.

Chinese immigrants has settled in Indonesian archipelago as early as Majapahit period circa 15th century CE, and accelerated during Dutch colonial period. The Chinese settlers introduced stir-frying technique that required the use of Chinese wok and small amount of cooking oil. They also introduced some new Chinese cuisine—including soy sauce, noodles and soybean processing technique to make tofu. Subsequently, soybean processing led to the possibly accidental discovery of &quot;tempeh&quot; (fermented soybean cake). The earliest known reference to tempeh appeared in 1815 in the Javanese manuscript of Serat Centhini.

The vigor of spice trade during the Age of Discovery has brought European traders to Indonesian shores. Subsequently, European colonialism was established in the 19th century Dutch East Indies. The influences of European cuisine—most notably the Portuguese and Dutch, has introduced European techniques, especially in bread-making, pastries, cookies and cake-baking.

Indonesian culinary tradition has been exposed to various influences. Regarding the method of food processing techniques, each region has developed a specificity that ultimately leads to localization of regional taste.

==Customs, serving and consumption==

Indonesian traditional meals usually consists of steamed rice as staple, surrounded by vegetables and soup and meat or fish side dishes. In a typical family meal, the family members gather around the table filled with steamed rice and several other dishes. Each dish is placed in a separate communal large plate or in bowls. Each of these dishes has its own serving spoons, used only to take parts of the dishes from the communal plate into one&#x27;s own personal plate. Each of the family members has their own personal plate that is first filled with steamed rice. Usually the oldest family member or the husband has the right to initiate the meal, followed by the rest of the family to help themselves with the dishes. Each of them take some portion of dishes from the communal plates into their own individual plates.

On their personal plate, the steamed rice will soon be surrounded by two, three or more dishes; vegetables and fish or meat, and maybe some fried dishes, &quot;sambal&quot; and &quot;krupuk&quot;. In Indonesian customs — unlike in Japanese counterpart — it is quite acceptable to be seen to mix the different flavoured dishes in a single personal plate during consumption. A practice commonly found in &quot;nasi campur&quot;, &quot;nasi Padang&quot;, or during a buffet. The soupy dish might be served in a separate small personal bowl. Today in contemporary Indonesian restaurants, the set menu is often offered. This has led to the personal serving practice, in a similar fashion to those of Japanese cuisine, with a personal plate on a tray, a rattan or bamboo container each with a separate small portion of dishes surrounding the rice. This can be found in the presentation of nasi Bali.
Indonesian meals are commonly eaten with the combination of a spoon in the right hand and fork in the left hand (to push the food onto the spoon). Unlike the European dining custom, knives are absent from the dining table, thus most of the ingredients such as vegetables and meat are already cut into bite-size pieces prior to cooking. Although, in many parts of the country, such as West Java, Gorontalo and West Sumatra, it is also common to eat with one&#x27;s bare hands.

In restaurants or households that commonly use bare hands to eat, such as seafood food stalls, traditional Sundanese and Minangkabau restaurants, or East Javanese &quot;pecel lele&quot; (fried catfish with &quot;sambal&quot;) and &quot;ayam goreng&quot; (fried chicken) food stalls, &quot;kobokan&quot; is usually served along with the food. &quot;Kobokan&quot; is a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent, this bowl of water is not intended for consumption, rather it is used to wash one&#x27;s hand before and after eating.

Eating with chopsticks is generally only found in food stalls or restaurants serving Indonesian adaptations of Chinese cuisine, such as &quot;bakmie&quot; or &quot;mie ayam&quot; (chicken noodle) with &quot;pangsit&quot; (wonton), &quot;mie goreng&quot; (fried noodles), and &quot;kwetiau goreng&quot; (fried flat rice noodles).

==Staples==

===Rice===

Rice is a staple for all classes in contemporary Indonesia, and it holds the central place in Indonesian culture: it shapes the landscape; is sold at markets; and is served in most meals both as a savoury and a sweet food. The importance of rice in Indonesian culture is demonstrated through the reverence of Dewi Sri, the rice goddess of ancient Java and Bali. Traditionally the agricultural cycles linked to rice cultivations were celebrated through rituals, such as &quot;Seren Taun&quot; rice harvest festival.

Rice is most often eaten as plain rice with just a few protein and vegetable dishes as side dishes. It is also served as &quot;nasi uduk&quot; (rice cooked in coconut milk), &quot;nasi kuning&quot; (rice cooked with coconut milk and turmeric), &quot;ketupat&quot; (rice steamed in woven packets of coconut fronds), &quot;lontong&quot; (rice steamed in banana leaves), &quot;intip&quot; or &quot;rengginang&quot; (rice crackers), desserts, &quot;vermicelli&quot;, &quot;noodles&quot;, &quot;arak beras&quot; (rice wine), and &quot;nasi goreng&quot; (fried rice). &quot;Nasi goreng&quot; is omnipresent in Indonesia and considered a national dish.
Rice was only incorporated into diets as either the technology to grow it, or the ability to buy it from elsewhere, was gained. Evidence of wild rice on the island of Sulawesi dates from 3000 BCE. Evidence for the earliest cultivation come from the eighth century stone inscriptions from the central island of Java, which shows that kings levied taxes in rice. The images of rice cultivation, rice barns, and pest mice infesting a ricefield is evident in Karmawibhanga bas-reliefs of Borobudur. Divisions of labour between men, women, and animals that are still in place in Indonesian rice cultivation, were carved into relief friezes on the ninth century Prambanan temples in Central Java: a water buffalo attached to a plough; women planting seedlings and pounding grain; and a man carrying sheaves of rice on each end of a pole across his shoulders (&quot;pikulan&quot;). In the sixteenth century, Europeans visiting the Indonesian islands saw rice as a new prestige food served to the aristocracy during ceremonies and feasts.

Rice production in Indonesian history is linked to the development of iron tools and the domestication of wild Asian water buffalo as water buffalo for cultivation of fields and manure for fertiliser. Rice production requires exposure to the sun. Once covered in dense forest, much of the Indonesian landscape has been gradually cleared for permanent fields and settlements as rice cultivation developed over the last fifteen hundred years.

===Wheat===

Wheat is not a native plant to Indonesia. Through imports and foreign influences — most notably Chinese and Dutch — Indonesians began to develop a taste for wheat-based foodstuff, especially Chinese noodles, Indian roti, and Dutch bread. Other than common steamed rice, the Chinese in Indonesia also considered noodles, bakpao and &quot;cakwe&quot; as staples. Yet in Indonesia, especially in Java and Sumatra, the rice culture was so prevalent that sometimes these wheat-based dishes, such as noodles are treated as side dishes and are consumed with rice, while others such as Chinese buns and &quot;cakwe&quot; are treated as snacks. The European, especially the Portuguese and the Dutch, introduced bread and various type of bakery and pastry. These European staples have now become alternatives for a quick breakfast.

The Indonesian wheat consumption reached a new height after the advent of Indonesian instant noodle industry back in the 1970s. Since then Indonesia has become one of the world&#x27;s major producers and consumers of instant noodles. Indonesia is the world&#x27;s second largest instant noodle market only after China, with demand reaching 12.54 billion servings in 2018, Today, instant noodles have become a staple in Indonesian households for quick hot meals. Certain brands such as Indomie have become household names.

===Other staples===
Other staple foods in Indonesia include a number of starchy tubers such as yam, sweet potato, potato, taro and cassava. Starchy fruit such as breadfruit and jackfruit and grains such as maize are eaten. A sago congee called &quot;papeda&quot; is a staple food especially in Maluku and Papua. Sago is often mixed with water and cooked as a simple pancake. Next to sago, people of eastern Indonesia consume wild tubers as staple food.

Many types of tubers such as &quot;talas&quot; (a type of taro but larger and more bland) and breadfruit are native to Indonesia, while others were introduced from elsewhere. Yam was introduced from Africa; while potato, sweet potato, cassava and maize were introduced from the Americas through Spanish influence and reached Java in the 17th century. Cassava is usually boiled, steamed, fried or processed as a popular snack &quot;kripik singkong&quot; (cassava crackers). Dried cassava, locally known as &quot;tiwul&quot;, is an alternate staple food in arid areas of Java such as Gunung Kidul and Wonogiri, while other roots and tubers are eaten especially in hard times. Maize is eaten in drier regions such as Madura and islands east of the Wallace Line, such as the Lesser Sunda Islands.

==Vegetables==

A number of leaf vegetables are widely used in Indonesian cuisine, such as &quot;kangkung&quot;, spinach, &quot;genjer&quot;, &quot;melinjo&quot;, papaya and cassava leaves. These are often sauteed with garlic. Spinach and corn are used in simple clear watery vegetable soup &quot;sayur bayam bening&quot; flavoured with &quot;temu kunci&quot;, garlic and shallot. Clear vegetable soup includes &quot;sayur oyong&quot;. Other vegetables like calabash, chayote, &quot;kelor&quot;, yardlong bean, eggplant, &quot;gambas&quot; and &quot;belustru&quot;, are cut and used in stir fries, curries and soups like &quot;sayur asem&quot;, &quot;sayur lodeh&quot; or &quot;laksa&quot;. &quot;Daun ubi tumbuk&quot; is pounded cassava leaves dish, commonly found in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi. &quot;Sayur sop&quot; is cabbage, cauliflower, potato, carrot, with macaroni spiced with black pepper, garlic and shallot in chicken or beef broth. The similar mixed vegetables are also stir fried as &quot;cap cai&quot;, a popular dish of the Chinese Indonesian cuisine. &quot;Tumis kangkung&quot; is a popular stir-fried water spinach dish.

Vegetables like winged bean, tomato, cucumber and the small variety of bitter melon are commonly eaten raw, like in &quot;lalab&quot;. The large bitter melon variety is usually boiled. &quot;Kecombrang&quot; and papaya flower buds are a common Indonesian vegetable. &quot;Urap&quot; is seasoned and spiced shredded coconut mixed together with vegetables, &quot;asinan betawi&quot; are preserved vegetables. &quot;Gado-gado&quot; and &quot;pecel&quot; are a salad of boiled vegetables dressed in a peanut-based spicy sauce, while &quot;karedok&quot; is its raw version.

===Vegetarianism in Indonesia===

Vegetarianism is well represented in Indonesia, as there is a wide selection of vegetarian dishes and meat substitutes that may be served. According to Euromonitor International survei conducted in 2018, Indonesia has the third-highest rate of vegetarianism growth.
Dishes such as &quot;gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, tauge goreng, pecel, urap, rujak&quot; and &quot;asinan&quot; are vegetarian dishes. However, dishes that use peanut sauce, such as &quot;gado-gado, karedok&quot; or &quot;ketoprak&quot;, might contain small amounts of shrimp paste, called &quot;terasi&quot;, for flavor. Shrimp paste is also often used to add flavour to spicy &quot;sambal&quot; chili paste served with &quot;lalap&quot;, assorted fresh vegetables. Fermented soy products, such as tempeh, &quot;tahu&quot; (tofu) and &quot;oncom&quot; are prevalent as meat substitutes and as a source of vegetable protein. In contemporary fusion cuisine, tempeh is used to replace meat patties and served as tempeh burgers.

Most Indonesians do not practice strict vegetarianism and may consume vegetables or vegetarian dishes for their taste, preference, economic and health reasons. Nevertheless, there are small numbers of Indonesian Buddhists that practice vegetarianism for religious reasons.

==Meat and fish==
The main animal protein sources in the Indonesian diet are mostly poultry and fish, while meats such as beef, water buffalo, goat and mutton are commonly found in the Indonesian marketplaces.

===Poultry===

The most common poultry consumed is chicken and duck to a lesser amount, pigeon, quail and wild swamp bird such as watercock are also consumed. Traditionally, Indonesians breed free-range chickens in the villages known as &quot;ayam kampung&quot; (village chicken). Compared to common domesticated chickens, these village chickens are thinner and their meat are slightly firmer. Various recipes of &quot;ayam goreng&quot; (fried chicken) and &quot;ayam bakar&quot; (grilled chicken) are commonly found throughout Indonesia. Other than frying or grilling, chicken might be cooked as soup, such as &quot;sup ayam&quot; and &quot;soto ayam&quot;, or cooked in coconut milk as &quot;opor ayam&quot;. Chicken satay is also commonly found in Indonesia; it is barbecued on skewers and served with peanut sauce. Popular chicken recipes include &quot;ayam goreng kalasan&quot; from Yogyakarta, &quot;ayam bakar padang&quot; from Padang, &quot;ayam taliwang&quot; from Lombok, &quot;ayam betutu&quot; from Bali, and &quot;ayam goreng lengkuas&quot; (galangal fried chicken).

===Meat===

Beef and goat meat are the most commonly consumed meats in Indonesia, while &quot;kerbau&quot; (water buffalo) and domestic sheep are also consumed to a lesser degree, since water buffalo are more useful for ploughing the rice paddies, while sheep are kept for their wool or to be used for the traditional entertainment of ram fighting. As a country with an Islamic majority, Indonesian Muslims follow the Islamic halal dietary law which forbids the consumption of pork.

In other parts of Indonesia where there are significant numbers of non-Muslims, boar and pork are commonly consumed. Dishes made of non-halal meats can be found in provinces such as Bali, North Sumatra, North Sulawesi, East Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, West Papua, Papua, and also in the Chinatowns of major Indonesian cities. Today to cater for the larger Muslim market, most of the restaurants and eating establishments in Indonesia put halal signs that signify that they serve neither pork nor any non-halal meats, nor do they use lard in their cooking. With an overwhelming Muslim population and a relatively small population of cattle, today Indonesians rely heavily on imported beef from Australia, New Zealand and the United States which often results in a scarcity and raised prices of beef in the Indonesian market.

The meat can be cooked in rich spices and coconut milk such as beef, goat or lamb &quot;rendang&quot;, skewered, seasoned and grilled chicken or mutton as satay, barbecued meats, or sliced and cooked in rich broth soup as &quot;soto&quot;. Muttons and various offals can be use as ingredients for soto soup or &quot;gulai&quot; curry. In Bali, with its Hindu majority, the &quot;babi guling&quot; (pig roast) is popular among locals as well as non-Muslim visitors, while the Batak people of North Sumatra have &quot;babi panggang&quot; that is a similar dish. Wild boar are also commonly consumed in Papua. The meat also can be processed to be thinly-sliced and dried as dendeng (jerky), or made into abon (meat floss). &quot;Dendeng celeng&quot; is Indonesian &quot;dried, jerked&quot; boar meat. Raised rabbits are also consumed as food in mountainous region of Indonesia.

Some game meat such as venison might be sold and consumed in some areas of Indonesia. In Kalimantan, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, and Papua, deer meat can be found, usually wildly acquired by hunting. Other unusual and often controversial exotic meats include frog legs and softshell turtle consumed in Chinese Indonesian and Javanese cuisine, horse meat consumed in Yogyakarta, West Nusa Tenggara, and South Sulawesi, turtle meat consumed in Bali and Eastern Indonesia, snake, &quot;biawak&quot; (monitor lizard), &quot;paniki&quot; (fruit bats), dog meat, cat meat, and field rats consumed in Minahasan cuisine of North Sulawesi. Batak cuisine of North Sumatra is also familiar with cooking dog meat, while its consumption is diminishing in Central Java. Exotic and rare game meat such as crocodile, squirrel, civet, and monkey might also be sold and consumed in wilder parts of Indonesia.

===Fish===

In an archipelagic nation, seafood is abundant, and it is commonly consumed especially by Indonesian residents in coastal areas. Fish is especially popular in the eastern Indonesian regions of Sulawesi and Maluku, where most of the people work as fishermen. Both areas have a vast sea which brings them many different kinds of seafood.

Popular seafood in Indonesian cuisine includes skipjack tuna, tuna, mackerel, pomfret, wahoo, milkfish, trevally, rabbitfish, abalistes, amberjacks, rastrelliger, yellowtail scad, nemipterus japonicus, john dory, garoupa, red snapper, anchovy, swordfish, shark, stingray, squid or cuttlefish, shrimp, crab, blue crab, and mussel.

Seafood is commonly consumed across Indonesia, but it is especially popular in Maluku islands, Gorontalo Peninsula and Minahasa (North Sulawesi) cuisine. Seafood is usually grilled, boiled or fried. &quot;Ikan bakar&quot; is a popular grilled fish dish that can be found throughout Indonesia. The method of cooking like stir fried in spices or in soup is also possible. Salted fish is preserved seafood through cured in salt, it also can be found in Indonesian market.

Fresh water fisheries can be found in inland regions or in areas with large rivers or lakes. Fresh water fishes are popular in Sundanese cuisine of West Java, caught or raised in Lake Toba in Batak lands of North Sumatra, or taken from large rivers in Malay lands of Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra, or large rivers in Kalimantan. Popular fresh water fish among others; carp, gourami, catfish, &quot;pangasius&quot;, snakehead, &quot;trichogaster&quot;, climbing gourami, Nile tilapia, and Mozambique tilapia.

===Insects===
Unlike Thailand, in Indonesia insect is not a popular food ingredient nor widely available as street food. In Java, locals do catch, breed and sell certain species of insects, usually sold fresh or alive as pet bird feed. Nevertheless, traditionally several cultures in Indonesia are known to consume insects, especially grasshopper, cricket, termite, also the larvae of sago palm weevil, bee and dragonfly. In Java and Kalimantan, grasshoppers and crickets are usually lightly battered and deep fried in palm oil as crispy &quot;kripik&quot; snack. Smaller grasshoppers, crickets and termites might be made as &quot;rempeyek&quot; batter cracker which resembles insect fossil. During monsoon rainy season, flying termites are abundant being attracted to lightbulbs to mate. Locals usually put a bucket of water under the lamp to trap the flying termites, pluck the wings, and roast the termites as additional protein-rich snack. In Banyuwangi, East Java, there is a specialty dish called &quot;botok tawon&quot; (honeybee botok), which is beehives that contains bee larvae, being seasoned in shredded coconut and spices, wrapped inside banana leaf package and steamed. Dayak tribes of Kalimantan, also Moluccans and Papuan tribes in Eastern Indonesia, are known to consumes &quot;ulat sagu&quot; (lit. sagoo caterpillar) or larvae of sago palm weevil. This protein-rich larvae are considered a delicacy in Papua, and often being roasted prior of consumption. Locals may also commonly eat the larvae raw or alive. In Bali, dragonflies are also consumed by processing them into pepes.

==Spices and other flavourings==

&quot;Rempah&quot; is the Indonesian word for spice, while &quot;bumbu&quot; is the Indonesian word for a spice mixture or seasoning, and it commonly appears in the names of certain spice mixtures, sauces and seasoning pastes.

Known throughout the world as the &quot;Spice Islands&quot;, the Indonesian islands of Maluku contributed to the introduction of its native spices to world cuisine. Spices such as nutmeg or mace, clove, pandan leaves, &quot;keluwak&quot; and galangal are native to Indonesia. It is likely that black pepper, turmeric, lemongrass, shallot, cinnamon, candlenut, coriander and tamarind were introduced from India, while ginger, scallions and garlic were introduced from China. Those spices from mainland Asia were introduced early, in ancient times, thus they became integral ingredients in Indonesian cuisine.

In ancient times, the kingdom of Sunda and the later sultanate of Banten were well known as the world&#x27;s major producers of black pepper. The maritime empires of Srivijaya and Majapahit also benefited from the lucrative spice trade between the spice islands with China and India. Later the Dutch East India Company controlled the spice trade between Indonesia and the world.

===Sambal===
The Indonesian fondness for hot and spicy food was enriched when the Spanish introduced chili pepper from the New World to the region in the 16th century. After that hot and spicy &quot;sambals&quot; have become an important part of Indonesian cuisine.

Indonesia has perhaps the richest variants of sambals. In the Indonesian archipelago, there are as many as 300 varieties of &quot;sambal&quot;. The intensity ranges from mild to very hot. Sambal evolved into many variants across Indonesia, ones of the most popular is &quot;sambal terasi&quot; (&quot;sambal belacan&quot;) and &quot;sambal mangga muda&quot; (unripe mango sambal). &quot;Sambal terasi&quot; is a combination of chilies, sharp fermented shrimp paste called terasi, tangy lime juice, sugar and salt all pounded up with mortar and pestle. Dabu-dabu is a combined Gorontalo and North Sulawesi style of sambal with chopped fresh tomato, chili, and lime juice.

Sambal, especially sambal ulek, or sambal terasi can also become a base ingredient for many dishes, such as sambal raja (a dish from Kutai), terong balado, dendeng balado, ayam bumbu rujak, sambal goreng ati, among other things.

===Sauces and seasonings===
Soy sauce is also an important flavourings in Indonesian cuisine. &quot;Kecap asin&quot; (salty or common soy sauce) was adopted from Chinese cuisine, however Indonesian developed their own &quot;kecap manis&quot; (sweet soy sauce) with generous addition of palm sugar into soy sauce. Sweet soy sauce is an important marinade for barbecued meat and fish, such as satay and grilled fishes. Sweet soy sauce is also an important ingredient for &quot;semur&quot;, Indonesian stew.

===Peanut sauce===
One of the main characteristics of Indonesian cuisine is the wide application of peanuts in many Indonesian signature dishes, such as &quot;satay&quot;, &quot;gado-gado&quot;, &quot;karedok&quot;, &quot;ketoprak&quot;, and &quot;pecel&quot;. All of these dishes applied ample of &quot;bumbu kacang&quot; (peanut sauce) for flavouring. &quot;Gado-gado&quot; and &quot;satay&quot;, for example, have been considered Indonesian national dishes.

Introduced from Mexico by Portuguese and Spanish merchants in the 16th century, peanuts assumed a place within Indonesian cuisine as a key ingredient. Peanuts thrived in the tropical environment of Southeast Asia, and today they can be found, roasted and chopped finely, in many recipes. Whole, halved, or crushed peanuts are used to garnish a variety of dishes, and used in marinades and dipping sauces such as &quot;sambal kacang&quot; (a mixture of ground chilies and fried peanuts) for &quot;otak-otak&quot; or &quot;ketan&quot;. Peanut oil, extracted from peanuts, is one of the most commonly used cooking oils in Indonesia.

&quot;Bumbu kacang&quot; or peanut sauce represents a sophisticated, earthy seasoning rather than a sweet, gloppy sauce. It should have a delicate balance of savoury, sweet, sour, and spicy flavours, acquired from various ingredients, such as fried peanuts, &quot;gula jawa&quot; (coconut sugar), garlic, shallots, ginger, tamarind, lemon juice, lemongrass, salt, chilli, peppercorns, sweet soy sauce, ground together and mixed with water to form the right consistency. The secret to good peanut sauce is &quot;not too thick and not too watery&quot;. Indonesian peanut sauce tends to be less sweet than the Thai version, which is a hybrid adaptation. &quot;Gado-gado&quot; is a popular dish particularly associated with &quot;bumbu kacang&quot;, and is eaten across Indonesia.

===Coconut milk===


Coconuts are abundant in tropical Indonesia, and since ancient times Indonesians developed many and various uses for this plant. The broad use of coconut milk in dishes throughout the archipelago is another common characteristic of Indonesian cuisine. It is used in recipes ranging from savoury dishes – such as &quot;rendang&quot;, &quot;soto&quot;, &quot;gulai&quot;, &quot;mie koclok&quot;, &quot;sayur lodeh&quot;, &quot;gudeg&quot;, and &quot;opor ayam&quot; – to desserts – such as &quot;es cendol&quot; and &quot;es doger&quot;.

The use of coconut milk is not exclusive to Indonesian cuisine. It can also be found in Indian, Samoan, Thai, Malaysian, Filipino, and Brazilian cuisines. Nonetheless, the use of coconut milk is quite extensive in Indonesia, especially in Minangkabau cuisine and Gorontalese cuisine, although in Minahasan (North Sulawesi) cuisine, coconut milk is generally absent, except in Minahasan cakes and desserts such as &quot;klappertaart&quot;.

In Indonesian cuisine, two types of coconut milk are found, thin coconut milk and thick coconut milk. The difference depends on the water and oil content. Thin coconut milk is usually used for soups such as &quot;sayur lodeh&quot; and &quot;soto&quot;, while the thicker variety is used for &quot;rendang&quot; and desserts. It can be made from freshly shredded coconut meat in traditional markets, or can be found processed in cartons at the supermarket.

After the milk has been extracted from the shredded coconut flesh to make coconut milk, the &quot;ampas kelapa&quot; (leftover coconut flesh) can still be used in &quot;urap&quot;, seasoned and spiced shredded coconut meat mixed together with vegetables. Leftover shredded coconut can also be cooked, sauteed and seasoned to make &quot;serundeng&quot;, almost powdery sweet and spicy finely shredded coconut. Kerisik paste, added to thicken rendang, is another use of coconut flesh. To acquire a rich taste, some households insist on using freshly shredded coconut, instead of leftover, for &quot;urap&quot; and &quot;serundeng&quot;. &quot;Serundeng&quot; can be mixed with meat in dishes such as &quot;serundeng daging&quot; (beef serundeng) or sprinkled on top of other dishes such as &quot;soto&quot; or &quot;ketan&quot; (sticky rice). An example of the heavy use of coconut is &quot;burasa&quot; from Makassar, rice wrapped in banana leaf cooked with coconut milk and sprinkled with powdered coconut similar to &quot;serundeng&quot;.

==Cooking method==
Most of the common Indonesian dishes are named according to their main ingredients and cooking method. For example, &quot;ayam goreng&quot; is &quot;ayam&quot; (chicken) and &quot;goreng&quot; (frying), which denotes fried chicken. &quot;Mie goreng&quot; is fried noodle, &quot;ikan bakar&quot; is grilled fish, &quot;udang rebus&quot; is boiled shrimp, &quot;babi panggang&quot; is roasted pork and &quot;tumis kangkung&quot; is stir fried water spinach. Cooking methods in Indonesian kitchen are &quot;goreng&quot; (frying) either in a small amount of oil or deep frying with a lot of cooking oil, &quot;tumis&quot; (stir frying), &quot;sangrai&quot; (sautéing). Roasting methods are &quot;bakar&quot; (grilling) usually employing charcoal, firewood, or coconut shell, &quot;panggang&quot; (baking/roasting) usually refer to baking employing oven. Other methods are &quot;rebus&quot; (boiling), &quot;kukus&quot; (steaming) and &quot;asap&quot;/&quot;salai&quot; (smoking).

The fire used in cooking can be either a strong fire or a small fire for slow cooking. Cooking &quot;nasi goreng&quot; usually employs strong fire, while authentic &quot;rendang&quot; for example requires a small fire for slow cooking of beef, spices, and coconut milk until the meat is caramelised and all the coconut milk&#x27;s liquid has evaporated. Traditional Indonesian &quot;dapur&quot; (kitchen) usually employs firewood-fuelled kitchen stove, while the contemporary household today uses liquefied petroleum gas-fuelled stove or an electric stove. The ingredients could be cut into pieces, sliced thinly, or ground into a paste. Cooking utensils are &quot;wajan&quot; (wok), &quot;penggorengan&quot; (frying pan), &quot;panci&quot; (cauldron), knives, several types of spoon and fork, &quot;parutan&quot; (shredder), &quot;cobek&quot; and &quot;ulekan&quot; (stone mortar and pestle). Traditionally Indonesians use a stone mortar and a pestle to grind the spices and ingredients into coarse or fine pastes. Today most households use blender or food processor for the task. Traditional Indonesian cooking wares are usually made from stone, earthenware pottery, wood, and woven bamboo or a rattan container or filter, while contemporary cooking wares, plates and containers use metals – iron, tin, stainless steel, aluminium, ceramics, plastics, and also glass.

==National dishes==
Initially during the early years of Indonesian independence, the ubiquitous and highly popular &quot;nasi goreng&quot; was considered the national dish of the republic, albeit at that time was unofficial. Its simplicity and versatility has contributed to its popularity and made it as a staple among Indonesian households—colloquially considered the most &quot;democratic&quot; dish since the absence of an exact and rigid recipe has allowed people to do anything they want with it. 

&quot;Nasi goreng&quot; that is commonly consumed daily in Indonesian households was considered the quintessential dish that represent an Indonesian family. It is in the menu, introduced, offered and served in Indonesian Theatre Restaurant within the Indonesian pavilion at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Howard Palfrey Jones, the US ambassador to Indonesia during the last years of Sukarno&#x27;s reign in the mid 1960s, in his memoir &quot;Indonesia: The Possible Dream&quot;, said that he likes &quot;nasi goreng&quot;. He described his fondness for &quot;nasi goreng&quot; cooked by Hartini, one of Sukarno&#x27;s wives, and praised it as the most delicious &quot;nasi goreng&quot; he ever tasted. Nevertheless, other widely popular Indonesian dishes, such as satay, &quot;soto&quot; and &quot;gado-gado&quot; are also considered strong contenders. Soto is ubiquitous in Indonesia and considered one of Indonesia&#x27;s national dishes.

In 2014, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy in an effort to promote Indonesian cuisine, has chosen &quot;tumpeng&quot; as an official Indonesian national dish. Technically &quot;tumpeng&quot; refer to the rice cone in the center, while the surrounding various dishes might be taken from any choice of various Indonesian dishes—thus was considered ideal as a national dish that binds the diversity of Indonesia&#x27;s various culinary traditions. Subsequently the designation of &quot;tumpeng&quot; as the single national dish of Indonesia was considered insufficient to describe the diversity of Indonesian culinary traditions. Later in 2018, the same ministry has chosen another additional 5 national dishes of Indonesia; they are &quot;soto&quot;, satay, &quot;nasi goreng&quot;, &quot;rendang&quot; and &quot;gado-gado&quot;.

Satay and &quot;soto&quot; are notable and the natural choice to be promoted as Indonesian national dish, since they had transcends the cultural boundaries of myriad ethnic groups of Indonesia—those dishes has been extremely localised and has branched into various recipes nationwide. For example, there are rich variants of satay and &quot;soto&quot; recipes throughout Indonesia; from Sumatra to Eastern Indonesia. Each cultures, ethnics, or even cities had adopted these dishes, and thus developed their own version in accordance to their own culture, tradition, creativity, localised taste and preference, also the availability of local ingredients.

==Regional dishes==

===Jakarta===
Diverse and eclectic, Betawi cuisine of Jakarta draw culinary influences from Chinese, Malay, Sundanese, to Arab, Indian and European. Popular Betawi dishes include &quot;nasi uduk&quot; (coconut rice), &quot;sayur asem&quot; (sweet and sour vegetable soup), &quot;asinan&quot; (salad of pickled vegetables), &quot;gado-gado&quot;, (boiled or blanched vegetables salad in peanut sauce), &quot;ketoprak&quot;, (vegetables, tofu, rice vermicelli and rice cake in peanut sauce), and &quot;kerak telor&quot; (spiced coconut omelette). Born from a creole or hybrid phenomena, the Betawi cuisine is quite similar to the Peranakan cuisine.

===West Java===
A textural speciality of Sunda (West Java) is &quot;karedok&quot;, a fresh salad made with long beans, bean sprouts, and cucumber with a spicy peanut sauce. Lalab fresh vegetables served with spicy sambal dipping sauce is ubiquitous in Sundanese households and eating establishments. Other Sundanese dishes include &quot;mie kocok&quot; which is a beef and egg noodle soup, and &quot;Soto Bandung&quot;, a beef and vegetable soup with daikon and lemon grass. A hawker favourite is &quot;kupat tahu&quot; (pressed rice, bean sprouts, and tofu with soy and peanut sauce). &quot;Colenak&quot; (roasted fermented cassava tapai with sweet coconut sauce) and &quot;ulen&quot; (roasted brick of sticky rice with peanut sauce) are dishes usually eaten warm.

===Central Java===
The food of Central Java is renowned for its sweetness, and the dish of &quot;gudeg&quot;, a curry made from jackfruit, is a particularly sweet. The city of Yogyakarta is renowned for its &quot;ayam goreng&quot; (fried chicken) and &quot;klepon&quot; (green rice-flour balls with palm sugar filling). Surakarta&#x27;s (Solo) specialities include &quot;Nasi liwet&quot; (rice with coconut milk, unripe papaya, garlic and shallots, served with chicken or egg) and &quot;serabi&quot; (coconut milk pancakes topped with chocolate, banana or jackfruit). Other Central Javanese specialities &quot;pecel&quot; (peanut sauce with spinach and bean sprouts), &quot;lotek&quot; (peanut sauce with vegetable and pressed rice), and &quot;opor ayam&quot; (braised chicken in coconut sauce).

===East Java===

The food of East Java is similar to that of Central Java. East Java foods tend to be less sweet and more spicier compare to the Central Javanese ones. Fish and fish/seafood products are quite extensively, e.g. &quot;terasi&quot; (dried shrimp paste) and &quot;petis udang&quot; (shrimp paste). Some of the more popular foods are lontong kupang (tiny clams soup with rice cakes), &quot;lontong balap&quot; (bean sprouts and tofu with rice cakes), &quot;sate klopo&quot; (coconut beef satay), &quot;semanggi surabaya&quot; (marsilea leaves with spicy sweet potato sauce), &quot;pecel lele&quot; (deep fried catfish served with rice and sambal), &quot;rawon&quot; (dark beef soup). Food from Malang includes &quot;bakso malang&quot; (meatball soup with won ton and noodles) and &quot;&quot; (pressed rice, tempe, sprouts, soy sauce, coconut, and peanuts).&quot;

===Madura===
Madura is an island on the northeastern coast of Java and is administered as part of the East Java province. Like the Eastern Javanese foods which use &quot;petis udang&quot;, Madura foods add &quot;petis ikan&quot; which is made from fish instead of shrimp. The Madura style satay is probably the most popular satay variants in Indonesia. Some of its popular dishes are &quot;sate ayam Madura&quot; (chicken satay with peanut sauce), &quot;soto Madura&quot; (beef soup). There is also a mutton variant of Madura satay, Madura goat satay. &quot;Sup Kambing&quot; mutton soup is also popular in Madura. As a leading salt production center in Indonesian archipelago, Madura dishes are often saltier compared to other Eastern Javanese foods.

===Bali===
Balinese cuisine dishes include &quot;lawar&quot; (chopped coconut, garlic, chilli, with pork or chicken meat and blood). &quot;Bebek betutu&quot; is duck stuffed with spices, wrapped in banana leaves and coconut husks cooked in a pit of embers.

Another batak dish, &quot;ayam namargota&quot;, is chicken cooked in spices and blood. Another notable Batak dish is &quot;arsik&quot;, the carp fish cooked with spices and herbs. &quot;Lada rimba&quot; is strong pepper used by Bataks.

=== Aceh ===

Arab, Persian, and Indian traders influenced food in Aceh although flavours have changed a lot their original forms. Amongst these are curry dishes known as &quot;kare&quot; or &quot;gulai&quot;, which are rich, coconut-based dishes traditionally made with beef, goat, fish or poultry, but are now also made with tofu, vegetables, and jackfruit. The popular Aceh food such as &quot;roti cane&quot;, &quot;mie aceh&quot; and &quot;nasi gurih&quot;.

===West Sumatra===

Buffaloes are a symbol of West Sumatra and are used in &quot;rendang&quot;, a rich and spicy buffalo meat or beef dish, which is also the signature dish of Minangkabau culture. In 2017, rendang was chosen as the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Delicious Food&quot; by the CNN Travel reader&#x27;s choice. Padang food comes from West Sumatra, and they have perhaps the richest variants of &quot;gulai&quot;, a type of curried meat, offal, fish or vegetables. Padang favourite includes &quot;asam padeh&quot; (sour and spicy fish stew), &quot;sate Padang&quot; (Padang satay), &quot;soto Padang&quot; (Padang soto) and &quot;katupek sayua&quot; (ketupat rice dumpling in vegetable soup). Dishes from the region include &quot;nasi kapau&quot; from Bukittinggi, which is similar to Padang food but uses more vegetables. &quot;Ampiang dadiah&quot; (buffalo yogurt with palm sugar syrup, coconut flesh and rice) and &quot;bubur kampiun&quot; (Mung bean porridge with banana and rice yogurt) are other West Sumatran specialties.

Traditionally, Minangkabau people adheres to &quot;merantau&quot; (migrating) culture, and they are avid restaurant entrepreneurs. As a result, Padang food restaurant chains can be found throughout Indonesia and neighbouring countries, likely making it the most popular regional dish in Indonesia. Outside of West Sumatra, such as in Java, most Padang Restaurants still use buffalo to make rendang, but claim it is Rendang Sapi for selling purposes, due to buffalo meat being &quot;inferior&quot; and cheaper than cow meat. Buffalo meat is harder, so it is more suitable for rendang which has a cooking time of at least 3 hours, and presents a coarser texture and a redder color compared to cow meat when it is fully cooked.

===East Sumatra===
The cuisine of east coast of Sumatra is referring to the culinary tradition of ethnic Malays of Indonesian Sumatran provinces facing Malacca strait; which includes Riau, Riau Islands, Jambi provinces and coastal North Sumatra in Melayu Deli areas in and around Medan. Because of close ethnic kinship and proximity to Malaysian Malays, many dishes are shared between the two countries. For example &quot;nasi lemak&quot;, the national dish of Malaysia, and also &quot;nasi ulam&quot; are considered native dishes in Riau and Jambi. Malay cuisine also shares many similarities with neighboring Minangkabau cuisine of West Sumatra, South Sumatra, and also Aceh; such as sharing &quot;gulai&quot;, &quot;asam pedas&quot;, &quot;pindang&quot;, &quot;kari&quot;, &quot;lemang&quot; and &quot;rendang&quot;. This is due to the fact that the Minangkabau are culturally closely related to the Malays. &quot;Tempoyak&quot; fermented durian sauce and &quot;sambal belacan&quot; are the familiar condiments in both Sumatra and Malay Peninsula. Variants of peranakan cuisine such as &quot;laksa&quot; spicy noodle and &quot;otak-otak&quot; are also can be found in Riau Islands and Medan. Seafood dishes are popular in archipelagic Riau Islands province, while fresh water fishes from Sumatran rivers, such as &quot;patin&quot;, catfish, carp and gourami are popular in Riau and Jambi. &quot;Gulai ikan patin&quot; is a signature dish of Pekanbaru, while &quot;gulai ketam&quot; (crab gulai) and &quot;nasi goreng teri Medan&quot; (Medan anchovy fried rice) are the signature dishes of Medan.

===South Sumatra===
The city of Palembang is the culinary centre of South Sumatra and is renowned for its &quot;pempek&quot;, a deep fried fish and sago dumpling that is also known as &quot;empek-empek&quot;. &quot;Pempek&quot; is served in distinctive &quot;kuah cuko&quot;, a sweet, sour and spicy sauce made from palm sugar, chili, tamarind and vinegar. &quot;Pempek&quot; derivatives dishes are &quot;tekwan&quot; soup of &quot;pempek&quot; dumpling, mushroom, vegetables, and shrimp, &quot;lenggang&quot; or &quot;pempek&quot; slices in omelette. &quot;Mie celor&quot; is a noodle dish with egg in coconut milk and dried shrimp, it is a Palembang speciality.

The cuisine of Palembang demonstrates various influences, from native Palembang Malay taste to Chinese and Javanese influences. &quot;Pempek&quot; is said to be influenced by Chinese fish cake akin to &quot;surimi&quot;, while the preference of mild sweetness is said to be of Javanese influence. South Sumatra is home to &quot;pindang&quot;, a sweet, sour and spicy fish soup made from soy sauce and tamarind. &quot;Pindang&quot; dishes usually uses either freshwater fishes and seafood as ingredients. &quot;Ikan brengkes&quot; is fish in a spicy durian-based sauce. &quot;Tempoyak&quot; is a sauce of shrimp paste, lime juice, chilli and fermented durian, and &quot;sambal buah&quot; is a chilli sauce made from fruit.

=== Gorontalo ===
The strategic location of Gorontalo, between the Celebes Sea and Pacific Ocean in the north, and also Gulf of Tomini in the south, has made the Gorontalo region a strategic shipping route in the past. This long past history has formed the roots of a unique and distinctive culture in Gorontalo, including its unique dishes.

===South Sulawesi===
Makassar is one of the culinary centres in Indonesia. Home of some Bugis and Makassar delicacies such as &quot;Coto&quot;, &quot;Konro&quot;, &quot;Pallubasa&quot; and &quot;Mie Kering&quot;. All of these Makassar foods are usually consumed with burasa, a coconut milk rice dumpling wrapped in a banana leaf, to replace steamed rice or ketupat. As a big fish market centre, Makassar is also famous for its seafood. Various &quot;ikan bakar&quot; or grilled fish are popular and commonly served in Makassar restaurants, &quot;warung&quot; and foodstalls, such as &quot;ikan bolu bakar&quot; (grilled milkfish). &quot;Sop saudara&quot; from Pangkep and &quot;Kapurung&quot; from Palopo are also famous dishes of South Sulawesi. Another popular cuisine from Makassar is &quot;Ayam Goreng Sulawesi&quot; (Celebes fried chicken); the chicken is marinated in a traditional soy sauce for up to 24 hours before being fried into a golden colour.

===Nusa Tenggara===

With a drier climate in Nusa Tenggara archipelago, there is less rice and more sago, corn, cassava, and taro compared to central and western Indonesia. Fishes are popularly consumed, including &quot;sepat&quot; (Trichogaster), which is shredded fish in coconut and young-mango sauce. Lombok&#x27;s sasak people enjoy spicy food such as &quot;ayam taliwang&quot; which is roasted chicken served with peanut, tomato chilli and lime dip. &quot;Pelecing&quot; is a spicy sauce used in many dishes made with chilli, shrimp paste, and tomato.

==Foreign influences==
===Indian influences===
Indian influence can be observed in Indonesia as early as the 4th century. Following the spread of Islam to Indonesia, Muslim Indian as well as Arab influences made their way into Indonesian cuisine. Andreas Maryoto, a journalist which focus on culinary history, suggests there was at least two waves of Indian culinary influence that made its way into Indonesia. The early arrival was marked by the adoption of Hindu culture that still can be seen in Java. The second wave was came from the Mughal Empire, which was influenced by Islamic culture that has entered the archipelago. This second wave of Indian culinary influence can be seen throughout most of northern Sumatra, especially in Aceh and West Sumatra provinces. Examples include Indian &quot;martabak&quot; and &quot;kari&quot; (curry) that influenced Sumatran cuisines of Aceh, Minangkabau, and Malay; in addition to Betawi and coastal Javanese cuisine. Some of Aceh and Minangkabau dishes such as &quot;roti cane, nasi biryani, nasi kebuli&quot;, and &quot;gulai kambing&quot; can trace its origin to Indian influences.

===Arab influences===
Arab Indonesians brought their legacy of Arab cuisine—originally from Hadhramaut, Hejaz and Egypt—and modified some of the dishes with the addition of Indonesian ingredients. The Arabs arrived in the Nusantara archipelago to trade and spread Islam. &quot;Nasi kebuli&quot; for example, is a popular dish among Arab Indonesian community that has made its way into mainstream Indonesian cuisine. In Maluku, &quot;kue asida&quot; served during Ramadan for iftar, is believed to be derived from the Middle Eastern asida that was introduced by Arab merchants into the Maluku Islands.

===Chinese influences===

Chinese immigration to Indonesia started in the 7th century, and accelerated during Dutch colonial times, thus creating the fusion of Chinese cuisine with indigenous Indonesian style. Similar Chinese-native fusion cuisine phenomena is also observable in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore as peranakan cuisine. 

The Chinese cooking style that has influenced Indonesian cuisine was mainly Hokkien cuisine. Some of Chinese Indonesian food retain its Hokkien name; e.g. &quot;kwetiau, bakmi, bakcang, bihun&quot; and &quot;lumpia&quot;. Some popular Indonesian dishes trace its origin to Chinese influences such as; &quot;bakso, soto mie, soto, bakpau, nasi goreng, mie goreng, tahu goreng, siomay, pempek, nasi tim, cap cai, fu yung hai&quot; and &quot;swikee&quot;. Some of this Chinese-influenced dishes has been so well-integrated into Indonesian mainstream cuisine that many Indonesian today might not recognise their Chinese-origin and considered them their own.

===Dutch influences===

The Dutch arrived in Indonesia in the 16th century in search of spices. When the Dutch East India Company (VOC) went bankrupt in 1800, Indonesia became a treasured colony of the Netherlands. Through colonialism, Europeans introduced bread, cheese, barbecued steak and pancake. Bread, butter and margarine, chocolate sprinkles, sandwiches filled with ham, cheese or fruit jam, &quot;poffertjes, pannekoek&quot; and Dutch cheeses are commonly consumed by colonial Dutch and Indos during the colonial era. Some of native upperclass &quot;ningrat&quot; (nobles) and educated native were exposed to European cuisine; This cuisine was held in high esteem as the cuisine of the upper class of Dutch East Indies society.

This led to adoption and fusion of European cuisine into Indonesian cuisine. Several Indonesian food can trace its origin from Dutch influence, such as &quot;kue odading&quot; that was derived from Dutch &quot;oliebollen&quot;, &quot;semur&quot; from Dutch &quot;smoor&quot;, &quot;perkedel&quot; from &quot;frikadeller&quot;, &quot;sop senerek&quot; from &quot;erwtensoep&quot;, &quot;selat solo&quot; (solo salad) from &quot;holland biefstuk&quot;.
Some dishes created during the colonial era were influenced by Dutch cuisine, including &quot;roti bakar&quot; (grilled bread), &quot;roti buaya&quot;, &quot;macaroni schotel&quot; (macaroni casserole), &quot;pastel tutup&quot; (Shepherd&#x27;s pie), &quot;bistik jawa&quot; (Javanese beef steak), &quot;erten&quot; (pea soup), &quot;brenebon&quot; (kidney bean soup) and &quot;sop buntut&quot;.

Many pastries, cakes and cookies such as &quot;kue bolu&quot; (tart), &quot;lapis legit&quot; (&quot;spekkoek&quot;), &quot;lapis Surabaya&quot; (&quot;spiku&quot;), &quot;kroket&quot; (croquette), &quot;kue bolu kenari&quot; (&quot;ontbijtkoek&quot;), and &quot;kastengel&quot; (&quot;kaasstengels&quot; or cheese sticks) are come from Dutch influence. Some recipes were invented as Dutch Indies fusion cuisine, using native ingredients but employing European pastry techniques. These include pandan cake and &quot;klappertaart&quot; (coconut tart). &quot;Kue cubit&quot;, commonly sold as a snack at schools and marketplaces, are believed to be derived from &quot;poffertjes&quot;.

==Influence abroad==
Conversely, Indonesian cuisine also had influenced the Dutch through their shared colonial heritage. Indonesian cuisine also influencing neighbouring countries through Indonesians migration across the straits to Malaysia.

===Malaysia===
Because of their proximity, historic migrations and close cultural kinship, Indonesian cuisine also has influenced neighbouring cooking traditions; most notably Malaysian cuisine. Indonesian influence is pervasive in the central state of Negeri Sembilan, which was settled largely by Minangkabau people hailing from West Sumatra and is, thus, reflected in their culture, history and cuisine. Minangkabau cuisine influences is profound in Malay cooking tradition, as the result both traditions share same dishes; including &quot;rendang&quot;, &quot;gulai&quot;, &quot;asam pedas&quot; and &quot;tempoyak&quot;. Rendang is a typical example that has been well-integrated into mainstream Malaysian cuisine and is now considered their own, and popular especially during &quot;Hari Raya Aidil Fitri&quot;. In the early 20th century, there are large influx of Sumatrans to Kuala Lumpur and other parts of Malaysia heartland, that led to the popularity of &quot;Nasi Padang&quot; (originated from Padang city, West Sumatra) not only in Malaysia, but also in Singapore.

The Malay cuisine of southernmost state of Johor, reflects the influences of Javanese who settled there for over past two centuries. Popular Javanese-origin dishes in Johor includes &quot;ayam penyet&quot;, &quot;nasi ambeng&quot;, &quot;telur pindang&quot;, &quot;sayur lodeh&quot;, &quot;mee rebus&quot; and &quot;pechal&quot;.

===Singapore===

Some dishes in Singapore are influenced by Indonesian cuisine. Satay bee hoon has a connection to Javanese cuisine. The dish was a product of Teochew Chinese and Javanese culinary cultures. Singaporean rojak has its roots in Indonesia. In cakes and pastries, Indonesian traditional &quot;kue&quot; snacks and dessert also has influenced Singapore&#x27;s &quot;kueh&quot; scene, through the migration of Anastasia Liew, a Chinese Indonesian entrepreneur, into the city state and established Bengawan Solo cake shop that has become a Singaporean signature.

===Thailand===
To a lesser extent, Indonesian cuisine also had influenced Thai cuisine — probably through Malaysian intermediary — such as the introduction of satay, from Java to Sumatra, Malay Peninsula, and reached Thailand. &quot;Achat&quot; ( ), is a Thai pickles which believed to be derived from Indonesian &quot;acar&quot;. It is made with cucumber, red chilies, red onions or shallots, vinegar, sugar and salt. It is served as a side dish with the Thai version of satay ().

===Netherlands===
During the colonial period, the Dutch embraced Indonesian cuisine both at home and abroad. The Indonesian cuisine had influenced colonial Dutch and Indo people that brought Indonesian dishes back to the Netherlands due to repatriation following the independence of Indonesia.

C. Countess van Limburg Stirum writes in her book &quot;The Art of Dutch Cooking&quot; (1962): &quot;There exist countless Indonesian dishes, some of which take hours to prepare; but a few easy ones have become so popular that they can be regarded as &quot;national dishes&quot;&quot;. She then provides recipes for &quot;nasi goreng&quot; (fried rice), &quot;pisang goreng&quot; (battered, deep fried bananas), &quot;lumpia goreng&quot; (fried spring rolls), &quot;bami&quot; (fried noodles), &quot;satay&quot; (grilled skewered meat), &quot;satay&quot; sauce (peanut sauce), and &quot;sambal oelek&quot; (chilli paste).

Dutch-Indonesian fusion dishes also exist, of which the most well-known is the rijsttafel (&quot;rice table&quot;), which is an elaborate meal consisting of many (up to several dozens) small dishes (hence filling &quot;an entire table&quot;). While popular in the Netherlands, Rijsttafel is now rare in Indonesia itself. Today, there are many Indonesian restaurants in the Netherlands, especially in large cities like Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Rotterdam.

===Culinary diplomacy===

Indonesian cuisine traditionally enjoyed popularity in neighbouring countries; e.g. Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Australia, as well as nations that shares historical ties with Indonesia; such as the Netherlands, Suriname, East Timor and South Africa. It is also increasingly popular in Japan and Korea.

Learning from the success of other countries culinary diplomacy, especially those of Thailand, Korea and Japan, in 2021, the Indonesian government has launched the &quot;Indonesia Spice Up The World&quot; program, which is a form of coordinated gastrodiplomacy efforts. The programme was launched to promote Indonesian cuisine abroad, to assist Indonesian culinary industry; by helping the local spice products and processed food to find their ways into the global market, and also to assist Indonesian restaurants abroad.

The &quot;Indonesia Spice Up The World&quot; program involves government&#x27;s inter-ministerial institutions, Indonesian food industry, and also the public. The objective of the program is to boost the export value of Indonesian spices and herbs to US$2 billion, and increasing the presence of four thousand Indonesian restaurants abroad by 2024.

==Meal times==

Indonesians might consume snacks or varieties of small dishes throughout the day. If separate scheduled larger meal is observed, they usually consists of &quot;sarapan&quot; or &quot;makan pagi&quot; (breakfast), &quot;makan siang&quot; (lunch) is often the main meal of the day, followed by &quot;makan malam&quot; (dinner). Mealtime is typically a casual and solitary affair, and might be observed differently across region.

In western and central Indonesia, the main meal is usually cooked in the late morning, and consumed around midday. In many families there is no set meal time when all members are expected to attend. For this reason, most of the dishes are made so that they can remain edible even if left on the table at room temperature for many hours. The same dishes are then re-heated for the final meal in the evening. Most meals are built around a cone-shaped pile of long-grain, highly polished rice. A meal may include a soup, salad (or more commonly vegetables sautéed with garlic), and another main dish. Whatever the meal, it is accompanied by at least one, and often several, relishes called &quot;sambals&quot;. Especially for Javanese family, on the table, it is also common to always have chips, that can be &quot;kerupuk, rempeyek&quot;, or any other chips to accompany the meal.

In eastern Indonesia, such as on the islands of Papua and Timor, where the climate is often much drier, the meals can be centred around other sources of carbohydrates such as sago or root vegetables and starchy tubers. Being east of the Wallace line, the biogeographic realm, and hence the flora and fauna, are quite different from those of the islands to the west, and so the food stuffs are as well.

==Feasts==

===&quot;Tumpeng&quot;===
Many Indonesian traditional customs and ceremonies incorporate food and feast, one of the best examples is &quot;tumpeng&quot;. Originally from Java, tumpeng is a cone shaped mound of rice surrounded by an assortment of other dishes, officially chosen as Indonesian national dish in 2014. Traditionally featured in &quot;slametan&quot; ceremonies, the cone of rice is made by using bamboo leaves woven into a cone-shaped container. The rice itself can be plain white steamed rice, &quot;uduk&quot; (rice cooked with coconut milk), or yellow rice (rice coloured with &quot;kunyit&quot;, i.e., turmeric). After it is shaped, the rice cone is surrounded by assorted dishes, such as &quot;urap&quot; vegetables, fried chicken, &quot;semur&quot; (beef in sweet soy sauce), teri kacang (little dried fish fried with peanuts), fried prawns, &quot;telur pindang&quot; (marbleized boiled eggs), shredded omelette, &quot;tempe orek&quot; (sweet, dry fried &quot;tempeh&quot;), &quot;perkedel kentang&quot; (mashed potato fritters), &quot;perkedel jagung&quot; (corn fritters), &quot;sambal goreng ati&quot; (liver in chilli sauce), and many other dishes. Nasi tumpeng probably comes from an ancient Indonesian tradition that revers mountains as the abode of the ancestors and the gods. Rice cone is meant to symbolise the holy mountain. The feast served as some kind of thanksgiving for the abundance of harvest or any other blessings. Because of its festivities and celebratory value, even now tumpeng is sometimes used as an Indonesian counterpart to birthday cake.

===&quot;Nasi Padang&quot;===
Having Nasi Padang in festive &quot;hidang&quot; (serve) style provides opportunity to sample wide array of Padang food in a single setting. &quot;Nasi Padang&quot; (Padang-style rice) is the steamed rice served with various choices of pre-cooked dishes originated from Padang city, West Sumatra. It is a miniature banquet of meats, fish, vegetables, and spicy sambals eaten with plain white rice. It is the Minangkabau&#x27;s great contribution to Indonesian cuisine.

After the customers are seated, they do not have to order. The waiter with stacked plates upon their hands will immediately serves the dishes directly to the table. The table will quickly be set with dozens of small dishes filled with richly flavoured foods such as beef rendang, various gulais, curried fish, stewed greens, chili eggplant, curried beef liver, tripe, intestines, or foot tendons, fried beef lung, fried chicken, and of course, sambal. A dozen of dishes is a normal number, it could reach 14 dishes or more. &quot;Nasi Padang&quot; is an at-your-table, by-the-plate buffet. Customers take — and pay for — only what they have consumed from this array.

===&quot;Rijsttafel&quot;===
Another Indonesian feast, the Rijsttafel (from Dutch, meaning &#x27;rice table&#x27;), demonstrates both colonial opulence and the diversity of Indonesian cuisine at the same time. The classic style rijsttafel involved serving of up to 40 different dishes by 40 male waiters, bare foot but dressed in formal white uniforms with &quot;blangkon&quot; (traditional Javanese caps) on their heads and batik cloth around their waists. In contemporary Indonesian cuisine, it has been adapted into a western style &quot;prasmanan&quot; buffet.

===&quot;Prasmanan&quot;===

When attending the reception of an Indonesian traditional wedding party, office lunch-time meeting, a seminar or dinner gathering, one usually will find themselves queuing to Indonesian &quot;prasmanan&quot;; a long table filled with wide array of Indonesian dishes. A &quot;prasmanan&quot; is quite similar with rijsttafel but minus the ceremonial waiters and usually served fewer choices of dishes compared to its flamboyant colonial predecessor. It is an Indonesian buffet as it employs a long table with a wide range of dishes, both savoury and sweet, served on it. It can usually be found in wedding ceremonies or any other festivities. The layout for an Indonesian wedding ceremony buffet is usually: plates, eating utensils (spoon and fork), and paper napkins placed on one end, followed by rice (plain or fried), a series of Indonesian (and sometimes international) dishes, &quot;sambal&quot; and &quot;krupuk&quot; (shrimp crackers), and ending with glasses of water on the other end of the table.

==Beverages==
===Non-alcoholic beverages===

The most common and popular Indonesian drinks and beverages are &quot;teh&quot; (tea) and &quot;kopi&quot; (coffee). Indonesian households commonly serve &quot;teh manis&quot; (sweet tea) or &quot;kopi tubruk&quot; to guests. Since the colonial era of Netherlands East Indies, plantations, especially in Java, were major producers of coffee, tea and sugar. Since then hot and sweet coffee and tea beverages have been enjoyed by Indonesians. Jasmine tea is the most popular tea variety drunk in Indonesia, however recent health awareness promotions have made green tea a popular choice. Usually coffee and tea are served hot, but cold iced sweet tea is also frequently drunk. Kopi luwak is Indonesian exotic and expensive coffee beverage made from the beans of coffee berries which have been eaten by the Asian palm civet (&quot;Paradoxurus hermaphroditus&quot;) and other related civets. &quot;Teh botol&quot;, bottled sweet jasmine tea, is now quite popular and locally competes favourably with international bottled soda beverages such as Coca-Cola and Fanta. &quot;Kopi susu&quot; (coffee with sweetened condensed milk) is an Indonesian version of Café au lait. Es kelapa muda or young coconut ice is fresh drink which is made from chilled young coconut water, coconut flesh and syrup. It is among favourite beverage in Indonesia.

Fruit juices (&quot;jus&quot;) are very popular. Varieties include orange (&quot;jus jeruk&quot;), guava (&quot;jus jambu&quot;), mango (&quot;jus mangga&quot;), soursop (&quot;jus sirsak&quot;) and avocado (&quot;jus alpokat&quot;), the last of these being commonly served with condensed milk and chocolate syrup as a dessert-like treat. Durian can be made into ice cream called &quot;es durian&quot;.
Many popular drinks are based on ice (&quot;es&quot;) and can also be classified as desserts. Typical examples include young coconut (&quot;es kelapa muda&quot;), grass jelly (&quot;es cincau&quot;), cendol (&quot;es cendol&quot; or &quot;es dawet&quot;), avocado, jackfruit and coconut with shredded ice and condensed milk (&quot;es teler&quot;), mixed ice (&quot;es campur&quot;), kidney beans (&quot;es kacang merah&quot;), musk melon (&quot;es blewah&quot;), and seaweed (&quot;es rumput laut&quot;).

Hot sweet beverages can also be found, such as &quot;bajigur&quot; and &quot;bandrek&quot; which are particularly popular in West Java. Both are coconut milk or coconut sugar (&quot;gula jawa&quot;) based hot drinks, mixed with other spices. Sekoteng, a ginger based hot drink which includes peanuts, diced bread, and &quot;pacar cina&quot;, can be found in Jakarta and West Java. &quot;Wedang jahe&quot; (hot ginger drink) and &quot;wedang ronde&quot; (a hot drink with sweet potato balls) are particularly popular in Yogyakarta, Central Java, and East Java.

===Alcoholic beverages===
As a Muslim-majority country, Indonesian Muslims share Islamic dietary laws that prohibit alcoholic beverages. Since ancient times, local alcoholic beverages were developed in the archipelago. According to a Chinese source, people of ancient Java drank wine made from palm sap called &quot;tuak&quot; (palm wine). Today &quot;tuak&quot; continues to be popular in the Batak region, North Sumatra. A traditional Batak bar serving tuak is called &quot;lapo tuak&quot;. In Solo, Central Java, &quot;ciu&quot; (a local adaptation of Chinese wine) is known. Bottled &quot;brem bali&quot; (Balinese rice wine) is popular in Bali. In Nusa Tenggara and Maluku Islands the people also drink palm wine, locally known as &quot;sopi&quot;. In the Minahasa region of North Sulawesi, the people drink a highly alcoholic drink called &quot;Cap Tikus&quot;. Indonesians developed local brands of beer, such as Bintang Beer and Anker Beer.

==Eating establishment==
In Indonesia, dishes are served from a fine dining restaurant in five-star hotel, a simple restaurant downtown, humble street side warung under the tent, to street hawker peddling their &quot;gerobak&quot; (cart) or &quot;pikulan&quot; (carrying using rod).

===Restaurant and warung===
In Indonesia &quot;rumah makan&quot; means restaurant, while &quot;warung&quot; means small and humble shop. From these eating establishments, a warteg (&quot;warung Tegal&quot;) and &quot;rumah makan Padang&quot; are particularly notable for their ubiquitousness in Indonesian cities and towns.

A warteg or &quot;warung tegal&quot; is a more specific warung nasi, established by Javanese people from the town Tegal in Central Java. They sells favourite Javanese dishes and rice, the wide array of pre-cooked dishes are arranged in glass windowed cupboard. They are well known on selling modestly-priced meals, popular among working class such as low-skilled labours in the cities. While &quot;rumah makan Padang&quot; is a Padang restaurant, a smaller scale Padang eateries might be called &quot;warung Padang&quot;.

Most of Indonesian restaurants are based upon specific regional cuisine tradition. For example, rumah makan Padang are definitely Minangkabau cuisine. Sundanese &quot;saung&quot; restaurant or colloquially called as &quot;kuring&quot; restaurants are selling Sundanese dishes. This includes Bataks&#x27; &quot;lapo&quot;, Manado and Balinese restaurants. While other restaurants might specifically featuring their best specific dishes, for example Ayam goreng Mbok Berek, Bakmi Gajah Mada, Satay Senayan, Rawon Setan Surabaya, Pempek Pak Raden, etc.

===Street food===
Indonesian street food are usually cheap, offer a great variety of food of different tastes, and can be found on every corner of the city.
Street and street-side vendors are common, in addition to hawkers peddling their goods on bicycles or carts. These carts are known as &quot;pedagang kaki lima&quot;. These food hawkers on carts or bicycles might be travelling on streets, approaching potential buyers through residential areas whilst announcing their presence, or stationing themselves on a packed and busy street side, setting simple seating under a small tent and waiting for customers. Many of these have their own distinctive call, tune, or noise to announce their presence. For example, &quot;bakso&quot; sellers will hit the side of a soup bowl using a spoon, whereas &quot;nasi goreng&quot; sellers announce themselves by hitting their wok.

In most cities, it is common to see Chinese dishes such as bakpao (steamed buns with sweet and savoury fillings), &quot;bakmie&quot; (noodles), and &quot;bakso&quot; (meatballs) sold by street vendors and restaurants, often adapted to become Indonesian-Chinese cuisine. One common adaptation is that pork is rarely used since the majority of Indonesians are Muslims. Other popular Indonesian street food and snacks are &quot;siomay&quot; and &quot;batagor&quot; (abbreviated from &quot;bakso tahu goreng&quot;), &quot;pempek&quot; (deep fried fish cake), &quot;bubur ayam&quot; (chicken congee), &quot;bubur kacang hijau&quot; (mung beans porridge), satay, &quot;nasi goreng&quot; (English: fried rice), &quot;soto mie&quot; (soto noodle), &quot;mie ayam&quot; (chicken noodle) and &quot;mie goreng&quot; (fried noodle), &quot;taoge goreng&quot; (mung bean sprouts and noodle salad), &quot;asinan&quot; (preserved vegetables or fruits salad), &quot;laksa, kerak telor&quot; (spicy omelette), &quot;gorengan&quot; (Indonesian assorted fritters) and &quot;bakwan&quot; (fried dish of beansprouts and batter).

Indonesian street snacks include iced and sweet beverages, such as &quot;es&quot; &quot;cendol&quot; or &quot;es dawet&quot;, &quot;es teler&quot;, &quot;es cincau&quot;, &quot;es doger&quot;, &quot;es campur&quot;, &quot;es potong&quot;, and &quot;es puter&quot;. Indonesian cakes and cookies are often called &quot;jajanan pasar&quot; (market munchies).

==Snacks==
===Kue===
Indonesia has a rich collection of snacks called &quot;kue&quot; (cakes and pastry), both savoury and sweet. Traditional kue usually made from rice flour, coconut milk, coconut sugar and mostly steamed or fried instead of baked. Traditional kue are popularly known as &quot;kue basah&quot; (&quot;wet kue&quot;) that has a moist and soft texture because of rich coconut milk. The &quot;kue kering&quot; (dried kue) is local name for cookies.

Indonesia has rich variations of kue, both native-origin or foreign-influenced. Popular ones include &quot;Bika Ambon&quot;, &quot;kue pisang&quot;, &quot;kue cubit&quot;, &quot;klepon&quot;, &quot;onde-onde&quot;, &quot;nagasari&quot;, &quot;kue pandan&quot;, &quot;lupis&quot;, &quot;lemang&quot;, &quot;lemper&quot;, &quot;lontong&quot;, &quot;tahu isi&quot;, &quot;getuk&quot;, &quot;risoles&quot;, &quot;pastel&quot;, &quot;lumpia&quot;, &quot;bakpia&quot;, &quot;lapis legit&quot;, &quot;soes&quot;, &quot;poffertjes&quot; and &quot;bolu kukus&quot;.

===Traditional crackers===
Traditional crackers are called &quot;krupuk&quot;, made from bits of shrimp, fish, vegetables or nuts, which are usually consumed as a crunchy snack or to accompany main meals. These crispy snacks sometimes are added upon the main meal to provide crunchy texture; several Indonesian dishes such as gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, lontong sayur, nasi uduk, asinan and bubur ayam are known to require specific type of krupuk as toppings. There are wide variations of &quot;krupuk&quot; available across Indonesia. The most popular ones would be &quot;krupuk udang&quot; (prawn crackers) and &quot;krupuk kampung&quot; or &quot;krupuk putih&quot; (cassava crackers).

Other popular types include &quot;krupuk kulit&quot; (dried buffalo-skin crackers), &quot;emping melinjo&quot; (gnetum gnemon crackers), and &quot;kripik&quot; (chips or crisps), such as &quot;kripik pisang&quot; (banana chips) and &quot;keripik singkong&quot; (Cassava chips), &quot;rempeyek&quot;, is a flour-based cracker with brittle of peanuts, anchovies or shrimp bound by crispy flour cracker, &quot;rengginang&quot; or &quot;intip&quot; (Javanese) is rice cracker made from sun-dried and deep fried leftover rice.

==Fruits==
Indonesian markets abound with many types of tropical fruit. These are an important part of the Indonesian diet, either eaten freshly, or made into juices (such as &quot;jus alpukat&quot;), desserts (such as &quot;es buah&quot; and es teler), processed in savoury and spicy dishes like rujak, fried like &quot;pisang goreng&quot; (fried banana), cooked into cakes (such as &quot;kue pisang&quot; or &quot;bika ambon&quot;), sweetened and preserved such as &quot;sale pisang&quot; and &quot;manisan buah&quot;, or processed into kripik (crispy chips) as snacks like jackfruit or banana chips.
Many of these tropical fruits such as &quot;mangga&quot; (mango), &quot;manggis&quot; (mangosteen), &quot;rambutan&quot;, &quot;cempedak&quot;, &quot;nangka&quot; (jackfruit), &quot;durian&quot;, &quot;jambu air&quot;, &quot;duku&quot; (&quot;langsat&quot;), &quot;jeruk bali&quot; (pomelo), &quot;belimbing&quot; (carambola), &quot;kedondong&quot; and &quot;pisang&quot; (banana), are indigenous to Indonesian archipelago; while others have been imported from other tropical countries, although the origin of many of these fruits might be disputed. &quot;Klengkeng&quot; (longan) were introduced from India, &quot;semangka&quot; (watermelon) from Africa, &quot;kesemek&quot; from China, while &quot;alpukat&quot; (avocado), &quot;sawo&quot;, &quot;markisa&quot; (passionfruit), &quot;sirsak&quot; (soursop), &quot;nanas&quot; (pineapple), &quot;jambu biji&quot; (guava) and &quot;pepaya&quot; (papaya) were introduced from the Americas. Many of these tropical fruits are seasonally available, according to each species flowering and fruiting seasons. While certain fruits such as banana, watermelon, pineapple and papaya are available all year round.

Today, Indonesian markets is also enrichen with selections of home-grown non-tropical fruits that is not native to Indonesia. Strawberry, melon, apple, pear and dragonfruit are introduced and grown in cooler Indonesian highlands such as Malang in mountainous East Java, Puncak and Lembang near Bandung, to mimic their native subtropics habitat.

In the last few years, fruit chips have been more and more various. In the old times, banana and jackfruit chips were the most common, but now Indonesian fruit chips are also made from strawberry, apple, dragonfruit, pepino, watermelon, melon, more. Malang, a city in East Java, is the centre of fruit chip production aside from tempeh chips.

Banana and coconut are particularly important, not only to Indonesian cuisine, but also in other uses, such as timber, bedding, roofing, oil, plates and packaging. Banana leaf and &quot;janur&quot; (young coconut leaf) are particularly important for packaging and cooking process, employed to make pepes, lontong and ketupat.

==Health==
===Nutrition===

Much carbohydrate intake in Indonesian cuisine comes from rice, while in eastern parts of Indonesia, yam and sago are common. Indonesian protein intake comes from soy bean products that are processed into tofu and tempeh. Chicken eggs, poultry and meats are also consumed. Most of the fat intake comes from cooking oil (coconut oil) of fried dishes, coconut milk, peanuts, as well as meats and offals.

Some Indonesian fruit and vegetable dishes such as fruit rujak, gado-gado, karedok, pecel, lalab, capcay, tofu and tempeh are foods with low fat and high fibre. Tempeh, for example, is a vegetarian substitute for meat. Some dishes, especially &quot;gorengan&quot; (deep-fried fritters) and those dishes infused or caramelised with coconut milk, such as rendang and gulai, might taste succulent but are rich in saturated fat.

===Food safety===
The authentic traditional Indonesian home cooking is freshly made and consumed daily with minimal or no processed, canned or preserved foods, which means there is a minimal amount of preservatives and sodium. Most ingredients are bought fresh very early in the morning from local traditional markets, cooked around the late morning and consumed mainly for lunch. The leftovers are stored in the cupboard or on the table covered with &quot;tudung saji&quot; (weaved bamboo food cover to protect the food from insects or other animals), all in room temperature to be heated and consumed again for dinner. Traditionally, Indonesian dishes are rarely stored for long periods of time, thus most of these dishes are cooked and consumed in the same day. Some exceptions apply to dried, salted, and processed food. For example, dry rendang may still be safe to consume for several days. Modern refrigeration technology is available in most households.

===Hygiene===
While most of Indonesian grocery products and food served in mid to upperscale eating establishments maintain food hygiene standard ranges from good to acceptable — regulated and supervised by &quot;Badan Pengawasan Obat dan Makanan&quot; (Indonesian Food and Drug Administration) — some warung traditional foodstalls and street vendors might have poor hygiene. The tropical microbes also might contribute to food poisoning cases mostly gastroenteritis, especially among foreigners during their stay in Indonesia. It is advisable to drink bottled or boiled drinking water, or choose cooked hot food instead of uncooked room temperatured ones sold by street vendors.

<doc id="406364" wikidata="Q1052725" url="?curid=406364" title="Sir Kay">
<text>In Arthurian legend, Kay (, Middle Welsh Kei or Cei; ; French: &quot;Keu&quot;; Old French: &quot;Kès&quot; or &quot;Kex&quot;) is King Arthur&#x27;s foster brother and later seneschal, as well as one of the first Knights of the Round Table. In later literature he is known for his acid tongue and bullying, boorish behaviour, but in earlier accounts he was one of Arthur&#x27;s premier warriors. Along with Bedivere, with whom he is frequently associated, Kay is one of the earliest characters associated with Arthur. Kay&#x27;s father is called Ector in later literature, but the Welsh accounts name him as Cynyr Ceinfarfog.

==Cai in Welsh tradition==
Cai or Cei is one of the earliest characters to be associated with the Arthurian mythology, appearing in a number of early Welsh texts, including &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;, &quot;Geraint fab Erbin&quot;, &quot;Iarlles y Ffynnon&quot;, &quot;Peredur fab Efrawg&quot;, &quot;Breuddwyd Rhonabwy&quot;, &quot;Pa Gur&quot;, and the Welsh Triads. His father is given as Cynyr Ceinfarfog (Fork-Beard), his son as Garanwyn and his daughter as Kelemon.

Before Cai&#x27;s birth, Cynyr prophesied that his son&#x27;s heart would be eternally cold, that he would be exceptionally stubborn, and that no one would be able to brave fire or water like him. Cai is attributed with a number of further superhuman abilities, including the ability to go nine days and nine nights without the need to breathe or to sleep, the ability to grow as &quot;tall as the tallest tree in the forest if he pleased&quot; and the ability to radiate supernatural heat from his hands. Furthermore, it is impossible to cure a wound from Cai&#x27;s sword. Cai is killed by Gwyddawg fab (son of) Menestyr, who is in turn killed in vengeance by Arthur.

Robert Graves commented that the early description of Cei &quot;is close to the account given of the Sun-hero Cuchulain in his battle rage. But in the later Arthurian legends Cei has degenerated into a buffoon and Chief of Cooks&quot;—an aspect of the folklore process whereby old heroes must be downgraded (but not forgotten) in order to make room for new.

===&quot;Pa Gur yv y Porthaur&quot;===
One of the earliest direct reference to Cai can be found in the 10th-century poem &quot;Pa Gur&quot;, in which Arthur recounts the feats and achievements of his warriors so as to gain entrance to a fortress guarded by Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr, the titular porter. The poem concerns itself largely with Cai&#x27;s exploits:

===&quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot;===

Culhwch&#x27;s father, King Cilydd son of Celyddon, loses his wife Goleuddydd after a difficult childbirth. When he remarries, the young Culhwch rejects his stepmother&#x27;s attempt to pair him with his new stepsister. Offended, the new queen puts a curse on him so that he can marry no one besides the beautiful Olwen, daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden. Though he has never seen her, Culhwch becomes infatuated with her, but his father warns him that he will never find her without the aid of his famous cousin Arthur. The young man immediately sets off to seek his kinsman. He finds him at his court in Celliwig in Cornwall and asks for support and assistance. Cai is the first knight to volunteer to assist Culhwch in his quest, promising to stand by his side until Olwen is found. A further five knights join them in their mission. They travel onwards until they come across the &quot;fairest of the castles of the world&quot;, and meet Ysbaddaden&#x27;s shepherd brother, Custennin. They learn that the castle belongs to Ysbaddaden, that he stripped Custennin of his lands and murdered the shepherd&#x27;s twenty-three children out of cruelty. Custennin set up a meeting between Culhwch and Olwen, and the maiden agrees to lead Culhwch and his companions to Ysbadadden&#x27;s castle. Cai pledges to protect the twenty-fourth son, Goreu with his life. The knights attack the castle by stealth, killing the nine porters and the nine watchdogs, and enter the giant&#x27;s hall. Upon their arrival, Ysbaddaden attempts to kill Culhwch with a poison dart, but is outwitted and wounded, first by Bedwyr, then by the enchanter Menw, and finally by Culhwch himself. Eventually, Ysbaddaden relents, and agrees to give Culhwch his daughter on the condition that he completes a number of impossible tasks (&quot;anoethau&quot;), including hunting the Twrch Trwyth and recovering the exalted prisoner Mabon ap Modron.

Cai is a prominent character throughout the tale and is responsible for completing a number of the tasks; he kills Wrnach the Giant, rescues Mabon ap Modron from his watery prison and retrieves the hairs of Dillus the Bearded. However, when Arthur makes a satirical englyn about Cai, he grows angry and hostile towards the king, ultimately abandoning the quest and his companions. The narrative tells us that Cai would &quot;have nothing to do with Arthur from then on, not when the latter was waning in strength or when his men were being killed.&quot; As a result, he did not take part in the hunt for Twrch Trwyth.

===Other appearances===
In the &quot;Life of St. Cadoc&quot; (c. 1100) Bedwyr is alongside Arthur and Cai in dealing with King Gwynllyw of Gwynllwg&#x27;s abduction of St. Gwladys from her father&#x27;s court in Brycheiniog. Cai appears prominently in the early Welsh version of &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;, in which he assists the two lovers and is himself infatuated with a maiden named Golwg Hafddydd, and in the early dialogue poems relating to Melwas&#x27;s abduction of Gwenhwyfar. The context suggests that Cai is rescuing the queen from the otherworldly suitor, and may imply a romantic relationship between Cai and Gwenhwyfar.

The Welsh Triads name Cai as one of the &quot;Three Battle-Diademed Men of the Island of Britain&quot; alongside Drystan mab Tallwch and Hueil mab Caw. In the &quot;Triads of the Horses&quot;, his horse is named as Gwyneu gwddf hir (Gwyneu of the Long Neck). According to tradition, Cai is intimately associated with the old Roman fort of Caer Gai.

In the Welsh Romances (specifically &quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot; and &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;), Cai assumes the same boorish role he takes in the continental romances. However, manuscripts for these romances date to well after Chrétien de Troyes, meaning that Cai as he appears there may owe more to Chrétien&#x27;s version of the character than to the indigenous Welsh representation.

==Kay in chronicles and romances==
Kay and Bedivere both appear in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, and support Arthur in his defeat of the Giant of Mont Saint-Michel. Geoffrey makes Kay the count of Anjou and Arthur&#x27;s steward, an office which he holds in most later literature. In Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;, a son Gronosis is mentioned, who is versed in evil. By contrast, the Welsh attribute to him a son and daughter named Garanwyn and Celemon. Romance literature rarely deals with Kay&#x27;s love life, with one exception being Girart d&#x27;Amiens&#x27;s &quot;Escanor&quot;, which details his love for Andrivete of Northumbria, whom he must defend from her uncle&#x27;s political machinations before they can marry.

In the works of Chrétien, Kay assumes the characteristics with which he is most associated today: hot-headedness and fiery temper (retained from the Welsh literature), supplemented by his role as an incompetent braggart. Chrétien uses him as a scoffer and a troublemaker; a foil for heroic knights including Lancelot, Ywain, or Gawain. He mocks the chivalric courtesy of Sir Calogrenant in &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;, and he tricks Arthur into allowing him to try to save Guinevere from Maleagant in &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;, which ends in his humiliating defeat. In &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, Sir Kay grows angry with Perceval&#x27;s naïveté and slaps a maiden who says he will become a great knight; Perceval later avenges her by breaking Kay&#x27;s shoulder. Wolfram von Eschenbach, who tells a similar story in his &quot;Parzival&quot;, asks his audience not to judge Kay too harshly, as his sharp words actually serve to maintain courtly order: &quot;Though few may agree with me—Keie was a brave and loyal man ... The mighty Keie.&quot;

Kay is ubiquitous in Arthurian literature but he rarely serves as anything but a foil for other characters. Although he manipulates the king to get his way, his loyalty to Arthur is usually unquestioned. In the Vulgate Cycle, the Post-Vulgate and Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Kay&#x27;s father Ector adopts the infant Arthur after Merlin takes him away from his birth parents, Uther and Igraine. Ector raises the future king and Kay as brothers, but Arthur&#x27;s parentage is revealed when he draws the Sword in the Stone at a tournament in London. Arthur, serving as squire to the newly knighted Kay, is locked out of the house and cannot get to his brother&#x27;s sword, so he uses the Sword in the Stone to replace it. Kay shows his characteristic opportunism when he tries to claim it was in fact he that pulled the sword from the stone, not Arthur, making Kay the true King of the Britons, but he ultimately relents and admits it was Arthur. He becomes one of the first Knights of the Round Table, described as &quot;best worthy to be a knight of the Round Table of any&quot;, and serves his foster-brother throughout his life.

Scholars have pointed out that Kay&#x27;s scornful, overly boastful character never makes him a clown, a coward or a traitor, except in the Grail romance &quot;Perlesvaus&quot;, in which he murders Arthur&#x27;s son Loholt and joins up with the king&#x27;s enemies. This strange work is an anomaly, however, and Kay&#x27;s portrayal tends to range from merely cruel and malicious, as in the &quot;Roman de Yder&quot; or Hartmann von Aue&#x27;s &quot;Iwein&quot; to humorously derisive and even endearing, as in &quot;Durmart le Gallois&quot; and &quot;Escanor&quot;.

Despite his ubiquity, Kay&#x27;s death is not a frequent subject in the Arthurian canon. In Welsh literature, it is mentioned he was killed by Gwyddawg and avenged by Arthur. In Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, he is killed in the war against the Roman Emperor Lucius, while the Vulgate Cycle describes his death in France, also in battle against the Romans. According to Malory&#x27;s Book 5, Kay does not die in the war against Rome, but rather survives and later is part of a party sent to try and retrieve Excalibur&#x27;s sacred scabbard, prior to the Battle of Camlann. He is also among the few people who survives the battle of Camlann, although it is ambiguous as to how he does so; in later interpretations it is suggested that he never participated in that battle.

==Modern interpretations==
*Kay is a main character in the first three books of T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; and &quot;The Queen of Air and Darkness&quot;. His portrayal is based on Malory&#x27;s account of Arthur&#x27;s upbringing, but White adds a number of new elements to the story, including one in which the young Kay kills a dangerous griffin with the aid of Robin Hood and Maid Marian. White&#x27;s Kay is quick-witted and often mean, but always a loving foster brother to Arthur, whom he calls &quot;the Wart&quot;. 
**Kay appears in the 1963 Walt Disney Studios animated film adaptation of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, where he is voiced by actor Norman Alden. Though he is inept at jousting and sword fighting, Ector remains determined to groom him for knighthood and to possibly take the crown. Kay serves as a foil to Arthur, being self-centered, lazy, and outwardly boorish and bitter. Kay constantly bullies Arthur, and has a grudge against him, often trying to physically hurt him for his mistakes. However, when Arthur becomes king, Kay comes to respect Arthur as the king, as shown when he reluctantly bows down to Arthur at first, then does so sincerely, and also shows guilt for the way he treated him in the past.
*In the 1970s TV series &quot;Arthur of the Britons&quot;, Cei (in the TV series changed to Kai) was played by Michael Gothard. In this version of the legend, Arthur is a Celtic chieftain and Cai is a Saxon orphan, raised together as brothers by an adoptive father, Llud, among the Celts. He is portrayed as somewhat hot-headed and sometimes distracted by female company, but a fiercely capable warrior (sometimes favouring an axe-weapon) and Arthur&#x27;s most trusted and loyal friend.
*In Thomas Berger&#x27;s 1978 &quot;Arthur Rex: A Legendary Novel&quot;, Kay is a somewhat foppish, sharp-tongued gourmand. Relieved to be freed from his bucolic upbringing in Wales, he takes charge of the kitchens at Camelot and yearns to make it a more sophisticated court. Arthur good-naturedly complains that Sir Kay is always serving him rich foods, when the king would rather just have simple meals. Kay supplies occasional comic relief in the book, but ultimately fights and dies with honour in the last battle against Mordred&#x27;s host.
*Kay is the main character of Phyllis Ann Karr&#x27;s 1982 novel &quot;The Idylls of the Queen&quot;. Expanding on a scene from the classic tales in which a knight is poisoned at Guinevere&#x27;s feast and the queen is accused of the crime, Karr turns her story into a murder mystery with Kay as the detective attempting to discover the truth.
*A version of Sir Kay appears in the 1982-1985 DC Comics maxi-series &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;.
*In Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s 1983 &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, Kay (spelled Cai) is Arthur&#x27;s foster-brother. After a near fatal accident as a small child, Arthur is sent to live with Cai and his father, Ectorius. Cai and Arthur love each other very much, and after Arthur is crowned, he tells Cai, &quot;God strike me if I ever ask that you, brother, should call me [king].&quot; Cai is described as having a facial scar and a limp, two injuries that he received while protecting Arthur during a Saxon invasion. Cai is made Arthur&#x27;s knight and chamberlain, and he keeps Arthur&#x27;s castle for him.
*In Gillian Bradshaw&#x27;s 1984 &quot;Down the Long Wind&quot; series, Cei is Arthur&#x27;s infantry commander. He is a large man with fiery hair and a temper to match, but with a strong sense of honour and loyalty to Arthur.
*In Stephen R. Lawhead&#x27;s &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot; Kay, spelled Cai, is Arthur&#x27;s most loyal companion. As a child he had a crippled leg and Arthur was one of the few who defends him. This earns Arthur his complete and unquestioning loyalty. He dies in the battle against Mordred.
*In comedy TV series &quot;Kaamelott&quot;, Kay is portrayed as a rogue centurion and rival of Arthur named Caius who refused to follow his troops back to Rome and therefore Celticised his name and was given knighthood by Arthur to end their rivalry.
*He appears in Philip Reeve&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Here Lies Arthur,&quot; as Cei, Arthur&#x27;s loyal half-brother and friend to the bard Myrddin (Merlin) at the beginning, before their friendship wanes over his stories designed to improve Arthur&#x27;s reputation. He is later murdered in person by a character known as &#x27;The Irishman&#x27;, while riding to the Irishman&#x27;s aid against raiders. The Irishman attacked their camp overnight, on the order of Myrddin, as many viewed him as a superior leader to Arthur. The other members of Arthur&#x27;s army who were untrusted were also killed by the Irishman and his soldiers. The main character, Gwyn/Gwyna, and Peredur (Percival), were the only two to escape and survive the attack.
*In the 2011 TV series &quot;Camelot&quot;, Kay is played by Canadian actor Peter Mooney. In this American-Irish-Canadian adaption of Arthurian Legend, Kay is portrayed as a loyal and protective older brother to Arthur. Although raised in a rural setting, he appears educated and somewhat idealistic, described by the actor who plays him as having &quot;a world of book-smarts, but no practical experience [of how be a warrior]&quot;.
*Sir Kay briefly appears in the season 5 opener of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, where he betrays Arthur and attempts to pull Excalibur out of the stone to rule Camelot for himself. When he attempts to do so, he is proven unworthy, and the protection around the sword turns him to dust.

<doc id="406372" wikidata="Q18977149" url="?curid=406372" title="Cobble Hill, Brooklyn">
<text>Cobble Hill is a neighborhood in the northwestern portion of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. A small neighborhood comprising 40 blocks, Cobble Hill sits adjacent to Brooklyn Heights to the north, Boerum Hill to the east, Carroll Gardens to the south, and the Columbia Street Waterfront District to the west. It is bounded by Atlantic Avenue (north), Court Street (east), Degraw Street (south) and the Brooklyn Queens Expressway (west). Other sources add to the neighborhood a rectangle bounded by Wyckoff Street on the north, Hoyt Street on the east, Degraw Street on the south, and Court Street on the west.

Through its early history, the area now called &quot;Cobble Hill&quot; was considered to be part of South Brooklyn, Red Hook, or simply the Sixth Ward, or as part of Brooklyn Heights. The current name, a revival of a name which had died out by the 1880s, was adopted in 1959. Much of the neighborhood, which has &quot;one of the city&#x27;s finest collections of nineteenth-century houses&quot;, is included in the Cobble Hill Historic District.

Cobble Hill is part of Brooklyn Community District 6 and its ZIP Codes are 11201 and 11231. It is served by the 76th Precinct of the New York City Police Department at 191 Union Street. Fire services are provided by the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s Engine Company 206 and Ladder Company 108, located in nearby Carroll Gardens.

==History==
===Early history and development===
Cobble Hill – which was named after the conical shaped hill called &quot;Cobleshill&quot; or &quot;Ponkiesbergh&quot;, located where the current intersection of Atlantic Avenue, Pacific Street, and Court Street now lies – was originally settled during the 1640s by Dutch farmers when Willem Kieft, the director of New Netherland, granted patents in the area. The hill was used as a fort – known as &quot;Cobble Hill Fort&quot;, &quot;Smith&#x27;s Barbette&quot;, or &quot;Corkscrew Fort&quot; – during the American War of Independence; the British cut off the top of the hill during their occupation, so it could not be used to look down on their headquarters in Brooklyn Heights. They also seized the estate of Philip Livingston for use as a naval hospital. Cobble Hill was again fortified for the War of 1812, and was then called &quot;Fort Swift&quot;.

In 1834, the Village of Brooklyn – chartered in 1816 and primarily made up of present-day Brooklyn Heights – became a city and soon expanded south beyond Atlantic Street (now Atlantic Avenue) to include South Brooklyn.

Until the establishment of the South Ferry, which connected Atlantic Avenue to Manhattan&#x27;s Whitehall Street in 1836, South Brooklyn was primarily rural. After that time, with the guidelines for a gridiron street pattern already established in 1834, the area developed rapidly. New streets were being laid progressively, and with the development of new buildings – which started nearer to the waterfront and moved inward – the rural community slowly started changing into a middle-class suburban residential community dominated by small rows of houses, which began to be built as early as 1835. The transformation of the neighborhood was nearly completed by 1860; none of the farm houses from the neighborhood&#x27;s rural period are extant.

According to the 1840 tax list and street directory, the neighborhood of present-day Cobble Hill contained 45 houses and 112 residents. Although this housing boom caused prices to rise, in 1850 it was still possible for a clerk to pay rent of $200 a year () for a row house with a large backyard, albeit on a narrow lot. This provoked an influx of new residents from Manhattan.

Philanthropist Alfred Tredway White built two experimental housing projects in the neighborhood. These were the Romanesque revival &quot;Towers&quot; and &quot;Home&quot; buildings (now collectively known as Cobble Hill Towers), at 417–435 and 439-45 Hicks Street, meant as affordable housing for the working class, with adequate light and air for all; and the &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Cottages&quot; of Warren Place, a one block mews from Warren Street to Baltic Street between Henry and Hicks Streets, which was two rows of narrow single family houses ( wide) built around a private courtyard. These were intended for slightly more upscale workers. All were built on adjoining lots in 1876 and were designed by William Field &amp; Son; they were restored in 1986 by Maitland, Strauss &amp; Behr. With these projects, which served Native Americans, Irish, Swedes, Norwegians, English, and German workmen, White became the first builder of low rent/low profit housing in the United States. His philosophy was &quot;Philanthropy plus 5%&quot;.

Beginning in the 1840s and progressing into the 1870s, wealthier Manhattanites, including bankers and merchants, began to move to various parts of Brooklyn, including Cobble Hill. By 1880, the population of the area was solidly upper-middle class and the cost of houses had almost equaled those in Brooklyn Heights, of which Cobble Hill was an outgrowth.

The &quot;Cobble Hill Historic District Designation Report&quot; lists the architecture of the neighborhood as including many rowhouses in the Greek Revival and Italianate styles and their offshoots, but also examples of the Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Queen Anne, French Second Empire, and neo-Grec styles.

===20th century===
The 20th century saw an influx of immigrants into the neighborhood from Ireland, Italy, and the Middle East; some low-rise apartment buildings were constructed prior to the 1920s. After a period of relative quiet, by 1950, brownstones were being rejuvenated and the neighborhood began to experience a renaissance, leading to the revival of the &quot;Cobble Hill&quot; name, perhaps engendered by a real estate agent who saw the name &quot;Cobles Hill&quot; on a 1766 map and updated it. Organized community groups fought against large housing projects, and prevailed on the city to make the area an historic district.

The historic district – first designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (NYLPC) on December 20, 1969 and extended on June 7, 1988, – is roughly bordered by Atlantic Avenue to the north, Court Street to the east, Degraw Street to the south, and Hicks Street to the west, with a &quot;bite&quot; removed from the northeast corner of that rectangle. Its area measures approximately twenty-two city blocks. According to the NYLPC, the Cobble Hill Historic District is an &quot;unusually fine 19th century residential area&quot; and &quot;retains an aura of the past with its charming streets and architecture&quot;. The Cobble Hill Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Today on the two main commercial streets – Court and Smith Streets – generations-old family-run stores and businesses such as Italian meat markets and barber shops sit side by side with trendy new shops, restaurants, and cafes. Atlantic Avenue, the northern border of the neighborhood, features one of New York City&#x27;s largest collections of Middle-Eastern shops, some of which have been there for decades. The northern part of Smith Street is known as Brooklyn&#x27;s &quot;Restaurant Row&quot; due to the large number of eateries and watering holes that opened on the street during the late 1990s and early 2000s. With a second blossoming of specialized bars along the corridor in the late 2000s, Smith Street became an upscale weekend nightlife destination.

==Cobble Hill Park==

Cobble Hill Park, on Clinton Street between Verandah Place and Congress Street, was created in 1965. The site had been the location of two mansions (the Weber and Whitten Mansions) and the Second Unitarian Church, which was abandoned by the 1940s, when the site was purchased by the Bohack Corporation, a supermarket chain. The mansions were demolished, and in the 1960s the corporation planned to build a supermarket on the site, a proposition which was opposed by the Cobble Hill community, which felt the need for a park for the neighborhood. Bohack sold the site to developers in 1962, who planned to build a low-rise apartment building. The community collected signatures and successfully petitioned the city to create a park.

The city bought the property in 1963 and the park was dedicated in 1965. It was reconstructed in 1989, winning the 1988 Annual Award for Excellence in Design from the Art Commission and the Parks Council&#x27;s Philip Winslow Award for Public Projects in 1990, the first time it was awarded. The new design reflected the 19th-century brick-and-stone character of the tree-lined neighborhood.

==Education==
===Schools===
* Public School 29, also known as the John M. Harrigan School, is a school located on Henry Street.
* The building on Baltic Street that formerly housed Intermediate School 293 – which closed in 2005 due to poor performance – now contains two 6–12th grade schools:
** Digital Arts and Cinema Technology High School occupies the top floor
** The School for International Studies is on the bottom floor.
* Success Academy Cobble Hill, a charter primary school, opened in August 2012.

Though there are no public libraries in Cobble Hill itself, Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) operates two branches nearby:
* The Carroll Gardens branch, located at 396 Clinton Street near Union Street, in Carroll Gardens
* The Pacific branch, located at 25 Fourth Avenue near Pacific Street, in Boerum Hill

==Religion==
The neighborhood has a multitude of churches, many of them dating from prior to the Civil War. Some have been converted for residential use.
* Christ Church and Holy Family at Clinton and Kane Streets, built in 1840–41, was an early design in the Gothic Revival style by Richard Upjohn Some of the interior furnishings are by Louis Comfort Tiffany, and date from 1937. Christ Church was the first organized religious group in the Cobble Hill area, having been founded in 1835. The congregation later merged with that of the Church of the Holy Family.
* Old St. Paul&#x27;s Church at Court and Congress Streets was designed by Gamaliel King and built c.1838, allowing the claim that this church is the oldest Roman Catholic church in continuous use in Brooklyn. The steeple was added in the 1860s, and other enlargements were made. The church front faces Court Street, the chapel and former rectory face Congress Street. The parish was originally largely Irish.
* Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes, which splintered off an earlier congregation, is located at 236 Kane Street in Cobble Hill, in the former Middle Dutch Reformed Church, built in the Romanesque style c.1856. It is currently the oldest continuously operating synagogue in Brooklyn.
* St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church on Hicks Street, built in 1860 and designed by Patrick Charles Keely, was part of a complex which included the church, a school, and a hospital. The church and the school have been converted to host condominium apartments. The original parish was largely Italian.
* South Brooklyn Seventh-Day Adventist Church at 249 Degraw Street was built in 1905 as the Trinity German Lutheran Church, and was designed by Theobald Engelhart.
* St. Francis Cabrini Roman Catholic Chapel at Degraw Street and Strong Place was built in 1851–52 as the Strong Place Baptist Church. It was designed by Minard Lafever in the Gothic Revival style. The building was converted into apartments in 2010.
* The Second Unitarian Church, known as the &quot;Church of the Turtle&quot; because it physically resembled one, was designed by Jacob Wrey Mould and built in 1858 on the site where Cobble Hill Park is today.
==Hospitals==

In the northeast corner of the neighborhood, located partially in the Historic District, was University Hospital of Brooklyn at Long Island College Hospital, which was founded by German immigrants in 1857. It began a school of medicine, the Long Island College of Medicine, in 1850; the school became a separate institution in 1930, and since 1954 was the primary teaching affiliate of SUNY Downstate Medical Center. The first private bacteriological laboratory in the United States, Hoagland Laboratory, was built in 1888 at 335 Henry Street, but was destroyed by fire and is no longer extant. The Polhemus Building, now Polhemus Memorial Clinic, was built in 1897 and was designed by Marshall Emery in the French Mannerist style. Dudley Memorial, designed by William Hough was built in 1902. Other buildings were designed by D. Everett Waid and William Higginson. Further expansion took place in the modern era, with buildings raised in 1963, 1974, 1984, and 1988. The hospital was the sixth largest in Brooklyn. After the closure of Long Island College Hospital in August 2014, a freestanding emergency department—NYU Cobble Hill, part of NYU Langone Medical Center—opened in October 2014. The hospital plans to replace the existing facility with a new ambulatory care center and freestanding emergency department at the site, estimated to cost $200 million.

==Other points of interest==
* The DeGraw Mansion, also known as the Ralph L. Cutter House, at Clinton and Amity Streets, was built in 1845 and altered in 1891 with a tower in order to see the harbor, the view of which had become blocked by the development of the neighborhood.
* The former Dr. Joseph E. Clark House, at 340 Clinton Street between Degraw and Kane Streets, was built c.1860, and is &quot;the widest single house in Cobble Hill&quot;.
* 272 Warren Street, a neo-Grec house built c.1899, stands out from its neighbors
* 174 Pacific Street between Clinton and Court Streets, was built in 1889 as Public School 78
* The commercial building that now houses Trader Joe&#x27;s, formerly the South Brooklyn Savings Institution and then the Independence Savings Bank, was built in 1922 and was designed by McKenzie, Voorhees &amp; Gmelin in the Florentine Renaissance style. Located at 130 Court Street at Atlantic Avenue, it was added to in 1936 by Charles A. Holmes. The cornice features one hundred eagles. The site is the location where General George Washington watched his troops retreat from the Battle of Long Island.

==Transportation==


The Cobble Hill Tunnel, under Atlantic Avenue, was built in 1844 to replace the railroad tracks that ran down the middle of Atlantic Avenue as part of the Atlantic Avenue Railroad. Trains used these tracks to transport goods to and from the waterfront during the 1840s, and the tunnel was built to avoid the trains&#x27; need to climb a steep hill. The tunnel is now abandoned, but originally ran from Times Plaza to the Ferry Terminal. The brick-lined vaulted tunnel is high by wide and long. Walt Whitman, the poet and editor of the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;, said the tunnel was &quot;a passage of solemnity and darkness&quot;.

New York City Subway service is available at the Bergen Street station on the IND Culver Line (). The (Atlantic Avenue) and (Court Street) bus routes also serve the area.

In June 2017, NYC Ferry&#x27;s South Brooklyn route started stopping at Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 6 on the border of Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights.

There are plans to build the Brooklyn–Queens Connector (BQX), a light rail system that would run along the waterfront from Red Hook through Cobble Hill to Astoria in Queens. However, the system is projected to cost $2.7 billion, and the projected opening has been delayed until at least 2029.

<text>Barbara Radding Morgan (born November 28, 1951) is an American teacher and a former NASA astronaut. She participated in the Teacher in Space Project as backup to Christa McAuliffe for the 1986 ill-fated STS-51-L mission of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;. In 1998, eight years after the Teacher in Space Project had ended, she was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate, training as a mission specialist; astronaut Morgan flew on STS-118 in August 2007. As such, she became the first teacher (by original career) to go into space.

==Early life and education==
Morgan was born to Dr. and Mrs. Jerry Radding in 1951 and raised in Fresno, California, where she attended Herbert Hoover High School. Following graduation in 1969, she was accepted to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where she graduated with distinction in 1973 with a B.A. in Human Biology. She obtained her teaching credential from Notre Dame de Namur University in nearby Belmont in 1974.

==Teaching career since 1974==
Morgan began her teaching career in 1974 on the Flathead Indian Reservation at Arlee Elementary School in Arlee, Montana, where she taught remedial reading and math. From 1975 to 1978, she taught remedial reading/math and second grade at McCall-Donnelly Elementary School in McCall, Idaho. From 1978 to 1979, Morgan taught English and science to third graders at Colegio Americano de Quito in Quito, Ecuador, for a year. From 1979 to 1998, Morgan taught second, third, and fourth grades at McCall-Donnelly Elementary School.

==Teacher in Space Project==

Morgan was selected as the backup candidate for the NASA Teacher in Space Project on July 19, 1985. From September 1985 to January 1986, Morgan trained with Christa McAuliffe and the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; crew at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. Following McAuliffe&#x27;s death in the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, Morgan assumed the duties of Teacher in Space Designee. From March 1986 to July 1986, she worked with NASA, speaking to educational organizations throughout the country. In the fall of 1986, Morgan returned to Idaho to resume her teaching career. She taught second and third grades at McCall-Donnelly Elementary and continued to work with NASA&#x27;s Education Division, Office of Human Resources and Education. Her duties as Teacher in Space Designee included public speaking, educational consulting, curriculum design, and serving on the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Federal Task Force for Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering.

==NASA career==
In January 1998, 12 years after McAuliffe&#x27;s death, Morgan was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate (mission specialist) and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1998 to begin training to become a full-time astronaut. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch. She served in the Astronaut Office CAPCOM Branch, working in Mission Control as prime communicator with on-orbit crews.

Like many other astronauts and cosmonauts, Morgan is a licensed amateur radio operator, having passed the technician class license exam in 2003. This qualified her to use the facilities of the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) project.

Morgan was initially scheduled to fly on the STS-118 mission on Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; in November 2004. During the disaster that destroyed &quot;Columbia&quot; in February 2003, she was aboard a training chase plane which was following the shuttle as it prepared to land. As a result of the disaster, STS-118 was delayed until 2007 and was moved to &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

Morgan&#x27;s duties as a mission specialist were no different than those of other crew members. While NASA press releases and media briefings often referred to her as a &quot;mission specialist educator&quot; or &quot;educator astronaut&quot;, Morgan did not train in the Educator Astronaut Project. NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin clarified at a press conference after STS-118 that Morgan was not considered a mission specialist educator, but rather was a standard mission specialist, who had been a teacher.

Prior to her flight on STS-118, NASA seemed to limit Morgan&#x27;s exposure to the press, but she did a series of interviews shortly before the start of the mission about what the crew of STS-118 would be doing to help build the International Space Station, commenting, &quot;You know, there&#x27;s a great sense of pride to be able to be involved in a human endeavor that takes us all a little bit farther. When you look down and see our Earth, and you realize what we are trying to do as a human race, it&#x27;s pretty profound.&quot;

Three weeks after Morgan&#x27;s mission ended, she conducted her first space education assignment at Walt Disney World in Florida. Morgan&#x27;s words from that day were etched into a plaque on a wall of Mission: Space. The &quot;Wall of Honor&quot; contains quotes from notable people, such as Neil Armstrong, John F. Kennedy, Charles Lindbergh, Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, Galileo, and Christa McAuliffe. Morgan&#x27;s plaque is placed beside McAuliffe&#x27;s, which says: &quot;Space is for everybody ... That&#x27;s our new frontier out there.&quot; This event was one of a series of lectures Morgan would complete.

===Spaceflight experience===
STS-118, an assembly mission to the International Space Station, successfully launched from Florida&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center at 6:36:42 p.m. EDT, 8 August 2007. Morgan served as robotic arm operator and transfer coordinator, coordinating the transfer of over of cargo to the International Space Station, and bringing home over . In addition to her other duties, Morgan participated in twenty-minute amateur radio question-and-answer sessions with young people at the Discovery Center of Idaho and other centers, and joined Mission Specialist Alvin Drew in an education event with young people at the Challenger Center for Space Science Education in Alexandria, Virginia. The event was hosted by June Scobee, widow of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;″s commander, Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Scobee. The center honored Morgan with the &quot;President George H.W. Bush Leadership Award&quot;. STS-118 landed successfully at Kennedy Space Center on August 21, a day ahead of schedule due to concerns about Hurricane Dean.

==Post-NASA career==
On June 28, 2008, Morgan announced that she would leave NASA for a teaching job at Boise State University. In August 2008, Morgan took a full-time position as a distinguished educator in residence; a dual appointment to BSU&#x27;s colleges of engineering and education. There she advises, leads and represents the university in policy development, advocacy and fund-raising in science, technology, engineering and math.

On July 4, 2008, Morgan received the &quot;Friend of Education&quot; award from the National Education Association. The following month, Barbara R. Morgan Elementary School opened in McCall, Idaho.

She appeared on the 2020 Netflix documentary miniseries &quot;&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Morgan received the Adler Planetarium Women in Space Science Award in 2008.

Actress Mary Chris Wall portrayed Morgan in the 1990 television film &quot;Challenger&quot;.

==Personal life==
Morgan is married to writer Clay Morgan of McCall, Idaho; they have two sons. She is a classical flutist who also enjoys jazz, literature, hiking, swimming, and cross-country skiing.

<doc id="406375" wikidata="Q1053709" url="?curid=406375" title="Iwami Province">
<text>was an old province of Japan in the area that is today the western part of Shimane Prefecture. It was sometimes called . Iwami bordered Aki, Bingo, Izumo, Nagato, and Suō provinces.

In the Heian period (794–1192) the capital was at modern-day Hamada. 
In the Kamakura period (1192–1333) the Masuda clan belonged to the Minamoto clan (Genji) and conquered Iwami Province. From the sixteenth century onwards, it played an important role in East Asia&#x27;s economic history as a major silver source.

==History==
During the Muromachi and Sengoku periods, the battles were very furious in this area.
At first, the Masuda clan was in alliance with the Ōuchi clan in neighboring Suō, but later the Masuda clan belonged to the Mōri clan in neighboring Aki.

On 16 June 1026, a tsunami struck the Sea of Japan coast of present-day Masuda, Shimane, killing more than 1,000 people.

Maps of Japan and Iwami Province were reformed in the 1870s when the prefecture system was introduced. At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes. For example, Iwami is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

<doc id="406385" wikidata="Q146553" url="?curid=406385" title="Herne Hill">
<text>Herne Hill is a district in south London, approximately four miles from Charing Cross and bordered by Brixton, Camberwell, Dulwich, and Tulse Hill. It sits to the north and east of Brockwell Park and straddles the boundary between the boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. There is a road of the same name in the area (which is part of the A215), as well as a railway station.

==Toponymy==

In Rocque&#x27;s 1746 map, the area is shown as &quot;Island Green&quot;, probably reflecting the presence of the River Effra and smaller tributaries. Early references to the area also use the form &quot;Ireland Green&quot;.

The earliest documented reference to &quot;Herne Hill&quot; is in two fire insurance policies issued by the Sun Insurance Company in 1792 (where the spelling is &quot;Hearns&quot; and &quot;Herns&quot; Hill).

==History==
===1291 – Manor of Milkwell===
The area now known as Herne Hill was part of the Manor of Milkwell, which existed from at least 1291, and was a mixture of farms and woodland until the late 18th century. It was divided between the ancient parishes of Camberwell and Lambeth. 

===1783 – Samuel Sanders===
In 1783, Samuel Sanders (a timber merchant) bought the land now occupied by Denmark Hill and Herne Hill from the Manor; he then began granting leases for large plots of land to wealthy families.

===Mid-19th century===
By the mid-19th century, the road from the modern Herne Hill Junction to Denmark Hill was lined with substantial villas set in spacious grounds and the area had become a prosperous suburb for the merchant class. (John Ruskin grew up, from the age of 4, in a house on Herne Hill, until moving in 1842 to a large villa on Denmark Hill).
===1862 – arrival of the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway===
Herne Hill was transformed by the arrival of the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway in 1862. Cheap and convenient access to London Victoria, the City of London, Kent and south-west London created demand for middle-class housing; the terraced streets that now characterise the area were constructed in the decades after the opening of Herne Hill station and the old estates were entirely built over.

===World War II===
During World War II five V-1 flying bombs fell at various sites in the Herne Hill area, causing six deaths.

===August 2013 floods===
During the early morning of 7 August 2013, an 88‑year‑old 0.9 m diameter water main on Half Moon Lane burst, flooding Herne Hill, Dulwich Road and Norwood Road along with 36 properties (including the Half Moon public house) to create a scene described as &quot;biblical&quot; by local residents. Thames Water admitted liability and estimated the total cost of the damage to be around £4 million. The Half Moon reopened in March 2017, following a vigorous local campaign to save it as a pub; Southwark Council has designated it an asset of community value.

==Local landmarks==
===Brockwell Park===
The area is home to the Brockwell Park. Near a hilltop in Brockwell Park stands the Grade II* listed Brockwell Hall, which was built in 1811–13 to the design of the architect David Riddall Roper. The hall and the land surrounding it were opened to the public in 1891 after being purchased by London County Council. Brockwell Park hosts the annual Lambeth Country Show and was the site of London&#x27;s Gay Pride festival for several years in the 1990s. The park also houses Brockwell Lido, a 1937 open-air swimming-pool that faces on to Dulwich Road, Grade II listed in 2003.

===The railway station===
Herne Hill railway station on Railton Road was opened by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1862; the Gothic, polychrome brick station building was Grade II listed in 1998. The associated railway viaduct and bridges are also noteworthy; &quot;The Building News&quot; stated in 1863 that the viaduct was &quot;one of the most ornamental pieces of work we have ever seen attempted on a railway&quot; for its fine brickwork.

===Herne Hill Velodrome===
The Herne Hill Velodrome, situated in a park off Burbage Road, was built in 1891 and hosted the track cycling events in the 1948 Summer Olympics. Unlike most modern, steeply-banked velodromes, it is a shallow concrete bowl; as of 2010 the &#x27;Save the Herne Hill Velodrome&#x27; campaign was seeking a way to secure the future of the site. The same park also has a football pitch and was the home of Crystal Palace F.C. from 1915 until 1918.

===Sam Mussabini – 84 Burbage Road===
A Blue plaque at 84 Burbage Road marks the former home of the athletics coach Sam Mussabini. In 1894, Mussabini was appointed coach to the Dunlop cycling team which trained at the Herne Hill Velodrome. In 1913, Mussabini was appointed coach to the Polytechnic Harriers at the Herne Hill athletics track, which ran round the inside of the Velodrome cycle track. Here he trained athletes, including the fourteen-year-old Harold Abrahams. Mussabini was later immortalised in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, in which he was played by actor Ian Holm.

===Conservation area===
In recognition of the historical importance and specialist character of the area within its urban context, Stradella Road was designated as a conservation area, by Southwark Council in 2000, under the Civic Amenities Act of 1967. The conservation area consists principally of properties in Stradella and Winterbrook Roads and also includes bordering properties in Burbage Road and Half Moon Lane.

===Public houses=== 

The Half Moon public house in Half Moon Lane was built in 1896 (although a tavern has existed on the site since the 17th century) and was Grade II* listed in 1998. The pub was formerly a popular live music venue and hosted a boxing gym for more than 50 years. The freehold of the pub belongs to the Dulwich Estate. The Commercial in Railton Road was rebuilt in 1938, and is locally listed by Lambeth Council as an inter-war pub of architectural and historic interest.

===St Paul&#x27;s Church===
The Church of St Paul on Herne Hill was originally built by G. Alexander in 1843 at a cost of £6,707, but dramatically rebuilt by Gothic architect G.E. Street in 1858 after a destructive fire, although the tower and spire were saved. It is now Grade II* listed.

===Sunray Gardens pond===
The lake in Sunray Gardens (at the junction of Elmwood Road and Red Post Hill) was originally the fish pond in the grounds of Casino House (a large estate established in 1796/97, demolished 1906); the adjoining Casino Estate still bears the house&#x27;s name. The estate, now a conservation area, was built by Camberwell Borough Council after World War I, modelled on the garden suburb ideal and part of the drive to provide Homes Fit for Heroes.

===Delawyk Crescent===
Delawyk Crescent is a housing estate with an unusual Radburn layout, separating vehicle and pedestrian movements. It was built in the 1960s and 1970s on land from the Dulwich Estate.

===Hurst Street Estate===
Hurst Street Estate comprises two pentagon plan tower blocks, Park View House and Herne Hill House, both 19 storeys (52 meters) high which dominate the skyline of the area. Completed in 1968 by Lambeth Borough Council, they each contain 72 dwellings.

===Carnegie Public Library===
The Carnegie Public Library on Herne Hill Road (not to be confused with the much older road known as Herne Hill) opened in 1906 after a Lambeth librarian was awarded a grant from Andrew Carnegie for building a library within the Herne Hill area. It is also a listed Grade II building.

===Sax Rohmer – 51 Herne Hill===
A Blue plaque at 51 Herne Hill (by the junction with Danecroft Road) marks the former home of author Sax Rohmer (a.k.a. Arthur Henry Ward), most famous as author of the series of novels featuring the fictional master criminal Dr. Fu Manchu.

== Politics ==
Herne Hill is represented on Southwark Council by councillors for Dulwich Village ward (two councillors) and on Lambeth Council by councillors for Herne Hill and Loughborough Junction ward (three councillors) and West Dulwich ward (two councillors). All three wards are currently represented by councillors from the Labour Party. Herne Hill is represented in the London Assembly by Marina Ahmad and in Westminster by Helen Hayes.

==Transport==

=== Buses ===
The London bus routes are 3, 37, 42, 68, 196, 201, 322, 468, P4 school route 690 and night buses N3 and N68.

=== Rail ===
Direct rail services are available from Herne Hill railway station to Blackfriars, City Thameslink, Farringdon, St Pancras International, and St Albans (all via the Thameslink Wimbledon loop) and Victoria (via Southeastern Metro Bromley South line).

Nearby railway stations offer services to other destinations: London Bridge can be reached from North Dulwich and Tulse Hill; Denmark Hill has trains to Clapham Junction and Highbury and Islington via the London Overground&#x27;s South London Line. The nearest London Underground station is Brixton on the Victoria line. There have been past proposals to extend the Victoria line to Herne Hill station on a large reversing loop.

<text>A carrel desk is a desk, often found in libraries, with partitions at back and sides to provide privacy.

== Description ==
Carrel desks are especially common in academic libraries. 
Sometimes the seat is integrated with the carrel desk. They may also have a shelf, built-in illumination, electrical outlets, or Ethernet ports. Unlike the cubicle desk, carrel desks usually have no file drawers or other facilities.
They are designed to stand alone or to be grouped together, with or without common sides or walls.

The word &quot;carrel&quot; may also refer to a small, isolated &quot;study room&quot; in public libraries and on university campuses; the room may have a lockable door, to which the user is granted the key on request. Carrels typically contain a desk (not necessarily one described as above), shelving and a lamp.

==Origins==
Carrels originated in monasteries to help contain the cacophony of roomfuls of monks reading aloud, as was the early practice. Carrels are first recorded in the 13th century at Westminster Abbey, London, on the Garth side of the North Walk, though they probably existed from the late years of the 12th century.

<text>Brockwell Park is a 50.8 hectare (125.53 acres) park located south of Brixton, in Herne Hill and Tulse Hill in south London. It is bordered by the roads Brixton Water Lane, Norwood Road, Tulse Hill and Dulwich Road.

The park commands views of the skyline of the city and Central London, and hosts almost 4 million annual
visits. At the top of the hill within the park stands Brockwell Hall.

Whilst competing against multiple demands from a broad range of other interests, the entirety of Brockwell Park is a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) of Borough Importance (Grade I), with mature trees including ancient oaks, substantial lawn areas set to meadow, and a series of lakes. As well as adding to the landscape value, these support a variety of birds, and bats including Pipistrelles, with frequent visits from rarer species like Daubentons, Noctule, Leisler&#x27;s and Serotine bat.

The park is listed for its heritage value on The National Heritage List for England, Parks &amp; Gardens, Grade II. Noted for its nineteenth-century layout as a gracious public park, the clocktower, water garden, JJ Sexby-designed walled garden and other monuments, the park provides a pleasant exploration with links to its eighteenth-century agricultural past in the hedge lines, and mature oak trees. The model village houses outside the walled garden were originally donated to London County Council by Edgar Wilson in 1943.

The Brockwell Lido, a Grade II listed art deco building near the north of the park, is an open-air swimming pool popular with swimmers and bathers. Its attached café/restaurant is also popular. Other amenities in Brockwell Park include tennis courts, a bowling green, a BMX track and a miniature railway.

Brockwell Park is open from 7.30am to 15 minutes before sunset every day.

==History==

The Grade II* listed Brockwell Hall was built between 1811 and 1813 when the area was part of Surrey and was the country seat of glass merchant John Blades Esq. The land and house were acquired by the London County Council (LCC) in March 1891 and opened to the public on 2 June in the following summer, led by the local MP Thomas Lynn Bristowe. At the unveiling, Bristowe died of a heart attack on the steps of the hall.

In 1901, the LCC acquired a further of land north of the original park. In the 1920s, there were 13 cricket pitches in the park, which attracted crowds of up to 1,500. Brockwell Park was home to the Galton Institute.

During World War I it is recorded that Brockwell Park grazed a large flock of sheep. During World War II, three sites in the park were set aside for wartime food production in the form of &#x27;Pig Clubs&#x27;, built of timber and bricks salvaged from bombed houses. Pig swill for this purpose was collected from local homes.

A bust of Thomas Bristowe was returned to the park and unveiled on its 120th birthday, 2012.

The park is Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==Festivals and shows==

The park is home to the free Lambeth Country Show, which usually takes place over two days in July, attracting crowds of up to 150,000 people. A ticketed annual fireworks display, attracting 30,000 people, also takes place around November 5.

Paid-for music events have been taking place in Brockwell Park for a number of years, including Found Festival in 2016 and Sunfall Festival in 2017. As far back as 1913, it was said that, &quot;On the whole probably the people in Brockwell Park, like those in Hyde Park and the other parks, would refuse the weaker Italian stuff and demand the Wagner over and over again&quot;.

There is local opposition of monetizing the park and the erection of a 12 foot high steel fence around the pay to enter large festivals. The park has previously hosted large-scale free to attend un-fenced music events, including an estimated crowd of 150,000 in attendance at a Rock Against Racism carnival in September 1978, headlined by Elvis Costello and The Attractions, and with &quot;people in trees, on the roofs of the flats and on the lido wall&quot;. Costello ended his Brockwell Park performance with the song &#x27;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&#x27;. A further Rock Against Racism event including performances by Aswad and Stiff Little Fingers was also held in the park in September 1979.

In May 1981, Aswad and Pete Townshend &quot;swigging Remy Martin brandy&quot; headlined a TUC benefit gig for the &#x27;People&#x27;s March For Jobs&#x27; campaign, with a crowd of 70,000 in attendance. In May 1982, Brockwell Park hosted a Cannabis Law Reform Rally, including &quot;a wicked turbo sound rig with Jah Shaka, Coxone, King Sounds and DBC Rebel Radio´s boxes all connected in a huge horseshoe&quot;. Madness also headlined a Greater London Council / CND &#x27;Festival for Peace&#x27; in Brockwell Park in 1983, compered by John Peel, with a crowd of 30,000 in attendance. Paul Weller&#x27;s new band The Style Council made only their second public appearance at this festival. Unfortunate scheduling of the support acts, meant that many arriving in Brockwell Park hoping to see The Damned had already missed their 35-minute set, and subsequent support acts, including The Style Council and Hazel O&#x27;Connor, were pelted with mud, amid chants of &quot;We want The Damned&quot;.

In August 1984, the park hosted a GLC free festival, where Leader Ken Livingstone gave a speech, and the increasingly rowdy crowd during performances by The Fall and Spear of Destiny was calmed by poet Benjamin Zephaniah before the headline set by The Damned. One eyewitness recalls The Fall being pelted with cans during their performance, with singer Mark E. Smith narrowly dodging one effort, &quot;about an inch from his face, when he suddenly twitched to the right and let it sail past him&quot;.

The park has also hosted reggae festivals, and the London Pride festival in 1993 and 1994. In May 1994, an Anti Nazi League Carnival in Brockwell Park featured performances by The Manic Street Preachers, The Levellers, and Billy Bragg. Between 2000 and 2004, the park even hosted an annual cannabis festival. The cannabis festival was eventually stopped in 2005 by Lambeth Council, after drug dealing at previous events.

In June 2002, Australian band Midnight Oil headlined The Fierce Festival in Brockwell Park in front of a crowd of 20,000 people. A dance event called Purple in the Park was held on the preceding day, headlined by Grace Jones, and including performances by Boy George and Yoko Ono. The two events, held over the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee weekend, had a capacity set at 50,000.

In January 2018, Lambeth Council announced that Field Day Festival had been given permission to hold its event in Brockwell Park. Acts lined up for June 2018 included Erykah Badu, Thundercat, and Four Tet.

The San Francisco band Red House Painters wrote a song about the park, named &quot;Brockwell Park&quot;, for their 1995 album &quot;Ocean Beach&quot;. The Ocean Beach album also features an unlisted hidden track, referred to as &quot;Brockwell Park (Part 2)&quot;.

In a 2015 Adele at the BBC TV special, singer and songwriter Adele stated that her song &quot;Million Years Ago&quot; is, &quot;kind of a story about … I drove past Brockwell Park, which is a park in south London I used to live by. It’s where I spent a lot of my youth. It has quite monumental moments of my life that I’ve spent there, and I drove past it and I just literally burst into tears&quot;.

Brockwell Park is the setting for the music video of &quot;Do Your Thing&quot; by local band Basement Jaxx.

Brockwell Park was used as a filming base camp for the 2015 movie The Man from U.N.C.L.E directed by Guy Ritchie.

The park is a key location in Mo Hayder&#x27;s crime novel &quot;The Treatment&quot;.

<text>Brockwell Lido is a large lido in Brockwell Park, Herne Hill, London. It opened in July 1937, closed in 1990 and after a local campaign was re-opened in 1994. Two ex council employees Paddy and Casey took on the running of the Lido for the community. Lambeth council gave Paddy &amp; Casey a peppercorn lease rate from 1994–2001. Lambeth gave them a one-year extension in 2002 whilst a public consultation was held to decide on the longer term sustainable future of the Lido.

== History ==
Brockwell Lido was designed by Harry Rowbotham and T. L. Smithson in the Moderne style for the London County Council&#x27;s Parks Department. It replaced the Brockwell Park bathing pond and is almost identical in design to the Victoria Park Lido in Hackney. It opened in July 1937.

The lido closed in 1990 due to cost-saving measures by Lambeth Borough Council. A Brockwell Lido Users (BLU) group was established in 2001 to lobby for re-opening. The lido management was put out for tender and two former council employees won the contract and reopened the lido in 1994.

Lucy Blakstad&#x27;s film &quot;The Lido&quot; was filmed at Brockwell Lido in 1995.

The lido has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since July 2003.

== Description ==
In 2001, the Evian logo was painted on the pool floor in a sponsorship deal worth £110,000. In 2005, £500,000 was awarded from the Heritage Lottery Fund as part of the £2.5 million redevelopment.
2001 was also the year BLU were officially formed as a pressure group to save the Lido. With the backing of over 1000 local Lido lovers and swimmers, they demonstrated to Lambeth council the passion that the &#x27;local&#x27; people and community had for their Lido. Lambeth brought in Consultants and public meetings were held to establish the best solution to save and preserve the Lido for future generations. A Brockwell Lido Steering Group was created with three of the six stakeholders coming from BLU.

In 2003 Fusion Lifestyle won the competitive tender from Lambeth Council to refurbish Brockwell Lido and create an all year round leisure complex at the site. A newly built gym, spa and fitness studios were constructed over four years and the newly expanded Brockwell Lido site was reopened in October 2007.

In 2012 the &#x27;Brockwell Icicles&#x27; winter swimming group reformed and campaigned for all year round swimming... the current operator Fusion agreed. BLU with the help of BLSC, finally obtained 7 day swimming for the Lido in 2014. Brockwell Lido is now open 7 days a week all year for those who enjoy cold water swimming. (Membership is not required and new cold water swimmers can turn up and pay on the day)

In 2016 in April, Fusion finally installed a poolside sauna at the Lido and later that year at the BLU &amp; BLSG AGM, Fusion agreed to open the whole pool every day from 1 November 2016, all thanks to a concerted campaign by BLU on behalf of the Lido users.

The Lido Café is an attached café/restaurant looking onto the pool.

==Εvents==
On 25 July 2019, amidst record high temperatures across the UK, the police were called as around 500 people tried to &quot;storm&quot; Brockwell Lido.

<text>Fort Chipewyan , commonly referred to as Fort Chip, is an unincorporated hamlet in northern Alberta, Canada, within the Regional Municipality (RM) of Wood Buffalo.

==History==
Fort Chipewyan is one of the oldest European settlements in the Province of Alberta. It was established as a trading post of the North West Company in 1788, named after the Chipewyan people living in the area. Its original location was Old Fort Point, on the southwest shore west of the Old Fort River.

One of the founders of the fort, Roderick Mackenzie of Terrebonne, had a taste for literature. Later he opened correspondence with traders all over the north and west, asking for descriptions of scenery, adventure, folklore and history. He also founded a library at the fort that was not only for the residents of Fort Chipewyan, but also for traders and clerks of the whole Lake Athabasca region. He hoped it would be what he called, in an imaginative and somewhat jocular vein, &quot;the little Athens of the Arctic regions.&quot; This library, started in 1790, held more than 2000 books. It became one of the most famous in the whole extent of Rupert&#x27;s Land.

In 1798, Fort Chipewyan was relocated to its current site on the north shore. In 1802, the HBC set up another post on English Island at the lake&#x27;s outlet, called Nottingham House, but was abandoned in 1806.

From about 1815 to 1821 the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) operated a competing Fort Wedderburn (named after Andrew Colvile&#x27;s family) on Coal or Potato Island from the North West Company&#x27;s fort. This fort was established by John Clarke, and Sir George Simpson stayed here 1820–1821, during which time he reorganized the fur trade. When the HBC and NWC merged in 1821, Fort Wedderburn was abandoned and all HBC&#x27;s fur-trade operations moved to Fort Chipewyan.

Sir John Franklin set out from Fort Chipewyan on his overland Arctic journey in 1820. 

In 1887–1888 there was a great famine in the Fort Chipewan area. Electricity and electric lights arrived in Fort Chipewyan in 1959.

In 2023 about a thousand people were evacuated from the centre due to threat by a wildfire.

=== Historic sites ===
Old Fort Point, the site of the first Fort Chipewyan, established southeast of Fort Chipewyan in 1788, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1930. 

Historic places in the community include the site of the third Fort Chipewyan established in 1803, the Anglican Church built in 1880 and Day School built in 1874, and the Roman Catholic Mission Church built in 1909.

==Geography==
It is located on the western tip of Lake Athabasca, adjacent to Wood Buffalo National Park, approximately north of Fort McMurray.

=== Climate ===
Fort Chipewyan has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with long, very cold, dry winters and short, warm, wetter summers. The highest temperature ever recorded in Fort Chipewyan was on 30 June 2021. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 1 February 1917.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Fort Chipewyan had a population of 798 living in 309 of its 387 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 852. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The population of Fort Chipewyan according to the 2018 municipal census conducted by the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo is 918, a decrease from its 2012 municipal census population count of 1,008.

As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Fort Chipewyan had a population of 852 living in 295 of its 372 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 847. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

The hamlet&#x27;s population is predominantly made up of Cree and Chipewyan (Dene) First Nations and Métis people.

== Transportation ==
=== Air ===
The hamlet is served by the Fort Chipewyan Airport, opened on June 18, 1966. Air is one of two methods of access to Fort Chipewyan in the summer.

=== Water ===
In the summer, the hamlet also can be accessed by boat from Fort McMurray via the Athabasca River.

=== Road ===
There are no all-weather roads to Fort Chipewyan, but it can be reached via winter roads in the winter. These include roads from Fort Smith to the north and from Fort McMurray to the south. In June 1998, and as part of the Northwestern Canadian Integrated Road Network Plan, the Alberta government conducted studies on all-weather road access by extending the existing Highway 63 from Fort McMurray. As of 2008 Highway 63 has been extended from Fort McMurray to Syncrude; there are currently no plans on extending it further to Fort Chipewyan. In December 2005, one-third of Fort Chipewyan&#x27;s residents signed a petition to request the government to build a all-weather road to connect with existing roads to the northwest that provide access to Fort Smith, Northwest Territories. The major expenditure would be a bridge over the Slave River.

==Solar energy==
In September 2014, the community of Fort Chipewyan in collaboration with Keepers of the Athabasca installed a 1.8 kW solar array on the roof of the Elder Lodge to be used for emergency backup power. An energy baseline study was completed for Fort Chipewyan by the Pembina Institute in 2012.

The table below shows the mean daily global insolation (kWh/m2) in Fort Chipewyan for each month of the year using five different fixed solar array orientations and one which tracks the sun. The data was provided by Natural Resources Canada&#x27;s Municipality database of photovoltaic potential and insolation which used data collected over 50 years from 144 locations compiled from Environment Canada&#x27;s CERES CD.

===Fort Chipewyan Solar Farm===
The Fort Chipewyan Solar Farm was developed by Three Nations Energy LP, and constructed in 2019 through 2020. ATCO was the designer and builder, and operates the system. The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, Mikisew Cree First Nation, and Fort Chipewyan Métis Local 125 own the project. The solar farm is expected to supply approximately 25 percent of Fort Chipewyan&#x27;s energy and annually replace 800,000 litres of diesel fuel. A battery storage system will store 1.5 MWh of power.

Phase 1 was planned to include 1,500 panels (400 kW) but was reported at the project completion as a 600 kW facility, while phase 2 was planned include 6,000 panels and was reported at the project completion to include 5,760 panels with the planned output of 2,200 kW. The Government of Canada provided $4.5M and the Government of Alberta provided $3.3M of the project&#x27;s $7.8M cost.

ATCO will buy the solar farm&#x27;s energy under a long-term purchase agreement and supply it to the local power grid, which is disconnected from the province-wide grid. ATCO stated that with the completion of the 2.2 MW-capacity project, about 25 fewer tanker trucks will trek across the winter ice road connecting the community with Fort McMurray, 220 kilometres to the south. In the summer, the community is only accessible by air or barge.

<doc id="406402" wikidata="Q7442210" url="?curid=406402" title="Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad">
<text>The Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad (earlier Seattle and Walla Walla Railroad and Transportation Company) was a narrow gauge railroad and was the first proper railroad to serve Seattle, Washington, preceded only by horse-drawn rail vehicles and by a coal train making the very short haul from Lake Union to Pike Street. Despite its ambitious name, actual construction never went beyond King County, the county of which Seattle itself is the seat. After being sold to Henry Villard&#x27;s Oregon Improvement Company in 1880 it was renamed the Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad. In 1916, that became the Pacific Coast Railroad Company.

==History==
===Seattle and Walla Walla===
When the Northern Pacific Railway chose nearby Tacoma as its western terminus (1873), many thought that this would condemn Seattle to, at best, a secondary role on Puget Sound. While most of the other towns that were passed over in favor of Tacoma simply accepted their fate, Seattle did not. Selucius Garfielde proposed a railway east through Snoqualmie Pass to the grainfields of Eastern Washington.

The railroad was incorporated September 19, 1873. Its founding trustees were Arthur Denny, John Collins, Franklin Mathias, Angus Mackintosh, Henry Yesler, James McNaught, J. J. McGilvra, J. M. Colman, and Dexter Horton. They ventured to Walla Walla, where they were given a warm welcome, but that city lacked Seattle&#x27;s concern for the project: they already had land transport to Portland, Oregon, not to mention access to the Columbia River.

J. M. Colman, owner of the Seattle lumber mill founded by Henry Yesler, emerged as the leader of the enterprise. He staked US$20,000 of his own money—a fortune in those days, especially during the slow recovery from the Panic of 1873—on the condition that other Seattle businessmen would loan the enterprise at least twice that sum. Colman brought in labor contractor Chin Gee Hee, who organized cheap Chinese labor to continue the construction. (Chin would eventually become a railway entrepreneur in his native China.)

Despite Walla Walla&#x27;s lack of interest, construction began on May 1, 1874, at Steele&#x27;s Landing in Georgetown, the present-day intersection of E. Marginal Way S. and S. Lucille St., which was then near the mouth of the Duwamish River, later re-channeled and straightened. Twelve miles of track had been completed by October of that year, entirely through volunteer labor by the men of Seattle. The line reached the coal fields of Renton in 1877, with the first train running on March 7 and regular commercial runs commencing October 15. Coal made the line profitable, even if it did nothing to link Seattle to the national rail infrastructure.

The most difficult part of building the line was the trestle ran south from the King Street Coal Wharf, carrying trains through the tide flats that would later be filled to form Seattle&#x27;s Industrial District. Joe Surber sunk numerous piles into the flats, using his pile driver. The resulting trestle was short-lived, though: shipworms attacked the pilings, and this portion of the line had to be replaced by the successor Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad less than five years after it was initially built.

On January 18, 1878 the railroad made it as far as the coal fields of Newcastle, ultimately of railway with five locomotives, two passenger cars and sixty freight cars, but never attracted the capitalization that would take it anywhere near the city of Walla Walla from which it took half its name.

Henry Villard&#x27;s Oregon Improvement Company bought the Seattle and Walla Walla November 25, 1880, combined it with the Seattle Coal and Transportation Co., and renamed it the &quot;Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad&quot;. The sale was quite profitable for the line&#x27;s owners, but still did little to connect Seattle to the national land transportation grid.

===Columbia and Puget Sound===

The Columbia and Puget Sound Railroad Company (C&amp;PSRR), successor to the Seattle and Walla Walla, was incorporated November 26, 1880, the day after the purchase. Like its predecessor, the C&amp;PSRR continued to lay track in the coal-rich terrain of Western Washington, mainly extending lines south and east from Renton via Black Diamond to Franklin (December 1884), but also extending service a short distance from Newcastle to nearby Coal Creek in December 1881. Additional short lines out of Black Diamond would eventually go to Denny (renamed Bruce in 1897) and to Kummer; the latter opened no later than June 30, 1903); about halfway between Renton and Black Diamond, a line was extended from Maple Valley to Taylor (a company town owned by the Denny Clay Company) around May 1893. The C&amp;SPRR eventually had of track.

The C&amp;PSRR gave Seattle at least a tenuous link to major railways to its south and east. At Maple Valley, it connected to a line owned by the Milwaukee Road, the Chicago, &amp; Puget Sound Railway Company. Beginning July 1, 1884, a third rail on C&amp;PSRR track from Black River Junction north to Argo allowed the Northern Pacific to run their wide-gauge trains on C&amp;PSRR&#x27;s otherwise narrow-gauge track, and reach Seattle from the south with their Puget Sound Shore Railroad.

The Puget Sound Shore Railroad was never really an adequate connection to the nation&#x27;s railroad network. The line was built from the Black River Junction via Kent to Stuck Junction (about halfway between Sumner and Kent), leading in theory to the Northern Pacific&#x27;s main terminal at Tacoma, but the Northern Pacific largely declined to operate the line. The name &quot;Stuck Junction&quot; became all too apt. &quot;[S]ervice was unpredictable and sometimes absent altogether,&quot; charges were high, and no break bulk cargo was allowed (an individual merchant had to ship and receive by the carload). This situation drove Seattle to look at the possibility of connecting north, leading to the creation of the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern. There were various degrees of accommodation at various times, but it would not be until 1902 that a genuinely amicable agreement was reached with Northern Pacific, with details finalized in 1903.

The Great Seattle Fire in June 1889 destroyed C&amp;PSRR&#x27;s Seattle station, shops, roundhouse, coal bunkers, all of its wharves, four freight cars and a locomotive. The railroad was up and running again by the end of the year. The Panic of 1893 severely impacted the Oregon Improvement Company, which went into receivership in 1895, emerging in 1897 as the Pacific Coast Company, a name the reflected its inclusion of the Pacific Coast Steamship Company.

C&amp;PSRR upgraded to standard gauge, work that was completed in November 1897. The 1903 agreement with Northern Pacific gave C&amp;PSRR a good route to access Pacific Coast Steamship Company&#x27;s new Seattle coal pier at Dearborn Street, where they built a new roundhouse just off of Railroad Avenue (later Alaskan Way).

In 1909, following up on a 1906 agreement, the Milwaukee Road was extended similar trackage rights from the south to what had been granted to the Puget Sound Shore Railroad. By 1913, the C&amp;PSRR was operating 11 locomotives, 8 passenger cars, 152 freight cars, and 236 coal cars. The C&amp;PSRR was consolidated into the Pacific Coast Railroad Company on March 26, 1916.

===Pacific Coast Railroad Company===

The Pacific Coast Railroad Company was incorporated November 27, 1897, but did not operate until March 23, 1916. The line from Renton to Newcastle and Coal Creek was closed in 1933. The last of the extensions out of Black Diamond, to Franklin, was closed in 1936. In 1945 the line from Maple Valley to Taylor was closed, and in 1947 the stretch between Maple Valley and Henry&#x27;s shut as well, leaving only the lines from Seattle via Black River Junction and Renton to Maple Valley, and from Henry&#x27;s to Black Diamond, a total of about of track.

In 1951, the Pacific Coast Railroad became a subsidiary of the Great Northern. It was sold to Burlington Northern (now part of the BNSF Railway) March 2, 1970.

<text>The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (SLS&amp;E) was a railroad founded in Seattle, Washington, on April 28, 1885, with three tiers of purposes: Build and run the initial line to the town of Ballard, bring immediate results and returns to investors; exploit resources east in the valleys, foothills, Cascade Range, and Eastern Washington in 19th-century style, attracting more venture capital; and boost a link to a transcontinental railroad for Seattle, the ultimate prize for incorporation. The historical accomplishment of the line was Seattle to Sumas at the border, with British Columbia, Canada, connecting with the Canadian Pacific transcontinental at the border at Huntingdon, British Columbia, now part of the City of Abbotsford.

In addition to the historical accomplishment, the SLS&amp;E built and ran branches from Seattle through Bothell, on to Woodinville, to Sallal Prairie (just past North Bend); Salmon Bay (the industrial district of the town of Ballard); and Spokane to Davenport. Toward the latter end, one goal was creating a rail connection to North Dakota via Wallula, an outpost on the Columbia River in the early decades of railroad booms, near the present Tri-Cities. Local historian William Speidel reported that Henry Villard, tycoon of the Northern Pacific Railway (NP), had the federal rights and had the line through Wallula built. The SLS&amp;E was first incorporated to build a line from the Seattle harbor in old Downtown, along Elliott Bay to the lumber and fishing town of Ballard.

Subsequent to its abandonment in 1971, a southern portion of the railroad’s right-of-way re-opened in 1978 as the Burke-Gilman Trail.

==Promoting a railroad empire involving Seattle==


Railroading in Seattle closely paralleled development and early hopes for the future. Like communications networks today, 19th century railroading represented more than track, stock, and trade. Romantic and practical potential wooed communities across the West, much as Web commerce and bandwidth today (bandwidth was narrow, desire high, competition passionate). Travel between America&#x27;s coasts had taken months, whether overland by wagon or by sailing ship or steamer around Cape Horn, until the Union Pacific reached San Francisco in 1869 and the Northern Pacific opened to Tacoma in 1887.

The SLS&amp;E was conceived and financed by Seattle business interests in response to Villard of the NP selecting Seattle&#x27;s intense rival Tacoma as its transcontinental western terminus, and incorporated on 15 April 1885. The original scheme for the SLS&amp;E was connecting with an intercontinental railroad somewhere, while actually building north and east from Seattle. By the late 1880s, the SLS&amp;E needed more capital for ongoing construction toward Sumas and an extension toward Spokane. The Seattle &amp; Eastern Construction Company was formed with many of the same investors as the SLS&amp;E. Construction of the eastern line began in Spokane. By the end of 1889, construction ended, having only reached Sallal Prairie, some miles past North Bend and from the Seattle station on Western Avenue at Columbia Street. In 1890, the plans were amended to focus on connecting Seattle to the Canadian Pacific Railway at Sumas on the border.

Local historian William Speidel (1967) observed that,
At best, insider boosters had hoped they might get as far as Denny&#x27;s Iron Mountain in Snoqualmie Pass. While the SLS&amp;E was designed to connect with one of the other transcontinentals, its primary purpose lay in 19th-century industrial development exploiting the city&#x27;s hinterland: the fast-disappearing easy timber, then primarily coal and iron. A theory, which later became profitable in fact, was that commuter trains could run along the SLS&amp;E track, and be only twenty scenic minutes away from the center of the city. Ever since, every suburb around the perimeter of the city has been advertised as only &quot;twenty scenic minutes away from downtown.&quot;

The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad was a pretty weak reed for Seattle to cling to. City boosters blew a lot of money on that railroad and when they were through, it had only been built as far east as Rattlesnake Prairie above Snoqualmie Falls and as for north as Arlington. But it was the only hope that Seattle-New York Alki held out for a connection with a transcontinental system. On the other hand, the side benefits of the SLS&amp;E enabled boosters to hit the jackpot with the Great Northern.

The verso of a promotional print celebrating an opening excursion of the SLS&amp;E stated, The Seattle Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad company was organized April 15, 1885 and was financed by local men and Jamieson, Smith and Cotting of New York. The first division of the road was to Issaquah where the coal mines would furnish cargoes. The first depot of the road was built at the foot of Columbia Street, but as space for trackage and terminals was too limited, the city created Railroad Avenue, 120 feet wide. The city gave the new road thirty feet of the Avenue for trackage and offered the Northern Pacific an equal amount which was not accepted. Construction was soon started from the eastern end of Spokane and forty miles of road built. Startled by the success of this competing line, the Northern Pacific purchased control and abandoned its fight against Seattle in 1890. [The quote is text on the verso of a silver gelation print, &quot;Excursion on the Seattle Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad, n.d.&quot;, A. Curtis 59932.]

The SLS&amp;E accomplished Seattle to Sumas at the Canada–US border, connecting with the Canadian Pacific transcontinental, late 1880s-1892; with branches of approximately from Seattle through Bothell, Woodinville Junction to Sallal Prairie (North Bend) (about downtown Seattle to the prairie), 1886–1889; from downtown to Salmon Bay and spur to the town of Ballard, 1885; a Winsor branch (through Bothell and up North Creek); and Spokane to Davenport, in 1888–1889.

&quot;[A]ll along the line the road&#x27;s construction caused a tremendous stir ... logging camps, mills, mines, and towns sprang into existence as if by magic.&quot; The SLS&amp;E boosted not only the town of Ballard (connected 1886), but new towns like Ross, Fremont, Latona (in what is now east Wallingford, Brooklyn (in what is now west University District), Yesler (now part of Laurelhurst), Bothell (Thanksgiving, 1887) and towns out to Gilman (now Issaquah).

The verso of a print in UW archives noted, August 20, 1894. Wreck on [the] Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern just west of Latone [now Latona Avenue]. Freight train from Gilman [now Issaquah] hit a cow. [Trainload was a] [m]ixer freight train, 10 co[a]l cars, logs and box cars. Train had slowed down at Brooklyn [Avenue] for cows. Engineer saw cows on a bank beyond Latona looking (?) one another[!]. One cow was tossed over [the] bank and hit the track just as [the] engine came by. [The] [e]ngine was raised off the track[,] and when it came down [the] wheels went off the rails. Engineer reversed but [it] was too late. [The] [c]oal tender shot ahead[,] tearing part of car [(the engine cab)] off and decapitating [the] fireman and killing [the] brakeman. Engineer and coal passer [were] unhurt. Steam and dust enveloped the derailed cars. Engineer ran to Fremont to telegraph to stop [the] evening passenger train[;] also [illegible] Engineer claimed train going 20 miles per hr.The streets at that time were rural, more tracks or plat lines than avenues. The run to Fremont Station was more than a mile (about 1.6 km). A small freight depot remains today at the foot of Stone Way N.

==Bankruptcy==
The company entered receivership on July 1, 1893, and continued to operate. The company was sold on May 16, 1896, and the assets split between two companies. The Spokane and Seattle Railway acquired the eastern line between Spokane and Davenport, while the Seattle and International Railway acquired the western lines around Seattle.

==Building the SLS&amp;E in Eastern Washington==

The SLS&amp;E was planned to be a larger railroad than it ultimately became. Construction was in two parts, with the eastern Washington section started in Spokane and headed west, begun in the late 1880s by largely the same group of investors incorporating the Seattle &amp; Eastern Construction Company.

An old map shows the proposed line going from Davenport to Coulee City, up the Grand Coulee to Waterville, then on to Wenatchee, then along the Wenatchee River, and up over part of Stevens Pass then over toward Everett. With what is known today about Cascade Range topography that was little-known or unknown back then, how much was promotion and how much was actually expected according to the insiders&#x27; business plan remains part of the intrigue of railroad history.

The steam locomotive &quot;A. M. Cannon.&quot; SLS&amp;E number 11, was named after a prominent Spokane resident. Cannon was very instrumental in the building of the SLS&amp;E in the Spokane area.

It has been reported that the Great Northern (GN) used the SLS&amp;E bridge over the Spokane River while the GN was building its own during its transcontinental construction in 1893.

The eastern Washington line became the Spokane &amp; Seattle Railway, which was purchased by the NP in two parts. The first—Medical Lake to Davenport—was purchased in 1899. The remainder, between Medical Lake and Spokane, was bought in 1900.

==Recent history==
The western Washington lines remained in fairly heavy use until 1963. By 1970, most of the line was acquired by Burlington Northern Railway which filed to abandon the lines a year later in 1971. Seven years later, in 1978, the between Gas Works Park in Seattle and Tracy Owen Station in Kenmore was reopened as the Burke-Gilman Trail bike path and recreational rail trail, named after the leaders of the group that founded the railroad, Thomas Burke and Daniel Gilman. The bike path and rail trail has been extended along the SLS&amp;E line west through Interbay, and extending east from Jerry Wilmot Park, South Woodinville, the King County Regional Trail system
leads to the cross-state John Wayne Pioneer Trail. A section of the railway, between Snoqualmie Falls and North Bend, was preserved in 1975, and is now owned and operated by the Northwest Railway Museum.

In eastern Washington, the Northern Pacific abandoned the section between Spokane and Medical Lake right after purchase, preferring to use their own branch from Spokane, the Central Washington Branch (CW Branch). The section from Medical Lake to Davenport was operated for a time before the line was trimmed back to include only an spur out of Davenport to Eleanor. The Washington Water Power Company purchased the right-of-way between Spokane and Medical Lake from the Northern Pacific on or about 2 March 1904, for use as an interurban passenger railway. It remained in use as an interurban until early 1922, before the rails were torn up again. The only remaining eastern Washington section by 1970 was the spur out of Davenport that ran to Eleanor, abandoned in 1983. As of May 2019 the only remaining section is the Wye going south of Davenport; it is now used to turn locomotives around and storage for the Washington Eastern Railroad.

The right-of-way has long since reverted to adjacent landowners and has been used for other purposes, having been abandoned 1922–1983. If these lines had been operated in a more urban setting, and in more recent times, they might have been converted to use today as a trail. But at the time this line was abandoned, the rails to trails movement had not begun. By today much of the lines in the open country of Eastern Washington have gone the way of the &quot;disappearing railroad blues.&quot; Some sections can still be seen, but otherwise much of it has become roadways or disappeared into history.

<text>Bruneau Dunes State Park is a public recreation and geologic preservation area in the western United States, located in Owyhee County in southwestern Idaho. It is northeast of Bruneau and south of Mountain Home.

Featuring large sand dunes and small lakes, the state park is the site of North America&#x27;s tallest single-structured sand dune, which is approximately in height. The park encompasses and features the Bruneau Dunes Observatory, where visitors can use a telescope for stargazing.

==Natural history==
;Geology
The park&#x27;s dunes are unique in the Western Hemisphere: where others in the Americas form at the edge of a natural basin, the Bruneau dunes form near the center. The basin has acted as a natural trap for over 12,000 years. The dunes may have started with sands from the Bonneville Flood about 15,000 years ago. With prevailing winds blowing from the southeast 28 percent of the time and from the northwest 32 percent of the time, the dunes stay fairly stable, and unlike most dunes, do not drift far.
;Flora and fauna
The state park includes desert, dune, prairie, lake and marsh habitat. Desert wildlife is prominent along with birds of prey and waterfowl.

==Park history==
Land for the park was purchased under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act in May 1967. Additional acreage was acquired in 1980 and in 1984, bringing the park&#x27;s total area to .

==Recreation==
Activities include sandboarding, fishing, birdwatching, camping, hiking, swimming, and viewing the stars at the public observatory. No motorized vehicles are allowed on the dunes; climbing and sledding are permitted. There are and horseback riding trails around the dunes. An educational center offers natural history displays. The astronomical observatory is open Friday and Saturday evenings mid-March through mid-October.

<text>The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia () is promulgated by the Croatian Parliament.

== History ==
While it was part of the socialist Yugoslavia, the Socialist Republic of Croatia had its own Constitution under the Constitution of Yugoslavia.

Following the first multi-party parliamentary elections held in April 1990, the Parliament made various constitutional changes. On December 22, 1990, they rejected the communist one-party system, adopted a liberal-democratic constitution and dropped the &#x27;Socialist&#x27; label from the country&#x27;s name, becoming Republic of Croatia.
The document is sometimes known as the Christmas Constitution ().

The Constitution was amended in early 1998.

The Constitution of 1990 used the semi-presidential model of the French Fifth Republic, with broad Presidential executive powers shared with the Government.

In 2000, and again in 2001, the Croatian Parliament amended the Constitution changing bicameral parliament back into historic unicameral and reducing the Presidential powers.

The Constitution was most recently amended in 2013. This constitutional amendment defines marriage within Croatia as a union between a man and a woman. Effective 1 January 2014.

== Contents ==
=== Historical foundations ===
This is the preamble of the Constitution. It explains how the Croats managed to preserve their national identity throughout centuries in various forms of states from the formation of Croatian principalities in 7th century until present days.
The millenary identity of the Croatian nation and the continuity of its statehood, confirmed by the course of its entire historical experience within different forms of states and by the preservation and growth of the idea of a national state, founded on the historical right of the Croatian nation to full sovereignty, manifested in:
*the formation of Croatian principalities in the seventh century;
*the independent mediaeval state of Croatia founded in the ninth century;
*the Kingdom of the Croats established in the tenth century;
*the preservation of the identity of the Croatian state in the Croatian-Hungarian personal union;
*the independent and sovereign decision of the Croatian Parliament of 1527 to elect a king from the Habsburg dynasty;
*the independent and sovereign decision of the Croatian Parliament of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1712;
*the conclusions of the Croatian Parliament of 1848 regarding the restoration of the Triune Kingdom of Croatia under the authority of the ban grounded on the historical, national and natural right of the Croatian nation;
*the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868 on the relations between the Kingdom of Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia and the Kingdom of Hungary, grounded on the legal traditions of both states and the Pragmatic Sanction of 1712;
*the decision of the Croatian Parliament of 29 October 1918 to dissolve state relations between Croatia and Austria-Hungary and the simultaneous affiliation of independent Croatia, invoking its historical and natural right as a nation, with the state of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, proclaimed on the former territory of the Habsburg monarchy;
*the fact that the Croatian Parliament had never sanctioned the decision of the National Council of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs to unite with Serbia and Montenegro in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1 December 1918), subsequently (3 October 1929) proclaimed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia;
*the establishment of the Home Rule (Banovina) of Croatia in 1939, by which Croatian state identity was restored within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia,
*establishing the foundations of state sovereignty during the course of the Second World War, by the decisions of the Antifascist Council of National Liberation of Croatia (1943), as opposed to the proclamation of the Independent State of Croatia (1941), and subsequently in the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia (1947) and all later constitutions of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (1963–1990), on the threshold of the historical changes, marked by the collapse of the communist system and changes in the European international order, the Croatian nation by its freely expressed will at the first democratic elections (1990) reaffirmed its millenniary statehood. By the new Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (1990) and the victory in the Homeland War (1991–1995), the Croatian nation demonstrated its will and determination to establish and defend the Republic of Croatia as a free, independent, sovereign and democratic state.

Considering the presented historical facts and universally accepted principles of the modern world, as well as the inalienable and indivisible, non-transferable and nonexhaustible right of the Croatian nation to self-determination and state sovereignty, including its fully maintained right to secession and association, as basic provisions for peace and stability of the international order, the Republic of Croatia is established as the nation state of the Croatian people and the state of the members of autochthonous national minorities: Serbs, Czechs, Slovaks, Italians, Hungarians, Jews, Germans, Austrians, Ukrainians, Rusyns, Bosniaks, Slovenians, Montenegrins, Macedonians, Russians, Bulgarians, Poles, Roma, Romanians, Turks, Vlachs, Albanians and the others who are citizens, and who are guaranteed equality with citizens of Croatian nationality and the realization of national rights in accordance with the democratic norms of the United Nations Organization and the countries of the free world.
Respecting the will of the Croatian nation and all citizens, resolutely expressed in the free elections, the Republic of Croatia is hereby founded and shall develop as a sovereign and democratic state in which equality, freedoms and human rights are guaranteed and ensured, and their economic and cultural progress and social welfare promoted.

<doc id="406418" wikidata="Q496939" url="?curid=406418" title="Levenshtein distance">
<text>In information theory, linguistics, and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. It is named after Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who defined the metric in 1965.

Levenshtein distance may also be referred to as &quot;edit distance&quot;, although that term may also denote a larger family of distance metrics known collectively as edit distance. It is closely related to pairwise string alignments.

== Definition ==
The Levenshtein distance between two strings formula_1 (of length formula_2 and formula_3 respectively) is given by formula_4 where

: formula_5
where the formula_6 of some string formula_7 is a string of all but the first character of formula_7 (i.e. formula_9), and formula_10 is the first character of formula_7 (i.e. formula_12). Either the notation formula_13 or formula_14 is used to refer to the formula_15th character of the string formula_7, counting from 0, thus formula_17.

The first element in the minimum corresponds to deletion (from formula_18 to formula_19), the second to insertion and the third to replacement.

This definition corresponds directly to the naive recursive implementation.

=== Example ===

For example, the Levenshtein distance between &quot;kitten&quot; and &quot;sitting&quot; is 3, since the following 3 edits change one into the other, and there is no way to do it with fewer than 3 edits:
# kitten → sitten (substitution of &quot;s&quot; for &quot;k&quot;),
# sitten → sittin (substitution of &quot;i&quot; for &quot;e&quot;),
# sittin → sitting (insertion of &quot;g&quot; at the end).

A simple example of a deletion can be seen with &quot;uninformed&quot; and &quot;uniformed&quot; which have a distance of 1:
# uninformed → uniformed (deletion of &quot;n&quot;).

===Upper and lower bounds===
The Levenshtein distance has several simple upper and lower bounds. These include:
* It is at least the absolute value of the difference of the sizes of the two strings.
* It is at most the length of the longer string.
* It is zero if and only if the strings are equal.
* If the strings have the same size, the Hamming distance is an upper bound on the Levenshtein distance. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols in the two strings are different.
* The Levenshtein distance between two strings is no greater than the sum of their Levenshtein distances from a third string (triangle inequality).

An example where the Levenshtein distance between two strings of the same length is strictly less than the Hamming distance is given by the pair &quot;flaw&quot; and &quot;lawn&quot;. Here the Levenshtein distance equals 2 (delete &quot;f&quot; from the front; insert &quot;n&quot; at the end). The Hamming distance is 4.

==Applications==
In approximate string matching, the objective is to find matches for short strings in many longer texts, in situations where a small number of differences is to be expected. The short strings could come from a dictionary, for instance. Here, one of the strings is typically short, while the other is arbitrarily long. This has a wide range of applications, for instance, spell checkers, correction systems for optical character recognition, and software to assist natural-language translation based on translation memory.

The Levenshtein distance can also be computed between two longer strings, but the cost to compute it, which is roughly proportional to the product of the two string lengths, makes this impractical. Thus, when used to aid in fuzzy string searching in applications such as record linkage, the compared strings are usually short to help improve speed of comparisons.

In linguistics, the Levenshtein distance is used as a metric to quantify the linguistic distance, or how different two languages are from one another. It is related to mutual intelligibility: the higher the linguistic distance, the lower the mutual intelligibility, and the lower the linguistic distance, the higher the mutual intelligibility.

==Relationship with other edit distance metrics==

There are other popular measures of edit distance, which are calculated using a different set of allowable edit operations. For instance,
* the Damerau–Levenshtein distance allows the transposition of two adjacent characters alongside insertion, deletion, substitution;
* the longest common subsequence (LCS) distance allows only insertion and deletion, not substitution;
* the Hamming distance allows only substitution, hence, it only applies to strings of the same length.
* the Jaro distance allows only transposition.

Edit distance is usually defined as a parameterizable metric calculated with a specific set of allowed edit operations, and each operation is assigned a cost (possibly infinite). This is further generalized by DNA sequence alignment algorithms such as the Smith–Waterman algorithm, which make an operation&#x27;s cost depend on where it is applied.

==Computation==
===Recursive===
This is a straightforward, but inefficient, recursive Haskell implementation of a codice_1 function that takes two strings, &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, together with their lengths, and returns the Levenshtein distance between them:

lDistance :: Eq a =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Int
lDistance [] t = length t -- If s is empty, the distance is the number of characters in t
lDistance s [] = length s -- If t is empty, the distance is the number of characters in s
lDistance (a : s&#x27;) (b : t&#x27;)
 | a == b = lDistance s&#x27; t&#x27; -- If the first characters are the same, they can be ignored
 | otherwise = 1 + minimum -- Otherwise try all three possible actions and select the best one
 [ lDistance (a : s&#x27;) t&#x27; -- Character is inserted (b inserted)
 , lDistance s&#x27; (b : t&#x27;) -- Character is deleted (a deleted)
 , lDistance s&#x27; t&#x27; -- Character is replaced (a replaced with b)


This implementation is very inefficient because it recomputes the Levenshtein distance of the same substrings many times.

A more efficient method would never repeat the same distance calculation. For example, the Levenshtein distance of all possible suffixes might be stored in an array formula_20, where formula_21 is the distance between the last formula_22 characters of string codice_2 and the last formula_23 characters of string codice_3. The table is easy to construct one row at a time starting with row 0. When the entire table has been built, the desired distance is in the table in the last row and column, representing the distance between all of the characters in codice_2 and all the characters in codice_3.

===Iterative with full matrix===
This section uses 1-based strings rather than 0-based strings. If &quot;m&quot; is a matrix, formula_24 is the &quot;i&quot;th row and the &quot;j&quot;th column of the matrix, with the first row having index 0 and the first column having index 0.

Computing the Levenshtein distance is based on the observation that if we reserve a matrix to hold the Levenshtein distances between all prefixes of the first string and all prefixes of the second, then we can compute the values in the matrix in a dynamic programming fashion, and thus find the distance between the two full strings as the last value computed.

This algorithm, an example of bottom-up dynamic programming, is discussed, with variants, in the 1974 article &quot;The String-to-string correction problem&quot; by Robert A. Wagner and Michael J. Fischer.

This is a straightforward pseudocode implementation for a function codice_6 that takes two strings, &quot;s&quot; of length &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;t&quot; of length &quot;n&quot;, and returns the Levenshtein distance between them:


function LevenshteinDistance(char s[1..m], char t[1..n]):
 // for all i and j, d[i,j] will hold the Levenshtein distance between
 // the first i characters of s and the first j characters of t
 declare int d[0..m, 0..n]
 set each element in d to zero
 // source prefixes can be transformed into empty string by
 // dropping all characters
 for i from 1 to m:
 d[i, 0] := i
 // target prefixes can be reached from empty source prefix
 // by inserting every character
 for j from 1 to n:
 d[0, j] := j
 for j from 1 to n:
 for i from 1 to m:
 if s[i] = t[j]:
 substitutionCost := 0
 else:
 substitutionCost := 1

 d[i, j] := minimum(d[i-1, j] + 1, // deletion
 d[i, j-1] + 1, // insertion
 d[i-1, j-1] + substitutionCost) // substitution
 return d[m, n]
Two examples of the resulting matrix (hovering over a tagged number reveals the operation performed to get that number):



The invariant maintained throughout the algorithm is that we can transform the initial segment into using a minimum of operations. At the end, the bottom-right element of the array contains the answer.

===Iterative with two matrix rows===
It turns out that only two rows of the table the previous row and the current row being calculated are needed for the construction, if one does not want to reconstruct the edited input strings.

The Levenshtein distance may be calculated iteratively using the following algorithm:

function LevenshteinDistance(char s[0..m-1], char t[0..n-1]):
 // create two work vectors of integer distances
 declare int v0[n + 1]
 declare int v1[n + 1]

 // initialize v0 (the previous row of distances)
 // this row is A[0][i]: edit distance from an empty s to t;
 // that distance is the number of characters to append to s to make t.
 for i from 0 to n:
 v0[i] = i

 for i from 0 to m - 1:
 // calculate v1 (current row distances) from the previous row v0

 // first element of v1 is A[i + 1][0]
 // edit distance is delete (i + 1) chars from s to match empty t
 v1[0] = i + 1

 // use formula to fill in the rest of the row
 for j from 0 to n - 1:
 // calculating costs for A[i + 1][j + 1]
 deletionCost := v0[j + 1] + 1
 insertionCost := v1[j] + 1
 if s[i] = t[j]:
 substitutionCost := v0[j]
 else:
 substitutionCost := v0[j] + 1

 v1[j + 1] := minimum(deletionCost, insertionCost, substitutionCost)

 // copy v1 (current row) to v0 (previous row) for next iteration
 // since data in v1 is always invalidated, a swap without copy could be more efficient
 swap v0 with v1
 // after the last swap, the results of v1 are now in v0
 return v0[n]
Hirschberg&#x27;s algorithm combines this method with divide and conquer. It can compute the optimal edit sequence, and not just the edit distance, in the same asymptotic time and space bounds.

=== Automata ===
Levenshtein automata efficiently determine whether a string has an edit distance lower than a given constant from a given string.

===Approximation===
The Levenshtein distance between two strings of length can be approximated to within a factor

: formula_25

where is a free parameter to be tuned, in time .

===Computational complexity===
It has been shown that the Levenshtein distance of two strings of length cannot be computed in time for any ε greater than zero unless the strong exponential time hypothesis is false.

<doc id="406422" wikidata="Q5278203" url="?curid=406422" title="Dinghy racing">
<text>Dinghy racing is a competitive sport using dinghies, which are small boats which may be rowboats, have an outboard motor, or be sailing dinghies. Dinghy racing has affected aspects of the modern sailing dinghy, including hull design, sail materials and sailplan, and techniques such as planing and trapezing.
==Organization of competitive dinghy sailing==
Dinghy racing comes under the auspices of World Sailing. Organisations such as the Royal Yachting Association, National School Sailing Association (UK) and Canadian Yachting Association (Canada) organise and regulate the sport at a national level. Sailing dinghies compete on an international, national, state, association, club and class basis, using the ISAF International Racing Rules of Sailing, which are revised every four years. There are several courses used, such as the Olympic triangle.

The International Association for Disabled Sailing (IFDS) is the body authorized by ISAF to be responsible for disabled sailing worldwide. IFDS works with yachting associations worldwide to run regional events all the way to the Paralympic Games, as well as adapt ISAF Racing Rules of Sailing to meet disability requirements. Many standard boats are suitable for people with disabilities which can be made more accessible by adaptations. More boats are being designed with disabled people in mind and used regularly around the world by people with disabilities.

===Racecourse===
Dinghies often race around a windward-leeward racecourse. There is a start/finish &quot;line&quot;, set up perpendicular to the wind, marked by a committee boat at one end, and a buoy on the other. After the starting signal, competitors are allowed to cross the line and begin to race to the next mark. The next mark is called the windward mark. The windward mark is placed directly upwind from the start/finish line. Competitors must round the mark going counterclockwise, leaving the mark on the port side of the boat. After rounding the windward mark, the fleet now heads towards the leeward mark. The leeward mark is positioned directly downwind from the windward mark, below the start/finish line. Sailors also round this mark counterclockwise. After rounding, competitors head upwind to cross the finish line. The course may require more than one lap around the marks.

Not all courses are windward-leeward. Variations include triangles, offset marks, gates, and rectangles. Sometimes the finish is to leeward instead of to windward. 

===Bermuda Fitted Dinghy racing===
In Bermuda, the Bermuda rig, now almost universal on small sailing vessels, can still be seen in its purest form in the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy, used for a series of races contested each year by the colony&#x27;s yacht clubs. The first race of this type was held in 1880, as a way of reducing the costs then experienced racing larger Bermudian sloops, with their similarly larger professional crews. BFD racing was restricted to amateurs, although each dinghy carries a crew of six.

===Single-handed or more than one crew===
Most racing dinghies can be classified as being either single-handed (one person only) such as the Laser, RS Vareo or double-handed, such as the 470, 505, Heron, Tasar, Flying Junior, International Fireball or the International Fourteen. A few classes of dinghy carry more than two crew whilst racing, typically heavier dayboat types, but also a couple of high-performance, Australian-origin skiff-type dinghies. Some classes allow children to sail double handed until a particular age and then require them to compete single-handed. Some double-handed boats are ideal for an adult and child like the Heron, while some such as the Tasar have weight restrictions which ensure they are sailed competitively by two adults or near-adults. Weight equalisation is also used on certain high-performance classes to ensure that comparative levels of performance are attained.

===One-design, or development class===
Sailing dinghies can be strict one-design, with virtually no difference between boats and strict rules controlling construction. This allows the competition to be more about sailing ability than about who can afford the newest innovation, although the weight of the boat and sail age and quality may be differentiating factors even in strict one-design classes.

At the other extreme are the development classes where there is wide leeway to experiment with the latest technology. Many classes fall in between these two extremes and allow some limited variations between the boats; this is typical in classes that have multiple builders.

One designs may be strictly controlled, as in the ubiquitous Laser, with all boats being factory produced from identical moulds, with identical rigs and sails. Strict-one designs suffer from being very crew weight specific.
 Other one-design classes such as the Europe and Flying Dutchman (1960 to 1992) allow differences in hull dimensions within certain tight tolerances. Despite these tolerances only being intended to allow some leeway for boats built by different builders, this usually results in certain builders&#x27; boats being perceived as faster due to the way they make use of the tolerances to create a subtly different hull shape. This type of one-design generally allows more freedom in choice of masts, sails and deck layouts.

Restricted classes like the National 12 and Merlin Rocket were previously referred to as one-designs, with tightly controlled rules which keep the boats closely competitive but allow the owner to customize the boat to their preferences and weight.

Full development classes such as the International Moth and International C class catamaran represent the cutting edge of the sport, with fleets being very diverse and often using the latest ideas and technology, including hydrofoils and solid wings in place of sails.

The oldest known one-design sailing dinghy is the Water Wag. Thomas Middleton proposed the idea of one design sailing punts, with centreboards all built and rigged the same in 1887. The first race took place on April 12, 1887, in Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) Harbour. The Water Wag Club still race Water Wag dinghies in Dún Laoghaire every Wednesday during the summer season.

===Olympic dinghy sailing===

Current Olympic sailing classes include several dinghy classes for both men and women, the Laser (men), Laser Radial (women), 470 (mixed), and Nacra 17 catamaran (mixed), the 49er skiff (men.), and the 49erFX skiff(women). The 49erFX is an identical hull to the men&#x27;s 49er with a slightly reduced rig and sail area to accommodate lighter women&#x27;s crews.

===In scholastic sport===
Many secondary schools and universities worldwide have adopted dinghy racing as either a club or varsity sport.

In the United States secondary school sailing is governed by the Interscholastic Sailing Association. College sailing in the United States is governed by the Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Both organizations have been in continuous existence since the early 20th century and, indeed, college racing began in 1928. College sailing in Canada is now governed by the Canadian Intercollegiate Sailing Association, founded in 2010.

In the United Kingdom secondary school sailing is governed by the National School Sailing Association. They not only organize 6 large events each year but support teachers by using sailing as a way of making education interesting and fun. They also offer schools, sailing clubs and youth clubs support on navigating the legal obligations surrounding involving youngsters in adventurous activities. They will be celebrating 50 years existence in 2012. 

Most school programs own fleets of at least 6 dinghies, and the well funded programs often have more than 20 dinghies in addition to support boats and paid coaches. Often schools cooperate with local yacht clubs to share fleets. The schools compete in both the fall and spring within regional districts and then, if they qualify through district championships, at a national championship regatta. Additionally, schools also compete in team racing regattas where they are able to compete one-on-one against other schools.

Many clubs also sponsor junior programs for younger sailors. Junior sailors generally compete in club races and, if eligible, can compete in national events like those sponsored by US Sailing and internationally.

===Handicap events - an attempt to even the playing field between different boat speeds===
Races involving mixed fleets (different classes of boat, different ages, weights and abilities of sailors) can be organised on a handicap basis. The most commonly used handicapping system is the Portsmouth yardstick, which assigns a different rating to each class of boat in a mixed fleet and (at least in theory) gives every boat an equal chance of winning. Handicaps can also be personal (sometimes called a back-calculated yardstick), taking into account the results of the sailor over past races, so an inexperienced person who sails significantly better than previously over a season or regatta can win on handicap. There are unfortunately certain classes of boats which do better or worse because of their particular handicap, and as boats are modified the handicap system are often slow to catch up. However, for the purposes of large fleet racing with many different classes, the handicap systems seem to work quite well.

===Class, association, club===
Clubs generally have a number of different classes competing on any one day, often sailing the same course at the same time, or sometimes with each class starting a few minutes apart. Keen club sailors join and compete in events with their State and National Associations. Associations generally cater for only one class of boat, but generally have competitors in several divisions.

===Competitive areas===
The UK has one of the most diverse dinghy racing scenes in the world with over 100 different classes of dinghy and strongly supported clubs both inland and around the coast.
Other competitive areas include the Eastern seaboard of the United States and Southern California. In these areas the junior programs are well funded and provide excellent training experience. The most popular boats are Naples Sabots, the Flying Junior, the Laser, 420s and 29ers.

Europe has a very active circuit in many classes. Asia, Australia and South America are all large contenders at international events,

<doc id="406427" wikidata="Q5338467" url="?curid=406427" title="Edit distance">
<text>In computational linguistics and computer science, edit distance is a string metric, i.e. a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another, that is measured by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. Edit distances find applications in natural language processing, where automatic spelling correction can determine candidate corrections for a misspelled word by selecting words from a dictionary that have a low distance to the word in question. In bioinformatics, it can be used to quantify the similarity of DNA sequences, which can be viewed as strings of the letters A, C, G and T.

Different definitions of an edit distance use different sets of like operations. Levenshtein distance operations are the removal, insertion, or substitution of a character in the string. Being the most common metric, the term &quot;Levenshtein distance&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;edit distance&quot;.

== Types of edit distance ==

Different types of edit distance allow different sets of string operations. For instance:

Some edit distances are defined as a parameterizable metric calculated with a specific set of allowed edit operations, and each operation is assigned a cost (possibly infinite). This is further generalized by DNA sequence alignment algorithms such as the Smith–Waterman algorithm, which make an operation&#x27;s cost depend on where it is applied.

==Formal definition and properties==
Given two strings and on an alphabet (e.g. the set of ASCII characters, the set of bytes [0..255], etc.), the edit distance is the minimum-weight series of edit operations that transforms into . One of the simplest sets of edit operations is that defined by Levenshtein in 1966:

:Insertion of a single symbol. If = , then inserting the symbol produces . This can also be denoted ε→, using ε to denote the empty string.
:Deletion of a single symbol changes to (→ε).
:Substitution of a single symbol for a symbol ≠ changes to (→).

In Levenshtein&#x27;s original definition, each of these operations has unit cost (except that substitution of a character by itself has zero cost), so the Levenshtein distance is equal to the minimum &quot;number&quot; of operations required to transform to . A more general definition associates non-negative weight functions ins(), del() and sub(, ) with the operations.

Additional primitive operations have been suggested. Damerau–Levenshtein distance counts as a single edit a common mistake: transposition of two adjacent characters, formally characterized by an operation that changes into .
For the task of correcting OCR output, merge and split operations have been used which replace a single character into a pair of them or vice versa.

Other variants of edit distance are obtained by restricting the set of operations. Longest common subsequence (LCS) distance is edit distance with insertion and deletion as the only two edit operations, both at unit cost. Similarly, by only allowing substitutions (again at unit cost), Hamming distance is obtained; this must be restricted to equal-length strings.
Jaro–Winkler distance can be obtained from an edit distance where only transpositions are allowed.

===Example===
The Levenshtein distance between &quot;kitten&quot; and &quot;sitting&quot; is 3. A minimal edit script that transforms the former into the latter is:

# kitten → sitten (substitute &quot;s&quot; for &quot;k&quot;)
# sitten → sittin (substitute &quot;i&quot; for &quot;e&quot;)
# sittin → sitting (insert &quot;g&quot; at the end)

LCS distance (insertions and deletions only) gives a different distance and minimal edit script:

# kitten → itten (delete &quot;k&quot; at 0)
# itten → sitten (insert &quot;s&quot; at 0)
# sitten → sittn (delete &quot;e&quot; at 4)
# sittn → sittin (insert &quot;i&quot; at 4)
# sittin → sitting (insert &quot;g&quot; at 6)

for a total cost/distance of 5 operations.

===Properties===
Edit distance with non-negative cost satisfies the axioms of a metric, giving rise to a metric space of strings, when the following conditions are met:

* Every edit operation has positive cost;
* for every operation, there is an inverse operation with equal cost.

With these properties, the metric axioms are satisfied as follows:

:(, ) = 0 if and only if a=b, since each string can be trivially transformed to itself using exactly zero operations.
:(, ) &gt; 0 when ≠ , since this would require at least one operation at non-zero cost.
:(, ) = (, ) by equality of the cost of each operation and its inverse.
:Triangle inequality: (, ) ≤ (, ) + (, ).

Levenshtein distance and LCS distance with unit cost satisfy the above conditions, and therefore the metric axioms. Variants of edit distance that are not proper metrics have also been considered in the literature.

Other useful properties of unit-cost edit distances include:

* LCS distance is bounded above by the sum of lengths of a pair of strings.
* LCS distance is an upper bound on Levenshtein distance.
* For strings of the same length, Hamming distance is an upper bound on Levenshtein distance.

Regardless of cost/weights, the following property holds of all edit distances:

* When and share a common prefix, this prefix has no effect on the distance. Formally, when = and = , then (, ) = (, ). This allows speeding up many computations involving edit distance and edit scripts, since common prefixes and suffixes can be skipped in linear time.

==Computation==

The first algorithm for computing minimum edit distance between a pair of strings was published by Damerau in 1964.

===Common algorithm===

Using Levenshtein&#x27;s original operations, the (nonsymmetric) edit distance from formula_1 to formula_2 is given by formula_3, defined by the recurrence

:formula_4
This algorithm can be generalized to handle transpositions by adding another term in the recursive clause&#x27;s minimization.

The straightforward, recursive way of evaluating this recurrence takes exponential time. Therefore, it is usually computed using a dynamic programming algorithm that is commonly credited to Wagner and Fischer, although it has a history of multiple invention.
After completion of the Wagner–Fischer algorithm, a minimal sequence of edit operations can be read off as a backtrace of the operations used during the dynamic programming algorithm starting at formula_3.

This algorithm has a time complexity of Θ() where and are the lengths of the strings. When the full dynamic programming table is constructed, its space complexity is also ; this can be improved to by observing that at any instant, the algorithm only requires two rows (or two columns) in memory. However, this optimization makes it impossible to read off the minimal series of edit operations. A linear-space solution to this problem is offered by Hirschberg&#x27;s algorithm. A general recursive divide-and-conquer framework for solving such recurrences and extracting an optimal sequence of operations cache-efficiently in space linear in the size of the input is given by Chowdhury, Le, and Ramachandran.

===Improved algorithms===
Improving on the Wagner–Fisher algorithm described above, Ukkonen describes several variants, one of which takes two strings and a maximum edit distance , and returns . It achieves this by only computing and storing a part of the dynamic programming table around its diagonal. This algorithm takes time , where and are the lengths of the strings. Space complexity is or , depending on whether the edit sequence needs to be read off.

Further improvements by Landau, Myers, and Schmidt give an time algorithm.

For a finite alphabet and edit costs which are multiples of each other, the fastest known exact algorithm is of Masek and Paterson having worst case runtime of O(nm/logn).

==Applications==
Edit distance finds applications in computational biology and natural language processing, e.g. the correction of spelling mistakes or OCR errors, and approximate string matching, where the objective is to find matches for short strings in many longer texts, in situations where a small number of differences is to be expected.

Various algorithms exist that solve problems beside the computation of distance between a pair of strings, to solve related types of problems.

* Hirschberg&#x27;s algorithm computes the optimal alignment of two strings, where optimality is defined as minimizing edit distance.
* Approximate string matching can be formulated in terms of edit distance. Ukkonen&#x27;s 1985 algorithm takes a string , called the pattern, and a constant ; it then builds a deterministic finite state automaton that finds, in an arbitrary string , a substring whose edit distance to is at most (cf. the Aho–Corasick algorithm, which similarly constructs an automaton to search for any of a number of patterns, but without allowing edit operations). A similar algorithm for approximate string matching is the bitap algorithm, also defined in terms of edit distance.
* Levenshtein automata are finite-state machines that recognize a set of strings within bounded edit distance of a fixed reference string.

== Language edit distance ==
A generalization of the edit distance between strings is the language edit distance between a string and a language, usually a formal language. Instead of considering the edit distance between one string and another, the language edit distance is the minimum edit distance that can be attained between a fixed string and &quot;any&quot; string taken from a set of strings. More formally, for any language &quot;L&quot; and string &quot;x&quot; over an alphabet , the &quot;language edit distance&quot; d(&quot;L&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) is given byformula_6, where formula_7 is the string edit distance. When the language &quot;L&quot; is context free, there is a cubic time dynamic programming algorithm proposed by Aho and Peterson in 1972 which computes the language edit distance. For less expressive families of grammars, such as the regular grammars, faster algorithms exist for computing the edit distance.

Language edit distance has found many diverse applications, such as RNA folding, error correction, and solutions to the Optimum Stack Generation problem.

<text>Deposition is the geological process in which sediments, soil and rocks are added to a landform or landmass. Wind, ice, water, and gravity transport previously weathered surface material, which, at the loss of enough kinetic energy in the fluid, is deposited, building up layers of sediment.

This occurs when the forces responsible for sediment transportation are no longer sufficient to overcome the forces of gravity and friction, creating a resistance to motion; this is known as the null-point hypothesis. Deposition can also refer to the buildup of sediment from organically derived matter or chemical processes. For example, chalk is made up partly of the microscopic calcium carbonate skeletons of marine plankton, the deposition of which induced chemical processes (diagenesis) to deposit further calcium carbonate. Similarly, the formation of coal begins with the deposition of organic material, mainly from plants, in anaerobic conditions.

==Null-point hypothesis==

The null-point hypothesis explains how sediment is deposited throughout a shore profile according to its grain size. This is due to the influence of hydraulic energy, resulting in a seaward-fining of sediment particle size, or where fluid forcing equals gravity for each grain size. The concept can also be explained as &quot;sediment of a particular size may move across the profile to a position where it is in equilibrium with the wave and flows acting on that sediment grain&quot;. This sorting mechanism combines the influence of the down-slope gravitational force of the profile and forces due to flow asymmetry; the position where there is zero net transport is known as the null point and was first proposed by Cornaglia in 1889. Figure 1 illustrates this relationship between sediment grain size and the depth of the marine environment.
The first principle underlying the null point theory is due to the gravitational force; finer sediments remain in the water column for longer durations allowing transportation outside the surf zone to deposit under calmer conditions. The gravitational effect or settling velocity determines the location of deposition for finer sediments, whereas a grain&#x27;s internal angle of friction determines the deposition of larger grains on a shore profile. The secondary principle to the creation of seaward sediment fining is known as the hypothesis of asymmetrical thresholds under waves; this describes the interaction between the oscillatory flow of waves and tides flowing over the wave ripple bedforms in an asymmetric pattern. &quot;The relatively strong onshore stroke of the waveforms an eddy or vortex on the lee side of the ripple, provided the onshore flow persists, this eddy remains trapped in the lee of the ripple. When the flow reverses, the eddy is thrown upwards off the bottom and a small cloud of suspended sediment generated by the eddy is ejected into the water column above the ripple, the sediment cloud is then moved seaward by the offshore stroke of the wave.&quot; Where there is symmetry in ripple shape the vortex is neutralised, the eddy and its associated sediment cloud develops on both sides of the ripple. This creates a cloudy water column which travels under the tidal influence as the wave orbital motion is in equilibrium.

The Null-point hypothesis has been quantitatively proven in Akaroa Harbour, New Zealand, The Wash, U.K., Bohai Bay and West Huang Sera, Mainland China, and in numerous other studies; Ippen and Eagleson (1955), Eagleson and Dean (1959, 1961) and Miller and Zeigler (1958, 1964).

=== Deposition of non-cohesive sediments ===

Large-grain sediments transported by either bedload or suspended load will come to rest when there is insufficient bed shear stress and fluid turbulence to keep the sediment moving; with the suspended load this can be some distance as the particles need to fall through the water column. This is determined by the grain&#x27;s downward acting weight force being matched by a combined buoyancy and fluid drag force and can be expressed by:

:formula_1
Downward acting weight force = Upward-acting buoyancy force + Upward-acting fluid drag force

where:
*&quot;π&quot; is the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter.
*&quot;R&quot; is the radius of the spherical object (in m),
*&quot;ρ&quot; is the mass density of the fluid (kg/m3),
*&quot;g&quot; is the gravitational acceleration (m/s2),
*&quot;Cd&quot; is the drag coefficient, and
*&quot;ws&quot; is the particle&#x27;s settling velocity (in m/s).

In order to calculate the drag coefficient, the grain&#x27;s Reynolds number needs to be discovered, which is based on the type of fluid through which the sediment particle is flowing, laminar flow, turbulent flow or a hybrid of both. When the fluid becomes more viscous due to smaller grain sizes or larger settling velocities, the prediction is less straightforward and it is applicable to incorporate Stokes Law (also known as the frictional force, or drag force) of settling.

=== Deposition of cohesive sediments ===

The cohesion of sediment occurs with the small grain sizes associated with silts and clays, or particles smaller than 4ϕ on the phi scale. If these fine particles remain dispersed in the water column, Stokes law applies to the settling velocity of the individual grains, although due to seawater being a strong electrolyte bonding agent, flocculation occurs where individual particles create an electrical bond adhering each other together to form flocs. &quot;The face of a clay platelet has a slight negative charge where the edge has a slight positive charge when two platelets come into close proximity with each other the face of one particle and the edge of the other are electrostatically attracted.&quot; Flocs then have a higher combined mass which leads to quicker deposition through a higher fall velocity, and deposition in a more shoreward direction than they would have as the individual fine grains of clay or silt.

=== The occurrence of null point theory ===

Akaroa Harbour is located on Banks Peninsula, Canterbury, New Zealand, . The formation of this harbour has occurred due to active erosional processes on an extinct shield volcano, whereby the sea has flooded the caldera, creating an inlet 16 km in length, with an average width of 2 km and a depth of −13 m relative to mean sea level at the 9 km point down the transect of the central axis. The predominant storm wave energy has unlimited fetch for the outer harbour from a southerly direction, with a calmer environment within the inner harbour, though localised harbour breezes create surface currents and chop influencing the marine sedimentation processes. Deposits of loess from subsequent glacial periods have in filled volcanic fissures over millennia, resulting in volcanic basalt and loess as the main sediment types available for deposition in Akaroa Harbour

Hart et al. (2009) discovered through bathymetric survey, sieve and pipette analysis of subtidal sediments, that sediment textures were related to three main factors: depth, distance from shoreline, and distance along the central axis of the harbour. This resulted in the fining of sediment textures with increasing depth and towards the central axis of the harbour, or if classified into grain class sizes, &quot;the plotted transect for the central axis goes from silty sands in the intertidal zone to sandy silts in the inner nearshore, to silts in the outer reaches of the bays to mud at depths of 6 m or more&quot;. See figure 2 for detail.

Other studies have shown this process of the winnowing of sediment grain size from the effect of hydrodynamic forcing; Wang, Collins and Zhu (1988) qualitatively correlated increasing intensity of fluid forcing with increasing grain size. &quot;This correlation was demonstrated at the low energy clayey tidal flats of Bohai Bay (China), the moderate environment of the Jiangsu coast (China) where the bottom material is silty, and the sandy flats of the high energy coast of The Wash (U.K.).&quot; This research shows conclusive evidence for the null point theory existing on tidal flats with differing hydrodynamic energy levels and also on flats that are both erosional and accretional.

Kirby R. (2002) takes this concept further explaining that the fines are suspended and reworked aerially offshore leaving behind lag deposits of the main bivalve and gastropod shells separated out from the finer substrate beneath, waves and currents then heap these deposits to form chenier ridges throughout the tidal zone, which tend to be forced up the foreshore profile but also along the foreshore. Cheniers can be found at any level on the foreshore and predominantly characterise an erosion-dominated regime.

=== Applications for coastal planning and management ===

The null point theory has been controversial in its acceptance into mainstream coastal science as the theory operates in dynamic equilibrium or unstable equilibrium, and many fields and laboratory observations have failed to replicate the state of a null point at each grain size throughout the profile. The interaction of variables and processes over time within the environmental context causes issues; &quot;a large number of variables, the complexity of the processes, and the difficulty in observation, all place serious obstacles in the way of systematisation, therefore in certain narrow fields the basic physical theory may be sound and reliable but the gaps are large&quot;

Geomorphologists, engineers, governments and planners should be aware of the processes and outcomes involved with the null point hypothesis when performing tasks such as beach nourishment, issuing building consents or building coastal defence structures. This is because sediment grain size analysis throughout a profile allows inference into the erosion or accretion rates possible if shore dynamics are modified. Planners and managers should also be aware that the coastal environment is dynamic and contextual science should be evaluated before the implementation of any shore profile modification. Thus theoretical studies, laboratory experiments, numerical and hydraulic modelling seek to answer questions pertaining to littoral drift and sediment deposition, the results should not be viewed in isolation and a substantial body of purely qualitative observational data should supplement any planning or management decision.

<text>Ruben III (), also Roupen III, Rupen III, or Reuben III, (1145 – Monastery of Drazark, May 6, 1187) was the ninth lord of Armenian Cilicia (1175–1187).

Roupen remained always friendly to the Crusaders in spirit. He was a just and good prince, and created many pious foundations within his domains.

==His life==
He was the eldest son of Stephen, the third son of Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia. His mother was Rita, a daughter of Sempad, Lord of Barbaron. Roupen&#x27;s father was murdered on February 7, 1165.

Roupen was in charge of Cilicia following the murder of his paternal uncle, Mleh on May 15, 1175.

On 4 February 1181/3 February 1182 he married Isabella of Toron, daughter of Humphrey III of Toron. Before Roupen&#x27;s 1188 death, Levon became the new ruler.

<text>Eduard Tubin ( – 17 November 1982) was an Estonian composer, conductor, and choreographer.

==Life==
Tubin was born in Torila, Tartu County, Governorate of Livonia, then part of the Russian Empire. Both his parents were music lovers, and his father played trombone in the village band. His first taste of music came at school where he learned the flute. Later, his father swapped a cow for a piano, and the young Eduard soon became known in the village for his playing. Eduard also played flute in the village orchestra.

Tubin entered the Tartu Teacher&#x27;s College in the newly independent Estonia in 1920. It was here he began to take an interest in composition. In 1924 he was admitted to the Tartu Higher Music School starting his studies under the guidance of the famous Estonian composer Heino Eller. He married a fellow student, Linda Pirn, in 1930 and their son Rein was born in 1932. Tubin took up work conducting in the &quot;Vanemuine&quot; theatre. During this time he also conducted one of the best-known male choirs and made several trips abroad. In 1938 he met Zoltán Kodály in Hungary, who encouraged his interest in folk songs. In 1941 he married the ballet dancer Elfriede Saarik. Their son Eino was born in 1942.
Following the Soviet re-occupation of Estonia in 1944, Tubin fled to Stockholm with his wife Erika and sons Rein and Eino. He remained in Sweden and became a Swedish citizen in 1961, although he did visit Estonia on occasions. He was offered work at the historical Drottningholm Palace Theatre restoring old operas. This left him time to devote himself to his own composition. Here he wrote most of his greatest works, including two operas, symphonies 5–10, a second concerto for violin, one concerto for double-bass and one for balalaika, a piano concertino, much piano and violin music, choir and solo songs etc. Towards the end of his life, Tubin slowly began to gain recognition, particularly after the conductor Neeme Järvi, also an Estonian, escaped to the United States in 1980. In the last year of his life his Tenth Symphony was performed on 5 concerts by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Tubin received several Swedish music awards and was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. After a long illness he died on 17 November 1982 in Stockholm.

==Style==
Tubin often used Estonian folk music in his works, for instance in the &quot;Sinfonietta on Estonian motifs&quot;. His ballet &quot;Kratt&quot; is entirely based on folk tunes. In 1938 Tubin had visited the Estonian island of Hiiumaa to collect folk songs. Tubin was also a very good orchestrator, and this can be heard particularly in the Third and Fourth symphonies.

A change took place in Tubin&#x27;s style at the end of the 1940s; the music became harmonically more astringent. The finale of the seventh symphony makes much use of a theme with all twelve notes, though it is tonal. The shift to a less nationalistic and more international style came after Tubin had fled Estonia to Sweden.
Tubin is perhaps not better known because of his displacement. Although Estonia claims him as one of their greatest composers, most of his composing was done in Sweden, which never gave him the attention he was due. Tubin is gaining recognition, however, particularly for his later symphonies and the Second Piano Sonata, which are recognised as masterpieces. Most of his works have been recorded (there are two complete recorded sets of his symphonies, conducted by Neeme Järvi and Arvo Volmer). In June 2005 the city of Tallinn observed the centennial of his birth with a festival where all of his symphonies and much of his piano and chamber music was performed. A statue of Tubin was erected in Tartu.

A Tubin Museum was opened at Alatskivi Castle near his birthplace in 2011. This has an exhibition about the composer and other members of the &quot;Tartu school&quot; of musicians who studied under Heino Eller including Alfred Karindi, Eduard Oja, Olav Roots and Karl Leichter.
The International Eduard Tubin Society was founded in Estonia in 2000. Its most important task is to produce an academically correct edition of his collected works, a work which is well in progress.

The pianist Vardo Rumessen was considered the foremost interpreter of Tubin&#x27;s works.

<text>Rahim Ademi (born 30 January 1954) is a retired Croatian Army general of Kosovar Albanian origin.

Born and raised in the village of Karač, Vushtrri, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (modern day Kosovo), Ademi graduated from the Yugoslav Military Academy in Belgrade in 1976. He was assigned to a station in Rogoznica near Šibenik in Croatia where he married and had two children.

In 1986, the Military Court in Sarajevo convicted him of &quot;counterrevolutionary acts&quot; and &quot;Albanian irredentism&quot;, but after serving a year and a half in prison, the Supreme Military Court agreed with his appeal and acquitted him. He would spend the next years serving as an officer in Sinj until 1990 when the war in Croatia was starting and he deserted the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army in order to help create Croatian army formations.

He officially joined the Ministry of the Interior in 1991 and later became part of the Croatian Army forces during the Croatian War of Independence. Between 1992 and 1993, as a Brigadier, he commanded Croatian military units in the Sinj area, with particular responsibility for the Peruća Dam. In 1993 he was assigned to the post of sub commander of the Gospić military district, but was relieved of duty later that year, after the controversial Operation Medak pocket. He later served as a sub-commander of the Split military district and was promoted to brigadier general for his achievements in Operation Storm in 1995. He remained there until 1999 when he was reassigned to the post of the Assistant Chief Inspector of the Armed Forces in Zagreb.

In 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Ademi for crimes against humanity allegedly committed against the Croatian Serbs in the Medak pocket. He was originally in the custody of the Court but was later allowed to prepare his defense free. In November 2005, in line with its completion strategy, the ICTY referred the Ademi-Norac case to the Croatian judiciary. The trial began on 18 June 2007 in front of a special bench of the Zagreb County Court with Judge Marin Mrčela presiding.

Ademi claims that the Croatian government, under international pressure, relieved him of duty in Gospić in 1993 in order to make him a scapegoat, rather than implicating commanding officers Janko Bobetko, Mirko Norac and Mladen Markač. He alleged that the Tribunal wanted him for questioning as far back as 1998 but the government did not allow him to answer their questions. On 30 May 2008, he was acquitted by the Zagreb County Court of responsibility for atrocities committed against Serb prisoners by Croat troops during Operation Medak Pocket.

In March 2010, the Supreme Court of Croatia upheld Ademi&#x27;s acquittal.

During campaign for the 2014–15 presidential election, Ademi worked as a co-coordinator for Ivo Josipović.

<doc id="406457" wikidata="Q1154693" url="?curid=406457" title="Legendary Tamil Sangams">
<text>The Tamil Sangams (Tamil: சங்கம் &quot;caṅkam&quot;, Old Tamil 𑀘𑀗𑁆𑀓𑀫𑁆, from Sanskrit &quot;saṅgha&quot;) were three legendary gatherings of Tamil scholars and poets that, according to traditional Tamil accounts, occurred in the remote past. Scholars believe that these assemblies were originally known as &quot;kooṭam&quot; or &quot;gathering,&quot; which was also a name for Madurai. Three assemblies are described. The legend has it that the first two were held in cities since &quot;taken by the sea&quot;, the first being called Kapatapuram, and the third was held in the present-day city of Madurai.

== Historical Sangam period and Sangam literature ==
The historical Sangam period, alluding to the Sangam-legends,
extended from roughly 300-200 BCE to 300 CE (early Chola period before the interregnum). In this period the earliest extant works of Tamil literature were written (also known as Sangam literature), dealing with love, war, governance, trade and bereavement. The name &quot;Sangam&quot; and the associated legends probably derive from a much later period. &quot;Sangam&quot; is aso known as &quot;koodal&quot; (Tamil: கூடல்) or &quot;gathering&quot;.

An accurate chronological assessment of literary works has been rendered difficult due to lack of concrete scientific evidence to support conflicting claims.Undue reliance on the Sangam legends has thus culminated in controversial opinions or interpretations among scholars, confusion in the dates, names of authors, and doubts of even their existence in some cases. The earliest archaeological evidence connecting Madurai and the Sangams is the 10th century Cinnamanur inscription of the Pandyas.

==Three legendary Sangams==
According to Tamil legends, there were three Sangams. 

Nilakanta Sastri observes that a sangam of Tamil poets flourished for a time in Madurai may well be a fact. But the facts regarding sangam have got mixed up with much fiction, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions from them. Kamil Zvelebil, finds a kernel of truth in them, suggesting that they may be based on one or more actual historical assemblies. Others reject the entire notion as not factual. Nevertheless, legends of the Sangams played a significant role in inspiring political, social, and literary movements in Tamil Nadu in the early 20th century.

Early literature from the pre-Pallava dynasty period does not contain any mention of the Sangam academies, although some early poems imply a connection between the city of Madurai, which later legends associate with the third Sangam, and Tamil literature and the cultivation of the language. The earliest express references to the academies are found in the songs of Appar and Sampandar, Shaivite poets who lived in the 7th century. The first full account of the legend is found in a commentary to the &quot;Iraiyanar Akapporul&quot; by Nakkīrar (c. 7th/8th century CE). Nakkīrar describes three &quot;Sangams&quot; (&quot;caṅkam&quot;) spanning thousands of years.

There are a number of other isolated references to the legend of academies at Madurai scattered through Shaivite and Vaishnavite devotional literature throughout later literature. The next substantive references to the legend of the academies, however, appear in two significantly later works, namely, the &quot;Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam&quot; of Perumpaṟṟapuliyūr Nambi, and the better-known work of the same title by Paranjothi Munivar. These works describe a legend that deals mostly with the third Sangam at Madurai, and is so substantially different from that set out in Nakkirar&#x27;s commentary that some authors such as Zvelebil speculate that it may be based on a different, and somewhat independent, tradition.

In contemporary versions of the legend, the cities where the first two Sangams were held are said to have been located on Kumari Kandam, a fabled lost continent, that lay to the South of mainland India, and which was described as the cradle of Tamil culture.

Kumari Kandam supposedly lay south of present-day Kanyakumari District and, according to these legends, was seized by the sea in a series of catastrophic floods.

==First legendary Sangam==
The First Sangam () is also known as the First Academy, and as the Head Sangam ().

The first Sangam (&quot;mutaṟcaṅkam&quot;) is described as having been held at &quot;the Madurai which was submerged by the sea&quot;, or known among historians as Kapatapuram, lasted a total of 4400 years, and had 549 members, which supposedly included some gods of the Hindu pantheon such as Siva, Kubera, Murugan and Agastya. A city was found submerged in Pondicherry and according to the location, has been popularly credited as being the site for the first Sangam, Kapatapuram. A total of 4449 poets are described as having composed songs for this Sangam. There were 89 Pandiya kings starting from Kaysina valudi to Kadungon were decedents and rulers of that period.

It was said to be located in &quot;Then Madurai&quot; under the patronage of 89 Pandya kings. It is said to have lasted for 4,440 years, and this would put the First Sangam between 9600 BCE to 5200 BCE.

Some are of the opinion that Agathiyar was the head of the Head Sangam. However, this is unlikely as the first mention of him is from Ptolemy and no Sangam work refers to him. A more likely proposition is Lord Muruga (Kartikeya) being the head of the First Sangam as believed by others.

Its function was to judge literary works and credit their worth. Later literary works like Iraiyanar Akaporul mention that 549 poets were members of it including Shiva, Murugan, Kuperan and seven Pandya kings. And 16,149 authors attended the convocation. Its chief works were Perumparipadal, Mudukuruku, Mudunarai and Kalariyavirai. It used Agattiyam as its grammar. There are no surviving works from this period.

Muranjiyur Mudinagar, a member of the first Tamil Sangam, is believed to have been a king of the Nagas in Jaffna. Siddha medicine is said to have been practiced during the First Sangam, and people &quot;enjoyed mental and bodily health, respecting nature and living hygienically.&quot;

Iraiyanar Kalaviyal mentions that a King Kadungon was the last ruler during the Talaiccankam. He is not to be confused with Kadungon who defeated the Kalabhras. It was washed away in a sea-deluge. This led to the Middle Sangam.

==Second legendary sangam==
The Second Sangam (&quot;iṭaicaṅkam&quot;) is also known as the Middle Sangam (Tamil: இடை சங்கம்) and the Second Academy. It was convened in &quot;Kapatapuram&quot;. This Sangam lasted for 3700 years and had 59 members, with 3700 poets participating. There were 59 Pandiya kings starting from Vendercceliyan to Mudattirumaran were decedents and rulers of that period. This city was also submerged in sea. 

The primary factors leading to the formation of the Middle Sangam was mentioned by Iraiyanar, one of the authors of Kurunthogai, who mentions the kingdom of a King named Kandungon, the last ruler during the First Sangam. It was washed away in a sea-erosion. This led to the Second Sangam.

The second Sangam was convened in &quot;Kapatapuram&quot;. This Sangam lasted for 3700 years and had 59 members, with 1700 poets participating. There were 59 Pandiya kings starting from Vendercceliyan to Mudattirumaran were decedents and rulers of that period. This city was also submerged in sea. Ramayana and Arthashastra of Kautalya corroborates the existence of a city named Kavatapuram. There is a reference to a South Indian place called Kavata by Sugriva in a verse which runs something like &#x27;having reached Kavata suitable for Pandiya&#x27;. Kavata is also mentioned by Kautalya in Arthashastra. The grammar followed was Budapuranam, Agattiyam, Tholkappiyam, Mapuranam and Isai Nunukkam. The poems attributed to second academy are Kali, Kurugu, Vendali and Viyalamalai Ahaval. 

==Third legendary Sangam==
The third Sangam (&quot;kaṭaicaṅkam&quot;) was purportedly located in the current city of Madurai and lasted for 1850 years. There were 49 Pandiya kings starting from Mudattirumaran (who came away from Kabadapuram to present Madurai) to Ukkirapperu Valudi were decedents and rulers of that period. The academy had 49 members, and 449 poets are described as having participated in the Sangam.

The Third Sangam (&quot;kaṭaicaṅkam&quot;) was purportedly located in the current city of Madurai and lasted for 1850 years. There were 49 Pandiya kings starting from Mudattirumaran (who came away from Kabadapuram to present Madurai) to Ukkirapperu valudi were descendants and rulers of that gathering. The academy had 49 members, and 449 poets are described as having participated in the Sangam. The grammars followed were Agattiyam and Tholkappiyam. The poems composed were Kurunthogai, Netunthogai, Kurunthogai Nanooru, Narrinai Nanooru, Purananooru, Aingurunooru, Padirrupaatu, Kali, Paripaadal, Kuttu, Vari, Sirrisai and Perisai.

There are a number of other isolated references to the legend of academies at Madurai scattered through Shaivite and Vaishnavite devotional literature throughout later literature.

In Nambi&#x27;s account, the 49 members of the third Sangam led by Kapilar, Paraṇar and Nakkīrar were great devotees of Shiva, numbered amongst the 63 nayanars. Nakkirar himself is said to have later headed the Sangam, and to have debated Shiva. The Sangam is described as having been held on the banks of the Pond of Golden Lotuses in the Meenakshi-Sundaresvarar Temple in Madurai.

== Historicity ==
According to P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar who made research on this topic mentions in his book &quot;History of Tamils&quot; Chapter XVI on topic &quot;Criticism of the legend&quot;, as the years mentioned for the Three Tamil Sangams are too vast.

* The First Sangam lasted 4440 years and spanned 89 succeeding kings.
* The Second Sangam lasted 3700 years and spanned 59 succeeding kings.
* The Third Sangam lasted 1800 years and spanned 49 succeeding kings.

According to Kamil Zvelebil, the assemblies may have been founded and patronised by the Pandian kings and functioning in three different capitals consecutively till the last sangam was set up in Madurai. Zvelebil argues that the appearance of the tradition in literary and epigraphical sources means that it cannot be dismissed as pure fiction. He suggests that the Sangam legends are based on a historical &quot;body of scholiasts and grammarians &#x27;sits&#x27; as a norm-giving, critical college of literary experts, and shifts its seat according to the geopolitical conditions of the Pandiyan kingdom.&quot;

In 470 CE, a Dravida Sangha was established in Madurai by a Jain named Vajranandi. During that time the Tamil region was ruled by the Kalabhras dynasty. The Kalabhra rulers were followers of either Buddhism or Jainism. The &quot;Dravida Sangha&quot; took much interest in the Tamil language and literature. George L. Hart suggests that later legends about Tamil Sangams may have been based on the Jaina assembly.

<text>A terrestrial network (or broadcast network in the United States) is a group of radio stations, television stations, or other electronic media outlets, that form an agreement to air, or broadcast, content from a centralized source. For example, and (U.S.), (Canada), the BBC (UK), the (Australia), ARD (Germany), (Philippines), (South Korea), and NHK (Japan) are TV networks that provide programming for local terrestrial television station affiliates to air using signals that can be picked up by the home television sets of local viewers. Networks generally, but not always, operate on a national scale; that is, they cover an entire country.

Streaming media, Internet radio, and webcasting are sometimes considered forms of broadcasting despite the lack of terrestrial stations; its practitioners may also be called &quot;broadcasters&quot; or even &quot;broadcast networks&quot;. 

==American networks==
===AT&amp;T&#x27;s &quot;WEAF Chain&quot;===


Following the introduction of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) developed the first radio network, linking together individual stations with specially prepared long-distance telephone lines in what at the time was called a &quot;chain&quot;. The key station was AT&amp;T&#x27;s WEAF (now WFAN) in New York City. The network featured a variety of regularly scheduled programs which included sponsorships (at the time not called advertising but &quot;toll broadcasting&quot;).

From the beginning, AT&amp;T planned to eventually expand nationwide, so that national companies would be able reach large portions of the nation with their brand names and slogans in an efficient manner. At first the network&#x27;s expansion was slow. In 1924, the &quot;Eveready Hour&quot; was broadcast over 12 stations, primarily located in the U.S. Northeast. &quot;Eveready Hour&quot; was the first commercially sponsored variety show in the history of broadcasting. By 1925, AT&amp;T had linked together 26 stations in its network.

AT&amp;T eventually decided to concentrate on its most profitable business, telephones, and in 1926 sold its broadcasting interests to the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). RCA&#x27;s purchase included an agreement to lease AT&amp;T phone lines.

===RCA&#x27;s &quot;WJZ Chain&quot;===
In 1922, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) followed AT&amp;T&#x27;s network model lead, and formed a small competing network centered on its New York City station, WJZ (now WABC). However, conflict resulted as RCA had a limited ability to lease lines from AT&amp;T and often had to use telegraph lines to connect stations, which had inferior acoustical properties.

===NBC===

After acquiring WEAF and AT&amp;T&#x27;s network assets in 1926, RCA created the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and reorganized the WEAF chain (with WGR, WTIC, WTAG, WEEI, WJAR, WZAN, WFI-WLIT, WCAE, WRC, WTAM, WSAI, WWJ, WGN, WOC, KSD, WDAF, WCCO) as the NBC Red network and the WJZ chain as the NBC Blue network (with WBZ, WBZA, KYW, KDKA). (One explanation for the color designations is that they reflected the red and blue push pins used on a map that AT&amp;T originally used to designate the affiliated stations on the two networks.)

On 23 December 1928, NBC instituted the first permanent transcontinental network. As of September 1938, when there were 154 NBC outlets; 23 composed the basic Red network and 24 composed the basic Blue network. Supplementing these basic networks were 107 stations, of which one was available only to the basic Red network, six were available only to the basic Blue network, and the remainder available to either. NBC also had a chain of shortwave stations, called the &quot;NBC White Network&quot;, in the 1930s.

In 1941, the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC) &quot;Report on Chain Broadcasting&quot; reviewed the alleged monopolistic practices of the radio networks. The FCC was concerned NBC Red and NBC Blue were anti-competitive. Because the FCC did not have the power to directly regulate networks, it decided to enact regulations affecting the stations, and adopted standards intended to force NBC to relinquish one of its networks. In 1943, the Supreme Court upheld the FCC&#x27;s power to enforce its chain broadcasting regulations. As a consequence, NBC Blue was sold to Edward Noble who later named it the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). After NBC Blue was divested the remaining NBC Red network was renamed the NBC Radio Network.

===CBS===

In 1927, United Independent Broadcasters, Inc., supported by the Columbia Phonograph Record Company, started a new network of 16 stations (WOR New York, WFBL Syracuse, WMAK Buffalo-Lockport, WNAC Boston, WEAN Providence, WCAU Philadelphia, WJAS Pittsburgh, WCAO Baltimore, WADC Akron, WAIU Columbus, WKRC Cincinnati, WGHP Detroit, WOWO Fort Wayne, WMAQ Chicago, KMOX St. Louis, KOIL Council Bluffs) named the &quot;Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System&quot;.

In 1928, William S. Paley assumed control of the network, which under his leadership focused on entertainment programming, news, and news affiliation. He quickly turned the failing company around, which was named Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. (CBS) in 1929. By the end of 1938 there were 113 CBS outlets. Regional networks on CBS also existed in various parts of the country.

CBS later hired Edward R. Murrow who is credited with boosting ratings dramatically. Murrow and CBS covered the war in Europe while Adolf Hitler was in power. NBC and ABC withdrew from the war for safety reasons. As a result of taking the risk, CBS&#x27;s ratings skyrocketed.

===ABC===

In 1945, the NBC Blue network was sold to Edward John Noble, who later renamed it American Broadcasting Company (ABC). By the mid-1940s broadcasting had become a big Three television networks battle. ABC almost went bankrupt and in 1951 Leonard Goldenson and United Paramount Theaters bought the network for $25 million. In 1964, ABC won the ratings race in the 50 largest American markets. In the 1970–71 season, ABC ranked #1 in the Nielsen ratings with a medical drama called Marcus Welby, M.D., the first ABC television show to top the list.

===Mutual===

In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. In 1934 this was reorganized as the Mutual Broadcasting System. The network was organized with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows.

===Westwood One News===

Radio news network launched on January 1, 2015, and operated by Westwood One through its parent company Cumulus Media.

==Canadian national networks==
The first network in Canada was CNR Radio starting in 1923. The first regularly scheduled coast-to-coast network program produced by CN Radio was broadcast on 27 December 1928. By 1930, the network consisted of 27 stations.

Its assets were acquired by the government owned Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) in 1932.

<text>This is an article about literature in [[Quebec]].

== 16th and 17th centuries ==

During this period, the society of New France was being built with great difficulty. The French merchants contracted to transport colonists did not respect their end of the bargain, and the French and their Indian allies were at war with the Iroquois, allied to the English until 1701, etc. To add to these difficulties, the printing press was officially forbidden in Canada until the British Conquest.

In spite of this, some notable documents were produced in the early days of colonization and were passed down from generation to generation until today. The &quot;Voyage&quot; of Jacques Cartier, the &quot;Muses de la Nouvelle-France&quot; of Marc Lescarbot, the &quot;Voyages&quot; of Samuel de Champlain are memories of the exploration of North America and the foundation of New France.

The &quot;Relations des jésuites&quot;, &quot;Le Grand voyage au pays des Hurons&quot; of Gabriel Sagard, the &quot;Écrits&quot; of Marguerite Bourgeois were written by the many religious founders of New France who had undertaken the task of converting the &quot;Sauvages&quot; to Christianity.

Many songs and poems were transmitted orally by the early French settlers. A popular French ballad, &quot;À la claire fontaine&quot; was adapted by the voyageurs and gave us the version that is known today in Quebec.

The first patriotic song of Quebec (then known as &quot;le Canada&quot;) was written by a soldier, François Mariauchau d&#x27;Esgly. Entitled &quot;C&#x27;est le Général de Flip&quot;, it paid tribute to the resistance of the French at Quebec during the siege of General William Phips in 1690.

In France, Canada and New France in general caught the interest of many writers, notably François Rabelais who refers to Cartier and Roberval in Pantagruel.

== 18th century ==

Until 1760, the themes of nature, explorations, and the &quot;Sauvages&quot; continued to mark the imagination of the civilization of New France. The &quot;Moeurs des sauvages américains&quot; of Joseph-François Lafitau, &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;Amérique septentrionale&quot; of Bacqueville de la Potherie and the &quot;Histoire et description générale de la Nouvelle-France&quot; are in continuity with the writings of the preceding century.

The first verified use of the term &quot;Canadien&quot; to designate the descendants of French settlers in Canada was written in a song composed in 1756 in honour of Governor Vaudreuil after the military victory of Fort Chouaguen. In 1758, Étienne Marchand wrote a famous poem in &quot;Le carillon de la Nouvelle-France&quot;. This song tells the story of the victorious battle of Fort Carillon.

The first poem written by a &quot;Canadien&quot; after the cession of Canada to Great Britain is &quot;Quand Georges trois pris l&#x27;Canada&quot; written by an anonymous author in 1763.

The &quot;Quebec Gazette&quot; newspaper was founded in Quebec City by William Brown on June 21, 1764. The bilingual paper was published in both the French language and the English language and over the years survived to be the oldest newspaper still publishing in North America.

The literary trends of Europe and the rest of America slowly penetrated the cities, primarily Quebec City and Montreal. The writings of the Enlightenment and those produced at the time of the American and French revolutions were dominant in the available literature.

Valentin Jautard and Fleury Mesplet published the first journal of Quebec, the &quot;Gazette du commerce et littéraire&quot;, in 1778–79. Valentin Jautard, a disciple of Voltaire and sympathizer with the American cause, published many poems under different pseudonyms.

Some notable names of the time are Joseph-Octave Plessis, Ross Cuthbert, Joseph Quesnel and Pierre de Sales Laterrière.

In France, Voltaire wrote &quot;L&#x27;Ingénu&quot;, the tale of a Huron who visits France and also Chateaubriand, a French noble exiled in America, wrote Atala and René.

== 19th century ==

The 19th century marks the beginning of the first real literary works published by Quebecers, including Michel Bibaud, Pierre Boucher de Boucherville, François Réal Angers, Philippe-Ignace François Aubert de Gaspé, Amédée Papineau, Joseph Doutre, François-Xavier Garneau, Pierre Jean Olivier Chauveau, Louis-Antoine Dessaulles, H.-Émile Chevalier.

By the 1860s, Quebec authors were able to acquire a certain autonomy, as it became easier to publish a book and mass-produce it.

Antoine Gérin-Lajoie, Philippe-Joseph Aubert de Gaspé, Louis Fréchette, Arthur Buies, William Kirby, Honoré Beaugrand, Laure Conan, Edith Maude Eaton, William Chapman, Jules-Paul Tardivel, Winnifred Eaton, Pamphile Lemay were some of the key writers in this era.

An anonymous song, &quot;Les Raftsmen&quot;, became popular at the beginning of this century.

== 1900-1950 ==
Émile Nelligan, a follower of Symbolism, published his first poems in Montreal at the age of 16 but within five years he was diagnosed with Dementia praecox and confined to a lunatic asylum, after which he did not write any more works. His collected poems were published to great acclaim in 1903, though he may not have been aware of it, remaining institutionalized until his death in 1941. Among his most celebrated poems is &quot;Le Vaisseau d&#x27;Or&quot;. A biographical film about his life, entitled &quot;Nelligan&quot;, was released in 1991.

Louis Hémon, a native of France who moved to Canada in 1911, wrote the famous rural Quebec romance novel &quot;Maria Chapdelaine&quot; (1913) while working at a farm in the Lac Saint-Jean region. The title character would go on to become a key figure in Quebec&#x27;s national identity. Hémon did not live to see the book&#x27;s widespread publication, as he died after being hit by a train in Chapleau, Ontario. The novel has been widely published in many languages and film adaptations were made in 1934, 1950, 1983 and 2021.

Roman Catholic priest, historian, and Quebec nationalist Lionel Groulx wrote many works including the 1922 novel &quot;L&#x27;Appel de la race&quot; and the 1951 historical study &quot;Histoire du Canada français.&quot; His conservative ideology of clerico-nationalism would have a major influence on Quebec society into the 1950s.

Claude-Henri Grignon wrote the early modernist novel &quot;Un Homme et son péché&quot; (1933), which satirized life in rural Quebec, breaking with Quebec&#x27;s literary conventions of the time. The book has been adapted for the screen on several occasions, most notably the 2002 film Séraphin: Heart of Stone.

Priest and folklorist Félix-Antoine Savard won acclaim and a medal from the for the 1937 novel &quot;Menaud, maître draveur&quot;, set in the mountains of rural Charlevoix.

Under the pseudonym of &#x27;Ringuet&#x27;, physician and academic Philippe Panneton published &quot;Trente arpents&quot; (1938), the famous novel about the transition from agrarian to urban life in Quebec. The book won the 1940 Governor General&#x27;s Award for fiction, among other prizes. Panneton would later become ambassador to Portugal.

Germaine Guèvremont wrote popular novels in the traditional &quot;roman du terroir&quot; style, such as 1945&#x27;s &quot;Le Survenant&quot; and its 1947 sequel &quot;Marie-Didace.&quot; Roger Lemelin&#x27;s classic novel of Quebec domestic life, &quot;Les Plouffe&quot;, was published in 1948.

In literature, the renovation during the 1930s is above all attached to the work by Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau which will explore the inner reality (&quot;Poésies&quot;) and the formal limits of writing in general (&quot;Œuvres en prose&quot;, &quot;Journal 1929-1939&quot;). In 1937, this writer published &quot;Regards et Jeux dans l&#x27;espace&quot;: this important book of Quebec poetry will have a deep impact on the future of the Quebec poetry, and its literature in general. Several critics and historians of literature consider that the publication of &quot;Regards et jeux dans l&#x27;espace&quot;, in 1937, marks the beginning of modern literature in Quebec. The main writers who will succeed to de Saint-Denys Garneau during the 1940s oscillated between the experience of loneliness and impulsive individual revolt.

In the first half of the 20th century, some writers provoked the ire of the powerful Roman Catholic church in the province. The publication of Jean-Charles Harvey&#x27;s 1934 novel &quot;Les Demi-civilisés&quot; was considered scandalous. He was fired from his job as a journalist and the book was banned by authorities. Abstract artist Paul-Émile Borduas, a founding figure of the Automatiste movement, wrote the manifesto &quot;Refus Global&quot; (1948), advocating the separation of church and state in Quebec, for which he was ostracized by the establishment of the time and dismissed from his teaching position.

Manitoba-born writer Gabrielle Roy&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Bonheur d&#x27;occasion&quot; (1945), considered a classic of Canadian literature, described the conditions of life in Montreal&#x27;s working-class Saint-Henri neighbourhood. After being published in English as &quot;The Tin Flute&quot; (1947), the book would win the 1947 Governor General&#x27;s Award for fiction and sell more than three-quarters of a million copies in the United States. She won further acclaim for the dark, emotional novel &quot;Alexandre Chenevert&quot; (1954) and won a third Governor General&#x27;s Award for &quot;Ces enfants de ma vie&quot; (1977).

== 1950-2000 ==
Several important literary figures emerged from the Montreal Jewish community in the mid-20th century. A. M. Klein found great success in 1948 with &quot;The Rocking Chair and Other Poems&quot;, which won a Governor General&#x27;s Award for poetry and sold in unexpectedly large numbers. He published his only novel, &quot;The Second Scroll&quot;, in 1951. Klein would come to be recognized as &#x27;one of Canada&#x27;s greatest poets and a leading figure in Jewish-Canadian culture&#x27;.

Mordecai Richler&#x27;s fourth novel &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;, set like much of his work in the largely Jewish Saint Urbain Street district of Montreal, was published in 1959 to great acclaim. This novel, &quot;Joshua Then and Now&quot; (1980) and &quot;Barney&#x27;s Version&quot; (1997) would all be made into major feature films, while &quot;St. Urbain&#x27;s Horseman&quot; (1971) and &quot;Solomon Gursky Was Here&quot; (1989) were shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Richler&#x27;s satirical 1992 book &quot;Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!&quot; stirred controversy by lampooning Quebec&#x27;s language laws restricting the use of English, leading to criticism by Quebec nationalists.

The outspoken, flamboyant poet Irving Layton rose to national prominence with 1959&#x27;s &quot;A Red Carpet for the Sun&quot;, which won the Governor General&#x27;s Award. Leonard Cohen published the poetry collections &quot;Let Us Compare Mythologies&quot; (1956), &quot;The Spice-Box of Earth&quot; (1961) and &quot;Flowers for Hitler&quot; (1964) and the novels &quot;The Favourite Game&quot; (1963) and &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; (1966) before going on to achieve international stardom as a musician. Louis Dudek published dozens of volumes of poems including &quot;Europe&quot; (1954), &quot;The Transparent Sea&quot; (1956), &quot;En Mexico&quot; (1958) and &quot;Atlantis&quot; (1967). He was invested as a member of the Order of Canada in 1984 as &#x27;one of Canada&#x27;s leading poets&#x27;.

Quebec City author Yves Thériault found success with his sixth novel &quot;Agaguk&quot; (1958), which dealt with cultural conflicts between Inuit and white men. This book sold 300,000 copies and was translated into seven languages. His next novel &quot;Ashini&quot; (1961) won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for French Language Fiction.

Author and poet Anne Hébert&#x27;s first novel &quot;Les Chambres de bois&quot; was released in 1958 and she would later write such award-winning works as &quot;Kamouraska&quot; (1970) and &quot;Les fous de Bassan&quot; (1982), both of which would be adapted into films. Her novels &quot;Les enfants du sabbat&quot; (1975) and &quot;L&#x27;enfant chargé des songes&quot; (1992) both won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for fiction, and &quot;Poèmes&quot; won the award for poetry in 1960.

Marie-Claire Blais published her first novel &quot;La Belle Bête&quot; at the age of 20 in 1959 and would go on to write over 20 novels as well as plays, poetry and newspaper articles. She won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for French-language fiction a record four times, for 1968&#x27;s &quot;Manuscrits de Pauline Archange&quot;, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Le sourd dans la ville&quot;, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Soifs&quot; and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Naissance de Rebecca à l’ère des tourments&quot;.

Numerous impactful writers were associated with Quebec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution period beginning in the 1960s. Poet Gaston Miron is considered the most important literary figure of Quebec&#x27;s nationalist movement. His poetry collection &quot;L&#x27;homme rapaillé&quot; was an instant success upon its publication in 1970 and remains among the most widely read texts in the Quebecois literary canon. Hubert Aquin&#x27;s first novel &quot;Prochain épisode&quot; (1965), written while the author was detained in a psychiatric institution, is considered a classic of Canadian literature and was the winning title in the 2003 edition of CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot; competition. Aquin would write five more novels before taking his own life in 1977. Prolific author Victor-Lévy Beaulieu, a fierce opponent of bilingualism in Quebec, wrote many novels beginning with 1968&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;outre-tonneau&quot; and most notably 1974&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Don Quichotte de la démanche&quot;. Pierre Vallières, an intellectual leader of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ), wrote the controversial 1968 book &quot;Nègres blancs d&#x27;Amérique&quot; while incarcerated in an American prison, awaiting extradition back to Canada.

Atheist writer Gérard Bessette won acclaim for the 1960 existential tale &quot;Le libraire&quot; and won Governor General&#x27;s Awards for &quot;L&#x27;incubation&quot; (1965) and &quot;Le cycle&quot; (1971).

Physician Jacques Ferron published his first book &quot;L&#x27;ogre&quot; in 1949 and received the 1962 Governor General&#x27;s Award for French fiction for his novel &quot;Contes du pays incertain&quot;. In 1977 he was honoured by the Quebec government with the Prix Athanase-David.

In 1964 Jacques Renaud published the violent novella &quot;Le Cassé&quot;, now considered a classic of Quebec literature. This was among the first works to incorporate the joual French dialect of working-class Montreal. His novel &quot;En d&#x27;autres paysages&quot; (1970) was influenced by magical realism.

Réjean Ducharme&#x27;s 1966 debut novel &quot;L&#x27;Avalée des avalés&quot; was short-listed for the Prix Goncourt and later won the 2005 French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;. He would win Governor General&#x27;s Awards for that novel as well as 1973&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;hiver de force&quot;, a Beat Generation-influenced tale of bohemian life in Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, and the 1982 play &quot;Ha ha!&quot;

Michel Tremblay&#x27;s first professionally produced play &quot;Les Belles-sœurs&quot;, written in 1965, set off a storm of controversy after its 1968 premiere for its use of joual street language and realistic portrayal of the lives of working-class Quebecois. The play would go on to have a profound effect on Quebec culture, and has been translated into more than thirty languages.

Haitian-Canadian author Dany Laferrière&#x27;s 1985 debut novel &quot;Comment faire l&#x27;amour avec un nègre sans se fatiguer&quot; was adapted into a controversial 1989 film of the same name. Laferrière&#x27;s novels &quot;Le Goût des jeunes filles&quot; and &quot;Vers le sud&quot; were also made into feature films, and he won the Prix Médicis for 2009&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;énigme du retour&quot;.

Poet and novelist Élise Turcotte won the Prix Émile-Nelligan award for poetry for &quot;La voix de Carla&quot; in 1987 and for &quot;La terre est ici&quot; in 1989. Her 2003 novel &quot;La maison étrangère&quot; won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for French-language fiction.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-3008&quot; was a Type XXI U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; that served in the United States Navy for several years after World War II.

Her keel was laid down on 2 July 1944 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen, and she was commissioned on 19 October 1944 with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Fokko Schlömer in command. In March 1945 Schlömer was relieved by &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Helmut Manseck who commanded the boat until Nazi Germany&#x27;s surrender on 8 May.

==Design==
Like all Type XXI U-boats, &quot;U-3008&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of (o/a), a beam of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN SE supercharged six-cylinder M6V40/46KBB diesel engines each providing , two Siemens-Schuckert GU365/30 double-acting electric motors each providing , and two Siemens-Schuckert silent running GV232/28 electric motors each providing .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When running on silent motors the boat could operate at a speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-3008&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes in the bow and four C/30 anti-aircraft guns. She could carry twenty-three torpedoes or seventeen torpedoes and twelve mines. The complement was five officers and fifty-two men.

==Service history==

===Kriegsmarine===
&quot;U-3008&quot; left Wilhelmshaven for patrol on 3 May 1945, but returned to port after the surrender. 
On 21 June 1945 U-3008 was part of a flotilla of six U-boats escorted by HMS Hargood from Wilhelmshaven to Lishally, Northern Ireland.
As U-3008 was an advanced design it was transferred to the United States in some secrecy, reaching New London, Connecticut, on 22 August.
===United States Navy===
On 13 September, she moved to the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, where she began an extensive overhaul the following day. Work proceeded on an intermittent basis due to the lack of final and total approval of the vessel&#x27;s allocation to the United States by the Allied powers concerned. However, by the spring of 1946, the naval shipyard received orders to proceed with the overhaul as expeditiously as possible and to place the submarine in service immediately upon its completion. &quot;U-3008&#x27;s&quot; overhaul was completed by mid-summer, and she was placed into active U.S. Navy service on 24 July 1946 with Commander Everett H. Steinmetz in charge.

&quot;U-3008&quot; was assigned initially to Submarine Squadron 2 and operated along the New England coast out of New London and Portsmouth. That duty continued until 31 March 1947, when she departed New London bound ultimately for Key West, Florida, and duty with the Operational Development Force. En route, the U-boat stopped off at Norfolk, Virginia, for three weeks of underway operations with Task Force 67. She continued south on 19 April and arrived at Key West on 23 April. There, she reported for duty with Submarine Squadron 4 and began working with the Operational Development Force. That duty involved the development of submarine and antisubmarine tactics and lasted until October 1947 when she returned to New London.

The U-boat conducted operations out of New London and Portsmouth between October 1947 and February 1948. On 28 February, she stood out of New London to return to Florida. She reached Key West on 5 March and resumed duty with the Operational Development Force. She remained so engaged until the end of the first week in June. On 7 June, she headed north once more and arrived in Portsmouth on 11 June. On 18 June 1948, &quot;U-3008&quot; was placed out of service at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in New Hampshire.

Though out of service, &quot;U-3008&quot; remained a Navy test hulk for several years. She was scuttled in a series of demolition tests in 1954. The hulk was raised and towed to the Navy drydock at Roosevelt Roads where she was offered up for sale in 1955. She was sold to Loudes Iron &amp; Metal Company on 15 September 1955, and the purchaser took possession of her on 17 January 1956. She was subsequently scrapped.

<text>Tihomir Blaškić (born 2 November 1960) is a retired general of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), and war criminal who served during the Bosnian War and the Croat–Bosniak War. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted him on war crimes charges and in 2000 he was sentenced to 45 years of prison. In July 2004, the ICTY, on appeal, determined that his command responsibility for most of the charges was non-existent and his sentence was lessened to nine years imprisonment. He was released the following month.

==Early life==
Tihomir Blaškić was born on 2 November 1960 in the village of Brestovsko in the Kiseljak municipality of Bosnia-Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia. He was a career military officer and graduated from the Belgrade Military Academy in 1983, having previously been a captain in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA).

During the period referred to in the indictment, he held the rank of colonel in the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the official military formation of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia. From 27 June 1992, Blaškić was Commander of the Regional Headquarters of the Armed Forces in central Bosnia. Subsequently, in August 1994, he was promoted to the rank of general and appointed Commander of the HVO, which had its headquarters in Mostar. In November 1995, he was given the post of inspector in the General Inspectorate of the Army of the Republic of Croatia.

==Bosnian War==

Following international recognition of Bosnia on 6 April 1992, armed conflict erupted between the different communities. As a result, on 8 April 1992, the Bosnian Croats created the HVO, backed by the Croatian Army (HV). The zones which they had control over were contained within the Croatian Community of Bosnia-Herzegovina (HZBH). Blaškić was in command of the HVO troops in the Lašva Valley in central Bosnia, which was inhabited, in the majority, by Muslims and Croats. Between May 1992 and January 1993, relations between the two communities became increasingly strained. 

This peace plan gave definition to a decentralised Bosnia-Herzegovina, organised into ten provinces, each benefiting from substantial autonomy and each being administered by a democratically elected local government. Under this plan, the Lašva Valley was attached, for the greater part, to a province where the principal responsibilities were attributed to the Croats. Muslims wanted Croatian territories as satisfaction for territories lost from Serbs. The Croats are expelled from Travnik, Bugojno, Kakanj, Vareš, Konjic, Fojnica etc.

==War crimes==
In 1996 the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Blaškić for crimes committed by troops under his command against Bosniaks in central Bosnia, particularly the Lašva Valley, including grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity.

In reaction, Franjo Tuđman named Blaškić Inspector General of the Croatian Army. Later in the year, Blaškić was told by his military superiors that it was his duty to voluntarily surrender and he reluctantly did so; his trial began in 1997. 

On 3 March 2000, The First Trial Chamber of the ICTY handed down its verdict, which condemned Blaškić to 45 years in prison. The First Trial Chamber charged Blaškić, based on his individual personal responsibility (Art. 7 § 1 ICTY Statute) and on his responsibility as hierarchical superior (Art. 7 § 3 ICTY Statute), on the following counts:
* serious breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Art. 2 ICTY Statute: wilful murder, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; widespread destruction of property; inhumane treatment, taking of civilian hostages);
* violations of the laws and customs of war (Art. 3 ICTY Statute: devastation not justified by military necessity; illegal attacks on civilians; illegal attacks on civilian property, murder; infliction of grievous bodily harm; looting of public or private property; destruction or wilful damage to institutions dedicated to religion or education; cruel treatment; hostage taking;
* crimes against humanity (Art. 5 ICTY Statutes: persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds; murder; inhumane acts).

The case was in appeal until July 2004 when the ICTY appeals panel dismissed 16 of 19 counts in the initial indictment, notably the claim that Blaškić had command responsibility for the massacre in Ahmići and that Ahmići was not a legitimate military target. The decision did not assess the nature of Croat-Muslim war in Bosnia in 1993–94; it accepted the defense claim that there existed a &quot;double chain of command&quot;. The appeals panel reaffirmed less serious charges, including responsibility for the inhumane treatment of POWs. It reduced Blaškić&#x27;s prison sentence to nine years, purportedly due to his good behavior, clear prior record, poor health, voluntary surrender and his young children.

His defense applied for an early release as he had served eight years and four months already; the request was granted on 29 July 2004 (see ICTY, &#x27;Tihomir Blaškić Granted Early Release&#x27;, Press Release, 29 July 2004). 

Exactly one year later, ICTY prosecutor Carla Del Ponte filed a motion for new trial, citing new evidence. The Appeals Chamber dismissed this motion on 23 November 2006.

<doc id="406500" wikidata="Q297318" url="?curid=406500" title="Ante Gotovina">
<text>Ante Gotovina (born 12 October 1955) is a Croatian retired lieutenant general and former French senior corporal who served in the Croatian War for Independence. He is noted for his primary role in the 1995 Operation Storm. In 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted him on war crimes and crimes against humanity charges in connection with that operation and its aftermath. After spending four years in hiding, he was captured in the Canary Islands in December 2005.

On 15 April 2011, Gotovina was found guilty on 8 of the 9 counts of the indictment and sentenced to 24 years of imprisonment. On 16 November 2012, Gotovina&#x27;s convictions were overturned by an appeals panel at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and he was released from custody.

==Early life==
Ante Gotovina was born in Tkon on the island of Pašman. His father Milan tried to move with his mother to Italy, but was caught by the Yugoslav border police. His mother was released while his father spent time in prison. When Gotovina was nearly four, his mother was killed saving him from an explosion at a construction site. Subsequently, his father went to work in Zagreb, while Gotovina and his siblings went to live with their maternal grandfather Šime in Pakoštane. Around Easter of 1971, Gotovina and his friend Srećko tried to escape by sailing away. Rough seas caused by a storm forced them back and they soon returned to Pakoštane. Gotovina kept his escape attempt from his family and continued to attend school for electrical engineering in Zadar.

==French Foreign Legion==
At the age of sixteen, Gotovina left home to become a sailor. In 1973, before turning eighteen, he joined the French Foreign Legion under the pseudonym of Andrija Grabovac and became a member of the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2e REP) after qualifying at the Training School in Pau before joining the elite &quot;Commandos de Recherche et d&#x27;Action en Profondeur&quot; (CRAP) now renamed as &quot;Parachute Commando Group&quot; (GCP). It was there he met Dominique Erulin, brother of the Colonel Philippe Erulin, who became his friend and partner in future missions. In the next few years, he participated in Foreign Legion operations in Djibouti, the Battle of Kolwezi in Zaire, and missions in the Ivory Coast, becoming Colonel Erulin&#x27;s driver. After five years of service, he left the Legion with the rank of &quot;caporal-chef&quot;; he obtained French citizenship in 1979.

== Life in France ==
He subsequently worked for a variety of French private security companies during the 1980s, among them KO International Company, a filial or subsidiary of VHP Security, known as a cover for the &quot;Service d&#x27;Action Civique&quot; (SAC), and was at this time responsible for the security of far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen. In 1981, together with Dominique Erulin, he helped editor Jean-Pierre Mouchard (a close friend of Jean-Marie Le Pen) organize a commando operation to free his press in La Seyne-sur-Mer, occupied by CGT trade-union strikers.

According to French police records, he became involved in criminal activities, which led to arrest warrants being issued for robbery and extortion; it has been reported that he served at least one two-year prison sentence, though this has been denied by his attorneys.

Towards the end of the decade he moved to South America, where he provided training to a number of right-wing paramilitary organizations, notably in Argentina and Guatemala. He met his first wife Ximena Dalel in Colombia, and they had a daughter.

Arrested during a trip to France, he was sentenced in 1986 to five years of prison by Paris&#x27; &quot;Cour d&#x27;assises&quot;. He was freed the next year, &quot;in circumstances showing that he was benefiting from very particular protections&quot;.

Dominique Erulin disputes the verdict against Gotovina and himself and claims Gotovina&#x27;s criminal record was manufactured by left-wing factions allied with President François Mitterrand. Gotovina&#x27;s lawyers submitted a brief to the International War Crimes Tribunal alleging that Gotovina was framed by an alleged criminal police group loyal to François Mitterrand.

==Croatian War of Independence==
Gotovina returned to Croatia in 1991 at the dawn of Croatian War of Independence and enlisted in the Croatian National Guard (ZNG), the first organized military body of what would become the Croatian Army. He was an efficient commander and had the advantage – shared by relatively few other Croatian soldiers – of combat experience. He fought in western Slavonia: in Novska and Nova Gradiška, attached to the 1st Guards Brigade. He soon caught the attention of his superiors, and when the Croatian Army was established as such in 1992, Gotovina was promoted to colonel. As a colonel he was one of the main organizers of Operation Maslenica, which restored Croatia&#x27;s territorial continuity in Dalmatia.

By 1994 he had risen to the rank of major-general and, as a &quot;general-pukovnik&quot; and commanding officer of the Split military district he organized key military operations: the defense of Livno and Tomislavgrad from the troops of Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladić, and the ten-month war of attrition which broke the Serb defenses in the Plain of Livno, the Dinara Ridge and the Šator mountain. He led the conquest of Glamoč and Bosansko Grahovo (Operation Summer &#x27;95), which enabled him to close from the east the encirclement of Knin, the capital of the self-declared (1991–95) Republic of Serbian Krajina. This ensured conditions for the rapid success of Operation &quot;Oluja&quot; (&quot;Storm&quot;) in 4–6 August 1995, during which forces under his command captured Knin.

Gotovina was then immediately put in charge of the combined forces of the Croatian Army (&quot;Hrvatska Vojska&quot; or HV) and the Croatian Defense Council in Bosnia (&quot;Hrvatsko Vijeće Obrane&quot; or HVO) in Operation Mistral 2, which defeated the army of the Bosnian Serbs and led the Croatian army, together with the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, within 23 kilometres of Banja Luka and was only stopped under American pressure.

==Post-war period==
In 1996, he became the chief of the Army Inspectorate. In September 2000, he was a signatory to the Twelve Generals&#x27; Letter in which the government of Ivica Račan was criticised. Among the other generals, he was forced to retire by president Stjepan Mesić, with an explanation that military officers shouldn&#x27;t write political letters if not approved by the supreme commander and the president, respectively.

==War crimes indictment==
===Flight and attendant political controversies===
In July 2001, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) issued sealed indictments to the Croatian government seeking the arrest of Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač for war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed between 4 August 1995 and 15 November 1995. Gotovina was indicted together with Markač, a former commander of the special police of Croatia&#x27;s interior ministry, and Ivan Čermak, assistant defense minister from 1991 to 1993. The three were accused of &quot;aiding and abetting the murders of 324 Krajina Serb civilians and prisoners of war by shooting, burning and/or stabbing&quot; them and &quot;forcibly displacing almost 90,000 Serb civilians&quot;. Gotovina was charged with five counts of crimes against humanity (persecutions, deportation, inhumane acts, murder) and four counts of violations of the laws or customs of war (plunder, wanton destruction, murder, cruel treatment). He denied all charges.

For four years, 2001–2005, Gotovina remained at large despite intense pressure from the United States and the European Union for his surrender. Foreign countries sought to hunt down Gotovina, and an Interpol warrant was issued for his arrest. The United States announced a $5 million (€4.2 million) reward for his capture. The British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) was reported in Croatian media in 2004 to have been allowed to import sophisticated monitoring equipment to track down Gotovina. This caused resentment among elements of Croatia&#x27;s security establishment; as a result, MI6 officers based in Croatia under cover were exposed in the Croatian media, allegedly at the behest of Gotovina&#x27;s sympathisers in Croatia&#x27;s counter-intelligence service, the POA (&quot;Protuobavještajna agencija&quot;). Prior to that, a number of Croatian security officials were sacked, including POA head Franjo Turek, who was replaced by Joško Podbevšek and shortly afterwards by Tomislav Karamarko. The wiretapping operation went ahead after Turek&#x27;s retirement in March 2004, under his successor at the POA, but failed to locate Gotovina before a deadline set by the Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader in June 2004. According to a leaked memo from MI6 to the POA, the UK government had called for Turek&#x27;s arrest, unless he started to cooperate on Gotovina.

Several EU member states, including the UK and the Netherlands, made the surrender of Gotovina a precondition for Croatia&#x27;s accession to the European Union. This stance was criticised by the Croatian government, which claimed ignorance of Gotovina&#x27;s whereabouts but that he was probably outside the country and that it was doing all it could to bring him to justice. Accession negotiations with the EU, scheduled to start on 17 March 2005, were postponed pending a resolution of the issue.

In September 2005, ICTY&#x27;s chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte claimed she had information that he was hiding in a Franciscan monastery in Croatia or in Bosnian Croat territory. She went to the Vatican to ask for help in locating him, but told The Daily Telegraph that the Vatican Secretary for Relations with States, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo, had refused to help, telling her that the Vatican was not a state and thus had &quot;no international obligations&quot;. Her comments infuriated the Church in Croatia as well as the Vatican, whose spokesman Joaquín Navarro-Valls said the archbishop asked Del Ponte what evidence she had for her claims but which she reportedly did not provide.

===Capture and extradition===
On 7 December 2005, Gotovina was captured by Spanish police and special forces in the resort of Playa de las Américas on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. He was reported to have been traveling on two fake Croatian passports using the names, Goran Drozdek and Stjepan Seničić. His passport contained border stamps of several countries, including Argentina, Chile, Russia, China, Czech Republic and Tahiti. A sum of money amounting to €12,000 was discovered in his room. He was immediately flown to Madrid, where he was imprisoned in advance of a court hearing to extradite him to the ICTY prison at The Hague. Spanish police were later reported to have been tracking him for several days, apparently following a lead obtained through the wiretapping of his wife Dunja&#x27;s phone.

The involvement of Croatian authorities was backed up by the Carla&#x27;s List documentary, a part of which is available on YouTube. Croatian media credited Josip Buljević (subsequently the SOA&#x27;s director, later president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović&#x27;s national security advisor and since January 2016 defence minister) with being in charge of the operation to locate and arrest Gotovina.

On 10 December 2005, Gotovina was flown to The Hague, where he appeared before the ICTY on 12 December. He pleaded not guilty to the seven charges brought against him, for acting individually and/or through a joint criminal enterprise in persecutions, deportation and forced displacement and other inhumane acts for a total of four counts of crimes against humanity; and murder, plunder of property and wanton destruction of settlements in three counts of violations of the laws or customs of war. According to his lawyer, Gotovina has declared that he is &quot;not the man described in each and every count.&quot;

===Reactions===

Many Croats continued to regard Gotovina as a war hero and rejected the assertion that he was guilty of crimes. Major parties in Croatia were reported to be using Gotovina as a means of drumming up political support in the run-up to the 2007 parliamentary election.

During his flight, Gotovina became a prominent icon of Croatian popular culture. Marko Perković and Miroslav Škoro, two popular Croatian musicians, recorded songs with lyrics implicitly praising the general and his flight, and both songs became huge hits, especially among younger fans. In 2006, the two most popular football teams in the country, Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split, played a match, whose proceeds went to help finance the generals&#x27; legal fees.

In March 2005, a survey conducted on behalf of the U.S. Embassy in Croatia reported that a majority of those surveyed thought it was not in Croatia&#x27;s interest to extradite Gotovina. Unofficial polls by television programs also showed strong support, with most callers saying that they would prefer Gotovina remain at large even if it meant not joining the European Union.

In 2001 the Croatian writer Nenad Ivanković wrote a biography of Gotovina, &quot;Warrior-Adventurer and General (A Biography)&quot;. The Croatian filmmaker Dejan Šorak wrote and directed &quot;Two Players from the Bench&quot; (&quot;Dva igrača s klupe&quot;), a black comedy released in 2005 whose plot was inspired by the events surrounding the indictments against Gotovina. Jack Baric, an Emmy Award winning Croatian-American filmmaker made &quot;Searching for a Storm,&quot; a documentary film about Gotovina&#x27;s case and the war in Croatia. The film had its world premiere in 2009 at the Zagreb Dox Film Festival.

After Gotovina&#x27;s arrest in Spain, several rallies and protests took place in Croatian cities. On 11 December 2005 (the first Sunday after his arrest), a rally organised by war veterans attracted between 40,000 and 70,000 Croatians in the city of Split to protest the arrest. Several retired generals attended the rally and expressed their support for Gotovina. On the same day, rallies were held in several other cities in Croatia, but with smaller attendance (in Zagreb some 500 people gathered).

Polls taken by the PULS Agency after Gotovina&#x27;s arrest showed that almost two-thirds of the Croatian public found the accusations baseless.

==Trial==

At the end of 2006, Gotovina&#x27;s case was combined with cases of Ivan Čermak and Mladen Markač, as they all relate to Operation Storm. The Trial of Gotovina et al was expected to begin in May 2007 but was postponed indefinitely because of conflicts between lawyers on the defence bench. His lawyers were Luka Misetic, an American attorney of Croatian descent, Greg Kehoe, an American lawyer who advised the prosecution in the Iraqi Special Tribunal case against Saddam Hussein, and Payam Akhavan, former Legal Advisor to the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of the ICTY.

After the 2006 death of Slobodan Milošević, Gotovina signed a condolence note to his family (together with Mladen Naletilić Tuta, Ivica Rajić and other Croat and Serb detainees, making the list 34 signatures long), which was published in Belgrade&#x27;s &quot;Politika&quot; and &quot;Večernje novosti&quot; newspapers. Gotovina&#x27;s attorney stated that he signed because of his Catholic faith, which stresses forgiveness.

The trial began on 11 March 2008, and it concluded in September 2010 with the delivery of closing arguments. Misetic said that he expected a verdict in two to 10 months&#x27; time, as had been the case with the tribunal&#x27;s decisions to date.

===First-degree verdict===
On 15 April 2011, Gotovina was found guilty on 8 of the 9 counts of the indictment and sentenced to 24 years of imprisonment.

He was convicted of &quot;committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, deportation, persecution and inhuman acts&quot; and Presiding Judge Alphons Orie cited several witness testimonies in the decision.

In the Gotovina Defence Final Trial Brief, a 315-page document, Gotovina&#x27;s lawyers rejected the accusation of mass expulsion of Serbian population as well as the accusation of unlawful shelling of civilian areas, saying that the &quot;HV used artillery solely against military objectives in a highly professional operation consistent with well-established military doctrine&quot;.

In Zagreb, Croatia&#x27;s capital, thousands gathered to watch the sentence being given out live on large screens and loudly protested the decision. Croatian prime minister Jadranka Kosor stated the idea of a &quot;joint criminal enterprise&quot; was &quot;unacceptable&quot;. War veterans staged a march in the Croatian capital in protest. About 10,000 showed up to the march, chanting slogans against the Kosor-led government and the EU as protesters removed and ripped apart the EU flag from a flagpole at the main square, replacing it with the Croatian flag.

A poll conducted immediately after the verdict showed that 95.4% of Croatians felt the judgment against Gotovina was unjust and that 88% still saw him as a hero. Support for Croatia&#x27;s entry into the European Union plummeted to 23.8%. In June 2011, Gotovina was ranked the second most creditable person for the creation of an independent Croatian state in a poll conducted by &quot;Večernji list&quot;.

===Appeal verdict===
On 16 November 2012, Gotovina was found not guilty by three votes against two by the Appeals Panel of the ICTY, presided over by Theodor Meron. The previous verdict had sentenced him to 24 years in prison while Mladen Markač was sentenced to 18 years. Both of them were accused of being part of the &quot;criminal enterprise&quot; but the Court concluded there was no such conspiracy.

On 15 November, the night before the verdict, candle-lit vigils were held across Croatia, including at Catholic churches. Gotovina and Markač were supported by numerous Croatian veterans, and some marched from Zagreb&#x27;s Mirogoj cemetery to the Zagreb Cathedral.

Gotovina&#x27;s acquittal provoked mixed international reactions. Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanović reacted positively, as did the Croatian president Ivo Josipović.

Serbian President Tomislav Nikolić reacted negatively, as did Serbian government minister Rasim Ljajić and Prime Minister Ivica Dačić and much of the Serbian media.

The Serbian government froze its relations with the Tribunal. On the other hand, Veselin Šljivančanin congratulated the generals on their release and blamed the political leaders instead.

Reactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina were mixed: positive reactions came from the President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Živko Budimir and Croatian politician Dragan Čović, while the President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik responded negatively.

The case raised significant issues for law of war and it has been described as a precedent. Carla del Ponte, former Chief Prosecutor of ICTY, was described as shocked by the verdict. Ivan Šimonović, former Croatian minister of justice and current UN Assistant Secretary-General for human rights, said that the verdict would have an important role in interpretation of some regulations of international criminal law. Serbian politician Vuk Jeremić, President of the UN General Assembly, criticized the ICTY on Twitter. and in response scheduled a UN GA session to discuss the work of the ad-hoc Tribunals set up by UN.

==After release==

After the generals&#x27; release, the Croatian government dispatched the governmental Bombardier Challenger 600 plane along with the Minister of Defence, Ante Kotromanović, and the Minister of Veterans&#x27; Affairs, Predrag Matić, to bring Gotovina and Markač to Croatia. In Zagreb, they were greeted by Prime Minister Zoran Milanović and the Speaker of Parliament Josip Leko. Around 100,000 people heard them speak at the Ban Jelačić Square, after which Cardinal Josip Bozanić held a mass for them at the Zagreb Cathedral. The two generals were then received by the President at the Presidential Palace where Gotovina said that the &quot;Homeland War is now clean, it belongs to our history, it is a basis on which we build our future.&quot;

Matić said that Gotovina and Markač are amongst the candidates for a new highest Croatian decoration.

On 19 November 2012, the Belgrade-based tabloid &quot;Kurir&quot; ran an interview with Gotovina, who urged Serbs displaced after Operation Storm to return to Croatia.

On 23 November 2012, Gotovina became an honorary citizen of Split and the next day he became an honorary citizen of Zadar. On 2 December he was named honorary citizen of Osijek along with Markač.

In November 2012, Serbia&#x27;s government requested that the ICTY transfer the evidence against both generals to them for their own investigation. In January 2013, Serbia&#x27;s War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukčević said that the acquittal was final and a review of the case was impossible.

On 7 January 2014, it was announced that Gotovina had filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Treasury to lift economic sanctions imposed against him, which had been in place for more than a decade, listing Gotovina as a Specially Designated National in 2003, subject to economic sanctions. On 6 February, the Federal Register announced Gotovina&#x27;s removal from the list.

In 2019, &quot;The General&quot;, a biographical film about Gotovina&#x27;s life based on Nenad Ivanković&#x27;s book &quot;Warrior-Adventurer and General (A Biography)&quot; was released. It was directed by Antun Vrdoljak and starred Goran Višnjić as Gotovina.

<text>In philately, a cinderella stamp is a label that resembles a postage stamp, but which is not issued for postal purposes by a government administration. There is a wide variety of cinderella stamps, such as those printed for promotional use by businesses, churches, or political or non-profit groups. The term excludes imprinted stamps on postal stationery.

== Etymology ==
Named after Cinderella, a folk-tale underdog heroine who was treated as inferior within her family. Cinderella stamps similarly were considered inferior to postage stamps.

== Types ==
As cinderella stamps are defined by what they are not, there are many different types and the term is usually construed fairly loosely. Items normally regarded as falling within the area are poster stamps, propaganda labels, commemorative stickers, stamps issued by non-recognised countries or governments, charity labels like Christmas seals and Easter seals, most telegraph stamps, some railway stamps, some local stamps and purely decorative items created for advertising or amusement.

Revenue stamps may be considered cinderellas, but as they are normally issued by an official government agency, they tend to be classified separately. Some telegraph, railway and other stamps may also be issued by government agencies but still fall under the cinderella umbrella since they are not for postal purposes.

=== Local stamps ===

Local stamps have a long history and began to be issued soon after the invention of the postage stamp. Zemstvo stamps were issued in rural areas of the Russian Empire (c. 1860–1917), and local stamps have been issued in many other countries. Many local stamps, such as hotel stamps, performed a genuine postal function where the national post was lacking. Other locals, however, amount to nothing more than colourful labels.

In the United Kingdom many &quot;local carriage labels&quot; have been issued by offshore islands, which in some cases had a genuine use to pay for transport of the mail to the mainland by ferry. Others were produced simply to sell to collectors and tourists. Usually they had to be placed on the back of the envelope, with a conventional stamp on the front to pay for onward delivery by the official postal service. Islands for which such labels have been issued include the Summer Isles, Lundy, Eynhallow, and the Calf of Man.

=== Political and propaganda stamps ===
While it is common to find patriotic sentiments on official stamps, the term &quot;propaganda stamp&quot; is usually used to mean unofficial stamps produced to promote a particular ideology, or to create confusion within an enemy state. Stamps with encouraging slogans have been attached to letters for prisoners of war, or troops serving abroad.

Sometimes stamps are issued by breakaway governments, governments in exile, or micronations in order to give themselves greater legitimacy; however, these stamps usually have no postal validity and are therefore cinderella items. The &quot;Indian National Army&quot; (Azad Hind) produced ten stamps as part of their campaign.

From 1951 to 1966, UNESCO issued a series of 41 &quot;gift stamps&quot;. Considered to be cinderellas, they were produced to raise money for the organization. The series is unusual in being an international cooperative effort. Most are readily available from specialized dealers.

Illustrator and anarchist Clifford Harper, whose family had an occupational history in the postal service, designed stamps &quot;for post-revolutionary post&quot; bearing the image of anarchist figures such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (&quot;property is theft&quot;), Oscar Wilde, Emma Goldman and Emiliano Zapata. Colin Ward, along with Harper, published a book in 1997 called &quot;Stamps: Designs For Anarchist Postage Stamps&quot;, containing an essay by Ward on the subject of anarchists and postage stamps. Fund-raising stamps with anti-state messages have appeared within labor unions such as the ones printed by the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo, and the Industrial Workers of the World.

The Jewish National Fund had been publishing its own stamps since 1901, promoting the ideology of Zionism.

=== Non-official railway stamps ===

In the United Kingdom, the &quot;railway letter service&quot;, a special facility offered by most British railway companies since 1891, produced a great variety of stamps and labels, which were originally an official requirement of the service. Current officially licensed Heritage railway-operated services include the Festiniog Railway Letter Service. United Kingdom railway letter stamps almost always specify a fee (often, even in Victorian times, priced higher than the current postage fee, which additionally had to be paid with regular postage stamps) for the use of this official and once-important British postal facility.

== Design ==
The design of cinderella items generally follows the principles of postage stamp design, but they may lack a country name, often replaced by the organization or cause being promoted, or a denomination. Sometimes a fictitious country or denomination may be present.

== Collecting ==
While many cinderella stamps are common, others were privately produced in limited numbers, are little-known, and can be quite rare. Cinderella stamps are not normally listed in the main stamp-collecting catalogues; if they are, it is usually in a separate appendix within the publication, and so they are sometimes called &quot;back of the book&quot; stamps.
Online catalogues include cinderella stamps and usually have them listed as one of the emission types.

Revenue stamps are a recognised competitive category within the FIP (Fédération Internationale de Philatélie) and have their own commissioner, unlike other types of cinderella stamps.

There are cinderella stamp clubs in the United Kingdom and in Australia, both of which accept members worldwide.
Cinderella philately has a specific name in many countries, such as &quot;Erinnophilie&quot; in France and Germany, or &quot;Erinnofilia&quot; in Italy.

<doc id="406512" wikidata="Q121157" url="?curid=406512" title="Mashhad">
<text>Mashhad (; ) is the second-most-populous city in Iran, located in the relatively remote north-east of the country about from Tehran. In the Central District of Mashhad County, it serves as the capital of Razavi Khorasan province, the county, and the district. It has a population of about 3,400,000 (2016 census), which includes the areas of Mashhad Taman and Torqabeh.

The city was governed by different ethnic groups over the course of its history. Mashhad was previously a small village, which by the 9th century had been known as Sanabad, and which was located—along with Tus and other villages—on the ancient Silk Road connecting them with Merv to the east. Mashhad would eventually outgrow all its surrounding villages. It gained its current name meaning &quot;place of martyrdom&quot; in reference to the Imam Reza shrine, where the eighth Shia Imam, Ali al-Rida, is buried. The Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid is also buried within the same shrine. The shrine is an important place of pilgrimage, visited by 25 millions each year in what is often described as &quot;the holiest city in Iran&quot;.

Mashhad later also became associated with Ferdowsi, the Persian poet and author of the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, who was born in Tus (with many institutions in Mashhad named after him). Mashhad enjoyed relative prosperity in the Mongol period, and continued to grow. Between 1736 and 1796, Mashhad became the capital of Afsharid Iran which was ruled by the Afsharid dynasty founded by Nader Shah, whose tomb is located in the city. In the modern era, Mashhad continued to expand and became the hometown of some of the most significant literary figures and artists of modern Iran, such as the poet Mehdi Akhavan-Sales, and the traditional Iranian singer and composer Mohammad-Reza Shajarian. On 30 October 2009 (the anniversary of Imam Reza&#x27;s martyrdom), Iran&#x27;s then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared Mashhad to be &quot;Iran&#x27;s spiritual capital&quot;.

==History==
===Etymology and early history===
Ancient Greek sources mention the passage and residence of Alexander the Great in this land, which was called &quot;Susia&quot; (), in 330 BC. The map of Tabula Peutingeriana, which dates back to the early Roman era, names this city on the west of Merv, Alexandria, instead of Susia. Pliny the Elder, says there is a city in the middle of Parthia, near Arsace and Nisiaea, called &quot;Alexandropolis&quot; after its founder. Many Muslim historians, from the 10th to the 16th century AD, attribute the founding of &quot;Sanabad&quot; (the old name of the city) to Alexander. 

Also in the Shia hadith sources, which the narrators connect to the 7th to 9th centuries AD, there are quotations that Imam Ridha and Harun al-Rashid are buried in a city founded by &quot;the righteous servant, the two-horned one&quot;, which is an Islamic title commonly attributed to Alexander the Great.

The older name of Mashhad is Sanabad ( ). It was eventually renamed to Mashhad during the Safavid Empire. The name Mashhad comes from Arabic, meaning a Mazar (mausoleum). It is also known as the place where Ali ar-Ridha (Persian, Imam Reza), the eighth Imam of Shia Muslims, died (according to the Shias, was martyred). Reza&#x27;s shrine was placed there.

The ancient Parthian city of Patigrabanâ, mentioned in the Behistun inscription (520 BC) of the Achaemenid Emperor Darius the Great, may have been located at the Mashhad.

At the beginning of the 9th century (3rd century AH), Mashhad was a small city called Sanabad, which was situated away from Tus. There was a summer palace of Humayd ibn Qahtaba, the governor of Khurasan. In 808, when Harun al-Rashid, Abbasid caliph, was passing through to quell the insurrection of Rafi ibn al-Layth in Transoxania, he became ill and died. He was buried under the palace of Humayd ibn Qahtaba. Thus the Dar al-Imarah was known as the Mausoleum of Haruniyyeh. In 818, Ali al-Ridha was martyred by al-Ma&#x27;mun and was buried beside the grave of Harun. Although Mashhad owns the cultural heritage of Tus (including its figures like Nizam al-Mulk, Al-Ghazali, Ahmad Ghazali, Ferdowsi, Asadi Tusi, and Shaykh Tusi), earlier Arab geographers have correctly identified Mashhad and Tus as two separate cities that are now located about from each other.

===Mongolian invasion: Ilkhanids===
Although some believe that after this event, the city was called Mashhad al-Ridha (the place of martyrdom of al-Ridha), it seems that Mashhad, as a place-name, first appears in al-Maqdisi, i.e., in the last third of the 10th century. About the middle of the 14th century, the traveller Ibn Battuta uses the expression &quot;town of Mashhad al-Rida&quot;. Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the name Nuqan, which is still found on coins in the first half of the 14th century under the Il-Khanids, seems to have been gradually replaced by al-Mashhad or Mashhad.

Shias began to make pilgrimages to his grave. By the end of the 9th century, a dome was built above the grave, and many other buildings and bazaars sprang up around it. Over the course of more than a millennium, it has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. In 1161, however, the Seljuks seized the city, but they spared the sacred area their pillaging. Mashad al-Ridha was not considered a &quot;great&quot; city until Mongol raids in 1220, which caused the destruction of many large cities in Khurasan but leaving Mashhad relatively intact in the hands of Mongolian commanders because of the cemetery of Ali Al-Rezza and Harun al-Rashid (the latter was stolen). Thus the survivors of the massacres migrated to Mashhad. When the Arab traveller Ibn Battuta visited the town in 1333, he reported that it was a large town with abundant fruit trees, streams and mills. A great dome of elegant construction surmounts the noble mausoleum, the walls being decorated with colored tiles. The most well-known dish cooked in Mashhad, &quot;sholeh Mashhadi&quot; (شله مشهدی) or &quot;Sholeh&quot;, dates back to the era of the Mongolian invasion when it is thought to be cooked with any food available (the main ingredients are meat, grains and abundant spices) and be a Mongolian word.

===Timurid Empire===

It seems that the importance of Sanabad-Mashhad continually increased with the growing fame of its sanctuary and the decline of Tus, which received its death-blow in 1389 from Miran Shah, a son of Timur. When the Kartid noble who governed the place rebelled and attempted to make himself independent, Miran Shah was sent against him by his father. Tus was stormed after a siege of several months, sacked and left a heap of ruins; 10,000 inhabitants were massacred. Those who escaped the holocaust settled in the shelter of the &#x27;Alid sanctuary. Tus was henceforth abandoned and Mashhad took its place as the capital of the district.

Later on, during the reign of the Timurid Shahrukh Mirza, Mashhad became one of the main cities of the realm. In 1418, his wife Goharshad funded the construction of an outstanding mosque beside the shrine, which is known as the Goharshad Mosque. The mosque remains relatively intact to this date, its great size an indicator to the status the city held in the 15th century.

===Safavid Empire===
Ismail I, founder of the Safavid Empire, conquered Mashhad after the death of Husayn Bayqarah and the decline of the Timurid dynasty. He was later captured by the Uzbeks during the reign of Shah Abbas I. In the 16th century the town suffered considerably from the repeated raids of the Özbegs (Uzbeks). In 1507, it was taken by the troops of the Shaybani or Shabani Khan. After two decades, Shah Tahmasp I succeeded in repelling the enemy from the town again in 1528. But in 1544, the Özbegs again succeeded in entering the town and plundering and murdering there. The year 1589 was a disastrous one for Mashhad. The Shaybanid &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min after a four months&#x27; siege forced the town to surrender. Shah Abbas I, who lived in Mashhad from 1585 until his official ascent of the throne in Qazwin in 1587, was not able to retake Mashhad from the Özbegs until 1598. Mashhad was retaken by the Shah Abbas after a long and hard struggle, defeating the Uzbeks in a great battle near Herat as well as managing to drive them beyond the Oxus River. Abbas the Great wanted to encourage Iranians to go to Mashhad for pilgrimage. He is said to have walked from Isfahan to Mashhad. During the Safavid era, Mashhad gained even more religious recognition, becoming the most important city of Greater Khorasan, as several madrasah and other structures were built beside the Imam Reza shrine. Besides its religious significance, Mashhad has played an important political role as well. The Safavid dynasty has been criticized in a book (Red Shi&#x27;sm vs. Black Shi&#x27;ism) on the perceived dual aspects of the Shi&#x27;a religion throughout history) as a period in which although the dynasty didn&#x27;t form the idea of Black Shi&#x27;ism, but this idea was formed after the defeat of Shah Ismail against the Ottoman leader Sultan Yavuz Selim. Black Shi&#x27;ism is a product of the post-Safavid period.

===Afsharid Empire===
Mashad saw its greatest glory under Nader Shah, ruler of Iran from 1736 to 1747, and also a great benefactor of the shrine of Imam Reza, who made the city his capital. Nearly the whole eastern part of the kingdom of Nadir Shah passed to foreign rulers in this period of Persian impotence under the rule of the vigorous Ahmad Shah Durrani of the Afghan Durrani Empire. Ahmad defeated the Persians and took Mashhad after an eight-month siege in 1753. Ahmad Shah and his successor Timur Shah left Shah Rukh in possession of Khurasan as their vassal, making Khurasan a kind of buffer state between them and Persia. As the city&#x27;s real rulers, however, both these Durrani rulers struck coins in Mashhad. Otherwise, the reign of the blind Shah Rukh, which with repeated short interruptions lasted for nearly half a century, passed without any events of special note. It was only after the death of Timur Shah (1792) that Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, succeeded in taking Shah Rukh&#x27;s domains and putting him to death in 1795, thus ending the separation of Khurasan from the rest of Persia.

===Qajar Empire===

Some believe that Mashhad was ruled by Shahrukh Afshar and remained the capital of the Afsharid dynasty during Zand dynasty until Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar conquered the then larger region of Khorasan in 1796.

====1912 Imam Reza shrine bombardment====
In 1911 Yusuf Khan of Herat was declared independent in Mashhad as Muhammad Ali Shah and brought together a large group of reactionaries opposed to the revolution, and keep stirring for some time. This gave Russia the excuse to intervene and 29 March 1912 bombed the city; this bombing killed several people and pilgrims; action against a Muslim shrine caused a great shock to all Islamic countries. On 29 March 1912, the sanctuary of Imam Reza was bombed by the Russian artillery fire, causing some damage, including to the golden dome, resulting in a widespread and persisting resentment in the Shiite Muslim world as well as British India. This bombing was orchestrated by Prince Aristid Mikhailovich Dabizha (a Moldovan who was the Russian Consul in Mashhad) and General Radko (a Bulgarian who was commander of the Russian Cossacks in the city). Yusuf Khan ended up captured by the Persians and was executed.

===Pahlavi dynasty===
====Modernization under Reza Shah====

The modern development of the city accelerated under Reza Shah (1925-1941). Shah Reza Hospital (currently Imam Reza Hospital, affiliated with the Basij organization) was founded in 1934; the sugar factory of Abkuh in 1935; and the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in 1939. The city&#x27;s first power station was installed in 1936, and in 1939, the first urban transport service began with two buses. In this year the first population census was performed, with a result of 76,471 inhabitants.

====1935 Goharshad Mosque rebellion====

In 1935, a backlash against the modernizing, anti-religious policies of Reza Pahlavi erupted in the Mashhad shrine. Responding to a cleric who denounced the Shah&#x27;s heretical innovations, corruption, and heavy consumer taxes, many bazaars and villagers took refuge in the shrine, chanted slogans such as &quot;The Shah is a new Yazid.&quot; For four days local police and army refused to violate the shrine and the standoff was ended when troops from Azerbaijan arrived and broke into the shrine, killing dozens and injuring hundreds, and marking a final rupture between Shi&#x27;ite clergy and the Shah. According to some Mashhadi historians, the Goharshad Mosque uprising, which took place in 1935, is an uprising against Reza Shah&#x27;s decree banning all veils (headscarf and chador) on 8 January 1936.

====1941–1979 reforms====

Mashhad experienced population growth after the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941 because of relative insecurity in rural areas, the 1948 drought, and the establishment of Mashhad University in 1949. At the same time, public transport vehicles increased to 77 buses and 200 taxis and the railway link with the capital, Tehran, was established in 1957. The 1956 census reflected a population of 241,989 people. The increase in population continued in the following years thanks to the increase in Iranian oil revenues, the decline of the feudal social model, the agrarian reform of 1963, the founding of the city&#x27;s airport, the creation of new factories and the development of the health system. In 1966, the population reached 409,616 inhabitants, and 667,770 in 1976. The extension of the city was expanded from .

In 1965 an important urban renewal development project for the surroundings of the shrine of Imam Reza was proposed by the Iranian architect and urban designer Dariush Borbor to replace the dilapidated slum conditions which surrounded the historic monuments. The project was officially approved in 1968. In 1977 the surrounding areas were demolished to make way for the implementation of this project. To relocate the demolished businesses, a new bazaar was designed and constructed in Meydan-e Ab square (in Persian, &quot;میدان آب&quot;) by Dariush Borbor. After the revolution, the urban renewal project was abandoned.

====1994 Imam Reza shrine bombing====
On 20 June 1994, a bomb exploded in a prayer hall of the shrine of the Imam Reza. The bomb that killed at least 25 people on 20 June in Mashhad exploded on Ashura. The Pakistani terrorist, Ramzi Yousef, a Sunni Muslim turned Wahhabi, one of the main perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, was found to be behind the plot.

==Geography==
The city is located at 36.20º North latitude and 59.35º East longitude, in the valley of the Kashafrud River near Turkmenistan, between the two mountain ranges of Binalood and Hezar Masjed Mountains. The city benefits from the proximity of the mountains, having cool winters, pleasant springs, and mild summers. It is only about from Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.

The city is the administrative center of Mashhad County (or the &quot;Shahrestan&quot; of Mashhad) as well as the somewhat smaller district (&quot;Bakhsh&quot;) of Mashhad. The city itself, excluding parts of the surrounding &quot;Bakhsh&quot; and &quot;Shahrestan&quot;, is divided into 13 smaller administrative units, with a total population of more than 3 million.

===Climate===
Mashhad features a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;BShk&quot;) with very hot summers, cold winters and Mediterranean-like dry summer precipitation pattern. The city only sees about of precipitation per year, some of which occasionally falls in the form of snow. Mashhad has wetter and drier periods with the bulk of the annual precipitation falling between the months of December and May. Summers are typically hot and dry, with high temperatures sometimes exceeding . Winters are typically cool to cold and somewhat damper, with overnight lows routinely dropping below freezing. Mashhad enjoys on average just above 2900 hours of sunshine per year.

Snow cover had been observed in 21.1 days annually, with only 3.8 days in which the snow depth exceeds .

The highest recorded temperature was on 6 July 1998 and the lowest recorded temperature was on 3 February 1972.


==Demography==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 2,410,800 in 621,697 households. The following census in 2011 counted 2,766,258 people in 804,391 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 3,001,184 people in 914,146 households.

===Ethnic groups===
The vast majority of Mashhadi people are ethnic Persians, who form the majority of the city&#x27;s population. Other ethnic groups include Kurdish and Turkmen people who have emigrated recently to the city from the North Khorasan province. There is also a significant community of non-Arabic speakers of Arabian descent who have retained a distinct Arabian culture, cuisine and religious practices.

There are also over 20 million pilgrims who visit the city every year.

===Religion===

Today, the holy shrine and its museum hold one of the most extensive cultural and artistic treasuries of Iran, in particular manuscript books and paintings. Several important theological schools are associated with the shrine of the Eighth Imam.

The second-largest holy city in the world, Mashhad attracts more than 20 million tourists and pilgrims every year, many of whom come to pay homage to the Imam Reza shrine (the eighth Shi&#x27;ite Imam). It has been a magnet for travellers since medieval times. Thus, even as those who complete the pilgrimage to Mecca receive the title of &quot;Haji&quot;, those who make the pilgrimage to Mashhad—and especially to the Imam Reza shrine—are known as &quot;Mashtee&quot;, a term employed also of its inhabitants. As an important problem, the duration when new passengers stay in Mashhad has been considerably reduced to 2 days nowadays and they prefer to finish their trip immediately after doing pilgrimage and shopping in the markets. There are about 3000–5000 unauthorized residential units in Mashhad, which, as a unique statistic worldwide, has caused various problems in the city.

Although mainly inhabited by Muslims, there were in the past some religious minorities in Mashhad, mainly Jews who were forcibly converted to Islam in 1839 after the Allahdad incident took place for Mashhadi Jews in 1839. They became known as Jadid al-Islam (&quot;Newcomers in Islam&quot;). On the outside, they adapted to the Islamic way of life, but often secretly kept their faith and traditions.

==Economy==
Mashhad is Iran&#x27;s second largest automobile production hub. The city&#x27;s economy is based mainly on dry fruits, salted nuts, saffron, Iranian sweets like gaz and sohaan, precious stones like agates, turquoise, intricately designed silver jewelry studded with rubies and emeralds, eighteen carat gold jewelry, perfumes, religious souvenirs, trench coats, scarves, termeh, carpets, and rugs.

According to the writings and documents, the oldest existing carpet attributed to the city belongs to the reign of Shah Abbas (Abbas I of Persia). Also, there is a type of carpet, classified as Mashhad Turkbâf, which, as its name suggests, is woven by hand with Turkish knots by craftsmen who emigrated from Tabriz to Mashhad in the nineteenth century. Among other major industries in the city are the nutrition, clothing, leather, textiles, chemical, steel, metallic, and non-metallic mineral industries, construction materials factories, &amp; the handicraft industry.

With more than 55% of all the hotels in Iran, Mashhad is the hub of tourism in the country. Religious shrines are the most powerful attractions for foreign travelers; every year, 20 to 30 million pilgrims from Iran and more than 2 million pilgrims and tourists from elsewhere around the world come to Mashhad. Mashhad is one of the main producers of leather products in the region.

Unemployment, poverty, drug addiction, and theft are the most important social problems of the city.

The divorce rate in Mashhad had increased by 35 percent by 2014. Khorasan and Mashhad ranked the second in violence across the country in 2013.

===Astan Quds Razavi===
At the same time, the city has kept its character as a goal of pilgrimage, dominated by the strength of the economic and political authority of the Astan Quds Razavi, the administration of the Shrine waqf, probably the most important in the Muslim world and the largest active bonyad in Iran. The Astan Quds Razavi is a major player in the economy of the city of Mashhad. The land occupied by the shrine has grown fourfold since 1979 according to the head of the foundation&#x27;s international relations department. The Shrine of Imam Reza is vaster than Vatican City. The foundation owns most of the real estate in Mashhad and rents out shop space to bazaaris and hoteliers. The main resource of the institution is endowments, estimated to have annual revenue of $210 billion. Ahmad Marvi is the current Custodian of Astan Quds Razavi.

===Padideh Shandiz===

Padideh Shandiz International Tourism Development Company, an Iranian private joint-stock holding company, behaves like a public company by selling stocks despite being a joint-stock in the field of restaurants, tourism and construction, with a football club (Padideh F.C.; formerly named Azadegan League club Mes Sarcheshmeh). In January 2015, the company was accused of a &quot;fraud&quot; worth $34.3 billion, which is one eighth of Iran budget.

===Credit institutions===
Several credit institutions have been established in Mashhad, including Samenolhojaj (), Samenola&#x27;emmeh () and Melal (formerly Askariye, ). The depositors of the first institution have faced problem in receiving cash from the institution.

===Others===
The city&#x27;s International Exhibition Center is the second most active exhibition center after Tehran, which due to proximity to Central Asian countries hosts dozens of international exhibitions each year. Companies such as Smart-innovators in Mashhad are pioneers in electrical and computer technology.

==Language==
The language mainly spoken in Mashhad is Persian with a variating Mashhadi accent, which can at times, prove itself as a sort of dialect. The Mashhadi Persian dialect is somewhat different from the standard Persian dialect in some of its tones and stresses. 

==Culture==
===Religious seminaries===

Long a center of secular and religious learning, Mashhad has been a center for the Islamic arts and sciences, as well as piety and pilgrimage. Mashhad was an educational centre, with a considerable number of Islamic schools (madrasas, the majority of them, however, dating from the later Safavid period. Mashhad Hawza (Persian: حوزه علمیه مشهد) is one of the largest seminaries of traditional Islamic school of higher learning in Mashhad, which was headed by Abbas Vaez-Tabasi (who was Chairman of the Astan Quds Razavi board from 1979) after the revolution, and in which Iranian politician and clerics such as Ali Khamenei, Ahmad Alamolhoda, Abolghasem Khazali, Mohammad Reyshahri, Morteza Motahhari, Abbas Vaez-Tabasi, and Madmoud Halabi (the founder of Hojjatieh and Mohammad Hadi Abd-e Khodaee learned Islamic studies).

<text>GameLine was a dialup game distribution service for the Atari 2600, developed and operated by Control Video Corporation (CVC, now AOL). Subscribers could install the proprietary modem and storage cartridge in their home game console, accessing the GameLine service to download games over a telephone line. GameLine had an exclusive selection of games, and its pioneering business model eventually gave rise to America Online. Despite being ahead of its time, it wasn&#x27;t very popular, possibly due to its price of $60 for the hardware, $15 for the membership fee, and $1 per game, which you could only keep for a week.

In 1983, cable pioneer William von Meister was looking for a way to use his modem transmission technology, which was previously acquired in ill-fated attempts of sending music to cable companies. Legal issues caused cable providers to step away from the service, leaving Von Meister with a delivery tool and no content.

He then converted his variable speed adaptive modem technology to download games from central servers to individual households. This allowed users to dial a system and, for a fee, download games to their GameLine modules. The game would typically work for 5-10 plays, after which the user would have to connect to GameLine again and pay for another download.

The &quot;Master Module&quot; has 8 KB of RAM and a 1,200 Bps modem, and physically resembles an oversized silver Atari cartridge. It has a phone jack on the side that was used to link the Master Module with the CVC computers. The module is able to transmit with pulse or tone dialing, allowing the unit to be versatile in the field. The games available on the GameLine service were all from third-party gamemakers, the largest of which was Imagic. CVC tried, but failed to obtain licensing agreements from the largest game makers, such as Atari, Activision, Coleco, Mattel, and Parker Brothers.

==Membership benefits==
When a user registered with the service, they were given a PIN. This PIN was used to log into the central CVC computer and download the requested games. One of the benefits of registering was that users were given free games on their birthday.

GameLine provided players an opportunity to compete in contests with selected games, where they could upload a high score. Prizes would be awarded to regional (and supposedly national) champions. One such regional prize was a GameLine windbreaker.

Each subscriber to GameLine also received a professionally printed magazine titled &quot;GameLiner&quot;. &quot;GameLiner&quot; consists of information about new games added to the service, questions and answers, advice on better gameplay, and a list of all currently available games on GameLine.

==Discontinuation==
GameLine was originally envisioned to provide not just games, but also news (NewsLine), stock quotes (StockLine), sports reporting and scores (SportLine), electronic mail (MailLine), online banking (BankLine), online forums (OpinionLine), and a wide variety of information including airline schedules, horoscopes, and classified ads (InfoLine). GameLine ceased operations before any of these expanded services were offered, though StockLine and SportsLine were reportedly near complete implementation.

Control Video Corporation was one of many smaller companies that went bust in the video game crash of 1983.

==Legacy==
Even though the GameLine was discontinued, the investors and founding members of CVC went on to start a new company that would continue to use the technological infrastructure they had built. The company, named Quantum Computer Services, was created by Steve Case, among others. This company created a service named Quantum Link which linked together Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 users offering many of the expanded services originally envisioned for GameLine. Quantum Computer Services eventually became America Online in October 1991, which became extremely successful during the 1990s, and eventually took over Time Warner in 2001, but was spun off a few years later. Though the company still technically exists, support for the GameLine does not.

The game titled &quot;Save The Whales&quot; was exclusive to the GameLine and although it was never released on a cartridge, a prototype was found in early 2002.

==Game list==
GameLine offered the following games:

<doc id="406521" wikidata="Q5330595" url="?curid=406521" title="Eastern freshwater cod">
<text>The eastern freshwater cod (Maccullochella ikei), also known as the eastern cod or Clarence River cod, is a large predatory freshwater fish of the genus &quot;Maccullochella&quot; and the family Percichthyidae, that occur in the coastal Clarence River system of north-eastern New South Wales. Eastern freshwater cod are closely related to the Murray cod of the Murray-Darling River system, and are considered an icon of the Clarence River system.

A long-lived, slow-growing species, eastern freshwater cod are threatened by poaching [i.e. illegal take], habitat degradation, catastrophic natural events such as bushfires, and inbreeding from low genetic diversity. They are currently classified as endangered and protected by law from human exploitation of any kind.

==Range==
Eastern freshwater cod are native to the Clarence River system in northern New South Wales, Australia. The Clarence River system is an extensive East Coast drainage with many tributaries of differing size. By Australian standards, the Clarence River and its major tributaries the Mann and Nymboida Rivers are extremely large rivers with extremely large flow volumes.

Eastern freshwater cod originally occurred in great abundance throughout the system, to significant altitudes. Though reportedly &quot;M. ikei&quot; were never found above the large falls in some headwaters, the uppermost reaches of many tributaries feature in this species&#x27; range.

The indigenous cod population of the Richmond River system (Richmond River cod), now extinct, are believed to have been a sub-population of eastern freshwater cod. The Richmond River has been restocked with fingerlings (juvenile fish) produced from Clarence River cod, but no evidence of breeding has been found.

A closely related freshwater cod was historically common in the Brisbane River system, however the exact taxonomic status of the now-extinct Brisbane River cod is not known.

==Appearance and size==
The eastern freshwater cod is a small to medium-sized grouper-like fish with a deep, elongated body that is round in cross section and a broad, scooped head, and a large mouth lined with pads of very small needle-like teeth. The jaws are equal, or the lower jaw may protrude slightly. The eyes are slightly larger and more prominent than in Murray cod.

The spiny dorsal fin is moderate in height and is partially separated by a notch from the high, rounded soft dorsal fin. Soft dorsal, anal, and caudal (tail) fins are all large and rounded, and are dusky grey or black with distinct white edges. The large, rounded pectoral fins are usually similar in colour to flanks. The pelvic fins are large and angular, set forward of the pectoral fins, and are usually a translucent greyish-white colour, tending toward opacity in large fish. The leading greyish-white coloured rays on the pelvic fins split into two trailing filaments. These filaments are significantly longer than in Murray cod.

Eastern freshwater cod are vary from cream or greyish-white to yellow on their ventral (“belly”) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually an intense yellow or gold in colour, overlain with a dense pattern of black to very dark green mottling. The effect is a marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard&#x27;s markings. Colouration does vary considerably however and eastern freshwater cod from dark, heavily shaded habitats can be very dark or almost black in colour.

Eastern freshwater cod were historically recorded reaching sizes well over 1 metre in length and up to 48 kg in weight, but today are commonly less than 60 cm in length and less than 5 kg in weight. Large fish are rare today.

==Origins==
Eastern freshwater cod are a species of cod that is descended from the Murray cod, &quot;Maccullochella peelii&quot;, present in tributaries of the Murray-Darling Basin on the western side of the Great Dividing Range. Murray cod entered an east coast river system, likely the Clarence, via a natural event somewhere between 0.62 and 1.62 million years ago (mean estimate 1.1 mya), as estimated by DNA divergence rates. Subsequent isolation from Murray cod populations, the founder effect, genetic drift, and natural selection lead to allopatric speciation.

In addition to eastern freshwater cod of the Clarence River system, cod are/were to be found in several other coastal river systems. In total, at the time of European settlement of the Australia in the 18th century, naturally occurring cod were present and abundant in four East Coast river systems:

* Clarence River system, northern New South Wales (eastern freshwater cod, &quot;Maccullochella ikei&quot;)
* Richmond River system, northern New South Wales (Richmond River cod, &quot;Maccullochella ikei&quot;)
* Brisbane River system and its Logan-Albert and Coomera River sub-systems, southern Queensland (Brisbane River cod, &quot;Maccullochella&quot; sp.)
* Mary River system, central Queensland (Mary River cod, &quot;Maccullochella mariensis&quot;)

Several genetic studies have found that eastern freshwater cod, in the southernmost of these four rivers, and Mary River cod, in the northernmost of these four rivers, are more closely related to each other than to Murray cod. This suggests that Murray cod only managed to cross into east coast river systems once. It is not clear which of the four river systems was the original entry point, but geomorphological evidence suggests the headwaters of the Clarence River. The mechanism by which Murray cod crossed the Great Dividing Range are considered to be either river capture, where the headwaters of an easterly-flowing coastal river cuts back (in the erosional sense) and intercepts and &quot;captures&quot; the headwaters (and fish fauna) of a previously westerly flowing stream, or a &quot;wet divide&quot;, where extreme flooding or a very wet climatic phase created swamps in a topographic low point that effectively connected the headwaters of western flowing and eastern flowing streams.

After crossing the Great Dividing Range, drops in sea level during glacial periods (ice ages) and/or &quot;lateral&quot; river capture events linked these four coastal rivers at times, allowing freshwater cod to gain access to these rivers and colonise them. The mean estimate for genetic separation of Mary River cod and eastern freshwater cod is only 300,000 years.

DNA analysis reveals eastern freshwater cod of the Clarence River system went through one or more population bottlenecks before European settlement. This was likely due to a sequence of catastrophic drought, whole-of-catchment-scale bushfire and severe, widespread ash-induced fish kills, similar to those which occurred in 1936 (see below). Eastern freshwater cod numbers recovered from these pre-European bottleneck events, and the fish were abundant by the time of European settlement, but the species appears to have lost some genetic diversity. Further, very significant losses in genetic diversity occurred when European settlers caused catastrophic declines, and to a lesser extent by recent stockings of hatchery fish with low genetic diversity.

==Habitat and diet==
Eastern freshwater cod are found in clear-flowing rivers and streams with rocky beds and deep holes within the Clarence River system, to significant altitudes. They inhabit all sizes of rivers and streams. Eastern freshwater cod are territorial and aggressive. The bulk of their diet is based on crustaceans (the large, clawed &quot;Macrobrachium&quot; shrimp and the small, clawless &quot;Paratya&quot; shrimp) and other fish, but they are powerful opportunistic predators and are also known to take insects (e.g. cicadas), frogs, snakes, lizards, birds, and small mammals.

==Lifecycle==
Growth is highly variable in eastern freshwater cod, but overall is slower than in Murray cod. The oldest specimen yet aged was only 14 years old, but this likely reflects limited sampling and many decades of overfishing and poaching that have led to the loss of most large individuals. There is little doubt the species has the potential to reach or exceed the maximum age recorded in Murray cod (48 years).

Eastern freshwater cod are sexually mature at 4 to 5 years old, and at sizes as small as 700 g, the latter being markedly smaller than in Murray cod. This appears to be an evolved adaptation to the rocky, low-nutrient, and often quite small waterways in which they found. The trout cod, a &quot;Maccullochella&quot; cod, once found in comparable habitats in the Murray-Darling system, displays a similar trait.

Eastern freshwater cod spawn in early spring when water temperatures exceed 16 °C, using rock structures as sites for the adhesive eggs. Most other aspects of their spawning, including the guarding of eggs and newly hatched larvae by the male fish, are similar to Murray cod. The breeding season is 8–10 weeks long. Males clean and protect nesting sites until females enter and a complex spawning ritual is performed. The males then protect the eggs until hatching, and continue to defend the larvae for 12–14 days until they disperse.

While specifically targeting this protected species is prohibited, it is also important for anglers to avoid any accidental captures of eastern freshwater cod in winter when they are developing their roe (eggs), or in early spring when spawning is occurring, as research indicates this results in resorbed roe or abandoned nests, respectively, and a failed spawning effort. (The eggs in abandoned nests are rapidly consumed by shrimp, turtles and small fish.) A total fishing closure is in effect on the Mann and Nymboida Rivers and their tributaries between August and October each year specifically to prevent this.

==Conservation status==
Following heavy declines in numbers and distribution, the eastern freshwater cod is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN.

===Population decline===
Early records show that eastern freshwater cod were extremely abundant in the all parts of the Clarence River system at the time of European settlement. They were so abundant that they were caught &quot;on demand&quot; for diners at one riverside hotel, and were reportedly even used as pig feed, as were the related Mary River Cod.

A number of factors have led to the decline of eastern freshwater cod. One factor was decades of pronounced overfishing, including with lines, nets, explosives, and spears. As a very slow-growing top predator with low fecundity, eastern freshwater cod are even more vulnerable to overfishing than Murray cod.

Another factor were several huge bushfires (on the scale of the entire catchment) in the 1920s and 1930s, but particularly a bushfire in late 1936. These caused severe and widespread ash-induced fish kills in the first rainfall events post-fire.

Habitat degradation and siltation brought on by poor farming practices (such as clearing riverbank vegetation and allowing stock to trample river banks) has also destroyed many eastern freshwater cod habitats. Some of these practices leading to land degradation are still continuing.

===Mining pollution===
Tin mining and dredging/sluicing for tin caused serious and widespread pollution of the Clarence River system in the late 19th century/early 20th century, with dozens of newspaper reports suggesting it reached its worst extent in the mid-late 1930s. These reports detail numerous pollution events characterised by milk-coloured stinking water, stained river rocks, cattle refusing to drink river water, and hundreds or thousands of dead fish per event. An article in The Daily Examiner from 11 October 1935 states that pollution was &quot;causing alarm amongst fishermen, stockowners and people interested in preserving the Clarence and its tributaries as tourist attractions&quot;, and that farmers had trouble in getting their stock to drink from the polluted water. It includes statements from fishermen who describe fish &quot;dead in thousands&quot;.

This tin mining pollution caused many severe fish kills and was probably a key factor in the extirpation of eastern freshwater cod from large tracts of the Clarence River system in the 1930s.

===Conservation actions===
The above factors, which have in the past led to the extinction of the Richmond River cod and the Brisbane River cod and the endangerment of the Mary River cod, have reduced the eastern freshwater cod from an abundant fish found in all parts of the Clarence River system to an endangered fish absent from most parts of it. It survives only in limited, remote parts of the Nymboida/Mann and Guy Fawkes/Sara sections. The latter population is now at risk of severe inbreeding depression and is in need of &quot;genetic rescue&quot; via translocation of genetically differing fish from the former, more diverse population. Currently there are no management plans to undertake such translocations.

Eastern freshwater cod were recognised as a potentially separate and endangered species of cod in 1984, and were declared a protected species in that year. Subsequent research confirmed this finding. While a high level of poaching is still taking place, legal protection has played a large role in finally allowing the species to commence a limited natural recovery.

A restocking programme was undertaken by the government of New South Wales in 1984-1989, but was then closed and contracted to a private operation, which produced and stocked fingerlings until the late 1990s. The eastern freshwater cod stocking programme was suspended after genetic research indicated the fingerlings being produced had lower than desirable levels of genetic diversity. No eastern freshwater cod are currently being bred or stocked.

Concern has been expressed over the future of eastern freshwater cod stocks in the Clarence River system after the NSW Fisheries department allowed a stocking of Australian bass fingerlings from a completely different bioregion to proceed. The fingerlings were contaminated with and introduced the banded grunter (&quot;Amniataba percoides&quot;), an aggressive small native fish, to the lower reaches of the river. It is feared that banded grunter may yet invade the main freshwater reaches of the Clarence River system, with possibly devastating impacts on eastern freshwater cod.

==Species description and etymology==
The Eastern freshwater cod was first formally described in 1986 by Stuart J. Rowland with the type locality given as the confluence of the Nymboida River with the Mann River in New South Wales. Rowland gave it the specific name &quot;ikei&quot; in honour of his father Isaac &quot;Ike&quot; Morgan Rowland who was an angler and who enjoyed catching freshwater cod.

<text>At the 1976 Summer Olympics two archery events were contested. It was the second iteration of the modern archery competition in the Olympics, following the same format as in the 1972 Summer Olympics. The two events were men&#x27;s individual and women&#x27;s individual, and the competition in each event consisted of a double FITA round. Archers shot a total of 288 arrows at 4 different distances (90, 70, 50, and 30 meters for men; 70, 60, 50, and 30 metres for women).

==Medal summary==
The United States repeated its sweep of the two gold medals. Japan and Italy claimed their first archery medals in the men&#x27;s competition. The Soviet Union took the silver and bronze medals in the women&#x27;s competition, adding to the bronze they had earned four years earlier.

<text>Touko Valio Laaksonen (8 May 1920 – 7 November 1991), known by the pseudonym Tom of Finland, was a Finnish artist who made stylized highly masculinized homoerotic art, and influenced late 20th-century gay culture. He has been called the &quot;most influential creator of gay pornographic images&quot; by cultural historian Joseph W. Slade. Over the course of four decades, he produced some 3,500 illustrations, mostly featuring men with exaggerated sex traits, wearing tight or partially removed clothing.

==Early life==
Laaksonen was born on 8 May 1920 and raised by a middle-class family in Kaarina, a town in southwestern Finland, near the city of Turku. Both of his parents Suoma and Edwin Laaksonen were schoolteachers at the grammar school that served Kaarina. The family lived in the school building&#x27;s attached living quarters.

He went to school in Turku and in 1939, at the age of 19, he moved to Helsinki to study advertising. In his spare time he also started drawing erotic images for his own pleasure, based on images of male laborers he had seen from an early age. At first he kept these drawings hidden, but then destroyed them &quot;at least by the time I went to serve the army.&quot; The country became embroiled in the Winter War with the Soviet Union, and then became formally involved in World War II, and he was conscripted in February 1940 into the Finnish Army. He served as an anti-aircraft officer, holding the rank of second lieutenant. He later attributed his fetishistic interest in uniformed men to encounters with men in army uniform, especially soldiers of the German Wehrmacht serving in Finland at that time. &quot;In my drawings I have no political statements to make, no ideology. I am thinking only about the picture itself. The whole Nazi philosophy, the racism and all that, is hateful to me, but of course I drew them anyway—they had the sexiest uniforms!&quot; After the war, in 1945, he returned to studies.

Laaksonen&#x27;s artwork of this period compared to later works is considered more romantic and softer with &quot;gentle-featured shapes and forms&quot;. The men featured were middle-class, as opposed to the sailors, bikers, lumberjacks, construction workers, and other members of stereotypically hypermasculine working class groups that feature in his later work. Another key difference is the lack of dramatic compositions, self-assertive poses, muscular bodies, and &quot;detached exotic settings&quot; that his later work embodied.

==Career==
In 1956 Laaksonen submitted drawings to the influential American magazine &quot;Physique Pictorial&quot;, which premiered the images in the 1957 Spring issue under the pseudonym &quot;Tom&quot;, as it resembled his given name &quot;Touko&quot;. In the Winter issue later that year, editor Bob Mizer coined the credit &quot;Tom of Finland&quot;. One of his pieces was featured on the Spring 1957 cover, depicting two log drivers at work with a third man watching them. Pulled from the Finnish mythology of lumberjacks representing strong masculinity, Laaksonen emphasized and privileged &quot;homoerotic potentiality [...] relocating it in a gay context&quot;, a strategy repeated throughout his career.

The post-World War II era saw the rise of the biker subculture as rejecting &quot;the reorganization and normalization of life after the war, with its conformist, settled lifestyle.&quot; Biker subculture was both marginal and oppositional, and provided postwar gay men with a stylized masculinity that included rebelliousness and danger. This was in contrast to the then-prevailing stereotypes of the gay man as effeminate (sissy), as seen in vaudeville and films going back to the first years of the industry. Laaksonen was influenced by images of bikers as well as artwork of George Quaintance and Etienne, among others, that he cited as his precursors, &quot;disseminated to gay readership through homoerotic physique magazines&quot; starting in 1950. Laaksonen&#x27;s drawings of bikers and leathermen capitalized on the leather and denim outfits which differentiated those men from mainstream culture and suggested they were untamed, physical, and self-empowered. This in contrast with the mainstream, medically and psychologically sad and sensitive young gay man who is passive. Laaksonen&#x27;s drawings of this time &quot;can be seen as consolidating an array of factors, styles and discourses already existing in the 1950s gay subcultures,&quot; which may have led to them being widely distributed and popularized within those cultures. Starting his professional career in 1958 as a creative executive in renowned marketing agency, McCann Helsinki, further encouraged his creativity.

=== U.S. censorship codes (1950s–1960s) ===
Laaksonen&#x27;s style and content in the late 1950s and early 1960s was partly influenced by the U.S. censorship codes that restricted depiction of &quot;overt homosexual acts&quot;. His work was published in the beefcake genre that began in the 1930s and predominantly featured photographs of attractive, muscular young men in athletic poses often shown demonstrating exercises. Their primary market was gay men, but because of the conservative and homophobic social culture of the era, gay pornography was illegal and the publications were typically presented as dedicated to physical fitness and health. They were often the only connection that closeted men had to their sexuality. By this time, however, Laaksonen was rendering private commissions, so more explicit work was produced but remained unpublished. Aside from his work at the advertising agency, Laaksonen operated a small mail-order business, distributing reproductions of his artwork around the world by post, though he did not generate much income this way.

In the 1962 case of &quot;MANual Enterprises v. Day&quot; the United States Supreme Court ruled that nude male photographs were not inherently obscene. Softcore gay pornography magazines and films featuring fully nude models, some of them tumescent, quickly appeared and the pretense of being about exercise and fitness was dropped as controls on pornography were reduced. By the end of the 1960s the market for beefcake magazines collapsed. Laaksonen was able to publish his more overtly homoerotic work and it changed the context with &quot;new possibilities and conventions for displaying frontal male nudity in magazines and movies.&quot; Laaksonen reacted by publishing more explicit drawings and stylized his figures&#x27; fantastical aspects with exaggerated physical aspects, particularly their genitals and muscles. In the late 1960s he developed Kake, a character appearing in an ongoing series of comics, which debuted in 1968.

=== Gay mainstream appeal (1970s–1991) ===
With the decriminalization of male nudity, gay pornography became more mainstream in gay cultures, and Laaksonen&#x27;s work along with it. By 1973, he was publishing erotic comic books and making inroads to the mainstream art world with exhibitions. In 1973 he gave up his full-time job at the Helsinki office of advertising agency McCann. &quot;Since then I&#x27;ve lived in jeans and lived on my drawings,&quot; is how he described the lifestyle transition which occurred during this period.

By the mid-1970s he was also emphasizing a photorealistic style, making aspects of the drawings appear more photographic. Many of his drawings are based on photographs, but none are exact reproductions of them. The photographic inspiration is used, on the one hand, to create lifelike, almost moving images, with convincing and active postures and gestures while Laaksonen exaggerates physical features and presents his ideal of masculine beauty and sexual allure, combining realism with fantasy. In &quot;Daddy and the Muscle Academy – The Art, Life, and Times of Tom of Finland&quot; examples of photographs and the drawings based upon them are shown side by side. Although he considered the photographs to be merely reference tools for his drawings, contemporary art students have seen them as complete works of art that stand on their own.

In 1979, Laaksonen, with businessman and friend Durk Dehner, co-founded the Tom of Finland Company to preserve the copyright on his art, which had been widely pirated. Tom was introduced to Dehner by his pen pal and fellow erotic artist Dom Orejudos. Also in 1979, Laaksonen and Lou Thomas (a co-founder of Colt Studio) published &quot;Target by Tom; The Natural Man,&quot; a series of photographs and drawings of adult performers including Bruno, Jeremy Brent, Chuck Gatlin, and Steve Sartori.

In 1984 the Tom of Finland Foundation was established to collect, preserve, and exhibit homoerotic artwork. Although Laaksonen was quite successful at this point, with his biography on the best-seller list, and Benedikt Taschen, the world&#x27;s largest art book publisher reprinting and expanding a monograph of his works, he was most proud of the Foundation. The scope of the organization expanded to erotic works of all types, sponsored contests, exhibits, and started the groundwork for a museum of erotic art.

Laaksonen developed a &quot;wonderfully rich relationship&quot; with Bill Schmeling during the 1980s when they lived in Los Angeles; the two men set up artist salons in their homes and shared artistic practices as well as life experiences. Schmeling cited Laaksonen as having considerably influenced his artistic style.

=== Death ===
Laaksonen was diagnosed with emphysema in 1988. Eventually the disease and medication caused his hands to tremble, leading him to switch media from pencil to pastel. He died in 1991 of an emphysema-induced stroke.

==Private life==

Laaksonen&#x27;s life partner was the dancer Veli &quot;Nipa&quot; Mäkinen with whom he shared his life for 28 years, until Mäkinen&#x27;s death in 1981.

==Reception==

When examining the reception of Laaksonen&#x27;s art, it is impossible to separate it from its original purpose. His &quot;dirty drawings&quot;, as he himself called them, served primarily as gay erotica, intended to arouse the viewer. As described by Rob Meijer, owner of a leathershop and art gallery in Amsterdam, &quot;These works are not conversation pieces, they&#x27;re masturbation pieces.&quot; Many of his drawings were published in publications like Physique Pictorial, or were advertisements and murals for bath houses, leather bars and clubs, which were erotically charged or explicitly sexual spaces.

They also contributed to the spread of a new gay masculinity and confidence. In oral histories, for example, the works of Laaksonen are repeatedly described as influential for one&#x27;s own sexual biography. Many men identified with his characters, who were pictured as masculine, virile and often blue-collar, thus defeating homophobic stereotypes of effeminacy. Kate Wolf writes that &quot;Tom of Finland helped pave the way to gay liberation&quot;.

Laaksonen&#x27;s drawings were particularly popular in the flourishing leather subculture of the 1950s to 1970s. Tom&#x27;s drawings were central to the development and dissemination of a more unified gay leather aesthetic, resulting in the so-called &quot;clone look&quot; of the 1970s and 1980s. During his lifetime and beyond, Laaksonen&#x27;s work has drawn both admiration and disdain from different quarters of the artistic community. Laaksonen developed a friendship with gay photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, whose work depicting sado-masochism and fetish iconography was also subject to controversy.

A controversial theme in his drawings was the erotic treatment of men in Nazi uniforms. They form a small part of his overall work, but the typically flattering visual treatment of these characters has led some viewers to infer sympathy or affinity for Nazism, and they have been omitted from most recent anthologies of his work. Later in his career Laaksonen disavowed this work and was at pains to dissociate himself and his work from fascist or racist ideologies. He also depicted a significant number of black men in his drawings, with no overt racial or political message in the context in which they appear; although they bear some commonality with racist caricatures of the &quot;hypersexual&quot; black male, these traits are shared by Laaksonen&#x27;s white characters as well. 

Sheila Jeffreys offers a radical feminist critique of Laaksonen&#x27;s work in her 2003 book &quot;Unpacking Queer Politics&quot;.

Art critics have mixed views about Laaksonen&#x27;s work. His detailed drawing technique has led to him being described as a &quot;master with a pencil&quot;, while in contrast a reviewer for Dutch newspaper &quot;Het Parool&quot; described his work as &quot;illustrative but without expressivity&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Artforum&quot;, Kevin Killian said that seeing Tom of Finland originals &quot;produces a strong respect for his nimble, witty creation&quot;. 

==Cultural impact and legacy==
In 2006, historian Jack Fritscher wrote:If there is a gay Mount Rushmore of four great pioneer pop artists, the faces would be Chuck Arnett, Etienne, A. Jay, and Tom of Finland.Laaksonen&#x27;s artwork inspired numerous other artists to explore explicit sexuality in their own art, and some (like MATT) dedicated works of art in his memory.

In 2019, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported:Tom’s cocksure leather look — a breakout sultry aesthetic dating to the 1950s — captured the early attention of artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe, Raymond Pettibon and Mike Kelley. It also influenced fashion and music: designers Jean-Paul Gaultier and Thierry Mugler and Queen’s Freddie Mercury. Today, Finland embraces its artist-son as a national hero, one backed by plenty of online merch — as diverse as sex toys and holiday ornaments. Tom’s bevy of built rogues, always affable and forever awash in unapologetic lust, has indeed aged well.

=== Tom of Finland Company ===
Laaksonen and Dehner established the Tom of Finland Company in 1978 to oversee the publication of Laaksonen&#x27;s work and to combat copyright infringement. In 1995, Tom of Finland Clothing Company introduced a fashion line based on his works, which covers a wide array of looks besides the typified cutoff-jeans-and-jacket style of his drawings. The fashion line balances the original homoeroticism of the drawings with mainstream fashion culture, and their runway shows occur in many of the venues during the same times as other fashion companies.

=== Tom of Finland Foundation ===
Laaksonen and Dehner founded the nonprofit Tom of Finland Foundation (ToFF) in 1984 to preserve Laaksonen&#x27;s catalog of work. After several years, they broadened ToFF&#x27;s mission to &quot;offer a safe haven for all erotic art.&quot; ToFF holds the world&#x27;s largest collection of Laaksonen art (about 1,500 works) as well as one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of erotic art (more than 100,000 images of materials). ToFF produces an annual competition for emerging artists to exhibit their work for publicity and awards. The foundation also hosts social events to fundraise and provide opportunity for like-minded fans of erotic art to meet, including the annual, two-day Tom of Finland Art and Culture Festival.

ToFF&#x27;s Erotic Artist Hall of Fame recognizes exemplary erotic artists including H. R. Giger, Bill Schmeling, and Rex.

ToFF derives some income from its public programming and by licensing Laaksonen&#x27;s images and name for commercial use, but it depends on donations and membership dues. ToFF is a separate entity distinct from the Tom of Finland Company, from which it receives financial support.
==== TOM House ====
ToFF is headquartered at TOM House, a home in Echo Park, Los Angeles owned by Dehner at which Laaksonen lived for about a decade in his final years and where he created about 800 artworks (20% of his body of work). Laaksonen stayed for six-months at a time due to the restrictions on his visa. His bedroom has been preserved in much the same state as when he resided there before his 1991 death. The 14-room home is filled with erotic art (even the ceilings are covered in it). Other amenities include a basement dungeon (open by invitation only) and a &quot;Pleasure Park&quot; of sloped terraces and sitting areas in the backyard.

ToFF offers tours of the house by appointment. The home also hosts public events, including nude life drawing sessions. The Los Angeles City Council designated the house a Historic-Cultural Monument in 2016.

=== Art and exhibitions ===
In 2009, Laaksonen was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame. Some of his original works are at the Leather Archives &amp; Museum in Chicago.

New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art has acquired several examples of Laaksonen&#x27;s artwork for its permanent collection. In 2006, MoMA in New York accepted five Tom of Finland drawings as part of a much larger gift from The Judith Rothschild Foundation. The trustee of The Judith Rothschild Foundation, Harvey S. Shipley Miller, said, &quot;Tom of Finland is one of the five most influential artists of the twentieth century. As an artist he was superb, as an influence he was transcendent.&quot; Hudson, of Feature Inc., New York, placed Tom of Finland&#x27;s work in the collections of Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art and Art Institute of Chicago. His work is also in the public Collections of: The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), Los Angeles, USA; Wäinö Aaltonen Museum of Art; Turku, Finland; University of California Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley (California), USA; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, USA; Kiasma, Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, Finland; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, USA; and Tom of Finland Foundation, Los Angeles, USA.

In 1999, an exhibition took place at the Institut Culturel Finlandais (Finnish Cultural Centre) in Paris.

In 2011 there was a large retrospective exhibition of Laaksonen&#x27;s artwork in Turku, Finland. The exhibition was one of the official events in Turku&#x27;s European Capital of Culture programme.

In 2012, Kulturhuset presented a retrospective, &quot;Tom of Finland&quot;, in Stockholm, Sweden; and Tom of Finland&#x27;s work was in the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation&#x27;s &quot;We the People&quot; in New York City, USA.

In 2013, MOCA presented &quot;Bob Mizer &amp; Tom of Finland&quot; in Los Angeles, USA. The artist&#x27;s work was also seen in &quot;HAPPY BIRTHDAY Galerie Perrotin – 25 years&quot; in Lille, France; Leslie Lohman Museum&#x27;s &quot;Rare and Raw&quot; in New York City, USA; and the Institute of Contemporary Art&#x27;s &quot;Keep Your Timber Limber (Works on Paper)&quot; in London, England.

In 2015, Artists Space presented the exhibition &quot;Tom of Finland: The Pleasure of Play&quot; in New York City, USA. The exhibition was also presented in Kunsthalle Helsinki in 2016, complemented with additional material such as photos from family albums.

In 2020, as part of the 100th birthday celebrations, &quot;Tom of Finland: Love and Liberation&quot; at London&#x27;s House of Illustration showed 40 originals with ephemera emphasizing fashion as an aspect of his work.

===Film===

In 1991, Filmitakomo and Yleisradio produced a documentary film, &quot;Daddy and the Muscle Academy&quot;, directed by Ilppo Pohjola. By the late 1980s, Laaksonen was well known in the gay world, but his &quot;pneumatically muscled, meticulously rendered monster-donged icons of masculinity&quot; received mainstream attention when the film – which includes hundreds of images of his work along with interviews – was released theatrically in Finland, won a Finnish Jussi Award in 1992, and was shown at film festivals and film art houses worldwide. While praising the artwork&#x27;s quality one critic noted the film&#x27;s lauding of Laaksonen as a gay pride icon while ignoring his work&#x27;s &quot;resemblance to both S &amp; M pornography and Fascist art&quot; which she tied to Laaksonen&#x27;s early sexual experiences with German soldiers during World War II.

Filmmaker Wes Hurley credits Tom of Finland as an influence in his work, including his short &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; and his cult comedy musical &quot;Waxie Moon in Fallen Jewel&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; announced in 2013 that Finnish director Dome Karukoski was set to make a biopic of Laaksonen, entitled &quot;Tom of Finland&quot;. Helsinki-filmi produced it and secured exclusive rights. The film, released in February 2017 in Finland, is the first biopic of the artist.

===Stamps===
In September 2014 the Finnish postal service, Itella Posti, published a set of three first class stamps featuring drawings by Laaksonen and in association with the stamps&#x27; release exhibited some of his correspondence at the Finnish Postal Museum. Two of the stamps include portions of an illustration of a nude man sitting between the legs of another man dressed as a police officer; the other depicts nude buttocks with a man&#x27;s face included between the thighs. The stamp set exceeded Posti&#x27;s expectations, with pre-orders from 178 countries, making it the best-selling stamp set in the service&#x27;s history.

<text>In applied linguistics and educational psychology, competency evaluation is a means for teachers to determine the ability of their students in other ways besides the standardized test.

Usually this includes portfolio assessment. In language testing, it may also include student interviews and checklists (e.g., on a scale from 1 to 5 the student or teacher rates his or her ability to do such tasks as introducing one&#x27;s family).

While various governments in Europe and Canada often employ competency evaluation to evaluate bilingual abilities of public employees, it has only recently begun to receive attention from the United States where large testing corporations have dominated language evaluation with financially lucrative performance tests such as the TOEFL, MCAT and SAT tests. In psychology, competency can be evaluation to cover civil affairs, such as competency to handle personal finances, and competency to handle personal affairs (such as signing contracts).

<text>USS &quot;Richard B. Russell&quot; (SSN-687), a attack submarine, has been the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Richard B. Russell, Jr. (1897–1971), United States Senator from Georgia (1933–1971).

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract for &quot;Richard B. Russell&quot;″s construction was awarded on 25 July 1969 and her keel was laid down 19 October 1971 by Newport News Shipbuilding at Newport News, Virginia, authenticated by Mrs. Ina Russell Stacey, sister and official hostess for Senator Russell. &quot;Richard B. Russell&quot; was launched at Newport News on 12 January 1974, sponsored by Mrs. Leila Elizabeth (Betty) Talmadge (née Shingler), wife of Herman E. Talmadge (1913–2002), U.S. Senator from Georgia (1957–1981), and commissioned on 16 August 1975.

==Service history==
In August 1977, &quot;Richard B. Russell&quot; was fitted with a large housing attached to her hull just aft of her sail, containing a tethered antenna buoy that was under development. The housing, called a &quot;bustle&quot; (and particularly the &quot;Russell bustle&quot;), gave her a unique profile and her nickname became &quot;Dickey &quot;B&quot;.&quot; Later submarine classes would have their antenna buoy housings built into their hull fairings.

One point of interest about the fitting of the bustle came about as it was being installed. A crane was used to lift the bustle for the installation process. The crane used had insufficient capacity to lift the bustle. The bustle went into the water, and the crane was pulled onto its side. Two people were pinned under the crane until another barge-mounted crane was brought in to lift the bustle from the water, and right the other crane.

In 1978, &quot;Richard B. Russell&quot; completed a three-month deployment in the North Atlantic Ocean for which she received a Navy Unit Commendation and an Expeditionary Medal.

In 1980, &quot;Richard B. Russell&quot; completed a five-month deployment in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1981 she completed a deployment in the North Atlantic Ocean for which she received a Meritorious Unit Commendation and an Expeditionary Medal.

In 1982, &quot;Richard B. Russell&quot; went through the Panama Canal and arrived at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, for an extended . During her time at Mare Island, it was decided that she would become a special projects submarine. After a short period of post-overhaul testing and sea trials, she underwent extensive ocean engineering modifications prior to commencing operations as a unit of Submarine Development Group 1. As a member of Sub Dev Group 1, she spearheaded a testing program for submarine rescue technology.

&quot;Richard B. Russell&quot;″s role as a fast attack submarine as well as a development and testing platform earned her the Presidential Unit Citation, the highest award any naval unit can be given. She also earned six Navy Unit Commendations, and seven Battle Effectiveness Awards (formerly the Battle Efficiency Award), commonly known as the Battle &quot;E&quot;, during her career.

&quot;Richard B. Russell&quot; was placed in reserve while still in commission on 1 July 1993.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Richard B. Russell&quot; was both decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 June 1994. She was stored at Bremerton, Washington, until 1 October 2001, when she entered the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton for scrapping. Her scrapping was completed on 3 January 2003.

<text>Callen Radcliffe Tjader Jr. ( ; July 16, 1925 – May 5, 1982) was an American Latin Jazz musician, often described as the most successful non-Latino Latin musician. He explored other jazz idioms, especially small group modern jazz, even as he continued to perform music of Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America.

Tjader played the vibraphone primarily, and was accomplished on the drums, bongos, congas, timbales, and the piano. He worked with many musicians from several cultures. He is often linked to the development of Latin rock and acid jazz. Although fusing Jazz with Latin music is often categorized as &quot;Latin Jazz,&quot; Tjader&#x27;s works swung freely between both styles. His Grammy award in 1980 for his album &quot;La Onda Va Bien&quot; capped off a career that spanned over 40 years.

== Early years (1925–1943) ==
Callen Radcliffe Tjader Jr. was born July 16, 1925, in St. Louis to touring Swedish American vaudevillians. His father tap danced and his mother played piano, a husband-wife team going from city to city with their troupe to earn a living. When he was two, Tjader&#x27;s parents settled in San Mateo, California, and opened a dance studio. His mother (who dreamed of becoming a concert pianist) instructed him in classical piano and his father taught him to tap dance. He performed around the Bay Area as &quot;Tjader Junior,&quot; a tap-dancing &quot;wunderkind&quot;. He performed a brief non-speaking role dancing alongside Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson in the film &quot;The White of the Dark Cloud of Joy&quot;.

He joined a Dixieland band and played around the Bay Area. At age sixteen, he entered a Gene Krupa drum solo contest, making it to the finals and ultimately winning by playing &quot;Drum Boogie.&quot; But the win was overshadowed by the attack on Pearl Harbor that morning.

== Navy and college (1940s) ==
Tjader entered the United States Navy in 1943 at age 17 and served as a medical corpsman in the Pacific Theater until March 1946. He saw action in five invasions, including the Marianas campaign and the Battle of the Philippines. Upon his return he enrolled at San Jose State College (now San José State University) under the G.I. Bill, majoring in education. Later he transferred to San Francisco State College, still intending to teach. It was there he took timpani lessons, his only formal music training.

At San Francisco State, he met Dave Brubeck, a young pianist also fresh from a stint in the Army. Brubeck introduced Tjader to Paul Desmond. The three connected with more players and formed the Dave Brubeck Octet with Tjader on drums. Although the group recorded only one album and had difficulty finding work, the recording is regarded as important due to its early glimpse at these soon-to-be-legendary jazz greats. After the octet disbanded, Tjader and Brubeck formed a trio, performing jazz standards in the hope of finding more work. The Dave Brubeck Trio succeeded and became a fixture in the San Francisco jazz scene. Tjader taught himself the vibraphone during this period, alternating between it and the drums depending on the song.

== Sideman (1951–1954) ==
Brubeck suffered major injuries in a diving accident in 1951 in Hawaii and the trio was forced to dissolve. Tjader continued the trio work in California with bassist Jack Weeks from Brubeck&#x27;s trio and pianists John Marabuto or Vince Guaraldi, recording his first 10&quot; LP as a leader with them for Fantasy, but soon worked with Alvino Rey and completed his degree at San Francisco State. Jazz pianist George Shearing recruited Tjader in 1953 when Joe Roland left his group. Al McKibbon was a member of Shearing&#x27;s band at the time and he and Tjader encouraged Shearing to add Cuban percussionists. Tjader played bongos as well as the vibes: &quot;Drum Trouble&quot; was his bongo solo feature. &quot;Down Beat&quot;&#x27;s 1953 Critics Poll nominated him as best New Star on the vibes. His next 10&quot; LP as a leader was recorded for Savoy during that time, as well as his first Latin Jazz for a Fantasy 10&quot; LP. While in New York City, bassist Al McKibbon took Tjader to see the Afro-Cuban big bands led by Machito and Chico O&#x27;Farrill, both at the forefront of the nascent Latin jazz sound. In New York he met Mongo Santamaría and Willie Bobo who were members of Tito Puente&#x27;s orchestra at the time.

== Leader (1954–1962) ==
Tjader soon quit Shearing after a gig at the San Francisco jazz club the Blackhawk. In April 1954, he formed the Cal Tjader Modern Mambo Quintet. The members were brothers Manuel Duran and Carlos Duran on piano and bass respectively, Benny Velarde on timbales, bongos, and congas, and Edgard Rosales on congas (Luis Miranda replaced Rosales after the first year). Back in San Francisco and recording for Fantasy Records, the group produced several albums in rapid succession, including &quot;Mambo with Tjader&quot;.

The Mambo craze reached its pitch in the late 1950s, a boon to Tjader&#x27;s career. Unlike the exotica of Martin Denny and Les Baxter, music billed as &quot;impressions of&quot; Oceania (and other locales), Tjader&#x27;s bands featured seasoned Cuban players and top-notch jazz talent conversant in both idioms. He cut several notable straight-ahead jazz albums for Fantasy using various group names, most notably the Cal Tjader Quartet (composed of bassist Gene Wright, drummer Al Torre, and pianist Vince Guaraldi). Tjader is sometimes lumped in as part of the West Coast (or &quot;cool&quot;) jazz sound, although his rhythms and tempos (both Latin and bebop) had little in common with the work of Los Angeles jazzmen Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, or Art Pepper.

Tjader and his band opened the second Monterey Jazz Festival in 1959 with an acclaimed &quot;preview&quot; concert. The first festival had suffered financially. Tjader is credited with bringing in big ticket sales for the second and saving the landmark festival before it had even really started. The Modern Mambo Quintet disbanded within a couple of years. Tjader formed several more small-combo bands, playing regularly at such San Francisco jazz clubs as the Blackhawk.

== Verve and Skye Records (1960s) ==
After recording for Fantasy for nearly a decade, Tjader signed with better-known Verve Records, founded by Norman Granz but owned then by MGM. With the luxury of larger budgets and seasoned recording producer Creed Taylor in the control booth, Tjader cut a varied string of albums. During the Verve years Tjader worked with arrangers Oliver Nelson, Claus Ogerman, Eddie Palmieri, Lalo Schifrin, Don Sebesky, and performers Willie Bobo, Donald Byrd, Clare Fischer, a young Chick Corea, Jimmy Heath, Kenny Burrell, Hank Jones, Anita O&#x27;Day, Armando Peraza, Jerome Richardson and others. Tjader recorded with big band orchestras for the first time, and even made an album based on Asian scales and rhythms.

His biggest success was the album &quot;Soul Sauce&quot; (1964). Its title track, a Dizzy Gillespie cover Tjader had been toying with for over a decade, was a radio hit (hitting the top 20 on New York&#x27;s influential pop music station WMCA in May 1965), and landed the album on Billboard&#x27;s Top 50 Albums of 1965. Titled &quot;Guachi Guaro&quot; (a nonsensical phrase in Spanish), Tjader transformed the Gillespie/Chano Pozo composition into something new. (The name &quot;Soul Sauce&quot; came from Taylor&#x27;s suggestion for a catchier title and Willie Bobo&#x27;s observation that Tjader&#x27;s version was spicier than the original.) The song&#x27;s identifiable sound is a combination of the call-outs made by Bobo (&quot;Salsa ahi na ma ... sabor, sabor!&quot;) and Tjader&#x27;s crisp vibes work. The album sold over 100,000 copies and popularized the word &quot;salsa&quot; in describing Latin dance music.

The 1960s were Tjader&#x27;s most prolific period. With the backing of a major record label, Verve, he could afford to stretch out and expand his repertoire. The most obvious deviation from his Latin jazz sound was &quot;Several Shades of Jade&quot; (1963) and the follow-up &quot;Breeze From the East&quot; (1963). Both albums attempted to combine jazz and Asian music, much as Tjader and others had done with Afro-Cuban. The result was dismissed by the critics, chided as little more than the dated exotica that had come and gone in the prior decade. Tjader also recorded a notable straight modern jazz live album &quot;Saturday Night/ Sunday Night at the Blackhawk, San Francisco&quot; with his regular quartet in 1962.

Other experiments were not so easily dismissed. Tjader teamed up with New Yorker Eddie Palmieri in 1966 to produce &quot;El Sonido Nuevo&quot; (&quot;The New Sound&quot;). A companion LP was recorded for Palmieri&#x27;s contract label, Tico, titled &quot;Bamboleate&quot;. While Tjader&#x27;s prior work was often dismissed as &quot;Latin lounge&quot;, here the duo created a darker, more sinister sound. &quot;Cal Tjader Plays The Contemporary Music Of Mexico And Brazil&quot; (1962), released during the bossa nova craze, actually bucked the trend, instead using more traditional arrangements from the two countries&#x27; past. In the late 1960s Tjader, along with guitarist Gábor Szabó and Gary McFarland, helped to found the short-lived Skye record label. Tjader&#x27;s work of this period is characterized by &quot;Solar Heat&quot; (1968) and &quot;Tjader Plugs In&quot; (1969), precursors to acid jazz.

== Fusion years (1970s) ==
During the 1970s Tjader returned to Fantasy Records, the label he began with in 1954. Embracing the jazz fusion sound that was becoming its own subgenre at the time, he added electronic instruments to his lineup and began to employ rock beats behind his arrangements. His most notable album during this period is &quot;Amazonas&quot; (1975) (produced by Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira). He played on the soundtrack to the 1972 animated film &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, most notably on the track entitled &quot;Mamblues&quot;. In 1976, Tjader recorded several live shows performed at Grace Cathedral, San Francisco. Like the Monterey Jazz Festival show, he played a mix of jazz standards and Latin arrangements. Later he toured Japan with saxophonist Art Pepper, the latter recovering from alcohol and drug dependencies.

== Final years (1979 to 1982) ==
Carl Jefferson, president of Concord Records, created a subsidiary label called Concord Picante to promote and distribute Tjader&#x27;s work. Unlike his excursions in the 1960s and his jazz-rock attempts in the 1970s, Tjader&#x27;s Concord Picante work was largely straight-ahead Latin jazz. Electronic instruments and rock backbeats were dropped, reverting to a more &quot;classic&quot; sound. During the prior decade he&#x27;d built up a crew of young musicians consisting of Mark Levine on piano, Roger Glenn on flute, Vince Lateano on drums, Robb Fisher on the bass, and Poncho Sanchez on the congas.

Tjader cut five albums for Concord Picante, the most successful being &quot;La Onda Va Bien&quot; (1979) (roughly &quot;The Good Life&quot;), produced by Carl Jefferson and Frank Dorritie, which earned a Grammy award in 1980 for Best Latin Recording. The A section of Tjader&#x27;s &quot;Sabor&quot; is a 2-3 onbeat/offbeat guajeo, minus some notes.
Tjader died on tour. On the road with his band in Manila, he collapsed from the third of a series of heart attacks, and died on May 5, 1982, aged 56. 

== Legacy ==
Tjader&#x27;s legacy is associated with that of Gábor Szabó and Gary McFarland, who worked and founded Skye Records together (the PANDORA archive spells Szabó without the acute accent). The American hip-hop band A Tribe Called Quest sampled Tjader&#x27;s &quot;Aquarius&quot; (from &quot;The Prophet&quot;) as an outro to most of the songs on their album &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;.

According to one estimation, Tjader&#x27;s work has been sampled in 214 tracks.
