<text>The Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (Lithuanian SSR; ; ), also known as Soviet Lithuania or simply Lithuania, was &quot;de facto&quot; one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union between 1940–1941 and 1944–1990. After 1946, its territory and borders mirrored those of today&#x27;s Republic of Lithuania, with the exception of minor adjustments to its border with Belarus.

During World War II, the previously independent Republic of Lithuania was occupied by the Red Army on 16 June 1940, in conformity with the terms of the 23 August 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and established as a puppet state on 21 July. Between 1941 and 1944, the German invasion of the Soviet Union caused its &quot;de facto&quot; dissolution. However, with the retreat of the Germans in 1944–1945, Soviet hegemony was re-established and continued for forty-five years. As a result, many Western countries continued to recognize Lithuania as an independent, sovereign &quot;de jure&quot; state subject to international law, represented by the legations appointed by the pre-1940 Baltic states, which functioned in various places through the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service.

On 18 May 1989, the Lithuanian SSR declared itself to be a sovereign state, though still part of the USSR. On 11 March 1990, the Republic of Lithuania was re-established as an independent state, the first Soviet Republic to leave Moscow and leading other states to do so. Lithuania considered the Soviet occupation and annexation illegal and, like the other two Baltic States, claimed state continuity. This legal continuity has been recognised by most Western powers. The Soviet authorities considered the independence declaration illegal, but after the January Events in Lithuania and failed 1991 Soviet coup attempt in Moscow, the Soviet Union itself recognized Lithuanian independence on 6 September 1991.

==History==

===Background===

On 23 August 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which contained agreements to divide Europe into spheres of influence, with Lithuania falling into Germany&#x27;s sphere of influence. On 28 September 1939, the USSR and Germany signed the Frontier Treaty and its secret protocol, by which Lithuania was placed in the USSR&#x27;s sphere of influence in exchange for Germany gaining an increased share of Polish territory, which had already been occupied. The next day, the USSR offered Lithuania an agreement on the establishment of Soviet military bases in its territory. During the negotiations, the Lithuanian delegation was told of the division of the spheres of influence. The Soviets threatened that if Lithuania refused to host the bases, Vilnius could be annexed to Belarus (at that time the majority of population in Vilnius and Vilnius region were Polish people). In these circumstances a Lithuania–USSR agreement on mutual assistance was signed in Moscow on 10 October 1939, allowing a Soviet military presence in Lithuania. A total of 18,786 Red Army troops were deployed at strategically important locations within the country: Alytus, Prienai, Gaižiūnai, and Naujoji Vilnia. This move effectively ended Lithuanian neutrality and brought it directly under Soviet influence.

===Occupation and annexation===
While Germany was conducting its military campaign in Western Europe in May and June 1940, the USSR invaded the Baltic states. On 14 June 1940, an ultimatum was served to Lithuania on the alleged grounds of abduction of Red Army troops. The ultimatum said Lithuania should remove officials that the USSR found unsuitable (the Minister of the Interior and the Head of the Security Department in particular), replace the government, and allow an unlimited number of Red Army troops to enter the country. The acceptance of the ultimatum would have meant the loss of sovereignty, but Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov declared to diplomat Juozas Urbšys that, whatever the reply may be, &quot;troops will enter Lithuania tomorrow nonetheless&quot;. The ultimatum was a violation of every prior agreement between Lithuania and the USSR and of international law governing the relations of sovereign states.

The last session of the government of the Republic of Lithuania was called to discuss the ultimatum, with most members in favour of accepting it. On 15 June, President Antanas Smetona left for the West, expecting to return when the geopolitical situation changed, leaving Prime Minister Antanas Merkys in Lithuania. Before his departure, Smetona transferred most presidential duties to Merkys. Under the constitution, the prime minister became acting president whenever the president was unable to carry out his duties.
Meanwhile, the 8th and 11th armies of the USSR, comprising a total of 15 divisions, crossed the border. Flying squads took over the airports of Kaunas, Radviliškis, and Šiauliai. Regiments of the Red Army disarmed the Lithuanian military, took over its assets, and supported local communists. On 16 June, Merkys announced in a national radio broadcast that he had deposed Smetona, and was now president in his own right. On 17 June, the cabinet resolved that Smetona had effectively abandoned his post by leaving the country and confirmed Merkys as president without any qualifiers.
Later that day, under pressure from Moscow, on 17 June 1940, Merkys appointed Justas Paleckis prime minister and resigned soon after. Paleckis then assumed presidential duties, and Vincas Krėvė was appointed prime minister. The Communist Party was legalized again and began publication of its papers and staging meetings to support the new government. Opposition organizations and newspapers were outlawed, and ties abroad cut. On 14–15 July, elections took place for a &quot;People&#x27;s Seimas.&quot; The only contender was the Union of the Working People of Lithuania, a front for the Communists. Citizens were mandated to vote, and the results of the elections were likely falsified. At its first meeting on 21 July, the new People&#x27;s Seimas declared that the Lithuanian people desired to join the Soviet Union. Accordingly, it unanimously changed Lithuania&#x27;s official name to the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (LSSR) and formally petitioned to join the Soviet Union as a constituent republic. Resolutions to start the country&#x27;s Sovietisation were passed the same day. On 3 August, a Lithuanian delegation of prominent public figures was dispatched to Moscow to sign the document by which Lithuania acceded to the USSR. After the signing, Lithuania was annexed to the USSR. On 25 August 1940, an extraordinary session of the People&#x27;s Seimas reorganized itself as the provisional Supreme Soviet of the LSSR, ratified the Constitution of the LSSR, which in form and substance was similar to the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union.

===German invasion and the second Soviet occupation===

On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the USSR and occupied all of Lithuania within a month. The Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), a resistance organisation founded in Berlin and led by Kazys Škirpa whose goal was to liberate Lithuania and re-establish its independence, cooperated with the Nazis. The LAF was responsible for killing many Lithuanian Jews (during the first days of the Holocaust in Lithuania). Škirpa was named prime minister in the Provisional Government of Lithuania; however, the Germans placed him under house arrest and dissolved the LAF on 5 August 1941. During the German occupation, Lithuania was made part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland. Between July and October 1944, the Red Army entered Lithuania once again, and the second Soviet government began. The first post-war elections took place in the winter of 1946 to elect 35 representatives to the LSSR Supreme Council. The results were again likely falsified to show an attendance rate of at over 90% and to establish an absolute victory for Communist Party candidates. The LSSR Supreme Council under Paleckis was formally the supreme governmental authority; in reality, power was in the hands of the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, a post held by Antanas Sniečkus until 1974.

===Red Army crimes===

Upon recapturing Lithuania from the retreating Germans in 1944, the Red Army immediately began committing war crimes. The situation was so extreme that even Sniečkus complained to Lavrentiy Beria on 23 July that &quot;If such robbery and violence continues in Kaunas, this will burst our last sympathy for the Red Army&quot;. Beria passed this complaint on to Joseph Stalin.

In a special report on the situation in the Klaipėda Region, the head of the local NKGB operational group wrote that:
In the same report, the mass rape of Lithuanian women in the Klaipėda and Šilutė regions was reported:
In Klaipėda Lithuanian men aged 17 to 48 were arrested and deported. In December 1944, Chief of the Priekulė KGB Kazakov wrote to the LSSR Minister of the Interior Josifas Bertašiūnas that due to the soldiers&#x27; violence most of the houses in Priekulė were unsuitable for living in: windows were knocked out, fireplaces disassembled, furniture and agricultural inventory broken up and exported as scrap. Many Red Army soldiers engaged in robbery, rape, and murder, and Lithuanians who saw soldiers at night would often run from their homes and hide.

Other regions of the LSSR also suffered heavily. For example, on 26 December 1944, Kaunas&#x27; NKGB representative Rodionov wrote to the USSR and LSSR Ministers of the Interior that due to the violence and mass arrests by the counterintelligence units of SMERSH, many Kaunas inhabitants were forced into crime. Eleven SMERSH subdivisions did not obey any orders, not even those from the NKGB. Chief of the Vilnius Garrison, P. Vetrov, in his order described discipline violations: on 18 August a soldier went fishing with explosives in the Neris river; on 19 August a fifteen-minute firefight took place between the garrison soldiers and prison guards; on 22 August drunk officers shot at each other. On 1 October 1944, Chief of the Kaunas NKVD G. Svečnikov reported that on the night of 19 October two aviation unit soldiers killed the Mavraušaitis family during a burglary. On 17 January 1945, Chairman of the Alytus Executive Committee requested the LSSR People&#x27;s Commissars Council to withdraw the border guards unit, which was sent to fight the Lithuanian partisans, because it was burning not only the enemy&#x27;s homes and farms, but also those of innocent people. They were also robbing local inhabitants cattle and other property.

===Sovietisation===
The Sovietisation of Lithuania began with the strengthening of the supervision of the Communist Party. Officials were sent from Moscow to set up bodies of local governance. They were exclusively Lithuanian, with trustworthy Russian specialists for assistants – it was these who were in effective control. By the spring of 1945, 6,100 Russian-speaking workers had been sent to Lithuania. When the Soviets reoccupied the territory, Lithuanians were deprived of all property except personal belongings. This was followed by collectivisation, which started in 1947, with people being forced to join kolkhozes. Well-off farmers would be exiled, and the livestock of the peasants from the surrounding areas would be herded to their properties. Since kolkhozes had to donate a large portion of their produce to the state, the people working there lived in poorer conditions than the rest of the nation. Their pay would often be delayed and made in kind and their movement to cities was restricted. This collectivisation ended in 1953.

Lithuania became home to factories and power plants, in a bid to integrate the country into the economic system of the USSR. The output of major factories would be exported from the republic as there was a lack of local demand. This process of industrialisation was followed by urbanisation, as villages for the workers had to be established or expanded in the vicinity of the new factories, resulting in new towns such as Baltoji Vokė, Naujoji Akmenė, Elektrėnai and Sniečkus or expansion of old ones such as Jonava. Residents would be relocated from elsewhere in the LSSR, and from other USSR republics. By 1979, more than half of population lived in urban areas.

All symbols of the former Republic of Lithuania were removed from public view by 1950, and the country had its history rewritten and its achievements belittled. The veneration of Stalin was spread and the role of Russia and the USSR in the history of Lithuania was highlighted. People were encouraged to join the Communist Party and communist organisations. Science and art based on communist ideology and their expression controlled by censorship mechanisms. People were encouraged into atheism in an attempt to secularise Lithuania, with monasteries closed, religion classes prohibited and church-goers persecuted.

===Armed resistance===
The second Soviet occupation was followed by armed resistance in 1944–1953, aiming to restore an independent Lithuania, re-establish capitalism and eradicate communism, and bring back national identity and freedom of faith. Partisans were labelled bandits by the Soviets. They were forced into the woods and into armed resistance by the Soviet rule. Armed skirmishes with the Red Army were common between 1944 and 1946. From the summer of 1946 a partisan organisational structure was established, with units of 5–15 partisans living in bunkers. Guerrilla warfare with surprise attacks was the preferred tactic. In 1949 the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters under Jonas Žemaitis–Vytautas was founded. Partisan units became smaller still, consisting of 3 to 5 partisans. Open fighting was a rarity, with sabotage and terrorism preferred. Despite guerrilla warfare failing to achieve its objectives and claiming the lives of more than 20,000 fighters, it demonstrated to the world that Lithuania&#x27;s joining the USSR had not been a voluntary act and highlighted the desire of many Lithuanians to be independent.

===Deportations===
In the fall of 1944, lists of &#x27;bandits&#x27; and &#x27;bandit family&#x27; members to be deported appeared. Deportees were marshaled and put on a USSR-bound trains in Kaunas in early May 1945, reaching their destination in Tajikistan in summer. Once there, they employed as forced labour at cotton plantations. In May 1945, a new wave of deportations from every county took place, enforced by battlegroups made of NKVD and NKGB staff and NKVD troops – the destruction battalions, or &quot;istrebitels&quot;. On 18–21 February 1946, deportations began in four counties: Alytus, Marijampolė, Lazdijai, and Tauragė.

On 12 December 1947 the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party resolved that actions against supporters of resistance were too weak and that additional measures were in order. A new series of deportations began and 2,782 people were deported in December. In January–February 1948, another 1,134 persons were exiled from every county in Lithuania. By May 1948, the total number of deportees had risen to 13,304. In May 1948, preparations for very large-scale deportations were being made, with 30,118 staff members from Soviet organisations involved. On 22–23 May 1948, a large-scale deportation operation called &quot;Vesna&quot; began, leading to 36,932 arrests, a figure that later increased to 40,002.

The second major mass deportation, known as Operation Priboi, took place on 25–28 March 1949, during which the authorities put 28,981 persons into livestock cars and dispatched them deep into the USSR. Some people went into hiding and managed to escape the deportations, but then a manhunt began in April. As a result, another two echelons left for the remote regions of the USSR. During March–April 1949, a total of some 32,000 people were deported from Lithuania. By 1952, 10 more operations had been staged, but of a smaller scale. The last deportations took place in 1953, when people were deported to the district of Tomsk and the regions of Altai and Krasnoyarsk.

===Dissident movement===

Even after the guerrilla resistance had been quelled, Soviet authorities failed to suppress the movement for Lithuania&#x27;s independence. Underground dissident groups had been active from the 1950s, publishing periodicals and Catholic literature. They fostered national culture, celebrated historical events, instigated patriotism and encouraged hopes for independence. In the 1970s, dissidents established the Lithuanian Liberty League under Antanas Terleckas. Founded in Vilnius in the wake of an international conference in Helsinki, Finland, which recognised the borders established after the Second World War, the Lithuanian Helsinki Group demanded that Lithuania&#x27;s occupation be recognised as illegal and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact be condemned. The dissidents ensured that the world would receive information about the situation in the LSSR and human rights violations, which caused Moscow to soften the regime. In 1972, young Romas Kalanta immolated himself in Kaunas in a public display of protest against the regime. This was followed by public unrest, demonstrating that a large portion of the population were against the regime.

The Catholic Church took an active part in opposing the Soviets. The clergy published chronicles of the Catholic Church of Lithuania, secretly distributed in Lithuania and abroad. The faithful would gather in small groups to teach their children religion, celebrate religious holidays, and use national and religious symbols. The most active repressed figures of the movement were Vincentas Sladkevičius, Sigitas Tamkevičius, and Nijolė Sadūnaitė.

===Collapse of Soviet rule===

In the 1980s, the USSR sank into a deep economic crisis. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev was elected head of the USSR&#x27;s Communist party and undertook internal reforms which had the effect of liberalising society (whilst actually increasing the economic chaos) and a new approach to foreign policy that effectively ended the Cold War. This encouraged the activity of anti-communist movements within the USSR, the LSSR included. On 23 August 1987, the Lithuanian Liberty League initiated an unsanctioned meeting in front of the monument to Adomas Mickevičius in Vilnius. At the meeting, the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact was condemned for the first time in public. The meeting and the speeches made at it were widely reported by western radio stations. Also meeting was reported by Central Television and even TV Vilnius.

In May 1987, the Lithuanian Cultural Fund was established to engage in environmental activity and the protection of Lithuanian cultural assets. On 3 June 1988, the Lithuanian Reformation Movement (LRM) was founded; its mission was to restore the statehood of Lithuania; LRM supporters formed groups across Lithuania. On 23 August 1988, a meeting took place at Vingis Park in Vilnius, with a turnout of about 250,000 people. On 23 August 1989, marking 50 years of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and aiming to draw the world&#x27;s attention to the occupation of the Baltic states, the Baltic Way event was staged. Organised by the Lithuanian Reformation Movement, the Baltic Way was a chain of people holding hands that stretched for nearly to connect the three Baltic capitals of Vilnius, Riga, and Tallinn. It was a display of the aspiration of the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian people to part ways with the USSR. The LSSR &quot;de facto&quot; ceased to exist on 11 March 1990, with the Reconstituent Seimas declaring Lithuania&#x27;s independence restored. It took the line that since Lithuania&#x27;s membership in the USSR was a violation of international law, it was reasserting an independence that still legally existed. Therefore, the Reconstituent Seimas argued that Lithuania did not need to follow the formal procedure of secession from the USSR.

===Independence restored===

Lithuania declared the sovereignty of its territory on 18 May 1989 and declared independence from the Soviet Union on 11 March 1990 under its pre-1940 name, the Republic of Lithuania. Lithuania was the first Baltic state to assert state continuity, and the first Soviet Republic to declare full independence from the Union (though Estonia was the first Soviet Republic to assert its national sovereignty and the supremacy of its national laws over the laws of the Soviet Union). All of the Soviet Union&#x27;s claims on Lithuania were repudiated as Lithuania declared the restitution of its independence. The Soviet Union claimed that this declaration was illegal, as Lithuania had to follow the process of secession mandated in the Soviet Constitution if it wanted to leave.

Lithuania contended that it did not need to follow the process of secession because the entire process by which Lithuania joined the Soviet Union violated both Lithuanian and international law. Specifically, it contended that Smetona never resigned, making Merkys&#x27; takeover of the presidency illegal and unconstitutional. Therefore, Lithuania argued that all acts leading up to the Soviet takeover were &quot;ipso facto&quot; null and void, and it was simply reasserting an independence that still existed under international law.

The Soviet Union threatened to invade, but the Russian SFSR&#x27;s declaration of sovereignty on 12 June meant that the Soviet Union could not enforce Lithuania&#x27;s retention. While other republics held the union-wide referendum in March to restructure the Soviet Union in a loose form, Lithuania, along with Estonia, Latvia, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova did not take part. Lithuania held an independence referendum earlier that month, with 93.2% voting for it.
Iceland immediately recognised Lithuania&#x27;s independence. Other countries followed suit after the failed coup in August, with the State Council of the Soviet Union recognising Lithuania&#x27;s independence on 6 September 1991. The Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December 1991.

It was agreed that the Soviet Army (later the Russian Army) must leave Lithuania because it was stationed without any legal reason. Its troops withdrew in 1993.

==Politics==
===First secretaries of the Communist Party of Lithuania===
The first secretaries of the Communist Party of Lithuania were:
* Antanas Sniečkus, 1940–1941; 1944–1974
* Petras Griškevičius, 1974–1987
* Ringaudas Songaila, 1987–1988
* Algirdas Brazauskas, 1988–1989

==Economy==
Collectivization in the Lithuanian SSR took place between 1947 and 1952.
The 1990 per capita GDP of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was $8,591, which was above the average for the rest of the Soviet Union of $6,871. This was half or less of the per capita GDPs of adjacent countries Norway ($18,470), Sweden ($17,680) and Finland ($16,868). Overall, in the Eastern Bloc, systems without competition or market-clearing prices became costly and unsustainable, especially with the increasing complexity of world economics. Such systems, which required party-state planning at all levels, collapsed under the weight of accumulated economic inefficiencies, with various attempts at reform merely contributing to the acceleration of crisis-generating tendencies.

Lithuania accounted for 0.3 percent of the Soviet Union&#x27;s territory and 1.3 percent of its population, but it generated a significant amount of the Soviet Union&#x27;s industrial and agricultural output: 22 percent of its electric welding apparatus, 11.1 percent of its metal-cutting lathes, 2.3 percent of its mineral fertilizers, 4.8 percent of its alternating current electric motors, 2.0 percent of its paper, 2.4 percent of its furniture, 5.2 percent of its socks, 3.5 percent of underwear and knitwear, 1.4 percent of leather footwear, 5.3 percent of household refrigerators, 6.5 percent of television sets, 3.7 percent of meat, 4.7 percent of butter, 1.8 percent of canned products, and 1.9 percent of sugar.

Lithuania was also a net donor to the USSR budget. It was calculated in 1995 that the occupation resulted in 80 billion LTL (more than 23 billion euros) worth of losses, including population, military, and church property losses and economic destruction among other things. Lithuania mostly suffered until 1958 when more than a half of the annual national budgets was sent to the USSR budgets, later this number decreased but still remained high at around 25% of the annual national budgets until 1973 (totally, Lithuania sent about one third of all its annual national budgets money to the USSR budgets during the whole occupation period).

==In astronomy==
A minor planet, 2577 Litva, discovered in 1975 by a Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh is named after the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.

<text>The Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, also commonly known as Soviet Tajikistan, the Tajik SSR, TaSSR, or simply Tajikistan, was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union which existed from 1929 to 1991 in Central Asia.

The Tajik Republic was created on 5 December 1929 as a national entity for the Tajik people within the Soviet Union. It succeeded the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik SSR), which had been created on 14 October 1924 as a part of the predominantly Turkic Uzbek SSR in the process of national delimitation in Soviet Central Asia. On 24 August 1990, the Tajik SSR declared sovereignty in its borders. The republic was renamed the [[Republic of Tajikistan]] on 31 August 1991 and declared its independence from the disintegrating Soviet Union on 9 September 1991; thus modern Tajikistan is its direct legal successor state.

Geographically, at , it was bordered by Afghanistan to the south, China to the east, Pakistan to the south, separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor, as well as internally by fellow Soviet republics of Uzbekistan to the west, Kyrgyzstan to the north. Notably, the Tajik SSR was the only republic of the Soviet Union to be separated from the Russian SFSR by more than one other republic.

== Nomenclature ==
The name Tajik refers to the name of a pre-Islamic tribe that existed before the seventh century A.D. Based on the Library of Congress&#x27;s 1997 Country Study of Tajikistan, it is difficult to definitively state the origins of the word &quot;Tajik&quot; citing due to its &quot;embroiled in twentieth-century political disputes about whether Turkic or Iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of Central Asia.&quot;

The name of the country was often spelt &quot;Tadzhikistan&quot; in the English language during Soviet times due to it being borrowed directly from the Russian spelling &quot;Таджикистан&quot;, where the letters &#x27;дж&#x27; produce a &#x27;j&#x27; sound.

== History ==

One of the new states created in the process of national delimitation of Soviet Central Asia in October 1924 was the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic – Uzbek SSR or Soviet Uzbekistan. Soviet Tajikistan was created at the same time within the predominantly Turkic Uzbek SSR as an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik ASSR) – one rank below a Soviet Socialist Republic in USSR geopolitical hierarchy. The new autonomous republic included what had been eastern Bukhara and had a population of about 740,000, out of a total population of nearly 5 million in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic as a whole. Its capital was established in Dyushambe, which had been a village of 3,000 in 1920. In December 1929, Tajik ASSR was detached from the Uzbek SSR and given full status as a Soviet Socialist Republic – &quot;Tajik Socialist Soviet Republic&quot;. At that time, its capital was renamed &quot;Stalinabad&quot;, after Joseph Stalin, and the territory that is now northern Tajikistan (Sughd Province) was added to the new republic. Even with the additional territory, the Tajik SSR remained the smallest Central Asian republic. On 5 December 1936, it was renamed the &quot;Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;.

With the creation of a Tajik republic defined in national terms came the creation of institutions that, at least in form, were likewise national. The first Tajik-language newspaper in Soviet Tajikistan began publication in 1926. New educational institutions also began operation at about the same time. The first state schools, available to both children and adults and designed to provide basic education, opened in 1926. The central government also trained a small number of Tajiks for public office, either by putting them through courses offered by government departments or by sending them to schools in the Uzbek SSR.

Under Soviet rule, Tajikistan experienced some economic and social progress. However, living standards in the republic were still among the lowest in the Union. Most people still lived in rural &quot;qishlaqs&quot;, settlements that were composed of 200 to 700 one-family houses built along a waterway.

After Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953, Stalinabad was renamed &quot;Dushanbe&quot; on 10 November 1961 as part of the de-Stalinization program.

In February 1990, riots occurred in the republic&#x27;s capital Dushanbe. 26 people died and 565 more were injured and the Soviet troops put down the riots. Yaqub Salimov, a future Interior Minister, and some youth activists were convicted for participation in the riots.

Later on 24 August 1990, Tajik SSR declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws. By 1991, Tajikistan participated in a referendum in March as part of the attempt to preserve the union with a turnout of 96.85%. However, this did not happen when hardliners took control of Moscow during the next three days in August. After the failure of the coup, the Tajik SSR was renamed the Republic of Tajikistan on 31 August 1991. On 9 September 1991, Tajikistan seceded from the Soviet Union months before the country itself ceased to exist on 26 December 1991. Conflicts after independence caused a civil war throughout the country over the next six years.

==Politics==
Tajikistan, like all other republics in the Soviet Union, was officially a Soviet republic governed by the Tajik republican branch within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in all organs of government, politics and society. The Supreme Soviet was a unicameral legislature of the republic headed by a Chairman, with its superiority to both the executive and judicial branches and its members convened in the Supreme Soviet building in Dushanbe. Since independence in 1991, it retained the unicameral structure before being replaced by a bicameral system in 1999 using the presidential system. The republic&#x27;s government structure was similar to those of other republics.

==Military==

Tajikistan was the only Central Asian Republic to not form an army under the Soviet Armed Forces. In replacement were the Soviet units under the Ministry of Defence, as well as troops who were subordinates of the Turkestan Military District and the Central Asian Military District in neighboring Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan respectively. In the early 1990s the army was the smallest in the union and had more Russians than native Tajiks in it. The army failed to effectively defend the regime as proven in the 1990 Dushanbe riots. There was a large contingent of Soviet border guards who were commanded by Russians based from Moscow who commanded ethnic Tajik conscripts. When the TurkVO was dissolved in June 1992, its personnel were distributed between Tajikistan and the other 4 Central Asian republics.

The Tajik SSR also operated its own Ministry of Internal Affairs and Internal Troops, which was an independent republican affiliate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union.

==Economy==

===Industry===
The light and food industries accounted for over 60% of industrial output. The main branches of heavy industry were electric power, mining, non-ferrous metallurgy, machine building, metalworking, and the building materials industry. The basis of the electricity accounted for HPP. Mining activities concentrated on the extraction of brown coal and oil and natural gas. Non-ferrous metals industries included an aluminum plant in Tursunzade and a hydrometallurgical plant in Isfara. The engineering sector had its hub at Dushanbe and produced winding, agricultural machinery, equipment for trading enterprises and public catering, textiles, lighting and wiring equipment, transformers, household refrigerators, and cables, among other products. Chemical industrial plants included one for nitrogen fertilizer in Kurgan-Tube, electrochemical products in Yovon, and plastics in Dushanbe. The main branches of light industry were cotton ginning, silk, and carpet weaving. The food industry consisted partially of the fruit-canning, vegetable oils, and fat industries.

===Agriculture===
In 1986, there were 299 state-owned and 157 collective farms in the country. Designated agricultural land amounted to 4.2 million hectares (10 million acres).

Due to the large irrigation works in the area of irrigated land 1986 have reached 662 thousand hectares. Agriculture gave about 65% of gross agricultural output. The leading branch of agriculture was cotton (cotton collection 922 thousand tons in 1986), developed in Fergana, Vakhsh, Hissar valleys. Tajikistan was the main base of the country for the production of long-staple cotton. Cultured and tobacco, geranium, linen - Kudryashov, sesame. Approximately 20% of crops were occupied by grain crops (gross grain harvest - 246 thousand tons in 1986 in.). They grow vegetables and melons.

<text>The Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (, ), also known as Soviet Uzbekistan, the Uzbek SSR, UzSSR, or simply Uzbekistan and rarely Uzbekia, was a union republic of the Soviet Union. It was governed by the Uzbek branch of the Soviet Communist Party, the legal political party, from 1925 until 1990. From 1990 to 1991, it was a sovereign part of the Soviet Union with its own legislation.

Beginning 20 June 1990, the Uzbek SSR adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty within its borders. Islam Karimov became the republic&#x27;s inaugural president.

On 31 August 1991, the Uzbek SSR was renamed the [[Republic of Uzbekistan]] and declared independence three months before the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution on 26 December 1991.

Uzbekistan was bordered by Kazakhstan to the north; Tajikistan to the southeast; Kirghizia to the northeast; Afghanistan to the south; and Turkmenistan to the southwest.

== Name ==
The name, Uzbekistan, literally means &quot;Home of the Free&quot;, taken from an amalgamation of &quot;uz&quot; (Turkic: &quot;self&quot;), &quot;bek&quot; (Turkic: &quot;master&quot;), and &quot;-stan&quot; (Persian: &quot;land of&quot;). However, the official name of the republic was the &quot;Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic&quot; as defined by its 1937 and 1978 Constitutions.

== History ==

In 1924, the borders of political units in Central Asia were changed along ethnic lines determined by Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Commissar for Nationalities, Joseph Stalin. The Turkestan ASSR, the Bukharan People&#x27;s Soviet Republic, and the Khorezm People&#x27;s Soviet Republic were abolished and their territories were eventually divided into five separate Soviet Socialist Republics, one of which was the &quot;Uzbek Socialist Soviet Republic&quot;, created on 27 October 1924. The next year Uzbekistan became one of the republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union). In 1928, the collectivization of land into state farms was initiated, which lasted until the late 1930s.

Uzbekistan included the Tajik ASSR until 1929, when the Tajik ASSR was upgraded to an equal status. In 1930, the Uzbek SSR capital was relocated from Samarkand to Tashkent, which remained the capital since. In 1936, Uzbekistan was enlarged with the addition of the Karakalpak ASSR taken from the Kazakh SSR in the last stages of the national delimitation in the Soviet Union. That same year in December, it was renamed to the &quot;Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;. Further bits and pieces of territory were transferred several times between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan after World War II.

In 1937–38, during the Great Purge, a number of alleged nationalists were executed, including Faizullah Khojaev, the first prime minister.
During World War II, many industries were relocated to Uzbekistan from vulnerable locations in western regions of the USSR to keep them safe. Large numbers of Russians, Ukrainians and other nationalities accompanied the factories, altering the demographics of the republic. The demographics situation was further aggravated by Stalin&#x27;s forced deportation of some ethnic groups suspected of collaboration with the Axis powers (including Nazi Germany) from other parts of the Soviet Union to Uzbekistan. This included large numbers of ethnic Koreans, Crimean Tatars, and Chechens.

During the Soviet period, Islam became a focal point for the anti-religious drives of Communist authorities. The government closed most mosques, and religious schools became anti-religious museums. The Soviet period also achieved virtual elimination of illiteracy, even in rural areas. Only a small percentage of the population was literate before 1917; this percentage increased to nearly 100 percent under the Soviets.

Another major development, one with future catastrophic impact, was the drive initiated in the early 1960s to substantially increase cotton production in the republic. This drive led to overzealous irrigation withdrawals of irrigation water from the Amu Darya and the subsequent Aral Sea ecological disaster.

Towards the end of the Soviet–Afghan War, several troops crossed the Uzbek border from Afghanistan as part of the Soviet withdrawal on 15 February 1989. During the war Afghan mujahideen sponsored by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence also crossed the border to commit sabotage operations. 

The Communist Party was the only legal party in the Uzbek SSR until 1990. The first secretary, or head, of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan was consistently an Uzbek. Long-time leader of the Uzbek SSR was Sharof Rashidov, head of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan from 1959 to 1983. Islam Karimov, leader of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan since 1989 and subsequently head of that party&#x27;s reincarnation, the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP), became president of the Uzbek SSR in 1990. On 20 June 1990, the Supreme Soviet adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Uzbek SSR, which took over the laws of the Soviet Union days after the Russian SFSR adopted theirs.

===Independence===
The Uzbek SSR participated in the referendum in March 1991 as a part of the proposed Union of Soviet Sovereign States. This never came to pass after unsuccessful coup attempt events between 19 and 21 August 1991 in Moscow. In the aftermath, the Uzbek SSR was renamed the Republic of Uzbekistan and declared its independence on 31 August 1991, with the Soviet Union dissolving on 26 December 1991. After independence, the 1978 Constitution remained in use. The referendum was confirmed on 29 December 1991.

==Politics==
Uzbekistan, akin to the rest of the Soviet republics, was defined by a single-party socialist republic framework, whereby the First Secretary of the Central Committee was the head of the party, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet as the head of state and the Chairmen of the Council of Ministers served as the head of government in a one-party system led by the CPSU&#x27;s republican branch, the Communist Party of Uzbekistan. Executive power was exercised by the government and the legislative power was vested in Supreme Soviet where it met for sessions in Tashkent.

==Military==

Uzbekistan had the strongest Soviet Armed Forces presence of the other Central Asian Republics. Almost all of its troops were personnel of the Turkestan Military District (TurkVO), which was based in Tashkent. Personnel from the TurkVO were distributed between the military of Uzbekistan, as well as the militaries of the other four Central Asian republics when it was dissolved in June 1992. At independence, ethnic Russians filled the ranks of the newly created armed forces, and made up most of the officer corps.

The Uzbek SSR operated its own domestic Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) independent of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union, of which it was a republican affiliate organization.

==Economy==

Uzbekistan had an industrial sector including electric power generation, engineering, and chemical production.

Uzbekistan&#x27;s energy came from large thermal power plants, including those at Syrdarya, Angren, Tashkent and others. There was also a hydroelectric component to the economy, including the Charvak, Hodzhikentskaya, Gazalkent and Farkhad hydroelectric plants, among others.

The natural gas industry was of importance to the economy of the republic. The Gazly deposits and other and Kashkadarya (Mubarak, Shurtan) area contributed to this industry. Uzbekistan also produced oil (Fergana valley, Bukhara and Surkhandarya region). In terms of minerals, there was production of lead and zinc, tungsten, molybdenum, copper ores (found in the Karamazarskaya group of deposits), and gold (found in the Navoi region, Jizzakh region, and others).

Chemical manufacturing included the production of mineral fertilizers (nitrogen and phosphorus) for cotton (in Chirchik, Kokand, Samarkand, Fergana, Almalyk, and Navoi); the manufacture of chemical fibers (in Fergana); plastics (in Fergana and Namangan), rubber products, household chemicals, and more. Petrochemical, chemical and pharmaceutical, and the microbiological industry were all present in some form.

Some of the engineering sector included: agriculture (machinery for the mechanization of cotton cultivation, cotton harvesters, etc.), production of tractors, equipment for the cotton and textile industry, construction and road machines, electrical engineering; aviation, electronic and instrument-making, chemical and petroleum engineering. Some companies also produced cement, asbestos-cement pipes, slate, and ceramics.

Some of the light industry present in Uzbekistan included the primary processing of cotton, silk cocoons, wool, fiber crops, raw hides, and karakul pelts. Cotton and silk textiles, footwear, garments, and carpets were all produced in Uzbekistan.

The food industry produced oil and fat - mainly oil production from cotton seeds, tinned vegetables, butter and cheese, milk, and meat.

<text>Flyktningerennet is a cross country ski race, running from Lierne, Norway to Gäddede, Sweden. The ski race follows this route in remembrance of the people who fled Nazi German-occupied Norway for Sweden during the Second World War.

The first race was arranged in 1950, with H. Hemmingsson as winner. The first female Flyktningerenn was arranged in 1964.

<text>In mathematics and logic, an operation is finitary if it has finite arity, i.e. if it has a finite number of input values. Similarly, an infinitary operation is one with an infinite number of input values. 

In standard mathematics, an operation is finitary by definition. Therefore, these terms are usually only used in the context of infinitary logic.

== Finitary argument ==
A finitary argument is one which can be translated into a finite set of symbolic propositions starting from a finite set of axioms. In other words, it is a proof (including all assumptions) that can be written on a large enough sheet of paper.

By contrast, infinitary logic studies logics that allow infinitely long statements and proofs. In such a logic, one can regard the existential quantifier, for instance, as derived from an infinitary disjunction.

== History ==
Logicians in the early 20th century aimed to solve the problem of foundations, such as, &quot;What is the true base of mathematics?&quot; The program was to be able to rewrite all mathematics using an entirely syntactical language &quot;without semantics&quot;. In the words of David Hilbert (referring to geometry), &quot;it does not matter if we call the things &quot;chairs&quot;, &quot;tables&quot; and &quot;beer mugs&quot; or &quot;points&quot;, &quot;lines&quot; and &quot;planes&quot;.&quot;

The stress on finiteness came from the idea that human &quot;mathematical&quot; thought is based on a finite number of principles and all the reasonings follow essentially one rule: the &quot;modus ponens&quot;. The project was to fix a finite number of symbols (essentially the numerals 1, 2, 3, ... the letters of alphabet and some special symbols like &quot;+&quot;, &quot;⇒&quot;, &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, etc.), give a finite number of propositions expressed in those symbols, which were to be taken as &quot;foundations&quot; (the axioms), and some rules of inference which would model the way humans make conclusions. From these, &quot;regardless of the semantic interpretation of the symbols&quot; the remaining theorems should follow &quot;formally&quot; using only the stated rules (which make mathematics look like a &quot;game with symbols&quot; more than a &quot;science&quot;) without the need to rely on ingenuity. The hope was to prove that from these axioms and rules &quot;all&quot; the theorems of mathematics could be deduced. That aim is known as logicism.

<text>Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois (; 12 October 1671 – 12 July 1749) was a French Naval officer who served as Governor of New France from 1726 to 1746.

== Biography ==
Son of François IV de Beauharnais, Charles had two brothers who also impacted the history of New France. Claude de Beauharnois was a French Naval officer who spent time commanding ships that maintained supply lines to the colony and François de Beauharnois was intendant of New France for a time.

The governor worked well with frontier traders, explorers, and missionaries. His term saw a great expansion in the number of western forts with the leadership of people like La Vérendrye, and the linkage of Canadian and Louisiana colonies. Exploration was pushed west to the Rocky Mountains by La Vérendrye and his sons.

Despite a generally peaceful and prosperous administration, he was blamed for the fall of Fortress Louisbourg in 1745, and was recalled in 1746, returning to France to following year.

Beauharnais was one of three governors-general of Canada known to have owned enslaved people. During his tenure, he owned 27 people, among them two Africans and a number of Meskwaki and Inuit.

==Legacy==
Many places carry his name including the town of Beauharnois, Quebec and Fort Beauharnois, Minnesota.

<doc id="404466" wikidata="Q134712" url="?curid=404466" title="Šiauliai">
<text>Šiauliai ( ; ) is a city in northern Lithuania, the country&#x27;s fourth largest city and the sixth largest city in the Baltic States, with a population of 112 581 in 2024. From 1994 to 2010 it was the capital of Šiauliai County.

==Names==
Šiauliai is referred to by various names in different languages: Samogitian ; Latvian (historic) and (modern); Polish ; German ; Belarusian ; Russian (historic) and (modern); Yiddish .

==History==

The city was first mentioned in written sources as &quot;Soule&quot; in Livonian Order chronicles describing the Battle of Saule. Thus the city&#x27;s founding date is now considered to be 22 September 1236, the same date when the battle took place, not far from Šiauliai. At first, it developed as a defence post against the raids by the Teutonic and Livonian Orders. After the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, the raids stopped and Šiauliai started to develop as an agricultural settlement. In 1445, a wooden church was built. It was replaced in 1625 with the brick church which can be seen in the city center today.

Šiauliai was granted Magdeburg city rights in the 16th century when it also became an administrative centre of the area. However, in the 16th to 18th centuries the city was devastated by The Deluge and epidemics of the Bubonic plague.

The credit for the city&#x27;s rebirth goes to Antoni Tyzenhaus (1733–1785) who after a violent revolt of peasants of the Crown properties in Northern Lithuania (so-called in Polish: Powstanie Szawelskie, 1769), started the radical economic and urban reforms. He decided to rebuild the city according to the Classicism ideas: at first houses were built randomly in a radial shape, but Tyzenhaus decided to build the city in an orderly rectangular grid. Šiauliai grew to become a well-developed city, with several prominent brick buildings. In 1791 Stanisław August Poniatowski, king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, confirmed once again that Šiauliai&#x27;s city rights and granted it a coat of arms which depicted a bear, the symbol of Samogitia, the Eye of Providence, and a red bull, the symbol of the Poniatowski family. The modern coat of arms has been modelled after this version.

After the Partitions of Poland, Šiauliai received a new coat of arms. The city grew and became an important educational and cultural centre. Also, infrastructure was rapidly developing: in 1836–1858 a road connecting Riga and Tilsit was built, in 1871 a railroad connecting Liepāja with Romny was built. Šiauliai, being in a crossroad of important merchant routes, started to develop as an industrial town. Already in 1897, it was the third-largest city in Lithuania with a population of about 16,000. The demographics changed also: 56.4% of the inhabitants were Jewish in 1909. Šiauliai was known for its leather industry. Chaim Frenkel owned the biggest leather factory in the Russian Empire.

===World War I and independent Lithuania===

During World War I, about 85% of the buildings were burned down and the city centre was destroyed. After the war and re-establishment of Lithuania, the importance of Šiauliai grew. Before Klaipėda was attached to Lithuania, the city was second after Kaunas by population size. By 1929 the city centre was rebuilt. Modern utilities were also included: streets were lighted and there was public transportation, telephone and telegraph lines, water supply network and sewer.

The first years of independence were difficult because the industrial city lost its markets in Russia. It needed to find new clients in Western Europe. In 1932, a railroad to Klaipėda was built and it connected the city to the Western markets. In 1938, the city produced about 85% of Lithuania&#x27;s leather, 60% of footwear, 75% of flax fibre and 35% of candies. Culture also flourished as many new periodicals were printed, new schools and universities opened, a library, theatre, museum, and conventional school opened.

===World War II===
In 1939, one-fifth of the city&#x27;s population was Jewish. German soldiers entered Šiauliai on June 26, 1941. The first mass murder of Šiauliai Jews was perpetrated in the Kužiai forest, about 12 kilometres outside Šiauliai, on June 29, 1941. According to one of the Jewish survivors of Šiauliai, Nesse Godin, some 700 people were shot in nearby woods during the first weeks of occupation after having been forced to dig their own graves. Beginning on July 29, 1941, and continuing throughout the summer, the Germans murdered about 8,000 Jews from Šiauliai and the Šiauliai region in the Kužiai forest. One hundred twenty-five Jews from Linkuva were also murdered there, along with ethnic Lithuanian and Russian members of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth.

The Šiauliai Ghetto was established in July 1941. There were two Jewish ghetto areas in Šiauliai, one in the Kaukas suburb, and one in Trakų. During World War II, the Jewish population was reduced from 8,000 to 500. Approximately 80% of the buildings were destroyed.

===Soviet era===

The city was largely rebuilt anew in a typical Soviet fashion during the years of subsequent Soviet occupation.

<text>William &quot;Sputnik&quot; Spooner (born August 16, 1949) is a musician, guitarist, singer and songwriter, and the founder of The Tubes, a theatrical rock band. His songwriting is known for its use of humor and satire. He has released three solo albums: &quot;First Chud&quot; (1985), &quot;Mall to Mars&quot; (1997), and &quot;Demo-licious&quot;. He previously played in the San Francisco Bay area with the band The Folk Ups, and now plays as a solo artiste or in sessions with his son Boone. He is still recording.

== Biography and music career ==
Spooner was born and raised in Arizona with a few years spent in Lubbock, Texas. His family later moved back to Arizona, to Phoenix, where he began to play guitar. His first band was the XLs, a Beatles cover band. A band he started subsequently, the Beans, moved to San Francisco in 1970. Shortly after arriving the Beans merged with another group, the Red, White and Blues Band, to become the Tubes. He was guitarist, vocalist and principal songwriter for this group, known for their theatrical stage performances. The Tubes became a successful local and eventually nationally known band, and had a series of bestselling albums and hit singles in the late 1970s and early 80s.

&quot;I was writing songs to illustrate outrageous characters concocted by Michael Cotten, Prairie Prince and myself. I was (am) really surprised some people consider these songs (&quot;White Punks on Dope,&quot; &quot;Mondo Bondage,&quot; &quot;What Do You Want From Life?&quot;) classics. I&#x27;m not complaining...just mystified...&quot; states Spooner.

Spooner left the Tubes for their temporary disbanding in 1985 and subsequently released his debut solo album, &quot;First Chud&quot;. After rejoining when the Tubes regrouped shortly thereafter, he would again leave the group in 1989.

Spooner then experimented with several bands, including the Sponge Mummies a satirical anti-environmental group, and SNAFU, a &quot;paramilitary&quot; rock band. Neither was very successful, although he began writing again during this period. Some of the songs appeared on the 1996 release &quot;Mall to Mars&quot; originally released on Visible Records, then on RDK Records. The record had outer space as a theme.

In 1998 Spooner teamed up with Alex Guinness to form the acoustic rock-folk group The Folk-Ups. They later added upright bassist Mark Skowronek. They now perform at Bay Area clubs such as Slim&#x27;s, Noe Valley Ministry, Cafe Amsterdam, and the Sweetwater. The Folk-Ups have opened for Dave Davies of The Kinks and Freedy Johnston.

==Personal life==
Spooner is married to Anna. Spooner&#x27;s son, Boone Spooner, is a music producer, engineer, songwriter and drummer. His daughter, Nicole Spooner, is a registered nurse and professional dog walker.

<doc id="404489" wikidata="Q185231" url="?curid=404489" title="Elephant seal">
<text>Elephant seals or sea elephants are very large, oceangoing earless seals in the genus Mirounga. Both species, the northern elephant seal (&quot;M. angustirostris&quot;) and the southern elephant seal (&quot;M. leonina&quot;), were hunted to the brink of extinction for lamp oil by the end of the 19th century, but their numbers have since recovered. They can weigh up to . Despite their name, elephant seals are not closely related to elephants, and the large proboscis or trunk that males of the species possess is an example of convergent evolution. 

The northern elephant seal, somewhat smaller than its southern relative, ranges over the Pacific coast of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The most northerly breeding location on the Pacific Coast is at Race Rocks Marine Protected Area, at the southern tip of Vancouver Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The southern elephant seal is found in the Southern Hemisphere on islands such as South Georgia and Macquarie Island, and on the coasts of New Zealand, Tasmania, South Africa, and Argentina in the Peninsula Valdés. In southern Chile, there is a small colony of 120 animals at Jackson Bay (&quot;Bahía Jackson&quot;) in Admiralty Sound (&quot;Seno Almirantazgo&quot;) on the southern coast of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego.

The oldest known unambiguous elephant seal fossils are fragmentary fossils of a member of the tribe Miroungini described from the late Pliocene Petane Formation of New Zealand. Teeth originally identified as representing an unnamed species of &quot;Mirounga&quot; have been found in South Africa, and dated to the Miocene epoch; however, Boessenecker and Churchill (2016) considered these teeth almost certainly to be misidentified toothed whale (odontocete) teeth. The elephant seals evolved in the Pacific Ocean during the Pliocene period.

Elephant seals breed annually and are seemingly habitual to colonies that have established breeding areas.

==Taxonomy==
John Edward Gray established the genus &quot;Mirounga&quot; in 1827. The generic name &quot;Mirounga&quot; is a Latinization of &quot;miouroung&quot;, which is said to have been a term for the seal in an Australian Aboriginal language. However, it is not known which language this represents.

==Description==
Elephant seals are marine mammals classified under the order Pinnipedia, which, in Latin, means feather- or fin-footed. Elephant seals are considered true seals, and fall under the family Phocidae. Phocids (true seals) are characterized by having no external ear and reduced limbs. The reduction of their limbs helps them be more streamlined and move easily in the water. However, it makes navigating on land more difficult because they cannot turn their hind flippers forward to walk like the otariids. In addition, the hind flippers of elephant seals have a lot of surface area, which helps propel them in the water. 

Elephant seals spend the majority of their life (90%) underwater in search of food, and can cover a day when they head out to sea. When elephant seals are born, they can weigh up to and reach lengths up to . Sexual dimorphism is extreme, with male elephant seals weighing up to 10 times more than females, and having a prominent proboscis. 

Elephant seals take their name from the large proboscis of the adult male (bull), reminiscent of an elephant&#x27;s trunk, and considered a secondary sexual characteristic. The bull&#x27;s proboscis is used in producing extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially during the mating season. More importantly, however, the nose acts as a sort of rebreather, filled with cavities that reabsorb moisture from their exhalations. This is important during the mating season when the seals do not leave the beach to feed, and must conserve body moisture as there is no incoming source of water. 

They are very much larger than other pinnipeds, with southern elephant seal bulls typically reaching a length of and a weight of , and are much larger than the adult females (cows), with some exceptionally large males reaching up to in length and weighing ; cows typically measure about and . Northern elephant seal bulls reach a length of and the heaviest weigh about .

The northern and southern elephant seal can be distinguished by various external features. On average, the southern elephant seal tends to be larger than the northern species. Adult male elephant seals belonging to the northern species tend to have a larger proboscis, and thick chest area with a red coloration compared to the southern species. Females do not have the large proboscis and can be distinguished between species by looking at their nose characteristics. Southern females tend to have a smaller, blunt nose compared to northern females.

==Extant species distributions==



==Physiology==

Elephant seals spend up to 80% of their lives in the ocean. They can hold their breath for more than 100 minutes – longer than any other noncetacean mammal. Elephant seals dive to beneath the ocean&#x27;s surface (the deepest recorded dive of an elephant seal is by a southern elephant seal, while the record for the northern elephant seal is ). The average depth of their dives is about , typically for around 20 minutes for females and 60 minutes for males, as they search for their favorite foods, which are skates, rays, squid, octopuses, eels, small sharks and large fish. Their stomachs also often contain gastroliths. They spend only brief amounts of time at the surface to rest between dives (2–3 minutes). Females tend to dive a bit deeper due to their prey source.
Elephant seals are shielded from extreme cold more by their blubber than by fur. Their hair and outer layers of skin molt in large patches. The skin has to be regrown by blood vessels reaching through the blubber. When molting occurs, the seal is susceptible to the cold, and must rest on land, in a safe place called a &quot;haul out&quot;. Northern males and young adults haul out during June to July to molt; northern females and immature seals during April to May.

Elephant seals have a very large volume of blood, allowing them to hold a large amount of oxygen for use when diving. They have large sinuses in their abdomens to hold blood and can also store oxygen in their muscles with increased myoglobin concentrations in muscle. In addition, they have a larger proportion of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. These adaptations allow elephant seals to dive to such depths and remain underwater for up to two hours.

Unlike some other marine mammals, such as dolphins, elephant seals do not have unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. Instead they sleep deeply for a little less than 20 minutes at the time while sinking through the water to depths that has been measured to 377 meters. When being near the continental shelf, where the ocean is less deep, they will often reach bottom, which sometimes wakes them up. But more often they continue to sleep on the seabed. On average, they get about two hours of sleep a day over a period of seven months, which is among the lowest amount of sleep of any mammal.

They are able to slow down their heartbeat (bradycardia) and divert blood flow from the external areas of the body to important core organs. They can also slow down their metabolism while performing deep dives.

Elephant seals have a helpful feature in their bodies known as the countercurrent heat exchanger to help conserve energy and prevent heat loss. In this system, arteries and veins are organized in a way to maintain a constant body temperature by having the cool blood flowing to the heart warmed by blood going to external areas of the animal.

Milk produced by elephant seals is remarkably high in milkfat compared to other mammals. After an initially lower state, it rises to over 50% milkfat (human breast milk is about 4% milkfat, and cow milk is about 3.5% milkfat).

== Adaptations ==
Elephant seals have large circular eyes that have more rods than cones to help them see in low light conditions when they are diving. These seals also possess a structure called the tapetum lucidum, which helps their vision by having light reflected back to the retina to allow more chances for photoreceptors to detect light.

Their body is covered in blubber, which helps them keep warm and reduce drag while they are swimming. The shape of their body also helps them maneuver well in the water, but limits their movement on land. Also, elephant seals have the ability to fast for long periods of time while breeding or molting. The turbinate process, another unique adaptation, is very beneficial when these seals are fasting, breeding, molting, or hauling out. This unique nasal structure recycles moisture when they breathe and helps prevent water loss.

Elephant seals have external whiskers called &quot;vibrissae&quot; to help them locate prey and navigate their environment. The vibrissae are connected to blood vessels, nerves, and muscles making them an important sensing tool.

Due to evolutionary changes, their ear has been modified to work extremely well underwater. The structure of the inner ear helps amplify incoming sounds, and allows these seals to have good directional hearing due to the isolation of the inner ear. In addition to these adaptations, tissues in the ear canal allow the pressure in the ear to be adjusted while these seals perform their deep dives.

== Breeding season ==
Males arrive at potential breeding sites in spring, and fast to ensure that they can mate with as many females as possible. Male elephant seals use fighting, vocalisations, and different positions to determine the dominant males. By the time males reach eight to nine years of age, they have developed a pronounced long nose, in addition to a chest shield, which is thickened skin in their chest area. They display their dominance by showing their noses, making loud vocalisations, and altering their postures. They fight each other by raising themselves and ramming each other with their chests and teeth.

By the time females arrive, each dominating male has already established his territory on the beach. Females cluster in groups called harems, which consist of up to 50 females surrounding one alpha male. Outside of these groups, a beta bull is normally roaming around on the beach. The beta bull helps the alpha by preventing other males accessing the females. In return, the beta bull might have an opportunity to mate with one of the females while the alpha is occupied.

Birth on average only takes a few minutes, and the mother and pup have a connection due to each other&#x27;s unique smell and sound. The mothers will fast and nurse up to 28 days, providing their pups with rich milk. The last two to three days, however, females will be ready to mate, and the dominant males will pounce on the opportunity. Males and females lose up to a third of their body weight during the breeding season. The gestation period for females is 11 months, and the pupping seasons lasts from mid to late summer. The new pups will spend up to 10 additional weeks on land learning how to swim and dive.

==Life history==
The average lifespan of a northern elephant seal is 9 years, while the average lifespan of a southern elephant seal is 21 years. Males reach maturity at five to six years, but generally do not achieve alpha status until the age of eight, with the prime breeding years being between ages 9 and 12. The longest life expectancy of a male northern elephant seal is approximately 14 years.

Females begin breeding at age 3–6, and have one pup per breeding attempt. Most adult females breed each year. Breeding success is much lower for first-time mothers relative to experienced breeders. Annual survival probability of adult females is 0.83 for experienced breeding females, but only 0.66 for first-time breeders indicating a significant cost of reproduction. More male pups are produced than female pups in years with warmer sea surface temperature in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.

Females and males utilize different feeding strategies in order to maximize their reproductive success. Males feed in benthic regions with more abundant food sources, but also more abundant predators. Females feed in pelagic regions where they are less likely to find prey, but also less likely to be preyed upon. They employ these different strategies because females are smaller, requiring less food, and it is also most important for them to have as many breeding seasons as possible in order to maximize reproductive success. On the other hand, males can adopt a riskier strategy in the hopes of gaining as much mass as possible, and thus being able to have one extremely successful breeding season.

== Molting ==

Once a year, elephant seals go through a process called molting where they shed the outer layer of hair and skin. This molting process takes up to a month to complete. When it comes time to molt, they will haul out on land to shed their outer layer, and will not consume any food during this time. The females and juveniles will molt first, followed by the sub adult males, and finally the large mature males.

== Predators ==
The main predators of elephant seals are killer whales and great white sharks. Cookiecutter sharks can take bites from their skin.

===Milk stealing===
Sheathbills, Skuas, Western Gulls, and African feral cats have been reported to steal milk from the elephant seals&#x27; teats.

==Status==
The IUCN lists both species of elephant seal as being of least concern, although they are still threatened by entanglement in marine debris, fishery interactions, and boat collisions. Though a complete population count of elephant seals is not possible because all age classes are not ashore at the same time, a 2005 study of the California breeding stock estimated approximately 124,000 individuals. The animal is protected in most countries where it lives. In Mexico, the northern elephant seal is protected in the Guadalupe Island Biosphere Reserve where it was rediscovered after being believed to be extinct.

<text>Roger Hugh Williams, CBE (born 22 January 1948) is a Welsh Liberal Democrat politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Brecon and Radnorshire from 2001 to 2015.

==Early life==
Born in the town of Crickhowell, Williams studied at Christ College, Brecon, and Selwyn College, Cambridge. On graduating in Natural Sciences he returned to Breconshire becoming a livestock farmer on the family farm at Llanfilo. During the mid-1980s he was elected Chairman of the Brecon and Radnorshire branch of the National Farmers Union.

==Political career==
Williams joined the Labour Party in 1969, but left to join the SDP at the formation of the party in 1981, representing it and subsequently the Liberal Democrats on Powys County Council. In 1990, he was elected Chairman of Brecon Beacons National Park. At the 1999 Welsh Assembly election Williams contested Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire but finished a distant fifth. He stood down from Powys Council in 2001.

In 2001, he was elected to represent the constituency of Brecon &amp; Radnorshire, subsequently holding the seat with a majority of 751 following the retirement of fellow Liberal Democrat Richard Livsey. At the 2005 election, Williams was returned with an improved majority of 3,905. He served as Shadow Welsh Secretary in the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team in the 2005-10 Parliament and was re-elected at the 2010 election with a majority of 3,747.

Williams was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Years Honours List for public and political service.

In 2017, he rejoined Powys County Council, winning the seat of Felin-fach, serving until 2022.

==Personal life==
He married Penelope James in 1973 in Devon. They have a son (born 1975) and daughter (born 1976). They also have four Grandchildren, one of which is Theo Williams/

<doc id="404504" wikidata="Q312739" url="?curid=404504" title="Irving Fisher">
<text>Irving Fisher (February 27, 1867 – April 29, 1947) was an American economist, statistician, inventor, eugenicist and progressive social campaigner. He was one of the earliest American neoclassical economists, though his later work on debt deflation has been embraced by the post-Keynesian school. Joseph Schumpeter described him as &quot;the greatest economist the United States has ever produced&quot;, an assessment later repeated by James Tobin and Milton Friedman.

Fisher made important contributions to utility theory and general equilibrium. He was also a pioneer in the rigorous study of intertemporal choice in markets, which led him to develop a theory of capital and interest rates. His research on the quantity theory of money inaugurated the school of macroeconomic thought known as &quot;monetarism&quot;. Fisher was also a pioneer of econometrics, including the development of index numbers. Some concepts named after him include the Fisher equation, the Fisher hypothesis, the international Fisher effect, the Fisher separation theorem and Fisher market.

Fisher was perhaps the first celebrity economist, but his reputation during his lifetime was irreparably harmed by his public statement, just nine days before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, that the stock market had reached &quot;a permanently high plateau&quot;. His subsequent theory of debt deflation as an explanation of the Great Depression, as well as his advocacy of full-reserve banking and alternative currencies, were largely ignored in favor of the work of John Maynard Keynes. Fisher&#x27;s reputation has since recovered in academic economics, particularly after his theoretical models were rediscovered in the late 1960s to the 1970s, a period of increasing reliance on mathematical models within the field. Interest in him has also grown in the public due to an increased interest in debt deflation after the Great Recession.

Fisher was one of the foremost proponents of the full-reserve banking, which he advocated as one of the authors of A Program for Monetary Reform where the general proposal is outlined.

==Biography==
Fisher was born in Saugerties, New York. His father was a teacher and a Congregational minister, who raised his son to believe he must be a useful member of society. Despite being raised in religious family, he later on became an atheist. As a child, he had remarkable mathematical ability and a flair for invention. A week after he was admitted to Yale College his father died, at age 53. Irving then supported his mother, brother, and himself, mainly by tutoring. He graduated first in his class with a BA degree in 1888, having also been elected as a member of the Skull and Bones society.

In 1891, Fisher received the first PhD in economics granted by Yale. His faculty advisors were the theoretical physicist Willard Gibbs and the sociologist William Graham Sumner. As a student, Fisher had shown particular talent and inclination for mathematics, but he found that economics offered greater scope for his ambition and social concerns. His thesis, published by Yale in 1892 as &quot;Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices&quot;, was a rigorous development of the theory of general equilibrium. He based his mathematical theory on analogies with classical mechanics, providing a concordance table between mechanics and economics and visual mechanistic models of the workings of economic markets. When he began writing the thesis, Fisher had not been aware that Léon Walras and his continental European disciples had already covered similar ground. Nonetheless, Fisher&#x27;s work was a very significant contribution and was immediately recognized and praised as first-rate by such European masters as Francis Edgeworth.

After graduating from Yale, Fisher studied in Berlin and Paris. From 1890 onward, he remained at Yale, first as a tutor, then after 1898 as a professor of political economy, and after 1935 as professor emeritus. He edited the &quot;Yale Review&quot; from 1896 to 1910 and was active in many learned societies, institutes, and welfare organizations. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1912. He was president of the American Economic Association in 1918. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1927. The American Mathematical Society selected him as its Gibbs Lecturer for 1929. A leading early proponent of econometrics, in 1930 he founded, with Ragnar Frisch and Charles F. Roos the Econometric Society, of which he was the first president.

Fisher was a prolific writer, producing journalism as well as technical books and articles, and addressing various social issues surrounding World War I, the prosperous 1920s and the depressed 1930s. He made several practical inventions, the most notable of which was an &quot;index visible filing system&quot; which he patented in 1913 and sold to Kardex Rand (later Remington Rand) in 1925. This, and his subsequent stock investments, made him a wealthy man until his personal finances were badly hit by the Crash of 1929.

Fisher was also an active social and health campaigner, as well as an advocate of vegetarianism, prohibition, and eugenics. In 1893, he married Margaret Hazard, a granddaughter of Rhode Island industrialist and social reformer Rowland G. Hazard. He died of inoperable colon cancer in New York City in 1947, at the age of 80.

==Economic theories==

=== Utility theory ===
James Tobin, writing on the contributions of John Bates Clark and Irving Fisher to neoclassical theory in America argues that American economists contributed in their own way to the preparation of a common ground after the neoclassical revolution. In particular Clark and Irving Fisher &quot;brought neoclassical theory into American journals, classrooms, and textbooks, and its analytical tools into the kits of researchers and practitioners.&quot; Already in his doctoral thesis, &quot;Fisher expounds thoroughly the mathematics of utility functions and their maximization, and he is careful to allow for corner solutions.&quot; Already then, Fisher &quot;states clearly that neither interpersonally comparable utility nor cardinal utility for each individual is necessary to the determination of equilibrium.&quot;

In reviewing the history of utility theory, economist George Stigler wrote that Fisher&#x27;s doctoral thesis had been &quot;brilliant&quot; and stressed that it contained &quot;the first careful examination of the measurability of the utility function and its relevance to demand theory.&quot; While his published work exhibited an unusual degree of mathematical sophistication for an economist of his day, Fisher always sought to bring his analysis to life and to present his theories as lucidly as possible. For instance, to complement the arguments in his doctoral thesis, he built an elaborate hydraulic machine with pumps and levers, allowing him to demonstrate visually how the equilibrium prices in the market adjusted in response to changes in supply or demand.

===Interest and capital===

Fisher is probably best remembered today in neoclassical economics for his theory of capital, investment, and interest rates, first exposited in his &quot;The Nature of Capital and Income&quot; (1906) and elaborated on in &quot;The Rate of Interest&quot; (1907). His 1930 treatise, &quot;The Theory of Interest&quot;, summed up a lifetime&#x27;s research into capital, capital budgeting, credit markets, and the factors (including inflation) that determine interest rates.

Fisher saw that subjective economic value is not only a function of the amount of goods and services owned or exchanged, but also of the moment in time when they are purchased with money. A good available now has a different value than the same good available at a later date; value has a time as well as a quantity dimension. The relative price of goods available at a future date, in terms of goods sacrificed now, is measured by the interest rate. Fisher made free use of the standard diagrams used to teach undergraduate economics but labeled the axes &quot;consumption now&quot; and &quot;consumption next period&quot; (instead of the usual schematic alternatives of &quot;apples&quot; and &quot;oranges&quot;). The resulting theory, one of considerable power and insight, was presented in detail in &quot;The Theory of Interest&quot;.

This model, later generalized to the case of &quot;K&quot; goods and &quot;N&quot; periods (including the case of infinitely many periods) has become a standard theory of capital and interest, and is described in Gravelle and Rees, and Aliprantis, Brown, and Burkinshaw. This theoretical advance is explained in Hirshleifer.

Fisher saw that his theory, via economic policy, was making an impact on society as a whole. Once he brought out his Quantity Theory of Money, it started to bring economic models to life. One of the strongest points that Fisher brings out in discussing interest rates was the power of impatience.

===Monetary economics===
Fisher&#x27;s research into the basic theory of prices and interest rates did not touch directly on the great social issues of the day. On the other hand, his monetary economics &quot;did&quot; and this grew to be the main focus of Fisher&#x27;s mature work.

It was Fisher who (following the pioneering work of Simon Newcomb) formulated the quantity theory of money in terms of the &quot;equation of exchange:&quot; Let &quot;M&quot; be the total stock of money, &quot;P&quot; the price level, &quot;T&quot; the number of transactions carried out using money, and &quot;V&quot; the velocity of circulation of money, so that:

:formula_1

Later economists replaced &quot;T&quot; by the real output &quot;Y&quot; (or &quot;Q&quot;), usually quantified by the real Gross domestic product (GDP).

Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Appreciation and Interest&quot; was an abstract analysis of the behavior of interest rates when the price level is changing. It emphasized the distinction between real and nominal interest rates:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the real interest rate, formula_4 is the nominal interest rate, and the inflation formula_5 is a measure of the increase in the price level. When inflation is sufficiently low, the real interest rate can be approximated as the nominal interest rate minus the expected inflation rate. The resulting equation is known as the Fisher equation in his honor.

Fisher believed that investors and savers – people in general – were afflicted in varying degrees by &quot;money illusion&quot;; they could not see past the money to the goods the money could buy. In an ideal world, changes in the price level would have no effect on production or employment. In the actual world with money illusion, inflation (and deflation) did serious harm. For more than forty years, Fisher elaborated his vision of the damaging &quot;dance of the dollar&quot; and devised various schemes to &quot;stabilize&quot; money, i.e. to stabilize the price level. He was one of the first to subject macroeconomic data, including the money stock, interest rates, and the price level, to statistical analyses and tests. In the 1920s, he introduced the technique later called distributed lags. In 1973, the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; posthumously reprinted his 1926 paper on the statistical relation between unemployment and inflation, retitling it as &quot;I discovered the Phillips curve&quot;. Index numbers played an important role in his monetary theory. Bert M. Balk called his book &quot;The Making of Index Numbers&quot; &quot;still impressive&quot; in 2012.

Fisher&#x27;s main intellectual rival was the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Fisher espoused a more succinct explanation of the quantity theory of money, resting it almost exclusively on long run prices. Wicksell&#x27;s theory was considerably more complicated, beginning with interest rates in a system of changes in the real economy. Although both economists concluded from their theories that at the heart of the business cycle (and economic crisis) was government monetary policy, their disagreement would not be solved in their lifetimes, and indeed, it was inherited by the policy debates between the Keynesians and monetarists beginning a half-century later.

===Debt-deflation===

Following the stock market crash of 1929, and in light of the ensuing Great Depression, Fisher developed a theory of economic crises called debt-deflation, which attributed the crises to the bursting of a credit bubble. Initially, during the upswing over-confident economic agents are lured by the prospect of high profits to increase their debt in order to leverage their gains. According to Fisher, once the credit bubble bursts, this unleashes a series of effects that have serious negative impact on the real economy:
# Debt liquidation and distress selling.
# Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off.
# A fall in the level of asset prices.
# A still greater fall in the net worth of businesses, precipitating bankruptcies.
# A fall in profits.
# A reduction in output, in trade and in employment.
# Pessimism and loss of confidence.
# Hoarding of money.
# A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation-adjusted interest rates.

Crucially, as debtors try to liquidate or pay off their nominal debt, the fall of prices caused by this defeats the very attempt to reduce the real burden of debt. Thus, while repayment reduces the amount of money owed, this does not happen fast enough since the real value of the dollar now rises (&#x27;swelling of the dollar&#x27;).

This theory was largely ignored in favor of Keynesian economics, in part because of the damage to Fisher&#x27;s reputation caused by his public optimism about the stock market, just prior to the crash. Debt-deflation has experienced a revival of mainstream interest since the 1980s, and particularly with the Late-2000s recession. Steve Keen predicted the 2008 recession by using Hyman Minsky&#x27;s further development of Fisher&#x27;s work on debt-deflation. Debt-deflation is now the major theory with which Fisher&#x27;s name is associated.

==Stock market crash of 1929==
The stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression cost Fisher much of his personal wealth and academic reputation. He famously predicted, nine days before the crash, that stock prices had &quot;reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.&quot; Irving Fisher stated on October 21 that the market was &quot;only shaking out of the lunatic fringe&quot; and went on to explain why he felt the prices still had not caught up with their real value and should go much higher. On Wednesday, October 23, he announced in a banker&#x27;s meeting &quot;security values in most instances were not inflated.&quot; For months after the Crash, he continued to assure investors that a recovery was just around the corner. Once the Great Depression was in full force, he did warn that the ongoing drastic deflation was the cause of the disastrous cascading insolvencies then plaguing the American economy because deflation increased the real value of debts fixed in dollar terms. Fisher was so discredited by his 1929 pronouncements and by the failure of a firm he had started that few people took notice of his &quot;debt-deflation&quot; analysis of the Depression. People instead eagerly turned to the ideas of Keynes. Fisher&#x27;s debt-deflation scenario has since seen a revival since the 1980s.

==Constructive Income Taxation==
Lawrence Lokken, the University of Miami School of Law professor of economics, credits

Fisher&#x27;s 1942 book with the concept behind the Unlimited Savings Accumulation Tax, a reform introduced in the United States Senate in 1995 by Senator Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico), former Senator Sam Nunn (D-Georgia), and Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Nebraska). The concept was that unnecessary spending (which is hard to define in a law) can be taxed by taxing income minus all net investments and savings, and minus an allowance for essential purchases, thus making funds available for investment.

== Social and health campaigns ==

In 1898, Fisher was diagnosed with tuberculosis, the same disease that had killed his father. He spent three years in sanatoria, finally making a full recovery. That experience sparked in him a vocation as a health campaigner. He was one of the founders of the Life Extension Institute, under whose auspices he co-authored the bestselling book &quot;How to Live: Rules for Healthful Living Based on Modern Science&quot;, published in 1915. He advocated regular exercise and the avoidance of red meat, tobacco, and alcohol. In 1924, Fisher wrote an anti-smoking article for the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, which argued that &quot;tobacco lowers the whole tone of the body and decreases its vital power and resistance ... [it] acts like a narcotic poison, like opium and like alcohol, though usually in a less degree&quot;.

Fisher supported the legal prohibition of alcohol and wrote three booklets defending prohibition in the United States on grounds of public health and economic productivity. As a proponent of Eugenics he helped found the Race Betterment Foundation in 1906. He also defended eugenics, serving in the scientific advisory board of the Eugenics Record Office and as first president of the American Eugenics Society.

When his daughter Margaret was diagnosed with schizophrenia, Fisher had her treated at the New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton, whose director was the psychiatrist Henry Cotton. Cotton believed in a &quot;focal sepsis&quot; theory, according to which mental illness resulted from infectious material in the roots of teeth, bowel recesses, and other places in the body. Cotton also claimed that surgical removal of the infected tissue could alleviate the patient&#x27;s mental disorder. At Trenton, Margaret Fisher had sections of her bowel and colon removed, which eventually resulted in her death. Irving Fisher nonetheless remained convinced of the validity of Cotton&#x27;s treatment.

<text>A peace treaty is an agreement between two or more hostile parties, usually countries or governments, which formally ends a state of war between the parties. It is different from an armistice, which is an agreement to stop hostilities; a surrender, in which an army agrees to give up arms; or a ceasefire or truce, in which the parties may agree to temporarily or permanently stop fighting. 

The need for a peace treaty in modern diplomacy arises from the fact that even when a war is actually over and fighting has ceased, the legal state of war is not automatically terminated upon the end of actual fighting and the belligerent parties are still legally defined as enemies. This is evident from the definition of a &quot;state of war&quot; as &quot;a legal state created and ended by official declaration regardless of actual armed hostilities and usually characterized by operation of the rules of war&quot;. As a result, even when hostilities are over, a peace treaty is required for the former belligerents in order to reach agreement on all issues involved in transition to legal state of peace. The art of negotiating a peace treaty in the modern era has been referred to by legal scholar Christine Bell as the , with a peace treaty potentially contributing to the legal framework governing the post conflict period, or .

Since 1950, the rate at which interstate wars end with a formal peace treaty has substantially declined.

==Elements of treaties==
The content of a treaty usually depends on the nature of the conflict being concluded. In the case of large conflicts between numerous parties, international treaty covering all issues or separate treaties signed between each party.

There are many possible issues that may be included in a peace treaty such as the following:

* Formal designation of borders
* Processes for resolving future disputes
* Access to and apportioning of resources
* Status of refugees
* Status of prisoners of war
* Settling of existing debts
* Defining of as unjust behavior
* The re-application of existing treaties
* Revenge 

In modern history, certain intractable conflict situations may be brought to a ceasefire before they are dealt with via a peace process in which a number of discrete steps are taken on each side to reach the mutually-desired eventual goal of peace and the signing of a treaty.

==Role of the United Nations==
Since its founding after World War II the United Nations has sought to act as a forum for resolution in matters of international conflict. A number of international treaties and obligations are involved in which member states seek to limit and control behavior during wartime. The action of declaring war is now very unlikely to be undertaken.

===Peace treaty under the United Nations===
Since the end of World War II, United Nations Charter Article 2 restricts the use of military force. The UN Charter allows only two exceptions: &quot;military measures by UN Security Council resolutions&quot; and &quot;exercise of self-defense&quot; in countries subjected to armed attacks in relation to the use of force by states. Under the current UN system, war is triggered only by the enforcement of military measures under UN Security Council resolutions or the exercise of self-defense rights against illegal armed attacks.

Therefore, if the use of military force arises, it is called &#x27;international armed conflict&#x27; instead of &#x27;war&#x27;. The fact that the current international law system avoids the use of the term &#x27;war&#x27; also avoids the conclusion of a peace treaty based on the existence of war. A peace treaty was not signed after the end of the Iraq War in 2003, and only the UN Security Council Resolution 1483, adopted on May 22, 2003, stipulated the postwar regime for the stability and security of Iraq exclusively.

=== Post-conflict elections ===
One of the UN&#x27;s roles in peace processes is to conduct post-conflict elections but, on the whole, they are thought to have no effect, or even a negative effect, on peace after civil war.

However, when peace agreements transform rebel groups into political parties, the effect on peace is positive, especially if international interveners use their moments of power distribution to hold the former combatants to the terms of their peace agreement.

==Historic peace treaties==

===Ancient history===
Probably the earliest recorded peace treaty, although it is rarely mentioned or remembered, was between the Hittite Empire and the Hayasa-Azzi confederation, around 1350 BC. More famously, one of the earliest recorded peace treaties was concluded between the Hittite and the Egyptian Empires after 1274 BC Battle of Kadesh (see Egyptian-Hittite peace treaty). The battle took place in what is modern-day Syria, the entire Levant being at that time contested between the two empires. After an extremely costly four-day battle, in which neither side gained a substantial advantage, both sides claimed victory. The lack of resolution led to further conflict between Egypt and the Hittites, with Ramesses II capturing the city of Kadesh and Amurru in his 8th year as king. However, the prospect of further protracted conflict between the two states eventually persuaded both their rulers, Hatusiliš III and Ramesses, to end their dispute and sign a peace treaty. Neither side could afford the possibility of a longer conflict since they were threatened by other enemies: Egypt was faced with the task of defending its long western border with Libya against the incursion of Libyan tribesmen by building a chain of fortresses stretching from Mersa Matruh to Rakotis, and the Hittites faced a more formidable threat in the form of the Assyrian Empire, which &quot;had conquered Hanigalbat, the heartland of Mitanni, between the Tigris and the Euphrates&quot; rivers, which had previously been a Hittite vassal state.

The peace treaty was recorded in two versions, one in Egyptian hieroglyphs, and the other in Akkadian using cuneiform script; both versions survive. Such dual-language recording is common to many subsequent treaties. The treaty differs from others, however, in that the two language versions are worded differently. Although the majority of the text is identical, the Hittite version claims that the Egyptians came suing for peace, and the Egyptian version claims the reverse. The treaty was given to the Egyptians in the form of a silver plaque, and the &quot;pocket-book&quot; version was taken back to Egypt and carved into the Temple of Karnak.

The Treaty was concluded between Ramesses II and Hatusiliš III in the twenty-first year of Ramesses&#x27; reign (). Its eighteen articles call for peace between Egypt and Hatti and then proceed to maintain that their respective people also demand peace. It contains many elements found in more modern treaties, but it is more far-reaching than later treaties&#x27; simple declaration of the end of hostilities. It also contains a mutual-assistance pact in case one of the empires should be attacked by a third party or in the event of internal strife. There are articles pertaining to the forced repatriation of refugees and provisions that they should not be harmed, which might be thought of as the first extradition treaty. There are also threats of retribution, should the treaty be broken.

The treaty is considered of such importance in the field of international relations that a replica of it hangs in the UN&#x27;s headquarters.

Following the five years war between Kushite Kandake, Amanirenas and Augustus of Rome, a peace treaty was conducted in the year 21/20 BC. Mediators were sent from Kush to Augustus who was in Samos at that time. An entente between the two parties was beneficial to both. The Kushites were a regional power in their own right and resented paying tribute. The Romans also sought a quiet southern border for their absolutely essential Egyptian grain supplies, without constant war commitments, and welcomed a friendly buffer state in a border region beset with raiding nomads. The Kushites too appear to have found nomads like the Blemmyes to be a problem. The conditions were ripe for a deal. During negotiations, Augustus granted the Kushite envoys all they asked for, and also cancelled the tribute earlier demanded by Rome. Premmis (Qasr Ibrim), and areas north of Qasr Ibrim in the southern portion of the &quot;Thirty-Mile Strip&quot; were ceded to the Kushites. The Dodekaschoinos was established as a buffer zone, and Roman forces were pulled back to the old Greek Ptolemaic border at Maharraqa. Roman emperor Augustus signed the treaty with the Kushites on Samos. The settlement bought Rome peace and quiet on its Egyptian frontier, as well as increased the prestige of Roman Emperor Augustus, demonstrating his skill and ability to broker peace without constant warfare, and do business with the distant Kushites, who a short time earlier had been fighting his troops. The respect accorded the emperor by the Kushite envoys as the treaty also created a favorable impression with other foreign ambassadors present on Samos, including envoys from India, and strengthened Augustus&#x27; hand in upcoming negotiations with the powerful Parthians. The settlement ushered in a period of peace between the two empires for around three centuries. Inscriptions erected by Queen Amanirenas on an ancient temple at Hamadab, south of Meroe, record the war and the favorable outcome from the Kushite perspective. Along with his signature on the official treaty, Roman emperor Augustus marked the agreement by directing his administrators to collaborate with regional priests in the erection of a temple at Dendur, and inscriptions depict the emperor himself celebrating local deities.

===Modern history===
Famous examples include the Treaty of Paris (1815), signed after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, and the Treaty of Versailles, formally ending the First World War between Germany and the Allies. Despite popular belief, the war did not end completely until the Allies concluded peace with the Ottoman Empire in 1919 at the Treaty of Sèvres, and even then the reaction to this treaty caused the outbreak of the Turkish War of Independence. Upon the victory of the Turkish National Movement in that conflict and the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, the last major diplomatic extension of the First World War came to an end.

The Treaty of Versailles, as well as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, is possibly the most notorious of peace treaties, and is blamed by many historians for the rise of Nazism in Germany and the eventual outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. The costly reparations that Germany was forced to pay the victors, the fact that Germany had to accept sole responsibility for starting the war, and the harsh restrictions on German rearmament were all listed in the Treaty of Versailles and caused massive resentment in Germany. Whether or not the treaty can be blamed for starting another war, it exemplifies the difficulties involved in making peace. However, no such conflict resulted from the more punitive settlement with the Ottoman Empire.

Another famous example would be the series of peace treaties known as the Peace of Westphalia. It initiated modern diplomacy, involving the modern system of nation-states. Subsequent wars were no longer over religion but revolved around issues of state. That encouraged Catholic and Protestant powers to ally, leading to a number of major realignments.

The Korean War is an example of a conflict that was ended by an armistice, rather than a peace treaty with the Korean Armistice Agreement. However, that war has never technically ended, because a final peace treaty or settlement has never been achieved.

A more recent example of a peace treaty is the 1973 Paris Peace Accords that sought to end the Vietnam War.

<text>Melvin Eugene Carnahan (February 11, 1934 – October 16, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 51st governor of Missouri from 1993 until his death in 2000. Carnahan was a Democrat and held various positions in government.

Born in rural Missouri, Carnahan was the son of Representative A. S. J. Carnahan and attended campaign events with his father. He moved to Washington, D.C., with his father and attended high school and college there. After a stint in the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Carnahan returned to Missouri, graduating from the University of Missouri in 1959. Shortly after, he moved to Rolla with an eye on entering politics.

First elected as a municipal judge in 1960, Carnahan was elected as a state representative for Phelps County in 1962, where he became majority leader during his second term. After being defeated in a race for state senate in 1966, Carnahan practiced law in Rolla. He returned to politics in 1980, being elected as state treasurer. He served in the post for four years and was defeated in the Democratic primary for governor in 1984. In 1988, he made a second political comeback, winning an election for lieutenant governor, the sole Democratic win statewide.

In 1992, Carnahan made a second bid for governor and defeated St. Louis Mayor Vincent Schoemehl in the Democratic primary. In the general election, he defeated state Attorney General William Webster, becoming the first Democrat elected governor since 1976. During his first term, he signed legislation concerning education and taxes into law. He also dealt with crises such as the Great Flood of 1993. Carnahan was re-elected in 1996, defeating State Auditor Margaret Kelly. During his second term, he faced adversity on issues such as abortion, where his veto of a bill restricting abortion was overridden by the state legislature, and faced controversy surrounding his pardon of a death row inmate at the behest of Pope John Paul II.

In 2000, he ran for the U.S. Senate against incumbent John Ashcroft in a hotly contested election. During the final weeks of the campaign, Carnahan was killed in a plane crash while on his way to a campaign event. He was posthumously elected to the U.S. Senate, and his widow, Jean Carnahan, was appointed to serve in the Senate until a special election was held in 2002.

==Early life and education==
Melvin Eugene Carnahan was born in Birch Tree, Missouri, and grew up on a small farm near Ellsinore. He was the son of Mary Kathel (née Schupp) and A. S. J. Carnahan, and had one sibling, an older brother, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Carnahan. Carnahan&#x27;s mother was a teacher, and his father was the superintendent of Ellsinore schools. In 1944, the elder Carnahan was elected to the United States House of Representatives, representing the eighth congressional district, serving from 1945 to 1947 and from 1949 to 1961. He later became the U.S. Ambassador to Sierra Leone under John F. Kennedy. As a child, Mel Carnahan traveled with his father across the district, attending local events and helping with the campaign. In 1948, because his father was running for Congress, Carnahan was present for Harry Truman&#x27;s final campaign stop in St. Louis during that year&#x27;s presidential election. The younger Carnahan later said he developed a desire to enter politics because of his father.

In 1945, Carnahan moved to Washington, D.C., with his family, though they moved back to Missouri when his father was defeated for re-election. He moved back to D.C. in 1949, where he met his future wife, Jean, at a Baptist church. He graduated from Anacostia High School and earned a Bachelor of Arts in business administration at George Washington University in 1954. After graduating, Carnahan joined the United States Air Force but failed the physical, fainting during a blood test. He then served as a special agent for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations from 1954 to October 1956. He rose to the rank of first lieutenant. After returning home, he received a Juris Doctor from the University of Missouri School of Law in Columbia in 1959, graduating Order of the Coif. He then moved to Rolla, the largest city in his father&#x27;s congressional district, intending to follow his father&#x27;s career path.

==Early political career==
===State legislator===
Carnahan&#x27;s political career started in 1960 at 26 when he was elected to serve as a judge in Rolla. In 1962, he ran for a seat in the Missouri House of Representatives. In the Democratic primary, Carnahan defeated three opponents. That November, he won the election for the Phelps County house district. He won re-election in 1964, and that same year, the Democratic caucus elected him as assistant floor leader to majority leader H. F. Patterson. In 1965, Patterson died, and the caucus elected Carnahan as his successor.

During his tenure, Carnahan voted in favor of a motion to increase the state&#x27;s sales tax to 3% and voted against a measure requiring tax increases to be conducted via a public vote. Carnahan served as a Judiciary Committee member, during which the committee moved to pass a conflict-of-interest law requiring any official to report any interests in a bill before voting on it. As majority leader, Carnahan was able to help advance a bill banning racial discrimination in public areas; this bill was later signed into law by Governor Warren E. Hearnes. Carnahan also sponsored a bill to prevent employers from discriminatory hiring practices.

In 1965, a federal court ruling that Missouri&#x27;s districts suffered from malapportionment forced the state to redraw its legislative districts. Carnahan helped draw up a redistricting plan, but voters rejected it in a special election. He later clashed with Governor Hearnes over his reapportionment plan for state districts, as Carnahan favored a special session on the issue. In contrast, Hearnes&#x27;s plan would let himself pick the members of the reapportionment commission. Eventually, a compromise was reached, and Carnahan was the deciding vote in favor of its implementation.

In 1966, Carnahan ran in the 20th district for the state Senate. In the Democratic primary, he faced Gene Sally, a former state representative and state senator whom Governor Hearnes had implicitly supported. Carnahan defeated Sally in what his wife Jean later described as one of the hardest-fought campaigns he had run. Carnahan faced Republican state senator Don Owens in the general election. The 20th district was considered more-Democratic-leaning but still competitive. In November, Owens defeated Carnahan by nearly 4,000 votes. Some press outlets considered the defeat to be unexpected. Carnahan later said of the defeat: &quot;Strangely enough, I value the experience of losing. It does something to you, but it gives perspective.&quot;

After his defeat and after his term in the state house expired, Carnahan practiced law in Rolla. In 1971, he briefly expressed interest in a bid for Missouri&#x27;s eighth congressional district. Ultimately, incumbent Richard Ichord, who defeated Carnahan&#x27;s father in 1960 and was planning a gubernatorial bid, ran for re-election. In addition to practicing law, Carnahan also held a role in Rozark Farms Inc., a charcoal company his father founded, until 1975, when Carnahan sold his share of the company to his brother. During this time, Carnahan also became president of the Rolla school board; during his tenure on the board, he brought in a new superintendent and helped raise funds to build a new junior high school.

===State treasurer===

In 1979, Carnahan announced his return to politics by declaring his candidacy for Missouri state treasurer, which he also intended to use as a basis for a future gubernatorial run. He had briefly considered another bid for Missouri&#x27;s eighth congressional district, which Richard Ichord was vacating. However, he had already declared his candidacy for the treasurer post when Ichord announced his retirement.

In the Democratic primary, Carnahan faced state representative and former state House majority whip Ed Sweeney, who attacked Carnahan as indebted to banking interests. Carnahan criticized Sweeney for being hypocritical because Sweeney had solicited from banking interests himself, albeit unsuccessfully. Carnahan defeated Sweeney and faced former state senator Gerald Winship in the general election. Carnahan focused his campaign on continuing to build on the work of outgoing treasurer Jim Spainhower in giving funds in a nonpartisan manner and refrained from making personal attacks on his opponent, who ran a similar campaign. Carnahan won the election, returning him to elected office.

Carnahan served as treasurer from 1981 to 1985. During his tenure, Carnahan increased the number of banks that were performing state businesses. issuing policy changes to address the issue of the state favoring certain banks, and setting up a committee to determine which banks would be selected to perform state business. He also enforced a policy to give state funds to banks that gave agriculture-related loans. Additionally, during his tenure, Carnahan allowed certain banks to receive state deposits, with special attention to newer banks and banks willing to support small businesses and minority owned businesses.

In 1984, Carnahan ran for Governor of Missouri. Due to struggles with raising funds during his campaign, Carnahan walked over 300 miles from St. Louis to Kansas City, a move similar to what Governor Joseph Teasdale had done during his first campaign in 1972. Carnahan also campaigned in opposition to state referendums that would legalize parimutuel betting and would create a state lottery. However, he conceded he would enforce the amendments if the public supported them. Both amendments would pass with over 60% of the vote. Carnahan received the endorsements of former Governor Teasdale and from the Missouri chapter of the National Organization for Women. In the August primary, Carnahan lost the Democratic nomination to Lieutenant Governor Kenneth Rothman, who lost the general election to state Attorney General John Ashcroft.

=== Lieutenant governor ===
After his defeat, Carnahan returned to practicing law in Rolla. In 1986, Democrats favored him to run for Missouri&#x27;s eighth congressional district against incumbent Bill Emerson, and he met with leaders to discuss the race. He did not run, and Wayne Cryts would ultimately become the Democratic nominee. During this time, Carnahan expressed interest in becoming chair of the Missouri Democratic Party. In 1988, after initially expressing a lack of interest in running, Carnahan ran for lieutenant governor, which he won. Carnahan&#x27;s election to the lieutenant governorship was the sole Democratic statewide win that year.

The role of lieutenant governor had been seen as irrelevant, and some officials, such as state senator Harry Wiggins, supported measures to abolish the position. Carnahan appealed to the legislature to double the staffing for his office and to expand his access to state planes. He also expressed interest in using the office for economic and highway development. Senate president pro tempore Jim Matthewson called upon Carnahan to become the state&#x27;s drug czar, though Carnahan saw his role as more limited in scale.

Early in Carnahan&#x27;s term, there was a disagreement between Carnahan and Governor John Ashcroft over who was in charge when the governor left the state. Carnahan asserted that in his position, he would be acting governor whenever Ashcroft left the state, while Ashcroft believed he was still in charge. In 1990, Republican Secretary of State Roy Blunt refused to authorize documents Ashcroft signed while he was out of state, a move some political observers contended had been planned. Blunt refused to authorize the documents, owing to confusion over who was in charge while the governor was out of state. Ashcroft called upon the Supreme Court of Missouri to clarify the lieutenant governor&#x27;s role while the governor was out of state. Later that year, while briefly serving as acting governor, Carnahan signed documents, but Blunt refused to authorize any of what he signed. Blunt cited the ongoing court case as his reason for not authorizing the documents, while acknowledging he thought Carnahan was acting governor. A circuit judge ruled the governor was in charge, a ruling the state&#x27;s Supreme Court later affirmed in 1991. This time was later thought to be the beginning of a rivalry between Ashcroft and Carnahan.

While serving as lieutenant governor, Carnahan endorsed Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton for president of the United States in the Missouri primary.

== Governor of Missouri ==
As the sole elected Democrat statewide, Carnahan was immediately seen as a prospective candidate for the governorship. In 1989, he announced his intent to run for governor in 1992. In the Democratic primary, he faced Mayor of St. Louis Vincent C. Schoemehl, who referred to Carnahan as a &quot;redneck from Rolla.&quot; Politicians from both parties had perceived Carnahan as an underwhelming candidate who was liked as a person but generally unexciting. Some of Schoemehl&#x27;s supporters tried to persuade Carnahan to run against Senator Kit Bond in the 1992 U.S. Senate race. Carnahan won the Democratic nomination by a wide margin, winning every county but Ste. Genevieve.

Carnahan faced Republican state Attorney General William L. Webster in the general election. Webster&#x27;s campaign was hurt by controversy surrounding the state&#x27;s Second Injury Fund and his ties to private lawyers associated with the fund. In the general election on November 3, Carnahan was elected as governor of Missouri, defeating Webster by over 400,000 votes. Carnahan&#x27;s election as governor made him the first Democrat to win the office since Joseph Teasdale&#x27;s victory in 1976.

=== First term (1993–1997) ===
Carnahan&#x27;s term as governor began on January 11, 1993. On January 15, 1993, a judge ruled that the state&#x27;s school funding method was unconstitutional. In response to the ruling, Carnahan pushed for the &quot;Outstanding Schools Act&quot;. The law&#x27;s provisions included funding for smaller classrooms, putting computers in classrooms, and supporting vocational programs. Carnahan, who appealed to skeptical legislators, secured approval from the legislature to increase taxes on income, corporations, and tobacco to raise funds. The passed bill raised $315 million in new taxes, earning Carnahan the moniker &quot;the education governor.&quot;

The bill faced opponents who contended that Carnahan broke a promise to bring significant tax increases to a vote for the people to decide. U.S. Representative Mel Hancock criticized the tax increases, saying they defied the state&#x27;s Hancock Amendment, an amendment limiting tax increases without voter approval, of which Hancock was the namesake. Consequently, Hancock put an amendment up for a vote in November 1994, which mandated that all future tax increases require a vote. Carnahan opposed the amendment, saying it would cut billions of dollars from the state&#x27;s budget, possibly forcing the layoffs of teachers and state police. The amendment was defeated by 36 points. In the aftermath, Carnahan persuaded lawmakers to support a yearly cap on tax increases. In 1996, he endorsed a ballot proposal that limited tax raises to no more than $50 million a year unless the people of Missouri voted otherwise. The amendment passed with 69% of voters in favor of its implementation.

The Great Flood of 1993, one of the most destructive floods in U.S. history, affected much of the Midwest, including Missouri. Carnahan returned from a trip to Europe to declare a state of emergency in every county. Carnahan traveled across Missouri viewing areas damaged by flooding, and called a special session of the state legislature to decide how to pay for the damage. As a result of the floods, Carnahan oversaw the buyout of affected towns, including the cities of Pattonsburg and Bellefontaine Neighbors. In addition, Carnahan signed legislation including property tax relief for flood victims and state spending on par with federal funding while vetoing legislation that would have let the state be held responsible for some flood insurance for businesses. His actions during the emergency led other governors to elect him vice chairman of the Democratic Governor&#x27;s Association and vice chairman of the Southern Governor&#x27;s Association. He later became chair of both organizations and gained a seat on the executive committee of the National Governors Association.

Carnahan considered health care a key focus for the 1994 legislative session. His goals, such as mandating health insurance companies to ignore pre-existing conditions, failed to be passed by the legislature. Later that year, Carnahan signed a welfare package with a provision that made recipients sign an agreement to get off welfare in two years in exchange for training for jobs and better benefits. In September 1994, Carnahan called for a special session to impeach Secretary of State Judith Moriarty. Moriarty had been found guilty of certifying election documents for her son, who had incorrectly filed the documents. Carnahan appealed to Moriarty to resign, but she refused. Consequently, Moriarty was impeached and removed from office. Carnahan appointed her replacement, Bekki Cook.

In 1995, Carnahan underwent a trade mission to South Korea, one of Missouri&#x27;s top trading partners. The mission led to new deals between Missouri businesses valued at over $2 million. That same year, Carnahan appointed Ronnie L. White to the Supreme Court of Missouri, the first black judge to be appointed to the court. White later became the state&#x27;s first black chief justice and eventually a federal judge. Carnahan would later describe White&#x27;s appointment as one of his greatest. Carnahan maintained continuously high approval ratings throughout his first term.

=== Second term (1997–2000) ===
In 1996, Carnahan ran for re-election, campaigning on the Outstanding Schools Act, which he argued made way for optimized education methods in the state. His opponent was Republican State Auditor Margaret B. Kelly. Kelly criticized Carnahan as &quot;tax-man Carnahan&quot; for the tax increases needed for education, which she maintained were a broken promise from the governor. On November 5, 1996, Carnahan defeated Kelly to win a second term in office.

Because of the Hancock Amendment&#x27;s provisions on curbing spending, Carnahan returned sizable amounts of money to taxpayers over his second term. In 1997, lawmakers agreed to remove the state&#x27;s grocery tax and reduce taxes for private pensions, which Carnahan signed into law. In 1998, Carnahan signed further tax cuts into law, increasing tax credits for elderly and disabled citizens. The following year, he signed legislation giving tax credits on prescription drugs to older Missourians. By the end of 1999, the tax cuts totaled about $1.3 billion.

In 1997, a judge ruled that Missouri could conclude its involvement in school desegregation cases in St. Louis and Kansas City, provided that a plan to replace state funding was in place by 1999. In 1998, Carnahan signed legislation to prevent the Kansas City school districts from becoming insolvent. He later signed legislation that created a school board for St. Louis school districts, provided some $40 million to public schools in the city, and sought to add suburban school districts to state funding. Also in 1998, Carnahan enacted a bill to expand Medicaid coverage for impoverished children. In August 1998, he made his second appointment to the Missouri Supreme Court, appointing Michael A. Wolff, his former legal advisor. Wolff later served as chief justice for the court from 2005 to 2007.

In 1999, Carnahan, who supported the death penalty, commuted the death sentence of Missouri inmate Darrell Mease after Pope John Paul II requested he do so during his visit to St. Louis. This move was controversial: Carnahan&#x27;s office received more phone calls against the move than those supportive, and 34% of voters indicated in a &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; poll that they felt inclined to vote against Carnahan in his U.S. Senate bid as a result of the move. That same year, he opposed a proposition that would have allowed Missourians to carry concealed weapons. The campaign against the proposal, managed by his daughter Robin, won by a two-point margin despite being outspent.

Carnahan had vetoed three abortion bills in 1997. The issue returned to the political agenda in 1999 when the Missouri legislature proposed a bill to ban mid to late-term abortions. Carnahan vetoed the bill due to its language, which he argued went further than just restricting mid to late-term abortions and because it lacked exceptions for protecting the mother&#x27;s health. The legislature overrode Carnahan&#x27;s veto, making him the seventh governor since Missouri statehood to have a veto overridden.

===2000 U.S. Senate election===
The day after the 1998 midterm elections, Carnahan announced his intention to challenge incumbent Senator John Ashcroft for his U.S. Senate seat in 2000. Despite some calls for him to run for the Class 1 Senate seat in 1994, he declined, wanting to remain governor. He also declined to run in 1998 against Kit Bond, though he refused to consider a future bid permanently out of the question.

The election had been seen as having a personal element due to Carnahan and Ashcroft&#x27;s reported dislike of one another, though both denied having any rivalry. Analyst Stuart Rothenberg considered the campaign to be among the closest races in the country. During the campaign, photographs of Carnahan performing in blackface in 1960 resurfaced, which he apologized for. Carnahan attacked Ashcroft for having a conservative voting record despite employing moderate rhetoric while casting his record as governor as a &quot;moderate, progressive&quot; record. During the campaign, Carnahan launched a tour by train, using a tactic adopted by Harry S. Truman. The tour was an homage to the former president, who had previously held the Senate seat Carnahan was campaigning for.

== Death and aftermath ==
Early in the evening of October 16, 2000, Carnahan, his son Randy, and his campaign advisor Chris Sifford left St. Louis Downtown Airport in Cahokia, Illinois, to attend a campaign event in New Madrid. The Cessna 335 airplane, which Randy piloted, crashed near Hillsboro, Missouri, killing all three people on board. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) later ruled that the crash was due to Randy becoming disoriented, which was exacerbated by inclement weather and instrument failure.

The presidential debate, which was held the next day in St. Louis, opened with a moment of silence, and both candidates made remarks about Carnahan&#x27;s death. A memorial service for Carnahan was held in the State Capitol in Jefferson City on October 20. The service was attended by federal and state politicians such as President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and U.S. senators and former governors Kit Bond and John Ashcroft. At the funeral, President Clinton said: I loved the guy, and anybody who thinks he was dull never looked him straight in the eye, because he had steel and passion and fire, and I think he rather enjoyed being underestimated by the people who disagreed with him.The day after Carnahan&#x27;s death, Lieutenant Governor Roger B. Wilson ascended to the governorship. He served the remainder of Carnahan&#x27;s term. Because Missouri election law did not allow Carnahan&#x27;s name to be removed from the ballot, Governor Wilson promised to appoint his widow, Jean Carnahan, to the seat if it became vacant due to Mel Carnahan&#x27;s election win. Shortly before his death, Carnahan had been behind Ashcroft in the polls. Following his death, Carnahan&#x27;s campaign continued, using slogans such as &quot;I&#x27;m Still with Mel&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Fire Go Out&quot; and Carnahan took the lead in a few polls. In the election, Carnahan became the first person in U.S. history to win a U.S. Senate election posthumously. His death was thought to have helped other races down-ballot that year, including the race for governor. Following the election win, Jean Carnahan was appointed to the Senate and served until November 2002, when Republican Jim Talent defeated her in a special election.

== Awards and recognitions ==
In 1965, Carnahan received an award from Missouri House Speaker Thomas C. Graham, recognizing him as the chamber&#x27;s most outstanding Democrat. Also, during his tenure as a state legislator, he twice received the &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot; Meritorious Service award. In 1999, he was inducted into the DeMolay International Hall of Fame.

In 2001, the mayor of St. Louis, Clarence Harmon, announced the renaming of a courthouse to the Carnahan Courthouse. That same year, a Missouri National Guard armory in Rolla, Missouri, was renamed The Mel Carnahan Armory and Reserve Center. The Carnahan High School of the Future was named after him in 2003. The garden in the Missouri Capitol was renamed after Carnahan. A bust of him was placed there in 2023 and received a dedication in 2024, just one week after his wife&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==
Carnahan met his future wife, Jean Carpenter, at a church event and sat beside her at Anacostia High School. The two married in Washington, D.C., on June 12, 1954. They had four children, who would all become lawyers as well: Roger &quot;Randy&quot; Carnahan, who piloted the airplane and died in the same crash that killed his father; Russ Carnahan, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Missouri&#x27;s 3rd district (2005–2013); Robin Carnahan, former Missouri Secretary of State (2005–2013), 2010 U.S. Senate nominee, and Administrator of General Services under President Joe Biden; and Tom Carnahan, founder of Wind Capital Group, which builds wind farms. The family had a Newfoundland dog named Beaumont.

A reporter once said of Carnahan: &quot;Never the most exciting politician on the Missouri scene, Carnahan stubbornly and quietly plowed through office after office.&quot; Carnahan was noted for having an honest image coupled with a relaxed personality. Many supporters of his wore straight-arrow pins to highlight this. He also had a humorous side; he once granted a pardon to a boy who sought one after lying to his parents. Carnahan and his family were active members of First Baptist Church of Rolla, where he served as an ordained deacon, and he and his wife taught Sunday School. In his spare time, Carnahan was a pilot.

<text>The Battle of White Plains took place during the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War on October 28, 1776, near White Plains, New York. Following the retreat of George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army northward from New York City, British General William Howe landed troops in Westchester County, intending to cut off Washington&#x27;s escape route. Alerted to this move, Washington retreated farther, establishing a position in the village of White Plains but failing to establish firm control over local high ground. Howe&#x27;s troops drove Washington&#x27;s troops from a hill near the village; following this loss, Washington ordered the Americans to retreat farther north.

Later British movements chased Washington across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. Washington then crossed the Delaware and surprised a brigade of Hessian troops in the December 26 Battle of Trenton.

== Background ==

British general William Howe, after evacuating Boston in March 1776, regrouped in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and embarked in June on a campaign to gain control of New York City. The campaign began with an unopposed landing on Staten Island in early July. British troops made another unopposed landing, on Long Island, on August 22, south of the areas where General George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army had organized significant defenses around Brooklyn Heights.

After losing the Battle of Long Island on August 27, General Washington and his army of 9,000 troops escaped on the night of August 29–30 to York Island (as Manhattan was then called). General Howe followed up with a landing on Manhattan on September 15, but his advance was checked the next day at Harlem Heights. After an abortive landing at Throg&#x27;s Neck, he landed troops with some resistance at Pell&#x27;s Point on October 18 to begin an encircling maneuver that was intended to trap Washington&#x27;s army between that force, his troops in Manhattan, and the Hudson River, which was dominated by warships of the Royal Navy. Howe established a camp at New Rochelle, but advance elements of his army were near Mamaroneck, only from White Plains, where there was a lightly defended Continental Army supply depot.

== Prelude ==
On October 20, General Washington sent Colonel Rufus Putnam out on a reconnaissance mission from his camp at Harlem Heights. Putnam discovered the general placement of the British troop locations and recognized the danger to the army and its supplies. When he reported this to Washington that evening, Washington immediately dispatched Putnam with orders to Lord Stirling, whose troops were furthest north, to immediately march to White Plains. They arrived at White Plains at 9:00 am on October 21, and were followed by other units of the army as the day progressed. Washington decided to withdraw most of the army to White Plains, leaving a garrison of 1,200 men under Nathanael Greene to defend Fort Washington on Manhattan. General Howe&#x27;s army advanced slowly, with troops from his center and right moving along the road from New Rochelle to White Plains, while a unit of Loyalists occupied Mamaroneck. The latter was attacked that night by a detachment of Lord Stirling&#x27;s troops under John Haslet, who took more than thirty prisoners as well as supplies, but suffered several killed and 15 wounded. As a result, Howe moved elements of his right wing to occupy Mamaroneck. On October 22, Howe was reinforced by the landing at New Rochelle of an additional 8,000 troops under the command of Wilhelm von Knyphausen.
Washington established his headquarters at the Elijah Miller House in North White Plains on October 23, and chose a defensive position that he fortified with two lines of entrenchments. The trenches were situated on raised terrain, protected on the right by the swampy ground near the Bronx River, with steeper hills further back as a place of retreat. The American defenses were long. Beyond that, on the right, was Chatterton&#x27;s Hill, which commanded the plain over which the British would have to advance. The hill was initially occupied by militia companies numbering several hundred, probably including John Brooks&#x27; Massachusetts militia company.

On October 24 and 25, Howe&#x27;s army moved from New Rochelle to Scarsdale, where they established a camp covering the eastern bank of the Bronx River. This move was apparently made in the hopes of catching Charles Lee&#x27;s column, which had to alter its route toward White Plains and execute a forced march at night to avoid them. Howe remained at Scarsdale until the morning of October 28, when his forces marched toward White Plains, with British troops on the right under General Henry Clinton, and primarily Hessian troops on the left under General von Heister.

== Battle ==
While Washington was inspecting the terrain to determine where it was best to station his troops, messengers alerted him that the British were advancing. Returning to his headquarters, he ordered the 2nd Connecticut Regiment under Joseph Spencer out to slow the British advance, and sent Haslet and the 1st Delaware Regiment, along with Alexander McDougall&#x27;s brigade (Rudolphus Ritzema&#x27;s 3rd New York Regiment, Charles Webb&#x27;s 19th Continental Regiment, William Smallwood&#x27;s 1st Maryland Regiment, and the 1st New York Regiment and 2nd New York Regiments) to reinforce Chatterton Hill.

Spencer&#x27;s force advanced to a position on the old York road at Hart&#x27;s corners (Hartsdale, New York) and there exchanged fire with the Hessians led by Colonel Johann Rall that were at the head of the British left column. When Clinton&#x27;s column threatened their flank, these companies were forced into a retreat across the Bronx River that was initially orderly with pauses to fire from behind stone walls while fire from the troops on Chatterton Hill covered their move, but turned into a rout with the appearance of dragoons. Rall&#x27;s troops attempted to gain the hill, but were repelled by fire from Haslet&#x27;s troops and the militia, and retreated to a nearby hilltop on the same side of the river. This concerted defense brought the entire British Army, which was maneuvering as if to attack the entire American line, to a stop.

While Howe and his command conferred, the Hessian artillery on the left opened fire on the hilltop position, where they succeeded in driving the militia into a panicked retreat. The arrival of McDougall and his brigade helped to rally them, and a defensive line was established, with the militia on the right and the Continentals arrayed along the top of the hill. Howe finally issued orders, and while most of his army waited, a detachment of British and Hessian troops was sent to take the hill.

The British attack was organized with Hessian regiments leading the assault. Rall was to charge the American right, while a Hessian battalion under Colonel Carl von Donop (consisting of the Linsing, Mingerode, Lengereck, and Kochler grenadiers, and Donop&#x27;s own chasseur regiment) was to attack the center. A British column under General Alexander Leslie (consisting of the 5th, 28th, 35th, and 49th foot) was to attack the right. Donop&#x27;s force either had difficulty crossing the river or was reluctant to do so, and elements of the British force were the first to cross. Rall&#x27;s charge scattered the militia on the American right, leaving the flank of the Maryland and New York regiments exposed as they poured musket fire onto the British attackers, which temporarily halted their advance. The exposure of their flank caused them to begin a fighting retreat, which progressively forced the remainder of the American line, which had engaged with the other segments of the British force, to give way and retreat. Haslet&#x27;s Delaware regiment, which anchored the American left, provided covering fire while the remaining troops retreated to the north, and were the last to leave the hill. The fighting was intense, and both sides suffered significant casualties before the Continentals made a disciplined retreat.

== Casualties ==
John Fortescue&#x27;s &quot;History of the British Army&quot; says that Howe&#x27;s casualties numbered 214 British and 99 Hessians. However, Rodney Atwood points out that Fortescue&#x27;s figure for the Hessians includes the entire Hessian casualties from 19 to 28 October and that in fact only 53 of these casualties were incurred at the Battle of White Plains. This revised figure would give a total of 267 British and Hessians killed, wounded or missing at White Plains. Henry Dawson, on the other hand, gives Howe&#x27;s loss as 47 killed, 182 wounded and four missing. The American loss is uncertain. Theodore Savas and J. David Dameron give a range of 150–500 killed, wounded and captured. Samuel Roads numbers the casualties of 47 killed and 70 wounded. Henry Dawson estimates 50 killed, 150 wounded and 17 missing for McDougall&#x27;s and Spencer&#x27;s commands but has no information on the losses in Haslet&#x27;s regiment.

== Aftermath ==
The two generals remained where they were for two days, while Howe reinforced the position on Chatterton Hill, and Washington organized his army for retreat into the hills. With the arrival of additional Hessian and Waldeck troops under Lord Percy on October 30, Howe planned to act against the Americans the following day. However, a heavy rain fell the whole next day, and when Howe was finally prepared to act, he awoke to find that Washington had again eluded his grasp.

Washington withdrew his army into the hills to the north on the night of October 31, establishing a camp near North Castle. Howe chose not to follow, instead attempting without success to draw Washington out. On November 5, he turned his army south to finish evicting Continental Army troops from Manhattan, a task he accomplished with the November 16 Battle of Fort Washington.

Washington eventually crossed the Hudson River at Peekskill with most of his army, leaving New England regiments behind to guard supply stores and important river crossings. Later, British movements chased him across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania, and the British established a chain of outposts across New Jersey. Washington, seeing an opportunity for a victory to boost the nation&#x27;s morale, crossed the Delaware and surprised Rall&#x27;s troops in the December 26 Battle of Trenton.

== Legacy ==
Each year on or near the anniversary date, the White Plains Historical Society hosts a commemoration of the event at the Jacob Purdy House in White Plains, New York. Two ships in the United States Navy were named for the Battle of White Plains. CVE-66 was an escort carrier in World War II. AFS-4 was a combat stores ship that was decommissioned in 1995.

According to some historians, the Headless Horseman depicted in Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; was inspired by a real-life Hessian soldier who lost his head by cannon fire during this battle.

<text>First Landing is a 2002 science fiction novel by Robert Zubrin that tells the story of the first crewed space expedition to Mars. Zubrin is the head of the Mars Society, an organization lobbying the real world NASA to send astronauts to Mars. The plan used to accomplish their mission in the book is the same one advocated by his group.

In the novel, the explorers discover bacterial life on Mars and are abandoned due to political circumstances, and must fend for themselves if they want to return to Earth, thus highlighting many of the more robust features of Zubrin&#x27;s plan for Mars.

Zubrin also wrote &quot;The Case for Mars&quot;, a detailed nonfiction explanation of the same plan.

<doc id="404519" wikidata="Q239513" url="?curid=404519" title="Mark Viduka">
<text>Mark Antony Viduka ( ; born 9 October 1975) is an Australian former soccer player who played as a centre forward. Viduka captained the Australia national team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, reaching the Round of 16, which remains their joint-best performance to date. His four goals in the UEFA Champions League are the most scored by any Australian player.

==Club career==
===Melbourne Knights===
In 1993, Viduka started his professional career in Australia for Melbourne Knights (which up until the 1993 season was known as Melbourne Croatia) and became an Australian international in June of the following year. In his two seasons with the Knights, he was top goal scorer in the National Soccer League (NSL) and was twice awarded the Johnny Warren Medal for NSL Best Player of the Year in 1993–94 and 1994–95. His time at Melbourne Knights included one NSL title in the 1994–95 season. The grandstand at Knights&#x27; Stadium, home of the Knights, was renamed the &quot;Mark Viduka Stand&quot; in his honour and paid for with his transfer money.

===Dinamo Zagreb===
In 1995, Viduka moved to Croatia to play with Croatia Zagreb (now Dinamo Zagreb). He spent three and a half seasons with the club, helping it to win three doubles in Croatia between 1996 and 1998. He was also part of the Croatia Zagreb team that reached the third round of the UEFA Cup in 1997 and went on to make his UEFA Champions League group stage debut with the club a year later. He won the Best Foreigner Footballer Award in the Croatian League in his time at Zagreb.

===Celtic===
Celtic bought Viduka in December 1998 for £3.5 million. In the same month as his signing, Celtic announced that Viduka had quit the club without kicking a ball for them, citing stress as his reason.

A week later, Croatia Zagreb complained that it had not received the agreed fee for the player. These issues were eventually resolved and Viduka made his first appearance in a Celtic shirt on 16 February 1999, scoring for the under-21 team as an over-age player in a 4–2 victory against Motherwell. After making his first team debut against Dundee United on 27 February 1999, his first goals for the club came when he scored a brace against Greenock Morton in the Scottish Cup on 8 March 1999. He was voted Scottish Player of the Year for 1999–2000 after scoring 27 goals in his first full season at Celtic Park. He was regarded as a skilled player, with Josip Šimunić noting his ability to hold the ball up well and bring other players into the game.

In February 2000, lower league team Inverness Caledonian Thistle defeated Celtic in a shock upset in the third round of the Scottish Cup. During half time Viduka reportedly threw his boots in the bin and refused to play in the second half after an altercation with assistant coach, Eric Black. The match ended 3–1 with Celtic fans in uproar.

In March 2000, Viduka assisted Celtic to win Scotland&#x27;s 1999-2000 Scottish League Cup. He left after his first full season at the club.

===Leeds United===
Leeds United manager David O&#x27;Leary signed Viduka just before the 2000–01 season for £6 million. At Leeds, he was expected to line up in a three-pronged attack alongside the previous season&#x27;s top scorer Michael Bridges and Australia teammate Harry Kewell, but injuries to those two saw him form a partnership with Alan Smith in Leeds&#x27; Champions League matches, while Robbie Keane – signed on loan from Inter Milan as cover for Bridges – also benefited in their Premier League matches together in the second half of the season. In his first season, Viduka scored 22 goals, including all four in a memorable 4–3 win over Liverpool at Elland Road. He signed a five-year deal in the summer of 2001 and would star in both domestic competitions and Europe, with Leeds finishing in the country&#x27;s top four in 2000–01, and fifth in 2001–02. In the summer of 2001, Viduka was the subject of interest from A.C. Milan, whom he supported as a child, but the move ultimately did not happen, and held talks with Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, but decided against moving across the Pennines to join Leeds&#x27; rivals.

In the 2002–03 campaign, Viduka scored another 22 goals, including a hat-trick in a 6–1 win at Charlton Athletic and the winner in a 3–2 victory at Arsenal on the penultimate day of the season that effectively saved United from relegation.

However, the club&#x27;s financial crisis continued, and resulted in the sale of key players including Harry Kewell and Robbie Keane. In the 2003–04 season, Viduka was again top scorer at Leeds, finishing the season strongly as was the case in the previous season, as interim manager Eddie Gray attempted to steer the club away from the Premier League trap door following the departure of Peter Reid in November after eight months as manager.

However, during his final appearance in the jersey, Leeds were relegated in a 4–1 loss to Bolton Wanderers at Reebok Stadium. After scoring a penalty, Viduka was sent off following two yellow cards. He was sold to Middlesbrough in the summer of 2004 as United&#x27;s financial difficulties deepened.

===Middlesbrough===
Following Middlesbrough&#x27;s League Cup victory in 2004, the club qualified for the 2004–05 UEFA Cup. The squad was bolstered with a number of high-profile signings to cope with the increased fixture list and to ensure it could compete on the European stage. Viduka was signed from Leeds for £4.5 million and unveiled as one of the marquee signings of the summer.

Viduka&#x27;s debut season at Middlesbrough was initially impressive, albeit frustrated by injuries. However, in his second season, the 2005–06 season, Viduka was in sensational form in all competitions for Middlesbrough, reaching double figures early on in the season, including a stunning volley away at Birmingham. He played an important part in helping the club reach the League Cup quarter final, FA Cup semi final and UEFA cup final. Viduka helped to spearhead a European campaign which saw the club overturn a three-goal deficit in the quarter and semi final second legs of the competition to proceed to the final. Middlesbrough eventually lost in the final to Sevilla on 10 May 2006, a result which Viduka has since said took him four months to get over.

In August 2006, he was awarded the number 9 shirt at Middlesbrough, his preferred number at all his previous clubs. Viduka&#x27;s third season at Middlesbrough was his most prolific, scoring 19 goals in all competitions. With his contract due to expire at the end of the 2006–07 season, Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate expressed his interest in retaining Viduka. Southgate reiterated his wish to retain Viduka&#x27;s services and revealed he would offer him a new contract. Given his impressive haul for the season, Viduka attracted interest from a number of clubs who were hoping to sign him on a free transfer as he became out-of-contract. Viduka joined north-east rivals Newcastle United on a free transfer on 7 June 2007.

Viduka remains Middlesbrough&#x27;s top goalscorer at the Riverside, and regularly features in Middlesbrough fan polls for top XI Riverside era players.

===Newcastle United===

In signing for Newcastle, Viduka became manager Sam Allardyce&#x27;s first signing at the club. His contract was for two years, with the option of a third year. He made his Newcastle debut in a Premier League match at Bolton on 11 August and scored his first goal on 26 August against his former club Middlesbrough.

On 23 September, he scored a further two goals against West Ham United to bring his tally up to three for Newcastle. On 23 December, he again scored two goals against Derby County. After an injury lay off over the new year, Viduka was brought back into the side by new manager Kevin Keegan, where he played as part of a 4–3–3 formation along with Michael Owen and Obafemi Martins. This new formation brought about a change of fortune for Newcastle as the three strikers rescued them from a relegation battle, with Viduka scoring two more goals over the rest of the season and setting up others for Martins and Owen before picking up an Achilles&#x27; heel injury before the last game of the season.

Viduka made his return to the first team after six months out injured at former club Middlesbrough, coming on for Martins as a substitute on 29 November 2008. This was a great relief for manager Joe Kinnear, who stated that he had previously feared the Australian&#x27;s career might have been prematurely ended by his injury woes. Later, Kinnear suggested to reporters that Viduka might call time on his career at the end of the 2008–09 season. Viduka, however, later expressed his desire to continue playing past this season after acquiring a groin injury in late December. After returning from injury, he was immediately used by newly appointed coach Alan Shearer in an attempt to prevent the team&#x27;s relegation. After playing a man of the match performance in the 3–1 victory against his former team Middlesbrough, Mark appeared to have scored his first goal of the season against Fulham. Match referee Howard Webb, however, ruled that Kevin Nolan impeded goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer disallowing the goal. He was released following Newcastle&#x27;s relegation.

==International career==
Viduka was available to be selected to Australia, Croatia and Ukraine due to his origins, and he began his international career with Australia in a friendly series against South Africa at the age of 18 in June 1994. The first game was played in Adelaide and the second game was played in Sydney. Australia won both games 1–0. He scored his first international goal in October 1997 in the 23rd minute of a friendly game against Tunisia.

In 1996, Viduka joined the Olyroos as they competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics. In Australia&#x27;s first group game they lost to France 2–0. In their second group match they defeated Saudi Arabia 2–1. Viduka scored Australia&#x27;s second goal in the 63rd minute with a clever back flick past the goalkeeper. In Australia&#x27;s final group game Viduka made a contribution early in the game with an assist to Aurelio Vidmar in the 3rd minute. Despite Australia&#x27;s early 0–2 lead, Spain made a spirited comeback and won 3–2. Due to the losses to France and Spain the Olyroos did not progress further in the tournament.

Viduka featured in the two World Cup qualifiers against Iran in 1997. Australia failed to qualify. Viduka was also a part of the Australia team that competed in the 1997 Confederations Cup. He scored Australia&#x27;s opening goal in a 3–1 win over Mexico in Australia&#x27;s first group game. However, in the final against Brazil he was sent off in the 24th minute after receiving a red card. Australia went on to lose the encounter 6–0.

In 1999, Viduka featured in a friendly against Brazil. The game was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and concluded with a 2–2 draw. Viduka assisted Paul Agostino with the first goal of the game. He also appeared in friendly matches against Hungary and Czech Republic in 2000. Defeating Hungary 3-0 and losing to Czech Republic 3–1. That same here Viduka once again joined the Olyroos in the 2000 Olympic Games in his home country of Australia. In 2001, he played alongside Australia as they competed against Uruguay in a two leg World Cup Qualifier. Australia lost on aggregate 3–1. This meant Viduka and Australia spent another World Cup on the sidelines.

In 2003, Viduka scored his third international goal in a friendly against Ireland. Australia would go on to lose the match 2–1.

Viduka began captaining Australia in September 2005 in place of the injured Craig Moore, the regular captain. His first game as captain was in a World Cup Qualifier against Solomon Islands in Sydney, in which Australia won 7–0. He scored 2 goals on the occasion including a spectacular bicycle-kick goal. Viduka would go on to score a third goal only to be denied a hat-trick after being ruled offside. It was his first time playing against a team from the Oceana region. In October 2005, he continued his captaincy when he led Australia to a 5-0 crushing of Jamaica at Craven Cottage in a friendly game. In the 47th minute of the game Archie Thompson crossed to Viduka, who controlled the ball, thought about appealing for handball but then had time to crash the ball into the net.

Viduka thrived under Guus Hiddink&#x27;s tenure as coach of the national squad and led Australia as it qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany over a two-leg qualifier against Uruguay. In the second leg, during the first half a swift flick kick from Viduka found Harry Kewell inside the box. Kewell scuffed his shot but the ball bounced kindly to Mark Bresciano who went on to score the goal that forced the Qualifier to go to a penalty shoot out. Viduka would go on to miss his penalty, however Australia went on to win the shootout anyway.

It was the first time in 32 years that Australia qualified to participate in the World Cup. On 21 May 2006, he was named as the Australian captain for the World Cup.

In a lead up to the World Cup, Viduka captained Australia to friendly matches against the Netherlands and Greece. The Greece game was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Australia won 1–0. Australia&#x27;s game with the Netherlands ended with a 1–1 draw. After trailing 1-0 Australia earned a penalty in the second half. Viduka took the spot kick, only to hit the top bar. However Tim Cahill scored of the rebound. Viduka also led Australia&#x27;s national team to their first World Cup finals victory with a 3–1 win over Japan in June 2006, as well as guiding them through an encounter with Brazil, losing 2–0, and a controversial bout with Croatia, ending with a 2–2 draw. He then led Australia into the second round, where they lost their round of 16 match to Italy. Although a regular scorer in the Premier League, Viduka has struggled to score any significant goals for the &quot;Socceroos&quot;, and the 2006 World Cup was no different.

Viduka considered retiring from international competition after the 2006 World Cup, citing increasing family commitments as the primary reason. In September 2006, however, he confirmed that he would continue playing for Australia and intended to compete in the 2007 Asian Cup. In a friendly against Singapore, a week before the start of the Asian Cup, Viduka scored two headed goals in a 3–0 victory for Australia; former Leeds teammate Harry Kewell scored the third. It was the second time he scored two goals in an international match, having previously done so against the Solomon Islands in 2005.

On Australia&#x27;s first ever Asian Cup participation, Viduka captained the side and he scored their solitary goal against Iraq, a game which they ultimately lost 1–3. In the next match, he scored two goals against co-host team Thailand, defeating them 4–0; other goals scored by Michael Beauchamp and Harry Kewell and making them fall out of the remaining competition. At one stage, he led the goalscoring at the Asian Cup tournament, although his team was eliminated in the quarter-finals in a penalty shootout against Japan. Subsequent to that loss, question marks hang over whether Viduka will continue his international career. Two years on from the 2007 Asian Cup, he was still yet to return for the &quot;Socceroos&quot;, either stating he had injuries or club commitments. He missed World Cup Qualifiers against Qatar, Bahrain and Japan, even though fully fit and asked to play by then-Socceroos manager Pim Verbeek. Questions were raised over his commitment to the national team, even by other members of the squad. Despite calls from Adrian Alston, Graham Arnold and Viduka&#x27;s then-agent Steve Kutner for Viduka to be selected for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Viduka had already decided to retire, aged 34.

==Personal life==
Viduka and his wife Ivana have three sons together: Joseph (born November 2002), Lucas (born September 2006) and Oliver (born May 2008). His father Joe immigrated to Australia from Croatia in the 1960s, and Croatian footballer and Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Luka Modrić is his cousin.

Viduka currently lives in Zagreb, where he owns a coffee shop and enjoys making coffee.

Viduka had a song written about him by English singer/songwriter and Middlesbrough fan Alistair Griffin (who also previously co-wrote the football song recorded by Terry Venables). The song lyrics were written to the tune of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate embraced the tune as a way of raising money for his chosen charity, Macmillan Cancer Support. Leonard Cohen gave permission for the song to be released as a charity download single.

Viduka was a huge AC Milan fan as a kid as he grew up watching Marco van Basten, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit.

Viduka has been a member of Melbourne City FC since its inaugural season. He is affectionately referred to by his nicknames &quot;V-Bomber&quot; and &quot;Big Dukes&quot; in Australia.

<text>Lansdowne House now 9 Fitzmaurice Place is the remaining part of an aristocratic English town house building to the south of Berkeley Square in central London, England. The initial name was for two decades Shelburne House, then its title matched its owning family&#x27;s elevation to a higher peerage in 1784. In the mid to late 19th century, it was frequently let, as a whole, to families of very high wealth or income, such as Lord Rosebery and Hannah de Rothschild of Mentmore Towers from 1878 to 1890. Some of its 18th-century interiors, among the best in London, were taken elsewhere. It was at different times leased by three 19th century British prime ministers, and William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor of Cliveden House, widely believed to be the richest man in America at the time of his tenancy (1891–1893) and also by Harry Gordon Selfridge in the 1920s. Landsdowne&#x27;s heirs sold the property in 1929, two years after the death of the 5th Marquess, a prominent government frontbencher (cabinet minister).

The local authority had built an approach road in 1931 which saw the loss of approximately half of the rooms of its greater wing; it is today one of two buildings which open onto Fitzmaurice Place but is known as 9 Fitzmaurice Place. The surviving extent was granted Grade II* Listed Building status in 1970. The house was also the inspiration for Bingham House in Montreal, built by Lord Shelburne&#x27;s great friend William Bingham in 1821, who was then the wealthiest man in North America and an associate of Alexander Hamilton.

Notable guests have included Benjamin Franklin, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and the Comte de Mirabeau, among others.

==Current use==
It houses the Lansdowne Club in Mayfair. It co-serves as an address of Fitzmaurice House Ltd, the International Wine and Food Society which may meet here and The Junior League of London.

==History==
It was designed by Robert Adam as a house for John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute but in 1763 he sold it (one year into its building) to William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne (both men became Prime Minister); the structure was finished in 1768. Adam commissioned the local sculptor Thomas Carter the Younger to carve the chimney-pieces of his design. Shelburne retained Adam until 1771, when his wife died, with parts of the decoration still incomplete. George Dance the Younger (in the 1790s of George III&#x27;s reign) and Robert Smirke (at the end of his associated Regency) worked on the house.

From 1763 to 1929, it belonged to the seniormost branch of the Petty-FitzMaurice family, elevated from 1784 to a high peerage, as Marquesses of Lansdowne. In 1931, the house, in compensation seeing its extension built to the south-west, saw half of its greater original wing, the east wing, demolished to allow the street Fitzmaurice Place to be built. Since 1935, the residue accommodates the Lansdowne Club.

Winston Churchill commented that in Victorian and Edwardian London, &quot;glittering parties at Lansdowne House, Devonshire House or Stafford House (Lancaster House) comprised all the elements which made a gay and splendid social circle in close relation to the business of Parliament, the hierarchies of the Army and Navy, and the policy of the State&quot;.

Its front private garden exceeded its building&#x27;s footprint but was subject to another&#x27;s restrictive covenants. Its main front lay further forward and was a garden front to this green expanse (between Berkeley Square and Devonshire House&#x27;s gardens). This conservation guaranteed for Devonshire House on Piccadilly open aspects (greenery-covered land save for discreet fences/railings) up to and including all of Berkeley Square. These reasons are set out in the Square&#x27;s article.

In 2022, Blackstone finalized an agreement to redevelop Lansdowne House (the namesake office block at 57 Berkeley Square, opposite the Lansdowne Club; see dispersal of name below) as its European headquarters. Prime Minister Liz Truss called the agreement &quot;a resounding vote of confidence in the United Kingdom as Europe’s leading financial centre.&quot;

===Famous residents===

==Partial demolition and dispersal of name==

In the 1930s, the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster Council decided to build a road from Berkeley Square to Curzon Street, which required the demolition of all the garden front rooms of Lansdowne House. One of Adam&#x27;s three drawing rooms was removed and installed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, while the Dining Room went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The façade was rebuilt in a modified form at the front of the reduced house; about half of the north-west corner has also been lost.

On 1 May 1935, the Lansdowne Club opened as a &#x27;social, residential and athletic Club for members of social standing...&#x27;. It comprises the remaining 18th-century rooms plus a large 1930s extension in the Art Deco style.
Many works of art, such as the Lansdowne Amazon and the Lansdowne Hercules, were also bought by American and British museums. The Lansdowne Hermes resides at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in California. Other objects moved to Bowood House, the Lansdowne country house, where Adam had also worked, which remains in the family, though large parts of it were demolished in 1956.

A large office block, 57 Berkeley Square, with classical fronts and surrounding roads, occupies what was the garden. This still uses as line of its address the name of the old house. What is left of the house, with a 20th-century extension, is now called 9, Fitzmaurice Place.

Extensive renovations began in 2000.

<text>Heage is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Ripley, in the Amber Valley district, in the county of Derbyshire, England. It is situated midway between Belper and Ripley. The village is in the Heage and Ambergate ward, which in the 2011 census had a population of 5,013.

Heage is known for its six-sailed windmill; building work started in 1791 and it was first recorded as working in 1797. Each of the six sails weighs nearly one ton, and the tower is built from local sandstone.

The name Heage is derived from the Old English &quot;hēah&quot; and &quot;ecg&quot;, and means &#x27;high edge&#x27; or &#x27;high ridge&#x27;. In 1817, the Lysons recorded that &quot;Heage, alias High-edge, lies about five miles from Duffield, upon the road from Chesterfield to Derby. The manor, which had been parcel of the Earldom and Duchy of Lancaster, was granted, with Duffield, to Ditchfield and others. In 1629 it was conveyed to the Stanhope family. Sir William Stanhope bequeathed it, in 1703, to Godfrey Wentworth, Esq. his nephew, whose son of the same name sold it, in 1767, to Francis Hurt, Esq., grandfather of Francis Hurt, Esq., of Alderwasley, who is the present proprietor.&quot;

Also located in Heage, at Morley Park, are the remains of two coke-fired blast furnaces for the smelting of iron, built for Francis Hurt of Alderwasley. The first, built in 1780 was the earliest in Derbyshire. The other was built in 1818 and they represent very early coke-fired blast furnaces. They closed in 1874, and most of the site has returned to nature, but the furnace towers still exist and can be seen next to the A38.

The present school was built about 1862 to replace two much smaller schools that were managed by the Church and the Storer Charity. Later it became a secondary school and is now an infants and primary school. The original old Victorian buildings still form part of the school and the old Church school and Charity school are located nearby. When the school was a secondary school it received pupils from three other schools, The Green school (now demolished), Ridgeway school, which has been converted to a house and Ambergate school that is still an infants and junior school. There are a number of recent housing developments in the village.

Heage has two bus services, the 6.2 and 6.3, both of which are operated by TrentBarton. Service 6E operates Monday to Saturday evenings (not Bank Holidays). The services link the village to the nearby towns of Ripley and Belper, as well as the City of Derby.

The first mention of a post office in Heage was in 1847, closed in 2008. It has three pubs, the Eagle Tavern, the Green man and the Black Boy Inn.

Heage is also home to St. Luke&#x27;s Church, situated on Church Street. It was originally built in 1646. In 1836 the church was enlarged, this created an unusual &#x27;T&#x27; shape which is a rarity in Derbyshire. Services are held every Sunday, varying in traditional and contemporary styles.

== Civil parish ==
The village was previously a parish area containing several communities. Immediately surrounding the core village were: Bakershillock (by Bakers Hill), Cackleton Green (by Parkside and Brook St), Nether Heage, Schoolhouse Hill (by New Road). Upper Hartshay was within the village boundaries but outside the parish. Further afield within the parish were: Ambergate, Black-Horse, Boothgate, Bullbridge, Buckland Hollow, Ridgeway, Sawmills, and Toadmoor, 

Heage was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Duffield, from 1866 Heage was a civil parish in its own right, on 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and merged with Belper. In 1951 the parish had a population of 4433.

<text>Gitta Sereny, CBE (13 March 192114 June 2012) was an Austrian-British biographer, historian, and investigative journalist who became known for her interviews and profiles of infamous figures, including Mary Bell, who was convicted in 1968 of killing two children when she herself was a child, and Franz Stangl, the commandant of the Treblinka extermination camp.

Born and initially raised in Austria, she was the author of five books, including &quot;The Case of Mary Bell: A Portrait of a Child Who Murdered&quot; (1972) and &quot;Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth&quot; (1995).

Sereny was awarded the Duff Cooper Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for her book on Albert Speer in 1995, and the Stig Dagerman Prize in 2002. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2004 for services to journalism.

==Biography==
Sereny was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1921. Her father was a Hungarian Protestant aristocrat, Ferdinand Serény, who died when she was two. Her mother was a former actress from Hamburg, Margit Herzfeld, of German background. Gitta Sereny&#x27;s stepfather was the economist Ludwig von Mises.

When she was thirteen, her train journey to a boarding school in the United Kingdom was delayed in Nürnberg, where she attended one of the annual Nürnberg rallies. After writing about the rally for a class assignment, she was given &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; to read by her teacher so she might be able to understand what she saw there. After the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938, she moved to France, where she worked with orphans during the German occupation until she had to flee the country because of her connection to the French Resistance.

After World War II, she worked for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration with refugees in Allied-occupied Germany. Among her tasks was reuniting with their biological families children who had been kidnapped by the Nazis to be raised as &quot;Aryans&quot;. This could be a traumatic experience because the children did not always remember their original family, but when she accompanied a train-load of such children back to Poland she saw the delight of the original family members at the restoration of the children.

She attended the Nürnberg trials for four days in 1945 as an observer, and it was here that she first saw Albert Speer, about whom she would later write the book &quot;Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth&quot;. It was for this book that she was awarded the 1995 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. The book was also later adapted by David Edgar as the play &quot;Albert Speer&quot; and directed by Trevor Nunn at the National Theatre in 2000.

She married Don Honeyman in 1948 and moved to London, where they raised their two children. Don Honeyman (who died 1 June 2011) was a photographer, who worked for &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, among other publications. The poster of Che Guevara on a red background (1968) is one of his best known creations.

From the mid-1960s and throughout the 1970s she wrote extensively for &quot;The Daily Telegraph Magazine&quot; under the editorship of John Anstey. These articles were often about young people, the social services, children and their relationships with their parents and society. This led to her covering the trial of eleven-year-old Mary Bell (found guilty of murdering two children) and would further lead to her first investigative book on this case.

==Writing==
===Books===
&quot;The Case of Mary Bell&quot; was first published in 1972 following Mary Bell&#x27;s trial; in it Sereny interviewed her family, friends and the professionals involved in looking after Mary during her trial. This book was edited by Diana Athill who would also edit Sereny&#x27;s &quot;Into That Darkness&quot;.

&quot;Into That Darkness&quot; (also following an initial article for the Telegraph magazine) was an examination of the guilt of Franz Stangl, the commandant of the Treblinka and Sobibor extermination camps. She spent 70 hours interviewing him in prison for the article and when she had finished he finally admitted his guilt; he died of a heart attack nineteen hours later.

&quot;Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth&quot; (1995) is a biographical work on Albert Speer, German minister of Armaments during World War II. In it, Sereny explores how much Speer knew about the Holocaust. During the Nuremberg trials, Speer had avoided a death sentence, claiming all the while that he knew nothing of the Holocaust. However, Sereny concludes that Speer must have known based on a letter he wrote to the Jewish community in South Africa (after the war), and the fact that his closest assistant attended the Wannsee Conference (where the details of the genocide of the Jews were worked out) and could not have failed to inform him about the proceedings.

In 1998, her second book on Mary Bell, &quot;Cries Unheard&quot;, caused controversy in the British press because she shared the publishing fee, from Macmillan Publishers, with Mary Bell for collaborating on the book. Sereny was initially criticized in the British press and by the British government, though the book quickly became, and remains, a standard text for professionals working with problem children.

Sereny wrote of her final book, &quot;The German Trauma&quot; (2002): &quot;The nineteen chapters in this book, all intimately concerned with Germany before, during and since the end of the Third Reich, describe more or less sequentially what I saw and learned from 1938 to 1999, thus almost over a lifetime.&quot;

===David Irving libel suit===
British Holocaust denier David Irving initiated a libel case against Sereny and the Guardian Media Group for two reviews in &quot;The Observer&quot; where she asserted he deliberately falsified the historical record in an attempt to rehabilitate the Nazis. Irving maintained a personal animosity for Sereny, whom he calls &quot;that shriveled Nazi hunter&quot;, for successfully refuting his claims since the publication of his book &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War&quot;. In 1977, Sereny cross-checked the source he cited for his assertion that Hitler knew nothing about the &quot;Final Solution&quot;, and therefore could not have ordered the &quot;Final Solution&quot;. Gitta Sereny proved that Irving had made an additional assertion which would have contradicted his claim; &quot;I know many of the same people as he does who were of Hitler&#x27;s circle…&quot;. Ms. Sereny later said, &quot;That is scary for him. He says, &#x27;we jostle at the same trough&#x27;. The difference is that he loves that trough, and I don&#x27;t. There is, I think, for him [David Irving], despair in all of this.&quot; 
Although the case did not go to court, the cost to the Guardian Media Group of preparing its legal defence amounted to £800,000.

==Death==
Gitta Sereny died on 14 June 2012 at age 91 while in Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital, Cambridge, after a long illness.

<doc id="404529" wikidata="Q1741170" url="?curid=404529" title="Kiidk'yaas">
<text>Kiidk&#x27;yaas (meaning &quot;ancient tree&quot; in the Haida language), also known as the Golden Spruce, was a Sitka spruce tree (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot; &#x27;Aurea&#x27;) that grew on the banks of the Yakoun River on the Haida Gwaii archipelago in British Columbia, Canada. It had a rare genetic mutation that caused its needles to be golden in colour (rather than the usual green). Kiidk&#x27;yaas was considered sacred by the Haida people.

Kiidk&#x27;yaas was felled in January 1997 by Grant Hadwin as an act of protest against the logging industry. Kiidk&#x27;yaas and its felling are the subject of John Vaillant&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;The Golden Spruce&quot;.

==Kiidk&#x27;yaas in Haida mythology==
Kiidk&#x27;yaas features prominently in Haida mythology.

The Kiidk&#x27;yaas story tells of a young boy who disrespected nature and thereby caused a terrible storm to descend on his village. Only he and his grandfather survived the storm. As they fled the village, the grandfather warned the boy not to look back. The boy disobeyed, and was immediately turned into the Golden Spruce where he stood.

==Felling==

In January 1997, 47-year-old unemployed forest engineer Grant Hadwin travelled to Haida Gwaii and purchased a chainsaw and other felling equipment. Early on the morning of January 20, 1997 he swam across the freezing Yakoun River and made a series of strategic deep cuts in Kiidk&#x27;yaas. The cuts were designed to leave Kiidk&#x27;yaas standing but weakened, so that it would be knocked over by the next strong winds. The tree fell two days later.

After cutting down the tree, Hadwin left the islands for Prince Rupert, British Columbia. He sent a fax to the media and the Haida nation claiming responsibility for the act, saying that he was motivated by &quot;rage and hatred towards university-trained professionals and their extremist supporters&quot;. The act outraged people throughout Canada and received extensive media coverage. Hadwin was arrested, ordered to return to Haida Gwaii to stand trial, and was released on bail.

Hadwin planned to travel to his trial date by crossing the notoriously stormy and violent Hecate Strait (from Prince Rupert to Masset) alone by kayak in mid-winter. He departed Prince Rupert in February 1997 but never arrived at his trial. What is believed to be Hadwin&#x27;s broken kayak and effects were found on Mary Island in June 1997. Whether he had been murdered, accidentally drowned, or left his belongings behind and fled into the wilderness is not known. His fate remains a mystery.

==Post-felling==

In 1977 a group of botanists from the University of British Columbia (UBC) visited Haida Gwaii to take cuttings of Kiidk&#x27;yaas. These cuttings were grafted onto ordinary Sitka spruce, resulting in two golden saplings. The trees were grown in the UBC Botanical Garden and Centre for Plant Research. Upon hearing of the tree&#x27;s destruction in 1997, the arboretum offered one of the two young trees to replace Kiidk&#x27;yaas. However, the sapling died in storage before it could be transported to Haida Gwaii. The second sapling survives at UBC.

After Kiidk&#x27;yaas&#x27; felling, attempts were made to propagate a further 80 cuttings (with the permission of the Haida people) in order to increase the chances of a successful offspring surviving.

The only wood harvested from the tree was used by Nova Scotia luthier George Rizsanyi and broadcaster Jowi Taylor as part of Six String Nation, a guitar dedicated to Canadian history. Other pieces of the guitar include wood from Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s canoe paddle and Paul Henderson&#x27;s hockey stick.

<doc id="404533" wikidata="Q5580231" url="?curid=404533" title="Goldman, Missouri">
<text>Goldman is an unincorporated community in Jefferson County, Missouri, United States, approximately 25 miles south of St. Louis, and five miles north of the county courthouse at Hillsboro. Goldman is located on Old Lemay Ferry Road, an old trade route connecting Hillsboro and St. Louis.

A post office called Goldman was established in 1895, and remained in operation until 1905. The community has the name of the Goldman brothers, local merchants.

Goldman is adjacent to the historic Sandy Creek Covered Bridge, one of only four covered bridges in Missouri and a state historic site.

The town is located near the site where Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan and two other people died on October 16, 2000, in an airplane crash.

<text>Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr. (born October 30, 1946, in St. Louis) was the 42nd mayor of St. Louis, Missouri, serving three terms from 1981 to 1993. At the time of his first election, he was one of the city&#x27;s youngest mayors. In 1992, Schoemehl was defeated in the Democratic primary by lieutenant governor Mel Carnahan in a bid to become Governor of Missouri. He is best known as being primarily responsible for the NFL St. Louis Cardinals relocating to Phoenix, Arizona, and the expansion of Lambert Airport and the start of the eminent domain destruction of the Carrolton neighborhood in the name of noise abatement.

== Personal life ==
Born in St. Louis in 1946, Schoemehl received a degree in history from the University of Missouri-St. Louis in 1972. He and his wife, Lois, have two sons. Their son Tim Schoemehl made a run for Missouri State Representative District 64 in 2004.

== Political career ==
Schoemehl was elected to the City of St. Louis board of aldermen as a representative from the 28th ward for six years before being elected mayor in 1981. Schoemehl returned to public office in 2003, winning election as a member of the St. Louis School Board. He resigned from that position in November 2005. He recently retired from his post as president and CEO of Grand Center, Inc.

=== Real estate and development ===
Schoemehl is active in the areas of historic preservation and urban design. He helped save the Cupples Warehouses from demolition and promoted &quot;public-private partnerships&quot; that led to more than 600 rehabilitation projects. He also launched Operation Brightside, a City beautification program, and Operation Safestreet, a home safety program. In 1991, Schoemehl served as a committee member for the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.

He has expressed regret for the 1980s destruction of downtown historic buildings and disruption of the Gateway Mall by the fifteen story office building now named after Peabody Energy. Opposition to the plan had been prominent, including historic preservationists relocating offices to one of the endangered buildings. CBS Radio vice president Robert Hyland described it as &quot;an absolute aesthetic disaster.&quot; The destruction of &quot;Real Estate Row&quot; has been described as &quot;one of the greatest tragedies in St. Louis architectural history.&quot;

Among the legacies of Schoemehl&#x27;s tenure as mayor of St. Louis are numerous concrete street blockades nicknamed &quot;Schoemehl pots.&quot;

==== Schoemehlville ====
Building demolitions and development leading to gentrification were among the causes for homelessness claimed by Reverend Larry Rice of the New Life Evangelistic Center when he constructed tent cities named &quot;Schoemehlville&quot; on the City Hall lawn. In several summers during the late 1980s and early 1990s, an estimated 100-150 people lived in the temporary tent cities to raise awareness around housing needs and to protest a lack of city support for homeless people. The encampments often coincided with the annual VP Fair, and in 1987 Rice brought a flock of sheep to City Hall to protest the city &quot;pulling the wool&quot; over the citizen&#x27;s eyes.

=== Bi-State Development Agency ===
In July 2007, Matt Blunt nominated Schoemehl to be one of Missouri&#x27;s five commissioners on the ten person board of commissioners for the Bi-State Development Agency which operates public-transit on both the Illinois and Missouri sides of the Greater St. Louis area. Schoemehl replaced Harvey Harris after the former&#x27;s confirmation by the Missouri Senate.

=== Board of education ===
Schoemehl was elected to the St. Louis City Board of Education in a slate of candidates with significant financial backing from then mayor Francis Slay and several local corporations. The board&#x27;s decision to hire a private firm to restructure the school district and close schools resulted in public protests, a lawsuit, and criticism from education reform scholars Jeff Henig and Amy Stuart Wells. Schoemehl compared dissenting parents of students to Nazis in a heated school board meeting, winning the title of 2003 &quot;Best Villain&quot; from the Riverfront Times.

<text>The NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies (Dutch: &quot;NIOD Instituut voor Oorlogs-, Holocaust- en Genocidestudies&quot;) is an organisation in the Netherlands which maintains archives and carries out historical studies into the Second World War, the Holocaust and other genocides around the world, past and present. The institute was founded as a merger of the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation (Dutch: &quot;Nederlands instituut voor oorlogsdocumentatie&quot;, NIOD, formerly National Institute for War Documentation, Dutch: &quot;Rijksinstituut voor oorlogsdocumentatie&quot;, RIOD) and the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies (CHGS).

It has been part of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1 January 1999.

==Mission==
According to its website, the NIOD Institute&#x27;s mission is to:

It administers the archives of the German occupation of the Netherlands and the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, as well as large collections of clandestine newspapers and pamphlets, photographs, books and articles.

==Studies and publications==
The institute published The Kingdom of the Netherlands During World War II (Dutch: &quot;Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog&quot;) in fourteen volumes and 18,000 pages. This magnum opus of Loe de Jong is the standard reference on the history of the Netherlands during World War II. The NIOD had recently made an electronic edition of the entire work, available for downloading from 11 December 2011, licensed under creative commons CC BY 3.0.

It also performed a study into the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, which led to the report , which led to the resignation of the second cabinet of Wim Kok.

<text>Abraham Gottlob Werner (; 25 September 174930 June 1817) was a German geologist who set out an early theory about the stratification of the Earth&#x27;s crust and propounded a history of the Earth that came to be known as Neptunism. While most tenets of Neptunism were eventually set aside, Werner is remembered for his demonstration of chronological succession in rocks; for the zeal with which he infused his pupils; and for the impulse he thereby gave to the study of geology. He has been called the &quot;father of German geology&quot;.

== Life ==

Werner was born in Wehrau (now Osiecznica, Lower Silesian Voivodeship), a village in Prussian Silesia. His family had been involved in the mining industry for many years. His father, Abraham David Werner, was a foreman at a foundry in Wehrau.

Werner was educated at Freiberg and Leipzig, where he studied law and mining, and was then appointed as Inspector and Teacher of Mining and Mineralogy at the small, but influential, Freiberg Mining Academy in 1775.

While in Leipzig, Werner became interested in the systematic identification and classification of minerals. Within a year he published the first modern textbook on descriptive mineralogy, &quot;Von den äusserlichen Kennzeichen der Fossilien&quot; (On the External Characters of Fossils [or of Minerals]; 1774).

During his career, Werner published very little, but his fame as a teacher spread throughout Europe, attracting students, who became virtual disciples, and spread his interpretations throughout their homelands, e.g. Robert Jameson who became professor at Edinburgh and Andrés Manuel del Río who discovered vanadium. Socratic in his lecturing style, Werner developed an appreciation for the broader implications and interrelations of geology within his students, who provided an enthusiastic and attentive audience. Werner&#x27;s students Friedrich Mohs (who was in 1818 also successor to Werner&#x27;s chair at the Freiberg Mining Academy), Robert Jameson and G. Mitchell even had plans to establish an institute analogous to Freiberg Mining Academy in Dublin, which were due to the death of some people involved never carried out. 

Werner was plagued by frail health his entire life, and passed a quiet existence in the immediate environs of Freiberg. An avid mineral collector in his youth, he abandoned field work altogether in his later life. There is no evidence that he had ever traveled beyond Saxony in his entire adult life. He died at Dresden from internal complications said to have been caused by his consternation over the misfortunes that had befallen Saxony during the Napoleonic Wars. He is buried in the Neuen Annenfriedhof in south-west Dresden. The grave is marked by a simple boulder inscribed with his name.

He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1810.

== Werner&#x27;s theory ==
Starting from the pre-existing traditions of stratigraphy and cosmogony in Europe, Werner applied superposition in a classification similar to that of Johann Gottlob Lehmann. He believed that the Earth could be divided into five formations:

# Primitive (&quot;Urgebirge&quot;) Series: intrusive igneous rocks and high rank metasediments considered to be the first precipitates from the ocean before the emergence of land.
# Transition (&quot;Übergangsgebirge&quot;) Series: more indurated limestones, dikes, sills, and thick sequences of greywackes that were the first orderly deposits from the ocean. These were &quot;universal&quot; formations extending without interruption around the world.
# Secondary or Stratified (&quot;Flötz&quot;) Series: the remaining, stratified fossiliferous rocks and certain associated &quot;trap&quot; rocks. These were thought to represent the emergence of mountains from beneath the ocean and were formed from the resulting products of erosion deposited on their flanks.
# Alluvial or Tertiary (&quot;Aufgeschwemmte&quot;) Series: poorly consolidated sands, gravels, and clays formed by the withdrawal of the oceans from the continents.
# Volcanic Series : younger lava flows demonstrably associated with volcanic vents. Werner believed that these rocks reflected the local effects of burning coal beds.

The basic concept of Wernerian geology was the belief in an all encompassing ocean that gradually receded to its present location while precipitating or depositing almost all the rocks and minerals in the Earth&#x27;s crust. The emphasis on this initially universal ocean spawned the term &quot;Neptunism&quot; that became applied to the concept and it became virtually synonymous with Wernerian teaching, although Jean-Étienne Guettard in France actually originated the view. A universal ocean led directly to the idea of universal formations, which Werner believed could be recognized on the basis of lithology and superposition. He coined the term &quot;geognosy&quot; (meaning &quot;knowledge of the Earth&quot;) to define a science based on the recognition of the order, position, and relation of the layers forming the Earth. Werner believed that geognosy represented fact and not theory. His followers resisted speculation, and as a result Wernerian geognosy and Neptunism became dogma and ceased to contribute to further understanding of the history of the Earth.

His former student Robert Jameson, who later became Regius Professor at the University of Edinburgh, founded the Wernerian Natural History Society in 1808 in honour of Werner, which, while debating many aspects of natural history, was a bastion of the Wernerian view of the Earth.

== Criticism ==

A principal focus of Neptunism that provoked almost immediate controversy involved the origin of basalt. Basalts, particularly formed as sills, were differentiated from surface lava flows, and the two were not recognized as the same rock type by Werner and his students during this period. Lavas and volcanoes of igneous origin were treated as very recent phenomena unrelated to the universal ocean that formed the layers of the Earth. Werner believed that volcanoes only occurred in proximity to coal beds. Burning melted overlying basalts and wackes, producing basalts and lavas typically at low elevations. Basalt at higher elevations proved to Werner that they were chemical precipitates of the ocean.

A second controversy surrounding Neptunism involved the volumetric problems associated with the universal ocean. How could he account for the covering of the entire Earth and then the shrinking of the ocean volume as the primitive and transitional mountains emerged and the secondary and tertiary deposits were formed? The movement of a significant volume of water into the Earth&#x27;s interior had been proposed by the classical Greek geographer Strabo, but it was not embraced by Werner because it was associated with conjecture. Nevertheless, with his views on basalt, he did not believe that the interior of the Earth was molten. Werner appears to have dodged the question for the most part. He thought that some of the water could have been lost to space with the passing of some celestial body. That interpretation, however, raised the related question of explaining the return of the waters reflected in the secondary rocks.

== Legacy ==

Werner&#x27;s ability as a lecturer attracted students from all over Europe. Applications of his ideas fomented debate, particularly over the origin of basalt, in the so-called Neptunist-Plutonist controversy. Among his most famous students was Alexander von Humboldt, who stayed in Freiberg in 1791-92, and initially subscribed to Werner&#x27;s Neptunist ideas before departing from them in his later years.

The variety of scapolite known as wernerite is named in his honour. Werner is credited with coining the term geognosy, for the geological study of the Earth&#x27;s structure, specifically its exterior and interior construction.

In 1805, he described the mineral zoisite and named it after Sigmund Zois, who sent him its specimens from Saualpe in Carinthia.

Werner’s major work, &quot;Von den äußerlichen Kennzeichen der Foßilien&quot; (1774), contained a comprehensive colour scheme he had devised for the description and classification of minerals. The work, incorporating this colour nomenclature with some modifications, was translated into French by Claudine Guyton de Morveau (née Picardet) in 1790 and into English by Thomas Weaver in 1805. Patrick Syme (1774–1845), painter to the Wernerian and Horticultural Societies of Edinburgh, published in 1814 a revised version, entitled &quot;Werner&#x27;s Nomenclature of Colours, with Additions, arranged so as to render it useful to the Arts and Sciences&quot;. In Germany, the scheme was favoured, for example, by the young polymath Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg) (1772–1801), who was impressed by its analytical character.

The Werner Mountains in Antarctica and the Werner Range in Greenland were named after him.

<text>Cambrils () is a coastal town in the comarca of Baix Camp, province of Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain. The town is near the tourist town Salou and is frequently visited by those travelling by air using Reus Airport.

==History==

===Roman Empire to Middle Ages===
The town of Cambrils can trace its origins back to prehistoric times, although it was not until the Roman Empire period that the present town of Cambrils began to grow. This is evident from the archaeological sites found throughout the municipality, such as the Roman villa of &quot;La Llosa&quot;, strategically located alongside the Via Augusta and not far from the Roman capital of Tarraco.

By the mediaeval period, there was already a permanent settlement on the right bank of the Alforja Torrent. From 1152, the kingdom of Aragon, having driven the Moors out of Catalonia, granted a series of privileges to encourage the repopulation of the place known as Cambrils. It was in the 12th century that the foundations were laid for the establishment of a stable population centre here at the southern gateway to the Camp de Tarragona, well connected to El Camino Real (the Royal Road) that linked Tortosa and Tarragona. The area also had good maritime connections; indeed, the troops of Jaume I sailed from these beaches in 1229 to re-conquer Majorca from the Moors.

Due to this strategic position, the Crown kept title over the town by establishing a feudal lord—vassal to the king-count—and a detachment of soldiers here. In addition, they built defensive walls and towers that also served to protect other nearby villages such as Els Tegells, Les Planes and Montbrió. This royal initiative lead to the development of the present-day Old Town, with a church, hostel, hermitage, hospital, convent, market, fair, artisans, and, above all, farmers who worked the rich lands surrounding Cambrils.

However, the vitality of the community was severely disrupted in December 1640 when the town of Cambrils was the site of one of the episodes of the Reapers&#x27; War (Guerra dels Segadors) that brought Catalonia into conflict with King Philip IV of Spain. Faced with a far superior army, the population of Cambrils withstood a siege that lasted three days, before they finally capitulated. Contrary to the agreed terms of surrender, the occupying troops killed a large number of the defenders and destroyed most of the town walls. This is one of the most important events in the town&#x27;s history and it is commemorated every year by a ceremony held in the &quot;Plaça del Setge&quot; (Siege Square), in front of the ruins of the walls.

From the 18th century the population began to increase, as can be seen from the establishment of workers&#x27; neighbourhoods outside the walled area. At the same time, the coastal area, now the port quarter of Cambrils, was also occupied, thanks to the construction of the Port or Moors&#x27; Tower. For centuries living on the seashore had been fraught with danger, due to constant pirate attacks. Fishermen and others who did not have time to flee to the shelter of the walled town were often killed or kidnapped. Other small mediaeval villages such as Mas d&#x27;en Bisbe, Vilagrassa and Vilafortuny, the latter of which had its own castle and church, also suffered the ravages of the pirates, which impeded the growth of their populations, a situation that did not change until they were annexed to the municipality of Cambrils in the 19th century. Over time, and with the danger largely a thing of the past, the families of fishermen and seafarers began to build their houses around the Port or Moors&#x27; Tower, thus founding the quarter that, a century later, would see the construction of the harbour, which was finished in the mid 20th century and is now the best known symbol of Cambrils.

In addition to the production of flour in the town&#x27;s numerous water-driven mills, from the 19th century on small industries began to develop. These included liqueur producers, brick and building material factories, and boatyards building increasingly large vessels. The opening of the railway in 1867 gave a considerable boost to the town&#x27;s commerce, agriculture and fishing, despite a series of wars, epidemics, and meteorological disasters suffered during the 19th century. The 20th century brought with it the beginning of an increase in population that would be multiplied in the 1950s with the arrival of various waves of immigration from other parts of Spain.

At the beginning of the 1960s the potential of tourism to the town was realized and began to be exploited. Large estates were built to house these new arrivals, who mainly came to enjoy the Mediterranean sun, beach and cuisine.

At dawn on August 18, 2017, an Audi A-3 with five terrorists drove into the crowd that was walking along the Cambrils seafront. Subsequently, the car overturned, the terrorists got out and began stabbing passersby. The five terrorists were killed by the Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra, leaving one woman dead in their wake and six other people injured, three of them police officers. Later it became apparent that the cell killed in Cambrils had a connection with the attack the day before in Las Ramblas in Barcelona.

== Economy ==
The city, along with the rest of the region around Tarragona, has enjoyed very rapid development over the last two decades. The town&#x27;s fishing and agriculture background is being replaced by such emerging industries as chemical, petrochemical, services and tourism. These, in turn, have spurred large-scale development, leading to major investments in infrastructure and an increased standard of living. Today, most of the tourists to this area are Spaniards, who have their summer house at this fishing village with high quality beaches.

The Agriculture Cooperative of Cambrils was founded at 1902. Nowadays it is the agriculture and food industry reference around Camp de Tarragona. The local farmers produce fruits, vegetables, and arbequina olives, from which is made the well-known Extra Virgin Olive Oil PDO Siurana. This product has been awarded as Best Olive Oil of Spain in Fruity Category by the Agriculture Ministry of Spain and Best Olive Oil Mill of Spain (2005–2006) awarded by the Spanish Association of Municipalities of the Olive Tree (AEMO).

He also studied at the Center for Higher Military Studies. During his university days he was a member of the Christian Social Student Front.

His brother was Eduardo Ferrero Costa who is the former Ambassador (and former Minister of Foreign Affairs under the Fujimori Administration) in the United States.

Ferrero died on 31 January 2025, at the age of 83.

In the 2000 elections, he ran for First Vice President as the running mate of Alejandro Toledo in his Perú Posible ticket but the ticket lost to Alberto Fujimori’s Peru 2000 ticket. Nevertheless, he was re-elected to the Congress. In late-2000, after the resignation of Fujimori, he ran against Valentín Paniagua for the Presidency of the Peruvian Congress. He lost the election, and Paniagua claimed his position as Interim President of Peru. He would then become President of the Congress in 2000, and was reaffirmed in 2001 and 2002 and served until 2003.

Ferrero became Prime Minister on 15 December 2003. On 13 January 2004, he appeared before the Congress of the Republic to present the general policy of the government and ask for the vote of confidence (or also called the investiture). Ferrero addressed the congressmen and announced that the government would meet the growing social demands and that it would follow the lines that the Toledo government proposed since July 2001: improving institutions, reducing poverty, strengthening trade and the economy, reform and modernization of the State and fight against corruption. Ferrero emphasized the reform of the State to combat corruption, the realignment of public resources. Ferrero announced the proposal to modify the Organic Law of the Executive Power, the draft Framework Law of Public Employment, the Law of incompatibilities and prohibitions for the exercise of public function, the law of the Public Employment Remuneration System. He also announced that they would promote the simplification of procedures, decentralization, private investment, education, social programs, among others. At the end of his presentation, Ferrero raised the question of confidence, which obtained 49 votes in favor, 6 against and 44 abstentions.

He resigned abruptly on 11 August 2005, when president Alejandro Toledo appointed Fernando Olivera as Minister of Foreign Affairs. He failed to attain re-election in the 2006 elections.

<text>A slip-turn is a maneuver in which an aircraft turns using only the rudder. In most aircraft, the presence of a fixed vertical stabilizer complicates the maneuver. However, in those in which the whole of the vertical stabilizer comprises the rudder, such as the Fokker Dr.I triplane, the aircraft can be made to effectively skid in the horizontal plane, a technique employed by the German World War I ace Josef Jacobs to great effect, and which Werner Voss used in his final combat.

<text>John Leonard Olson (May 22, 1910 – October 12, 1985) was an American radio personality and television announcer. Olson is perhaps best known for his work as an announcer for game shows, particularly the work he did for Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions. Olson was the longtime announcer for the original &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, and spent over a decade as the announcer for both &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, working on the latter series at the time of his death.

==Early career==
Some of Olson&#x27;s earliest radio work occurred in the mid 1930&#x27;s at WTMJ in Milwaukee, where he appeared on the variety show &quot;The Grenadiers&quot;. He soon was hosting &quot;Johnny Olson Rhythm Rascals&quot;, where callers would request songs for him to sing. His future wife Penny was a frequent caller to the show. Olson&#x27;s first network job on radio was in New York City in 1944, hosting (with his wife) the audience-participation show &quot;Ladies Be Seated&quot;, a stunt game along the lines of &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;, broadcast on ABC Radio. From 1950-1951 Olson was the host of &quot;Johnny Olson&#x27;s Luncheon Club&quot;, which was the follow-up replacement for &quot;Ladies Be Seated&quot;. He had previously hosted several radio shows in Chicago, including the second iteration of &quot;Johnny Olson&#x27;s Rumpus Room&quot;, a late-night variety show broadcast from 10:30 p.m. to midnight, which was also the name of a later daytime talk show he hosted on the DuMont Television Network.

==Work for DuMont Television Network==
In 1945, Olson and his wife hosted a five-week run of a TV version of &quot;Ladies Be Seated&quot;. From May 1947 to July 1949, Olson hosted &quot;Doorway to Fame&quot;, an evening television talent show on the new DuMont Television Network. From January 1949 to July 1952, Olson hosted &quot;Johnny Olson&#x27;s Rumpus Room&quot;, a daytime television talk show which was the first daytime show broadcast from DuMont&#x27;s flagship station WABD over DuMont&#x27;s small East Coast network. Olson also hosted the Saturday-morning children&#x27;s show &quot;Kids and Company&quot; on DuMont from September 1951 to June 1952, with co-host Ham Fisher.

==Early announcing work==
On television, Olson was an announcer on &quot;Break the Bank&quot; and was the announcer and sometimes the host on &quot;Fun for the Money&quot; on ABC-TV in 1949. Olson also was the announcer for &quot;Play Your Hunch&quot;.

Olson was host of &quot;Homemaker&#x27;s Jamboree&quot;, an audience-participation game show that debuted on WJZ-TV on October 5, 1952.

Beginning in 1960, Olson announced the CBS prime-time panel game &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. The following year, he added duties on sister show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, and in 1962 began announcing on the original &quot;Match Game&quot; in daytime on NBC until that series ended in 1969. Before going live, Olson did an audience warm-up by asking questions and getting the audience ready for the live telecast.

Twice, in 1965 and again in 1974, he appeared as the mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. The first time he managed to stump the panel; the second time, Arlene Francis guessed his identity.

Olson was also the announcer for &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; from 1962 until its cancellation in 1970.

Olson continued to announce &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; after both shows moved from CBS to syndication in the late 1960s. His involvement with those shows ended when he was designated announcer of the 1972 revivals of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, both of which were taped in Hollywood, where he relocated.

He was the announcer for five of The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethons from 1966 to 1970.

==&quot;The Price Is Right&quot;==
Although &quot;Name That Tune&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;Match Game&quot; put Olson in the elite class of television game-show announcers, the revival of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; cemented Olson&#x27;s fame. In addition to serving as host Bob Barker&#x27;s sidekick, Olson was a beloved and valued member of the &quot;cast&quot;. He warmed up the audiences prior to taping; during taping, he often received on-camera exposure (occasionally bantering with Barker) prior to calling out the contestants&#x27; names. He also frequently appeared in the showcases.

His exhortation for contestants to &quot;Come on down!&quot; became a catchphrase, and a &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; tradition observed by his successors Rod Roddy (1986–2003), Rich Fields (2004–2010) and George Gray (2011–present).

==&quot;Match Game&quot; and later career==
Olson began announcing for the revived &quot;Match Game&quot;. 

During the 1970s and early 1980s, during the peak of his announcing duties on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;Match Game&quot;, he worked on several other Goodson-Todman game shows. He announced:
He also filled in for:

==Death==
On October 6, 1985, Olson suffered a stroke and was taken to St. John&#x27;s Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, California, where he died October 12, 1985, at age 75. The funeral services for Johnny Olson immediately followed. Shortly afterwards, Bob Barker paid tribute to him at the end of the remaining episodes of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; that were taped with Olson as announcer before he died:

Following was a portrait of Olson and a message saying &quot;In Memoriam 1910-1985&quot;.

<text>The University of Illinois Springfield (UIS) is a public university in Springfield, Illinois, United States. The university was established by the Illinois General Assembly in 1969 as Sangamon State University with a focus on post-graduate education. It became the third member of the University of Illinois system on July 1, 1995. The university serves 4,198 students as of fall 2022 with 56 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 39 minors, 44 master&#x27;s degrees, one doctoral degree, 37 graduate certificates, and coursework that leads to six ISBE endorsements.

The university now also includes a liberal arts college and is a member of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges. UIS is also a member of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities and the American Council on Education. The campus&#x27; main repository, Brookens Library, holds a collection of nearly 800,000 books and serials in addition to accessible resources at the University of Illinois Chicago and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campuses.

==History==

===Sangamon State University (1967–1995)===
In 1967, the Illinois General Assembly created a Board of Regents to operate Illinois State University and Northern Illinois University, as well as a third unnamed institution in Springfield. In 1969, Governor Richard Ogilvie signed into law a bill officially creating Sangamon State University. It originally operated as an &quot;upper-division&quot; university—that is, a university that offers only the last two years of undergraduate education, as well as graduate work. The first classes were held on September 28, 1970, at the former Hotel Leland in downtown Springfield. In October, SSU began offering classes in the current campus location near Lake Springfield.

Sangamon State aimed to be a &quot;truly pioneering segment of public education&quot; through a spirit of openness, innovation and adaptability.

The school grew steadily over the years. Its first permanent building, Brookens Library, was dedicated in 1976, and its Public Affairs Center and first dormitories opened in 1980.

===University of Illinois Springfield (1995–present)===
In 1995, Governor Jim Edgar signed a bill which abolished the Board of Regents and merged SSU with the University of Illinois system. On July 1, SSU officially became the University of Illinois Springfield. Naomi Lynn, the last president of SSU, became the first chancellor of UIS.

In 2001, it admitted freshmen for the first time in an honors program called the &quot;Capital Scholars&quot;. On September 8, 2005, the University of Illinois Board of Trustees approved a new general education curriculum, making UIS a full-fledged four-year university for the first time. Freshmen were slated to be admitted under the general education curriculum beginning in fall 2006.

==Campus==
The University of Illinois Springfield is located six miles southeast of Springfield, occupying 740 acres of prairie land adjacent to Lake Springfield and Lincoln Land Community College. In 1841, the land was acquired by Thomas Strawbridge Jr., a prosperous saddler and harness maker in Springfield. The Thomas Strawbridge homestead, constructed around 1845, still stands on the south edge of the University of Illinois Springfield campus and was restored in 2012.

Today, there are three easily identifiable areas on campus: Legacy Campus, SSU Permanent Construction, and the University of Illinois era. The first permanent construction on campus, Brookens Library was completed in 1976 and the Public Affairs Center, was completed in Fall of 1980. These buildings were the first part of a master plan of 1970–1971 that called for an &quot;urban campus&quot; surrounded by restored prairie land, free of all vehicular traffic and easily navigable by pedestrians. All permanent campus buildings would be located within a &quot;ring road&quot;, now known as University Drive. The Public Affairs Center also houses Sangamon Auditorium, a 2,018 seat concert hall and performing arts center built in 1981. It occupies the entire second level of the Public Affairs Center.

===Legacy Campus===
The Legacy Campus hosts an array of student services and facilities buildings. There is also the Cox Children&#x27;s Center which was established in 1970. Some of the key buildings on this part of campus are the WUIS building, Student Life Building (SLB), Business Services Building (BSB), Human Resources Building (HRB), Student Affairs Building (SAB), and the Visual &amp; Performing Arts Building (VPA).
===Residence life===
UIS offers four living options for more than 1,100 students. On the East Campus there are four courts of apartments, one being designated for family housing including Sunflower, Larkspur, CLover, and Bluebell Courts. There is also the housing office at Homer L. Butler Commons (HCOM). On West Campus there are 96 townhouses encompassed within Pennyroyal, Marigold, Trillium and Foxglove court. For first and second year students there are two residence halls, Lincoln Residence Hall (LRH) and Founders Residence Hall (FRH).

==Academics==
The University of Illinois Springfield has been offering online courses and degrees since 1999. Currently UIS offers 56 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 39 minors, 44 master&#x27;s degree, one doctoral degree, 37 graduate certificates and coursework that leads to six ISBE endorsements.

<text>Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch (or Besikovitch; ; 23 January 1891 – 2 November 1970) was a Russian mathematician, who worked mainly in England. He was born in Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov (now in Ukraine) to a Karaite Jewish family.

==Life and career==
Abram Besicovitch studied under the supervision of Andrey Markov at the St. Petersburg University, graduating with a PhD in 1912. He then began research in probability theory. He converted to Eastern Orthodoxy, joining the Russian Orthodox Church, on marrying in 1916. He was appointed professor at the University of Perm in 1917, and was caught up in the Russian Civil War over the next two years. In 1920, he took a position at the Petrograd University.

In 1924, he went to Copenhagen on a Rockefeller Fellowship, where he worked on almost periodic functions under Harald Bohr. A type of function space in that field now bears his name. After a visit to G.H. Hardy at the University of Oxford, he had appointments at the University of Liverpool in 1926, and the University of Cambridge in 1927.

Besicovitch moved to Cambridge University in 1927. In 1950, he was appointed to the Rouse Ball Chair of Mathematics. In 1958, he retired and toured the US for eight years. After returning to Trinity College Cambridge, he died in 1970. He was appointed Lecturer in the Faculty of Mathematics, and therefore received recognition as a Cambridge MA by &#x27;Special Grace&#x27; on 24 November 1928. He worked mainly on combinatorial methods and questions in real analysis, such as the Kakeya needle problem and the Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension. These two particular areas have proved increasingly important as the years have gone by. The Kovner–Besicovitch measure of the central symmetry of planar convex sets is also named after him.

He was also a major influence on the economist Piero Sraffa, after 1940, when they were both Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, and on Dennis Lindley, one of the founders of the Bayesian movement in the United Kingdom. He was J.E. Littlewood&#x27;s successor in 1950 in the Rouse Ball chair at the University of Cambridge, retiring in 1958. He died in Cambridge.

==Awards and honours==
Besicovitch was in 1934 made FRS and in 1952 won the Sylvester Medal from the Royal Society. He received in 1950 the &quot;De Morgan Medal&quot; of the London Mathematical Society. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in the fall of 1954.

Besicovitch&#x27;s candidacy for the Royal Society reads:

The asteroid &quot;16953 Besicovitch&quot; is named in his honour.

A portrait of Besicovitch by Eve Goldsmith Coxeter is in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge.

<text>The University of New Mexico (UNM; ) is a public research university in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States. Founded in 1889 by the New Mexico Territorial Legislature, it is the state&#x27;s second oldest university, a flagship university in the state, and the largest by enrollment, with 22,630 students in 2023.

UNM comprises twelve colleges and schools, including a medical school and the only law school in New Mexico. It offers 215 degree and certificate programs, including 94 baccalaureate, 71 master, and 37 doctoral degree programs. The main campus spans in central Albuquerque, with branch campuses in Gallup, Los Alamos, Rio Rancho, Taos, and Los Lunas.

UNM is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities - very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, it spent over $243 million on research and development in 2021, ranking 103rd in the U.S. UNM is classified as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) by the U.S. Department of Education, with nearly half its students being Hispanic.

UNM&#x27;s 16 varsity sports programs, known as the Lobos, compete in NCAA Division I (FBS for football) and are members of the Mountain West Conference; the school has won national championships in skiing and cross country running. UNM&#x27;s official colors are cherry and silver. The school has approximately 200,000 alumni worldwide.

==History==
===Founding===

The University of New Mexico was founded on February 28, 1889, with the passage of House Bill No. 186 by the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of New Mexico, which stipulated that:
Said institution is hereby located at or near the town of Albuquerque, in the county of Bernalillo within two miles north of railroad avenue in said town, upon a tract of good high and dry land, of not less than twenty acres suitable for the purposes of such institution.
The act also provided that UNM was &quot;intended to be the state University when New Mexico shall [be] admitted as a state into the Union&quot;. Bernard Shandon Rodey, a judge of the territory of New Mexico, pushed for Albuquerque as the location of the university and was one of the authors of the statute that created UNM, earning him the title of &quot;Father of the University&quot;. Two years later, Elias S. Stover became the first president of the University and the following year the university&#x27;s first building, Hodgin Hall, opened.

===Early growth===

The third president of UNM, William G. Tight, who served from 1901 to 1909, introduced many programs for students and faculty, including the first fraternity and sorority. Tight introduced the Pueblo Revival architecture for which the campus has become known. During Tight&#x27;s term, the first Pueblo Revival style building on campus, the Estufa, was constructed, and the Victorian-style Hodgin Hall was plastered over to create a monument to Pueblo Indian culture. However, Tight was vilified for his primitivism and was removed from office for political reasons, though history would vindicate him as the Pueblo Revival style became the dominant architectural style on campus.

Under David Ross Boyd, the university&#x27;s fifth president, the campus was enlarged from 20 to and a federal land grant was made to the university. In 1922, the university was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. During this time, more facilities were constructed for the university, but it was under the tenure of James F. Zimmerman, the university&#x27;s seventh president, that the university underwent its first major expansion. Under Zimmerman, many new buildings were constructed, student enrollment increased, new departments were added, and greater support was generated for scientific research. Among the new buildings constructed were Zimmerman Library, Scholes Hall, the first student union building (now the anthropology complex), the university&#x27;s first gymnasium and its first stadium. John Gaw Meem, an architect based in Santa Fe, was contracted to design many of the buildings constructed during this period and is credited with imbuing the campus with its distinctive Pueblo Revival style.

===World War II and beyond===

During World War II, UNM was one of 131 U.S. colleges and universities that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

In 1945, the university hired John Philip Wernette to be its eighth president. Upon arrival, Wernette focused on improving the university&#x27;s faculty, programs, and services. He instituted an eighteen-point program of procedures for the selection of new faculty and appointed a committee to ensure better teaching candidates for faculty members. He also developed a program for faculty advancement. Offices of the General Placement Bureau, Veterans Assistance, and Testing and Counseling Services were formed to assist students and Wernette required all seniors in 1946 to take the Graduate Record Examinations test to provide the school with a measurement of how well it was educating its students. The university started the Law School and School of Business Administration during his tenure.

In 1947, Wernette came into conflict with the Board of Regents over the hiring of two faculty members he thought were unqualified. His contract was not renewed by the Board the following year. Thomas L. Popejoy was appointed in 1948 as Wernette&#x27;s successor, being the first native New Mexican to serve as university president. Holding his position for the next twenty years, Popejoy presided over a period major growth for the university. During this time, enrollment jumped from nearly 5,000 to more than 14,000; new programs such as medicine, nursing, dental, and law were founded; and numerous new facilities were constructed, including Mesa Vista Hall, Mitchell Hall, Johnson Gymnasium, new dormitories, the current student union building, the College of Education complex, the business center, the engineering complex, the Fine Arts Center, the Student Health Center, University Stadium, University Arena (now officially known by its nickname of The Pit), and North Campus. This period also saw the foundation of UNM&#x27;s branch facilities in Los Alamos and Gallup and the acquisition of the D.H. Lawrence Ranch north of Taos.

During the early 1970s, two sit-in protests at UNM led to a response from law enforcement officers. On May 5, 1970, protestors against the Vietnam War and the Kent State massacre occupied the Student Union Building. The National Guard was ordered to sweep the building and arrest those inside; eleven students and journalists were bayonetted when those outside did not hear the order to disperse given inside. On May 10, 1972, a peaceful sit-in protest near Kirtland Air Force Base led to the arrest of thirty-five people and was pushed back to UNM, leading to eight more arrests. The following day, tear gas was used against hundreds of demonstrators on campus and the situation continued to deteriorate, leading the university to declare a state of emergency.
New programs and schools were created in the 1970s and the university gained control over the hospital on North Campus. New facilities for the medical and law schools were constructed on North Campus and new Main Campus buildings were constructed on the site of the now demolished Zimmerman Field, including Ortega Hall, Woodward Hall, the Humanities building, and the Art building. The campus also underwent a new landscaping plan, which included the construction of the duck pond west of Zimmerman Library and the conversion of many streets to pedestrian malls in order to make a more pedestrian-friendly campus.

At the end of the decade, the university was implicated in a recruiting scandal dubbed &quot;Lobogate&quot; by the press. An FBI wiretap on the phone of a prominent Lobo booster recorded a conversation in which basketball head coach Norm Ellenberger arranged with assistant coach Manny Goldstein to transfer bogus credits from a California junior college to the office of the UNM registrar. Subsequent investigation turned up a manufactured college seal from Mercer County Community College in New Jersey, along with blank transcripts and records of previous forgery. Further investigation uncovered alleged incentives like cars and apartments doled out to prime players and exposed a vast network of sports gambling. The scandal forced Ellenberger to resign and defined the term of William E. Davis, UNM&#x27;s eleventh president.

===Recent history===

The university has continued to grow, with expanding enrollment and new facilities. In the 1980s, dramatic expansion occurred at the medical center, business school, and engineering school. The Centennial Library was also constructed. During the 1990s, an Honors College was founded, and the university completed construction of a new bookstore and Dane Smith Hall. The Research Park at South Campus was also expanded.

By this point, the university had one of the largest student and faculty populations of Hispanics and Native Americans in the country. A study released in 1995 showed that the number of full-time Hispanic faculty at UNM was four times greater than the national average and the number of Native American teachers five times greater. The schools of law and business had some of the largest Hispanic student populations of any university in the country.

In the first decade of the 2000s, major expansion began on medical facilities on North Campus. The current visitor center, a new engineering center, and George Pearl Hall were constructed. Renovations and expansions were undertaken on several buildings on Main Campus, along with the creation of a branch campus in Rio Rancho. This wave of construction is continuing at present with more projects ongoing.

In 2016, UNM was the first university in the country to launch a Signature School Program with the Central Intelligence Agency, which enables students to interact with analysts and learn how to join the CIA once they graduate.

In 2017, the campus became smoke and tobacco free, with the exception of a few designated smoking areas located near the residence halls. The New Mexico Department of Health assisted in the effort, paying for signs and stickers around campus as well as a PSA shown during orientation.

Into the 21st century, UNM has become a major contributor to New Mexico&#x27;s burgeoning bioscience sector: The university&#x27;s health sciences and biomedical engineering programs have helped launch 39 health-related startups since 2013, as well as 40 tech startups during the same period. Bioscience ventures accounted for 17 of 29 companies, or 58%, that formed from UNM-based research and technology between 2019 and 2022. The school has launched several programs and initiatives aimed at fostering more technology startups, often in collaboration with local, state, and federal agencies as well as other southwestern universities. In 2021, the Directed Energy Center at UNM became established hrough a cooperative agreement with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).

On April 22, 2024, UNM students joined other campuses across the United States in protests and establishing encampments against the Israel–Hamas war and the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. There was support from faculty for the protests, and Jewish participants celebrated Passover. However police were called in and made arrests, which led to injuries to students.

==Campus==

UNM&#x27;s main campus is located on in Albuquerque on the heights a mile east of Downtown Albuquerque. It is split in three parts – central, north, and south. The central campus is situated between Central Avenue on the south, Girard Boulevard on the east, Lomas Boulevard on the north, and University Boulevard on the west, and is home to the main academic university. The North Campus, which includes the medical, nursing, pharmacological, and law schools as well as the University of New Mexico Hospital, is located on the north side of Lomas across from the central campus. The South campus is located a mile south of the central campus, centered around the intersection of University Boulevard and Avenida César Chavez, and includes most of UNM&#x27;s athletic facilities. The central campus is noted for its unique Pueblo Revival architectural style, with many of the buildings designed by former university architect John Gaw Meem, who is credited with imbuing the campus with its distinctive Southwestern feel. The central campus is also home to the University of New Mexico Arboretum, which contains some 320 species of woody plants.
Eight university buildings are listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places, including Hodgin Hall, the university&#x27;s first building, and two adjacent structures, the Art Annex and Sara Reynolds Hall. The Estufa, one of the first Pueblo Revival style structures in the country and the first on campus, is also on the list. Other structures on the registry are Carlisle Gymnasium, Jonson Gallery, Scholes Hall, and the University House.

The central campus is home to four museums: the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology in the anthropology building, the Silver Family Geology Museum and the Meteorite Museum which are located in Northrop Hall, the Museum of Southwestern Biology in the CERIA building, and the University Art Museum in the Center for the Arts.

In an effort to promote sustainability and lessen the environmental impact of the campus, UNM has been reducing the campus energy usage through monitoring and retrofitting cooling, heating, water, and lighting technologies. Due to these efforts, the university&#x27;s grade on the College Sustainability Report Card 2009 improved from a &quot;C&quot; to a &quot;B&quot; according to the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Since 2008, following an executive order that all new state buildings over must meet LEED silver at minimum, all new construction on campus has been registered for LEED status. So far, an expansion of Castetter Hall and the Technology and Education Center are the only LEED-certified buildings on campus, with a Gold and Platinum rating respectively. Several other buildings are currently registered for LEED status.
===Libraries===

The primary UNM library units are the Health Sciences Library and Informatics Center, the Law Library, and the University Libraries, which consists of:
* Centennial Science and Engineering Library
* Center for Southwest Research (special collections and archives—housed in Zimmerman Library)
* Fine Arts and Design Library
* Parish Memorial Business and Economics Library
* Zimmerman Library (for humanities and social sciences)

==Academics==
The University of New Mexico offers more than 215 degree and certificate programs, including 94 baccalaureate, 71 masters and 37 doctoral degrees, through 12 colleges and schools:

===Rankings===

In its list of &quot;Best Colleges&quot; in the U.S. for 2022, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UNM as tied for 212th among national universities, tied for 107th among public universities, and tied at 90th for &quot;Top Performers on Social Mobility&quot;. Several graduate programs are highly ranked nationally, including family medicine (7th), graduate clinical training (8th), nuclear engineering (14th), and primary care (16th); among the graduate programs in the top 100 nationwide are electrical engineering (63), computer engineering (69), chemical engineering (77), and physics (77).

UNM ranks 8th in the &quot;Military Friendly&quot; rating, which denotes institutions that excel in accommodating, aiding, and retaining students who are military veterans.

===Undergraduate admissions===
Undergraduate admission to UNM is rated &quot;selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report,&quot; with an acceptance rate of 65% according to &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;. For Fall 2019, the school received 12,181 freshmen applications, of which 5,973 were admitted (49.0%) and 2,594 enrolled. The average GPA of enrolled freshmen was 3.44, while the middle 50% range of SAT composite scores were 1000–1290, 520–640 for evidence-based reading and writing, and 520–630 for math. The middle 50% range of the ACT Composite score was 19–25.

==Athletics==
UNM&#x27;s NCAA Division I program (FBS for football) offers 18 varsity sports. The teams are known as the Lobos, who compete in the Mountain West Conference. Two human mascots, referred to as Louie Lobo and Lucy Lobo, rouse crowds at New Mexico athletic events. The official school colors are cherry and silver. The Lobos have won national championships in skiing and cross country running.

===Rivalries===

UNM maintains strong athletic rivalries with New Mexico State University. The UNM-NMSU rivalry is called the Rio Grande Rivalry, a competitive series based on points awarded to the winners of head-to-head competitions between the two universities in every sport. A rotating trophy is granted to the winning university for a period of one year, until the award presentation the following year. The rivalry is celebrated at UNM by the Red Rally, a large bonfire that takes place the Thursday before the UNM-NMSU football game.

===Basketball===

The Lobo men&#x27;s basketball team is famous for its venue, The Pit. It may be best known as the site of the 1983 NCAA basketball championship, in which North Carolina State University, coached by Jim Valvano, upset the University of Houston.

The UNM women&#x27;s basketball team has won the Mountain West championship for four of the past five years, and have gone to the NCAA Tournament for the past six consecutive years.

===Cross country===
The UNM women&#x27;s cross-country team won the NCAA championship in 2015 and 2017. Lobo Ednah Kurgat also won the individual title in 2017, and UNM&#x27;s Weini Kelati won in 2019.

===Football===
The Lobo football team plays at University Stadium which is located across the street from The Pit.

The team has been to six bowl games since 1997 after a 35-year bowl drought. Placekicker Katie Hnida made history in the 2003 Las Vegas Bowl when she became the first woman to play in an NCAA Division I-A game, attempting but missing an extra point in the Lobos&#x27;s 27–13 loss to UCLA. She later attempted and made two extra points in UNM&#x27;s 72–8 victory over Texas State.

New Mexico also lost its 2003 and 2004 bowl games, making its record in bowl games 2–8–1. The football team went to the first year of the New Mexico Bowl in 2006 and lost to San Jose State University 20–12. In 2007, the Lobos finished the regular season 8–4 and were invited to the New Mexico Bowl for the second straight season. The Lobos shut out the favored Nevada Wolf Pack 23–0 to win their first bowl game since the 1961 Aviation Bowl.

==Student life==
The main university campus is located in the lower Heights of Albuquerque just east of Downtown Albuquerque and is the focal point for the neighborhoods surrounding it; the neighborhoods to the immediate south and west are home to a large population of students. However, the vast majority of UNM&#x27;s student population live off-campus around the Albuquerque metropolitan area, with only just over 2,000 living in on-campus housing.

The Student Union Building (SUB) is a major activity center for students on-campus, with a food court, a movie theater, event facilities, student government and organization offices, student services, and recreation areas. Another major hotspot for students is the popular Frontier Restaurant, a late-night eatery located across Central Avenue from main campus and a popular meeting spot for students. The Duck Pond is a popular relaxation spot for students and local residents, particularly in the warmer months.

===Student organizations===
There are over 400 student-run organizations on campus, which include academic, athletic, ethnic, honorary, political, religious, and service groups, as well as fraternities and sororities.

====Student government====
=====ASUNM=====
The Associated Students of the University of New Mexico (ASUNM) is the undergraduate student government of UNM, with an elected student body president, vice-president, student court, and 20 senators. Senators are elected to two-semester terms. There are two elections each school year; in each, 10 senators are elected. Many candidates run in slates. There are different agencies within ASUNM, such as Lobo Spirit and Community Experience.

=====GPSA=====
The Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA) is the graduate student government of UNM, led by an elected president and a representative council from the different schools of study on campus since 1969.

===Greek life===
The University of New Mexico is home to several fraternities and sororities; on-campus sources claim that around 5% of the UNM student body is involved in Greek life.

===Traditions===
* &quot;Homecoming Week&quot; is held each fall to welcome back alumni. Over the course of the week, the student body elects a Homecoming King and Queen and six attendants (three male and three female) to serve as the homecoming court.
* &quot;Lobo Day&quot; is a celebration for the founding date of the university on February 28, 1889.
* &quot;Red Rally&quot; is a rally held before the football match with UNM&#x27;s rival, New Mexico State University.

===Media===
UNM owns and operates KUNM-FM, one of two National Public Radio stations in Albuquerque. In 2008, KUNM-FM won 16 Associated Press awards, including Station of the Year. UNM also owns and operates the University of New Mexico Press, its publishing arm established in 1929. With Albuquerque Public Schools, UNM also operates New Mexico PBS, Albuquerque&#x27;s public television station which currently broadcasts in High Definition Digital on two channels, English and Spanish. &quot;The Daily Lobo&quot; is UNM&#x27;s student-run daily newspaper and is a publication serving the metro area.

<doc id="404571" wikidata="Q7574072" url="?curid=404571" title="Spatial mismatch">
<text>Spatial mismatch is the mismatch between where low-income households reside and suitable job opportunities. In its original formulation (see below) and in subsequent research, it has mostly been understood as a phenomenon affecting African-Americans, as a result of residential segregation, economic restructuring, and the suburbanization of employment.

Spatial mismatch was first proposed by John F. Kain, following the theory of John Meyer, in a seminal 1968 article, &quot;Housing Segregation, Negro Employment, and Metropolitan Decentralization&quot;. That article did not specifically use the term &quot;spatial mismatch&quot;, and Kain disclaimed credit. 

In 1987, William Julius Wilson was an important exponent, elaborating the role of economic restructuring, as well as the departure of the black middle-class, in the development of a ghetto underclass in the United States.

==History==

After World War I, many wealthy Americans started decentralizing out of the cities and into the suburbs. During the second half of the 20th century, department stores followed the trend of moving into the suburbs. In 1968, Kain formulated the “Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis”, but he did not refer to it by this term. His hypothesis was that black workers reside in segregated zones that are distant and poorly connected to major centers of growth. The phenomenon has many implications for inner-city residents dependent on low-level entry jobs. For example, distance from work centers can lead to increasing unemployment rates and further dampen poverty outcomes for the region at large. Since its conceptualization in the late 1960s, the spatial mismatch hypothesis has been widely cited to explain the economic problems encountered by inner-city minorities.

==Factors==
In 2007, Laurent Gobillon, Harris Selod, and Yves Zenou suggested that there are seven different factors that support the spatial mismatch phenomenon. Four factors are attributed to potential workers accessibility and initiatives. The remaining three factors stress employers&#x27; reluctance to divert away from the negative stigma of city people and in particular minorities when hiring.
===Potential workers perspectives===

*Commuting cost is seen as an obstacle for inner-city people to be present for job interviews and furthermore to arrive to work everyday on time. In other words, cars may be too expensive for some workers and they may have to rely heavily on public transportation. Public transportation is problematic in a sense that it is not always prompt and may not stop at all job location sites.
*Information access to jobs decreases as distance increases away from the job center. People who are living away from the job center are generally less knowledgeable about potential openings than individuals who live closer to the job center. Therefore, networking and information spillovers are of a major advantage in accessing information about potential openings.
*There seems to be a lack of incentive for distance workers to search intensively for a job that is relatively far away. Gobillion, Selod and Zenou believe that minorities, more or less, do a tradeoff between short-term loss and long-term benefits. The short term loss involves making frequent search trips to distant work centers. However, the long-term benefit involves obtaining a stable job and thus a higher wage rate. Unfortunately, minorities tend to weigh the short-term loss higher than the long-term benefits and as a result, decrease their opportunity at obtaining a job in the suburbs.
*There also seems to be a high search cost involve for urban workers looking for a job in the suburbs. It might be associated with paying a job agency to expand their search beyond the urban residential area or locating an agency in the suburbs.

==China==
Growth of ghost cities in China, mostly from not yet agglomerated areas between or adjacent metropolitan areas or coal mining towns, as in the case of the most famous example, Kangbashi New Area of Ordos, are an example of spatial mismatch. In the case of places near metropolitan areas, it represents less of a risk going forward than in mining areas.

<text>Islam is a minority religion in Canada, practised by approximately 4.9% of the population. Canadian Muslims are one of the most ethnically diverse religious groups across the country. Muslims have lived in Canada since 1871 and the first mosque was established in 1938. Most Canadian Muslims are Sunni, while a significant minority are Shia and Ahmadiyya. 

There are a number of Islamic organizations and seminaries (&quot;madrasas&quot;). Opinion polls show most Muslims feel &quot;very proud&quot; to be Canadians, and majority are religious and attend mosque at least once a week. More than half of Canadian Muslims live in Ontario, with significant populations also living in Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia.

The percentage of Muslims in Canada is 4.9% as of the 2021 census. In the Greater Toronto Area, 10% of the population is Muslim, and in Greater Montreal, 8.7% of the population is Muslim.

==History==
Four years after Canada&#x27;s founding in 1867, the 1871 Canadian Census found 13 European Muslims among the population. The first Muslim organization in Canada was registered by immigrants from greater Syria living in Regina, Saskatchewan in 1934. The first Canadian mosque was constructed in Edmonton in 1938 when there were approximately 700 European Muslims in the country. The building is now part of the museum at Fort Edmonton Park. The years after World War II saw a small increase in the Muslim population. However, Muslims were still a distinct minority. It was only after the removal of European immigration preferences in the late 1960s and early 1970s that Muslims began to arrive in significant numbers.

Bosniaks and Albanian Muslims were the founders of Jami Mosque, the first mosque in Toronto in 1968, whose readjustment into masjid (originally an old Catholic school building) occurred on June 23, 1973. The mosque was readjusted for the Bosniaks, with the support of the local Christians. Later, with the action of University of Toronto professor Qadeer Baig, it was purchased by Asian Muslims, while Albanians and Bosniaks later founded the Albanian Muslim Society and &quot;Bosanska džamija&quot; (Bosnian Mosque) respectively. The oldest mosque in Toronto, with the oldest minaret in Ontario built in Osmanic style is in Etobicoke, part of the Bosnian Islamic Centre.

The first Madrasa (Islamic seminary) in North America, Al-Rashid Islamic Institute was established in Cornwall, Ontario in 1983 to teach Hafiz and Ulama and focuses on the traditional Hanafi school of thought. The Seminary was established by Mazhar Alam, originally from Bihar, India, under the direction of his teacher the leading Indian Tablighi scholar Muhammad Zakariya Kandhlawi. Due to its proximity to the US border city of Massena the school has historically had a high percentage of American students. Their most prominent graduate, Muhammad Alshareef completed his Hifz in the early 1990s then went on to form the AlMaghrib Institute.
As with immigrants in general, Muslim immigrants have come to Canada for a variety of reasons. These include higher education, security, employment, and family reunification. Others have come for religious and political freedom, and safety and security, leaving behind civil wars, persecution, and other forms of civil and ethnic strife. In the 1980s, Canada became an important place of refuge for those fleeing the Lebanese Civil War. The 1990s saw Somali Muslims arrive in the wake of the Somali Civil War as well as Bosniaks fleeing the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. However Canada has yet to receive any significant numbers of Iraqis fleeing the Iraqi War. But in general almost every Muslim country in the world has sent immigrants to Canada – from Pakistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania to Yemen and Bangladesh.

According to the Canadian Census of 1971 there were 33,000 Muslims in Canada. In the 1970s large-scale non-European immigration to Canada began. This was reflected in the growth of the Muslim community in Canada. In 1981, the Census listed 98,000 Muslims. The 1991 Census indicated 253,265 Muslims. 

By 2001, the Islamic community in Canada had grown to more than 579,000. In the same year, the fertility rate for Muslims in Canada was higher than the rate for other Canadians (an average of 2.4 children per woman for Muslims in 2001, compared with 1.6 children per woman for other populations in Canada).

Population estimates for the Census 2006 pointed to a figure of 800,000. As of May 2013, Muslims account for 3.2% of the total population, with a total of over a million. In January 2017, six Muslims were killed in a shooting attack at a Quebec city mosque.

In the contemporary era, there are halal restaurants across Canada, including over 1000 in the Greater Toronto Area.

One of the first Islamic internet radio stations, Canadian Islamic Broadcasting Network, was started in 2019.

== Demography ==

=== National and ethnic origins ===
According to the 2011 National Household Survey, there were 424,925 Muslims living in the Greater Toronto Area equalling 7.7% of the total metropolitan population, of which the Muslim community consists of persons of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian, Iranian, African, Arab, Turkish, Bosniak, Albanian, Caucasian, Southeast Asian, and Latin descent. Greater Montreal&#x27;s Muslim community was 221,040 in 2011 or nearly 6% of the total metropolitan population which includes a highly diverse Muslim population from Western/Southern Europe, Caribbean, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Canada&#x27;s national capital Ottawa hosts many Lebanese, Turkish, Bosniak, Albanian, South Asian and Somali Muslims, where the Muslim community numbered approximately 65,880 or 5.5% in 2011. In addition to Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, nearly every major Canadian metropolitan area has a Muslim community, including Vancouver (73,215), where more than a third are of Iranian descent, Calgary (58,310), Edmonton (46,125), Windsor (15,575), Winnipeg (11,265), and Halifax (7,540). In recent years, there has been rapid population growth in Calgary and Edmonton because of the booming economy. 

=== Branches or denominations ===
Major Canadian cities have local Muslim organizations that deal mainly with issues pertaining to their home city, but that support national associations. Most Muslim organizations on the national level are umbrella groups and coordination bodies. Student-led initiatives are generally well supported and successful, including annual events such as MuslimFest and the Reviving the Islamic Spirit conference, the largest Islamic event in Canada.

==== Sunni Muslims ====
The majority of Canadian Muslims follow Sunni Islam.

==== Shia Muslims ====
==== Ahmadiyya Muslims ====
The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has about 50 Local Chapters scattered across Canada, mainly in southern Ontario. The community have 25 places of worship in Canada.

As the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees freedom of religious expression, Canadian Muslims face no official religious discrimination but have been victims of many hate crimes which have been increasingly going up. Learn more about Islamophobia in Canada.

Under Section 2(a) of the Charter, the wearing of a &quot;hijab&quot; is permitted in schools and places of work, although Quebec has ruled that medical faculties are not required to accommodate Muslim women who wish to be served by female employees. Religious holidays and dietary restrictions are also respected, but outside major urban areas it may be difficult to find halal food. It is also often difficult to observe Islamic rules against usury. Some Muslims in some parts of Canada have asked to have family dispute courts to oversee small family cases but were faced with rigorous opposition from both within the Muslim community (both conservative and liberal), and by non-Muslim groups.

In 2011, the Harper government attempted to ban the niqab during citizenship ceremonies. In 2015, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled against the ban, and the Supreme Court turned down the government&#x27;s appeal.

==Mosques and Islamic Centers==
As of 2024, there are at least 458 mosques and Islamic centers across Canada. Most of the mosques are located either in large metropolitan cities, suburbs, or some small cities.

# Islamic Relief Canada helps Canadian Muslims channel charitable contributions to not only Canadians but people in need across the globe. Their platform helps strengthen the relationship between donors and beneficiaries by providing a high level of transparency. 
# Canadian Council of Muslim Women (CCMW) is an organization dedicated to the empowerment, equality and equity of all Muslim women in Canada. It has chapters all over Canada and has launched several projects through community engagement, public policy, stakeholder engagement and amplified awareness of the social injustices that Muslim women and girls endure in Canada.

==Identity and beliefs==
===Opinion held by Muslims===
In a 2016 Environics poll, 83% of Muslims were &quot;very proud&quot; to be Canadian, compared with 73% of non-Muslim Canadians who said the same thing. Canadian Muslims reported &quot;Canada&#x27;s freedom and democracy&quot; as the greatest source of pride, and &quot;multiculturalism and diversity&quot; as the second greatest. 94% of Canadian Muslims reported a &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;very strong&quot; sense of belonging to Canada. 78% of Canadian Muslims attend mosque at least once a week. 73% of women wear some sort of head-covering in public (58% wear the hijab, 13% wear the chador and 2% wear the niqab). Both pride in being Canadian and having a strong sense of belonging had increased in Canadian Muslims as compared to a 2006 survey. Mosque attendance and wearing a head covering in public had also increased since the 2006 survey.

As per the Environics poll, 36% of the Canadian Muslims agreed with the statement homosexuality should be accepted by society which is lower than the general population (80%). However, the acceptance was higher among Muslims born in Canada (52%) and among young Canadian Muslims (47%). The groups that mostly showed unacceptance of homosexuality were the older age group 45 to 59 (55%) and the lowest income group (56%).

===Opinion on Muslims===
According to the surveys conducted by the Angus Reid Institute (ARI), 24% of the Canadians had a favorable opinion of Islam in 2013 which increased to 34% in the 2016 survey and in Quebec, it increased from 16% in 2013 to 32% in 2016.

A majority (75%) of the Canadians strongly support allowing Muslim women to wear hijab in public. However, the wearing of full face and body covering niqab and burka is strongly opposed. Only three-in-ten Canadians are supportive of it.

===Politics===

The Liberal Party (45%) voters and New Democratic Party voters (42%) have more favourable opinion on Muslims, than compared to Conservative Party voters (24%).

In 2023 the Canadian Muslim donor group known as the Network-100 GTA consisting of 400 working professionals pulled financial support from the Liberal Party, who had received over $20,000 prior since 2014, due to residing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s refusal to call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. The National Council of Canadian Muslims made a statement during the holiday Ramadan in 2024 with the mention of MPs not being welcome in their places of worship until a ceasefire was enacted.

A May 2024 poll showed 41% of Muslims intended to vote for the NDP, 31% for Liberals and 15% for the Conservatives.

==Media==
*&quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot; was a Canadian sitcom on CBC Television created by Zarqa Nawaz.
*Ginella Massa is the first Canadian hijab wearing news anchor for CityNews Toronto.

<text>The NCAA Division II football championship is an American college football tournament played annually to determine a champion at the NCAA Division II level. It was first held in 1973, as a single-elimination playoff with eight teams. The tournament field has subsequently been expanded three times: to 16 teams in 1988, 24 teams in 2004, and 28 teams in 2016.

The national championship game has been held in eight different cities. Former sites include Sacramento, California (1973–1975); Wichita Falls, Texas (1976–1977); Longview, Texas (1978); Albuquerque, New Mexico (1979–1980); McAllen, Texas (1981–1985); Florence, Alabama (1986–2013); and Kansas City, Kansas (2014–2017). From 1973 through 1985 (with the exception of 1978) the championship game carried a bowl designation (see NCAA Division II bowl games).

Since 2018, the championship game has been played at the McKinney ISD Stadium and Community Event Center in McKinney, Texas. Since 1994, the games have been broadcast on ESPN.

==Small-college wire service national champions==
Prior to 1973, for what was then called the NCAA College Division, national champions were selected by polls conducted at the end of each regular season by two major wire services, the Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI). In some years, the two polls named different number one teams. From 1964 to 1972, postseason bowl games crowned four regional champions. NCAA Division II bowl games still exist, but only as postseason contests for teams not qualifying for the championship playoffs.

Polls to rank &quot;small college&quot; football teams were conducted by the Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI) during, and at the end of, each regular season. The AP polled a panel of writers, while UPI polled a panel of coaches. When UPI began its poll in 1958, it explained that the poll would cover college football programs not considered &quot;major&quot; by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), with the small schools (then numbering 519) belonging to the NCAA, the NAIA, both, or neither. The AP began its poll in 1960.

== NCAA Division II champions ==

Since 1973, a post-season tournament has been held to determine the Division II Champion. The current format, in use since 2016, features 28 teams. They are organized into 4 super-regions of 7 teams each, with the top-seeded team in each super-region getting a bye during the first round. Prior to the championship game, all contests are hosted by the higher-seeded team. the semi-final games are held at the home stadiums of the two highest-seeded remaining teams. Since 2018, the championship game has been played at the McKinney Independent School District Stadium, a 12,000 seat facility that opened in August 2018.

<text>Dorian Andrew Mientjez Yates (born 19 April 1962) is an English retired professional bodybuilder. He won the Mr. Olympia title six consecutive times from 1992 to 1997. Known for his high intensity training, top-level conditioning, and his wide, thick back, he is widely considered to be one of the greatest professional bodybuilders in history.

==Early life==
Dorian Andrew Mientjez Yates was born on 19 April 1962, in Solihull, then in Warwickshire, England. He grew up on a farm in Hurley, rural Warwickshire. Yates&#x27;s father died of a heart attack when he was 13. He, his mother and his sister then moved to Walmley in Sutton Coldfield. As a professional bodybuilder, Yates lived in the Ladywood and Castle Vale areas of Birmingham.

When Yates was 18, he and his friends were arrested while crossing Birmingham to get to a party. Each of them received 6 months at Whatton Youth Detention Centre, where Yates would take up weight training.

==Career==
Yates started working out in 1983 at Martin&#x27;s Gym in Temple Row, Birmingham. During this time he won the 1984 Mr. Birmingham as a novice and in 1986 became the British Champion at Heavyweight for the first time. 
His professional record consists of 15 major contest wins and two second-place finishes; from 1992 to his retirement in 1997 he won every single contest he entered. His career ended in large part due to chronic acute injuries, including torn biceps and triceps, the latter just three weeks prior to his final contest, the 1997 Mr. Olympia, which he won in spite of the injury; his win generated controversy among fellow athletes, critics, and amateurs, who thought the runner-up Nasser El Sonbaty deserved to win. He is one of only four men to retire as Mr. Olympia.

Yates was a proponent of Arthur Jones and Mike Mentzer&#x27;s high-intensity training (HIT) style of bodybuilding, which posits that maximum muscle stimulation can be reached through short and intense workout sessions instead of long and slow ones. He said, “If you feel you can attempt a second set, then you couldn’t have been pulling out all the stops during the first set.” Examples of his biggest lifts include 435-pound underhand barbell rows for 6-8 reps, 425-incline presses for 6-10 reps, and 595-pound barbell shrugs for 10-12 reps. He earned the nickname &quot;The Shadow&quot; coined by Peter McGough for his tendency to unexpectedly appear at major bodybuilding contests and steal the win, having neither confirmed nor denied whether he would compete beforehand, and for spending most of his time between contests avoiding the public eye. 

Yates is considered to be the first of the &quot;mass monsters&quot; in bodybuilding. He combined his enormous muscle mass along with peak conditioning, quoted as being &quot;granite hardness&quot;. He believes that his injuries are due to his habit of maintaining an extreme level of training intensity all year long, even when approaching contests, while being on a severely restricted &quot;cutting&quot; diet which weakens the body overall. Regarding the use of PEDs, he referenced the documentary &quot;Super Size Me&quot; and stated that eating three McDonald&#x27;s meals a day is more harmful for the metabolism than his 12 years of regular steroid use.

==Post-competition career==
In 1987, Yates purchased Temple Gym, located on Temple Street in Birmingham. In 2006, he franchised four additional Temple Gym locations, three of which are in the UK. As of 2020, only the original Birmingham gym is still in operation. The Birmingham gym has now relocated from Temple Street to the city&#x27;s jewellery quarter.

Yates formed the California-based company Heavy Duty Inc. in 1994 with Mike Mentzer and Ray Mentzer. The company marketed athletic apparel and bodybuilding-related books.

In 1998, Yates partnered with Kerry Kayes to form the bodybuilding supplement company CNP Professional, which marketed a Dorian Yates Approved product line in the U.S. He left the company in 2006 to form his own company, Dorian Yates Ultimate Formulas, which offers a line of protein and weight-gain supplements. He started a second company in 2010, EU Peptides, which sells peptide hormones and other pro-hormone supplements. He left EU Peptides in 2012. In 2011, Yates founded a third company, DY Nutrition, which specializes in pre-workout formulas and has released several training DVDs.

DY Nutrition is a line of supplements that consists of whey protein supplements, pre-workout, and post-workout supplements owned and endorsed by Yates.

==Personal life==
Yates now lives in Spain. He is married to Brazilian fitness model Glauce &quot;Gal&quot; Ferreira, who won the IFBB South American Bodyfitness event and was the 2007 IFBB World Bodyfitness Champion. They met at the 2008 Arnold Classic and live in Marbella. Yates&#x27;s son from his ex-wife Deb is a bodybuilder and works closely with his father.

Yates has described yoga and meditation as life-altering experiences and practices yoga on a daily basis. He has endorsed the use of some psychedelic entheogens, including ayahuasca, for religious and spiritual purposes. He is open about his use of cannabis, which predates his bodybuilding career; he has been an advocate for cannabis legalisation since the late 2000s due to its relaxing properties, temporary increases in respiratory capacity, and claimed anti-cancer properties.

<text>In mathematical logic, propositional logic and predicate logic, a well-formed formula, abbreviated WFF or wff, often simply formula, is a finite sequence of symbols from a given alphabet that is part of a formal language.

The abbreviation wff is pronounced &quot;woof&quot;, or sometimes &quot;wiff&quot;, &quot;weff&quot;, or &quot;whiff&quot;. 

A formal language can be identified with the set of formulas in the language. A formula is a syntactic object that can be given a semantic meaning by means of an interpretation. Two key uses of formulas are in propositional logic and predicate logic.

==Introduction==
A key use of formulas is in propositional logic and predicate logic such as first-order logic. In those contexts, a formula is a string of symbols φ for which it makes sense to ask &quot;is φ true?&quot;, once any free variables in φ have been instantiated. In formal logic, proofs can be represented by sequences of formulas with certain properties, and the final formula in the sequence is what is proven.

Although the term &quot;formula&quot; may be used for written marks (for instance, on a piece of paper or chalkboard), it is more precisely understood as the sequence of symbols being expressed, with the marks being a token instance of formula. This distinction between the vague notion of &quot;property&quot; and the inductively-defined notion of well-formed formula has roots in Weyl&#x27;s 1910 paper &quot;Uber die Definitionen der mathematischen Grundbegriffe&quot;. Thus the same formula may be written more than once, and a formula might in principle be so long that it cannot be written at all within the physical universe.

Formulas themselves are syntactic objects. They are given meanings by interpretations. For example, in a propositional formula, each propositional variable may be interpreted as a concrete proposition, so that the overall formula expresses a relationship between these propositions. A formula need not be interpreted, however, to be considered solely as a formula.

==Propositional calculus==

The formulas of propositional calculus, also called propositional formulas, are expressions such as formula_1. Their definition begins with the arbitrary choice of a set &quot;V&quot; of propositional variables. The alphabet consists of the letters in &quot;V&quot; along with the symbols for the propositional connectives and parentheses &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;, all of which are assumed to not be in &quot;V&quot;. The formulas will be certain expressions (that is, strings of symbols) over this alphabet.

The formulas are inductively defined as follows:
* Each propositional variable is, on its own, a formula.
* If φ is a formula, then ¬φ is a formula.
* If φ and ψ are formulas, and • is any binary connective, then ( φ • ψ) is a formula. Here • could be (but is not limited to) the usual operators ∨, ∧, →, or ↔.

This definition can also be written as a formal grammar in Backus–Naur form, provided the set of variables is finite:

Using this grammar, the sequence of symbols
:(((&quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot;) ∧ (&quot;r&quot; → &quot;s&quot;)) ∨ (¬&quot;q&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;s&quot;))
is a formula, because it is grammatically correct. The sequence of symbols
:((&quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot;)→(&quot;qq&quot;))&quot;p&quot;))
is not a formula, because it does not conform to the grammar.

A complex formula may be difficult to read, owing to, for example, the proliferation of parentheses. To alleviate this last phenomenon, precedence rules (akin to the standard mathematical order of operations) are assumed among the operators, making some operators more binding than others. For example, assuming the precedence (from most binding to least binding) 1. ¬   2. →  3. ∧  4. ∨. Then the formula
:(((&quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot;) ∧ (&quot;r&quot; → &quot;s&quot;)) ∨ (¬&quot;q&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;s&quot;))
may be abbreviated as
:&quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot; ∧ &quot;r&quot; → &quot;s&quot; ∨ ¬&quot;q&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;s&quot;
This is, however, only a convention used to simplify the written representation of a formula. If the precedence was assumed, for example, to be left-right associative, in following order: 1. ¬   2. ∧  3. ∨  4. →, then the same formula above (without parentheses) would be rewritten as
:(&quot;p&quot; → (&quot;q&quot; ∧ &quot;r&quot;)) → (&quot;s&quot; ∨ (¬&quot;q&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;s&quot;))

==Predicate logic==
The definition of a formula in first-order logic formula_2 is relative to the signature of the theory at hand. This signature specifies the constant symbols, predicate symbols, and function symbols of the theory at hand, along with the arities of the function and predicate symbols.

The definition of a formula comes in several parts. First, the set of terms is defined recursively. Terms, informally, are expressions that represent objects from the domain of discourse.
#Any variable is a term.
#Any constant symbol from the signature is a term
#an expression of the form &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;), where &quot;f&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-ary function symbol, and &quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot; are terms, is again a term.

The next step is to define the atomic formulas.
#If &quot;t&quot;1 and &quot;t&quot;2 are terms then &quot;t&quot;1=&quot;t&quot;2 is an atomic formula
#If &quot;R&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-ary predicate symbol, and &quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot; are terms, then &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;1...,&quot;t&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is an atomic formula

Finally, the set of formulas is defined to be the smallest set containing the set of atomic formulas such that the following holds:
#formula_3 is a formula when formula_4 is a formula
#formula_5 and formula_6 are formulas when formula_4 and formula_8 are formulas;
#formula_9 is a formula when formula_10 is a variable and formula_4 is a formula;
#formula_12 is a formula when formula_10 is a variable and formula_4 is a formula (alternatively, formula_12 could be defined as an abbreviation for formula_16).

If a formula has no occurrences of formula_17 or formula_18, for any variable formula_10, then it is called quantifier-free. An &quot;existential formula&quot; is a formula starting with a sequence of existential quantification followed by a quantifier-free formula.

==Atomic and open formulas==
An &quot;atomic formula&quot; is a formula that contains no logical connectives nor quantifiers, or equivalently a formula that has no strict subformulas.
The precise form of atomic formulas depends on the formal system under consideration; for propositional logic, for example, the atomic formulas are the propositional variables. For predicate logic, the atoms are predicate symbols together with their arguments, each argument being a term.

According to some terminology, an &quot;open formula&quot; is formed by combining atomic formulas using only logical connectives, to the exclusion of quantifiers. This is not to be confused with a formula which is not closed.

==Closed formulas==
A &quot;closed formula&quot;, also &quot;ground formula&quot; or &quot;sentence&quot;, is a formula in which there are no free occurrences of any variable. If A is a formula of a first-order language in which the variables have free occurrences, then A preceded by is a &quot;universal closure&quot; of A.

==Properties applicable to formulas==

* A formula A in a language formula_20 is &quot;valid&quot; if it is true for every interpretation of formula_20.
* A formula A in a language formula_20 is &quot;satisfiable&quot; if it is true for some interpretation of formula_20.
* A formula A of the language of arithmetic is &quot;decidable&quot; if it represents a decidable set, i.e. if there is an effective method which, given a substitution of the free variables of A, says that either the resulting instance of A is provable or its negation is.

==Usage of the terminology==
In earlier works on mathematical logic (e.g. by Church), formulas referred to any strings of symbols and among these strings, well-formed formulas were the strings that followed the formation rules of (correct) formulas.

Several authors simply say formula. Modern usages (especially in the context of computer science with mathematical software such as model checkers, automated theorem provers, interactive theorem provers) tend to retain of the notion of formula only the algebraic concept and to leave the question of well-formedness, i.e. of the concrete string representation of formulas (using this or that symbol for connectives and quantifiers, using this or that parenthesizing convention, using Polish or infix notation, etc.) as a mere notational problem.

The expression &quot;well-formed formulas&quot; (WFF) also crept into popular culture. &quot;WFF&quot; is part of an esoteric pun used in the name of the academic game &quot;WFF &#x27;N PROOF: The Game of Modern Logic&quot;, by Layman Allen, developed while he was at Yale Law School (he was later a professor at the University of Michigan). The suite of games is designed to teach the principles of symbolic logic to children (in Polish notation). Its name is an echo of &quot;whiffenpoof&quot;, a nonsense word used as a cheer at Yale University made popular in &quot;The Whiffenpoof Song&quot; and The Whiffenpoofs.

<text>Possible Peru () was a Peruvian political party. It was founded in 1994 by Alejandro Toledo with the original name of Possible Country ().

== History ==
Possible Peru has its roots in an earlier political party, Possible Country, which was founded by the economist Alejandro Toledo in 1994. País Possible garnered 3% of the popular vote in the 1995 presidential election.

In the 2000 presidential election, Toledo ran as a candidate from Possible Peru. After coming in second to Alberto Fujimori in the initial round of voting, Toledo withdrew as a candidate and requested that his supporters cast blank ballots in the second round run-off that was to be held because both candidates failed to receive more than 50% of the vote and Fujimori was subsequently re-elected in the run-off.

After Fujimori was sworn in for his third term, Toledo led his supporters in organizing a protest against Fujimori&#x27;s alleged corruption, which became popularly known as &quot;Four Suyos March&quot;, in a reference to the four &quot;suyu&quot; (district) in which the Inca Empire or Tawantin Suyu was divided. The protest turned violent, with six people being killed on 28 July inside a bank on fire. In response to growing allegations of corruption within his administration, Fujimori resigned as president in November 2000.

At the legislative elections held on 8 April 2001, the party won 26.3% of the popular vote and 45 out of 120 seats in the Congress of the Republic. Its presidential candidate at the elections of the same day, Alejandro Toledo, won 36.5% of the vote and went on to win the second round on 3 June 2001 with 53.1%.

Toledo was elected in 2001 as Fujimori&#x27;s replacement, receiving 53.1% of the popular vote. Shortly after becoming president, Toledo made a strategic alliance with the Independent Moralizing Front, led by Fernando Olivera.

In 2004, Toledo was accused of falsifying some of the signatures that had been collected on his behalf in the 2000 election. Police concluded that 78% of the signatures had been falsified. Further investigation revealed that the forged signatures had been produced by Toledo&#x27;s sister, who was subsequently placed under house arrest.

At the legislative elections held on 9 April 2006, the party won 4% of the popular vote and 2 out of 120 seats in Congress.

According to Daniel Mora, one of the causes that led Possible Peru to the debacle was the arrogance of Alejandro Toledo. Later, Possible Peru supported the candidacy of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, despite the fact that Possible Peru lost the registration by failing to pass the electoral threshold. On 12 May 2016, Carmen Omonte was withdrawn from the Lavajato Commission by her own ex-party Possible Peru. At the same time, Judge Abel Concha decided to lift Alejandro Toledo&#x27;s bank secrecy, this being part of the Ecoteva case trial. On 12 March 2017, Marcial Ayaipoma announced that Possible Peru will be liquidated by not passing the electoral fence, as mandated by the Law of Political Parties.

Possible Peru was dissolved in 2017 following its poor results at the 2016 general election, garnering 1.2% at national level. Toledo unsuccessfully attempted to refound the party under the name of Peruvian Chakana ().

==2006 elections ==
Possible Peru&#x27;s presidential candidate for the 2006 election, , along with the vice-presidential candidates, pulled out of the race on 31 January. However, a clash with the core of the party over the inclusion of some people in the congressional candidate list led to the withdrawal of his candidature.

The previous candidate, businesswoman also renounced her candidature one week after being selected following growing pressure from within certain parts of the Possible Peru party, due to her political inexperience.

Belaúnde Aubry was until recently leader of another party, Popular Action, which was founded by his father and former president, Fernando Belaúnde Terry, and was invited by Possible Peru to represent the party in the elections.

<text>National Unity (, UN) was a Peruvian center-right, mainly a Christian democratic electoral alliance.

== History ==
National Unity was founded in 2000 by Lourdes Flores Nano and was considered Peru&#x27;s third largest party. The party participated in the 2001 general election, on 8 April 2001, where its presidential candidate, Lourdes Flores Nano, won 24.3% of the popular vote and failed to qualify in the June run-off, placing third. At the legislative elections held on the same day, the party won 13.8% of the popular vote and 17 out of 120 seats in the Congress of the Republic.

The Party itself was a loose alliance of the constituent political parties. Its members were initially the Christian People&#x27;s Party (PPC) &quot;(Partido Popular Cristiano&quot;), National Solidarity (SN) (&quot;Solidaridad Nacional&quot;), National Renewal (RN) (&quot;Renovación Nacional&quot;) and Radical Change (RC) (&quot;Cambio Radical&quot;), but the latter two left the coalition, following the 2006 general election and during the campaign, respectively. PPC and SN renewed their alliance until 2008.

National Solidarity&#x27;s leader Luis Castañeda Lossio ran for mayor of Lima in 2002 under National Unity&#x27;s banner, defeating the incumbent Alberto Andrade, from Somos Perú and a former Christian People&#x27;s Party member himself.

The party participated in the 2006 general election on 9 April, and was again headed by Lourdes Flores Nano. Flores placed third in the presidential vote with 23.8% of the vote, behind Ollanta Humala of the Union for Peru and Alan García of the Peruvian Aprista Party, and failed to qualify for the run-off in the June 2006 run-off vote. At the legislative elections held on 9 April 2006, the party won 15.3% of the popular vote and 17 out of 120 seats in Congress.

== Last years and dissolution ==
In 2008, both PPC and SN decided to end the coalition. In the 2011 general election, SN (led by Luis Castañeda Lossio) decided to run for presidency under their own alliance; whilst PPC decided to integrate a new coalition called Alliance for the Great Change, led by Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, which participated in the elections as well.

<doc id="404589" wikidata="Q6952917" url="?curid=404589" title="NCAA Division III football championship">
<text>The NCAA Division III football championship is an American college football tournament played annually to determine a champion at the NCAA Division III level. It was first held in 1973, as a single-elimination playoff with eight teams. Over the past 50 seasons, the number of participants has grown to 40 In 2024, 28 playoff bids went to conference champions via automatic qualification, leaving 12 places for at-large selections.

The Division III championship game, known as the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl or Stagg Bowl (named after football coach Amos Alonzo Stagg), was held at Salem Football Stadium in Salem, Virginia in 2023, where it was previously held annually from 1993 to 2017. Other Stagg Bowl sites have included Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland (2022), Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio (2021), Woodforest Bank Stadium in Shenandoah, Texas (2018–2019), Hawkins Stadium in Bradenton, Florida (1990–1992), Garrett-Harrison Stadium in Phenix City, Alabama (1973–1982, 1985–1989), and Galbreath Field at the College Football Hall of Fame, when the Hall was located in Kings Island, Ohio (1983–1984).

==West and East Region Championships (1969–1972)==
The Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl was founded by the NCAA in October 1969. Along with its counterpart, the Knute Rockne Bowl, it was &quot;created by the NCAA ... for its College Division II schools, those 100-plus smallest schools in the NCAA.&quot; Eligible schools were divided into an East Region (the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states) and West Region (the rest of the country), with the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl serving as the championship of the West Region, and the Knute Rockne Bowl as the championship of the East Region.

The NCAA thus provided postseason opportunities for College Division teams too small to compete for spots in the four regional bowls it had established in 1964 (as of 1969, these were the Camellia Bowl for the West, the Pecan Bowl for the Midwest, the Grantland Rice Bowl for the Mideast, and the Boardwalk Bowl for the East). At least for the sport of football, this accommodation in 1969 foreshadowed the decision to subdivide the College Division four years later, into Division II and Division III.

===Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl (West Region championship)===
===Knute Rockne Bowl (East Region championship)===
==National Championships (1973–present)==
When the College Division was subdivided into the current Division II and Division III in 1973, the NCAA made the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl the Division III national championship game. Initially, Phenix City, Alabama (site of the 1971 and 1972 Stagg Bowls) continued as the host city.

<doc id="404590" wikidata="Q15075" url="?curid=404590" title="Marlboro">
<text>Marlboro (, ) is an American brand of cigarettes owned and manufactured by Philip Morris USA (a branch of Altria) within the United States and by Philip Morris International (PMI, now separate from Altria) in most global territories outside the US. The brand was introduced in 1924, initially marketed towards women before it evolved towards men during the 1950s. Marlboro would eventually become one of the world&#x27;s most valuable brands and best-selling products, and it was widely known for its advertizing featuring the Marlboro Man, a fictional cowboy.

Today, Marlboro continues to be one of the largest brand products of cigarettes. Marlboro&#x27;s largest cigarette manufacturing plant is located in Richmond, Virginia. In Canada, a separate product using the Marlboro brand is owned and manufactured by Imperial Tobacco Canada, while the international product is distributed in Canada by a unit of PMI under the name &quot;Rooftop&quot;. Also in India, a separate Marlboro product is made and marketed by Godfrey Phillips India.

==History==

In 1847, the family of British tobacconist Philip Morris opened a shop on Bond Street, London, selling tobacco and rolled cigarettes. After Philip&#x27;s death in 1873, his brother Leopold and widow Margaret continued the business, growing it and opening a factory on Great Marlborough Street, London, from which the name was taken. 

A New York subsidiary was opened in 1902 to sell many of its cigarette brands. The name &#x27;&quot;Marlboro&quot;&#x27; was registered in the US in 1908 although no cigarette was marketed under this name until 1923. In 1924, the brand was launched. They were first marketed as &quot;America&#x27;s luxury cigarette&quot; and were mainly sold in hotels and resorts.

Around the 1930s, it was starting to be advertised as a women&#x27;s cigarette, based on the slogan &quot;Mild As May&quot;.
However, as early as 1885, a brand called &quot;Marlborough&quot; was already being marketed as a &quot;ladies&#x27; favorite&quot; by Philip Morris &amp; Co.

Shortly before World War II, the brand&#x27;s sales stagnated at less than 1% of tobacco sales in the US and was briefly withdrawn from the market. After the war, Camel, Lucky Strike and Chesterfield were the only common cigarettes.

After scientists published a major study linking smoking to lung cancer in the 1950s, Philip Morris repositioned Marlboro as a men&#x27;s cigarette in order to fit a market niche of men who were concerned about lung cancer while also concerned with masculinity if they smoked a filtered cigarette usually marketed to women. The Leo Burnett advertising agency solved the problem by a new style of advertising that dispensed with copy and created a visual personality for the brand. Marlboro ads now featured masculinity. The Marlboro Man was a sea captain, gunsmith, athlete and cowboy. 

Part of Marlboro&#x27;s rise in market share was its ability to produce &quot;milder, more aromatic, sweeter, and less harsh&quot; cigarettes by adding ammonia to the tobacco. Further usage of diammonium phosphate allowed Marlboro to free base the nicotine in tobacco, allowing for more efficient delivery. Marlboro kept this process secret for many years, as freebasing is the same process used to produce crack cocaine from normal cocaine. Some experts have called the product that Marlboro sold &quot;crack tobacco.&quot;

The first Marlboro cigarettes manufactured outside of the United States were produced in Switzerland in 1957 when Philip Morris International signed an agreement with Neuchâtel-based Fabriques de Tabac Réunies, before acquiring them 6 years later.

In the late 1960s, Marlboro &quot;Longhorn 100&#x27;s&quot; were introduced. Although color-coded with gold, they were full flavor cigarettes, not lights. In 1972, Marlboro became the best-selling brand of tobacco in the world.

In order to comply with a 2006 court ruling in &quot;United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al.&quot;, Philip Morris (and all other cigarette companies) are now prevented from using words such as &quot;Lights&quot;, &quot;Ultra-Lights&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Mild&quot;, or any similar designation that may yield an impression of being safer than regular full flavored cigarettes. Thus Marlboro and other cigarette companies use only color-coding instead; for example, Marlboro Lights are now called Marlboro Gold Pack.

Philip Morris responded to the popularity of Pall Mall, the number three brand, by pushing Marlboro Special Blends, a lower-priced cigarette.

In 2013, Philip Morris International introduced &quot;Marlboro 2.0&quot;. The pack design was changed; the dark red was replaced with a lighter red, the &quot;Marlboro&quot; and Philip Morris logo became ribbed and transparent, and around 2017 a special &quot;Smart SEAL&quot; was introduced to keep the stored cigarettes fresh for a longer period of time. The Marlboro 2.0 packs are mainly available in Europe and some parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, but not in the US, Canada and Australia (due to plain packaging) and New Zealand.

In 2015, Philip Morris announced they would introduce a &quot;Firm Filter&quot; to their Marlboro Red, Gold, Silver Blue, Ice Blast and White Menthol variants. Philip Morris managing director for the UK and Ireland, Martin Inkster, said that the Firm Filter technique was added to &quot;offer quality you can feel and it is a cleaner way to stub out your cigarette&quot;.

In January 2023 the US Food Drug Administration approved of marketing around the U.S. for multiple Marlboro Vape Heatsticks, Sienna Heatstick, Amber Heatstick &amp; Bronze Heatstick.

==Advertising==
In the 1920s, advertising for the cigarette was primarily based on how ladylike the filter cigarette was, in an attempt to appeal to the mass market. To this end, the filter had a printed red band around it to hide lipstick stains, calling it &quot;Beauty Tips to Keep the Paper from Your Lips&quot;.

The red and white package was designed by designer Frank Gianninoto. The repositioning of Marlboro as a men&#x27;s cigarette was handled by Chicago advertiser Leo Burnett. The proposed campaign was to present a lineup of manly figures: sea captains, weightlifters, war correspondents, construction workers, etc. The cowboy was to have been the first in this series. While Philip Morris was concerned about the campaign, they eventually gave the green light.

Marlboro&#x27;s market share rose from less than one percent to the fourth best-selling brand. This convinced Philip Morris to drop the lineup of manly figures and stick with the cowboy, later known as the Marlboro Man. From 1963, the television advertisements used Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s theme from &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;.

Over the years, Philip Morris has made many billboard, poster and magazine adverts.

Philip Morris also made various sports-related billboards, stickers and other memorabilia throughout the years, mainly promoting the Marlboro brand via its McLaren and Ferrari teams partnerships in places like Russia and Monaco.

Through licensees, Philip Morris sells various merchandising products, such as lighters, ashtrays, sunglasses and other accessories, which are sometimes given away to the target group as part of marketing promotions. 

In 1983, the campaign &quot;Marlboro Adventure Team&quot; was launched in Germany, in which purchasers of the brand could apply to win a trip to the USA to live like the &quot;Marlboro Man&quot;, as well as a plethora of different clothing items and accessories.

==Sport sponsorship==

According to Ellen Merlo, vice president of marketing services at Philip Morris, quoted in a 1989 Marlboro advertisement:We perceive Formula One and Indy car racing as adding, if you will, a modern-day dimension to the Marlboro Man. The image of Marlboro is very rugged, individualistic, heroic. And so is this style of auto racing. From an image standpoint, the fit is good.

===Formula One===


Marlboro is known for its association with motor racing. This started in the season with the sponsorship of the Formula One team BRM. The first win for a Marlboro-sponsored Formula One car was achieved at the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix by Jean-Pierre Beltoise driving for the BRM team. In and , the cigarette giant backed the Frank Williams Racing Cars team, whose cars were registered as &quot;Iso-Marlboro&quot;.

In the 1974 season, Marlboro became associated with the McLaren team. The team won their first World Constructors&#x27; Championship as well as first World Drivers&#x27; Championship (for Emerson Fittipaldi) in the first season of the partnership between McLaren and Marlboro. The team won another drivers title in for James Hunt. Following that, the partnership went through a dry patch until Ron Dennis&#x27;s Project Four Organization took over the team in . Marlboro-sponsored McLaren triumphed Formula One for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, with Niki Lauda, Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna between them winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship all but one year from to . After the departure of Ayrton Senna at the end of the season, Marlboro McLaren never won a race again. Marlboro ended their sponsorship of the team at the end of the season, which ended the red and white McLaren livery. McLaren was sponsored by West from the start of the season onwards. McLaren and Marlboro had the longest sponsorship deal between a team and its title sponsor in Formula One history, which lasted for 23 consecutive seasons (–).

Over the years, McLaren altered the Marlboro livery to comply with regional anti-tobacco sponsorship laws which were in place in countries like France, the UK and later Germany. The Marlboro logo was replaced by a chevron in , with a barcode in and and from to or with &quot;McLaren&quot; in and from to and to . At the 1986 Portuguese Grand Prix, Keke Rosberg&#x27;s car was painted yellow and white rather than red and white, to advertise Marlboro Lights.

Marlboro also sponsored Scuderia Ferrari&#x27;s drivers since the season (the brand appeared only on helmets and suits) but only in Marlboro became a minor sponsor on Ferrari&#x27;s Formula One cars. Until then, Enzo Ferrari allowed only technical suppliers brands to appear on his team cars. In , Marlboro became the main sponsor (surpassing Goodyear, and making that Ferrari painting the car&#x27;s high air boxes were painted red and white), eventually becoming the title sponsor in when the team was officially renamed as &quot;Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro&quot;. Marlboro remained Ferrari&#x27;s title sponsor until the 2011 European Grand Prix and the main sponsor until the end of the season.

Over the years, Ferrari, just like McLaren, had to alter the Marlboro livery in various ways to comply with regional anti-tobacco sponsoring laws which were in place in countries like France, the UK and later Germany. The Marlboro logo was removed completely or replaced with a white space from to (The Ferrari cars had white spaces over Marlboro occasionally in and ), changed to a &quot;bar code&quot; from to 1999 and in and , or the text was removed while keeping the chevron with the driver&#x27;s name () and in the team member clothing, the Marlboro logo became a white square with a red stripe above with the driver&#x27;s written name from the 1980s until . The team used a special livery for the 2001 Italian Grand Prix in remembrance of the September 11 attacks in the US; both cars ran without any sponsorship livery and sported matte black nose-cones. In the 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix the cars sported black nosecones as a sign of mourning for Pope John Paul II.

In September 2005, Ferrari signed an extension of their sponsorship arrangement with Marlboro until 2011. This agreement came at a time when tobacco sponsorship had become wholly banned in the European Union and other F1 teams ended their relationships with tobacco companies. In reporting the deal, &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine judged it to be a &quot;black day&quot; for the sport, putting non-tobacco funded teams at a disadvantage and discouraging other brands from entering a sport still associated with tobacco. The magazine estimated that in the period between 2005 and 2011, Ferrari received $1 billion from the agreement. Depending on the venue of races and the particular national laws, the Marlboro branding became largely subliminal in most countries.

In mid-2006, special &quot;racing editions&quot; of Marlboro Red were sold in the UK, with a Ferrari-inspired design, although the Ferrari name and badge were not used. In April 2008, Marlboro displayed explicit on-car branding on Ferrari for the last time, then permanently replaced with a variety of barcodes in place of it. Since then, there were calls from leading health officials, the European Commissioner for Health and influential doctors for a review of the subliminal advertising contract Marlboro has with Advertising Guerrilla and Ferrari, due to the implications of influencing the purchase of cigarettes with possible subliminal advertising, as no tobacco products can be promoted in sporting events in Europe. The Ferrari team claimed the barcode was part of the car design, not an advertising message.

The controversial barcode design was removed by Ferrari for the start of the Spanish Grand Prix in the 2010 season, but the barcode remained on drivers&#x27; team gear. In January 2011, the Scuderia Ferrari presented a new logo for its racing team. This logo is considered by an F1-website as an advertisement for Marlboro, evocating the top-left corner design of a Marlboro cigarettes pack.

In June 2011, Ferrari extended its partnership with Marlboro through to the end of 2015, despite cigarette advertising being banned in the sport. The deal has been subsequently renewed for three more years, through 2018. In February 2018, Philip Morris renewed their partnership deal with Ferrari until the end of 2021. While the logo, which has been in place since 2011, has been removed on this year&#x27;s car. Before 2018 Japanese Grand Prix, Ferrari launches their revised SF71H livery featuring PMI&#x27;s Mission Winnow brand.

Marlboro had provided financial support to many racing drivers, the most illustrious of whom are Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Mika Häkkinen. From 1970 until the mid-1990s, the logos of the cigarettes could be present on the combinations of the drivers if they were not present on the cars. Marlboro has also sponsored many grand prix races up until 2005.

Marlboro also sponsored a multitude of other, smaller teams in Formula One. It was the main sponsor of Alfa Romeo F1 Team between and , although unable to match up to its pre-war and 1950s heyday, the team only achieving one pole position, one fastest lap and four podium finishes. In the Italian clothing brand Benetton took over Alfa Romeo&#x27;s livery sponsorship, which they held until the withdrawal of Alfa Romeo from Formula One at the end of . The Marlboro logo was replaced with a barcode at certain races, due to tobacco or alcohol sponsorship bans in place.

Marlboro sponsored the BMS Scuderia Italia team from until , when Chesterfield became their main sponsor. The livery was similar to the Ferrari and Alfa Romeo ones. The Marlboro logo was displayed on the front and side of the cars and on the drivers&#x27; helmets. In some races where explicit tobacco sponsoring was forbidden, the Marlboro logo was removed.

===GP2===
From 2005 to 2007, GP2 Series team ART Grand Prix was sponsored by Marlboro. The Marlboro logos were prominently shown on the car in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, but in 2007 the team only sponsored the brand on the rear wing. In countries where the sponsoring of tobacco was forbidden, the Marlboro logos were replaced with a barcode.

===Grand Prix motorcycle racing===

Marlboro entered the Grand Prix motorcycle racing in the seventies as personal sponsor of riders like Giacomo Agostini, Angel Nieto and Jarno Saarinen. In 1976, Marlboro backed Agostini&#x27;s team, who raced MV Agusta bikes with little factory support.

Since 1983, the cigarette brand sponsored the Yamaha 500 cc works team, which was managed by Agostini until 1989 and then by Kenny Roberts until 1996. During that period, the Japanese bikes won six World Championships and, as a result of their sponsorship, Marlboro decals on race replica bikes became one of the most popular decal kits that were available.

In the 1990s, Marlboro&#x27;s livery also appeared on other bikes, especially the Hondas entered by Team Pileri (from 1992 to 1995), Pons Racing (in 1993) and Erv Kanemoto&#x27;s team (in 1997 and 1998) who achieved the 1997 250 cc World Championship with Max Biaggi.

The Yamaha works team was again associated with Marlboro between 1999 and 2002.

Marlboro sponsored the Ducati Corse MotoGP team from 2003. Casey Stoner took his first MotoGP title in 2007. As of the 2009 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season they were only allowed to brand the bikes at one round, in Qatar at the Losail International Circuit, using the barcode in other races. The controversial barcode design was then removed by Ducati for the start of the French motorcycle Grand Prix in the 2010 season. In January 2011 the Ducati Team presented a new logo which was regarded as a subliminal advertisement for Marlboro, evocating the top-left corner design of a Marlboro cigarettes pack, similar to the one used by Ferrari.

In January 2018, it was speculated that Ducati would carry sponsorship by Philip Morris&#x27; heat-not-burn brand iQOS instead, bypassing currently in-place laws that prohibit specific advertising of tobacco products.

===Superbike World Championship===
Marlboro sponsored the Yamaha Dealer Team from its inaugural season in 1988 to 1990.

===CART/IndyCar===
Marlboro sponsorship in IndyCar dates back to 1986 when the livery appeared on the Emerson Fittipaldi&#x27;s car entered by Patrick Racing. In 1990 Penske Racing hired Fittipaldi and started a 20 years-long association with Marlboro and its distinctive red and white livery. However, in the 2007 season Marlboro logos were hidden and subsequently replaced with Team Penske branding but the team retained the color scheme as Philip Morris USA was still Penske&#x27;s main sponsor (similar case to Scuderia Ferrari and Ducati MotoGP Team that had Marlboro sponsorship but both Ferrari and Ducati teams forced to hide the Marlboro logos due to anti-tobacco advertising law).

2009 was the final year of the Penske-Marlboro association.

=== 24 Hours of Le Mans ===
Since their start in Formula One, Marlboro has also sponsored numerous teams and races, from Joest Racing in Group C in 1983 to Toyota at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1999 (despite a tobacco ban in France).

===Masters of Formula 3===
Marlboro sponsored the Marlboro Masters Formula Three race in Zandvoort.

===World Rally Championship===

Marlboro has a long history in rallying sponsorship, including the factory World Rally Championship teams of Lancia (between 1972 and 1974), Mitsubishi (from to ) and Peugeot (from to ). The cigarette brand appeared on helmets and suits of some of the best rally drivers, being personal sponsor of Markku Alén, Timo Salonen, Juha Kankkunen, Miki Biasion and others. Between 1987 and 1992, Marlboro backed Carlos Sainz, appearing on his cars (Ford Sierra in 1987–88 and then Toyota Celica since 1989). In 1993 the cigarette brand started an association with Belgian rally driver Freddy Loix, who was racing for Opel in the Belgian rally championship. Between 1996 and 1998 Loix raced with Toyota Team Belgium in the WRC, carrying the Marlboro livery on his car. In 1999 he moved to Mitsubishi Ralliart works team, with the iconic livery remaining on successive Lancer Evolutions until the marque&#x27;s temporary WRC withdrawal at the end of 2002.

Marlboro also sponsored the cars of Emirati rally driver Mohammed bin Sulayem and has sponsored a number of rallies including the Safari Rally (between 1982 and 1990), the Rally Argentina, the Rally of Lebanon, the Jordan Rally, and the UAE Desert Challenge.

===Australian touring car racing===

===IMSA SportsCar===

===Badminton===
Marlboro sponsored the Thomas and Uber Cup from 1984 to 1990, as well as the Sudirman Cup from 1991 to 1995 and 2001 to 2013.

==Products==
Phillip Morris markets cigarettes, snus, and HeatSticks under the Marlboro brand.

===International cigarette varieties===
Philip Morris International organized Marlboro products into three divisions—&quot;Flavor line&quot;, which are original red full flavor cigarettes, &quot;Gold line&quot; are former lights, and &quot;Fresh line&quot; comprises flavored cigarettes.

In the UK, the company sells Marlboro Red, Gold, Touch and Silver King Size. In May 2020, all brands of menthol cigarettes, including Marlboro Menthol and Marlboro Ice Blast Capsule cigarettes were banned in the European Union.

In the Philippines, Marlboro has 5 cigarette variants, Marlboro Classic (also known as &quot;Marlboro Red&quot;), Marlboro Gold (first known and well-known as &quot;Marlboro Lights&quot;), Marlboro Black Menthol (simply &quot;Marlboro Black&quot;), Marlboro Purple Fusion (or Purple Mix) and Marlboro Ice Blast Mega (known as &quot;Marlboro Blue&quot;, a companion brand of &quot;Fortune Mint Splash&quot; in the Philippines).

==Marlboro in Canada==
Philip Morris sold the Canadian rights to the &quot;Marlboro&quot; name to Imperial Tobacco Canada in 1932. After the brand&#x27;s successful American relaunch in the 1950s, Philip Morris tried several legal manoeuvres in attempting to reacquire the Canadian rights. Imperial Tobacco continued to sell a line of cigarettes under the Marlboro name in Canada, albeit with different packaging from that of the Philip Morris product. Philip Morris retains the rights to the &quot;rooftop&quot; trade dress and other elements of Marlboro&#x27;s branding which were developed after the 1932 sale and has used that trade dress in Canada in combination with the names &quot;Matador&quot; or occasionally &quot;Maverick&quot; for a line of Virginia blend cigarettes.

In 2006, Philip Morris International&#x27;s Canadian affiliate Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges introduced a new product with the &quot;rooftop&quot; trade dress, and marked as being the &quot;World Famous Imported Blend&quot;, but not bearing any actual brand name. This led to a legal challenge from Imperial, contending that the new packaging created customer confusion by merely &quot;suggesting&quot; the Marlboro brand, thereby infringing on Imperial&#x27;s Canadian trademark rights. Canada&#x27;s Federal Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Imperial in June 2012. The judgment noted that Canadian regulations which (in most cases) prohibit the public display of tobacco products at retail locations – i.e., customers must ask for a brand by name – exacerbated the situation, as there were now two products that customers might be referring to when asking for &quot;Marlboro&quot;. Though PMI attempted to appeal the decision, shortly after the ruling it began using the brand name &quot;Rooftop&quot; on packaging for the previously unbranded cigarettes. The Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear PMI&#x27;s appeal the following year.

== Morley ==
Morley is a fictional brand of cigarettes whose packaging resembles Marlboro&#x27;s original packaging. The fictional brand has appeared in various television shows, films, and video games that otherwise have no apparent connection to each other. The name &quot;Morley&quot; is a play on &quot;Marleys&quot;, a nickname for Marlboro cigarettes. Morleys appear at least as far back as 1960, in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Psycho&quot;. There is also a Morley Lights version, in a gold and white package (similar to Marlboro Lights), marked &quot;Lights&quot;.

Morleys were iconically smoked by the Cigarette Smoking Man, a major character of the 90s sci-fi TV series The X-Files. The Morley Cigarettes packet is noted as one of the most recognisable props used throughout the series.

The Morley packaging is sold to production companies by the Earl Hays Press, a century-old Hollywood prop packaging service.

Using non-brand name products like Morley cigarettes dates back to early American television. Cigarette companies often sponsored entire TV shows and advertised through product placement, but if no cigarette companies agreed to pay, producers instead used a non-brand product. This concept was later expanded to TV shows, films, video games and other media.

<text>The National Movement for Stability and Progress (, NDSV) is a liberal, populist political party in Bulgaria. It was known as the National Movement Simeon II () until 3 June 2007.

The party was created as a personal vehicle of Simeon of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Simeon II), the last Bulgarian Tsar (albeit nominally), who was deposed following the 1944 Bulgarian coup d&#x27;état, for his successful bid to become Prime Minister of Bulgaria in 2001. Simeon served as prime minister until 2005 and the party remained part of the governing coalition until 2009, when they lost all their seats in the National Assembly.

== History ==
===Foundation and government===
NDSV was founded in April 2001, only 11 weeks ahead of a parliamentary election, after former Tsar Simeon II had announced his intention to become involved in the political life of Bulgaria. He promised to attract foreign investors, reduce taxes and uproot corruption within the first 800 days of his premiership. The movement met with immediate enthusiasm and won 42.7% of the popular vote and 120 out of 240 seats in the 2001 elections. One seat short of an absolute majority, it formed a coalition with the ethnic minority party Movement for Rights and Freedoms with Simeon Sakskoburggotski (his official name in Bulgarian since the end of monarchy) becoming prime minister. NDSV&#x27;s popularity decreased markedly when Simeon failed to fulfill his promises within the specified time. However, it was during Simeon&#x27;s term that Bulgaria entered NATO and prepared the economic and political stability that was prerequisite for the country becoming a member of the European Union in 2007. The NDSV party became a full member of the Liberal International at its Sofia Congress in May 2005.

===Decline===
At the 2005 parliamentary election, NDSV&#x27;s share of votes dropped to 19.9% and its number of seats in parliament dropped to 53. It did, however, remain in office as the junior partner in a coalition led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party. NDSV member Meglena Kuneva served as Bulgarian EU Commissioner charged with consumer protection in the First Barroso Commission from Bulgaria&#x27;s entry to the EU in 2007 until 2010. The party changed its name in June 2007, removing the name of the founder and leader and replacing it with &quot;Stability and Progress&quot;, but retaining its Bulgarian acronym NDSV. At the European parliamentary election of June 2009 the party gained 7.96% of the votes and took two out of the seventeen seats. However, a month later the party got just 3.01% of votes in the July 2009 parliamentary elections, falling short of the 4% election threshold for representation. The next day, on 6 July, Simeon resigned as NDSV leader. In July 2012 Meglena Kuneva left the party to establish the Bulgaria for Citizens Movement. In the 2013 parliamentary election, the NDSV did not field any candidates. In the 2014 election, it won just 0.24% of the votes, while the party decided not to run in the 2017 election. The party did not participate in any of the elections in 2021 for failure to gain the 2,500 signatures required. The party would not stand for any of the elections in 2021, in April, July or November and did not stand for the 2022 Bulgarian parliamentary election.

===Revival===
Following the 2014 election, the party&#x27;s national council elected Stanimir Ilchev, Olimpi Katev, and Sabi Davidov, as co-chairmen of the party in their 8th convocation in 2015. There would not be another convocation of the national council until 2023. The council, which had largely been vacant, was revitalized and former prime minister Ognyan Gerdzhikov announced in December 2022 that the party&#x27;s national council was formed and that they would convene for a 9th convocation to elect a new chairman of the party in January of 2023. Ilchev was elected the party&#x27;s sole chairman. A month before this announcement Simeon Sakskoburggotski held a closed door meeting with the Russian ambassador. The party received 0.26% of the vote in the 2023 Bulgarian parliamentary election well below the 4% threshold for seats in the National Assembly.

On 12 May 2023, NDSV held a party conference, at which it was agreed that a re-branding of the party was necessary, additionally, major organizational flaws inside the party were noted by its Chairman, Stranimir Ilchev.

<text>The International Socialist Organisation is a Trotskyist organisation in New Zealand.

The founders of the ISO in New Zealand, notably Brian Roper and Laurel Hepburn, were active in the International Socialist Organisation in Australia, a section of the International Socialism current. Returning to New Zealand, they formed the Dunedin-based ISO in the early 1990s. The organisation played a leading role in the student protest movement of the early 1990s.

As a result of its own development, the Communist Party of New Zealand was also attracted to the International Socialism current, and developed links with the British Socialist Workers Party, the leading representative of that current. This meant that there were two competing representatives of the same political ideology in New Zealand, which led to the SWP brokering a fusion between the two groups.

The ISO and CPNZ fused in the 1990s to form the Socialist Workers Organization. However, a majority of the former ISO soon left as a result of what were seen as Stalinist practices on the part of the former CPNZ leadership. The ISO then resumed its separate existence, and expanded from Dunedin to form a branch in Wellington. The Wellington branch reopened in 2012 after being closed for several years. An Auckland branch was established in 2013. Branches in all three centres continue to function, with strong orientation around the university campuses.

The ISO&#x27;s publication, Socialist Review, has been produced sporadically over the lifetime of the organisation. It passed its 50th issue in 2014.

The ISO has been active in anti-war campaigns, environmental campaigns, and union work (with the Unite Union, the Engineering, Printon and Manufacturing Union, the Public Service Association and the Tertiary Education Union). In the 2011 election, the ISO supported the Mana Party. The ISO was part of the Mana movement, until democratic consensus determined that the ISO would withdraw from the Mana movement in early 2015

The ISO has close ties with Socialist Alternative in Australia.

<text>The Social Democratic Party of Croatia (, SDP) is a social democratic political party in Croatia. The SDP is anti-fascist, progressive, and strongly pro-European. The SDP was formed in 1990 as the successor of the League of Communists of Croatia, the Croatian branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which had governed Croatia within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since World War II.

The party first won the elections in 2000 and formed a coalition government headed by Ivica Račan. After losing the 2003 general election, the party remained in opposition for eight years. In the 2011 parliamentary election, SDP won 61 out of 151 seats in the Croatian Parliament, and managed to form the 12th Croatian Government under Zoran Milanović with its partners from the Kukuriku coalition. After SDP and its coalition partners failed to achieve an agreement on forming a new government following the 2015 general election, the party returned to the opposition. Former SDP member and presidential candidate Ivo Josipović served as the third President of Croatia from 2010 to 2015. Another SDP member, Neven Mimica was the European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development at the Juncker Commission.

The SDP is a member of the Party of European Socialists (PES), Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), Progressive Alliance (PA), and the Socialist International (SI).

==History==
===Early 1990s===

The SDP was established on 3 November 1990 by the social democratic faction of the former League of Communists of Croatia (SKH), the Croatian branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ).

If SDP is claimed successor of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia founded on 8 and 9 September 1894, it was the oldest social democratic party in Yugoslavia, before become Communist Party of Croatia as part of League of Communists of Yugoslavia, founded date of modern day social-democratic party is taken on 3 November 1990.

SKH delegation led by Ivica Račan, along with their Slovenian counterparts, had abandoned the 14th congress of SKJ in January 1990 following a dispute with the Serbian delegation led by Slobodan Milošević over how SFR Yugoslavia should be reorganized.

At the same time, Croatia was preparing for its first multi-party election following the decision made by SKH in December 1989 which envisioned elections in April and May 1990. In February 1990 the SR Croatia parliament adopted amendments to the constitution which enabled a multi-party system. That same month SKH had rebranded themselves as the &quot;Party of Democratic Reform&quot; (&quot;Stranka demokratskih promjena&quot; or SDP) and went on to run in the 1990 election as SKH-SDP, coming in second behind the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) with 26 percent of votes and a total of 107 seats in all three houses of parliament which had 351 seat.

On 3 November 1990, the party was officially established in its current form, by dropping the initialism SKH from its name. In the August 1992 election, the first election held according to the new Constitution of Croatia which had been adopted on 22 December 1990, SDP won 5.52% of the popular vote and a total of 11 seats in the 138-seat parliament. In 1993 the party re-branded themselves again and changed their name to the &quot;Social Democratic Party&quot; (&quot;Socijaldemokratska partija&quot;), the name they kept to this day.

===Merger with SDH===
In 1990, a parallel Social Democratic Party of Croatia (, SDSH) was founded. It was later renamed to the Social Democrats of Croatia (&quot;Socijaldemokrati Hrvatske&quot;, SDH). Like most parties created at the time, it was opposed to the communist government and wanted Croatia to secede from Yugoslavia, yet it had the distinction of being one of the few to present itself as left-wing. The party founders included many prominent intellectuals, including Antun Vujić and Miroslav Tuđman. This party claimed that it was continuing tradition of the historical Social Democratic Party of Croatia, created in 1894 and merged in 1919 into the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.

In the first 1990 Croatian parliamentary election, SDSH joined the centrist Coalition of People&#x27;s Accord and fared badly, winning only 21 out of 351 seats. However, its position was strong enough to warrant ministerial posts in the national unity government of Franjo Gregurić which was in power from July 1991 to August 1992. However, its two ministers Bosiljko Mišetić and Zvonimir Baletić defected to the conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) soon after their appointment.

Before the 1992 parliamentary and presidential elections, SDSH was involved in bitter dispute with the SDP over its rebranding into the Social Democratic Party of Croatia. SDSH claimed that its name was stolen. The election showed SDP to be much stronger party than SDSH, which failed to win parliament seats. At the same time, SDSH leader Antun Vujić finished last in the 1992 presidential race, winning a meagre 0.7 percent of the vote. This ultimately led to SDSH and SDP patching their differences and former being incorporated into the latter in April 1994.

In the following 1995 election, SDP won 8.93 percent of the popular vote and a total of 10 seats in the parliament, coming in fourth behind the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS).

===Račan government (2000–2003)===

In August 1998, SDP and HSLS leaders Ivica Račan and Dražen Budiša signed a coalition agreement and proceeded to run together in the January 2000 parliamentary elections. The SDP-HSLS coalition won the election with 38.7% of the vote and 71 out of 151 seats. SDP and HSLS then formed a six-way centre-left coalition government along with the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the Liberal Party (LS), Croatian People&#x27;s Party (HNS), and the Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS). Račan, as the leader of the strongest party, became prime minister in the first Račan cabinet. This period was marred with constant disagreements among coalition members on various issues. The constitution was changed several times.

Račan had initially offered the post of Speaker of Parliament to Budiša, but Budiša declined hoping to win the upcoming 2000 presidential election. Following Budiša&#x27;s defeat to Stjepan Mesić in February 2000, Budiša continued to serve as member of Croatian parliament. In July 2001, he opposed Račan government&#x27;s decision to extradite Croatian army generals which were wanted because of, later in 2013 dismissed, charges for committing war crimes during Croatian War of Independence to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) which caused considerable turmoil within HSLS.

In June 2001, the Istrian regionalist party Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS) withdrew from the coalition government and its chairman Ivan Jakovčić resigned his post as Minister of European Integration, citing criticism of the way they governed Istria on the regional level which had been coming from other parties within the ruling coalition. The uneasy coalition broke apart in early July 2002 when Račan formally handed in his resignation following HSLS refusal to support the agreement made with Slovenia concerning the two countries&#x27; joint control of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant.

In late July 2002, the second Račan cabinet was formed, with members of the remaining four parties of the original coalition (following the departure of IDS and HSLS) plus two minor liberal parties which had splintered from HSLS, the Party of Liberal Democrats (Libra) and the Liberal Party (LS). This cabinet remained in power until the next elections in November 2003. SDP then ran in the 2003 election as part of a coalition with IDS, Libra and LS, but was defeated by the conservative HDZ. The SDP thus returned to opposition with the coalition winning 43 out of 151 seats in the parliament (34 of which held by SDP).

The January 2000 election win and the defeat of the ruling HDZ was seen as a turning point as it marked the first transition of power in Croatia&#x27;s young democracy and upon coming into power Račan&#x27;s government was seen as the country&#x27;s first staunchly pro-Western government following a decade of the &quot;authoritarian and nationalist rule&quot; of late President Franjo Tuđman. During its term, the country signed a pre-membership agreement with the European Union, which paved the way for the formal opening of membership negotiations in October 2006. Although the six-party coalition government made a clear break from the former regime, it nevertheless failed to handle the growing social problems, unemployment and economic difficulties. Račan struggled to contain factional disputes within the coalition and appeared indecisive in dealing with Western demands to hand over war crimes suspects to the ICTY, as well as with extremists at home who vehemently opposed such extraditions.

===Opposition (2003–2011)===
In the 2005 presidential race, SDP opted to support independent incumbent Stjepan Mesić, who succeeded in winning his second term by an overwhelming majority of 65.9% of the vote in the run-off in front of HDZ candidate and runner-up Jadranka Kosor with 34.1%.

In 2007, the party was dealt a blow due to the death of their long-time leader and founder Ivica Račan, who died on 30 April 2007 due to complications from his previously treated kidney cancer, after he stepped down from his chairman post earlier that month. In an extraordinary party convention, former party spokesman Zoran Milanović was elected as their new leader, beating acting chairwoman and former defence minister Željka Antunović in the party election run-off. Other prominent candidates for the post were Zagreb mayor Milan Bandić and former foreign minister Tonino Picula.

For the November 2007 parliamentary election, SDP ran on an economic program with Third Way elements devised by the previously non-partisan economist Ljubo Jurčić, who was also picked to be the party&#x27;s candidate for the post of prime minister in case of their election victory at a party meeting in July 2007. In the election of 25 November SDP finished a close second behind HDZ, with 56 out of 153 seats. It might have won the domestic election, but as SDP does not participate in diaspora constituency, it lost in the overall tally. Five days after the election, amid speculations that SDP might assemble a governing coalition in spite of them failing to win outright majority, he was replaced in that role by Zoran Milanović. Nevertheless, SDP failed to assemble a governing coalition, and positioned itself as the largest opposition party instead.
In the subsequent June 2009 local elections, the party failed to make significant gains on the county level, but still managed to achieve some major wins in important cities, due to the adoption of a new election system where mayors and county heads were for the first time elected directly, as opposed to the previous system which employed party lists. SDP recorded mayoral victories in a number of traditionally centre-right leaning coastal cities such as Dubrovnik, Šibenik and Trogir and also managed to win in Vukovar, a city that had been almost destroyed in the Croatian War of Independence and was regarded as HDZ stronghold ever since. They also manage to retain control of the economically most powerful parts of the country, including the capital Zagreb, the northern Adriatic city of Rijeka and also won in Istria (in coalition with IDS).

In the run up to the 2009–10 presidential race, SDP held a primary election for the very first time, in which party nominees Ljubo Jurčić and Ivo Josipović ran. Josipović won the primary by some two-thirds of the vote. Josipović later won the 2009–10 election with 60% of the vote in the second round in front of former SDP member and populist Mayor of Zagreb Milan Bandić (who was expelled that year for running in the elections) and was officially inaugurated on 18 February 2010.

===Milanović government (2011–15)===
In 2010, SDP formed a political alliance known as the Kukuriku coalition with three other centre-left parties – the Croatian People&#x27;s Party – Liberal Democrats (HNS), Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS) and the Croatian Party of Pensioners (HSU) – to run in the December 2011 parliamentary election. The coalition unveiled their 21-point campaign program on 15 September 2011 in Zagreb.

The coalition won the election, winning 81 out of 151 seats in the parliament, after which SDP formed a government with two of its junior coalition (HNS and IDS). Party president, Zoran Milanović, took office as the new Prime Minister and leader of his cabinet on 23 December 2011.

The Milanović administration started its mandate by introducing several liberal reforms. During 2012, a Law on medically assisted fertilization was enacted, health education was introduced in all elementary and high schools, and Milanović announced further expansion of rights for same-sex couples. On 1 December 2013, a constitutional referendum was held in Croatia, organized by the citizen initiative &quot;For the family&quot;, creating a constitutional prohibition against same-sex marriage. SDP was one of the leading forces campaigning against the proposal. The referendum passed with 65% votes in favour. Milanović announced the Life Partnership Act which passed on 15 July 2014.

The government&#x27;s mandate was marked by several crises the cabinet had to deal with, including a six-year economic recession, the 2013 anti-Cyrillic protests, war veterans protests, the 2015 Croatia–Slovenia border disputes arbitration scandal and the European migrant crisis.

A new fiscalization law and the government&#x27;s pursuit of dealing with the swiss francs crisis are regarded as some of SDP&#x27;s biggest successes in power. In January 2015, the government decided to freeze exchange rates for Swiss francs for a year, after a rise in the franc that caused increasingly expensive loans for borrowers in that currency. In August 2015, Milanović announced that Swiss franc loans will be converted into euro-denominated ones.

The administration adopted a number of reforms in taxation in order to cope with the difficult economic situation amid the Great Recession. It also cut social insurance contributions and public-sector wages. The government succeeded in reducing the budget deficit to 5.3% in 2012, but GDP contracted by 2.2% and public debt reached 69.2%. Milanović&#x27;s time in office has been marked by several cuts to Croatia&#x27;s credit rating. The unemployment rate peaked in February 2014 at 22.7%.

A bad economic situation weakened the originally strong public support for the Milanović government, which was demonstrated in the 2013 local elections. In the first European Parliament elections in Croatia in 2013, SDP won 32% of the votes and five MEPs, one less than HDZ, the largest opposition party. The following year SDP&#x27;s coalition won 29.9% in the 2014 European Parliament elections and four MEPs. The party supported Ivo Josipović in the presidential elections, which were won by Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović from the HDZ. Josipović later formed his own party, Forward Croatia-Progressive Alliance, instead of returning to the SDP. He eventually rejoined the party in 2019.

===Opposition (2015–present)===
In the 2015 parliamentary elections, SDP and its coalition partners won the majority in 5 out of 10 electoral districts, and eventually gained 56 out of 151 seats in the Parliament, or 59 since Istrian Democratic Assembly participated in the post-election negotiations on forming new government as &quot;de facto&quot; member of the coalition. After more than 70 days of negotiations with the Bridge of Independent Lists (MOST) and numerous twists and turns mainly due to MOST frequently changing terms, SDP&#x27;s coalition failed to achieve agreement with MOST on forming new government, which was formed by the independent Tihomir Orešković who was supported by the center-right Patriotic Coalition.

On 2 April 2016, elections were held for the party&#x27;s leadership. Zlatko Komadina, the prefect of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County, who advocated for a &quot;much more social democratic&quot; SDP, ran against Milanović. Milanović was again re-elected president of SDP for the next four years.

A vote of no confidence in Orešković in June 2016 resulted in an early parliamentary election in November which the SDP contested as the largest party in the People&#x27;s Coalition. Despite being perceived as the favorite to win the election, due to a significant lead in a large number of opinion polls, the People&#x27;s Coalition won only 54 seats while the Croatian Democratic Union won 58 (61 with coalition partners) in an upset. As a result, Zoran Milanović declared that he would not contest the upcoming leadership election in the SDP and that he would retire from politics once a successor is elected. The first round of the leadership election on 19 November 2016 failed to produce an outright winner, as none of the seven candidates gained the necessary majority of 50% + 1 of cast votes. Davor Bernardić received the most votes (46%) and progressed to the second round, where he faced the runner-up, Ranko Ostojić, who received 22.8% of cast votes. The second round took place on 26 November 2016 and Davor Bernardić was elected the 3rd chairman of the SDP with 64% of cast votes.

In the 2020 parliamentary elections, the SDP achieved its worst result in parliamentary elections since the 1990s, resulting to the resignation of Davor Bernardić the day after the election. Zlatko Komadina took over the temporary duty of party leader until the next internal party elections. Five candidates ran in the party&#x27;s leader elections, for which voting took place on September 26 and October 3. Peđa Grbin was chosen as the new leader, who defeated Željko Kolar in the second round. The elections were also marked by allowing only members who had paid their membership fees to vote, which meant that 12,000 out of 32,000 of all members had the right to vote.

In July 2021, intra-party clashes broke out between supporters of Grbin and Bernardić, followed by the expulsion of four MPs on charges of doing damage to party or refusing to actively participate in the May local elections. The same MPs then refused to leave the SDP parliamentary club, and for that they received the support of 14 of their colleagues who refused to vote for their expulsion. The crisis was resolved at a session of the party&#x27;s presidency when a decision was made to punish 14 supporters of ousted MPs. According to the decision, seven deputies were expelled, including Davor Bernardić, while the remaining seven were warned. In the end, the expelled MPs and those who supported them founded a new parliamentary club called the Social Democrats Club, which had 18 deputies, while the SDP club was left with the remaining 14 deputies, which put them in third place in terms of the number of deputies in the Sabor. On 9 July 2022, they founded a new party named the Social Democrats.

==Organization==
The party&#x27;s first and longest-serving president was Ivica Račan. The current party president is Siniša Hajdaš Dončić, who was elected in a leadership election on 21 September 2024 following Peđa Grbin&#x27;s resignation. Apart from the president and four vice-presidents (Biljana Borzan, Mirela Ahmetović, Ranko Ostojić, Mišel Jakšić), the main governing bodies of the party include the party presidency (&quot;Predsjedništvo&quot;, consisting of 18 elected members), the head committee (&quot;Glavni odbor&quot;) and the supervisory committee (&quot;Nadzorni odbor&quot;).

Like all other parties, the SDP runs local chapters at municipal, city and county levels. It also runs four topical groups – the Youth Forum (&quot;Forum mladih&quot;), Women&#x27;s Forum (&quot;Socijaldemokratski forum žena&quot;), Seniors&#x27; Forum (&quot;Socijaldemokratski forum seniora&quot;) and the SDP Queer Forum.

The SDP has been a member of the Socialist International since November 1999, and a full member of the Party of European Socialists since February 2012. SDP is also a full member of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) group in the European Parliament as of the accession of Croatia to the EU in 2013.

<text>The NCAA Division I Football Championship is an annual post-season college football game, played since 2006, used to determine a national champion of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). From 1978 to 2005, the game was called the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship, during the period when the FCS was known as NCAA Division I-AA.

The game serves as the final match of an annual postseason bracket tournament between top teams in FCS. Since 2013, 24 teams normally participate in the tournament, with some teams receiving automatic bids upon winning their conference championship, and other teams determined by a selection committee. The reigning national champions are the North Dakota State Bison, who have won 10 championships since the 2011 season.

The FCS is the highest division in college football to hold a playoff tournament sanctioned by the NCAA to determine its champion, as the College Football Playoff currently used by the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) is not NCAA-sanctioned.

==History==
===Playoff format===
In the inaugural season of Division I-AA, the 1978 postseason included just four teams; three regional champions (East, West, and South) plus an at-large selection. The field doubled to eight teams in 1981, with champions of five conferences—Big Sky, Mid-Eastern, Ohio Valley, Southwestern, and Yankee—receiving automatic bids. The top four teams were seeded, and then matched against the four remaining teams based on geographical proximity. The tournament was expanded to 12 teams in 1982, with each of the top four seeds receiving a first-round bye and a home game in the quarterfinals. Champions of the Southern and Southland conferences also received automatic bids.

The number of automatic bids has varied over time, due to changes in the number and size of conferences, with an automatic bid typically granted only to champions of conferences with at least six teams. Initially, the tournament was played in December; since the expansion to twelve teams in 1982, earlier rounds have been held in late November.

The playoffs expanded to a 16-team format in 1986, requiring four postseason victories to win the title. Initially, only the top four teams were seeded, with other teams geographically placed in the bracket. From 1995 through 2000, all 16 teams were seeded, independent of geography. In 2001, the number of seeded teams was reduced to four, with the seeded teams assured of home games in early tournament rounds, and other teams once again placed in the bracket to minimize travel. Home team designation in games between unseeded teams is determined based on several factors, including attendance history and revenue potential.

In April 2008, the NCAA announced that the playoff field would expand to 20 teams in 2010, with the Big South and Northeast Conference earning automatic bids for the first time. That bracket structure included seeding of the top five teams. Twelve teams received first-round byes; the remaining eight teams played first-round games, with the four winners advancing to face the top four seeds. The playoffs expanded to 24 teams beginning in 2013, with the champion of the Pioneer Football League receiving an automatic bid for the first time. The number of seeded teams was increased to eight, with the 16 unseeded teams playing in first-round games. The unseeded teams continue to be paired according to geographic proximity and then placed in the bracket according to geographic proximity to the top eight seeds. Teams cannot travel more than 400 miles via ground, and teams from the same conference that played each other during the regular season are not paired for first-round games. For the 2020 season, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the bracket was reduced to 16 teams. The bracket returned to 24 teams for the 2021 season.

The field is traditionally set the Sunday before Thanksgiving and play begins that weekend.


====Team selection====
At-large selections and seeding within the bracket are determined by the FCS Playoff Selection Committee, which consists of one athletic director from each conference with an automatic bid. As of the 2018 season, there were 10 conferences with automatic bids and the selection committee made 14 at-large selections. An 11th automatic bid was added as of the 2021 season, reducing the number of at-large selections to 13.

===Championship final===

The tournament culminates with the national final, played between the two remaining teams from the playoff bracket. Unlike earlier round games in each year&#x27;s playoff, which are played at campus sites, the title game is played at a site predetermined by the NCAA, akin to how the NFL predetermines the site for each Super Bowl. Originally played in December, with the 2010 expansion to a 20-team field, the final moved to January, with two or three weeks between the semifinals and final.

The inaugural title game was played in 1978 in Wichita Falls, Texas. The 1979 and 1980 games were held in Orlando, Florida, and Sacramento, California, respectively, and the game returned to Wichita Falls for 1981 and 1982. The games played in Wichita Falls were known as the Pioneer Bowl, while the game played in Sacramento was known as the Camellia Bowl—both names were used for various NCAA playoff games played in those locations, and were not specific to the I-AA championship. In 1983 and 1984, the game was played in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1985 and 1986, Tacoma, Washington, hosted the game, which the NCAA branded as the &quot;Diamond Bowl&quot;.

The 1987 and 1988 games were played in Pocatello, Idaho; and from 1989 through 1991, in Statesboro, Georgia. The 1992 through 1996 games were held in Huntington, West Virginia; and from 1997 through 2009, the title game was played in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

From 2010 through the 2024 season, the title game was played in Frisco, Texas, a suburb north of Dallas, at Toyota Stadium, a multi-purpose stadium primarily used by FC Dallas of Major League Soccer. The stadium was known as Pizza Hut Park until the day after the final of the 2011 season, and then as FC Dallas Stadium until September 2013. The original contract with Frisco began in the 2010 season and ran through the 2012 season. The contract was extended three times; first through the 2015 season, then through the 2019 season, and finally through the 2024 season with an option for the 2025 season.

For at least 2026 and 2027, the title game will be played at FirstBank Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee, home of the Vanderbilt Commodores, due to renovations beginning at Toyota Stadium following the 2025 title game.

==== Details ====

;Notes
There have been six instances where a team whose venue was predetermined to host the final game advanced to play for the championship on its own field. Georgia Southern won both title games it played at Paulson Stadium, while Marshall had a 2–2 record in four title games it played at Marshall University Stadium (now known as Joan C. Edwards Stadium).

===Non-participants===
As of the 2025 season, two FCS conferences usually do not participate in the tournament: the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) and Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC).

The Ivy League has been at the FCS level since 1982 and prohibits its members from awarding athletic scholarships in any sport and plays a strict ten-game regular season. Through the 2024 season, it did not participate in any postseason football, citing academic concerns. The Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (consisting of student-athletes at all sports, including those who participated in the NCAA tournament in their respective sport) recommended the change be reversed, and on December 18, 2024, the Ivy League announced starting with the 2025 season, the league champion will participate in the tournament.

The MEAC and SWAC, two conferences consisting of historically black colleges and universities, opt to play the Celebration Bowl (which was established in 2015) instead of the FCS tournament. MEAC gave up its automatic spot in the tournament prior to the 2015 season, while the SWAC&#x27;s regular season extends through the Turkey Day Classic and Bayou Classic at the end of November and the SWAC Championship Game is played in December. Teams from the MEAC and SWAC may accept at-large bids, so long as they aren&#x27;t committed to other postseason games that would conflict with the tournament. The most recent MEAC and SWAC teams to accept bids were the 2023 North Carolina Central Eagles and 2021 Florida A&amp;M Rattlers, respectively.

Historically, conferences in FCS that did not offer athletic scholarships were not granted automatic bids into the tournament and, although in theory were eligible for at-large bids, never received any. The last non-scholarship conference in the subdivision, the Pioneer Football League, now receives a tournament bid, which was initiated with the 2013 postseason.

* The Yankee Conference, Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10), and CAA Football, although separately chartered, are effectively the same entity in football. The Yankee Conference, formerly an all-sports conference but a football-only league since 1976, was effectively merged into the A-10 after the 1996 season. In turn, the A-10 shut down its football league after the 2006 season, with the multi-sports Colonial Athletic Association (since renamed the Coastal Athletic Association) taking over administration of that league as the separate entity of CAA Football. 
* Teams from the same conference have met in the championship game following the 2014 and 2022 seasons. Both matchups involved MVFC teams.

<text>Foscott (also called Foxcote and Foscote) is a hamlet and civil parish in north Buckinghamshire, England. At the 2011 Census the population of the hamlet was included in the civil parish of Thornton. In the 20th century a reservoir was built within Foscote, named Foxcote Reservoir. It is just to the north of Maids Moreton.

The name was Anglo Saxon in origin, meaning &quot;Fox cottage&quot;.

== Population of Foscott ==
In the earliest government census of 1801, there were 85 inhabitants in 17 families living in 17 houses recorded in Foscott.

== Rectors of the Parish Church of St Leonard, Foscott ==
According to George Lipscomb&#x27;s 1847 &quot;The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckingham&quot; there were 39 rectors of the Parish of Foscott, between 1220 and 1840. The church was converted into a private residence in the 1970s.

<text>The People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice (, PFDJ) is the founding, ruling, and sole legal political party of the State of Eritrea. The successor to the  Marxist–Leninist Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF), the PFDJ regards itself as a left-wing nationalist party, though it holds itself open to nationalists of any political affiliation. The leader of the party and current President of Eritrea is Isaias Afwerki. The PFDJ has been described as totalitarian, and under its rule Eritrea reached the status of the least electorally democratic country in Africa according to V-Dem Democracy indices in 2023.

== Creation ==
The Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF), later (from 1994) People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice, formed from the secessionist movement that successfully fought for the creation of an independent Eritrean nation out of the northernmost province of Ethiopia in 1993.

The historical region of Eritrea had joined Ethiopia as an autonomous unit in 1952. The Eritrean Liberation Movement was founded in 1958 and was succeeded by the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) in 1961. The ELF grew in membership when the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie abolished Eritrea&#x27;s autonomous status, annexing it as a province in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, the ELF undertook a systematic campaign of guerrilla warfare against the Ethiopian government. A faction of the ELF broke away in 1970 to form the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front. The EPLF managed to secure control of much of the Eritrean countryside and build effective administrations in the areas it controlled. Fighting that broke out between the EPLF, ELF, and other Eritrean rebel groups in 1981 prevented further military gains, but the EPLF subsequently emerged as the principal Eritrean guerrilla group.

As Soviet support of Ethiopia&#x27;s socialist government collapsed in the late 1980s, the EPLF formed an alliance with guerrilla groups in Tigray province and other parts of Ethiopia. After the holding of a United Nations-supervised referendum on independence there in April 1993, the EPLF declared the new nation of Eritrea the following month.

At the third congress of the EPLF Front in February 1994, delegates voted to transform the 95,000‐person organization into a mass political movement, the People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ). The congress gave the PFDJ a transitional mandate to draw the general population into the political process and to prepare the country for constitutional democracy.

The leader of the PFDJ party and current President of Eritrea is Isaias Afewerki.

== Post-independence ==

Eritrea formed itself from a referendum with high voter participation. EPLF provisioned education, health, and other public services to save women, workers, and peasants from poverty and oppression. As a consequence, both domestic and foreign media expressed high hopes that Eritrea would develop a self-governed and democratic government. EPLF leaders at the time were perceived as a “new generation” of African leaders. They enjoyed high popularity rates among their constituents. They endorsed, at least theoretically, democracy, human rights, and free markets. They defined clear development policies based on their priorities.

In 1994, the PFDJ established a transitional 150-member National Assembly to determine the pending constitutions and elections. The assembly later chose the PFDJ&#x27;s secretary-general and the former EPLF leader, Isaias Afwerki as Eritrea&#x27;s president and formed a cabinet around him. In 1997, the National Assembly adopted a constitution for a multi-party democratic system. It scheduled multi-party elections for 1997. The new government appeared to practice separation of powers. However, the political institutions other than the executive office – the cabinet of ministers, a temporary parliament and a nominally independent judiciary – did not actually pose checks on the executive power. The cabinet did not provide a platform for debates. The military remained under the president&#x27;s control. The PFDJ has not held a party convention since January 2002.

== Ideological foundations ==
Eritrean nationalism constitutes the core of PFDJ&#x27;s ideology because it is perceived as a necessary process within the overall nation-building effort. To that end, the PFDJ advocates unity, equality and participation of all sections of Eritrean society as the bases for all its programs. Engagement as well as active contribution to the political, economic, social and cultural life of Eritrea is therefore perceived as a necessary precondition for social cohesion, stability and development of the country. To do so the PFDJ aims to establish a national government which ensures unity and equality for the people of Eritrea, rejects all divisive attitudes and activities, places national interest above everything else, and enables participation of all sectors of Eritrean society in the PFDJ. Moreover, all political establishments must be built on a national basis, and all sectarian political tendencies must be categorically rejected. All forms of discrimination and domination, including ethnic and regional, must also be rejected. The diverse cultures of Eritrea should be a source of power and unity. The national system should be secular, separate from religion, but respectful of the equality of established traditional religions. In short, nationhood is the basis of all political institutions and policies. The National Charter of the PFDJ was adopted in 1994 and sets out the key objectives the PFDJ is striving to achieve.

Those include:
#National Harmony – For the people of Eritrea to live in harmony, peace and stability, with no distinction along regional, ethnic, linguistic, religious, gender or class lines.
#Political Democracy – For the people of Eritrea to be active participants and decision-makers in the administration and conduct of their lives and of their country, with their rights guaranteed by law and in practice.
#Economic and Social Development – For Eritrea to progress socially and economically in the areas of education, technology and standard of living.
#Social Justice (Economic and Social Democracy) – Equitable distribution of wealth, services and opportunities, with special attention and focus on the most disadvantaged sections of society.
#Cultural Revival – Drawing on our rich cultural heritage and on the progressive values we developed during the liberation struggle, to develop an Eritrean culture characterized by love of one&#x27;s country, respect for humanity, solidarity between men and women, love of the truth and of justice, respect for law, hard work, self-confidence, self-reliance, open mindedness and inventiveness.
#Regional and International Cooperation – For Eritrea to become a respected member of the international community; by coexisting in harmony and cooperation with its neighbors; and by contributing to the extent of its capability to regional and global peace, security and development.

These six goals are supported by six basic principles which can serve as guidelines for political activities. These are national unity, active public participation, the human element, linkage between national and social struggles, self-reliance, and a strong relationship between people and the leadership. Self-reliance is considered an important underlying principle. Politically, it means to follow an independent line of thinking and to give priority to internal conditions; economically, to rely on internal capabilities and develop internal capacities; and culturally, to have self-confidence and develop one&#x27;s own cultural heritage. Self-reliance does not mean to isolate the country from the international community but to achieve a status of independence and self-confidence and be an [important] player in the international community.

== Political positions ==

Although the PFDJ lacks specific political programs covering concrete policies, its overall foundations are embedded in declared priorities including the establishment of a constitutional system which is built on nationalism and democracy. Nationalism is perceived as the safeguarding of national interests, development and the strengthening of the unity of the Eritrean people and preserving Eritrea. All political institutions should be established on a national basis, free from divisive sub-national sentiments and activities, strengthening and developing nationally coordinated efforts of the Eritrean people. In other words, the political system must have a broad social basis, enabling participation of all the people in both the rural and urban areas. Democracy as an important principle for the political system&#x27;s establishment is defined in a more general way by invoking the establishment of a people-based institution and public participation in decision making from the grass-roots to the national level.

In this regard, the PFDJ provides a specific approach in-line with historical development and conditions of Eritrean society. The party states that its understanding of democracy emphasizes its context rather than its external manifestations. In the context of Eritrean society, democracy should not be dependent on the number of political parties and regular elections, but on the actual participation of people in the decision-making process at community and national levels. What is being questioned here is not political parties as a manifestation of political pluralism with rights to organization and free expression and elections. Rather, the PFDJ challenges the concept of democracy in the political arena as experienced by several African (and other) countries in which the existence of various political parties and organized elections did not lead to a democratic system. Insistence on increased number of political parties and regularity of electoral schedule are therefore perceived by the PFDJ as narrow concepts which limit the meaning of democracy to its form.

Second, priority is given to the establishment of an economic system which satisfies the desires of the majority and improves their living conditions, ensures equitable development, operates through a market economy, encourages private investment, initiative and competition and guarantees balanced economic growth. In short, the economic system must enhance social justice for all.

Third, the PFDJ introduces socialist elements, defining social justice as the condition which allows: 1) the narrowing of the gap in economic opportunities and wealth between the rich and the poor to ensure equitable distribution of national wealth among all citizens; as well as 2) the narrowing of the development gap between the rural and urban areas, and between the center and periphery. Thus ensuring the balanced and fair distribution of economic development in the whole country.

Fourth, one of the key elements in nation-building, the PFDJ program sets out priorities, which include the development and evolution of Eritrean culture. This builds on the culture developed during the liberation struggle by ensuring the preservation and enhancement of the cultural heritage, with the integration of values drawn internationally.

Finally, program priorities also invoke the necessity of fair and proportionate distribution of social services (chiefly healthcare end education), the strong respect of women and other social rights of the Eritrean population as well as guaranteeing national security and defense and establishing regional and international cooperation.

== Organizational principles ==

The PFDJ was conceived as a broad-based movement with the capacity to embrace all segments of the population. The PFDJ was not to be representative of any particular social class, nor was it to be narrow-based, that is only embracing only those who were politically committed. The PFDJ was to ensure the right to form national political parties at the right time.

In its Charter, the PFDJ states that internal democratic life and the cultivation of popular participation are critical not only for the unity of the party, but also to clarify and enhance its policies, and to identify and correct any shortcomings.

The PFDJ Charter defines principles of relations between the Government and the party. In this sense it is stated, that even though the PFDJ has to play a major and critical role in the government, it is also to be independent of the government.

Although the PFDJ is organized as a broad-based and participatory entity, it does not attempt to be the only form of political organization. On the contrary, it encourages and assists the establishment of public associations with objectives similar to its programs, along social, trade and other non- sectarian lines. Finally, in terms of concrete organizational structure the PFDJ introduces a highly decentralized structure with presence in the majority of rural communities as well as within major urban centers. To do this, the party charter states that it has adopted a bottom-heavy, grassroots organizational structure instead of a top-heavy one.

== Judicial development ==
After independence, the PFDJ regime adopted the law of the ousted Ethiopian regime with some amendments in order to maintain law and order and avoid a legal vacuum. A committee of former senior fighters reviewed the old Ethiopian law regime to adapt the law to the newly formed state and make it compatible with the values and principles of the EPLF. Reviews revealed that basic principles of human rights and procedures of due process and models of judicial independence were not emphasized.

== Status ==
The People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice is the sole legal party in Eritrea.

There is some debate as to whether PFDJ is a true political party or whether it is a broad governing association in transition. Some observers perceive the PFDJ as a fairly amorphous, diffuse, transitional organization, and a nationalist umbrella, out of which spin-off parties could develop when the social and economic development advances to a level in which a multiparty system can be established and sustained. The PFDJ subscribes to a pluralist political system and as adopted in the Second Congress of the EPLF – during the liberation struggle – in 1987.

== PFDJ influence on public policy ==
The first attempt of the PFDJ to influence the country&#x27;s norms and values system immediately after the end of the independence war failed because the fighters were in the minority. The 1998–2000 border conflicts with Ethiopia presented the PFDJ with a second chance to impose its ideology on the society.

== U.S. sanctions ==
On 12 November 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control added the PFDJ to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list for being &quot;a political party that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, activities that have contributed to the crisis in northern Ethiopia or have obstructed a ceasefire or peace process to resolve such crisis&quot;.

<text>Frieth is a village in the parish of Hambleden, in Buckinghamshire, England. It lies on the top of &quot;Frieth Hill&quot;, which is part of the chalk escarpments of the Chiltern Hills.

Frieth lies at a height of around , on the edge of a broad and deep winterbourne chalk valley in which are located the older settlements of the parish and adjacent parishes – Hambleden, Skirmett, Turville, and Fingest. Because of the shortage of surface water and the relatively poor soils – heavy clay and flint overlaying the permeable chalk – Frieth did not develop into a village until well into Victorian times. However, there are a number of ancient properties and Frieth has all the symbols of a traditional English village. As well as the church, it has a village hall, a village green, two rural pubs, a village society, fine open hilly countryside, and a small but thriving primary school. The village shop and dairy has closed.

== Parmoor House ==
In the 12th century, Parmoor House was owned by the Knights Templar. After falling into ruin it was rebuilt by the new Earl of the hundred in 1352. The property was then lost to the crown around 1790 when the incumbent Earl was supplanted by George III with a John &quot;Frith&quot; whose surname was to be that of the village. Although Frith never took up residence, on his death in 1791, the property was bought by the Cripps Family of Berkshire. It was the birthplace of Sir Stafford Cripps, the post-war Chancellor of the Exchequer. During the war, it was let to King Zog of Albania. In 1947, the Anglican Community of St Katharine of Alexandria moved to Parmoor House from Fulham to provide care for elderly ladies. Later the house became home for the Community of the Sue Ryder Prayer Fellowship. St Katharine&#x27;s, Parmoor, Frieth, Henley-on-Thames is now a retreat home and conference centre welcoming all for day or residential visits.

== King Zog ==
During the Second World War Frieth was home to King Zog of Albania. King Zog lived at Parmoor House with his wife Queen Geraldine, their son Crown Prince Leka (the late King Leka I), and the King&#x27;s sisters, nephews and nieces. The King also had a group of bodyguards who lived nearby and some Ministers who lived at Lane End. After the war they left to go to Egypt but one nephew stayed in Frieth.

== Frieth Church ==
Frieth Church was built in 1848 as a chapel of ease for Hambleden. It is now part of the parish of Hambleden with Frieth and Skirmett. Flint from the ruined wing of the Old Rectory (now Kenricks) at Hambleden was used for the new church built to the design of JP Harrison. The South aisle was added later, probably by Woodyer dated 1872 on the rainwater heads. The church is built of flint with stone mullions and edges, and has an attractive tiled roof but no tower or turret.

The church is noted for its Victorian stained glass and carved woodwork. Most of the furniture and carving in the church were made by the local firm of West and Collier. Most of the beautiful stained glass windows were the gift of the Cripps family. They date from 1880 and include St John the Evangelist, Abraham and Isaac, Moses and the Ten Commandments (North wall), Benjamin and Joseph, and King David on the south aisle.

The Church Aided school at Frieth is the school for the Hambleden Valley. The school holds services at Frieth Church each term. The Rector is an &quot;ex officio&quot; Governor of the school.

== Frieth School ==
Frieth Church of England Combined School was established in 1865. The catchment area encompasses the many villages of the Hambleden Valley.

Every October, the PTA of the School organises a 10K run called the &quot;Frieth Hilly 10K&quot;. This race which starts/finishes at the School involves sections on road, trails and footpaths through woods and fields, including challenging off-road descents and ascents. The race was first held in 2008.

<doc id="404609" wikidata="Q1574327" url="?curid=404609" title="USL W-League (1995–2015)">
<text>The USL W-League was a North American amateur women&#x27;s soccer developmental organization. The league was a semi-professional, open league, giving college players the opportunity to play alongside established international players while maintaining their collegiate eligibility. The league was administered by the United Soccer Leagues system (the USL), which also oversees the men&#x27;s United Soccer League and Premier Development League. The W-League announced on November 6, 2015 that the league will cease operation ahead of 2016 season.

After the popularity of the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, though, USL began considerations for a new professional women&#x27;s league; this effort eventually returned to the re-establishing of the league as the USL W League.

==History==
The W-League&#x27;s inaugural season was in 1995. Originally called the United States Interregional Women&#x27;s League, it later changed its name to the W-League. Although at its inception some of the league&#x27;s franchises were barely above amateur level, it provided a professional outlet for many of the top female soccer players in the country. With professionals driving the level of play, the league made a very strong debut performance.

From 1995 through the 1997 season the W-League was a single tier format (all teams at the same division). This changed before the 1998 season when the W-League became a two tier league. The top tier/division was called W-1 and lower division, W-2. This division was in effect through the 2001 season – the first year of the new US Women&#x27;s first division league WUSA. The W-League returned to a single tier format in the 2002 season.

The W-League grew to a maximum of 41 teams for the 2008 season, but then began contracting rapidly. By the time the league suspended operations in 2015, there were three, six-team conferences. Of those 18 teams, eight went on to found United Women&#x27;s Soccer (though the two Canadian teams were denied entry) and another seven joined the WPSL.

The revival of the W-League as the USL W League was announced on June 8, 2021, with eight founding teams due to begin play in 2022, none of which were revivals of teams from the original iteration of the W-League. Instead, many were associate with USL League One organizations.

==Teams==
127 unique teams participated in the W-League over the course of its history. Fifteen still existed (at varying levels of activity) as of 2019.

<text>Frithsden (locally pronounced &#x27;Frizden&#x27;) is a small hamlet in Hertfordshire, England. It sits in the Chiltern Hills, about two miles north of the town of Berkhamsted, which it&#x27;s part of. Administratively, it falls under the Dacorum district, specifically in the ward of Nettleden with Potten End.

The village name is derived from the wood &quot;le Fryth&quot; (me. frith »wood«). It is first mentioned 1291 as &quot;Frithesdene&quot; (»valley of the wood«).

West of the hamlet bordering to Ashridge Park are the Frithsden Beeches, a wood left to nature, with large beeches. Scenes for &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; have been filmed in this wood.

Frithsden, together with the neighbouring hamlets Nettleden and Potten End, is famous for its black cherries and the villagers hold in July their annual cherry fair. They also claim to have originated the Cherry Bounce and the Cherry Turnover. The village also had a winery, Frithsden Vineyard, but this closed in 2019.

<doc id="404615" wikidata="Q612939" url="?curid=404615" title="Fiji Labour Party">
<text>The Fiji Labour Party (FLP; ), also known as Fiji Labour, is a political party in Fiji. Most of its support is from the Indo-Fijian community, although it is officially multiracial and its first leader was an indigenous Fijian, Dr. Timoci Bavadra. The party has been elected to power twice, with Timoci Bavadra and Mahendra Chaudhry becoming prime minister in 1987 and 1999 respectively. On both occasions, the resulting government was rapidly overthrown by a coup.

== Formation of the Fiji Labour Party ==
By 1985, the people of Fiji were yearning for a third force in Fiji politics, as the opposition National Federation Party (NFP) was again falling apart and the right-wing policies of the ruling Alliance Party had alienated it from the ordinary people. Dissatisfaction with Government policies had begun soon after the 1982 elections with a prolonged teachers&#x27; strike and a hunger strike by young graduates, who were longer guaranteed employment. In industrial disputes, the government sided with the employers. In November 1984, when the Government announced a wage freeze, instead of calling a national strike, the largest trade union in Fiji, the Fiji Public Service Association (FPSA), decided, in March 1985 by a margin of 2914 votes to 326 votes, to &quot;associate itself with any organisation, in pursuance of workers&#x27; rights.&quot; The Fiji Labour Party was launched on 6 July 1985 under the auspices of the Fiji Trades Union Congress, at the Fiji Teachers Association hall in Suva.

== Initial electoral success ==
FLP faced its first electoral test in municipal elections held three months later, when it won control of the Suva City Council and its candidate, Bob Kumar, was elected Lord Mayor. It also won seats on the Labasa, Nadi, and Ba Town Councils, and subsequently secured a seat on the Lautoka City Council at a by-election.

FLP&#x27;s main test as a national political force came during the by-election for the North Central Indian National Seat in December 1985, following the resignation of Vijay R. Singh. FLP decided to field Mahendra Chaudhry, who was also the general secretary of the National Farmers Union as its candidate. The NFP candidate was former Alliance Minister, James Shankar Singh and the Alliance candidate was Uday Singh. Whereas both the Alliance and NFP again used race as an issue, Labour campaigned on policies. The result of the election was: Uday Singh, 7848 votes; Mahendra Chaudhry, 7644 votes and James Shankar Singh 5003 votes. Despite Chaudhry&#x27;s narrow loss, Labour was considered to have done well.

In June 1986, the NFP-elected MP Satendra Nandan joined the FLP. One month later, he was joined by Davendra Singh of the NFP Youth Wing, who had defeated the official NFP candidate in an earlier by-election, and Jay Raj Singh, another NFP-elected MP.

== Coalition with National Federation Party ==

=== Towards coalition with NFP ===
The narrow loss of the North Central by-election warned Labour of what awaited it in three-cornered elections in future. In September 1985, there had been talks between the NFP Youth Wing and Labour, but Labour had refused to accept group affiliation. In December 1985, the President of the Ba Branch of the NFP had called for a coalition between NFP and FLP, but the first meeting on talks regarding a coalition took place with Western United Front (WUF) delegates on 6 June 1986 where WUF MP, Isikeli Nadalo argued that, &quot;there should only be two political groups fighting the election.&quot; With the common aim of defeating the Alliance, a meeting between FLP, NFP and WUF was arranged for 26 June 1986.

=== Opposition to Coalition ===
Not all Labour supporters were happy with the idea of a coalition with NFP. USP lecturer, Dr Anirudh Singh, released the results of a survey, which demonstrated that Labour could win 26 seats on its own. The main concern for those who agreed with Dr Singh was that a coalition with NFP would destroy Labour&#x27;s multiracial image and undermine its efforts to win greater Fijian support. Dr Singh&#x27;s survey was designed to rally anti-coalition support at the first FLP convention in Lautoka in July 1986, but Krishna Dutt managed to persuade the convention to allow the Party&#x27;s Management Board &quot;a free hand to negotiate possible areas of cooperation that might serve the Party&#x27;s electoral strategy.&quot; The &quot;Fiji Sun&#x27;s&quot; political columnist wrote, &quot;The Party must choose between political expediency and clinging to the basic principles on which the Party was founded.&quot; Mahendra Sukhdeo, a Labour Suva City Councillor, resigned in protest and joined the Alliance.

=== Coalition formalised ===
Despite grassroots opposition, the Labour Party moved closer to coalition. On 10 October 1986, agreement was reached for a coalition with WUF. On 9 November 1986, the NFP appointed former opposition leader, Jai Ram Reddy, to negotiate the final pact with the FLP, and two days later the National Council of the FLP authorised the management board to finalise the coalition details.

== First Labour Government ==
The Fiji Labour Party formed its first government (in coalition with the National Federation Party) after elections in April 1987 gave the coalition 28 of the 52 parliamentary seats. Its election was overwhelmingly supported by Indo-Fijians, but resented by many ethnic Fijians, only 9% of whom had voted for the coalition. Strikes and demonstrations followed, and on 14 May the army seized power.

== 1987 to 2000 ==
Bavadra&#x27;s widow, Kuini (later Adi Kuini Speed) took the leadership of the party after her husband&#x27;s death in 1989, but was deposed in 1991 by Mahendra Chaudhry. She left the party in 1995, objecting to the direction in which Chaudhry was taking it. In the 1990s, the Labour Party lost most of its ethnic Fijian support, and the 1994 election showed that its support among Indo-Fijians was declining as well. It won only 7 seats that year.

In 1992, the party was admitted into the Socialist International as a consultative member.

== The People&#x27;s Coalition and the Coup of 2000 ==
The fortunes of the Labour Party revived in the later 1990s, as the government of Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka became unpopular amid admissions of womanising and reports of high-level corruption in his administration. In the election of 1999, the Labour Party swept to power, winning 37 seats in the 71-member House of Representatives, an absolute majority. A further 21 seats were won by its partners in the People&#x27;s Coalition. Chaudhry became Fiji&#x27;s first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister.

On 19 May 2000, Chaudhry&#x27;s government was overthrown in a putsch led by George Speight, a businessman whom the Labour government had fired from management of Fiji&#x27;s lucrative pine industry. The President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, dismissed the government on 27 May, intending to assume executive authority himself to confront the rebels, but his plan misfired when he was pressured into resigning two days later by the military commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama.

== Post-coup developments ==
Elections to restore democracy were held in September 2001. The Labour Party contested the election on a platform calling for an independent inquiry into the 2000 coup, and for compensation to be paid to its victims, including police officers and military personnel. The party also backed medical cover for all workers, and proposed removing Value Added Tax (VAT) from basic items; it had already instigated court proceedings to that effect. The party also proposed a five-year plan for economic recovery. Hurt by intra-party fighting and the defection of key figures including Tupeni Baba, however, the party won the most votes (34.8%), but only 28 of the 71 seats in the House of Representatives (Fiji), four fewer than the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) of Laisenia Qarase. The inability of the Labour Party and National Federation Party (NFP) (the only other political party with significant Indo-Fijian support) to reach a deal on exchanging &quot;preferences&quot; in Fiji&#x27;s transferable voting system, and the NFP&#x27;s decision to give its preferences to the SDL instead, probably cost Labour the election: despite their having been allies in the 1980s, the two parties have since become bitter enemies.

Since 2001, Mahendra Chaudhry had survived a leadership challenge and had rebuilt the Labour Party. Before 2006 it had won several key by-elections, and appeared well-placed to mount a credible challenge to the Qarase government in 2006. Chaudhry&#x27;s strained relationship with Prime Minister Qarase had prevented the Labour Party from being represented in the Cabinet, despite the constitutional stipulation that any political party with more than eight seats in the House of Representatives is entitled to proportionate representation in the Cabinet. On 18 July 2003, the Supreme Court of Fiji ruled that Qarase&#x27;s exclusion of the Labour Party breached the constitution, and demanded that the situation be rectified. Negotiations, appeals, and counter-appeals followed, which delayed the appointment of Labour Party ministers. In June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that the Labour Party was entitled to 14 out of 30 Cabinet posts. Qarase announced that he would accept and implement the order, but his refusal to include Chaudhry himself in any cabinet line-up continued to stall negotiations about the composition of the cabinet until Chaudhry announced towards the end of 2004 that the Labour Party was no longer interested in joining the government, and would remain in opposition for the remainder of the parliamentary term.

== 2005 municipal poll ==
On 7 July 2005, the Labour Party suspended all of its councillors on the Lautoka City Council, following a scandal in which councillors were found to have granted taxi bases to relatives and colleagues. Those suspended were the Deputy Mayor, Vijend Verma, Torika Ram, Aruna Devi, Atish Lekh Ram, Sunia Kunawave, Pravin Naidu, Hari Narayan, Divendra Chandra and Dhurup Chand. The last four submitted in their resignations from the Labour Party, saying they wanted nothing more to do with it. Naidu said he was resigning from the party in protest against the suspensions, which he said were a public relations ploy. The Labour Party was thought to be facing a stiff challenge to its control of the council in the municipal elections of 22 October and 13 November, from the new Sugar City Ratepayers Alliance, but in the end swept to a landslide victory, taking 12 of the 16 seats. The party also won a two-thirds majority in the Nasinu Town Council, but was heavily defeated in the poll for the Suva City Council.

== Towards 2006 ==
At its conference on 28 July 2005, the Labour Party approved a platform for the election due in 2006. The platform calls for strategies to be enacted to ensure annual economic growth of 6%, price reductions for basic food items, and incentives for indigenous landowners to develop and profit from their land. The party also advocates electoral reform, calling for the abolition or at least the reduction of Communal constituencies, which are reserved for candidates and electors enrolled as members of specific ethnic groups. On 21 November, FLP Parliamentarian Perumal Mupnar said that an FLP government would remove Value Added Tax (VAT) from all food items.

The FLP has been exploring coalition possibilities with other parties ahead of the election. Fiji&#x27;s instant run-off voting system, known locally as the alternative vote, allows votes for a low-polling candidate to be transferred to other candidates, following an order specified by the candidate, which may be customised by the individual voter. Most political parties are seeing coalition arrangements that will enable them to maximise their chances.

Deputy Leader Poseci Bune announced on 3 October that the FLP would attempt to broaden its appeal to indigenous Fijians by fielding more indigenous candidates than in previous elections. The final decision about what seats to contest would be made after the conclusion of negotiations with potential coalition partners, such as the NAPF and the UPP. On 10 October, Mahendra Chaudhry announced that 222 applications had been received for the 71 parliamentary constituencies, many of them indigenous. He was not surprised, he said, by the increasing interest shown by indigenous Fijians, whom he described as &quot;frustrated&quot; with the SDL government. He also welcomed what he said was a good number of prospective female candidates, saying that more women were needed in an area that was dominated by men.

FLP secretary and parliamentarian Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi announced on 9 January 2006 that the party would contest the forthcoming elections on a platform of completing the program it had begun in 1999–2000.

=== Negotiations with the NFP ===
On 18 August 2005, officials of the FLP and the National Federation Party (NFP) held what they described as a &quot;courtesy call&quot;. Preferential voting was among the topics discussed, but no serious negotiations were entered into, with both parties indicating that such a move would be premature. Several major news services reported in early September, however, that the two parties were close to reaching a deal. Comments by FLP officials led credence to these rumours, but on 7 September, the NFP President, Raman Pratap Singh, denied that any such agreement was imminent, stating that the NFP had held no talks with FLP officials on any cooperative arrangements. NFP secretary Pramod Rae thought likewise: &quot;We are open to discussion,&quot; he said. &quot;But at this stage there is nothing. We will have to see what their party policies are, if they are similar then we will share preferences.&quot; On 3 October, however, Rae said that although a final decision had not been made, sentiment within the NFP was leaning towards contesting the 2006 election alone, rather than aligning itself with either the FLP or the ruling SDL.

Chaundry claimed on 19 October that NFP officials were unwilling to meet their FLP counterparts, and that the FLP would therefore concentrate on trying to maximise its own vote in the first count, rather than rely on votes transferred from other parties. Then, on 4 November, he rebuffed what he said was an NFP overture to exchange preferences in seven safe Indian communal constituencies. Speaking at three sugar cane farming settlements in Ba Province, he said that what the NFP really wanted was for the FLP to give them those seven seats, all of which were then held by the FLP. &quot;They want something for nothing and their proposal is simply not on,&quot; Chaudhry said. However, NFP assistant general secretary Kamal Iyer denied that his party had presented any such proposal to the FLP, or to any party for that matter.

The FLP announced on 13 February 2006 that it would put aside its differences with the NFP provided that the NFP would do likewise. The NFP rejected the offer, calling it a deliberate tactic designed to mislead the supporters of both parties, Fiji Television reported. The NFP strongly denied Chaudhry&#x27;s claim that the NFP leader failed to appear at a scheduled meeting in late 2005.

A meeting between representatives of the two parties took place in the last week of February 2006. Conflicting media reports followed on whether the talks had proved fruitful or whether they had ended in deadlock.

=== Chinese Communist Party ===
In 2005, the FLP signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese Communist Party, a move which was criticised by the National Federation Party.

=== Negotiations with NAPF, UPP ===
The FLP also attempted to negotiate coalition preferences with the National Alliance Party (NAPF) and the United Peoples Party. UPP leader Mick Beddoes was hopeful, but cautioned that his party would not accept any deal that was not favourable to UPP candidates. On 7 October, however, he revealed that the UPP and the FLP were close to finalising a draft agreement for consideration, and on 16 October he announced that the UPP executive had approved an electoral pact with the FLP the day before. &quot;We share similar positions on issues of unemployment, poverty alleviation, health and other areas. It is also based on our belief in the rights of all our citizens and their need for equality under the law,&quot; Beddoes said, explaining his agreement with the FLP. On 2 December, the two parties signed a memorandum of understanding, agreeing to draw up a joint manifesto and to share preferences at the 2006 election. The agreement left both parties free to contest any or all of the 71 parliamentary seats, or to field joint candidates by mutual agreement. It also left open the possibility of other parties joining the coalition.

On 22 February 2006, the FLP and its UPP and Party of National Unity (PANU) allies announced that the UPP&#x27;s Mick Beddoes had been chosen to lead the negotiations with other parties, such as the NAPF and the NFP, concerning coalitions or preference deals.

On 13 March, FLP Parliamentarian Krishna Datt and NAPF President Ratu Epeli Ganilau both denied reports that their respective parties had agreed on Cabinet allocations in a coalition government. A secret agreement had allegedly provided for Ganilau to become Prime Minister, Chaudhry Minister for Finance, and FLP Deputy Leader Poseci Bune Foreign Minister. Discussions were ongoing, they said, and no agreement had been made.

===Election result===
In the 2006 Fijian general election, the FLP contested 59 seats in the 71-member House of Representatives. The party won 39% of the popular vote and 31 seats. Almost 80% of the Indo-Fijian community voted for the FLP, which won all 19 seats allocated to Indo-Fijians.

==2006 coup and aftermath==
The FLP initially supported the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état, after party president Jokapeci Koroi announced support for a military takeover on national television in January 2006. Chaudhry served in the interim regime, holding the portfolios of Finance, Sugar Reform and National Planning, with Assistant secretary-general Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi and management board member Tom Ricketts holding other portfolios. As a result, the party was expelled from the Socialist International at its 23rd congress.

In August 2008, the FLP left the interim government, ostensibly to prepare for elections. Chaudhry subsequently became a critic of the regime and was arrested for breaching emergency laws.

In January 2013, the military regime promulgated new regulations governing the registration of political parties, requiring all parties to have at least 5,000 members. The FLP applied for registration on 15 February, becoming one of only two parties to do so. Registration was granted on 3 May 2013.

==2014–present==
The FLP contested the general elections held in September 2014. The military-backed interim government did not permit Chaudhry to be a candidate and prohibited him from campaigning in the first election since the 2006 coup, although he was still the Fiji Labour Party leader. The results gave the party only 2.4 percent of the vote and no parliamentary seats, while interim Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama&#x27;s Fiji First Party took 59.2 percent of the vote and 32 of the 50 seats. Chaudhry joined the leaders of other opposition parties in alleging electoral fraud.

On 3 July 2015, Chaudhry was quoted by Radio New Zealand as announcing his retirement from the leadership of the FLP, having served in that capacity for 23 years. The next day, however, he denied having made such a statement.

===2018 election===
In October 2018 the FLP signed a partnership agreement with the Freedom Alliance to join forces for the 2018 election. The party submitted a joint list of 25 candidates, including 6 women. However, it failed to win any seats, winning only 2,800 votes.

===2022 election===
In the 2022 election the FLP managed to increase significantly its vote share, obtaining a better result than in both the 2014 and 2018 elections, but failed again to get any parliamentary representation.

<text>Gutterflower is the seventh studio album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls. It was released in 2002 on Warner Bros. Records. It is the follow-up to their critically successful albums &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot; and &quot;A Boy Named Goo&quot;. The album was commercially successful upon its release, hitting No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their highest position on the chart.

== Track listing ==
==Singles==
&quot;Here Is Gone&quot; and &quot;Big Machine&quot; have been the only two songs released from this album as singles and videos have been created for both. A video for the promotional single &quot;Sympathy&quot; was also released.
===&quot;Big Machine&quot;===
John Rzeznik refers to this as his &quot;disco song&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m really horrible at programming drum machines, but this was like pattern 74 on my drum machine, which said &#x27;disco.&#x27; I called all my friends and said, &#x27;Check this out, this is my disco song!&#x27;&quot; He describes it as &quot;a propulsive tale of unrequited love&quot;. &quot;Big Machine&quot; was occasionally performed live on a smashed Stratocaster guitar that Rzeznik has fondly nicknamed &quot;The Half-Caster&quot;. Despite being smashed in half, it still plays. It can be seen in a 2002 VH1 Storytellers special. Rzeznik stated that he had someone fix it up and it works just fine.

===&quot;Here Is Gone&quot;===
John Rzeznik wrote this song on the phone while talking to a friend. He asked his friend if he should &quot;take the chords up or take &#x27;em down?&quot; and the friend told him to &quot;take &#x27;em up&quot; and that&#x27;s how he came up with the chorus and the rest of the song came together shortly thereafter.

According to Rzeznik in 2007, the video for this song cost more to produce than the entire Gutterflower album itself.

==Reception==
* Upon release, &quot;Gutterflower&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. In fact, although The Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; multi-platinum album &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot; (which was &quot;Gutterflower&#x27;s&quot; predecessor) sold around 3,000,000 more albums than &quot;Gutterflower&quot;, reviews were equally positive.
* In 2005, &quot;Gutterflower&quot; was ranked number 499 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Personnel==
*Johnny Rzeznik – guitar, lead vocals
*Robby Takac – bass, background vocals, lead vocals on &quot;Smash&quot;, &quot;Tucked Away&quot;, &quot;You Never Know&quot; and &quot;Up, Up, Up&quot;
*Mike Malinin – drums, percussion

<text>Prior to the 2006 coup d&#x27;état, Fiji had a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party had a chance of gaining power alone, forcing parties to work with each other to form coalition governments.

In January 2013 the military regime promulgated new regulations governing the registration of political parties. Parties are required to have 5,000 financial members, obey a code of conduct, and be named in the English language. The existing 16 registered parties were required to re-register under the new rules, but only two – the Fiji Labour Party and the National Federation Party – did so. The rest were dissolved on 15 February 2013 and their assets forfeited to the government.

==Current parties==

<text>The United Fiji Party (, , SDL) was a political party in Fiji. It was founded in 2001 by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase as a power base; it absorbed most of the Christian Democratic Alliance and other conservative groups, and its endorsement by the Great Council of Chiefs &quot;(Bose Levu Vakaturaga)&quot; caused it to be widely seen as the successor to the Alliance Party, the former ruling party that had dominated Fijian politics from the 1960s to the 1980s. It drew its support mainly from indigenous Fijiians.

The party was led in Parliament by Prime Minister Qarase. The party organization was headed up by Ratu Kalokalo Loki as President and by Jale Baba as General Secretary (later termed National Director) until early 2006, when he was transferred at the beginning of 2006 to managing the campaign for the 2006 General Election. Peceli Kinivuwai took over as National Director.

== History ==
From the time of its inception, the SDL stood for the economic and social advancement of all Fiji citizens. There was a strong focus however on reducing the economic gap between the different ethnic communities, which continued to be a controversial issue for many commentators who accused the SDL of blatant racism. It also called for a consolidation of the rule of law and claims to support an independent judiciary.

The SDL contested 59 of the 71 parliamentary seats in the 2001 elections; this figure included only 7 of the 19 seats reserved for Indo-Fijians. It received 26 percent of the vote, well short of the 32 percent polled by the Fiji Labour Party, but helped by preference deals with other ethnic Fijian-dominated parties as well as the Indo-Fijian-led National Federation Party, it became the largest party in Parliament, with 32 out of 71 seats. It subsequently formed a coalition with the Conservative Alliance.

After the 2006 Military Coup, SDL retained its Party Headquarters Office at 66 Mcgregor Rd, Suva. The Party Leadership structure remained intact amidst the political situation, Laisenia Qarase continued to be the Party Leader, Solomoni Naivalu - President, Ro Dona Takalaiyale - Vice President, Ro Teimumu Kepa - Patron. Peceli Kinivuawai remained National Director until he left for Australia and got a Protection Visa where Samisoni Tikoinasau took over until he also had to leave for Australia on a Protection Visa.

Mataiasi Ragiagia took over as Party General Secretary, assisted by the senior executives who were responsible for the administrative and daily organisational affairs of the party.

At its annual conference on 27 May 2005, the SDL strongly endorsed Prime Minister Qarase&#x27;s controversial proposals to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission with powers, subject to presidential approval, to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the coup d&#x27;état that deposed the elected government in 2000. It agreed, however, to listen to objections. At the same conference, Qarase publicly welcomed what he claimed was an increase in the number of Indo-Fijians joining the SDL, evidence, he said, that the SDL was the multiracial party it had always claimed to be.

=== 2005 municipal election ===

The SDL contested many of the mayoral and council positions throughout Fiji in the municipal elections scheduled for 22 October 2005. In many towns, the SDL was aligned with the National Federation Party (NFP), but in Suva, the two parties feuded over what the NFP claimed was a breach of a memorandum of understanding between the two parties after the previous municipal elections, held in 2002. According to the NFP, the agreement specified that each party would hold the Mayoralty of Suva for one year, with the two parties jointly choosing the Lord Mayor in the third year. The NFP accuses the SDL of having broken the agreement by forging a coalition in 2004 with the Fiji Labour Party to retain the Mayoralty. SDL Secretary Jale Baba denied on 19 October 2005 that his party had breached the agreement, saying that Umaria was putting his own spin on it; there was no agreement on sharing the Mayoralty in the third year, Baba said. The election was a bittersweet experience for the SDL; they gained a majority in their own right in Suva, but lost control of Nasinu, Fiji&#x27;s largest municipality.

=== 2006 parliamentary election ===
The SDL appointed former Fiji Development Bank Chairman Navitalai Naisoro to head a panel interviewing would-be parliamentary candidates for the SDL. The interviews began in the last week of August 2005. The party&#x27;s general secretary, Jale Baba, had earlier said that the SDL was dissatisfied with the performance of about a third of its parliamentarians, and that they would not be nominated for another term. Names approved by the panel will be forwarded to the selection committee of the appropriate constituency, before a decision is finalized. On 27 February 2006, Baba, no longer general secretary but now coordinator of the election campaign, said that the selection process had begun and would take two to three weeks.

=== Indian candidates ===
On 12 August 2005, Baba claimed that three members of the opposition Fiji Labour Party&#x27;s parliamentary caucus had applied for endorsement as SDL candidates for the parliamentary election scheduled to be held in mid-2006. He refused to name them, saying that to do so could prematurely end their political careers. The three were interviewed at 5am on an unrevealed date in early September to protect their identities, SDL President Ratu Kalokalo Loki said. The Fiji Live news service reported on 7 September that it had information that not three, but five, FLP members were interviewed.

SDL National Director Jale Baba announced on 11 September 2005 that the party would contest all 71 parliamentary seats in the 2006 election. Indo-Fijian candidates would be nominated for open constituencies as well as communal constituencies reserved for Indo-Fijians. Baba said that byelections showed that Indo-Fijian support for the SDL had increased since 2001, when it hardly registered, and that the party was confident of winning most of the seats in 2006. On 2 October, Baba said that members of all ethnic communities, including Indo-Fijians, had applied for nomination, which he described as &quot;a major change&quot; for a party hitherto dominated by indigenous Fijians.

Baba announced On 4 January 2006 that 43 Indo-Fijians had been shortlisted. Their names had been forwarded to the party&#x27;s constituency councils which would finalize nominations in due course. The SDL was not an exclusively indigenous party, he emphasized. &quot;We look after the interests of all. We are strongly pro-Fijian but not exclusive. We do not restrict membership to other communities. Programs are there for everyone.&quot;

Prime Minister Qarase reiterated on 23 January 2006 that the party intended to contest all 71 seats.

FLP parliamentarian Poseci Bune challenged the FLP on 3 February 2006 to substantiate its assertion that three FLP caucus members had applied to contest the upcoming election on the SDL ticket. The claim was untrue and just a campaign gimmick, Bune alleged. Baba did not reply to the challenge, but announced on 20 February that two more FLP defectors had joined the three seeking SDL endorsement. Citing confidentiality rules, Baba refused to name them, but said they were all Indo-Fijians, bringing to 48 the number of ethnic Indians who would stand in the primary elections to choose SDL candidates in the third week of February. All told, 321 sought nomination for the 71 constituencies.

The SDL launched an Indian wing on 23 March 2006. Seventy supporters attended the public launch at Namaka, Nadi, with Ratu Suliano Matanitobua, a Cabinet Minister and &quot;Tui Namosi&quot; (Paramount Chief of Namosi) as the chief speaker. Matanitobua praised the Indo-Fijian contribution to Fiji, and asked them to support the SDL to move Fiji forward.

=== Retiring parliamentarians ===
Party Secretary Jale Baba said on 20 September that three SDL members of the present Cabinet had not sought the SDL nomination for the 2006 election. He declined to identify the Ministers involved, but said they were stepping down for a variety of reasons. On 2 February 2006, Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola revealed that he was one who would not be seeking reelection.

=== Negotiations with NFP ===
Prime Minister Qarase also announced on 11 September that the SDL would attempt to negotiate preference deals with the National Federation Party (NFP) and the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) ahead of the 2006 election. He considered that parties dominated by the two respective principal races in the country needed each other&#x27;s &quot;preferences&quot; under Fiji&#x27;s so-called alternative vote system, which allows votes cast for low-polling candidates to be transferred to higher-polling candidates, as specified by the eliminated candidate.

The NFP said in August 2005 that it would withhold its preferences from the SDL unless it withdrew its controversial Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill, but Qarase expressed the hope that &quot;good sense&quot; would prevail. Aiming to establish a commission with the power to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the 2000 coup, the legislation has been branded by opponents as a thinly-veiled legal mechanism for freeing supporters of the present government, who have been convicted and imprisoned on coup-related charges. In September, however, the NFP appeared to adopt a somewhat more flexible position.

In the end, the NFP decided to give its preferences to the SDL in some constituencies, but not all. Prime Minister Qarase said that the NFP decision to give its preferences to the opposition Fiji Labour Party (FLP) in a number of marginal electorates was a breach of promise, and withdrew his own earlier offer to include the NFP in his post-election Cabinet.

=== Grand Coalition ===
On 30 July 2005, the SDL joined the Grand Coalition Initiative Group, an electoral alliance of predominantly indigenous Fijian parties that agreed to share preferences in the 2006 election. On 25 November, Prime Minister Qarase confirmed that the SDL would definitely share cooperate with members of the coalition, including the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), and that he was having talks with SVT President Sitiveni Rabuka about sharing preferences.

=== Merger with CAMV ===
Prime Minister Qarase announced on 16 February 2006 that the Conservative Alliance (CAMV), the coalition partner of Qarase&#x27;s SDL, would be formalizing a decision the next day to deregister itself in order to merge with the SDL.

===Election result===
In the election, held on 6–13 May, the SDL won 44 percent of the popular vote (including 81 percent of the ethnic Fijian vote), and 36 out of 71 seats. All 23 Communal Constituencies allocated to indigenous Fijians were won by the SDL, most of them overwhelmingly; the party also won 13 of the 25 Open Constituencies elected by universal suffrage. The SDL failed to make any significant inroads into the Indo-Fijian community, polling barely 2 percent of the Indo-Fijian vote, and also lost the one minority voters&#x27; constituency it had held.

The SDL-led government was ousted in the military coup of December 2006 - the first coup in Fiji to overthrow an SDL government rather than an FLP one.

===Dissolution===
In January 2013 the Fijian regime announced new political party registration rules which would require all parties to register their names in English. In response the party reformed as the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA).

<text>Fulmer is a village and civil parish in south Buckinghamshire, England. The village has, along most of its northern border, a narrow green buffer from Gerrards Cross and its heavily wooded adjoining neighbouring villages of Iver Heath and Wexham. The village&#x27;s name is derived from the Old English for &quot;mere or lake frequented by birds&quot;. It was recorded in 1198 as &quot;Fugelmere&quot;.

In the late 17th century the owners of the manor of Fulmer were forced to sell their house to their servants because they had squandered their money and could not afford to pay them. The manor then passed into the hands of the Duke of Portland.

In the mid-19th century watercress was grown at Moor Farm, known locally as &quot;The Bog&quot;, (now Low Farm) by Richard Whiting Bradbery, the son of William Bradbery, the first British watercress pioneer who had a large cress farm at West Hyde, Hertfordshire. Richard is buried in St James churchyard, Fulmer, with his wife Hannah.

Fulmer Chase on Stoke Common Road is a former home of the Wills tobacco family and was used as a military hospital during World War II.

Fulmer is close to Pinewood Studios and several films have been shot in the village, including &quot;Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines&quot; and &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;.

==Demography==
==Education==

Fulmer Infant School is in Fulmer.

Teikyo School United Kingdom is in the area.

==Sport and recreation==
King George&#x27;s Field is a playing field that was named in memorial to King George V.

Fulmer Cricket Club play friendly matches at King George&#x27;s Field. A local village team has existed since 1886 but the current club was officially founded in 1895. Local resident and noted cricketer Denis Compton opened the new clubhouse in 1988.

<text>The Hungarian Socialist Party (, ), commonly known by its acronym MSZP (), is a centre-left to left-wing social-democratic and pro-European political party in Hungary.

It was founded on 7 October, 1989 as a post-communist evolution and one of two legal successors of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSZMP). Along with its conservative rival Fidesz, MSZP was one of the two most dominant parties in Hungarian politics until 2010; however, the party lost much of its popular support as a result of the Őszöd speech, the consequent 2006 protests, and then the 2008 financial crisis. Following the 2010 election, MSZP became the largest opposition party in parliament, a position it held until 2018, when it was overtaken by the former far and now centre-right Jobbik.

==History==

The MSZP evolved from the communist Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (or MSZMP), which ruled Hungary between 1956 and 1989. By the summer of 1989, the MSZMP was no longer a Marxist–Leninist party, and had been taken over by a faction of radical reformers who favoured jettisoning the Communist system in favour of a market economy. One of its leaders, Rezső Nyers, the architect of the New Economic Mechanism in the 1960s and 1970s, was elected as chairman of a four-man collective presidency that replaced the old MSZMP Politburo. Although General Secretary Károly Grósz, who had succeeded longtime leader János Kádár a year earlier, was elected to this body, Nyers now outranked him–and was thus now the de facto leader of Hungary.

At a party congress on 7 October 1989, the MSZMP dissolved and refounded itself as the MSZP, with Nyers as its first president. A marginal &quot;Communist&quot; faction led by Grósz broke away to form a revived Hungarian Communist Workers&#x27; Party, now known as the Hungarian Workers&#x27; Party, the other successor of the MSZMP.

The decision to declare the MSZP a successor of the MSZMP was controversial, and still carries repercussions for both the MSZP and Hungary. Another source of controversy is that some members of the former communist elite maintained political influence in the MSZP. Indeed, many key MSZP politicians were active members or held leadership positions within the MSZMP (like Gyula Horn and László Kovács).

On economic issues, the Socialists have often been greater advocates of liberal, free market policies than the conservative opposition, which has tended to favor more state interventionism in the economy through economic and price regulations, as well as through state ownership of key economic enterprises. The MSZP, in contrast, implemented a strong package of market reforms, austerity and privatization in 1995–96, called the Bokros package, when Hungary faced an economic and financial crisis. According to researchers, the elites of the Hungarian &#x27;left&#x27; (MSZP and SZDSZ) have been differentiated from the &#x27;right&#x27; by being more supportive of the classical neo-liberal economic policies, while the &#x27;right&#x27; (especially extreme right) has advocated more interventionist policies. In contrast, issues like church and state and former communists show alignment along the traditional left-right spectrum. It is also noteworthy that, according to research, the MSZP elite&#x27;s positions used to be closer to voters of the SZDSZ than to their own.

Besides a more liberal approach to the economy overall, the MSZP differentiated itself from the conservative opposition through its more recent focus on transforming state social policy from a collection of measures that benefit the entire population, such as subsidies available to all citizens, to one based on financial and social need.

Besides Gyula Horn, the MSZP&#x27;s most internationally recognized politicians were Ferenc Gyurcsány and László Kovács, a former member of the European Commission, responsible for taxation.

==Electoral history==
The MSZP faced the voters for the first time at the 1990 elections, the first free elections held in Hungary in 44 years. It was knocked down to fourth place with only 33 seats.

Nyers handed the leadership to Horn, Hungary&#x27;s last Communist foreign minister. Horn led the MSZP to an outright majority at the 1994 parliamentary election. Although the MSZP could have governed alone, he opted to form a coalition with the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). He not only wanted to allay concerns inside and outside Hungary of a former Communist party holding a majority, but needed the Free Democrats&#x27; votes to get economic reforms (what became the Bokros package) past his own party&#x27;s left wing. Thus the MSZP was released from a so-called &quot;political quarantine&quot; imposed by the other Hungarian parties; during the first five years after the change of system, the other parties cooperated to shut out the MSZP from decision-making.

After being turned out of office in 1998, the party was able to form a renewed centre-left coalition with the Free Democrats in 2002.

At the 2006 elections, MSZP won with 43.2% of party list votes, which gave it 190 representatives out of 386 in the Parliament. The MSZP was therefore able to retain its coalition government from the previous term. In earlier elections, the MSZP polled 10.89% (1990), 32.98% (1994), 32.92% (1998) and 42.05% (2002).

After the successful fees abolishment referendum, MSZP formed the first minority government of Hungary, following the SZDSZ&#x27;s backing out of the coalition with a deadline of 1 May 2008.

===2010s decline===
On 21 March 2009 Gyurcsány announced his resignation as Prime Minister due to failure management of the economic crisis. Gordon Bajnai became the nominee of MSZP for the post of prime minister in March 2009 and he became Prime Minister on 14 April. Gyurcsány also resigned from his position of party chairman, which he had occupied since 2007.

MSZP lost half of its supporters during the European Parliament election in 2009, receiving only 17.37% of the votes and gaining four seats compared to the previous nine seats. This electoral defeat marked the end of the &quot;de facto&quot; two-party system in Hungary, which had lasted since 1998.

The Hungarian Socialist Party suffered a heavy defeat in the 2010 election (won by Fidesz with a ⅔ majority), gaining only 19.3% of the votes, and 59 seats in the parliament. Following the resignation of Ildikó Lendvai, the party&#x27;s prime minister candidate Attila Mesterházy was elected Chairman of the Socialist Party. Nevertheless, MSZP became the biggest opposition party in Hungary.

The left-wing fragmented after the 2010 election; at first Katalin Szili left the MSZP to form Social Union (SZU), following the similarly significant defeated local elections in October 2010, nevertheless Gyurcsány&#x27;s detachment was a much worse disaster for the Socialists. Initially, the former PM wanted to reform the party, but his goals remained in the minority. As a result, Gyurcsány, along with nine other members of the parliamentary group, left MSZP and established Democratic Coalition (DK). Thus MSZP&#x27;s number of MPs reduced to 48.

The Socialist Party entered into an alliance with four other parties in January 2014 to contest the April parliamentary election. Mesterházy was elected candidate for the Prime Minister position, but the Unity alliance failed to win. After that the electoral coalition disestablished. On the 2014 European Parliament election, MSZP suffered the largest defeat since the 1990 parliamentary election, gaining third place and only 10% of the votes. After the obvious failure, Mesterházy and the entire presidium of the Socialist Party resigned.

József Tóbiás was elected leader of the Socialist Party on 19 July 2014 following the resignation of Mesterházy. He also became leader of the parliamentary group in September 2014. During his leadership, the Socialist Party won a parliamentary by-election (2014) and an important mayoral by-election (Salgótarján), however the party itself was permanently pushed back to the third place by far-right Jobbik according to the opinion polls. Tóbiás did not support the full cooperation and unification of the left-wing opposition parties against Viktor Orbán. During the MSZP party congress in June 2016, he was defeated by Gyula Molnár, a former Socialist MP and mayor, who succeeded him as party chairman. In February 2016, the party decided to sell its headquarters at Jókai Street for financial reasons. In June 2018, Bertalan Tóth was elected president in the MSZP, shortly after the party suffered its worst electoral defeat since 1990.

The party further declined in the 2019 European election, only scoring 6.61% of votes (even in alliance with Dialogue for Hungary) and being overtaken by the Democratic Coalition and Momentum. In 2019 local elections the party managed (due to cooperation with other parties) to win mayorships ir Érd and Szombathely. Also in these elections MSZP managed to win mayorships in those areas, where it never had a mayor since 1990 (e. g. Mohács).

The 2019 local election results caused resignations from the party on the local level (e. g. Szeged mayor Laszlo Botka).

In 2020, the party&#x27;s congress supported a change to the party&#x27;s structure. Instead of having one leader, the party would nominate two co-leaders – a man and woman (similar structure has been implemented in 2019 by the Social Democratic Party of Germany).

== Ideology ==
In political terms, the MSZP differentiates itself from its conservative opponents mainly in its rejection of Hungarian nationalism. The party is a member of the Progressive Alliance, the Socialist International, and the Party of European Socialists (PES), and it holds a chairmanship and several vice-chairmanships in committees at the European Parliament. The MSZP is a centre-left to left-wing party, but it has historically been centrist.

==Election results==

=== National Assembly ===

====Single Member Constituencies voting consistently for MSZP====

The image shows Single Member Constituencies (or SMCs) voting for MSZP in 1998, 2002, 2006 in dark red, while showing SMCs voting for MSZP in 2002 and 2006 in red. The dark red districts are considered the strongest positions of the party. Most if not all districts shown in dark red and red also voted for MSZP in 1994, a landslide victory for the party. So actually, dark red districts have an even longer uninterrupted voting history of supporting MSZP.

<text>The Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (, , MSZMP) was the ruling Marxist–Leninist party of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic between 1956 and 1989. It was organised from elements of the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, with János Kádár as general secretary. The party also controlled its armed forces, the Hungarian People&#x27;s Army.

Like all other Eastern Bloc parties, the MSZMP was organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Vladimir Lenin that entails democratic and open discussion of issues within the party followed by the requirement of total unity in upholding the agreed policies. The highest body within the MSZMP was the party Congress, which convened every five years. When the Congress was not in session, the Central Committee of the MSZMP was the highest body. Because the Central Committee met twice a year, most day-to-day duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo. The party leader was the de facto chairman of the Politburo and a de facto chief executive of Hungary. At various points he served as the prime minister in addition to being party leader.

==Overview==
János Kádár announced the formation of the party via radio on 1 November 1956. The party supported the revolution, but turned against Imre Nagy&#x27;s government after he denounced the Warsaw Pact. The party formed a &#x27;Revolutionary Peasant-Worker Government&#x27; that took over the country, with Soviet support, on 4 November 1956.

Gradually, however, the new government instituted goulash Communism, a somewhat more humane way of governing than had prevailed under Mátyás Rákosi. Under Kádár&#x27;s mantra of &quot;he who is not against us is with us,&quot; Hungarians generally had more freedom than their Eastern Bloc counterparts to go about their daily lives. For example, his government executed only 350 people after the 1956 revolution. The government also gave limited freedom to the workings of the market via the New Economic Mechanism. However, it retained a monopoly of political power, and subjected the media to censorship that was fairly onerous by Western standards. The National Assembly, like its counterparts in the rest of the Soviet bloc, continued to rubber-stamp decisions already made by the MSZMP leadership. It was the dominant component of the Patriotic People&#x27;s Front, a popular front that included some non-Communists. However, all prospective candidates had to accept the Front&#x27;s program in order to stand. Indeed, Kádár and his close advisers used the Front to weed out candidates they deemed unacceptable.

Kádár retired on 22 May 1988 and was succeeded by Prime Minister Károly Grósz. However, Grósz soon found himself eclipsed by a group of radical reformers who favored establishing a market economy. On 28 January 1989, young Politburo member and minister of state Imre Pozsgay announced during an interview with the radio program 168 Hours that the Poliburo&#x27;s historical sub-committee regarded the events of 1956 as a &#x27;people&#x27;s uprising&#x27;. This announcement, not approved in advance by the Politburo, provoked and catalyzed various developments within the party, and brought about sudden and ever-escalating changes that, within nine months, resulted in the ending of Communism in Hungary and the dissolution of the MSZMP.

By the summer of 1989, the MSZMP was no longer a Marxist–Leninist party, and the radical reformers, led by Prime Minister Miklós Németh, Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, Rezső Nyers, and Pozsgay, had taken over the party machinery. On 26 June 1989, the Central Committee was renamed the Political Executive Committee, and the Politburo was replaced by a four-man collective presidency chaired by Nyers. Although Grósz remained general secretary, Nyers now outranked him. On 7 October 1989 the MSZMP was dissolved and refounded as the Hungarian Socialist Party, a Western-style social democratic party. Two weeks later, the National Assembly approved numerous amendments to the constitution that purged it of its Marxist–Leninist character, ending one-party rule in Hungary.

A small Communist faction, centred on Károly Grósz, opposed these reforms and broke away to form the Hungarian Communist Workers&#x27; Party on 17 December 1989.

<text>The Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party (, , abbr. MDP) was the ruling communist party of Hungary from 1948 to 1956.

It was formed by a merger of the Hungarian Communist Party (MKP) and the Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP). Ostensibly a union of equals, the merger had actually occurred as a result of massive pressure brought to bear on the Social Democrats by both the Hungarian Communists, as well as the Soviet Union. The few independent-minded Social Democrats who had not been sidelined by Communist salami tactics were pushed out in short order after the merger, leaving the party as essentially the MKP under a new name. 

Other minor legal Hungarian political parties were allowed to continue as independent coalition parties until late 1949 but were completely subservient to the MDP.

Its leader was Mátyás Rákosi until 1956, then Ernő Gerő in the same year for three months, and eventually János Kádár until the party&#x27;s dissolution.

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the party was reorganized into the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSZMP) by a circle of communists around Kádár and Imre Nagy. The new government of Nagy declared to assess the uprising not as counter-revolutionary but as a &quot;great, national and democratic event&quot; and to dissolve State Security Police (ÁVH). Hungary&#x27;s declaration to become neutral and to exit the Warsaw Pact caused the second Soviet intervention on 4 November 1956. After 8 November 1956, the MSZMP, under Kádár&#x27;s leadership, fully supported the Soviet Union.

<text>Milford is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States, on the Souhegan River. The population was 16,131 at the 2020 census, up from 15,115 at the 2010 census. It is the retail and manufacturing center of a multi-town area known informally as the Souhegan Valley.

The town center, where 9,212 people lived at the 2020 census, is defined as the Milford census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of New Hampshire routes 13 and 101A.

== History ==
Milford separated from neighboring Amherst in 1794. Like most towns named Milford in the United States, its name comes from the fact that it grew around a mill built on a ford—in this case on the Souhegan River.

Milford was once home to numerous granite quarries, which produced a stone that was used, among other things, to make the pillars for the U.S. Treasury in Washington, D.C.—pillars that can be seen on the back of the American $10 bill. Its nickname remains &quot;The Granite Town&quot;, although only one small quarry is in operation as of 2017.

Like many New England riverside towns, Milford developed several thriving textile mills in the 19th century. That industry left New England by World War II, but Milford remains the commercial and retail center for surrounding towns. Major employers included casting company Hitchiner Manufacturing Co., a metal cable manufacturer, Hendrix Wire and Cable Inc., and a contract manufacturing solutions company, Cirtronics Corporation. In 2018, local firm Alene Candles became one of the first companies in the state to implement a &quot;conscious leadership&quot; program in a manufacturing production setting.

Milford is home to the Milford State Fish Hatchery. The town also holds the Souhegan Valley Boys &amp; Girls Club, built on the former home of the now-bankrupt private theater American Stage Festival.

Milford was a stop on the Underground Railroad for escaped slaves. It was also the home of Harriet E. Wilson, who published the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Our Nig: Or, Sketches in the Life of a Free Black&quot; in 1859, making it the first novel by an African-American woman published in the country.

Officially designated &quot;Union Square&quot;, the Milford Oval is neither square nor oval in shape, but rather triangular. The &quot;square&quot; name in American parlance denotes a town common irrespective of geometry, and the &quot;oval&quot; name dates from the 19th century, when it was oval in shape. The Oval is the town center, with the Pillsbury Bandstand as its centerpiece and the Souhegan River as the backdrop. The Oval is formed by a modified traffic rotary in which State Highways 13 and 101A intersect, with northbound 13 and eastbound 101A passing straight through and crossing each other at a right angle with a stop sign for traffic on Route 13.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.22% of the town. Milford is drained by the Souhegan River, an eastward-flowing tributary of the Merrimack River. The southwestern part of town is drained by Mitchell Brook and Spaulding Brook, which flow south into Brookline and are part of the Nashua River watershed, another tributary of the Merrimack. The town&#x27;s highest point is near its western border, on the summit of Boynton Hill, at above sea level.

<text>Gawcott is a village about southwest of Buckingham in the Buckinghamshire district in the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, England. The village is in the civil parish of Gawcott with Lenborough.

==History==
The toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;cottage for which rent is payable&quot;. The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 records the village as &quot;Chauescote&quot;. An alternative description for the name of Gawcott, however, comes from the old Norse word for the cuckoo, &#x27;Gaukr&#x27;, pronounced Gawk and &#x27;cott&#x27; for house/ home/ cottage. 

This explanation has some merit as in the west of the village the cuckoo was the prevalent bird up until the early 1940s when much of its habitat was destroyed to make space for servicemen in the Second World War. One of the local historic public houses of the village was also named the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest.

Sir George Gilbert Scott, the architect of the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras railway station in London (and numerous other buildings), was born in Gawcott where his father, the Reverend Thomas Scott (1780–1835), was perpetual curate.

==Signal Hill==
To the east of the village is Signal Hill, which was a former FCO/MI6 signals intelligence station.

<text>Gayhurst is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is about NNW of Newport Pagnell, and north of Central Milton Keynes.

The village name is an Old English language word meaning &#x27;wooded hill where goats are kept&#x27;. In the Domesday Book in 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Gateherst&quot;; later names include Goathurst. At that time the manor was owned by Bishop Odo of Bayeux.

==History==
In 1582, Queen Elizabeth I made a grant of Gayhurst Manor &quot;in the event of its reversion to the Crown&quot; to Sir Francis Drake, but there is no record that he ever received it. The house once belonged to Sir Everard Digby (1578–1606), one of the conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. His son, Sir Kenelm Digby (1603–1665), was an English courtier, diplomat, natural philosopher and astrologer. He was born at Gayhurst.

Gayhurst had an outstation from the Bletchley Park codebreaking establishment, where one of the Bombes used to decode German Enigma messages in World War Two were housed.

===Listed buildings and structures===
The parish has two buildings listed at Grade I, five at Grade II* and 20 at grade II. The (Grade I listed) Church of St Peter was built in the classical style in 1728 to replace a medieval church; the designer is unknown.

<doc id="404641" wikidata="Q3107449" url="?curid=404641" title="Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album was awarded from 1983 to 2011 and from 2017 onwards. Until 1992 the award was known as Best Traditional Blues Performance and was twice awarded to individual tracks rather than albums.

The award was discontinued after the 2011 Grammy season in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012 onwards, the category was merged with the [[Best Contemporary Blues Album]] category to form the new [[Best Blues Album]] category. However, in 2016 the Grammy organisation decided to revert the situation back to the pre-2012 era, with two separate categories for traditional and contemporary blues recordings respectively.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for music released in the previous year. B.B. King holds the record of most wins in the category with ten.

<doc id="404646" wikidata="Q177254" url="?curid=404646" title="Farsightedness">
<text>Far-sightedness, also known as long-sightedness, hypermetropia, and hyperopia, is a condition of the eye where distant objects are seen clearly but near objects appear blurred. This blur is due to incoming light being focused behind, instead of on, the retina due to insufficient accommodation by the lens. Minor hypermetropia in young patients is usually corrected by their accommodation, without any defects in vision. But, due to this accommodative effort for distant vision, people may complain of eye strain during prolonged reading. If the hypermetropia is high, there will be defective vision for both distance and near. People may also experience accommodative dysfunction, binocular dysfunction, amblyopia, and strabismus. Newborns are almost invariably hypermetropic, but it gradually decreases as the newborn gets older.
There are many causes for this condition. It may occur when the axial length of eyeball is too short or if the lens or cornea is flatter than normal. Changes in refractive index of lens, alterations in position of the lens or absence of lens are the other main causes. Risk factors include a family history of the condition, diabetes, certain medications, and tumors around the eye. It is a type of refractive error. Diagnosis is based on an eye exam.
Management can occur with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or refractive corneal surgeries. Glasses are easiest while contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision. Surgery works by changing the shape of the cornea. Far-sightedness primarily affects young children, with rates of 8% at 6 years old and 1% at 15 years old. It then becomes more common again after the age of 40, known as presbyopia, affecting about half of people. The best treatment option to correct hypermetropia due to aphakia is IOL implantation.

Other common types of refractive errors are near-sightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia.

==Signs and symptoms==
In young patients, mild hypermetropia may not produce any symptoms. The signs and symptoms of far-sightedness include blurry vision, frontal or fronto temporal headaches, eye strain, tiredness of eyes, etc. The common symptom is eye strain. Difficulty seeing with both eyes (binocular vision) may occur, as well as difficulty with depth perception. The asthenopic symptoms and near blur are usually seen after close work, especially in the evening or night.

===Complications===
Far-sightedness can have rare complications such as strabismus and amblyopia. At a young age, severe far-sightedness can cause the child to have double vision as a result of &quot;over-focusing&quot;.

Hypermetropic patients with short axial length are at higher risk of developing primary angle closure glaucoma, so routine gonioscopy and glaucoma evaluation is recommended for all hypermetropic adults.

==Causes==
Simple hypermetropia, the most common form of hypermetropia, is caused by normal biological variations in the development of eyeball. Aetiologically, causes of hypermetropia can be classified as:
* Axial: Axial hypermetropia occur when the axial length of eyeball is too short. About 1 mm decrease in axial length cause 3 diopters of hypermetropia. One condition that cause axial hypermetropia is nanophthalmos.
* Curvatural: Curvatural hypermetropia occur when curvature of lens or cornea is flatter than normal. About 1 mm increase in radius of curvature results in 6 diopters of hypermetropia. Cornea is flatter in microcornea and cornea plana.
* Index: Age related changes in refractive index (cortical sclerosis) can cause hypermetropia. Another cause of index hypermetropia is diabetes. Occasionally, mild hypermetropic shift may be seen in association with cortical or subcapsular cataract also.
* Positional: Positional hypermetropia occur due to posterior dislocation of Lens or IOL. It may occur due to trauma.
* Consecutive: Consecutive hypermetropia occur due to surgical over correction of myopia or surgical under correction in cataract surgery.
* Functional: Functional hypermetropia results from paralysis of accommodation as seen in internal ophthalmoplegia, CN III palsy etc.
* Absence of lens: Congenital or acquired aphakia cause high degree hypermetropia.

Far-sightedness is often present from birth, but children have a very flexible eye lens, which helps to compensate. In rare instances, hyperopia can be due to diabetes, as well as problems with the blood vessels in the retina.

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis of far-sightedness is made by utilizing either a retinoscope or an automated refractor-objective refraction; or trial lenses in a trial frame or a phoropter to obtain a subjective examination.
Ancillary tests for abnormal structures and physiology can be made via a slit lamp test, which examines the cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, and iris.

In severe cases of hyperopia from birth, the brain has difficulty in merging the images that each individual eye sees. This is because the images the brain receives from each eye are always blurred. A child with severe hyperopia can never see objects in detail. If the brain never learns to see objects in detail, then there is a high chance of one eye becoming dominant. The result is that the brain will block the impulses of the non-dominant eye. In contrast, the child with myopia can see objects close to the eye in detail and does learn at an early age to see objects in detail.

===Classification===
Hyperopia is typically classified according to clinical appearance, its severity, or how it relates to the eye&#x27;s accommodative status.

====Clinical classification====
There are three clinical categories of hyperopia.
* Simple hyperopia: Occurs naturally due to biological diversity.
* Pathological hyperopia: Caused by disease, trauma, or abnormal development.
* Functional hyperopia: Caused by paralysis that interferes eye&#x27;s ability to accommodate.

====Classification according to severity====
There are also three categories severity:
* Low: Refractive error less than or equal to +2.00 diopters (D).
* Moderate: Refractive error greater than +2.00 D up to +5.00 D.
* High: Refractive error greater than +5.00 D.

====Components of hypermetropia====
Accommodation has significant role in hyperopia. Considering accommodative status, hyperopia can be classified as:
* Total hypermetropia: It is the total amount of hyperopia which is obtained after complete relaxation of accommodation using cycloplegics like atropine.
* Latent hyperopia: It is the amount of hyperopia normally corrected by ciliary tone (approximately 1 diopter).
* Manifest hyperopia: It is the amount of hyperopia not corrected by ciliary tone. Manifest hyperopia is further classified into two, facultative and absolute.
** Facultative hyperopia: It is the part of hyperopia corrected by patient&#x27;s accommodation.
** Absolute hyperopia: It is the residual part of hyperopia which causes blurring of vision for distance.

So, Total hyperopia= latent hyperopia + manifest hyperopia (facultative + absolute)

==Treatment==
===Corrective lenses===
The simplest form of treatment for far-sightedness is the use of corrective lenses, i.e. eyeglasses or contact lenses. Eyeglasses used to correct far-sightedness have convex lenses.

===Surgery===
There are also surgical treatments for far-sightedness:

Laser procedures
* Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK): This is a refractive technique that is done by removal of a minimal amount of the corneal surface. Hyperopic PRK has many complications like regression effect, astigmatism due to epithelial healing, and corneal haze. Post operative epithelial healing time is also more for PRK.
* Laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): Laser eye surgery to reshape the cornea, so that glasses or contact lenses are no longer needed. Excimer laser LASIK can correct hypermetropia up to +6 diopters. LASIK is contraindicated in patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
* Laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK): Resembles PRK, but uses alcohol to loosen the corneal surface.
* Epi-LASIK: Epi-LASIK is also used to correct hyperopia. In this procedure, use of epikeratome eliminates the use of alcohol.
* Laser thermal keratoplasty (LTK): Laser thermal keratoplasty is a laser based non-destructive refractive procedure used to correct hyperopia and presbyopia. It uses Thallium-Holmium-Chromium (THC): YAG laser.

IOL implantation
* Aphakia correction: High degree hypermetropia due to absence of lens (aphakia) is best corrected using intraocular lens implantation.
* Refractive lens exchange (RLE): A variation of cataract surgery where the natural crystalline lens is replaced with an artificial intraocular lens; the difference is the existence of abnormal ocular anatomy which causes a high refractive error.
* Phakic IOL: Phakic intraocular lens are lenses that implanted inside eye without removing the normal crystalline lens. Phakic IOLs can be used to correct hypermetropia up to +20 diopters.

Non laser procedures
* Conductive keratoplasty (CK): Conductive keratoplasty is a non laser refractive procedure used to correct presbyopia and low hypermetropia (+0.75D to +3.25D) with or without astigmatism (up to 0.75D). It uses radiofrequency energy to heat and shrink corneal collagen tissue. CK is contraindicated in pregnant/breastfeeding women, central corneal dystrophies and scarring, history of herpetic keratitis, type 1 diabetes etc.
* Automated lamellar keratoplasty (ALK): Hyperopic automated lamellar keratoplasty (H-ALK) and Homoplastic ALK are ALK procedures that corrects low to moderate hyperopia. Poor predictability and the risk of complications limits usefulness of these procedures.
* Keratophakia and epi-keratophakia are another two non laser surgical procedures used to correct hypermetropia. Keratophakia is a surgical technique developed by Barraquer for treating high hypermetropia and aphakia. Poor predictability and induced irregular astigmatism are complications of these procedures.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;hyperopia&quot; comes from Greek ὑπέρ &quot;hyper&quot; &quot;over&quot; and ὤψ &quot;ōps&quot; &quot;sight&quot; ( ὠπός &quot;ōpos&quot;).
