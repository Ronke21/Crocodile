<text>The Savage Islands or Selvagens Islands ( ; also known as the Salvage Islands) are a small Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean, south of Madeira and north of the Canary Islands. The archipelago includes two major islands, Selvagem Grande and Selvagem Pequena, each surrounded by a cluster of islets and reefs, with the total area of . The archipelago is administered as part of the Portuguese municipality of Funchal, belongs to the Madeiran civil parish of Sé, and is the southernmost point of Portugal.

It was designated a natural reserve in 1971, recognising its role as a very important nesting point for several species of birds. Since then, the susceptible bird populations (namely Cory&#x27;s shearwater) and nearby waters have been more closely protected by the Portuguese government. Given its status, remoteness and few fresh water sources, the archipelago is today largely uninhabited. The only residents year-round are stationed on Selvagem Grande Island, which includes reserve staff and scientists conducting research on wildlife. Two rangers are also usually resident on Selvagem Pequena between May and October. In May 2016, a National Geographic Society scientific expedition prompted the extension of the marine reserve.

==Geography==

The Savage Islands are part of Macaronesia, which comprises several island groups in the North Atlantic Ocean, near Europe and off the coast of Morocco in North Africa. The archipelago lies about from Madeira and from the Canary Islands. The islands are considered to be a &quot;column branch&quot; that extends from the Canary Islands at depth of . The total land area of the Savage Islands is .
They have little fresh water and are surrounded by reefs (which make access difficult and dangerous). The archipelago consists of two major islands and several islets, in two groups about apart, designated:

* Northeast Group – includes the main island of Selvagem Grande () and three small islets: Sinho Islet (Portuguese: &quot;Ilhéu Sinho&quot;), Palheiro do Mar, and Palheiro da Terra.
* Southwest Group – including the main island of Selvagem Pequena () and Fora Islet (Portuguese: &quot;Ilhéu de Fora&quot;, ), also called Great Piton and Little Piton respectively, it is surrounded by a group of very small islets (&quot;Alto, Comprido&quot; and &quot;Redondo&quot;) and a group collectively known as the Northern Islets (Portuguese: &quot;Ilhéus do Norte&quot;).

The geological history of the archipelago can be traced to the Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 200 mya, at the end of the Triassic period.

The islands&#x27; physical characteristics are the consequences of mountain-forming and volcanic forces that occurred between 60 and 70 million years ago, typical of many of the islands of Macaronesia. The islands were created during the Oligocene period 29 million years ago, from a large submarine volcano generated by the Canary hotspot and shaped by erosion and marine sedimentation. The larger islands and islet (Grande, Pequena and Fora, respectively) are the remnants of the peaks of these submarine mounts, and although located north of the Canaries, they were never connected to the African continent or any other continental landmass.

The archipelago had 2 historic magmatic activity periods, one 29.5 mya and the other one 3.4 mya and two significant hiatuses between eruptions, the first lasted 12 million years and the second lasted 4.6 million years, a unique occurrence to oceanic volcanic islands.

The islands themselves are crossed by many calcareous faults, some marbleised, and made of basaltic rock, ash, and other volcanic materials. On Selvagem Grande there are remnants of extinct cones, such as Atalaia, Tornozelos and Cabeço do Inferno. Other areas are sand covered from extensive aeolian, fluvial and marine erosion; headlands include Atalaia and Leste on Selvagem Grande, and Norte, Oeste, Leste and Garajaus on Selvagem Pequena.

Beaches are uncommon in the islands, although Selvagem Pequena has some beaches of cobbles and coarse and medium sands.

==Climate==

Though only as recently as 2016 was a meteorological station installed by IPMA on Selvagem Grande, the islands are regarded as having a mild subtropical desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;), with temperatures warmer than those of Madeira. Due to their small size, the surrounding Atlantic and other exterior factors dictate the weather patterns felt throughout the year. Both diurnal and seasonal temperature variation are very low. The lack of any significant mountain range diminishes the amount of orographically induced precipitation and its exposure to the cool Canary Current prevents the formation of convective clouds for most of the year. Summers hover between during the day and during the night, and winters average around during the day and during the night. Saharan dust can occasionally come into contact with the islands, bringing much higher temperatures. Winds blowing from south-west can also bring exceptionally heavy rainfall. The dominant wind direction is Northeast (NE).

In the past these islands would have had a higher level of moisture than they do now, which may justify the presence of a large number of fossil shells of land snails (&quot;Theba macandrewiana&quot;) on the plateau of Selvagem Grande.

==Fauna and flora==
The scientific and natural interest of this tiny group of islands lies in its marine biodiversity, its unique flora and fauna and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns.

The Selvagens Islands and their surrounding waters present pristine marine and terrestrial communities, with many of its ecosystems in an unaltered state (such as in Selvagem Pequena and Ilhéu de Fora) and habitat for a wide variety of endemic species and species in an unfavorable state of conservation, they are a unique example of the Macaronesian biogeographical region biota.

The archipelago has the highest density (per 100 km) of exclusive endemic terrestrial plants of the Macaronesian Region and the lowest number of exotic terrestrial plants taxa (17) of the Madeira Region.

Although commercial tours of the islands and their biomes are available, all visitors require authorisation from the Madeira Nature Park, the regional environmental authority.

===Birds===

Selvagens Islands are one of the most important breeding areas for seabirds of Macaronesia and the North Atlantic, offering conditions that are unique in all the world.
About 3% of the birds species are resident species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At the end of the 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20–22,000 Cory&#x27;s shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands; the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff pillows and comforters.

Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory&#x27;s shearwaters (&gt;30,000), white-faced storm-petrel (&gt;80,000), Bulwer&#x27;s petrel (approximately 4000), North Atlantic little shearwater (1400), Madeiran storm-petrel (1500), yellow-legged gull (50), common tern (&gt;60), roseate tern (&lt;5) and Berthelot&#x27;s pipit (the only resident bird species); which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of these species are vulnerable to other local predator bird species, like the yellow-legged gull, which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced storm-petrel and Bulwer&#x27;s petrel are primarily susceptible). The islands are home to the largest known breeding colony in the world of Cory&#x27;s shearwater and the only site in the Atlantic where Swinhoe&#x27;s storm petrel can be regularly found. The Selvagens archipelago has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its seabird colonies.

===Sealife===
Jacques-Yves Cousteau once found what he believed were &quot;the cleanest waters in the world&quot; around this minor archipelago; there is an abundance of marine activity, much endemic to the environment, including the barred hogfish, puffer fish (Tetraodontidae), sea spider and many species of sea urchin. At depth of about the waters around the islands are teeming with algae and many migratory species of common fish, routinely migrating from the islands of Cape Verde, Madeira and the Canaries.

Out of eight total species of sea turtle in the world, five of them occur in Selvagens Islands waters. The most frequent is the loggerhead turtle, followed by Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle, Hawksbill sea turtle, Green sea turtle and Leatherback sea turtle.

A total of 10 cetacean species are recorded for Selvagens Islands surrounding waters, including some with a &quot;Vulnerable&quot; or &quot;Threatened&quot; global conservation statuses according to IUCN list of threatened species such as fin whales, sperm whales, bottlenose dolphins, common dolphins, short-finned pilot whales, Atlantic spotted dolphins, pygmy sperm whale, sei whale, Bryde&#x27;s whale and a non-confirmed beaked whale species, but many others are expected to be discovered. The sub-tropical geographical position of Selvagens Islands puts it at the limit of the northern distribution range of many tropical oceanic cetaceans species and at the southern limit of species from more temperate latitudes.

Despite having a much smaller submerged area with depths less than than other larger Macaronesian archipelagos, the islands have remarkable fish species richness.
There are 88 known species of coastal fish, some of them included in endangered and vulnerable status such as the dusky grouper, the Island grouper or the barred hogfish. 27.3% of fish are from the tropical eastern Atlantic Ocean, 10.2% from temperate waters and 6.8% from subtropical waters.

===Other animals ===
Ten terrestrial vertebrates are known to live on these islands. Two terrestrial reptiles, &quot;Tarentola boettgeri bischoffi&quot;, a subspecies of Boettger&#x27;s wall gecko and &quot;Teira dugesii selvagensis&quot;, a subspecies of Madeiran wall lizard, are exclusive to Selvagens Islands.
The islands are the only terrestrial mammal-free archipelago in the Macaronesia of the North Atlantic.

The Selvagens archipelago is a hotspot of endemic terrestrial arthropods. There are about 219 species and subspecies of terrestrial invertebrates, 92% accounting for arthropods. About 20% of the whole taxa is endemic to the islands. Some endemic species include the sea snails &quot;Adeuomphalus marbisensis&quot;, &quot;Sticteulima lata&quot;, &quot;Alvania dijkstrai&quot;, &quot;Alvania freitasi&quot;, &quot;Alvania harrietae&quot;, &quot;Atlanta selvagensis&quot;, &quot;Manzonia boucheti&quot;, &quot;Osilinus atratus selvagensis&quot; and the land snail &quot;Theba macandrewiana&quot;.

Other terrestrial invertebrates endemic to the islands include three species of Cossoninae, two species of spider beetles, Cryptorhynchinae and Malachiinae and a species of Bean weevil, Click beetle, Thrips, Harpalinae, Pterostichinae, Lamiinae, Paederinae, Trogossitinae, Julida and a recently discovered species of Aplocnemus.

The current number of known endemic species and subspecies is certainly a poor estimate of its real number.

===Plantlife===
As a consequence of limited introduction, the terrestrial flora has an outstanding interest. More than 100 species of indigenous plants have been catalogued (most creeping plants and bushes). These plants are similar in many respects to indigenous species on the islands of Madeira and the Canaries, which are better suited to dry arid environments. Germination of these species occurs immediately and briefly after annual showers, and include: &quot;Lotus glaucus&quot; subsp. &quot;salvagensis&quot;, &quot;Scilla madeirensis&quot;, &quot;Monizia edulis&quot;, &quot;Erysimum arbuscula&quot;, &quot;Misopates salvagense&quot;, &quot;Urtica portosanctana&quot;, &quot;Asparagus nesiotes&quot;, &quot;Autonoe madeirensis&quot;, among others.

Some endemic species to the archipelago include: &quot;Argyranthemum thalassophilum&quot;, &quot;Monanthes lowei&quot; and &quot;Euphorbia anachoreta&quot; and 2 subspecies of &quot;Lobularia canariensis&quot;.

Selvagem Pequena and the Fora Islet are the richest floral repositories, since they were never populated by non-indigenous animals or plants. For a period, some indigenous species (primarily &quot;Roccella tinctoria&quot; and other lichens) were harvested from the islands to support the dye industry of Europe, primarily to England and Flanders in the 15th and 16th centuries, but these adventures were discontinued later.

==History==
Diogo Gomes de Sintra discovered the islands by chance in 1438. Although the Canary Islands had been inhabited by the Guanches, humans are not known to ever have set foot on the Madeira archipelago or the Savage Islands before the Portuguese discoveries and expansion. Consequently, this island group presented itself to Portuguese navigators uninhabited.

The first attempted settlement of the islands occurred around 1438 by the Portuguese, although few details remain of this endeavour. The oldest extant description of the colonisation was written around 1463 by the Portuguese mariner Diogo Gomes de Sintra. Gomes wrote that the islands were used to collect , as a base for red paint/dyes; referred to the lichens of the scientific families Roccellaceae and Parmeliaceae. In those days, the islands of the Atlantic (the Azores and Madeira) belonged to Henry the Navigator, the Grandmaster of the Order of Christ (the Portuguese successor to the Knights Templar in Portugal). However, the islands were generally omitted from the lists of their possessions.

By the 16th century the Savage Islands were held by a family from Madeira, known as &quot;Teixeiras Caiados&quot;. How the islands found themselves under Caiados control is unknown. In 1560 they were given to João Cabral de Noronha. After 1717 they are recorded in wills, inheritances, inventories and other documents. Between 1774 and 1831 taxes were paid to the king. The islands were also recorded in the books of the of Funchal.

From the 15th to the 19th centuries, the islands were used for different economic activities, such as collecting barilla weed and shells and mollusks. The islands, although uninhabited, were also used as a waypoint for fishing, while goats and rabbits were hunted on Selvagem Grande. Until about 1967, in September or October, there were organised hunts for the chicks of the Cory&#x27;s shearwaters for their oil and meat.

The islands have a reputation as pirate treasure islands, and there are many stories of treasure hunting. According to reliable primary documents, at least four times (in 1813, 1851, 1856 and 1948), serious dig attempts were made to recover the supposed treasures but nothing was found.

In 1904 the islands were sold to Luís Rocha Machado. The Permanent Commission of International Maritime Law gave sovereignty of the Savage Islands to Portugal on 15 February 1938.

In 1959, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), now known as the World Wide Fund for Nature, became interested in the islands and signed a contract/promise with the owner, Luís Rocha Machado. In 1971 the Portuguese government intervened and acquired the islands, converting them into a nature reserve. The Savage Islands Reserve was created as part of the Madeira Nature Park; it is one of the oldest nature reserves of Portugal and it also includes the surrounding shelf to a depth of . In 1976, permanent surveillance began, and in 1978 the reserve was elevated to the status of Nature Reserve. In 2002, part of the nature reserve was nominated for UNESCO&#x27;s list of World Heritage Sites: they are currently included in the tentative World Heritage Site list.

In the 21st century, the Savage Islands have a permanent team of wardens from Madeira Nature Reserve (on Selvagem Grande there is a permanent research station with two wardens year-round, while Selvagem Pequena is staffed usually by two wardens between May and October). These and the Zino family (a family of British origin, known as &quot;the guardians of the Savages&quot;) are the only permanent human inhabitants of the islands. Selvagem Grande gained a weather station controlled by IPMA (the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and the Atmosphere) and is permanently patrolled by the Portuguese Maritime Police to improve safety in navigation and search and rescue, and to prevent pollution and stop illegal fisheries in the reserve.

===Disputed territory===

Portugal places its southernmost exclusive economic zone claim south of the Savage Islands. Spain formerly objected to it on the basis that the Savage Islands do not have a separate continental shelf, stating that the border should comprise an equidistant line drawn halfway between Madeira and the Canaries. According to article 121 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea: &quot;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.&quot; The status of the Savage Islands as islands or rocks was thus at the core of the dispute.

Despite the islands having numerous visitors, mostly for scientific purposes, and the fact that several settlements were tried throughout the centuries, today the Savage Islands are a special natural reserve whose only year-round inhabitants are the wardens of Madeira&#x27;s Natural Park. Over the years, apart from the EEZ debate, a number of issues pertaining to the Savage Islands led to disputes between the two countries, namely the construction of a lighthouse, the administration of airspace (done from the closer Canary Islands), the right to perform military air exercises, and, most importantly, illegal fishing and poaching in the archipelago and its vicinity.

====19th century====
* 1880s – In an 1881 Maritime Signalisation Commission meeting, Spain requested the building of a lighthouse on the islands. The Portuguese recognised the importance of the lighthouse to the Canary Islands sea route, but deemed it not a priority at the time. In response, the Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry stated that &quot;the sovereignty of the islands is unclear&quot;.

====20th century====
* 1910s – In 1911, given the lack of action over the requested lighthouse, Spain said it would build it on its own (and annex the archipelago). After a Portuguese protest questioning what it termed &quot;Spanish confusion&quot; over the issue, Spain said its intention was to reach an agreement &quot;in the most amicable terms&quot;. In 1913, the Portuguese Navy conducted a survey, led by Admiral Schultz Xavier, of the Selvagem Grande Island and recommended &quot;Pico da Atalaia&quot; as the best location for the lighthouse.
* 1930s – On February 15, 1938, the Permanent Commission of International Maritime Law declared Portugal as the legitimate sovereign over the islands. The Spanish government, however, was in the midst of fighting the Spanish Civil War and did not have the opportunity to present its case to the commission.
* 1970s – In 1971, the Portuguese government bought the islands from their previous Madeiran owner, and decreed the creation of a natural reserve in the archipelago to protect the area from illegal fishing and poaching, which had severely reduced the bird populations in recent years. In 1972, two Spanish civilian boats, &quot;San Pedro de Abona&quot; and &quot;Áries&quot;, were arrested near the islands. In 1975, fishermen from the Canary Islands disembarked in the islands and waved a Spanish flag. In 1976 another Spanish boat, &quot;Ecce Homo Divino&quot;, was detained for illegal fishing.
* 1996-1997 – On 8 April 1996, Spanish F-18 fighters overflew the islands, followed by a low altitude Puma SA-330J flyby over Selvagem Grande on August 2. On the following October 16th, another F-18 flyby over the reserve was filmed by the Portuguese RTP TV channel, prompting the Portuguese Foreign Affairs Ministry to protest. In May 1997, the Ministry of Defense formally requested the Spanish government to stop training exercises near the natural reserve. Spain agreed, but on 1 August 1997 and 24 September 1997, new flybys by Spanish airplanes took place in the vicinity, prompting vehement protests from the Portuguese authorities which led to a formal apology by the Spanish ambassador to Portugal, after which the flights stopped. After this period, the islands were reinforced with a small Portuguese Navy detachment, purportedly to help patrol the islands against illegal fishing and poaching. Later in 1997, Spain formally recognised Portuguese sovereignty over the islands.

====21st century====
* 2005 – 23 June, four Spanish fishing boats were detained south of the islands. A few days later, on 8 July, a biologist and one of the nature reserve wardens in the Selvagem Grande Island were threatened with a knife and underwater fishing spear guns by a group of Spanish fishermen. A group of ten Portuguese marines were placed on the island for a month to put an end to poaching of protected species.
* 2007 – June, one Spanish search and rescue airplane flew over the islands at low altitude, prompting the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment to contact its Spanish counterpart over the issue.
* 2013 – 5 July, Spain sends letter officially complaining to the UN that the Savage islands are just rocks, which would invalidate the Portuguese sovereignty over the claimed EEZ surrounding the islands.
* 2013 – 18 July, The serving President of Portugal, Aníbal Cavaco Silva with the President of the Regional Government of Madeira, Alberto João Jardim arrived on the islands on board the Portuguese Navy frigate &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot; visit and stay on the Islands as part of a tour to meet residents and officials based there. Aníbal Cavaco Silva became the first President to stay overnight on the islands as former Presidents Mário Soares and Jorge Sampaio only visited for a few hours.
*2014 – The head of the Spanish Government, Mariano Rajoy, announced that Repsol, an Oil and Gas company will conduct surveys to find oil and gas in the surrounding waters of the nearby Canary Islands, would begin &quot;very likely&quot; between July and September.
*2014 – 22 September, Canarian secessionists on behalf of the Canarian Nationalist Alternative party, staged a protest on the smaller island of Selvagem Pequena, to urge the Portuguese government to intercede with the European Parliament so as not to jeopardise the fragile and unique biodiversity of the Macaronesian islands, before the Spanish government completely surrenders to the interests of Repsol. After two days the protestors were transported to Funchal by the Portuguese Navy.
*2014 – 17 December, Spain sends Dr Luis Somoza Losada to the UN to give a 448-point report asking for the expansion of Spanish territory at the expense of Portugal. After returning to Spain from New York he states &quot;It&#x27;s the biggest enlargement of Spanish sovereignty since Christopher Columbus&quot;. Luis Somoza Losada was a coordinator of a team made up of civilians and military that was commissioned to underpin the ambitious maritime expansion of Spain around the Savage Islands. Conducting 6 surveys of the area on 3 ships: the Hespérides, Miguel Oliver and Sarmiento de Gamboa, he discovered that there was gas in the area and possibly oil.
*2016 – 21 August, the territory starts being permanently patrolled by two elements of the &quot;Polícia Marítima&quot;, the Portuguese water police, stationed on the Selvagem Grande Island.
*2016 – 30 August, Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, joined by the Minister for Internal Administration Constança Urbano de Sousa, and the President of the Regional Government of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque, visited Selvagem Grande. Rebelo de Sousa remarked that &quot;Wherever the President of the Republic goes, he marks our territory&quot;, and justified the voyage by saying that the Head of State must go to every part of the national territory.

<doc id="396451" wikidata="Q3834457" url="?curid=396451" title="List of political parties in Argentina">
<text>This article lists political parties in Argentina.

Argentina has a multi-party system with two strong political parties or alliances, and various smaller parties that enjoy representation at the National Congress.

Since the 1990s, there is a strong decentralizing tendency within the national parties, along with the growing national relevance of province-level parties and alliances. In the last decade, most of the newly formed parties remained as junior partners of the main alliances or as district-level relevant political forces.

==Historic background==
From the &quot;national organisation&quot; process (1862–80) up to 1916, the oligarchic National Autonomist Party directed Argentine politics, before being replaced, through the first secret ballot elections, by the Radical Civic Union. The &quot;Infamous Decade&quot; (1930–43), initiated by the first modern coup d&#x27;état in Argentina, represented a return of the conservatives, who implemented a so-called &quot;patriotic fraud&quot; electoral practice. Since 1946, the strongest party has been the Justicialist Party, emerging around the leadership of Juan Perón (when not banned, justicialists lost only four presidential elections, in 1983, 1999, 2015, and 2023). From 1946 to 2001, the second most important party was the Radical Civic Union, until the 2001 financial crisis. From then on, left-wing Justicialists Néstor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernández de Kirchner won the 2003, 2007 and 2011 general elections. After that, in the 2015 general election, Kirchnerism was defeated by a Centre-right coalition, Cambiemos, composed of the Radical Civic Union and Republican Proposal, a new liberal conservative party. However, in the elections of 2019, the Justicialist Party joined the Frente de Todos (a Centre-left coalition) which won the presidential elections. The PJ returned to power, with Alberto Fernández as President of the Nation.

Since 10 December 2023, the current-ruing party in Argentina is the Libertarian Party, with Javier Milei as President of the Nation.

<text>Max Theodor Felix von Laue (; 9 October 1879 – 24 April 1960) was a German physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914 for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals.

In addition to his scientific endeavors with contributions in optics, crystallography, quantum theory, superconductivity, and the theory of relativity, Laue had a number of administrative positions which advanced and guided German scientific research and development during four decades. A strong objector to Nazism, he was instrumental in re-establishing and organizing German science after World War II.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Laue was born in Pfaffendorf, now part of Koblenz, Germany, to Julius Laue and Minna Zerrenner. In 1898, after passing his &quot;Abitur&quot; in Strassburg, he began his compulsory year of military service, after which in 1899 he started to study mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the University of Strassburg, the University of Göttingen, and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). At Göttingen, he was greatly influenced by the physicists Woldemar Voigt and Max Abraham and the mathematician David Hilbert. After only one semester at Munich, he went to the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University of Berlin in 1902. There, he studied under Max Planck, who gave birth to the quantum theory revolution on 14 December 1900, when he delivered his famous paper before the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft. At Berlin, Laue attended lectures by Otto Lummer on heat radiation and interference spectroscopy, the influence of which can be seen in Laue&#x27;s dissertation on interference phenomena in plane-parallel plates, for which he received his doctorate in 1903. Thereafter, Laue spent 1903 to 1905 at Göttingen. Laue completed his Habilitation in 1906 under Arnold Sommerfeld at LMU.

==Career==
He was a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in Berlin and an assistant to Planck. He also met Albert Einstein for the first time; their friendship contributed to the acceptance and development of Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. Laue continued as assistant to Planck until 1909. In Berlin, he worked on the application of entropy to radiation fields and on the thermodynamic significance of the coherence of light waves.

From 1909 to 1912, Laue was a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, under Arnold Sommerfeld, at LMU. During the 1911 Christmas recess and in January 1912, Paul Peter Ewald was finishing the writing of his doctoral thesis under Sommerfeld. It was on a walk through the Englischer Garten in Munich in January, that Ewald told Laue about his thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to Ewald were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence much larger than the spacing between the resonators in Ewald&#x27;s crystal model. Laue seemed distracted and wanted to know what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, Sommerfeld reported to the Physikalische Gesellschaft of Göttingen on the successful diffraction of X-rays by Laue, Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich at LMU, for which Laue would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1914. While at Munich, he wrote the first volume of his book on relativity during the period 1910 to 1911.
In 1912, Laue was called to the University of Zurich as an extraordinarius professor of physics. Upon his father&#x27;s elevation to the ranks of hereditary nobility in 1913, he became &#x27;Max &quot;von&quot; Laue&#x27;. A new professor extraordinarius chair of theoretical physics had been created in 1914 at the University of Berlin. He was offered the position but turned it down, and it was offered to Max Born. But Born was in the army until WW I ended, and before he had occupied the chair, Laue changed his mind and accepted the position.
From 1914 to 1919, Laue was at the University of Frankfurt as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics. He was engaged in vacuum tube development, at the University of Würzburg, for use in military telephony and wireless communications from 1916.

He was called to the University of Berlin as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics, a position he held from 1919 until 1943, when he was declared emeritus, with his consent and one year before the mandatory retirement age. At the university in 1919, other notables were Walther Nernst, Fritz Haber, and James Franck. Laue, as one of the organizers of the weekly Berlin Physics Colloquium, typically sat in the front row with Nernst and Einstein, who would come over from the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik in Berlin-Dahlem, where he was the director. Among Laue&#x27;s notable students at the university were Leó Szilárd, Fritz London, Max Kohler, and Erna Weber. He published the second volume of his book on relativity in 1921.

As a consultant to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR), Laue met Walther Meissner who was working there on superconductivity. Meissner had discovered that a weak magnetic field decays rapidly to zero in the interior of a superconductor, which is known as the Meissner effect. Laue showed, in 1932, that the threshold of the applied magnetic field which destroys superconductivity varies with the shape of the body. He published a total of 12 papers and a book on superconductivity. One of the papers was co-authored with brothers Fritz and Heinz London. Meissner published a biography on Laue in 1960.

The Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften (Today: Max-Planck Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften) was founded in 1911. Its purpose was to promote the sciences by founding and maintaining research institutes. One such institute was the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik (KWIP) founded in Berlin-Dahlem in 1914, with Einstein as director. Laue was a trustee of the institute from 1917, and in 1922 he was appointed deputy director, whereupon he took over the administrative duties from Einstein. Einstein was traveling abroad when Adolf Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933, and Einstein did not return to Germany. Laue then became acting director of the KWIP, a position he held until 1946 or 1948, except for the period 1935 to 1939, when Peter Debye was director. In 1943, to avoid casualties to the personnel, the KWIP moved to Hechingen. It was at Hechingen that Laue wrote his book on the history of physics &quot;Geschichte der Physik&quot;, which was eventually translated into seven other languages.

=== Opposition to Nazism ===
Laue opposed Nazism in general and &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; in particular – the former persecuted the Jews, in general, and the latter, among other things, put down Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity as &quot;Jewish physics&quot;, which Laue saw as ridiculous: &quot;science has no race or religion&quot;. Laue and his close friend Otto Hahn secretly helped scientific colleagues persecuted by Nazi policies to emigrate from Germany. Laue also openly opposed Nazi antisemitism. An address on 18 September 1933 at the opening of the physics convention in Würzburg, opposition to Johannes Stark, an obituary note on Fritz Haber in 1934, and attendance at a commemoration for Haber are examples which clearly illustrate Laue&#x27;s courageous, open opposition:
*Laue, as chairman of the &quot;Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft&quot;, gave the opening address at the 1933 physics convention. In it, he compared the persecution of Galileo and the oppression of his scientific views on the solar theory of Copernicus to the then conflict and persecution over the theory of relativity by the proponents of Deutsche Physik, against the work of Einstein, labeled &quot;Jewish physics.&quot;
*Johannes Stark, who had received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919, wished to become the &quot;Führer&quot; of German physics and was a proponent of &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot;. Against the unanimous advice of those consulted, Stark was appointed President of the PTR in May 1933. However, Laue successfully blocked Stark&#x27;s regular membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences.
*Haber received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918. In spite of this and his many other contributions to Germany, he was forced to emigrate from Germany as a result of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which removed Jews from their jobs. Laue&#x27;s obituary note praising Haber and comparing his forced emigration to the expulsion of Themistocles from Athens was a direct affront to National Socialism.
*In connection with Haber, Max Planck, Otto Hahn and Laue organized a commemoration event held in Berlin-Dahlem on 29 January 1935, the first anniversary of Haber&#x27;s death – attendance at the event by professors in the civil service had been expressly forbidden by the government. While many scientific and technical personnel were represented at the memorial by their wives, Laue and Wolfgang Heubner were the only two professors to attend. This was yet another blatant demonstration of Laue&#x27;s opposition to National Socialism. The date of the first anniversary of Haber&#x27;s death was also one day before the second anniversary of National Socialism seizing power in Germany, thus further increasing the affront given by holding the event.

The speech and the obituary note earned Laue government reprimands. Furthermore, in response to Laue blocking Stark&#x27;s regular membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, Stark, in December 1933, had Laue sacked from his position as advisor to the PTR, which Laue had held since 1925. Chapters 4 and 5 of Mark Walker’s &quot;Nazi Science: Myth, Truth, and the Atomic Bomb&quot;, present a more detailed account of the struggle by Laue and Planck against the Nazi takeover of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.

In a commonly reported anecdote Laue is supposed to have carried parcels in his hands when exiting his house, so to avoid having to give the Nazi Salute.

=== Hidden Nobel prize ===
When Nazi Germany invaded Denmark in World War II, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the Nobel Prize gold medals of Laue and James Franck in aqua regia to prevent the Nazis from discovering them. At the time, it was illegal to take gold out of the country, and if it had been discovered that Laue had done so he could have faced prosecution in Germany. Hevesy placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then re-cast the Nobel Prize gold medals, using the original gold.

=== Post-war ===
On 23 April 1945, French troops entered Hechingen, followed the next day by a contingent of Operation Alsos – an operation to investigate the German nuclear energy effort, seize equipment, and prevent German scientists from being captured by the Soviets. The scientific advisor to the Operation was the Dutch-American physicist Samuel Goudsmit, who, adorned with a steel helmet, appeared at Laue&#x27;s home. Laue was taken into custody and taken to Huntingdon, England, and interned at Farm Hall with other scientists thought to be involved in nuclear research and development.

While incarcerated, Laue was a reminder to the other detainees that one could survive the Nazi reign without having &quot;compromised&quot;; this alienated him from others being detained. During his incarceration, Laue wrote a paper on the absorption of X-rays under interference conditions, which it was later published in &quot;Acta Crystallographica&quot;. On 2 October 1945, Laue, Otto Hahn, and Werner Heisenberg, were taken to meet with Henry Hallett Dale, president of the Royal Society, and other members of the Society. There, Laue was invited to attend the 9 November 1945 Royal Society meeting in memory of the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, who discovered X-rays; permission was, however, not forthcoming from the military authorities detaining von Laue.

Laue was returned to Germany early in 1946. He went back to being acting director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, which had been moved to Göttingen, West Germany. It was also in 1946 that the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft was renamed the Max-Planck Gesellschaft, and, likewise, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik became the Max-Planck Institut für Physik. Laue also became an adjunct professor at the University of Göttingen. In addition to his administrative and teaching responsibilities, Laue wrote his book on superconductivity, &quot;Theorie der Supraleitung&quot;, and revised his books on electron diffraction, &quot;Materiewellen und ihre Interferenzen&quot;, and the first volume of his two-volume book on relativity.

In July 1946, Laue went back to England, only four months after having been interned there, to attend an international conference on crystallography. This was a distinct honor, as he was the only German invited to attend. He was extended many courtesies by the British officer who escorted him there and back, and a well-known English crystallographer as his host; Laue was even allowed to wander around London on his own.

After the war, there was much to be done in re-establishing and organizing German scientific endeavors. Laue participated in some key roles. In 1946, he initiated the founding of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in only the British Occupation Zone, as the Allied Control Council would not initially allow organizations across occupation zone boundaries. During the war, the PTR had been dispersed; von Laue, from 1946 to 1948, worked on its re-unification across three zones and its location at new facilities in Braunschweig. Additionally, it took on a new name as the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, but administration was not taken over by Germany until after the formation of West Germany on 23 May 1949. In 1948, the President of the American Physical Society asked Laue to report on the status of physics in Germany; his report was published in 1949 in the &quot;American Journal of Physics&quot;. In 1950, Laue participated in the creation of the Verband Deutscher Physikalischer Gesellschaften, formerly affiliated under the Nordwestdeutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

In April 1951, Laue became director of the Max-Planck Institut für physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie, a position he held until 1959. In 1953, at the request of Laue, the Institute was renamed the Fritz Haber Institut für physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie der Max-Planck Gesellschaft.

===Personal life===
It was in 1913 that Laue&#x27;s father, Julius Laue, a civil servant in the military administration, was raised into the ranks of hereditary nobility. Thus Max Laue became Max von Laue. Laue married Magdalene Degen, while he was a Privatdozent at LMU. They had two children. Their son, Theodor Hermann von Laue (1916–2000), went to the United States in 1937, and received his B.A. and Ph.D. from Princeton University. After his service in the U.S. Army, Theodor taught modern history as a professor at various U.S. universities.

Among Laue&#x27;s chief recreational activities were mountaineering, motoring in his automobile, motor-biking, sailing, and skiing. While not a mountain climber, he did enjoy hiking on the Alpine glaciers with his friends.

On 8 April 1960, while he was driving to his laboratory in West Berlin, Laue&#x27;s car was struck by a motorcyclist, who had received his license only two days earlier. The motorcyclist was killed and Laue&#x27;s car was overturned. He died from his injuries sixteen days later on 24 April. Laue had asked that his epitaph should read that he had died trusting firmly in God&#x27;s mercy. He was buried in Göttingen.

<text>Thomas Otway (3 March 165214 April 1685) was an English dramatist of the Restoration period, best known for &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot;, or &quot;A Plot Discover&#x27;d&quot; (1682).

==Life==
Otway was born at Trotton near Midhurst, the parish of which his father, Humphrey Otway, was at that time curate. Humphrey later became rector of Woolbeding, a neighbouring parish, where Thomas Otway was brought up and expected to commit to priesthood. He was educated at Winchester College, and in 1669 entered Christ Church, Oxford, as a commoner, but left the university without a degree in the autumn of 1672. At Oxford he made the acquaintance of Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount Falkland, through whom, he says in the dedication to &quot;Caius Marius&quot;, he first learned to love books. In London he made acquaintance with Aphra Behn, who in 1672 cast him as the old king in her play, &quot;Forc&#x27;d Marriage, or The Jealous Bridegroom&quot;, at the Dorset Garden Theatre. However, due to severe stage fright, he gave an abysmal performance and never returned to the stage, instead opting to write what was being performed. The same year as the performance, his father died, triggering Otway to officially abandon any thoughts of priesthood and move to London to become a playwright, where he discovered his muse.

The muse he had fallen in love with was Elizabeth Barry, who played many of the leading parts in his plays. Six letters to her survive, the last of them referring to a broken appointment in the Mall. She seems to have flirted with Otway, but had no intention of permanently offending Rochester, her lover. In 1678, driven to desperation, Otway obtained a commission through Charles, Earl of Plymouth, a natural son of Charles II, in a regiment serving in the Netherlands. The English troops were disbanded in 1679, but were left to find their way home as best they could. They were paid with depreciated paper, and Otway arrived in London late in the year, ragged and dirty, a circumstance utilized by Elkanah Settle in his &quot;Sessions of the Poets&quot;.

Upon his return, he apparently ceased to struggle against his poverty and misfortunes. At one point in attempts to make money, he tutored the son of famed Restoration actress Nell Gwyn. The generally accepted story regarding the manner of his death was first given in Theophilus Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;. He is said to have emerged from his retreat at the Bull on Tower Hill to beg for bread. A passer-by, learning who he was, gave him a guinea, with which Otway hastened to a baker&#x27;s shop. He ate too hastily, and choked on the first mouthful. Whether this account of his death is true or not, it is certain that he died in the utmost poverty, and was buried on 16 April 1685 in the churchyard of St. Clement Danes.

==Writing career==

In 1675 Thomas Betterton produced Otway&#x27;s first play, &quot;Alcibiades&quot; at the Dorset Garden Theatre, where all but one of his plays would eventually be produced. It is a tragedy, written in heroic verse, saved from absolute failure only by the actors. Elizabeth Barry took the part of Draxilla, and her lover, John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, recommended Otway to the Duke of York (later King James II). He made a great improvement in &quot;Don Carlos, Prince of Spain&quot; (licensed 15 June 1676). The material for this rhymed tragedy came from the novel of the same name, written in 1672 by the Abbé de Saint-Real, the source from which Friedrich Schiller also drew his tragedy of &quot;Don Carlos&quot;. In it the two characters familiar throughout his plays make their appearance. Don Carlos is the impetuous, unstable youth, who seems to be drawn from Otway himself, while the queen&#x27;s part is the gentle pathetic character repeated in his more celebrated heroines, Monimia and Belvidera. It got more money, says John Downes (&quot;Roscius Anglicanus&quot;, 1708) of this play, than any preceding modern tragedy.

In 1677 Betterton produced two adaptations from the French by Otway, &quot;Titus and Berenice&quot; (from Racine&#x27;s &quot;Bérénice&quot;), and &quot;The Cheats of Scapin&quot; (from Molière&#x27;s &quot;Scapin the Schemer&quot;). These were printed together, with a dedication to Rochester. In 1678 he produced an original comedy, &quot;Friendship in Fashion&quot;, which was very successful.

In February 1680, the first of Otway&#x27;s two tragic masterpieces, &quot;The Orphan, or The Unhappy Marriage&quot;, was produced at the Dorset Garden, with Mrs. Barry playing the part of Monimia. Written in blank verse, modeled upon Shakespeare, its success was due to Otway&#x27;s mastery of tragic pathos found in the characters of Castalio and Monimia. &quot;The History and Fall of Caius Marius&quot;, produced in 1679 and first printed in 1680, is a curious grafting of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; on the story of Marius as related in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;. &quot;Caius Marius&quot; was incredibly popular during its time, outperforming &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for at least seventy years following its initial release.

In 1680, Otway also published &quot;The Poets Complaint of his Muse, or A Satyr against Libells&quot;, in which he retaliated against his literary enemies and critics. An indifferent comedy, &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1681), was followed in February 1682 by &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d, or A Plot Discover&#x27;d&quot;. The story is founded on the &quot;Histoire de la conjuration des Espagnols contre la Venise en 1618&quot;, also by the Abbé de Saint-Réal, but Otway modified the story considerably. The character of Belvidera is his own, and the leading part in the conspiracy, taken by Bedamor, the Spanish ambassador, is given in the play to the historically insignificant Pierre and Jaffeir. The piece has a political stance, with the narrative influenced by the fictitious conspiracy of the Popish Plot, which heightened anti-Catholic sentiments in England in favor of political advancement. His frustrations with such political scandals are evident in a caricature of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, a founder of the Whig party in the character of Antonio and in the play&#x27;s &quot;Prologue&quot;, in the following lines:

&quot;Poland, Poland! &quot;Had it been thy Lot&quot;,
&quot;T&#x27;have heard in time of this Venetian Plot&quot;;
&quot;Thou surely chosen hadst one King from thence&quot;,
&quot;And honour&#x27;d them as thou hast&quot; England &quot;since&quot;.&quot;

The allusion is to rumours current at the time that Shaftesbury had planned to make himself King of Poland. Because of this, and the silver pipe John Locke had inserted into him to drain an abscess, he was popularly referred to as &quot;Count Tapski&quot;.

&quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot; also contains an allusion to Rochester&#x27;s famous deathbed conversion, as reported in Gilbert Burnet&#x27;s &quot;Some Passages of the Life and Death of.. Rochester&quot; (1680). The conversion was doubted by many, and Otway is obviously skeptical, for when Pierre is on the scaffold, attended by a priest, he is made to say the following to his executioner (Act V, scene ii): &quot;Captain, I&#x27;d have hereafter / This fellow write no Lies of my Conversion.&quot;

The play won instant success. It was translated into almost every European language, and even Dryden said of it: &quot;Nature is there, which is the greatest beauty.&quot;

&quot;The Orphan&quot; and &quot;Venice Preserved&quot; remained stock pieces on the stage until the 19th century, and the leading actresses of the period played Monimia and Belvidera. His last and most obscure play is &quot;The Atheist&quot; (1684), although many see it as a way to cash in on his previous comic success with &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Fortune&quot;, some see it not as a weak sequel but as a &quot;brilliant experiment.&quot; One of the aims of the play is to show what happens after the wedding as sentimental conclusion in plays of the period through the figures of Courtine and Sylvia. The bleakness of their relations taint those of Beauregard and Porcia. The complexity of the plot, some of which derives from the &quot;Invisible Mistress,&quot; the first interpolated story in Paul Scarron&#x27;s &quot;Roman comique&quot;, speak of the maze of human life, a meaningless world left for the audience to decipher. One or two prefaces, and two posthumous pieces, a poem, &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; (1685), a panegyric of Charles II, and a &quot;History of the Triumvirates&quot; (1686), translated from the French, complete the list of Otway&#x27;s works. A tragedy entitled &quot;Heroick Friendship&quot; was printed in 1686 as Otway&#x27;s work, but the ascription is unlikely.

&quot;The Works of Mr. Thomas Otway&quot; with some account of his life and writings, published in 1712, was followed by other editions (1722, 1757, 1768, 1812). Through the 19th century the standard edition was that by T. Thornton (1813).

<doc id="396459" wikidata="Q133747" url="?curid=396459" title="William Henry Bragg">
<text>Sir William Henry Bragg (2 July 1862 – 12 March 1942) was an English physicist, chemist, mathematician, and active sportsman who uniquely shared a Nobel Prize with his son Lawrence Bragg – the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics: &quot;for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays&quot;. The mineral Braggite is named after him and his son. He was knighted in 1920.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Bragg was born at Westward, near Wigton, Cumberland, England, the son of Robert John Bragg, a merchant marine officer and farmer, and his wife Mary née Wood, a clergyman&#x27;s daughter. When Bragg was seven years old, his mother died, and he was raised by his uncle, also named William Bragg, at Market Harborough, Leicestershire. He was educated at the Grammar School there, at King William&#x27;s College on the Isle of Man and, having won an exhibition (scholarship), at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1884 as third wrangler, and in 1885 was awarded a first class honours in the mathematical tripos.

===University of Adelaide===
In 1885, at the age of 23, Bragg was appointed (Sir Thomas) Elder Professor of Mathematics and Experimental Physics in the University of Adelaide, Australia, and started work there early in 1886. Being a skilled mathematician, at that time he had limited knowledge of physics, most of which was in the form of applied mathematics he had learnt at Trinity. Also at that time, there were only about a hundred students doing full courses at Adelaide, of whom less than a handful belonged to the science school, whose deficient teaching facilities Bragg improved by apprenticing himself to a firm of instrument makers. Bragg was an able and popular lecturer; he encouraged the formation of the student union, and the attendance, free of charge, of science teachers at his lectures.

Bragg&#x27;s interest in physics developed, particularly in the field of electromagnetism. In 1895, he was visited by Ernest Rutherford, en route from New Zealand to Cambridge; this was the commencement of a lifelong friendship. Bragg had a keen interest in the new discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen. On 29 May 1896 at Adelaide, Bragg demonstrated before a meeting of local doctors the application of &quot;X-rays to reveal structures that were otherwise invisible&quot;. Samuel Barbour, senior chemist of F. H. Faulding &amp; Co., an Adelaide pharmaceutical manufacturer, supplied the necessary apparatus in the form of a Crookes tube, a glass discharge tube. The tube had been obtained at Leeds, England, where Barbour visited the firm of Reynolds and Branson, a manufacturer of photographic and laboratory equipment. Barbour returned to Adelaide in April 1896. Barbour had conducted his own experiments shortly after return to Australia, but results were limited due to limited battery power. At the University, the tube was attached to an induction coil and a battery borrowed from Sir Charles Todd, Bragg&#x27;s father-in-law. The induction coil was utilized to produce the electric spark necessary for Bragg and Barbour to &quot;generate short bursts of X-rays&quot;. The audience was favorably impressed. Bragg availed himself as a test subject, in the manner of Röntgen and allowed an X-ray photograph to be taken of his hand. The image of the fingers in his hand revealed &quot;an old injury to one of his fingers sustained when using the turnip chopping machine on his father&#x27;s farm in Cumbria&quot;.

As early as 1895, Bragg was working on wireless telegraphy, though public lectures and demonstrations focussed on his X-ray research which would later lead to his Nobel Prize. In a hurried visit by Rutherford, he was reported as working on a Hertzian oscillator. There were many common practical threads to the two technologies and he was ably assisted in the laboratory by Arthur Lionel Rogers who manufactured much of the equipment. On 21 September 1897 Bragg gave the first recorded public demonstration of the working of wireless telegraphy in Australia during a lecture meeting at the University of Adelaide as part of the Public Teachers&#x27; Union conference. Bragg departed Adelaide in December 1897, and spent all of 1898 on a 12-month leave of absence, touring Great Britain and Europe and during this time visited Marconi and inspected his wireless facilities. He returned to Adelaide in early March 1899, and already on 13 May 1899, Bragg and his father-in-law, Sir Charles Todd, were conducting preliminary tests of wireless telegraphy with a transmitter at the Observatory and a receiver on the South Road (about 200 metres). Experiments continued throughout the southern winter of 1899 and the range was progressively extended to Henley Beach. In September the work was extended to two way transmissions with the addition of a second induction coil loaned by Mr. Oddie of Ballarat. It was desired to extend the experiments cross a sea path and Todd was interested in connecting Cape Spencer and Althorpe Island, but local costs were considered prohibitive while the charges for patented equipment from the Marconi Company were exorbitant. At the same time Bragg&#x27;s interests were leaning towards X-rays and practical work in wireless in South Australia was largely dormant for the next decade.

The turning-point in Bragg&#x27;s career came in 1904 when he gave the presidential address to section A of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science at Dunedin, New Zealand, on &quot;Some Recent Advances in the Theory of the Ionization of Gases&quot;. This idea was followed up &quot;in a brilliant series of researches&quot; which, within three years, earned him a fellowship of the Royal Society of London. This paper was also the origin of his first book &quot;Studies in Radioactivity&quot; (1912). Soon after the delivery of his 1904 address, some radium bromide was made available to Bragg for experimentation. In December 1904 his paper &quot;On the Absorption of α Rays and on the Classification of the α Rays from Radium&quot; appeared in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;, and in the same issue a paper &quot;On the Ionization Curves of Radium&quot;, written in collaboration with his student Richard Kleeman, also appeared.

At the end of 1908, Bragg returned to England. During his 23 years in Australia &quot;he had seen the number of students at the University of Adelaide almost quadruple, and had a full share in the development of its excellent science school.&quot; He had returned to England on the maiden voyage of the SS &quot;Waratah&quot;, a ship which vanished at sea on its second voyage the next year. He had been alarmed at the ship&#x27;s tendency to list during his voyage, and had concluded that the ship&#x27;s metacentre was just below her centre of gravity. In 1911, he testified his belief that the &quot;Waratah&quot; was unstable at the Inquiry into the ship&#x27;s disappearance.

There is a bust of William Bragg in North Terrace, Adelaide, South Australia.

===University of Leeds===
Bragg occupied the Cavendish chair of physics at the University of Leeds from 1909 until 1915. He continued his work on X-rays with much success. He invented the X-ray spectrometer and with his son, Lawrence Bragg, then a research student at Cambridge, founded the new science of X-ray crystallography, the analysis of crystal structure using X-ray diffraction.

===World War I===

Both of his sons (Lawrence and Robert) were called into the army after war broke out in 1914 . The following year he was appointed Quain Professor of Physics at University College London. He had to wait for almost a year to contribute to the war effort: finally, in July 1915, he was appointed to the Board of Invention and Research set up by the Admiralty. In September, his younger son Robert died of wounds at Gallipoli. In November, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with elder son William Lawrence. The Navy was struggling to prevent sinkings by unseen, submerged U boats. The scientists recommended that the best tactic was to listen for the submarines. The Navy had a hydrophone research establishment at Aberdour Scotland, staffed with navy men. In November 1915, two young physicists were added to its staff. Bowing to outside pressure to use science, in July 1916, the Admiralty appointed Bragg as scientific director at Aberdour, assisted by three additional young physicists. They developed an improved directional hydrophone, which finally convinced the Admiralty of their usefulness. Late in 1916, Bragg with his small group moved to Harwich, where the staff was enlarged and they had access to a submarine for tests. In France, where scientists had been mobilized since the beginning of the war, the physicist Paul Langevin made a major stride with echolocation, generating intense sound pulses with quartz sheets oscillated at high frequency, which were then used as microphones to listen for echoes. Quartz was usable when vacuum tubes became available at the end of 1917 to amplify the faint signals. The British made sonar practicable by using mosaics of small quartz bits rather than slices from a large crystal. In January 1918, Bragg moved into the Admiralty as head of scientific research in the anti-submarine division. By war&#x27;s end British vessels were being equipped with sonar manned by trained listeners.

Inspired by William Lawrence&#x27;s methods for locating enemy guns by the sound of their firing, the output from six microphones miles apart along the coast were recorded on moving photographic film. Sound ranging is much more accurate in the sea than in the turbulent atmosphere. They were able to localize the sites of distant explosions, which were used to obtain the precise positions of British warships and of minefields.

===University College London===
After the war Bragg returned to University College London, where he continued to work on crystal analysis.

===Royal Institution===
From 1923, he was Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution and director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory. This institution was practically rebuilt in 1929–30 and, under Bragg&#x27;s directorship many valuable papers were issued from the laboratory. In 1919, 1923, 1925 and 1931 he was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;The World of Sound&quot;; &quot;Concerning the Nature of Things,&quot; &quot;Old Trades and New Knowledge&quot; and &quot;The Universe of Life&quot; respectively.

===The Royal Society and the coming war===
Bragg was elected president of the Royal Society in 1935. The physiologist A. V. Hill was biological secretary and soon A. C. G. Egerton became physical secretary. During World War I all three had stood by for frustrating months before their skills were employed for the war effort. Now the cause of science was strengthened by the report of a high-level Army committee on lessons learned in the last war; their first recommendation was to &quot;keep abreast of modern scientific developments&quot;. Anticipating another war, the Ministry of Labour was persuaded to accept Hill as a consultant on scientific manpower. The Royal Society compiled a register of qualified men. They proposed a small committee on science to advise the Committee on Imperial Defence, but this was rejected. Finally in 1940, as Bragg&#x27;s term ended, a scientific advisory committee to the War Cabinet was appointed. Brag was among the 2,300 names of prominent persons listed on the Nazis&#x27; Special Search List, of those who were to be arrested on the invasion of Great Britain and turned over to the Gestapo. Bragg died in 1942.

==Honours and awards==
Bragg was joint winner with his son, Lawrence Bragg, of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915: &quot;For their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-ray&quot;.

Bragg was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1907, vice-president in 1920, and served as President of the Royal Society from 1935 to 1940. He was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1939 and an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. He was elected as a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium on 1 June 1946.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1917 and Knight Commander (KBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours. He was admitted to the Order of Merit in 1931.

The current Electoral district of Bragg, in the South Australian House of Assembly, was created in 1970, and was named after both William and Lawrence Bragg.

==Private life==
In 1889, in Adelaide, Bragg married Gwendoline Todd, a skilled water-colour painter, and daughter of astronomer, meteorologist and electrical engineer Sir Charles Todd. They had three children, a daughter, Gwendolen and two sons, William Lawrence, born in 1890 in North Adelaide, and Robert. Gwendolen married the English architect Alban Caroe, Bragg taught William at the University of Adelaide, and Robert was killed in the Battle of Gallipoli. Bragg&#x27;s wife, Gwendoline, died in 1929.

Bragg played tennis and golf, and as a founding member of the North Adelaide and Adelaide University Lacrosse Clubs, contributed to the introduction of lacrosse to South Australia and was also the secretary of the Adelaide University Chess Association.

Bragg died in 1942 in England and was survived by his daughter Gwendolen and his son, Lawrence.

==Legacy==
The lecture theatre of King William&#x27;s College (KWC) is named in memory of Bragg; the Sixth-Form invitational literary debating society at KWC, the Bragg Society, is also named in his memory. One of the school &quot;Houses&quot; at Robert Smyth School, Market Harborough, Leicester, is named &quot;Bragg&quot; in memory of him being a student there. Since 1992, the Australian Institute of Physics has awarded The Bragg Gold Medal for Excellence in Physics for the best PhD thesis by a student at an Australian university. The two sides of the medal contain the images of Sir William Henry and his son Sir Lawrence Bragg.

The Experimental Technique Centre at Brunel University is named the Bragg Building. The Sir William Henry Bragg Building at the University of Leeds opened in 2021.

In 1962, the Bragg Laboratories were constructed at the University of Adelaide to commemorate 100 years since the birth of Sir William H. Bragg.

The Australian Bragg Centre for Proton Therapy and Research also in Adelaide, Australia was completed in late 2023. It is named for both father and son and offers radiation therapy for cancer patients.

In August 2013, Bragg&#x27;s relative, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, presented a BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Bragg on the Braggs&quot; on the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics winners.

<doc id="396462" wikidata="Q767010" url="?curid=396462" title="Party of the Democratic Revolution">
<text>The Party of the Democratic Revolution (, , PRD) is a state-level social democratic political party in Mexico (previously national, until 2024). The PRD originated from the Democratic Current, a political faction formed in 1986 from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The PRD was formed after the contested general election in 1988, which the PRD&#x27;s immediate predecessor, the National Democratic Front, believed was rigged by the PRI. This sparked a movement away from the PRI&#x27;s authoritarian rule.

As of 2023, the PRD was a member of the Fuerza y Corazón por México (Strength and Heart for Mexico) coalition. Internationally, the PRD was a member of the Progressive Alliance. The members of the party are known colloquially in Mexico as &quot;Perredistas&quot;. In 2024, the party failed to reach the necessary percentage of votes to keep its registration as a national political party.

==History==
===Early origins===

==== Break from the PRI (1986–1988) ====
The PRD had its origins with the leftist members of the PRI, Institutional Revolutionary Party. The PRI had dominated Mexican politics since its founding in 1929. In 1986, a group of PRI members – including Ifigenia Martínez, , Porfirio Muñoz Ledo, and Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas – formed the Democratic Current, a political faction within the PRI. 

The Democratic Current aimed to pressure the PRI to become a more democratic party and to address the issue of national debt including the social effects of the economic crisis that came from attempting to pay that debt. The Democratic Current was also against technocratization, in which the people in power had not held public office and were scholars who were often educated abroad. Under the Miguel de la Madrid presidency which lasted from 1982–1988, the PRI and Mexico were moving towards a technocracy especially since de la Madrid was a technocrat himself. The Democratic Current did not have many technocrats and was thus left out of the decision-making process. This political marginalization led the Democratic Current members to be more vocal about their concerns because they did not have a position of power to protect within the PRI.

After public criticisms and debate between the Democratic Current and the PRI, ten Democratic Current members signed Working Document Number One which was the official beginning of the Democratic Current. However, the PRI refused to acknowledge the Democratic Current as an organization unless they joined a union, which was allowed in the PRI. The forming of a group that was not united because of work but because of difference in ideology within the PRI caused fear of division within the party.

Once de la Madrid&#x27;s six-year term as president was coming to a close, the PRI chose six possible candidates for president and notably did not choose Cárdenas. The PRI had no process to apply as a candidate so Cárdenas could not run as a candidate for president. On 4 October 1987, Carlos Salinas de Gortari was ultimately chosen as the PRI candidate. Gortari did not embody anything that the Democratic Current wanted and many of the Democratic Current members left the PRI including Cárdenas during November 1987. Some Democratic Current members went on to support Cárdenas in his 1988 quest for presidency and help in the founding of the PRD.

====1988 presidential election====
On 12 October 1987, Cárdenas became the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution&#x27;s presidential candidate. Cárdenas still remained an independent candidate due to electoral laws which meant that many parties could choose Cárdenas as their candidate. The groups of the independent left that supported Cárdenas were the Mexican Socialist Party which included the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico, the Mexican Workers&#x27; Party, the Patriotic Revolutionary Party, the Communist Left Unity, and the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Movement. The parastatal groups, state-owned enterprises that are separate from government, that supported Cárdenas were the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, Popular Socialist Party, and the Party of the Cardenist Front of National Reconstruction, which made up the National Democratic Front. Other groups that supported Cárdenas were the Social Democratic Party, Ecologist Green Party of Mexico, Democratic Unity, , Critical Point Revolutionary Organization, and Neighborhood Assembly To provide a mechanism to coordinate and communicate with one another about campaign activities, these groups formed a coordinating body named the National Democratic Front (Mexico). The Mexican Socialist Party did not join in an official capacity, rather the party signed a separate pact with the Democratic Current.

In the 1988 presidential election, Cárdenas had come closer than any other political candidate to winning against the PRI, which had been in power since 1929. The victory of the PRI&#x27;s candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was largely considered guilty of electoral fraud in 1988; this was after the computers tabulating votes had reportedly crashed. As a result, Cárdenas claimed that he had won the election, although he never declared himself president. The National Democratic Front continued to support Cárdenas by signing a Declaration for the Defense of Popular Sovereignty. Protests erupted in support of Cárdenas, the largest of which occurred on 16 July and had an attendance of at least 300,000 people. Nonetheless, the election was ratified. Years later, it was determined that there was indeed electoral fraud in the election.

===Founding===
The 1988 election sparked a movement against the authoritarian rule of the PRI. As an integral part of the movement towards democracy, the Party of the Democratic Revolution was formed as Mexico&#x27;s only leftwing party. On 5 May 1989, Cárdenas declared the establishment of the PRD. Former PRI members who also helped found the PRD include: Cárdenas, Porfirio Muñoz Ledo, Ifigenia Martínez y Hernández and Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

The party was founded by smaller left-wing parties such as the Mexican Communist Party (PCM), Unified Socialist Party of Mexico (PSUM), Mexican Socialist Party (PMS) and Mexican Workers&#x27; Party (PMT). The PMS donated its registration with the Federal Electoral Commission (CFE) to enable the new party to be established.

=== First decade (1989–1999) ===
Small leftist group leaders joined the PRD which left small leftist organizations vulnerable. Additionally, some leftist organizations were wary that their concerns would be lost by joining a political group.

In the early years, the PRD was not successful in elections because of electoral fraud. The PRD often claimed that the PRI was participating in electoral fraud. This was in contrast to PAN, the conservative party, who chose to cooperate with the PRI. However, the PRD also cooperated with the PRI to make policy changes that moved towards democracy.

Salinas, PRI member and president of Mexico from 1988 to 1994, had made some improvements to the Mexican economy but Mexico still did not have a democratic system. During this time the PRD had become involved with many social justice movements against the neoliberal and antidemocratic policies of the PRI. The most famous of which was the party&#x27;s involvement with the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). Some members of the party wanted to strongly and publicly denounce the armed struggle, whereas others decided to emphatically approve the movement and its goals therefore, it was difficult to form a united front. Nonetheless, many PRD supporters also supported the EZLN and bolstered the movement through the use of posters and murals at PRD events. Although these instances portrayed the party to appear to be more radical than they were, Cárdenas himself took advantage of this support. He met with Subcomandante Marcos and did not attempt to distance the party from the EZLN. This support did not pay off as the EZLN did not help the PRD win any votes and Marcos accused the PRD of being the same as the PRI and PAN. The PRI labeled Cárdenas and the PRD as sympathizers of the EZLN and supporters of armed struggle. Additionally, the PRD had a difficult time transitioning from a movement with a non-negotiable goal to a party that pushed gradual reforms.

====1994 presidential election: Cárdenas====
Cárdenas ran for national presidency under the PRD in 1994. Cárdenas ran against Diego Fernández, PAN candidate, and PRI party winner of the election, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce. Cárdenas made the Alianza Democrática Nacional campaign, where he mobilized 57 organizations. Cárdenas did not cooperate well with the PRD and was sometimes contradictory to the PRD.

The PRI used its media influence to promote the idea that changing the governing party would disrupt the nation as well as to portray Cárdenas and the PRD as confrontational and violent.

After his loss, Cárdenas claimed fraud; however, the party did not support him and instead focused on winning seats in Congress.

====1994 presidential election aftermath====
In 1997, the PRD won its first governorship with Cárdenas as governor of Mexico City. The PRD also gained the second largest majority in the Chamber of Deputies. These victories were due in part to changes in electoral rules. These changes included the creation of the new Federal Elections Institute in 1990 which established six independent councilors who required legislative approval.

This division between currents was seen during the internal election of 14 March 1999 when there were voting discrepancies.

By the end of 1999, 650 members of the PRD had been assassinated, mostly by the PRI, as a way to intimidate those working towards democracy, civic engagement, and social movements.

=== Second decade (1999–2009) ===

====2000 presidential election: Cárdenas====
After the election of Vicente Fox, PAN candidate, the PRD announced that it would not file any complaints about the elections. This was a shift in strategy from the usual protests of fraud. However, some local PRD activist groups filed complaints but these were turned down by the PRD and the electoral court.

==== 2006 presidential election====
The former mayor of Mexico City, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was the presidential candidate for the &quot;Coalición por el Bien de Todos&quot; (Coalition for the Good of All) in the 2006 presidential elections. López Obrador ran against Felipe Calderón, PAN candidate, and Roberto Madrazo, PRI candidate.

López Obrador&#x27;s campaign relied on citizen&#x27;s networks (redes ciudadanas) that focused on mobilizing the public to campaign. This strategy focused on López Obrador as an individual and not the PRD. This was worrisome to PRD leaders because they thought that the PRD&#x27;s concerns would not be addressed. However, many party members thought that López Obrador would win so these concerns were not addressed.

After the general election of 2 July 2006 and a recount of the 9.09% of the ballot tally sheets which supposedly presented irregularities, the Federal Electoral Institute recorded the vote results in favor of Felipe Calderón by a margin of 0.58 percent, about 243,000 votes. These results were later validated by the Federal Electoral Tribunal. However, the PRD claimed that there was election fraud. The claims of election fraud have been rejected by the Federal Electoral Tribunal (TEPJF), which considered these &quot;notoriously out of order&quot; (&quot;notoriamente improcedente&quot;) and certified PAN&#x27;s candidate Felipe Calderón as the winner.
López Obrador then rallied his supporters to hold demonstrations in the capital, Mexico City. These demonstrations were organized by the PRD, whose stronghold is in Mexico City. The PRD had called for demonstrations and set up camps in the capital&#x27;s main square, blocking one of its main avenues (Paseo de la Reforma) for six weeks to demand a recount of all votes, which was not granted. The camps were later dismantled after a confrontation with the Mexican Army became likely.

On 5 September, the Federal Electoral Tribunal announced that there was not enough evidence of electoral fraud that legitimized Calderon as president. This caused López Obrador to maintain his campaign of civil disobedience and declared himself as &quot;Legitimate President&quot; in a &quot;public open vote&quot; (people in the main square raising their hands). López Obrador did not recognize the legitimacy of Calderón as president. The PRD was criticized for not complying with the democratic system that it had lauded and helped create. However, the PRD could not agree on whether they should move forward and cooperate with the current system and contribute to policy or take on an uncompromising stance in an attempt to overturn the current system. This split later trickled on to other things such as electoral and petroleum reforms where one part of the party wanted to cooperate while the other refused to out of allegiance to López Obrador.

In 2008, after bitter infighting within the party, Jesús Ortega, an opponent of Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was elected party president. In the 2009 legislative elections, López Obrador supported two smaller parties while maintaining his ties to the PRD.

====Videoscandals====
The party had enjoyed a reputation of honesty unmatched by its competitors, until the &quot;Video Scandals&quot; a series of videos where notable party members were taped receiving cash funds or betting large sums of money in a Las Vegas casino.

Later, another video was recorded by Cuba&#x27;s government where Carlos Ahumada, the man providing the money, states that members of the PRI and PAN, PRD&#x27;s rivals, were planning the situation presented in the first video as part of a plot against Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discredit him as a possible presidential candidate.

Party members who were seen on the videotapes were expelled from the party, but those who were supposedly associated, but never legally charged, are still active members.

=== Modern era (2009–present) ===

====2012 presidential election results====

López Obrador ran for president again in 2012, but lost to Enrique Peña Nieto.

After the loss, López Obrador told a rally in Mexico City&#x27;s main plaza Zocalo on 9 September 2012 that he would withdraw from the Democratic Revolution Party &quot;on the best of terms,&quot; as well as the Labor Party and Citizens&#x27; Movement (MC). He added that he was working on founding a new party from the Movement for National Regeneration, which he would later name MORENA.

====2018 presidential election: Ricardo Anaya====

The defeat of the PAN and the PRD in the Mexico general elections in 2012, as well as the departure of Andrés Manuel López Obrador from the PRD, caused these two parties to approach each other despite the friction obtained in the 2006 general elections.

In 2017, Ricardo Anaya, then President of PAN, announced his party&#x27;s proposal to create an alliance of politicians called &quot;Opposition Wide Front&quot; to &quot;form a coalition government that will result in a stable majority that can govern the country and make the change of regime a reality.&quot;

On 5 September, the PAN formalized an alliance with PRD and MC under the name of &quot;Citizen Front for Mexico,&quot; registering the coalition before the National Electoral Institute, an alliance to last for 6 years.

On 17 December, the three parties ratified the alliance with the creation of an electoral coalition to participate in the federal elections of 2018 and multiple state elections with the name of &quot;Por México al Frente.&quot;

==== 2018 presidential election aftermath ====
In August 2018, PRD abandoned &quot;Por México al Frente&quot;. In early 2019, the PRD split, with nine deputies leaving the PRD and joining Morena and the government coalition of López Obrador. This gave the government a two-thirds majority, allowing for the passage of constitutional reform.

On 22 December 2020, the PRD formed the new alliance &quot;Va por México&quot;, together with the National Action Party and the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

==== 2024 presidential election ====
In 2023, the PRD, along with the National Action Party and the Institutional Revolutionary Party formed the Fuerza y Corazón por México, an electoral alliance that competed in the 2024 Mexican general election with Xóchitl Gálvez as the coalitions’ presidential candidate against the Sigamos Haciendo Historia coalition’s candidate Claudia Sheinbaum of the Morena party. 

=== Dissolution at national level ===
Having lost the general election and failing to have achieved 3% of the national vote in the 2024 general election (in the election for president, Senate, nor Chamber of Deputies), the party lost its registration as a national party. It will remain registered as a state-level party and it can participate in the local elections of Aguascalientes, Baja California Sur, Guerrero, Mexico City, Michoacán, Morelos, Oaxaca, San Luis Potosí, Sonora, the State of Mexico, Tabasco, Tlaxcala and Zacatecas. On August 28, 2024, two remaining PRD senators-elect, Araceli Saucedo Reyes of Michoacán and José Sabino Herrera of Tabasco, switched their party affiliations to the Morena caucus ahead of the LXVI Legislature of the Mexican Congress.

===Economy===
The PRD, since its founding, believes that the state should have jurisdiction and should intervene in the fundamental and prioritized areas of the productive sector, such as nutrition, production of clean energy, telecommunications, the process of technology, infrastructure, communication mediums, financial systems, and technology trade for the national and regional development, restraining ownership and dominion of hydrocarbons and radio-electric spectrum for the nation and the recovery of basic goods that guarantee sovereignty.

===International scope===
The PRD supports the self-determination of communities, non-intervention, legal equality of states, the cooperation for national development and sovereignty, and the respect and incorporation of international treaties into legislation.

==Internal organization==
The PRD consists of: congresses, councils, and executive committees, an assembly, and a committee. The nation, states, and municipalities have the same organization. They each have a congress, a council, and an executive committee. Congress has the most authority, the council coordinates communication between congresses, and the executive committee applies the guidelines set in place by the council. The maximum rule for any elected position is three years. The national, state and municipal president cannot be reelected for the same position. The PRD has an anti-discriminatory policy for its internal elections. The PRD has policies put in place that guarantee the inclusion of women, young people, and indigenous people.

The National Congress is the maximum authority of the PRD. The National Congress approves the statue, the declaration of principles, the program, and the political organization of the party. 90% of the National Congress is made up of delegates elected in municipal assemblies. The rest of the National Congress is made up of two delegates for each State Council, the presidents of the State Councils, the members of the National Executive Committee, and the elected delegates of the National Council that shall not exceed 4% of the total delegates in the Party&#x27;s Congress. The National Council chooses the majority of its 21-member executive committee except for the president of the party, the secretary of the party, and the parliamentary group coordinators.

In 2014, the PRD became the first political party to have internal elections organized by the Federal Electoral Institute where those affiliated with the party could vote for the members of the National Congress and Council as well as State and Municipal Councils. 2 million people participated in the internal elections which is about 45% of those affiliated with the party.

<text>The Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York (CUNY Graduate Center) is a public research institution and postgraduate university in New York City. Formed in 1961 as Division of Graduate Studies at City University of New York, it was renamed to Graduate School and University Center in 1969. Serving as the principal doctorate-granting institution of the City University of New York (CUNY) system, CUNY Graduate Center is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;.

CUNY Graduate Center is located at the B. Altman and Company Building at 365 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. It offers 32 doctoral programs, 18 master&#x27;s programs, and operates over 30 research centers and institutes. The Graduate Center employs a core faculty of approximately 130, in addition to over 1,700 faculty members appointed from other CUNY campuses throughout New York City. As of fall 2025, the Graduate Center enrolls over 3,100 students, of which 2,600 are doctoral students. For the fall 2024 semester, 16.3% of applicants across all doctoral programs at the CUNY Graduate Center were offered admission.

The Graduate Center&#x27;s primary library, named after the American mathematician Mina Rees, is part of the CUNY library network of 31 colleges that collectively holds over 6.2 million volumes. Since 1968, the CUNY Graduate Center has maintained an agreement with the New York Public Library, which gives faculty and students increased borrowing privileges at NYPL&#x27;s research collections at the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. The Graduate Center building also houses the James Gallery, which is an independent exhibition space open to the public, and television studios for NYC Media and CUNY TV.

The faculty of the CUNY Graduate Center include recipients of the Nobel Prize, the Abel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, the National Humanities Medal, the National Medal of Science, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Rockefeller Fellowship, the Schock Prize, the Bancroft Prize, the Wolf Prize, Grammy Awards, the George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism, Guggenheim Fellowships, the New York City Mayor&#x27;s Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers, Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, and memberships in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Academy of Education.

==History==


CUNY began offering doctoral education through its Division of Graduate Studies in 1961, and awarded its first two PhD to Daniel Robinson and Barbara Stern in 1965. Robinson, formerly a professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford, received his Ph.D. in psychology, while Stern, late of Rutgers University, received her Ph.D. in English literature.

In 1969, the Division of Graduate Studies formally became the Graduate School and University Center. Mathematician Mina S. Rees served as the institution&#x27;s first president from 1969 until her retirement in 1972. Rees was succeeded as president of the Graduate Center by environmental psychologist Harold M. Proshansky, who served until his death in 1990. Provost Steven M. Cahn was named acting president in Spring 1991. Psychologist Frances Degen Horowitz was appointed president in September 1991. In 2005, Horowitz was succeeded by the school&#x27;s provost, Professor of English Literature William P. Kelly.

During Kelly&#x27;s tenure at the Graduate Center, the university saw significant growth in revenue, funding opportunities for students, increased Distinguished Faculty, and a general resurgence. This is in accordance with three primary goals articulated in the Graduate Center&#x27;s strategic plan. The first of these involves enhancing student support. In 2013, 83 dissertation-year fellowships were awarded at a total cost of $1.65 million. The Graduate Center is also developing new programs to advance research prior to the dissertation phase, including archival work. The fiscal stability of the university has enabled the chancellery to increase, on an incremental basis, the value of these fellowships. The packages extended for the 2013–14 years increase stipends and reduce teaching requirements. In 2001, the Graduate Center provided 14 million dollars in student support, and, in Fall 2013, 51 million in student support.

On April 23, 2013, the CUNY Board of Trustees announced that President Kelly would serve as interim chancellor for the City University of New York beginning July 1 with the retirement of Chancellor Matthew Goldstein. GC Provost Chase F. Robinson, a historian, was appointed to serve as interim president of the Graduate Center in 2013, and then served as president from July 2014 to December 2018.

Joy Connolly became provost in August 2016 and interim president in December 2018. Julia Wrigley was appointed as interim provost in December 2018. In July 2019, James Muyskens became interim president, as Connolly had been appointed president of the American Council of Learned Societies. On March 30, 2020, Robin L. Garrell, vice provost for graduate education and dean of graduate division at University of California, Los Angeles, was announced as the next president of the Graduate Center. She assumed office on August 1, 2020 and served until September 28, 2023.

Steve Everett assumed the position of provost and senior vice president in August 2021. Norman Carey succeeded him as interim provost in August 2024. 

Joshua Brumberg assumed the position of interim president on October 2, 2023. He was appointed president of the CUNY Graduate Center in June 2024. 

== Campus ==
The CUNY Graduate Center&#x27;s main campus is located in the B. Altman and Company Building at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. CUNY shares the B. Altman Building with the Oxford University Press. Before 2000, the Graduate Center was housed in Aeolian Hall on West 42nd Street across from the New York Public Library Main Branch. In 2017, the CUNY Advanced Science Research Center at 85 St. Nicholas Terrace in Manhattan&#x27;s Harlem neighborhood became part of the CUNY Graduate Center.

=== Advanced Science Research Center ===
The Advanced Science Research Center at the Graduate Center (CUNY ASRC) is an interdisciplinary STEM center for research and education. It covers five related fields: nanoscience, photonics, structural biology, neuroscience, and environmental science. The CUNY ASRC is located in a building on the southern edge of City College&#x27;s campus in Upper Manhattan. The CUNY ASRC, which opened in September 2014, is an outgrowth of CUNY&#x27;s &quot;Decade of Science&quot; initiative, a multibillion-dollar project to elevating science research and education.

The CUNY ASRC formally joined the CUNY Graduate Center in spring 2017. Today, the CUNY ASRC is one of the major pieces of CUNY&#x27;s citywide research network. Five years after the center opened, over 200 graduate, undergraduate, and high school students had been mentored by CUNY ASRC scientists. In that time, the center also hosted over 400 conferences, seminars, and workshops and awarded over $600,000 in seed grants to CUNY faculty.

==== Research initiatives ====
The CUNY ASRC was founded on the principle that researchers across different disciplines would collaborate to make scientific advancements. Thus, it consists of five related fields:

* Nanoscience: Exploring on the tiniest scale, using the living world for inspiration to create new materials and devices that advance fields ranging from biomedicine to energy production
* Photonics: Discovering new ways to control light, heat, radio waves, and sound for future optical computers, ultrasensitive cameras, and cell phone technology
* Structural biology: Combining physics and chemistry to explore biology at the molecular and cellular levels, with the intention of identifying new ways to treat diseases
* Neuroscience: Investigating how the brain senses and responds to environmental and social experiences, with a focus on neural networks, metabolic changes, and molecular signals occurring in brain cells, with the goal of developing biosensors and innovative solutions to promote mental health
* Environmental sciences: Developing high-tech, interdisciplinary solutions to urgent environmental challenges, including air and water issues, climate change, and disease transmission

Each research initiative occupies one floor of the CUNY ASRC building that hosts four faculty laboratories and between two and four core facilities.

==== Core facilities ====
The CUNY ASRC has 15 core facilities with a variety of equipment. These facilities are open to researchers from CUNY, other academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit companies from around the world.

The facilities include:

* Advanced Laboratory for Chemical and Isotopic Signatures (ALCIS) Facility
* Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Facility
* Comparative Medicine Unit (CMU)
* Epigenetics Facilities
* Imaging Facility
* Live Imaging &amp; Bioenergetics Facility
* MALDI Imaging Joint Facility
* Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Facility
* Macromolecular Crystallization Facility
* Mass Spectrometry Core Facility
* Nanofabrication Facility
* Next Generation Environmental Sensor (NGENS) Lab
* Photonics Core Facility
* Radio Frequency and mm-Wave Facility
* Surface Science Facility

====Education and outreach====

The CUNY ASRC has various scientific education programs. Students from CUNY&#x27;s community and senior colleges participate in research during the academic year and over the summer through programs such as the CUNY Summer Undergraduate Research Program. Graduate students from master&#x27;s and doctoral programs at the Graduate Center and from the Grove School of Engineering are members of CUNY ASRC research teams.

===== IlluminationSpace =====
The CUNY ASRC&#x27;s IlluminationSpace is an interactive education center, which accommodates high school field trips and provides free community hours. It has numerous virtual programs and resources.

The CUNY ASRC received a Public Interest Technology University Network 2021 Challenge Grant to establish the IlluminationSpace, STEM pathways, and science communications and outreach at CUNY. The funding is being used to increase participation of underrepresented demographic groups in STEM fields.

===== Community Sensor Lab =====
The CUNY ASRC Community Sensor Lab teaches high school students and community members how to build inexpensive, homemade sensors that can monitor aspects of the environment from the level of carbon dioxide and pollutants in the air to acidity in the soil and water.

==== Faculty opportunities ====
The CUNY ASRC offers a seed grant program to fund collaborative research that supports tenured and tenure-track faculty at CUNY colleges. The program started in 2015 and currently awards six one-year, $20,000 grants annually.

In addition, the center&#x27;s National Science Foundation CAREER Bootcamp Program, which guides tenure-track faculty through the proposal writing process, have helped CUNY researchers secure substantial NSF CAREER grants.

===== Grants and research =====
Between 2014 and 2019, CUNY ASRC researchers secured 126 grants totaling $61 million. Several recent grants have set records for CUNY and the CUNY Graduate Center. Faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students at the CUNY ASRC also hold several patents. Professor Kevin Gardner, director of the CUNY ASRC Structural Biology Initiative, was instrumental in the identification of hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF-2α) as a druggable target and the drug development efforts that led to the FDA-approved first-in-kind kidney cancer drug from Merck, belzutifan.

The CUNY ASRC is home to one of 15 Centers for Advanced Technology (CATs) designated by Empire State Development NYSTAR. Funded by a nearly $8.8 million grant, the CUNY ASRC Sensor CAT spurs academic-industry partnerships to develop sensor-based technology. Developing biomedical and environmental sensors is a particular focus, as is finding new approaches to sensing through photonics, materials, and nanoscience research.

Supported by a 2020 grant of up to $16 million from the Simons Foundation, a team of scientists led by Professor Andrea Alù, director of the CUNY ASRC Photonics Initiative, is studying wave transport in metamaterials. The team&#x27;s work could lead to greater sensing capabilities for the Internet of Things, improvements in biomedical applications, and extreme control of sound waves for medical imaging and wireless technology.

Professors Rein Ulijn and Andrea Al], the directors of the CUNY ASRC Nanoscience Initiative and the CUNY ASRC Photonics Initiative, each won a prestigious Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship from the U.S. Department of Defense, the agency&#x27;s highest-ranking single-investigator award. Alù&#x27;s $3 million fellowship, awarded in 2019, allowed him to develop new materials that enable extreme wave manipulation in the context of thermal radiation and heat management. Alù was also named the 2021 Blavatnik National Awards Laureate in Physical Sciences and Engineering. Ulijn&#x27;s $3 million fellowship, awarded in 2021, allowed him to research how complex mixtures of molecules acquire functionality and to repurpose this understanding to create new nanotechnology that is inspired by living systems.

=== Mina Rees Library ===

The Mina Rees Library, named after former president Mina Rees, supports the research, teaching, and learning activities of the CUNY Graduate Center by connecting its community with print materials, electronic resources, research assistance and instruction, and expertise about the complexities of scholarly communication. Situated on three floors of the CUNY Graduate Center, the library is a hub for discovery, delivery, digitization, and a place for solitary study. The library offers many services, including research consultations, a 24/7 online chat service with reference librarians, and workshops and webinars on using research tools.

The library also serves as a gateway to the collections of other CUNY libraries, the New York Public Library (NYPL), and libraries worldwide. It participates in a CUNY-wide book delivery system and offers an interlibrary loan service to bring materials from outside CUNY to Graduate Center scholars. The main branch of NYPL is just a few blocks north on Fifth Avenue, and NYPL&#x27;s Science, Industry and Business Library is just around the corner inside the B. Altman Building. CUNY Graduate Center students and faculty are NYPL&#x27;s primary academic constituents, with borrowing privileges from NYPL research collections. NYPL&#x27;s participation in the Manhattan Research Library Initiative (MaRLI) extends borrowing privileges for CUNY Graduate Center students to NYU and Columbia libraries as well.
The Mina Rees Library is a key participant in the CUNY Graduate Center&#x27;s digital initiatives. It supports the digital scholarship of students and faculty and promotes the understanding, creation, and use of open-access literature. Among its special collections is the Activist Women&#x27;s Voices collection, an oral history project focused on unheralded New York City community-based women activists.

=== Cultural venues ===
The CUNY Graduate Center houses three performance spaces and two art galleries. The Harold M. Proshansky Auditorium, named for the institution&#x27;s second president, is located on the concourse level and contains 389 seats. The Baisley Powell Elebash Recital Hall, located on the first floor, seats 180. The Martin E. Segal Theatre, also located on the first floor, seats 70.

Many departments are recognized internationally for their level of scholarship.

Courses in the social sciences, humanities, and mathematics, and courses in the sciences requiring no laboratory work convene at the Graduate Center. Due to the consortial nature of doctoral study at the CUNY Graduate Center, courses requiring laboratory work, courses for the clinical doctorates, and courses in business, criminal justice, engineering, and social welfare convene on CUNY college campuses.

=== Community ===
The CUNY Graduate Center pioneered the CUNY Academic Commons in 2009 to much praise. The CUNY Academic Commons is an online, academic social network for faculty, staff, and graduate students of the City University of New York (CUNY) system. Designed to foster conversation, collaboration, and connections among the 24 individual colleges that make up the university system, the site, founded in 2009, has quickly grown as a hub for the CUNY community, serving in the process to strengthen a growing group of digital scholars, teachers, and open-source projects at the university. The project has received awards and grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Sloan Consortium and was the winner of the 2013 Digital Humanities Award.

Also affiliated with the institution are four University Center programs: CUNY Baccalaureate for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies through which undergraduates can earn individualized bachelor&#x27;s degrees by completing courses at any of the CUNY colleges; the CUNY School of Professional Studies and the associated Joseph S. Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies; the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, which offers a master&#x27;s degree in journalism; and Macaulay Honors College.

==Research==
CUNY Graduate Center describes itself as &quot;research-intensive&quot; and is classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to be an R1 or have &quot;highest research activity&quot;. The CUNY Graduate Center&#x27;s primary library, named after Mina Rees, is located on campus; however, its students also have borrowing privileges at the remaining 31 City University of New York libraries, which collectively house 6.2 million printed works and over 300,000 e-books. Beginning in 1968, the CUNY Graduate Center maintains a formal collaboration with the New York Public Library that allows faculty and students access to NYPL&#x27;s extensive research collections, regular library resources, as well as three research study rooms located in the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. Further, , students have access to the libraries of Columbia University and New York University through the NYPL&#x27;s Manhattan Research Library Initiative.

=== American Social History Project ===
The American Social History Project/Center for Media and Learning (ASHP/CML) was established in 1981 to create and disseminate materials that help with understanding the diverse cultural and social history of the United States. Founded by Stephen Brier and Herbert Gutman, who sought to teach the history of everyday Americans, early projects included the film &quot;1877: The Grand Army of Starvation&quot;, about the 1877 railway strike.

ASHP has created curriculum grounded in the work of Howard Zinn, Herbert Gutman, and Stephen Brier which aims to teach social studies at the high school level with the inclusion of diverse viewpoints, including indigenous groups, enslaved Americans, immigrants, and the working class. Notable curricula and teaching tools have included &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Unfinished Revolution: An Inquiry into the Civil War and Reconstruction&quot;, and &quot;Who Built America?&quot; Other curriculum, such as &quot;Golden Lands, Working Hands,&quot; has focused on labor history; these types of ASHP materials emphasize collaborative teaching and learning strategies and have been popular in teaching districts that prioritize union labor.

Digital teaching resources created by ASHP have included the History Matters website and the online resource &quot;Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité: Exploring the French Revolution&quot;. As teaching tools, these websites place an emphasis on inclusion of primary source material for use in the classroom, alongside teaching strategies for seamless use of these documents in classroom curriculum. The online resource &quot;September 11 Digital Archive&quot; has received acclaim for its comprehensive representation of historic perspectives. ASHP is also a partner of the &quot;Mission US&quot; project and co-produced &quot;Mission US: Cheyenne Odyssey&quot;, an award-winning video game about a Cheyenne tribesman whose way of life is challenged by western expansion.

ASHP was established out of the success of a series of National Endowment for the Humanities summer seminars; seminar topics have included &quot;Learning to Look: Teaching Humanitites with Visual Images and New Media&quot;, &quot;Visual Culture of the American Civil War and its Aftermath&quot;, and &quot;LGBTQ+ Histories of the United States&quot;. This focus on professional development opportunities for educators has included other workshops such as the &quot;Bridging Historias: Latino/a History and Culture in the Community College Classroom&quot; program.

=== Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality ===
The James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality was launched on September 1, 2016. The Stone Center expanded and replaced the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Center, which opened its doors at the Graduate Center in 2009. It began a post-doctoral program in 2019.

The Stone Center has hosted several scholarly convenings. One year after its launch, it hosted the 2017 Meeting Of The Society For The Study Of Economic Inequality (ECINEQ). In 2021, it convened wealth inequality scholars for the two-day conference, &quot;From Understanding Inequality to Reducing Inequality.&quot;

==Notable people==
The CUNY Graduate Center has graduated 15,000 alumni worldwide, including numerous academics, politicians, artists, and entrepreneurs. As of 2016, the CUNY Graduate Center counted five MacArthur Foundation Fellows among its alumni, including writer Maggie Nelson as the most recent recipient.

== Student life ==
Some CUNY Graduate Center students live in Graduate housing in East Harlem. The eight-story building includes a gym, laundry facilities, lounge and rooftop terrace. The Graduate housing opened in fall 2011 in conjunction with the construction of the Hunter College School of Social Work.

The Doctoral and Graduate Students&#x27; Council (DGSC) is the sole policy-making body representing students in doctoral and master&#x27;s programs at the CUNY Graduate Center.

There are over forty doctoral student organizations ranging from the Middle Eastern Studies Organization and Africana Studies Group to the Prison Studies Group and the Immigration Working Group. These chartered organizations host conferences, publish online magazines, and create social events aimed at fostering a community for CUNY Graduate Center students.

Doctoral students at the CUNY Graduate Center also produce a newspaper funded by the DGSC and run by a committee of editors from the various doctoral programs. The paper, entitled &quot;The GC Advocate&quot;, comes out six times per academic year and is free for students, faculty, staff, and visitors.

<doc id="396466" wikidata="Q5084" url="?curid=396466" title="Hamlet (place)">
<text>A hamlet is a human settlement that is smaller than a town or village. This is often simply an informal description of a smaller settlement or possibly a subdivision or satellite entity to a larger settlement. Sometimes a hamlet is defined for official or administrative purposes.

The word and concept of a hamlet can be traced back to Norman England, where the Old French came to apply to small human settlements.

== Etymology ==
The word comes from Anglo-Norman &#x27;, corresponding to Old French &#x27;, the diminutive of Old French &#x27; meaning a little village. This, in turn, is a diminutive of Old French &#x27;, possibly borrowed from (West Germanic) Franconian languages. It is related to the modern French &#x27;, Dutch &#x27;, Frisian &#x27;, German &#x27;, Old English &quot;&quot;, and Modern English &quot;home&quot;.

== By country ==
=== Afghanistan ===
In Afghanistan, the counterpart of the hamlet is the qala (Dari: قلعه, Pashto: کلي) meaning &quot;fort&quot; or &quot;hamlet&quot;. The Afghan &quot;qala&quot; is a fortified group of houses, generally with its own community building such as a mosque, but without its own marketplace. The qala is the smallest type of settlement in Afghan society, outsized by the village (Dari/Pashto: ده), which is larger and includes a commercial area.

=== Canada ===
In Canada&#x27;s three territories, hamlets are officially designated municipalities. As of January 1, 2010:

* Northwest Territories had 11 hamlets, each of which had a population of less than 900 people as of the 2016 census;
* Nunavut had 24 hamlets, with populations ranging from 129 to 2,842 as of the 2016 census; and
* Yukon had two hamlets, both of which had a population of less than 450 people as of the 2016 census.

In Canada&#x27;s provinces, hamlets are usually small unincorporated communities within a larger municipality (similar to civil townships in the United States), such as many communities within the single-tier municipalities of Ontario, Alberta&#x27;s specialized and rural municipalities, and Saskatchewan&#x27;s rural municipalities.

Canada&#x27;s two largest hamlets—Fort McMurray (formerly incorporated as a city) and Sherwood Park—are located in Alberta. They each have populations, within their main urban area, in excess of 60,000—well in excess of the 10,000-person threshold that can choose to incorporate as a city in Alberta. As such, these two hamlets have been further designated by the Province of Alberta as urban service areas. An urban service area is recognized as equivalent to a city for the purposes of provincial and federal program delivery and grant eligibility.

=== France ===

A hamlet () is a group of rural dwellings, usually too small to be considered a village. The term is also applied to hamlets, but this can also refer to uninhabited localities.

During the 18th century, it was fashionable for rich or noble people to create their own &quot;hameau&quot; in their gardens. This was a group of houses or farms with rustic appearance, but in fact very comfortable. The best known are the Hameau de la Reine, built by the queen Marie-Antoinette in the park of the Palace of Versailles, and the Hameau de Chantilly, built by Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé in Chantilly, Oise.

=== Germany ===

The German word for hamlet is &quot;&quot; (). A &quot;Weiler&quot; has, compared to a &quot;Dorf&quot; (village), no infrastructure (i.e. no inn, no school, no store, no church). The houses and farms of a &quot;Weiler&quot; can be grouped (in the hills and the mountains) or scattered (more often in the plains). In North West Germany, a group of scattered farms is called &quot;Bauerschaft&quot;. In a Weiler, there are no street names, the houses are just numbered.

There is no legal definition of a hamlet in Germany. In Bavaria, like in Austria, a Weiler is defined as a settlement with 3 to 9 dwellings, from 10 houses it is called a village. A hamlet does not usually form its own administrative unit, but is part of a larger municipality.

=== India ===
In different states of India, there are different words for hamlet. In Haryana and Rajasthan, it is called &quot;dhani&quot; ( &#x27;) or &quot;Thok&quot;. In Gujarat, a hamlet is called a &quot;nesada&quot;, which are more prevalent in the Gir forest. In Maharashtra, it is called a &quot;pada&quot;. In southern Bihar, especially in the Magadh division, a hamlet is called a &quot;bigha&quot;. In state of Karnataka, a hamlet is known by different names like Palya, Hadi (Haadi), Keri, and Padi (Paadi). In olden days, the human population of hamlet was less than Halli (Village) or Ooru (Uru). But in the 20th century with tremendous increase in population, some of these hamlets have become villages, towns, cities or merged with them.

=== Indonesia ===

All over Indonesia, hamlets are translated as &quot;small village&quot;, or &#x27;. They are known as &#x27; in Central Java and East Java, &#x27; in Bali, &#x27; or &quot;&quot; in West Sumatra.

=== Netherlands ===
The Dutch words for hamlet are &#x27; or &#x27;. A &quot;gehucht&quot; or &quot;buurtschap&quot; has, compared to a &quot;dorp&quot; (village), no infrastructure (i.e. no inn, no school, no store) and contains often only one street, bearing the same name. The houses and farms of a &quot;gehucht&quot; or a &quot;buurtschap&quot; can be scattered. Though there are strong similarities between a &quot;gehucht&quot; and &quot;buurtschap&quot;, the words are not interchangeable. A &quot;gehucht&quot; officially counts as an independent place of residence (e.g. Wateren), while a &quot;buurtschap&quot; officially is a part of another place (e.g. Bartlehiem, part of Wyns).

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, a hamlet is called a &quot;gaaon&quot; گاؤں or mauza موضع in Urdu, &quot;giraaan&quot; گراں or &quot;pind&quot; پنڈ in Punjabi, and &quot;kalay&quot; کلې in Pashto. It is almost synonymous to &#x27;village&#x27;.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, the law recognises a number of different kinds of rural settlement. &quot;Przysiółek&quot; (which can be translated as &quot;hamlet&quot;) refers to a cluster of farms. &quot;Osada&quot; (which is typically translated as &quot;settlement&quot; but also can be translated as &quot;hamlet&quot;) includes smaller settlements especially differing by type of buildings or inhabited by population connected with some place or workplace (like mill settlements, forest settlements, fishing settlements, railway settlements, former State Agricultural Farm settlements). They can be an independent settlement, or a part of another settlement, like a village.

=== Romania ===
In Romania, hamlets are called &#x27; (singular: &#x27;), and they represent villages that contain several houses at most. They are legally considered villages, and statistically, they are placed in the same category. Like villages, they do not have a separate administration, and thus are not an administrative division, but are part of a parent commune.

=== Russia ===

In the Russian language, there are several words which mean &quot;a hamlet&quot;, but all of them are approximately equivalent. The most common word is деревня (&quot;derevnia&quot;, the word meant &quot;an arable&quot; in the past); the words село (&quot;selo&quot;, from the Russian word селиться (&quot;selit&#x27;tsa&quot;), meaning &quot;to settle&quot;) and посёлок (&quot;posiolok&quot;) are quite frequently used, too. Parallel to many other cultures, a distinction was often that &quot;selo&quot; has a church and &quot;derevnia&quot; has not.

The once common Russian word хутор (&quot;khutor&quot;) for the smallest type of rural settlement (arguably closest in nature to the English hamlet) is now mostly obsolete. The state of USSR wanted to have some form of basic infrastructure and central authority at each and every settlement. Obviously, this is the opposite of a hamlet - a place without either for being too small to meaningfully support those. Even without state pressure, once one of the neighboring &quot;khutor&quot;s got a permanent shop, school, community center (known in Russia as дом культуры, &quot;house of culture&quot;), maybe a medical post, others would naturally relocate closer, drawing together into one village.

Thus, the diminutive form деревенька (&quot;derevenka&quot;, tiny &quot;derevnia&quot;) is in widespread, albeit unofficial, use to denote such settlements, which mostly possess the amenities of a village yet the size of hamlet.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, a hamlet is called &quot;lugar&quot;, &quot;aldea&quot; or &#x27; (). The word comes from the Spanish term &#x27; («estate»). In the South of Spain, the term &quot; () is also used for designating small groups of rural dwellings or farmhouses.

A hamlet in Spain is a human settlement, usually located in rural areas, and typically smaller in size and population than a village (called in Spain, &quot; ). The hamlet is a common territorial organisation in the North West of Spain (Asturias, Cantabria and Galicia) dependent on a larger entity (e.g. parish or municipality).

In Spain, the hamlet is one of the categories in the official gazetteer of population entities. In the Royal Order and Instruction of the 8 of March 1930, issued for the elaboration of the Annual gazetteer, the hamlet (&quot;) is defined as the population entity with the smallest population and neighbourhood, usually more disseminated than the lugar, though its buildings can be also organised in streets and plazas.

=== Switzerland ===
In the four national languages, hamlets are known as &#x27; (German), &#x27; (French), &#x27; (Italian) and &#x27; (Romansh). A hamlet is always part of a larger municipality or may be shared between two municipalities. The difference between a hamlet and a village is that typically a hamlet lacks a compact core settlement and lacks a central building such as a church or inn. However, some hamlets (&quot;) may have grown up as an unplanned settlement around a church. There is no population limit that defines a hamlet and some hamlets have a larger population than some of the smallest municipalities. Generally there are no street names in a hamlet; rather, addresses are given by hamlet name and a number. House numbers might start at one side of the hamlet and continue to the other side or may have no clear organization.

A hamlet may form or have formed a &#x27; (legal place of citizenship regardless of where a person was born or currently lives) and may own common property for the &#x27;.

=== Turkey ===

In Turkey, a hamlet is known as a &quot;&quot; and denotes a small satellite settlement usually consisting of a few houses in the rural outskirts of a village.

=== Ukraine ===
In Ukraine, a very small village such as a hamlet usually is called a &quot;selyshche&quot; or &quot;&quot;. There also existed such places like &quot;volia&quot;, &quot;sloboda&quot;, &quot;huta&quot;, &quot;buda&quot;, and others.

=== United Kingdom ===
====England====

In England, the word &quot;hamlet&quot; (having the French origin given at the top of this article) means (in current usage) simply a small settlement, maybe of a few houses or farms, smaller than a village. However, traditionally and legally, it means a village or a town without a church, although hamlets are recognised as part of land use planning policies and administration. Historically, it may refer to a secondary settlement in a civil parish, after the main settlement (if any); such an example is the hamlet of Chipping being the secondary settlement within the civil parish of Buckland. Hamlets may have been formed around a single source of economic activity such as a farm, mill, mine or harbour that employed its working population. Some hamlets may be the result of the depopulation of a village; examples of such a hamlet are Graby and Shapwick. Because of the hilly topography of the parish, the village of Clent, situated on the Clent Hills, consists of five distinct hamlets.
====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, the common Irish place name element &#x27; is sometimes considered equivalent to the term &quot;hamlet&quot; in English, although &#x27; would actually have referred to what is known in English today as a &quot;townland&quot;: that is to say, a geographical locality rather than a small village.

====Scotland====
In the Scottish Highlands, the term &#x27;, of Gaelic derivation, may be preferred to the term &quot;hamlet&quot;. Also found in Scotland more generally is &#x27;, used in the specific case of a farm settlement, including outbuildings and agricultural workers&#x27; homes.

====Wales====
The term hamlet was used in Wales to denote a geographical subdivision of a parish (which might or might not contain a settlement). Elsewhere, mostly in England, these subdivisions were called &quot;townships&quot; or &quot;tithings&quot;. The Welsh word for &quot;hamlet&quot; is (also ). Both these words are diminutives of &quot;pentref&quot; (&quot;village&quot;) with the loose meaning of &quot;small village&quot;.

=== United States ===
==== Mississippi ====
In Mississippi, a 2009 state law (§ 17-27-5) set aside the term &quot;municipal historical hamlet&quot; to designate any former city, town, or village with a current population of less than 600 inhabitants that lost its charter before 1945. The first such designation was applied to Bogue Chitto, Lincoln County.

==== New York ====
In New York, hamlets are unincorporated settlements within towns. Hamlets are not legal entities and have no local government or official boundaries. Their approximate locations will often be noted on road signs, however, a specific service, such as water, sewer, or lighting to provide only that hamlet with services. A hamlet could be described as the rural or suburban equivalent of a neighborhood in a city or village. The area of a hamlet may not be exactly defined; it may be designated by the Census Bureau, or it may rely on some other form of border (such as a ZIP Code, school district or fire district for more urbanized areas; rural hamlets are typically only demarcated by speed zones on the roads serving them). Others, such as Forestville, New York, will be the remnants of former villages, with borders coextant with the previously defined borders of the defunct or dissolved village. Some hamlets proximate to urban areas are sometimes continuous with their cities and appear to be neighborhoods, but they still are under the jurisdiction of the town. Some localities designated as hamlets, such as Levittown in the Town of Hempstead, with a population of over 50,000, are more populous than some incorporated cities in the state.

==== Oregon ====

In Oregon, specifically in Clackamas County, a hamlet is a form of local government for small communities that allows the citizens therein to organize and co-ordinate community activities. Hamlets do not provide services, such as utilities or fire protection, and do not have the authority to levy taxes or fees. There are four hamlets in Oregon: Beavercreek, Mulino, Molalla Prairie, and Stafford.

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, a hamlet (&#x27;, &#x27;) is the smallest unofficial administrative unit. It is a subdivision of a commune or township (&quot;&quot;).

<text>Charles Glover Barkla (7 June 1877 – 23 October 1944) was an English physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1917 for his discovery of characteristic X-rays.

==Life==
Barkla was born in Widnes, England, to John Martin Barkla, a secretary for the Atlas Chemical Company, and Sarah Glover, daughter of a watchmaker.

Barkla studied at the Liverpool Institute and proceeded to Liverpool University with a County Council Scholarship and a Bibby Scholarship. Barkla initially studied Mathematics but later specialised in Physics under Sir Oliver Lodge. During the absence of Oliver Lodge due to ill health, Barkla replaced him in lectures.

In 1899 Barkla was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, with an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, to work in the Cavendish Laboratory under the physicist J. J. Thomson (discoverer of the electron). During his first two years at Cambridge, under the directions of Thomson, Barkla studied the velocity of electromagnetic waves along wires of different widths and materials.

After a year and a half at Trinity College, Cambridge, his love of music led him to transfer to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in order to sing in their chapel choir. Barkla&#x27;s voice was of remarkable beauty and his solo performances were always fully attended. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1903, and then his Master of Arts degree in 1907. He married Mary Esther Cowell in the same year, with whom he had two sons and one daughter.

In 1903 he studied secondary X-rays from gases radiated by other X-rays, developing a new experimental setup. This topic was relevant to the question of whether X-rays were indeed a type of electromagnetic radiation as many physicists suspected, because Lionel Wilberforce proposed to use these secondary rays to generate tertiary ones and prove the existence of polarization by rotating the detecting part of his experimental apparatus. Tertiary radiation was too feeble to measure, so Barkla assembled a slightly different setup. Using his new setup, he was able to prove that X-rays can indeed be polarized and are therefore electromagnetic. He published a brief summary of his findings in Nature in March 1904 and a more detailed account in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1905.

In 1913, after having worked at the Universities of Cambridge, Liverpool, and King&#x27;s College London, Barkla was appointed as a Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in 1913, a position he held until his death.

Barkla made significant progress in developing and refining the laws of X-ray scattering, X-ray spectroscopy, the principles governing the transmission of X-rays through matter, and especially the principles of the excitation of secondary X-rays. For his discovery of the characteristic X-rays of elements, Barkla was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1917. He was also awarded the Hughes Medal of the British Royal Society that same year.

Barkla proposed the J-phenomenon as a hypothetical form of X-ray behaviour similar to X-ray fluorescence. However, other scientists were not persuaded that this was a different mechanism from other known effects such as Compton scattering, so the theory was not successful.

From 1922 to 1938 he lived at Hermitage of Braid in south-west Edinburgh.

He died at 12 noon on 23 October 1944 at his home &quot;Braidwood&quot; in Corrennie Gardens in Edinburgh.

== Personal life ==
A religious man, Barkla was a Methodist and considered his work to be &quot;&quot;part of the quest for God, the Creator&quot;.&quot;

==Public recognition==

The lunar crater Barkla was named in the honour of Charles Barkla. 

A plaque exists on Barkla&#x27;s house at Hermitage of Braid in Edinburgh. A commemorative plaque has been installed in the vicinity of the Canongate, near the Faculty of Education Buildings, at the University of Edinburgh. Additionally, a lecture theatre at the University of Liverpool&#x27;s Physics department, as well as a Biophysics laboratory in the Biological science department, are named after him. In 2012 a gritter in Barkla&#x27;s home town of Widnes was named in his honour, following a competition run by the local newspaper. In Widnes they have a Retirement housing Complex named Barkla Fields after Charles.

<text>The Banger Sisters is a 2002 American comedy film written and directed by Bob Dolman, and produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures. The film stars Goldie Hawn as Suzette and Susan Sarandon as Vinnie; two middle-aged women who were once best friends and groupies, reveling in 1960s/70s hedonism, before they lost touch and went their very separate ways. Suzette&#x27;s decision to crash back into her former friend&#x27;s current, and radically different, conventionally respectable life, is the basis for humor, with the clash of who they were and now are. The plot considers aging and how people alter with time, whether incidentally - Suzette realizing she&#x27;s now older than the current musicians - or deliberately, to try to find a place in the world, as Vinnie has, but sometimes losing part of themselves along the way.

Released on September 20, 2002, the film was Dolman&#x27;s directorial debut, and Hawn&#x27;s last acting role until the release of &quot;Snatched&quot; in 2017, fourteen and a half years after the film&#x27;s release.

==Plot==
When Suzette is fired from her job as bartender at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles by a younger corporate manager with no time for nostalgia, she feels alone, aware of getting older, and in need of money, so on a whim sets out for Phoenix, Arizona to see former best friend, Vinnie. Stranded at a service station without money to buy gasoline, Suzette picks up neurotic, agoraphobic, middle-aged writer Harry Plummer, heading to Phoenix to permanently deal with his father&#x27;s negative influence over his life, and willing to pay for gas along the way.

On arrival in Phoenix, Suzette has a chance encounter with Vinnie&#x27;s 17-year-old elder daughter Hannah, who she finds collapsed and abandoned by her friends after a bad experience with LSD. Suzette brings her to Harry&#x27;s hotel room and cares for her, as Hannah starts throwing up. In the morning Suzette drives Hannah back to her parents&#x27; elegant suburban home, with a cover-story about the teenager having become ill after mixing red and white wine the previous night. But Suzette is shocked by what she sees, Vinnie - now Lavinia Kingsley - appears to be a radically different character to the one she knew 20 years ago; now with a conservative respectable lifestyle, portraying the conventionally &quot;perfect&quot; wife and mother—a role which prompts Vinnie&#x27;s younger daughter Ginger to ask Suzette, &quot;Did she &quot;ever&quot; do &quot;anything&quot; wrong?&quot;. Raymond, Vinnie&#x27;s lawyer husband and aspiring politician, is also unaware about his wife&#x27;s wilder past.

Initially horrified by Suzette&#x27;s sudden appearance, even attempting to bribe her to leave quietly, Lavinia starts to reminisce with Suzette, and warm to her presence. Lavinia cuts her hair and casts off her expensive but boring clothes and, just for one night, relives the &#x27;old days&#x27; by going dancing with Suzette. They return to Vinnie&#x27;s home, and down in the basement she retrieves some memorabilia of their previous life, including a collection of Polaroids of the penises of numerous &quot;musicians and a few roadies&quot;. They share a marijuana joint, which inadvertently sets off the smoke detector, waking up the household.

Ginger has a minor car accident, with everyone gathering at the hospital. Vinnie has an identity crisis during a family argument, where Hannah blames Suzette for disrupting their lives. Suzette leaves and calls Harry telling him she&#x27;s going back to Los Angeles. Vinnie follows Suzette and they have a heart to heart that ends up with them sitting atop a &quot;Got Milk?&quot; billboard sign to watch the sunrise.

The pair go to the hotel room to find Harry has left. Suzette fears the worst as Harry has taken a gun with him. They find Harry going to see his father - deceased in a cemetery. While Suzette tries to talk sense into Harry, Vinnie loses her patience and bumps into him with the car. Suzette takes the gun and shoots the single bullet into the air. Harry finally comes to grips with his dead, absentee father.

In the end, both Lavinia&#x27;s husband and her two daughters have understood that she is only human after all. In her graduation speech, Hannah speaks out against anything that is &quot;fake&quot; and urges her schoolmates, teachers and the parents present to &quot;do it true&quot;.

The following day, Suzette returns to Los Angeles together with Harry, who has come to consider her as his muse.

==Cast==
== Reception ==
The film was released on September 20, 2002. It opened at #2, in 2,738 theaters (setting a record as Fox Searchlight&#x27;s largest-ever theatrical release, which it would hold until their release of &quot;Ready or Not&quot; in 2019 at 2,820 theaters), grossing $10,037,846 during its opening weekend. It went on to gross $30,307,416 domestically and $7,760,937 from international markets, for a worldwide total of $38,068,353.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 48% based on reviews from 143 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Hawn and Sarandon are terrific together, but the hoary plot is predictable and contrived.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 48% based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 3 out of 4, calling it &quot;Pretty thin, but you grin while you&#x27;re watching it.&quot;

Hawn received a nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 60th Golden Globe Awards.

<text>Azie Taylor Morton (February 1, 1936 – December 7, 2003) was the Treasurer of the United States during the Carter administration from September 12, 1977, to January 20, 1981. She remains the only African American to hold that office. Her signature was printed on US currency during her tenure.

==Early life==
Morton was born to Fleta Hazel Taylor in a rural African-American enclave called the St. John Colony in the farming community of Dale, Texas. Taylor worked as a teacher at the Crocker School for Girls, a state-sponsored school for delinquents. Taylor was not deterred by these setbacks and began to work for change.

==Career==
Before becoming treasurer, Taylor served on President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. From 1972 to 1976, she was a special assistant to Robert Schwarz Strauss, the chair of the Democratic National Committee. Taylor was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

==Personal life==
Azie Taylor married James Homer Morton on May 29, 1965. The couple had two daughters, Virgie Floyd and Stacey Terry, who later brought them two granddaughters and four great-grandchildren. James Homer Morton died in January 2003.

==Death and legacy==
On December 6, 2003, Morton suffered a stroke at her home in Bastrop County, Texas, and she died of complications the next day.

In April 2018, Robert E. Lee Road in Austin was renamed Azie Morton Road in her honor.

<text>Victor Franz Hess (; 24 June 1883 – 17 December 1964) was an Austrian-American physicist who shared the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics with Carl David Anderson &quot;for his discovery of cosmic radiation&quot;.

== Biography ==
He was born to Vinzenz Hess and Serafine Edle von Grossbauer-Waldstätt, in , near Peggau in Styria, Austria, on 24 June 1883. His father was a royal forester in Prince Louis of Oettingen-Wallerstein&#x27;s service. He attended secondary school at Graz Gymnasium from 1893 to 1901.

From 1901 to 1905, Hess was an undergraduate student at the University of Graz. In 1910, Hess received his PhD from the University of Vienna. He worked as Assistant under Stefan Meyer at the Institute for Radium Research, Austrian Academy of Sciences, from 1910 to 1920.

In 1920, he married Marie Bertha Warner Breisky.

Hess took a leave of absence in 1921 and traveled to the United States, working at the United States Radium Corporation, in New Jersey, and as consulting physicist for the US Bureau of Mines, in Washington, D.C. In 1923, he returned to the University of Graz, and was appointed the ordinary professor of experimental physics in 1925. The University of Innsbruck appointed him professor, and director of the Institute of Radiology, in 1931.

Hess relocated to the United States with his Jewish wife in 1938, in order to escape Nazi persecution. The same year Fordham University appointed him professor of physics, and he later became a naturalized United States citizen in 1944. His wife died of cancer in 1955. The same year he married Elizabeth M. Hoenke, the woman who nursed Berta at the end of her life.

He was a practicing Roman Catholic, and in 1946, he wrote on the topic of the relationship between science and religion in his article &quot;My Faith&quot;, in which he explained why he believed in God. He retired from Fordham University in 1958 and he died on 17 December 1964, in Mount Vernon, New York from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

== Cosmic rays ==
Between 1911 and 1913, Hess undertook the work that won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. For many years, scientists had been puzzled by the levels of ionizing radiation measured in the atmosphere. The assumption at the time was that the radiation would decrease as the distance from the earth, the then assumed source of the radiation, increased. The electroscopes previously used gave an approximate measurement of the radiation but indicated that at greater altitude in the atmosphere the level of radiation might actually be higher than that on the ground. Hess approached this mystery first by greatly increasing the precision of the measuring equipment, and then by personally taking the equipment aloft in a balloon. He systematically measured the radiation at altitudes up to during 1911–1912. The daring flights were made both by day and during the night, at significant risk to himself.

The result of Hess&#x27;s meticulous work was published in the Proceedings of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and showed the level of radiation decreased up to an altitude of about , but above that the level increased considerably, with the radiation detected at , being about twice that at sea level. His conclusion was that there was radiation penetrating the atmosphere from outer space, and his discovery was confirmed by Robert Andrews Millikan in 1925, who gave the radiation the name &quot;cosmic rays&quot;. Hess&#x27;s discovery opened the door to many new discoveries in particle and nuclear physics. In particular, both the positron and the muon were first discovered in cosmic rays by Carl David Anderson. Hess and Anderson shared the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.

<text>Carl David Anderson (September 3, 1905 – January 11, 1991) was an American physicist who shared the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics with Victor Francis Hess for his discovery of the positron.

==Biography==
Anderson was born in New York City, the son of Swedish immigrants. He studied physics and engineering at Caltech (B.S., 1927; Ph.D., 1930). Under the supervision of Robert A. Millikan, he began investigations into cosmic rays during the course of which he encountered unexpected particle tracks in his (modern versions now commonly referred to as an Anderson) cloud chamber photographs that he correctly interpreted as having been created by a particle with the same mass as the electron, but with opposite electrical charge. This discovery, announced in 1932 and later confirmed by others, validated Paul Dirac&#x27;s theoretical prediction of the existence of the positron. Anderson first detected the particles in cosmic rays. He then produced more conclusive proof by shooting gamma rays produced by the natural radioactive nuclide ThC&quot; (208Tl) into other materials, resulting in the creation of positron-electron pairs. For this work, Anderson shared the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics with Victor Hess. Fifty years later, Anderson acknowledged that his discovery was inspired by the work of his Caltech classmate Chung-Yao Chao, whose research formed the foundation from which much of Anderson&#x27;s work developed but was not credited at the time.

Also in 1936, Anderson and his first graduate student, Seth Neddermeyer, discovered a muon (or &#x27;mu-meson&#x27;, as it was known for many years), a subatomic particle 207 times more massive than the electron, but with the same negative electric charge and spin 1/2 as the electron, again in cosmic rays. Anderson and Neddermeyer at first believed that they had seen a pion, a particle which Hideki Yukawa had postulated in his theory of the strong interaction. When it became clear that what Anderson had seen was &quot;not&quot; the pion, the physicist I. I. Rabi, puzzled as to how the unexpected discovery could fit into any logical scheme of particle physics, quizzically asked &quot;Who ordered &quot;that&quot;?&quot; (sometimes the story goes that he was dining with colleagues at a Chinese restaurant at the time). The muon was the first of a long list of subatomic particles whose discovery initially baffled theoreticians who could not make the confusing &quot;zoo&quot; fit into some tidy conceptual scheme. Willis Lamb, in his 1955 Nobel Prize Lecture, joked that he had heard it said that &quot;the finder of a new elementary particle used to be rewarded by a Nobel Prize, but such a discovery now ought to be punished by a 10,000 dollar fine.&quot;

Anderson spent all of his academic and research career at Caltech. During World War II, he conducted research in rocketry there. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1938. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. He received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1975. He died on January 11, 1991, and his remains were interred in the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. His wife Lorraine died in 1984.

<text>The Union for the Defence of the Republic ( ), after 1968 renamed Union of Democrats for the Republic ( ), commonly abbreviated UDR, was a Gaullist political party of France that existed from 1967 to 1976.

The UDR was the successor to Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s earlier party, the Rally of the French People, and was organised in 1958, along with the founding of the Fifth Republic as the Union for the New Republic (UNR), and in 1962 merged with the Democratic Union of Labour, a left-wing Gaullist group. In 1967 it was joined by some Christian Democrats to form the Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic, later dropping the &#x27;Fifth&#x27;. After the May 1968 crisis, it formed a right-wing coalition named Union for the Defense of the Republic (UDR); it was subsequently renamed Union of Democrats for the Republic, retaining the abbreviation UDR, in October 1968.

Under de Gaulle&#x27;s successor Georges Pompidou it promoted the Gaullist movement. It dissolved in 1976, and its successor was the Rally for the Republic (RPR) founded by Jacques Chirac.

<text>In tabletop games and video games, a character class is an occupation, profession, or role assigned to a game character to highlight and differentiate their capabilities and specializations.

In role-playing games (RPGs), character classes aggregate several abilities and aptitudes, and may also detail aspects of background and social standing, or impose behavior restrictions. Classes may be considered to represent archetypes, or specific careers. RPG systems that employ character classes often subdivide them into levels of accomplishment, to be attained by players during the course of the game. It is common for a character to remain in the same class for its lifetime; although some games allow characters to change class, or attain multiple classes. Some systems eschew the use of classes and levels entirely; others hybridize them with skill-based systems or emulate them with character templates.

In shooter games and other cooperative video games, classes are generally distinct roles with specific purposes, weapons, or abilities, with only tangential relation to the RPG context. Their differences may range from simple equipment changes, such as sniper classes armed with sniper rifles, to unique gameplay changes, such as medic classes that are tasked with healing and reviving injured allied players.

== History ==
&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;), the first formalized roleplaying game, introduced the use of classes, which were inspired by the units in miniature wargames such as &quot;Chainmail&quot;. Many subsequent games adopted variations of the same idea. These games are sometimes referred to as &#x27;class-based&#x27; systems. As well as tabletop games, character classes are found in many role-playing video games and live action role-playing games. Many of the most popular role-playing games, such as D20 system and White Wolf games still use character classes in one way or another. Most games offer additional ways to systematically differentiate characters, such as race or species, skills, or affiliations.

==In fantasy games and role-playing games==

In fantasy games, Fighter, Mage, and Thief form a common archetypal trio of basic classes, each ones&#x27; abilities offsetting the other&#x27;s weakness. The Fighter is strong and focuses on weapon-based combat, the Mage, renamed Wizard in later editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, is a ranged fighter equipped with a variety of magical abilities for combative and utilitarian purposes, and the Thief, renamed Rogue in later editions, is not physically strong but focuses on speed or stealth. Thus, it is usual to find one or more classes that excel in combat, several classes (called spell-casters) that are able to perform magic (often different kinds of magic), and one or more classes that deal with stealth.

In its original release &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; included three classes: fighting man, magic user, and Cleric (a class distinct from Mages or Wizards that channels divine power from deific sources to perform thaumaturgy and miracles rather than arcane magic drawn from cosmic sources to cast spells), while supplemental rules added the Thief class. In subsequent editions of the game, new classes were added individually, from spell-casting classes such as the Sorcerer, Warlock and Druid, to more combat-centered classes such as the Barbarian, Ranger and Monk, along with variant subclasses. 

In science fiction and other non-fantasy role-playing games, the role of magic user is often filled with a scientist or other intelligence-based class, while the Cleric becomes a medic or similarly supportive role, and the Rogue and/or Ranger with an explorer or assassin. Some science fiction and supernatural-themed RPGs also use psychic powers as a stand in for magic. There are also character classes that combine features of the classes listed above and are frequently called &quot;hybrid classes&quot;. Some examples include the Bard (a cross between the Thief and Mage with an emphasis on interpersonal skills, mental and visual spells, and supportive magical abilities), or the Paladin (a cross between the Fighter and Cleric with slightly decreased combat skills relative to a fighter but various innate abilities that are used to heal or protect allies and repel and/or smite evil opponents).

Some RPGs feature another variation on the classes mechanic. For example, in &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay&quot;, players choose a career. The career works like a class with abilities (known in WFRP as skills and talents) added to the character based on the chosen career. However, as the player advances and gains more experience he or she may choose a new career according to a predefined career path or change to a completely different career. WFRP is also notable in that characters are encouraged to roll to determine their starting career which is compensated for by free XP which can be spent on more skills.

As an alternative to class-based systems, skill-based systems are designed to give the player a stronger sense of control over how their character develops. In such systems, players can often choose the direction of their characters as they play, usually by assigning points to certain skills. Classless games often provide templates for the player to work from, many of which are based on traditional character classes. Many classless games&#x27; settings or rules systems lend themselves to the creation of character following certain archetypal trends. For example, in the role-playing video game &quot;Fallout&quot;, common character archetypes include the &quot;shooter&quot;, &quot;survivalist&quot;, &quot;scientist&quot;, &quot;smooth talker&quot; and &quot;sneaker&quot;, unofficial terms representing various possible means of solving or avoiding conflicts and puzzles in the game. GURPS, which inspired Fallout&#x27;s system, also used a classless system.

The original PlayStation 2 release of the role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; included a skill-based system in which as the player progressed, they would gain buffs and abilities (called licenses) via the game&#x27;s License Board (of which each party member shared). &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;&#x27;s re-release &quot;Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System&quot; and high-definition remaster, &quot;Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age&quot; changed this system by adding a class (or job) system in which classes could be changed, and they each had separate License Boards.

== In shooter games ==

Many multiplayer shooter games use class systems to provide different tactics and styles of play and promote teamwork and cooperation. These classes may only have differences through equipment, or they may feature notable gameplay differences. Most games do not allow players to use elements of multiple classes at the same time, though they typically allow players to switch classes before or during a match through a menu. Some games have progression systems for each individual class with class-specific unlockable items.

Examples of shooter games with classes include the &quot;Battlefield&quot; series, &quot;Star Wars Battlefront II&quot;, &quot;Rising Storm 2: Vietnam,&quot; and &quot;&quot;. All of these examples include a &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;support&quot; class, a less-mobile class armed with some sort of machine gun that is focused around suppressive fire and team support; they also include classes that are simply the standard rifleman class with additional unique equipment (such as &quot;demolitions&quot; classes, typically riflemen with additional explosive items).

One notable example is the 2007 team-based shooter &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, which features nine distinct classes divided into three categories: Offense, Defense, and Support. Offense classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro) specialize in assaulting and overwhelming enemies to complete objectives; Defense classes (Demoman, Heavy, Engineer) specialize in defending positions and hindering enemy advances; and Support classes (Medic, Sniper, Spy) specialize in assisting their team in different ways. Each of these classes feature notable gameplay differences that are meant to suit their categories, yet do not limit them from being used for both offense and defense playstyles to varying degrees of effectiveness. They also all have strengths and weaknesses in a rock paper scissors-esque style; for example, the Spy is strong against slow or sedentary classes such as the Heavy and Sniper, with equipment that specifically counters the Engineer&#x27;s constructions, but his stealth abilities are nullified by the Pyro&#x27;s fire, and he is impractical against more mobile classes such as the Scout. Each class is also treated as its own character, with unique personalities, backstories, and interactions with other classes.

A derivative of these types of classes are seen in hero shooters, where each hero has distinct abilities and weapons that often combine archetypical conventional classes or are unique on their own.

<doc id="396493" wikidata="Q1631830" url="?curid=396493" title="1973 Irish general election">
<text>The 1973 Irish general election to the 20th Dáil was held on Wednesday, 28 February 1973, following the dissolution of the 19th Dáil on 5 February by President Éamon de Valera on the request of Taoiseach Jack Lynch. The general election took place in 42 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 144 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas. 

Fianna Fáil, led by Taoiseach Jack Lynch, had won the previous three elections and maintained a dominant position in Irish politics since 1957. However, the 1973 election saw the first successful challenge to their power in over a decade. A pre-election pact between Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed the National Coalition, which presented a united front to the electorate for the first time in 16 years.

The election campaign was highly competitive, focusing on issues like national security, social welfare, and rising living costs. Despite Fianna Fáil increasing its share of the vote, it lost seats, leaving them with 69 seats. In contrast, the National Coalition gained a narrow majority, with Fine Gael securing 54 seats and Labour 19, giving the coalition a combined total of 73 seats.

Afterwards, the 20th Dáil met at Leinster House on 4 March to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Liam Cosgrave was appointed Taoiseach, forming the 14th government of Ireland, a coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.

==Background==
By the time the 1973 general election was called, Fianna Fáil had held power for nearly sixteen years, a period that had seen the leadership transition from Éamon de Valera to Seán Lemass, and from Lemass to Jack Lynch in 1966. Although Lynch had initially hoped to dissolve the Dáil in December 1972, political events led to the election being delayed until February 1973.

==Campaign==
This election was marked by a significant shift in the Irish political landscape, as Fine Gael and Labour, having spent years as separate opposition parties, decided to unite under the National Coalition banner. This pact, the first of its kind in Ireland in 16 years, was a strategic attempt to challenge Fianna Fáil’s dominance. Both parties campaigned on shared issues such as economic challenges, rising prices, social welfare reforms, national security, and unemployment: issues that resonated strongly with voters feeling the strain of rising inflation and other economic pressures.

The National Coalition was able to present itself as a credible alternative to Fianna Fáil’s long-standing rule. Fianna Fáil, on the other hand, despite holding a strong position with 75 seats, faced criticism for its handling of various issues, including national security and economic performance. The campaign also saw significant attention on the ongoing Troubles in Northern Ireland, which influenced the national discourse, though the National Coalition sought to distance itself from Fianna Fáil’s record on the issue.

In the weeks leading up to election day, Jack Lynch’s Fianna Fáil struggled to galvanise a strong campaign narrative. The opposition parties were particularly effective in criticising Fianna Fáil’s handling of the economy and social issues, while Fine Gael and Labour worked together to highlight the government’s shortcomings and present a united, fresh alternative.

On the ground, the National Coalition campaign was highly organised, and the message was clear: the time had come for change. The Labour Party, in particular, found success in areas where they had previously been weak, such as in Cork, where they made strong gains in constituencies like Cork Mid where Eileen Desmond topped the polls. In contrast, Fianna Fáil, despite increasing its overall vote share, found itself losing crucial seats across the country, a result of the finely balanced nature of the single transferable vote system, where transfers played a crucial role.

The campaign was also heavily focused on cost-of-living concerns, with rising prices becoming one of the key talking points. This reflected wider dissatisfaction with Fianna Fáil’s economic policies and management, even as the party maintained its stronghold in some rural areas. Fine Gael and Labour made gains in Dublin, while Fianna Fáil&#x27;s grip on urban areas began to slip.

==Challenge on voting age==
The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, approved in a referendum in December 1972 and signed into law in January 1973, had reduced the voting age from 21 to 18. However, the electoral register would not be updated until 15 April, five weeks after the election date. A 20-year-old student, represented by Seán MacBride, sought an injunction from the High Court postponing the election to vindicate his right to vote. He lost his case, although he was awarded his costs due to its &quot;public importance&quot;.

==Result==
The election day itself, February 28, 1973, saw a high level of voter turnout, with reports indicating that the result could hinge on just a few seats. The &quot;Evening Echo&quot;, reporting on the day, noted that the election had been one of the hardest-fought in recent years, with both sides campaigning vigorously on issues like prices, social welfare, jobs, and national security. The public’s engagement in the campaign was intense, with the results expected to be tight and possibly decided in the transfer of votes.

Lynch, by now facing the growing realisation that the election might not go in Fianna Fáil’s favour, continued to campaign hard. He personally cast his vote early in the morning at Rathgar National School in Dublin, joined by his wife. Fine Gael’s leader, Liam Cosgrave, did likewise, casting his vote at Ballyroane National School in Rathfarnham. The mood of the campaign in these final days was tense, with both sides unsure about how the votes would finally play out.

As votes were counted in the days that followed, it became clear that while Fianna Fáil had gained in terms of the percentage of the vote, it was not enough to maintain its dominance. Despite the increased support, the distribution of votes across constituencies, combined with the transfer system, ensured that the National Coalition could seize power. Jack Lynch, despite being hopeful for a win in the early stages, was the first Taoiseach to concede defeat live on television during an interview with RTÉ’s Brian Farrell.

In the end, Fine Gael and Labour’s combined total of 73 seats gave them a slim majority, and the National Coalition emerged victorious after a bitter and hard-fought campaign. The campaign had been marked by an effective opposition strategy that capitalised on Fianna Fáil’s vulnerabilities, and the pact between Fine Gael and Labour proved to be a decisive factor in the outcome.

<text>:&quot;Otto Stern was also the pen name of German women&#x27;s rights activist Louise Otto-Peters (1819–1895)&quot;.
Otto Stern (; 17 February 1888 – 17 August 1969) was a German-American physicist and Nobel laureate in Physics. He was the second most nominated physicist for a Nobel Prize, with 82 nominations in the years 1925–1945 (most times nominated is Arnold Sommerfeld with 84 nominations), ultimately winning in 1943.

==Biography==
Stern was born into a Jewish family in Sohrau (now Żory) in the Province of Silesia, the German Empire&#x27;s Kingdom of Prussia. His father was Oskar Stern (1850–1919), a mill owner, who had been living in Breslau (now Wrocław) since 1892. His mother Eugenia née Rosenthal (1863–1907) was from Rawitsch (now Rawicz) in the Prussian Province of Posen. Otto Stern had a brother, Kurt, who became a noted botanist in Frankfurt, and three sisters. He studied in Freiburg im Breisgau, Munich and Breslau.

Stern completed his studies at the University of Breslau in 1912 with a doctoral dissertation in physical chemistry under supervision of Otto Sackur on the kinetic theory of osmotic pressure in concentrated solutions. He then followed Albert Einstein to Charles University in Prague and in 1913 to ETH Zurich. Stern served in World War I doing meteorological work on the Russian front while still continuing his studies and in 1915 received his Habilitation at the University of Frankfurt. In 1921 he became a professor at the University of Rostock which he left in 1923 to become director of the newly founded &quot;Institut für Physikalische Chemie&quot; at the University of Hamburg.

In 1930, Stern received an LL.D. degree from Berkeley, where he was a frequent visiting professor during the 1930s, becoming close colleagues with members of the Berkeley faculty, including chemistry dean Gilbert Lewis, whom Stern would nominate for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1933. After resigning from his post at the University of Hamburg in 1933 because of the Nazis&#x27; Machtergreifung (seizure of power), he found refuge in the city of Pittsburgh becoming a professor of physics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology.

As an experimental physicist Stern contributed to the discovery of spin quantization in the Stern–Gerlach experiment with Walther Gerlach in February 1922 at the Physikalischer Verein in Frankfurt am Main. With his life-long collaborator Immanuel Estermann, he demonstrated of the wave nature of atoms and molecules; measurement of atomic magnetic moments; discovery of the proton&#x27;s magnetic moment; and development of the molecular beam method which is utilized for the technique of molecular beam epitaxy.

He was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize in Physics, the first to be awarded since 1939. It was awarded to Stern alone, &quot;for his contribution to the development of the molecular ray method and his discovery of the magnetic moment of the proton&quot; (not for the Stern–Gerlach experiment). The 1943 prize was actually awarded in 1944.

Stern was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1945 and the American Philosophical Society in 1946.

After Stern retired from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, he moved to Berkeley, California. He was a regular visitor to the physics colloquium at Berkeley. He died of a heart attack in Berkeley on 17 August 1969.

The Stern-Gerlach-Medaille of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft awarded for excellence in experimental physics is named after him and Gerlach.

His niece was the crystallographer Lieselotte Templeton.

<text>Roden Berkeley Wriothesley Noel, also known as &quot;Noël&quot; (27 August 1834 – 26 May 1894), was an English poet. He was a Cambridge Apostle.

==Early life ==
He was the youngest son of Charles Noel, 1st Earl of Gainsborough and, his fourth wife, Lady Frances Jocelyn. His only full sibling was Lady Victoria Noel, who married Sir Fowell Buxton, 3rd Baronet, later Governor of South Australia. From his father&#x27;s earlier marriages, he had several half-siblings including Charles Noel, 2nd Earl of Gainsborough (who married Lady Ida Harriet Augusta, a daughter of William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll and Elizabeth FitzClarence, an illegitimate daughter of King William IV), Gerard James Noel, MP, Capt. Henry Lewis Noel, Lady Mary Arabella Louisa Noel (wife of Sir Andrew Agnew, 8th Baronet), and Lady Catherine Hamilton Noel (the first wife of James Carnegie, 9th Earl of Southesk).

His mother was the second daughter of Robert Jocelyn, 3rd Earl of Roden, and the former Maria Catherine Stapleton (a daughter of Thomas Stapleton, 15th Baron Despencer). His paternal grandparents were Sir Gerard Noel, 2nd Baronet and Diana Noel, 2nd Baroness Barham (who succeeded her father as second Baroness Barham in 1823).

Noel was educated at Windlesham House School, Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained his M.A. in 1858. He then spent two years travelling in the East. From 1867 to 1871, he served as a Groom of the Privy Chamber.
==Career==
Roden Noel&#x27;s versification was unequal and sometimes harsh, but he has a genuine feeling for nature, and the work is permeated by philosophic thought.

His other works include a drama in verse, &quot;The House of Ravensburg&quot; (1877), an epic on David Livingstone&#x27;s expedition in Africa, a &quot;Life of Byron&quot; (1890, Great Writers series), an edition of Edmund Spenser&#x27;s poems, a selection of Thomas Otway&#x27;s plays (1888) for the Mermaid series, and critical papers on literature and philosophy.

His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; were edited (1902) by his sister, Lady Victoria Buxton, with a notice by John Addington Symonds, which had originally appeared in the &quot;Academy&quot; (January 19, 1899) as a review of &quot;The Modern Faust&quot;. The selection (1892) in the series of Canterbury Poets has an introduction by Robert Buchanan.

His poem &quot;Sea Slumber Song&quot; was set to music by Sir Edward Elgar as the first song of his song-cycle &quot;Sea Pictures&quot;.

Noel was a spiritualist and interested in parapsychology. He was a founding vice-president of the Society for Psychical Research.

==Personal life==
In 1863, he married Alice Maria Caroline de Broë, daughter of Paul de Broë, the director of the Ottoman Bank in Beirut. Their third child, Eric, who died aged five, is commemorated in Roden Noel&#x27;s best-known book of verse, &quot;A Little Child&#x27;s Monument&quot; (1881).

The latter part of his life was spent at Brighton, but he died in the train station of Mainz in Germany. His son Conrad Noel became a Christian Socialist, famous as the &quot;turbulent priest of Thaxted&quot;. After his death, his widow Alice married the Rev. David MacAnally in 1895.

<text>Rudolf Emil Kálmán (May 19, 1930 – July 2, 2016) was a Hungarian-American electrical engineer, mathematician, and inventor. He is most noted for his co-invention and development of the Kalman filter, a mathematical algorithm that is widely used in signal processing, control systems, and guidance, navigation and control. For this work, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Kálmán the National Medal of Science on October 7, 2009.

==Life and career==
Rudolf Kálmán was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1930 to Otto and Ursula Kálmán (née Grundmann). After emigrating to the United States in 1943, he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1953 and his master&#x27;s degree in 1954, both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in electrical engineering. Kálmán completed his doctorate in 1957 at Columbia University in New York City.

Kálmán worked as a Research Mathematician at the Research Institute for Advanced Studies in Baltimore, Maryland, from 1958 until 1964. He was a professor at Stanford University from 1964 until 1971, and then a Graduate Research Professor and the Director of the Center for Mathematical System Theory, at the University of Florida from 1971 until 1992. He periodically returned to Fontainebleau from 1969 to 1972 at MINES ParisTech where he served as scientific advisor for Centre de recherches en automatique. Starting in 1973, he also held the chair of Mathematical System Theory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland.

Kálmán died on the morning of July 2, 2016, at his home in Gainesville, Florida.

==Work==
Kálmán was an electrical engineer by his undergraduate and graduate education at MIT and Columbia University, and he was noted for his co-invention of the Kalman filter (or Kalman-Bucy Filter), which is a mathematical technique widely used in the digital computers of control systems, navigation systems, avionics, and outer-space vehicles to extract a signal from a long sequence of noisy or incomplete measurements, usually those done by electronic and gyroscopic systems.

Kálmán&#x27;s ideas on filtering were initially met with vast skepticism, so much so that he was forced to do the first publication of his results in mechanical engineering, rather than in electrical engineering or systems engineering. Kálmán had more success in presenting his ideas, however, while visiting Stanley F. Schmidt at the NASA Ames Research Center in 1960. This led to the use of Kálmán filters during the Apollo program, and furthermore, in the NASA Space Shuttle, in Navy submarines, and in unmanned aerospace vehicles and weapons, such as cruise missiles. 

Kálmán published several seminal papers during the sixties, which rigorously established what is now known as the state-space representation of dynamical systems. He introduced the formal definition of a system, the notions of controllability and observability, eventually leading to the Kalman decomposition. Kálmán also gave groundbreaking contributions to the theory of optimal control and provided, in his joint work with J. E. Bertram, a comprehensive and insightful exposure of stability theory for dynamical systems. He also worked with B. L. Ho on the minimal realization problem, providing the well known Ho-Kalman algorithm.

==Awards and honors==
Kálmán was a foreign member of the French, Hungarian and Russian Academies of Sciences, as well as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has been awarded many honorary doctorates from other universities. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

Kálmán received the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1974, the IEEE Centennial Medal in 1984, the Inamori foundation&#x27;s Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology in 1985, the Steele Prize of the American Mathematical Society in 1987, the Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award in 1997, and the National Academy of Engineering&#x27;s Charles Stark Draper Prize in 2008.

Kálmán also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1990. and an Honorary doctorate from the Politecnico di Milano in 2012. Kalman died a few weeks before the conferment of the latter doctorate, so that his wife Dina attended the ceremony on his behalf, held in the Conference room of the Departement of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering of the Politecnico di Milano on 12 September 2016.

<text>Willenhall is a market town in the Walsall district, in the county of the West Midlands, England, with a population taken at the 2021 Census of 49,587. It is situated between Wolverhampton and Walsall, historically in the county of Staffordshire. It lies upon the River Tame, and is contiguous with both Wolverhampton and parts of South Staffordshire. The M6 motorway at Junction 10 separates it from Walsall.

The town is historically famous for the manufacture of locks and keys. As early as 1770, Willenhall contained 148 skilled locksmiths and its coat of arms reflects the importance of this industry to its growth. It was home to the National Union of Lock and Metal Workers from 1889 until 2004. Its motto is &quot;Salus Populi Suprema Lex&quot; – The welfare of the people is the highest law.

The urban district of Willenhall (established by the Local Government Act 1894) was partitioned in 1966 between the county boroughs of Walsall and Wolverhampton (since 1974 the metropolitan boroughs of Walsall and Wolverhampton).

The northern border of Willenhall has always been adjoining open land, although the extent of Willenhall&#x27;s expansion has meant in the last hundred years its northern border has been moved by about two miles.

== History ==
Willenhall has been described as &quot;undoubtedly a place of great antiquity, on the evidence of its name it manifestly had its origins in an early Saxon settlement. The Anglo-Saxon form of its name Willanhale may be interpreted as &#x27;the meadow land of Willa&#x27; – Willa being a personal name.&quot; Alternatively, the name may mean &quot;willow halh&quot;, the first element of it being the Old English &quot;wilgen&quot; &#x27;of willows&#x27;. The Old English word &quot;halh&quot; meaning &quot;a nook or corner of land, &quot;often used of land in a hollow or river bend&quot;.&quot;

The first record of the settlement of Willenhall is from the eighth century when a treaty was signed there by King Ethelbald of Mercia, in which Willenhall was referred to as &quot;Willenhalch&quot;. In 996 the town was referred to as &quot;Willenhale&quot;, and as &quot;Winenhale&quot; it was mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086) as a very small settlement, and it remained so until the growth of industry in the 18th century.

During the 10th century, Willenhall was in the Shire of Stafford and The Hundred of Offlow (unit of a 100 villages), consisting of 30 households and a population of around 120. In the Middle Ages, Willenhall was included in the parish of St. Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton. Although there was a church in the village, people would have to travel to Wolverhampton for weddings and funerals. It was not until 1840 that Willenhall had a parish church. St. Giles was the first church to be built. The present church is the third on the site, dating from 1867. The River Tame flows through the churchyard and was until recent years one of the few places where the water surfaced.

Willenhall was a small agricultural village throughout the Middle Ages. From Tudor times, the natural mineral wealth began to be exploited with ore being sent out to charcoal furnaces in nearby Cannock Chase. The iron product was then returned to be turned into small metal goods. Nails were a common product and by the end of 17th century Willenhall had a healthy hand trade, making grid irons, curry combs, bolts, latches and coffin handles. According to the Hearth Tax Returns in 1665, Willenhall comprised 136 households and 894 persons. The population did not increase dramatically until the 18th century when iron and coal began to be fully exploited. The town grew up around the Market Place and Stafford Street with many tiny streets crammed with houses, workshops and pubs. Evidence of the town&#x27;s growing prosperity is still visible today in the Dale House, once the home of the Hincks family, and 33 Market Place, the home of the Clemsons, both maltsters.

Willenhall suffered its very own great fire in 1659, when most of the town centre was devastated. Most common homes at this time were still made of wattle and daub with glassless wind-eyes (windows), properties easily razed by fire. Rebuilding where money allowed was in brick; The Bell Inn Public House being a good surviving example from 1660, although now closed for business and in the ownership of a local heritage trust (the Willenhall Townscape Heritage Initiative).

Willenhall&#x27;s first workhouse opened in 1741 adjacent to what is now Upper Lichfield Street; it was in operation for 100 years before merging with Wolverhampton. By 1801, the population was 3,143.

Poor housing and lack of any proper sanitation led to a cholera epidemic in 1849 when 292 people died. Many of those who died were buried in the Cholera Burial Ground &quot;on land at the bottom of Doctors Piece.&quot; A commemorative plaque at the site reads:THE PARISH OF WILLENHALL WAS VISITED BY CHOLERA IN 1849.THE FIRST DEATH BY THAT DISEASE TOOK PLACE ON THE 17TH AUGUST, THE LAST ON 4TH OCTOBER. IN 49 DAYS 292 PERSONS DIED, THE CHURCHYARD OF ST GILES BEING TOO CROWDED FOR FURTHER INTERMENT, THIS GROUND, A PORTION OF THE CHURCH ESTATE WAS (WHILE YET UNCONSECRATED) FIRST USED FOR BURIALS ON THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER. ON THREE DAYS THE BURIALS WERE 15 DAILY THE WHOLE NUMBER INTERRED HERE AND IN THE CHURCHYARD BEING 211.

The epidemic shocked the town into improving conditions, and in 1854 the Willenhall Local Board of Health was founded: to reflect a growth in civic pride, it established a library building in Clemson Street in 1866. The board was a forerunner of Willenhall Urban District Council which took over in 1894.
The clock in the Market Place was erected in 1892 by public subscription to the memory of Joseph Tonks, who was a doctor working in the town post-cholera. About the clock, Hackwood writes: This was erected, as an inscription upon it testifies, as a memorial to the late Joseph Tonks, surgeon. &quot;whose generous and unsparing devotion in the cause of alleviating human suffering&quot; was &quot;deemed worthy of public record.&quot; 

Tonks brought both health and sanitation to Willenhall but died at the age of 35.

Willenhall was formerly a township in the parish of Wolverhampton, in 1866 Willenhall became a separate civil parish, in 1894 Willenhall became an urban district, the district contained the civil parish of Willenhall and from 1934 the parish of Short Heath. On 1 April 1966 the district was abolished and merged with the County Borough of Walsall and the County Borough of Wolverhampton, part also went to Cannock Rural District. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with Walsall, Wolverhampton and Essington. In 1961 the parish had a population of 32,352.

===20th century===

By 1901, the population of &quot;Willenhall, minus Short Heath&quot; was 18,515.

Football came to Willenhall on 4 September 1905 when Spring Bank Stadium was opened in Temple Road, serving Willenhall Swifts F.C., whose first opponents in a friendly at the stadium were the Football League side Birmingham City. The club merged with Willenhall Pickwicks in 1919 to form Willenhall F.C., who achieved swift success as Birmingham and District League champions in 1922. However, the club soon fell into financial problems and went into liquidation in 1930. Spring Bank Stadium was sold and converted into a greyhound track, which remained open until 1980. It was demolished soon afterwards and replaced by housing.

Football returned to Willenhall in 1953 with the formation of Willenhall Town F.C., who played at a site on Noose Lane until 2013 and played in the local leagues until 2022. Since 2010, the Noose Lane ground has been owned by, and the home of, local league club Sporting Khalsa F.C.

Two war memorials were erected in the town after World War I to commemorate the hundreds of men from the town who lost their lives in the conflict. The memorial park was opened in 1922 in honour of those killed in that war.

The entertainment industry in Willenhall was boosted in 1914 by the opening of the town&#x27;s first cinema, the Coliseum. It was followed a year later by the Picture House. A third cinema, the Dale Cinema, opened in the town in 1932. However, the closure of The Dale at the end of 1967 signaled the end of cinemas in Willenhall after 53 years. The building was later converted into a bingo hall and since December 1999 has been a J D Wetherspoon public house.

The growing population of Willenhall around the turn of the 20th century led to increased overcrowding and a need for new properties to be built. In 1920, the town&#x27;s first council houses were built in Temple Road. Over the next 50 years or so, thousands of new private and council houses were built, mostly expanding on developments up to three miles north of the town centre. Willenhall Town Hall was completed in 1935 and public baths were erected in 1939.

The majority of Willenhall became part of Walsall Metropolitan Borough in 1966. However, a percentage, mainly Portobello, came under the jurisdiction of City of Wolverhampton Council, and still continues to be so.

By the late 1970s, the local industry was in decline, and by the year 2000 most of the town&#x27;s lock-makers had closed or relocated. The former Yale factory was demolished in 2009 and replaced by a Morrisons supermarket which opened in January 2010.
However, the town&#x27;s high street retains many of its old buildings which have been local landmarks since the turn of the 20th century or earlier.

==Future==
&quot;Much of the town centre is a designated conservation area and a £2.1 million bid for the Heritage Lottery funding is being prepared ... to fund enhancements to local buildings.&quot; So, within the next few years Willenhall Town Centre is set to undergo some regeneration. Currently the outskirts of the town centre are lined with abandoned factories, although most have been demolished and will be replaced with new flats. The part currently includes a Morrisons branch along with Lidl, Tesco and Spar within its borders.

There are plans to reopen Willenhall Bilston Street railway station to passengers in 2025.

==Parish churches==
The town of Willenhall is the home of four different parish churches of the Church of England: St. Giles&#x27;, St. Stephen&#x27;s, St. Anne&#x27;s, and Holy Trinity. St. Giles&#x27; did not originally have its own ecclesiastical district: before 1846 it was a Chapel of Ease to the mother church of St. Peter&#x27;s, Wolverhampton. The chapel was for those who could not afford to go to Wolverhampton to worship, baptize or marry.

St. Giles&#x27; Chapel was the most ancient in the town of Willenhall. It was considered a chapel of ease before 1846 and was probably built &quot;at the commencement of the 14th century.&quot; &quot;The medieval church was demolished in 1748&quot; because it began to decay from old age. The new church was completed in about two years and in 1750, the new church was again open for worship. In 1848, it became a parish church of the Church of England in Willenhall. St. Stephen&#x27;s and Holy Trinity were finished in 1854, and St. Anne&#x27;s was built about 10 years later.
The Parish Church of St. Stephen&#x27;s is named after St. Stephen the Martyr. The church register began in 1848, but it took six years to fund the building of the church. After funds were raised, it was built and then consecrated on 31 October 1854. In the second half of the 20th century, the church began to deteriorate because of dry rot, and it was demolished in 1978. Because of the deterioration of the church, work began on a new church in January 1977, and it was dedicated on 8 September 1979. Many of the statues from the original church were brought into the new one.

St Anne&#x27;s Church was also built as a chapel of ease in 1858, but it became a Parish church in 1861. &quot;In the 1970s the church interior was turned around by 90degrees, a raised dais being built on the south wall, with a new altar, the old Sanctuary becoming the Lady Chapel.&quot; However, after restoration in the 21st century, most of the lead was then stolen from its roof.

Holy Trinity Church, in Short Heath, was consecrated on 25 July 1855. The parish of Holy Trinity had been established in 1846, and services were held in rooms in the area until the church, a sandstone building designed by W. Horton, was built. It was financed mostly by Daniel Bagnall, owner of the Coltham Iron and Coal Company, Mr Barnabas and Sons, and Joseph Samuel Junior. It has a nave, aisles a chancel, and a turret with one bell.

==Industry==
Willenhall is famous for the manufacture of locks, and the Locksmith&#x27;s House (The Lock Museum), dating from Victorian times, demonstrates how one particular family of lock makers lived and worked at the very beginning of the 20th century. This small museum is managed by the Black Country Living Museum and is open for pre-arranged group visits, including educational programmes for schools. The Locksmith&#x27;s House is situated in New Road.

To make trading easier, the New Road (a toll road) was built before 1820, acting as an effective bypass for the main high street. Outside the town itself, settlements grew up around local industries. The area around Lane Head and Sandbeds had a thriving mining community and Portobello grew around the brickmaking industry. There was much coal mining in the Willenhall area until the 19th century when the industry came to a dramatic halt after a strike when the mines were flooded and lost forever. Lockmaking began in the area in Elizabethan times mainly in Wolverhampton, Willenhall and Bilston. Eventually it became concentrated in Willenhall, where lock making had begun as a cottage industry with many families producing locks and parts for locks in sheds or outhouses at the rear of their homes. Because long hours bending over their work tended to produce workers with humps on their backs, the town became known locally as &#x27;Humpshire&#x27; and is still regarded as such with affection by many locals.

As late as 1956 there were still local men who had humps. Some public houses even had holes in the wall behind the wooden bench seats to allow their patrons to sit comfortably with their hump in the hole. Nearly all examples of such pubs have been lost. The Bell Inn in Market Street is an example of such a pub with curved holes in the walls to allow hump backed drinkers to sit up straight. Rushbrook&#x27;s was a bakery in Market Street, Willenhall. In 1853, Rushbrook&#x27;s struck their own &quot;Rushbrook Farthing&quot;, a tradesman&#x27;s token widely in use in the area. In the early 1960s, the Spring Vale Tavern in St Anne&#x27;s Road was renamed The Rushbrook Farthing in remembrance of this unusual practice.

== Demography ==
At the 2021 census, Willenhall&#x27;s built-up area population was recorded as having a population of 49,587 making it the second largest town in the Walsall Borough, after Walsall. Of the findings, the ethnicity and religious composition of the wards separately were:

The tables show that Willenhall is an ethically diverse town and has one of the highest Sikh populations in the West Midlands. 

== Transport ==
===Public transport===
Willenhall is well served by buses. The town centre lies on the 529 Bus route, which links Walsall and Wolverhampton running every 7 to 10 minutes on average during weekdays and every 15 - 30 minutes at other times, including evening and Sundays. Other local bus routes link the town to Ashmore Park, Wednesfield, Wednesbury, Darlaston, Bilston and Bloxwich as well as the local areas of Coppice Farm, Pool Hayes, Short Heath, Lodge Farm, New Invention, Bentley, Portobello and Lane Head.

There is no central bus station, although all routes can be accessed at two main points - the &#x27;Market Place&#x27; stops and Lower Lichfield Street stop (near the Morrisons Store). These act somewhat as interchange points.

25, 37, 41, and 529 bus routes are operated by National Express West Midlands, whilst 57, 303, 310 and 326 are operated by Diamond West Midlands and services 23/23A are operated by Carolean Coaches.

Willenhall is poorly served by other modes of public transport. Both of the town&#x27;s two railway stations (Willenhall Bilston Street railway station and Willenhall Stafford Street railway station) have been closed for over 40 years, and although plans were brought to reopen Bilston Street, this never materialised due to the withdrawal of funding for the rail line it would serve. The station at Bilston Street was set to reopen by the end of 2021 after securing funding in March 2018, and will be the first time Willenhall has had a rail connection since 1965.

Willenhall is currently not served by the West Midlands Metro light rail network, but one of the numerous expansion plans for the system is the 5 W&#x27;s Route, which would link Willenhall with Wednesfield, Wolverhampton, Wednesbury and Walsall and via Darlaston, Bentley, Reedswood, Birchills, New Cross Hospital, Walsall Manor Hospital and Heath Town. Currently, there are some plans to create a line from Stourbridge to Wednesfield via Willenhall, however this is not planned to open or even start construction until at least the late 2020s, once the other 3 metro lines are open.

===Road infrastructure===
Willenhall is about 10 minutes drive away from Junction 10 of the M6. Many main roads run through the area including The Keyway (which runs from Willenhall to Wolverhampton/Willenhall border) and the A454, The Black Country Route.

Due to its central location, Willenhall is home to the main hubs of Poundland as well as transport companies Aspray and DX Freight. Additionally, dairy firm Müller Milk &amp; Ingredients has a depot in the Ashmore Lake area of the town.

==Landmarks==
The main landmarks include The Locksmith&#x27;s House museum in New Road; the cholera burial ground in Doctors Piece; St Giles Church; the bandstand in Willenhall Park; the Clock Tower, The Bell Inn, the malthouse (now Davey&#x27;s Locker shop), and the Lock and Key sculptures in the market place; Dale House (now a restaurant) and the Dale cinema (now a Wetherspoon&#x27;s pub); the Toll House (now a restaurant), and the old Town Hall (now the library) in Walsall Street.

<doc id="396501" wikidata="Q207024" url="?curid=396501" title="Mauritanian ouguiya">
<text>The ouguiya ( (); sign: UM; code: MRU), at one time spelled &quot;ougiya&quot;, is the currency of Mauritania. Each ouguiya constitutes five khoums (meaning &quot;one fifth&quot;).

The current ouguiya was introduced in 2018, replacing the old ouguiya at a rate of 1 new ouguiya = 10 old ouguiya, which in turn replaced the CFA franc at a rate of 1 old ouguiya = 5 francs.
The name &quot;ouguiya&quot; () is the Hassaniya Arabic pronunciation of &quot;uqiyyah&quot; ), meaning &quot;ounce&quot;.

==First Ouguiya (MRO)==
===Coins===
In 1973, coins of (1 khoums), 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 ouguiya were introduced into circulation. This was the only year that the khoums was minted, as the ouguiya was worth five CFA Francs a khoums was the equivalent of the franc (which had no subdivision). The most recent issues were in 2003 (1 ouguiya) and 2004 (other denominations). Coins are minted at the Kremnica mint in Slovakia. The coinage slightly changed in 2009, with a reduced 1 ouguiya in plated composition and a bi-metallic 20 ouguiya issued. A bi-metallic 50 ouguiya was issued December 2010.

===Banknotes===
In 1973, notes were issued by the Central Bank of Mauritania (&quot;Banque Centrale de Mauritanie&quot;) in denominations of 100, 200 and 1,000 ouguiya. In 1974, a second series of notes was issued in the same denominations, with 500-ouguiya notes added in 1979. Banknotes have been printed by Giesecke &amp; Devrient in Munich, starting with the second issue. 

New banknotes and new coins were introduced in 2004. These notes have completely new fronts and the vignettes on the backs have been redesigned to accommodate the reduction in size. The 2,000-ouguiya denomination is entirely new.

All but the 100 and 200 ouguiya notes have the denomination expressed in Arabic numerals in a holographic patch at right front. The serial numbers for all denominations now appear horizontally at upper left and lower center, and vertically at far right, all formatted with a 2-character prefix, 7-digit serial number, and 1-character suffix.

An entirely new 5,000-ouguiya denomination dated 28 November 2009 was introduced on 8 August 2010, followed by a redesigned 2,000-ouguiya note dated 28 November 2011 issued on 1 February 2012.

==Second ouguiya (MRU)==
On 5 December 2017, the Central Bank of Mauritania announced a redenomination of its currency at a rate of 1:10. As part of the redenomination, a new series of coins were issued in denominations of 1 khoums ( ouguiya), 1, 5, 10 and 20 ouguiya, with the latter being struck as a tri-metallic coin and a new series of banknotes in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 ouguiya. The new ouguiya banknotes issued for the redenomination are printed entirely in polymer. As a consequence of this change, the ISO Currency Codes for the ouguiya were amended to MRU / 929 and the existing codes of MRO / 478 were retired as per ISO 4217 Amendment Number 165 dated 14 December 2017. A 2 ouguiya coin was issued into circulation in 2018, serving as an intermediate denomination for the 1 and 5 ouguiya coins already in circulation. On 28 November 2021, the Central Bank of Mauritania issued a 20 ouguiya banknote, co-circulating with the coin of the same denomination in circulation. On 15 June 2023, the Central Bank of Mauritania issued a new 50 ouguiya banknote in celebration of 50 years of the circulation of the ouguiya in Mauritania, co-circulating with the previous banknote of the same denomination.

<doc id="396502" wikidata="Q373558" url="?curid=396502" title="Culpeo">
<text>The culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus), also known as Culpeo zorro, Andean zorro, Andean fox, Paramo wolf, Andean wolf, and colpeo fox, is a species of South American fox. Despite the name, it is not a true fox, but more closely related to wolves and jackals. Its appearance resembles that of foxes due to convergent evolution.

The culpeo&#x27;s diet consists largely of rodents, rabbits, birds and lizards, and to a lesser extent, plant material and carrion. They may prey on Andean flamingos and baby vicuña. The culpeo occasionally attacks sheep and is, therefore, often hunted or poisoned. In some regions, it has become rare, but overall the species is not threatened with extinction.

The culpeo was domesticated by the Selk&#x27;nam people of Tierra del Fuego, producing the Fuegian dog which became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.

==Description==
The culpeo is a canid intermediate in size between a red fox and a coyote. It is the second-largest native canid on the continent after the maned wolf. In appearance, it bears many similarities to the widely recognized red fox. It has grey and reddish fur, a white chin, reddish legs and a stripe on its back that may be barely visible. The average weight of the male is , while the typically smaller females average . Overall, a weight range of has been reported. Total length can range from , including a tail of in length. The pelt has a grizzled appearance. The neck and shoulders are often tawny to rufous in color, while the upper back is dark. The bushy tail has a black tip.

==Range==

The culpeo&#x27;s range extends from the southern regions of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego in the south to Ecuador and Peru in the north, with some populations extending into southern Colombia. It is also found in the Sierras Grandes mountain range in Córdoba, Argentina. It is most common on the western slopes of the Andes, where it inhabits open country and deciduous forests.

==Habitat==
The culpeo lives in a wide variety of habitats of western South America. They are found in broadleaf &quot;Nothofagus&quot; temperate rainforest, sclerophyllous matorral, deserts, chaparrals, and plateaus, like the Altiplano, up to the tree line ().

==Diet==

The culpeo is an opportunistic predator that will take any variety of prey. It mainly feeds on rodents (including common degus) and lagomorphs (especially the introduced European rabbit and European hare); however, it occasionally feeds on domestic livestock and young guanacos. They will also feed on insects, birds, lizards, fruit, and carrion of llamas and vicuñas. Culpeos are considered beneficial because they are significant predators of the rabbits introduced in 1915; such introduced rabbit populations are believed to have allowed culpeos to spread from the Andean foothills across the Patagonian plain. They sometimes take young lambs up to 1 week old. In limited studies, the larger culpeo appears to dominate potential competitors, including South American gray foxes, Geoffroy&#x27;s cats, pampas cats, grisons and various raptorial birds. In the southeastern Argentine Patagonia region, culpeos generally tend to consume more of the introduced European hare than the South American gray fox does year-round, while the gray fox tends to consume more rodents. However, during colder seasons, the culpeo&#x27;s diet overlaps more with the gray fox due to a lack of variety in prey, thus causing prey partitioning as the culpeos use their size advantage to exclude the gray fox from areas with higher concentrations of prey. Its range also overlaps that of the much larger puma, but the size difference ensures that the two species have limited competition. They are known to eat the carcasses of vicuñas. Culpeos have also been observed preying upon introduced beavers in Tierra del Fuego.
During a period of drought in central Chile&#x27;s scrublands lagomorphs, coati, goats, and cattle make up a large amount of their diet.

==Reproduction==
The typical mating period is between August and October. After a gestation period of 55–60 days, the female gives birth usually to between two and five pups.

==Classification==

===Subspecies===
===Taxonomy===
The taxonomy of the culpeo has been the topic of debate due to their high phenetic variability and the scarcity of research, among other things. Over the past three decades, they have been placed variably in the genera &quot;Dusicyon&quot; (Clutton-Brock, &quot;et al.&quot;, 1976; Wozencraft, 1989), &quot;Canis&quot; (Langguth, 1975; Van Gelder, 1978), &quot;Pseudalopex&quot; (Berta, 1987; Wozencraft, 1993; Tedford &quot;et al.&quot;, 1995) and &quot;Lycalopex&quot; (Zunino, 1995; Wozencraft, 2005).

This canid, like other South American foxes, is still sometimes classified as a member of the genus &quot;Pseudalopex&quot;. As &quot;Pseudalopex&quot; and &quot;Lycalopex&quot; have largely come to describe the same genus, either classification is acceptable, although the modern practice is to give &quot;Lycalopex&quot; prominence.

<doc id="396505" wikidata="Q693148" url="?curid=396505" title="International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants">
<text>The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN or ICNafp) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those &quot;traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants&quot;. It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the &quot;Melbourne Code&quot; which replaced the &quot;Vienna Code&quot; of 2005.

The current version of the code is the &quot;Shenzhen Code&quot; adopted by the International Botanical Congress held in Shenzhen, China, in July 2017. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on 29 July 2017), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not published until 26 June 2018. For fungi the &quot;Code&quot; was revised by the &quot;San Juan Chapter F&quot; in 2018. The 2025 edition of ICBN, the &quot;Madrid Code&quot;, which reflects the decisions of the Twentieth International Botanical Congress met in Madrid, Spain, in July 2024, is prepared to be published in July 2025.

The name of the &quot;Code&quot; is partly capitalized and partly not. The lower-case for &quot;algae, fungi, and plants&quot; indicates that these terms are not formal names of clades, but indicate groups of organisms that were historically known by these names and traditionally studied by phycologists, mycologists, and botanists. This includes blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria); fungi, including chytrids, oomycetes, and slime moulds; photosynthetic protists and taxonomically related non-photosynthetic groups. There are special provisions in the &quot;ICN&quot; for some of these groups, as there are for fossils.

The &quot;ICN&quot; can only be changed by an International Botanical Congress (IBC), with the International Association for Plant Taxonomy providing the supporting infrastructure. Each new edition supersedes the earlier editions and is retroactive back to 1753, except where different starting dates are specified.

For the naming of cultivated plants there is a separate code, the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants&quot;, which gives rules and recommendations that supplement the &quot;ICN&quot;.

== Principles ==
* Botanical nomenclature is independent of zoological, bacteriological, and viral nomenclature (see Nomenclature codes).
* A botanical name is fixed to a taxon by a type. This is almost invariably dried plant material and is usually deposited and preserved in a herbarium, although it may also be an image or a preserved culture. Some type collections can be viewed online at the websites of the herbaria in question.
* A guiding principle in botanical nomenclature is priority, the first publication of a name for a taxon. The formal starting date for purposes of priority is 1 May 1753, the publication of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; by Linnaeus. However, to avoid undesirable (destabilizing) effects of strict enforcement of priority, conservation of family, genus, and species names is possible.
* The intent of the Code is that each taxonomic group (&quot;taxon&quot;, plural &quot;taxa&quot;) of plants has only one correct name that is accepted worldwide, provided that it has the same circumscription, position and rank. The value of a scientific name is that it is an identifier; it is not necessarily of descriptive value.
* Names of taxa are treated as Latin.
* The rules of nomenclature are retroactive unless there is an explicit statement that this does not apply.

== History ==

The rules governing botanical nomenclature have a long and tumultuous history, dating back to dissatisfaction with rules that were established in 1843 to govern zoological nomenclature. The first set of international rules was the (&quot;Laws of botanical nomenclature&quot;) that was adopted as the &quot;best guide to follow for botanical nomenclature&quot; at an &quot;International Botanical Congress&quot; convened in Paris in 1867. Unlike modern Codes, it contained recommendations for naming to serve as the basis for discussions on the controversial points of nomenclature, rather than obligatory rules for validly published and legitimate names within the Code. It was organized as six sections with 68 articles in total.

Multiple attempts to bring more &quot;expedient&quot; or more equitable practice to botanical nomenclature resulted in several competing codes, which finally reached a compromise with the 1930 congress. In the meantime, the second edition of the international rules followed the Vienna congress in 1905. These rules were published as the (or in English, &quot;International rules of Botanical Nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Conference of Vienna 1905&quot;). Informally they are referred to as the &quot;Vienna Rules&quot; (not to be confused with the &quot;Vienna Code&quot; of 2006).

Some but not all subsequent meetings of the International Botanical Congress have produced revised versions of these &quot;Rules&quot;, later called the &quot;International Code of Botanical Nomenclature&quot;, and then &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot;.

The Nomenclature Section of the 18th International Botanical Congress in Melbourne, Australia (2011) made major changes:
* The &quot;Code&quot; now permits electronic-only publication of names of new taxa; no longer will it be a requirement to deposit some paper copies in libraries.
* The requirement for a Latin validating diagnosis or description was changed to allow either English or Latin for these essential components of the publication of a new name (Article 39).
* &quot;One fungus, one name&quot; and &quot;one fossil, one name&quot; are important changes; the concepts of &quot;anamorph&quot; and &quot;teleomorph&quot; (for fungi) and &quot;morphotaxa&quot; (for fossils) have been eliminated.
* As an experiment with &quot;registration of names&quot;, new fungal descriptions require the use of an identifier from &quot;a recognized repository&quot;; there are two recognized repositories so far, Index Fungorum and MycoBank.

<text>Dusicyon is an extinct genus of South American canids.

== Taxonomy ==
The type species is &quot;Dusicyon australis&quot;, the Falkland Islands wolf. In 1914, Oldfield Thomas established this genus, in which he included the culpeo and other South American foxes. These other canids were removed to &quot;Lycalopex&quot; by Langguth in 1975. There is still much debate about the classification of &quot;Dusicyon cultridens&quot;. It has been suggested that this species be placed in the genera &quot;Canis&quot; or &quot;Lycalopex&quot;. This debate makes &quot;D. cultridens&quot; poorly researched.

== Extinctions ==
&quot;Dusicyon avus&quot;, widely distributed in the late Pleistocene from Uruguay through Buenos Aires Province to southernmost Chile, is the closest known relative of the Falkland Islands wolf; the two lineages split only about 16,000 years ago. It died out in the late Holocene, earlier estimates suggested about 2,980 years ago on the island of Tierra del Fuego and almost 1,700 years ago in the continent. More recent research confirms much later extinction dates, with the latest confirmed records in the Pampean Region being 700 BP (1232–1397 AD) and southernmost Patagonia at 400 years BP (1454–1626 AD).

<doc id="396507" wikidata="Q172118" url="?curid=396507" title="Percy Williams Bridgman">
<text>Percy Williams Bridgman (April 21, 1882 – August 20, 1961) was an American physicist who received the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the physics of high pressures. He also wrote extensively on the scientific method and on other aspects of the philosophy of science. The Bridgman effect, the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique, and the high-pressure mineral bridgmanite are named after him.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bridgman was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and grew up in nearby Auburndale.

Bridgman&#x27;s parents were both born in New England. His father, Raymond Landon Bridgman, was &quot;profoundly religious and idealistic&quot; and worked as a newspaper reporter assigned to state politics. His mother, Mary Ann Maria Williams, was described as &quot;more conventional, sprightly, and competitive&quot;.

Bridgman attended both elementary and high school in Auburndale, where he excelled at competitions in the classroom, on the playground, and while playing chess. Described as both shy and proud, his home life consisted of family music, card games, and domestic and garden chores. The family was deeply religious; reading the Bible each morning and attending a Congregational Church. However, Bridgman later became an atheist.

===Education and professional life===
Bridgman entered Harvard University in 1900, and studied physics through to his PhD. From 1910 until his retirement, he taught at Harvard, becoming a full professor in 1919. In 1905, he began investigating the properties of matter under high pressure. A machinery malfunction led him to modify his pressure apparatus; the result was a new sealing device enabling him to create pressures eventually exceeding 100,000 kgf/cm2 (10 GPa; 100,000 atmospheres). This was a huge improvement over previous machinery, which could achieve pressures of only 3,000 kgf/cm2 (0.3 GPa). This new apparatus led to an abundance of new findings, including a study of the compressibility, electric and thermal conductivity, tensile strength and viscosity of more than 100 different compounds. Bridgman is also known for his studies of electrical conduction in metals and properties of crystals. He developed the Bridgman seal and is the eponym for Bridgman&#x27;s thermodynamic equations, which were used to further his research.

Bridgman made many improvements to his high-pressure apparatus over the years, and unsuccessfully attempted the synthesis of diamond many times. The high-pressure torsion apparatus developed by Bridgman significantly contributed to the development of severe plastic deformation field decades later.

His philosophy of science book &quot;The Logic of Modern Physics&quot; (1927) advocated operationalism and coined the term operational definition. In 1938 he participated in the International Committee composed to organise the International Congresses for the Unity of Science. He was also one of the 11 signatories to the Russell–Einstein Manifesto.

J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project, was an undergraduate student of Bridgman&#x27;s. Of his teaching abilities, Oppenheimer said that, “I found Bridgman a wonderful teacher because he never really was quite reconciled to things being the way they were and he always thought them out.”

===Home life and death===

Bridgman married Olive Ware (1882-1972), of Hartford, Connecticut, in 1912. Ware&#x27;s father, Edmund Asa Ware, was the founder and first president of Atlanta University. The couple had two children and were married for nearly 50 years, living most of that time in Cambridge. The family also had a summer home in Randolph, New Hampshire, where Bridgman was known as a skilled mountain climber.

Bridgman was a &quot;penetrating analytical thinker&quot; with a &quot;fertile mechanical imagination&quot; and exceptional manual dexterity. He was a skilled plumber and carpenter, known to shun the assistance of professionals in these matters. He was also fond of music and played the piano, and took pride in his flower and vegetable gardens.

Bridgman committed suicide by gunshot after suffering from metastatic cancer for some time. His suicide note was a mere two sentences; &quot;It isn&#x27;t decent for society to make a man do this thing himself. Probably this is the last day I will be able to do it myself.&quot; Bridgman&#x27;s words have been quoted by many in the assisted suicide debate.

==Honors and awards==
Bridgman received Doctors, &quot;honoris causa&quot; from Stevens Institute (1934), Harvard (1939), Brooklyn Polytechnic (1941), Princeton (1950), Paris (1950), and Yale (1951). He received the Bingham Medal (1951) from the Society of Rheology, the Rumford Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1919), the Elliott Cresson Medal (1932) from the Franklin Institute, the Gold Medal from Bakhuys Roozeboom Fund (founder Hendrik Willem Bakhuis Roozeboom) (1933) from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Comstock Prize (1933) of the National Academy of Sciences.

Bridgman was a member of the American Physical Society and was its president in 1942. He was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the National Academy of Sciences. He was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society and Honorary Fellow of the Physical Society of London.

The Percy W. Bridgman House, in Massachusetts, is a U.S. National Historic Landmark designated in 1975.

In 2014, the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the International Mineralogical Association approved the name bridgmanite for perovskite-structured ,the Earth&#x27;s most abundant mineral, in honor of his high-pressure research.

<doc id="396508" wikidata="Q1601541" url="?curid=396508" title="HVAC control system">
<text>[[HVAC]] (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) equipment needs a control system to regulate the operation of a heating and/or air conditioning system. Usually a sensing device is used to compare the actual state (e.g. temperature) with a target state. Then the control system draws a conclusion what action has to be taken (e.g. start the blower).

==Direct digital control==
Central controllers and most terminal unit controllers are programmable, meaning the direct digital control program code may be customized for the intended use. The program features include time schedules, set points, controllers, logic, timers, trend logs, and alarms. The unit controllers typically have analog and digital inputs that allow measurement of the variable (temperature, humidity, or pressure) and analog and digital outputs for control of the transport medium (hot/cold water and/or steam). Digital inputs are typically (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device. Digital outputs are typically relay contacts used to start and stop equipment, and analog outputs are typically voltage or current signals to control the movement of the medium (air/water/steam) control devices such as valves, dampers, and motors.

Groups of DDC controllers, networked or not, form a layer of systems themselves. This &quot;subsystem&quot; is vital to the performance and basic operation of the overall HVAC system. The DDC system is the &quot;brain&quot; of the HVAC system. It dictates the position of every damper and valve in a system. It determines which fans, pumps, and chiller run and at what speed or capacity. With this configurable intelligence in this &quot;brain&quot;, we are moving to the concept of building automation.

==Building automation system==
More complex HVAC systems can interface to Building Automation System (BAS) to allow the building owners to have more control over the heating or cooling units. The building owner can monitor the system and respond to alarms generated by the system from local or remote locations. The system can be scheduled for occupancy or the configuration can be changed from the BAS. Sometimes the BAS is directly controlling the HVAC components.
Depending on the BAS different interfaces can be used.

Today, there are also dedicated gateways that connect advanced VRV / VRF and Split HVAC Systems with Home Automation and BMS (Building Management Systems) controllers for centralized control and monitoring, obviating the need to purchase more complex and expensive HVAC systems. In addition, such gateway solutions are capable of providing remote control operation of all HVAC indoor units over the internet incorporating a simple and friendly user interface.

== Cost and efficiency ==
Many people do not have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Condition (HVAC) system in their homes because it is too expensive. However according to this article &quot;Save Money Through Energy Efficiency&quot;, HVAC is not as expensive as one may think it is. Although many might choose to not believe that sticker and that it is just there to help with the sales, history shows that many of the newer HVAC systems with the yellow energy guide stickers help save customers hundreds to thousands of dollars depending on how much they use their HVAC system. 

On the yellow energy guide sticker on many of the newer systems, it displays the average cost to run that machine. Once a customer has found the perfect HVAC system, the customer should run it monthly if it is only put into use during specific times of year. It is recommended that if an HVAC system is not being used each month, that it should be turned on and left running for ten to fifteen minutes. 

On the other hand if the customer is somebody who runs their HVAC system frequently, it is really important to maintain it. Maintenance on an HVAC system includes changing out the air filter, inspecting the areas where air intake takes place, and check for leaks. 

Doing these three steps are super essential and is the key to keeping an HVAC system running for a long time. A customer should do these three steps every couple of months or when it is suspected problem with the HVAC system. 

Some signs that could lead to a potential problem is if the HVAC system does not provide air cool enough. 

That could be due to a leakage in the cooling fluids. Another sign that could mean that the HVAC system is not running perfectly fine is if there is a bad smell to the air that it is providing. That often means that the air filters need to be replaced. Changing the air filters on an HVAC system is really important because they are exposed to a lot of dust depending on where your HVAC system is and it could build up dust from simply just sitting in one&#x27;s home.

== Goals HVAC system installation ==
Goal 1: Keep HVAC equipment and materials dry during construction and provide temperature and humidity control as required during the close-in phase of construction. HVAC System Installation 

Goal 2: Install HVAC systems to effectively implement moisture control as specified in the design drawings and specifications. HVAC System Installation 

Goal 3: Prepare operation and maintenance materials for continued performance of HVAC system moisture control.

== Design, modeling, and marketing ==
Most HVAC systems are used for the same purpose but designed differently. 

All HVAC systems have an intake, air filter, and air conditioning liquid. However, when designing HVAC systems, many engineers design it for a specific setting and/or purpose. When engineers are designing an HVAC system, they try their best to make it compact while still being able to perform at the highest level and experiment with different ways to make HVAC systems as efficient as possible. 

==History==
The first HVAC controllers utilized pneumatic controls since engineers understood fluid control. Thus, the properties of steam and air were used to control the flow of heated or cooled air via mechanically controlled logic.

After the control of air flow and temperature was standardized, the use of electromechanical relays in ladder logic to switch dampers became standardized. Eventually, the relays became electronic switches, as transistors eventually could handle greater current loads. By 1985, pneumatic controls could no longer compete with this new technology although pneumatic control systems (sometimes decades old) are still common in many older buildings.

By the year 2000, computerized controllers were common. Today, some of these controllers can even be accessed by web browsers, which need no longer be in the same building as the HVAC equipment. This allows some economies of scale, as a single operations center can easily monitor multiple buildings.

<doc id="396513" wikidata="Q1747683" url="?curid=396513" title="Simulation (computer science)">
<text>In theoretical computer science a simulation is a relation between state transition systems associating systems that behave in the same way in the sense that one system &quot;simulates&quot; the other.

Intuitively, a system simulates another system if it can match all of its moves.

The basic definition relates states within one transition system, but this is easily adapted to relate two separate transition systems by building a system consisting of the disjoint union of the corresponding components.

==Formal definition==
Given a labelled state transition system (formula_1, formula_2, →),
where formula_1 is a set of states, formula_2 is a set of labels and → is a set of labelled transitions (i.e., a subset of formula_5),
a relation formula_6 is a simulation if and only if for every pair of states formula_7 in formula_8 and all labels λ in formula_2:

: if formula_10, then there is formula_11 such that formula_12

Equivalently, in terms of relational composition:
:formula_13

Given two states formula_14 and formula_15 in formula_1, formula_14 can be simulated by formula_15, written formula_19, if and only if there is a simulation formula_8 such that formula_21. The relation formula_22 is called the simulation preorder, and it is the union of all simulations: formula_23 precisely when formula_21 for some simulation formula_8.

The set of simulations is closed under union; therefore, the simulation preorder is itself a simulation. Since it is the union of all simulations, it is the unique largest simulation. Simulations are also closed under reflexive and transitive closure; therefore, the largest simulation must be reflexive and transitive. From this follows that the largest simulation—the simulation preorder—is indeed a preorder relation. Note that there can be more than one relation that is both a simulation and a preorder; the term &quot;simulation preorder&quot; refers to the largest one of them (which is a superset of all the others).

Two states formula_14 and formula_15 are said to be similar, written formula_28, if and only if formula_14 can be simulated by formula_15 and formula_15 can be simulated by formula_14. Similarity is thus the maximal symmetric subset of the simulation preorder, which means it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive; hence an equivalence relation. However, it is not necessarily a simulation, and precisely in those cases when it is not a simulation, it is strictly coarser than bisimilarity (meaning it is a superset of bisimilarity).
To witness, consider a similarity that &quot;is&quot; a simulation. Since it is symmetric, it is a &quot;bisimulation&quot;. It must then be a &quot;subset&quot; of bisimilarity, which is the union of all bisimulations. Yet it is easy to see that similarity is always a &quot;superset&quot; of bisimilarity. From this follows that if similarity is a simulation, it equals bisimilarity. And if it equals bisimilarity, it is naturally a simulation (since bisimilarity is a simulation). Therefore, similarity is a simulation if and only if it equals bisimilarity. If it does not, it must be its strict superset; hence a strictly coarser equivalence relation.

==Similarity of separate transition systems==
When comparing two different transition systems (S&#x27;, Λ&#x27;, →&#x27;) and (S&quot;, Λ&quot;, →&quot;), the basic notions of simulation and similarity can be used by forming the disjoint composition of the two machines, (S, Λ, →) with S = S&#x27; ∐ S&quot;, Λ = Λ&#x27; ∪ Λ&quot; and → = →&#x27; ∪ →&quot;, where ∐ is the disjoint union operator between sets.

<text>Sir Edward Victor Appleton (6 September 1892 – 21 April 1965) was an English physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1947 &quot;for his investigations of the physics of the upper atmosphere especially for the discovery of the so-called Appleton layer&quot;. 

== Biography ==

Appleton was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Peter Appleton, a warehouseman, and Mary Wilcock, and was educated at Hanson Grammar School.

In 1911, aged 18, he was awarded a scholarship to attend St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated with First Class Honours in Natural Science with Physics in 1913. He was also a member of Isaac Newton University Lodge. In 1915 he married his first wife, Jessie Appleton (formerly Longson), with whom he had two children. Three years after her death he married Helen Lennie (m. 1965).

During the First World War he joined the West Riding Regiment, and later transferred to the Royal Engineers. After returning from active service in the First World War, Appleton became assistant demonstrator in experimental physics at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1920. In 1922 he was initiated into Freemasonry. He was professor of physics at King&#x27;s College London (1924–1936) and professor of natural philosophy at the University of Cambridge (1936–1939). From 1939 to 1949 he was secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Knighted in 1941, he received the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the knowledge of the ionosphere, which led to the development of radar.

From 1949 until his death in 1965, Appleton was Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh. From 1960 he was involved with the University&#x27;s plans for a CDA (Comprehensive Development Area) which would have demolished 125 acres of Edinburgh&#x27;s historic southside, resulting in the loss of many homes and businesses. This University-led project blighted the area for a decade before being abandoned in the mid 1970s. One recent study describes Appleton as a megalomaniac in his desire to carry out these plans.

In 1956, the BBC invited him to deliver the annual Reith Lectures. Across a series of six radio broadcasts, titled &quot;Science and the Nation&quot;, he explored the many facets of scientific activity in Britain at the time.

Sir Edward died on 21 April 1965 at Edinburgh and is buried in Edinburgh&#x27;s Morningside Cemetery with his wife Helen Lennie (d. 1983). The grave lies towards the extreme western side near the new housing to the north-west.

== Works ==
Appleton had observed that the strength of the radio signal from a transmitter on a frequency such as the medium wave band and over a path of a hundred miles or so was constant during the day but that it varied during the night. This led him to believe that it was possible that two radio signals were being received. One was travelling along the ground, and another was reflected by a layer in the upper atmosphere. The fading or variation in strength of the overall radio signal received resulted from the interference pattern of the two signals.

The existence of a reflecting atmospheric layer was not in itself a completely new idea. Balfour Stewart had suggested the idea in the late 19th century to explain rhythmic changes in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. More recently, in 1902, Oliver Heaviside and Arthur E. Kennelly had suggested such an electromagnetic-reflecting stratum, now called the Kennelly–Heaviside layer, may explain the success Marconi had in transmitting his signals across the Atlantic. Calculations had shown that natural bending of the radio waves was not sufficient to stop them from simply &quot;shooting off&quot; into empty space before they reached the receiver.

Appleton thought the best place to look for evidence of the ionosphere was in the variations he believed it was causing around sunset in radio signal receptions. It was sensible to suggest these variations were due to the interference of two waves but an extra step to show that the second wave causing the interference (the first being the ground wave) was coming down from the ionosphere. The experiment he designed had two methods to show ionospheric influence and both allowed the height of the lower boundary of reflection (thus the lower boundary of the reflecting layer) to be determined. The first method was called frequency modulation and the second was to calculate the angle of arrival of the reflected signal at the receiving aerial.

The frequency modulation method exploits the fact that there is a path difference between the ground wave and the reflected wave, meaning they travel different distances from sender to receiver.

Let the distance AC travelled by the ground wave be h and the distance ABC travelled by the reflected wave h&#x27;. The path difference is:

formula_1

The wavelength of the transmitted signal is λ. The number of wavelengths difference between the paths h and h&#x27; is:

formula_2

If N is an integer number, then constructive interference will occur, this means a maximum signal will be achieved at the receiving end. If N is an odd integer number of half wavelengths, then destructive interference will occur and a minimum signal will be received. Let us assume we are receiving a maximum signal for a given wavelength λ. If we start to change λ, this is the process called frequency modulation, N will no longer be a whole number and destructive interference will start to occur, meaning the signal will start to fade. Now we keep changing λ until a maximum signal is once again received. The means that for our new value λ&#x27;, our new value N&#x27; is also an integer number. If we have lengthened λ then we know that N&#x27; is one less than N. Thus:

formula_3

Rearranging for D gives:

formula_4

As we know λ and λ&#x27;, we can calculate D. Using the approximation that ABC is an isosceles triangle, we can use our value of D to calculate the height of the reflecting layer. This method is a slightly simplified version of the method used by Appleton and his colleagues to work out a first value for the height of the ionosphere in 1924. In their experiment, they used the BBC broadcasting station in Bournemouth to vary the wavelengths of its emissions after the evening programmes had finished. They installed a receiving station in Oxford to monitor the interference effects. The receiving station had to be in Oxford as there was no suitable emitter at the right distance of about 62 miles (100 km) from Cambridge in those days.

This frequency modulation method revealed that the point from which waves were being reflected was approximately 56 miles (90 km). However, it did not establish that the waves were reflected from above, indeed they may have been coming from hills somewhere between Oxford and Bournemouth. The second method, which involved finding the angle of incidence of the reflected waves at the receiver, showed for sure that they were coming from above. Triangulations from this angle gave results for the height of reflection compatible with the frequency modulation method. We will not go into this method in detail because it involves fairly complex calculations using Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory.

Far from being conclusive, the success of the Oxford-Bournemouth experiment revealed a vast new field of study to be explored. It showed that there was indeed a reflecting layer high above the Earth but it also posed many new questions. What was the constitution of this layer, how did it reflect the waves, was it the same all over the earth, why did its effects change so dramatically between day and night, did it change throughout the year? Appleton would spend the rest of his life answering these questions. He developed a magneto-ionic theory based on the previous work of Lorentz and Maxwell to model the workings of this part of the atmosphere. Using this theory and further experiments, he showed that the so-called Kennelly–Heaviside layer was heavily ionised and thus conducting. This led to the term ionosphere. He showed free electrons to be the ionising agents. He discovered that the layer could be penetrated by waves above a certain frequency and that this critical frequency could be used to calculate the electron density in the layer. However these penetrating waves would also be reflected back, but from a much higher layer. This showed the ionosphere had a much more complex structure than first anticipated. The lower level was labelled E – Layer, reflected longer wavelengths and was found to be at approximately 78 miles (125 km). The high level, which had much higher electron density, was labelled F – Layer and could reflect much shorter wavelengths that penetrated the lower layer. It is situated 186 – 248 miles (300 – 400 km) above the earth&#x27;s surface. It is this which is often referred to as the Appleton Layer as is responsible for enabling most long range short wave telecommunication.

The magneto-ionic theory also allowed Appleton to explain the origin of the mysterious fadings heard on the radio around sunset. During the day, the light from the Sun causes the molecules in the air to become ionised even at fairly low altitudes. At these low altitudes, the density of the air is great and thus the electron density of ionised air is very large. Due to this heavy ionisation, there is strong absorption of electromagnetic waves caused by &#x27;electron friction&#x27;. Thus in transmissions over any distance, there will be no reflections as any waves apart from the one at ground level will be absorbed rather than reflected. However, when the sun sets, the molecules slowly start to recombine with their electrons and the free electron density levels drop. This means absorption rates diminish and waves can be reflected with sufficient strengths to be noticed, leading to the interference phenomena we have mentioned. For these interference patterns to occur though, there must not simply be the presence of a reflected wave but a change in the reflected wave. Otherwise the interference is constant and fadings would not be heard. The received signal would simply be louder or softer than during the day. This suggests the height at which reflection happens must slowly change as the sun sets. Appleton found in fact that it increased as the sun set and then decreased as the sun rose until the reflected wave was too weak to record. This variation is compatible with the theory that ionisation is due to the Sun&#x27;s influence. At sunset, the intensity of the Sun&#x27;s radiation will be much less at the surface of the Earth than it is high up in the atmosphere. This means ionic recombination will progress slowly from lower altitudes to higher ones and therefore the height at which waves are reflected slowly increases as the sun sets.

The basic idea behind Appleton&#x27;s work is so simple that it is hard to understand at first how he devoted almost all of his scientific career to its study. However, in the last couple of paragraphs some of the complexities of the subject have been introduced. Like many other fields, it is one that grows in intricacy the more it is studied. By the end of his life, ionospheric observatories had been set up all over the world to provide a global map of the reflecting layers. Links were found to the 11-year sunspot cycle and the aurora borealis, the magnetic storms that occur in high latitudes. This became particularly relevant during the Second World War when the storms would lead to radio blackouts. Thanks to Appleton&#x27;s research, the periods when these would occur could be predicted and communication could be switched to wavelengths that would be least affected. Radar, another crucial wartime innovation, was one that came about thanks to Appleton&#x27;s work. On a very general level, his research consisted in determining the distance of reflecting objects from radio signal transmitters. This is exactly the idea of radar and the flashing dots that appear on the screen (a cathode ray tube) scanned by the circulating &#x27;searcher&#x27; bar. This system was developed partly by Appleton as a new method, called the pulse method, to make ionospheric measurements. It was later adapted by Robert Watson-Watt to detect aeroplanes. Nowadays, ionospheric data is important when communications with satellites are considered. The correct frequencies for these signals must be selected so that they actually reach the satellites without being reflected or deviated before.

In 1974 the Radio and Space Research Station was renamed the Appleton Laboratory in honour of the man who had done so much to establish the UK as a leading force in ionospheric research, and had been involved with the station first as a researcher and then as secretary of its parent body, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.

<text>César Vichard de Saint-Réal (1639–1692) was a Savoyard polyglot.

He was born in Chambéry, Savoy, (then in the Savoyard state) but educated in Lyon by the Jesuits. He used to work in the royal library with Antoine Varillas, a French historiographer who influenced the way Saint-Réal that wrote history. He used to be a reader and friend of Hortense Mancini, duchesse de Mazarin, who took him with her to England (1675).

Saint-Réal was a polygraph writer. His works belong to different genres, but he always had an interest in history.

After some minor works written in order to win the protection of Louis XIV, he wrote &quot;De l&#x27;usage de l&#x27;histoire&quot; in 1671. In this essay, he speaks about the good way of writing history and explains that understanding of facts is more important than facts themselves. In 1672, he published &quot;Dom Carlos&quot;, subtitled &quot;nouvelle historique&quot;. The short novel or a long short story relates the love story of a forbidden passion between Dom Carlos, the son of Philip II of Spain, and his father&#x27;s wife Elisabeth of Valois. Saint-Réal mixes politics and love, but love appears much more important. The novel was a hit with high society. French critics now see it as an important text in the construction of the French psychological novel. It announces the style of Madame de La Fayette novels. &quot;Dom Carlos&quot; was the basis for Friedrich Schiller’s play &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (which in turn became the source material for several operatic works, including Giuseppe Verdi’s opera of the same name). Saint-Réal’s book was also the basis of the English writer Thomas Otway’s play &quot;Don Carlos, Prince of Spain&quot;.

However, Saint-Réal wanted to be a serious writer. He needed to write texts that were not fiction and so he published in 1674 la &quot;Conjuration des Espagnols contre la République de Venise en l&#x27;année M. DC. XVIII&quot;. It relates a Spanish conjuration against Venice. The historical work is not serious by modern criteria, but it was regarded by people of the end of the 17th and of the 18th centuries as a good example of classical prosis. In &quot;Le Siècle de Louis XIV&quot;, Voltaire calls Saint-Réal the &quot;French Sallust&quot; because of this work.

The authorship of the duchess&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires&quot; has been ascribed to Saint-Real, but no proof exists. He also wrote a &quot;Vie de Jésus Christ&quot; in 1678, a summary of the gospels. He took part in the literary arguments of his time with the short treatise &quot;De la critique&quot; (1691), directed against Andry de Boisregard&#x27;s &quot;Réflexions sur la langue française&quot;. There were many editions of his&quot;Œuvres complètes&quot; from the 17th to the 19th centuries, some of which were longer than others by including some works falsely attributed to him.

<text>Cecil Frank Powell (5 December 1903 – 9 August 1969) was an English physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1950 for heading the team that developed the photographic method of studying nuclear processes and for the resulting discovery of the pion (pi-meson), a subatomic particle.

== Personal life ==
Powell was born in Tonbridge, Kent, England, the son Frank and Elizabeth Caroline (née Bisacre) Powell. His father was a gunsmith. He was educated at a local primary school before gaining a scholarship to the Judd School, Tonbridge. Following this he attended Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, graduating in 1925 in natural sciences. After completing his bachelor&#x27;s degree he worked at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, under C.T.R. Wilson and Lord Rutherford, conducting research into condensation phenomena, and gaining his PhD in physics in 1929.

In 1932 Powell married Isobel Artner (1907–1995), and the couple had two daughters, Jane and Annie. 

== Professional life ==
In 1928 he took up a post as research assistant to Arthur Mannering Tyndall in the H.H. Wills Physical Laboratory at the University of Bristol, later being appointed lecturer, and in 1948 appointed Melville Wills Professor of Physics. In 1936 he took part in a Royal Society expedition to Montserrat in the West Indies as part of a study of a damaging earthquake swarm. He appears on a stamp issued in Grenada.

During his time at Bristol University, Powell applied himself to the development of techniques for measuring the mobility of positive ions, to establishing the nature of the ions in common gases, and to the construction and use of a Cockcroft generator to study the scattering of atomic nuclei. He also began to develop methods employing specialised photographic emulsions to facilitate the recording of the tracks of elementary particles, and in 1938 began applying this technique to the study of cosmic radiation, exposing photographic plates at high-altitude, at the tops of mountains and using specially designed balloons, collaborating in the study with Giuseppe &quot;Beppo&quot; Occhialini, Hugh Muirhead and young Brazilian physicist César Lattes. This work led in 1947 to the discovery of the pion (pi-meson), which proved to be the hypothetical particle proposed in 1935 by Hideki Yukawa in his theory of nuclear physics.

In 1949 Powell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and received the society&#x27;s Hughes Medal the same year. In 1950 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics &quot;for his development of the photographic method of studying nuclear processes and his discoveries regarding mesons made with this method&quot;. César Lattes was working with him at the time of the discovery and had improved the sensitivity of the photographic emulsion. César Lattes was the first to write an article describing the discovery that would lead to the Nobel Prize. Debendra Mohan Bose (nephew of Jagadish Chandra Bose) and Chowdhuri published three consecutive papers in &quot;Nature&quot;, but could not continue further investigation on account of &quot;non-availability of more sensitive emulsion plates during the war years. Seven years after this discovery of mesons by DM Bose and Bibha Chowdhuri, C.F. Powell made the same discovery of pions and muons and further decay of muons to electrons… using the same technique&quot;. He acknowledged in his book, &quot;In 1941, Bose and Chaudhuri (sic) had pointed it out that it is possible, in principle, to distinguish between the tracks of protons and mesons in an emulsion… They concluded that many of the charged particles arrested in their plates were lighter than protons, their mean mass being … the physical basis of their method was correct and their work represents the first approach to the scattering method of determining momenta of charged particles by observation of their tracks in emulsion&quot;. In fact, the measured mass of the particle by Bose and Chowdhuri was very close to the accepted value measured by Powell who used improved &quot;full-tone&quot; plates. From 1952 Powell was appointed director of several expeditions to Sardinia and the Po Valley, Italy, utilizing high-altitude balloon flights.

In 1955, Powell, also a member of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, added his signature to the Russell-Einstein Manifesto put forward by Bertrand Russell, Albert Einstein and scientist Joseph Rotblat, and was involved in preparations for the first Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs. As Rotblat put it, &quot;Cecil Powell has been the backbone of the Pugwash Movement. He gave it coherence, endurance and vitality.&quot; Powell chaired the meetings of the Pugwash Continuing Committee, often standing in for Bertrand Russell, and attended meetings until 1968.

In 1961 Powell received the Royal Medal, and served on the Scientific Policy Committee of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) that year, and in 1967 he was awarded the Lomonosov Gold Medal by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now Russian Academy of Sciences) &quot;for outstanding achievements in the physics of elementary particles&quot;.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Death ==

Powell died while on holiday with his wife in the Valsassina region of Italy, lodging in a house in Sanico, in the Province of Lecco. On 9 August 1969, near the end of a walk in the foothills of the Alps, he suffered a heart attack. Giuseppe Occhialini had a wooden bench built with Powell&#x27;s name carved into a commemorative plaque, and then transported it to Premana, a village in the mountains above Lake Como. It was installed on the path where he died, outside the Rifugio Capanna Vittoria (now the Capanna Vittoria restaurant), on the Alpe Giumello, in Casargo. Occhialini&#x27;s reason was, &quot;...if that bench had already been there, Powell would probably have stopped to rest there&quot;.

== Legacy ==
* The Cecil F. Powell Memorial Medal was named in his honour by the European Physical Society.
* In October 2011 a replacement commemorative plaque was installed in Downside Road, Bristol.
* In 2013, the International Inner Wheel Club of Lecco, in Lombardy, Northern Italy, erected a sign in memory of Powell, close to where he died, at the Capanna Vittoria restaurant, on the Alpe Giumello, in Casargo.

<text>Jacques Lelong (occasionally Jacobus Longus; 19 April 1665 – 13 August 1721) was a French bibliographer born in Paris. He joined the Knights of Malta at the age of ten, but later joined the Oratorians.

He was a priest of the Oratory, and was librarian to the establishment of the Order in Paris, where he spent his life in seclusion. He first published a &quot;Bibliotheca Sacra&quot; (1709), an index of all the editions of the Bible, then a &quot;Bibliothèque historique de la France&quot; (1719), a volume of considerable size, containing 17,487 items to which Lelong sometimes appends useful notes.

His work is far from complete. He vainly hoped that his friend and successor Father Desmolets would continue it; but it was resumed by , a councillor of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Dijon, who spent fifteen years of his life and a great deal of money in rewriting the &quot;Bibliothèque historique&quot;. The first two volumes (1768 and 1769) contained as many as 29,143 items. Fevret de Fontette died on 16 February 1772, leaving the third volume almost finished. It appeared in 1772, thanks to Barbaud de La Bruyère, who later brought out the 4th and 5th volumes (1775 and 1778). In this new edition the &quot;Bibliothèque historique&quot; is a work of reference of the highest order; it is still of great value.

<text>The Philokalia (, from &quot;philia&quot; &quot;love&quot; and &quot;kallos&quot; &quot;beauty&quot;) is &quot;a collection of texts written between the 4th and 15th centuries by spiritual masters&quot; of the mystical hesychast tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church. They were originally written for the guidance and instruction of monks in &quot;the practice of the contemplative life&quot;. The collection was compiled in the 18th century by Nicodemus the Hagiorite and Macarius of Corinth based on the codices 472 (12th century), 605 (13th century), 476 (14th century), 628 (14th century) and 629 (15th century) from the library of the monastery of Vatopedi, Mount Athos.

Although these works were individually known in the monastic culture of Greek Orthodox Christianity before their inclusion in the &quot;Philokalia&quot;, their presence in this collection resulted in a much wider readership due to its translation into several languages. The earliest translations included a Church Slavonic language translation of selected texts by Paisius Velichkovsky (&quot;Dobrotolublye&quot;, &quot;Добротолю́бїе&quot;) in 1793, a Russian translation by Ignatius Bryanchaninov in 1857, and a five-volume translation into Russian (&quot;Dobrotolyubie&quot;) by Theophan the Recluse in 1877. There were subsequent Romanian, Italian, French, German, Spanish, Finnish and Arabic translations.

The book is the &quot;principal spiritual text&quot; for all the Eastern Orthodox churches. The publishers of the current English translation state that &quot;the &quot;Philokalia&quot; has exercised an influence far greater than that of any book other than the Bible in the recent history of the Orthodox Church.&quot;

&quot;Philokalia&quot; (sometimes &quot;Philocalia&quot;) is also the name given to an anthology of the writings of Origen compiled by Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus. Other works on monastic spirituality have also used the same title over the years.

==History==
Nikodemos and Makarios were monks at Mount Athos, a mountainous peninsula in northern Greece, historically considered the geographical center of Orthodox spirituality and home to 20 monasteries. The first edition, in Greek, was published in Venice in 1782, with a second Greek edition published in Athens in 1893. All the original texts were in Greek—two of them were first written in Latin and translated into Greek in the Byzantine era.

Paisius Velichkovsky&#x27;s translation into Church Slavonic, &quot;Dobrotolublye&quot; (published in Moscow in 1793), included selected portions of the &quot;Philokalia&quot; and was the version that the pilgrim in &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot; carried on his journey. That book about a Russian pilgrim who is seeking advice on interior prayer helped popularize the &quot;Philokalia&quot; and its teachings in Russia. Velichkovsky&#x27;s translation was the first to become widely read by the public, away from the monasteries—helped by the popularity of &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot;, and the public influence of the &quot;startsy&quot; at Optina Monastery known as the Optina Elders. Two Russian language translations appeared in the 19th century, one by Ignatius Brianchaninov (1857) and another by Theophan the Recluse&#x27;s &quot;Dobrotolubiye&quot; (1877). The latter was published in five volumes and included texts that were not in the original Greek edition.

Velichkovsky was initially hesitant to share his translation outside of the Optina Monastery walls. He was concerned that people living in the world would not have the adequate supervision and guidance of the &quot;startsy&quot; in the monastery, nor would they have the support of the liturgical life of the monks. He was finally persuaded by the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg to publish the book in 1793. Brianchanivov expressed the same concerns in his work, warning his readers that regular practice of the Jesus Prayer, without adequate guidance, could cause spiritual delusion and pride, even among monks. Their concerns were contrary to the original compiler of the &quot;Philokalia&quot;, Nicodemos, who wrote that the Jesus Prayer could be used to good effect by anyone, whether monastic or layperson. All agreed that the teachings on constant inner prayer should be practiced under the guidance of a spiritual teacher, or &quot;starets&quot;.

The first partial English and French translations in the 1950s were an indirect result of the Bolshevik revolution, which brought many Russian intellectuals into Western Europe. T. S. Eliot persuaded his fellow directors of the publishing house Faber and Faber to publish a partial translation into English from the Theophan Russian version, which met with surprising success in 1951. A more complete English translation, from the original Greek, began in 1979 with a collaboration between G. E. H. Palmer, Kallistos Ware, and Philip Sherrard. They released four of the five volumes of the &quot;Philokalia&quot; between 1979 and 1995; the fifth and final volume was published in 2023, shortly after the death of the last surviving editor, Kallistos Ware. In 1946, the first installment of a ten volume Romanian translation by Father Dumitru Stăniloae appeared. In addition to the original Greek text, Stăniloae added &quot;lengthy original footnotes of his own&quot; as well as substantially expanding the coverage of texts by Saint John of the Ladder, Saint Dorotheos of Gaza, Maximus the Confessor, Symeon the New Theologian, and Gregory Palamas. This work is 4,650 pages in length. Writings by the Trappist monk Thomas Merton on hesychasm also helped spread the popularity of the &quot;Philokalia&quot;, along with the indirect influence of J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, which featured &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot; as a main plot element.

==Teachings==
The collection&#x27;s title is The Philokalia of the Niptic Fathers, or more fully &quot;The Philokalia of the Neptic Saints gathered from our Holy Theophoric Father, through which, by means of the philosophy of ascetic practice and contemplation, the intellect is purified, illumined, and made perfect.&quot; &quot;Niptic&quot; is an adjective derived from the Greek &quot;Nipsis&quot; (or &quot;Nepsis&quot;) referring to contemplative prayer and meaning &quot;watchfulness&quot;. Watchfulness in this context includes close attention to one&#x27;s thoughts, intentions, and emotions, with the aim of resisting temptations and vain and egoistic thoughts, and trying to maintain a constant state of remembrance of God. There are similarities between this ancient practice and the concept of mindfulness as practiced in Buddhism and other spiritual traditions. The &quot;Philokalia&quot; teachings have also influenced the revival of interior prayer in modern times through the centering prayer practices taught by Thomas Keating and Thomas Merton.

&quot;Philokalia&quot; is defined as the &quot;love of the beautiful, the exalted, the excellent, understood as the transcendent source of life and the revelation of Truth.&quot; In contemplative prayer the mind becomes absorbed in the awareness of God as a living presence as the source of being of all creatures and sensible forms. According to the authors of the English translation, Kallistos Ware, G. E. H. Palmer, and Philip Sherrard, the writings of the &quot;Philokalia&quot; have been chosen above others because they:
...show the way to awaken and develop attention and consciousness, to attain that state of watchfulness which is the hallmark of sanctity. They describe the conditions most effective for learning what their authors call the art of arts and the science of sciences, a learning which is not a matter of information or agility of mind but of a radical change of will and heart leading man towards the highest possibilities open to him, shaping and nourishing the unseen part of his being, and helping him to spiritual fulfilment and union with God.&quot;

The &quot;Philokalia&quot; is the foundational text on hesychasm (&quot;quietness&quot; or &quot;stillness&quot;), an inner spiritual tradition with a long history dating back to the Desert Fathers. The practices include contemplative prayer, quiet sitting, and recitation of the Jesus Prayer. While traditionally taught and practiced in monasteries, hesychasm teachings have spread over the years to include laymen. Nikodemos, in his introduction, described the collected texts as &quot;a mystical school of inward prayer&quot; which could be used to cultivate the inner life and to &quot;attain the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&quot; While the monastic life makes this easier, Nikodemos himself stressed that &quot;unceasing prayer&quot; should be practiced by all.

The hesychast teachings in the &quot;Philokalia&quot; are viewed by Orthodox Christians as inseparable from the sacraments and liturgy of the Orthodox Church, and are given by and for those who are already living within the framework of the Church. A common theme is the need for a spiritual father or guide.

<text>Edward Mills Purcell (August 30, 1912 – March 7, 1997) was an American physicist who shared the 1952 Nobel Prize for Physics for his independent discovery (published 1946) of nuclear magnetic resonance in liquids and in solids. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become widely used to study the molecular structure of pure materials and the composition of mixtures. Friends and colleagues knew him as Ed Purcell.

==Biography==
Born and raised in Taylorville, Illinois, Purcell received his BSEE in electrical engineering from Purdue University, followed by his M.A. and Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University. He was a member of the Alpha Xi chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity while at Purdue. After spending the years of World War II working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory on the development of microwave radar, Purcell returned to Harvard to do research. In December 1945, he discovered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with his colleagues Robert Pound and Henry Torrey. NMR provides scientists with an elegant and precise way of determining chemical structure and properties of materials, and is widely used in physics and chemistry. It also is the basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one of the most important medical advances of the 20th century. For his discovery of NMR, Purcell shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in physics with Felix Bloch of Stanford University.

Purcell also made contributions to astronomy as the first to detect radio emissions from neutral galactic hydrogen (the famous 21 cm line due to hyperfine splitting), affording the first views of the spiral arms of the Milky Way. This observation helped launch the field of radio astronomy, and measurements of the 21 cm line are still an important technique in modern astronomy. He has also made seminal contributions to solid state physics, with studies of spin-echo relaxation, nuclear magnetic relaxation, and negative spin temperature (important in the development of the laser). With Norman F. Ramsey, he was the first to question the CP symmetry of particle physics.

Purcell was the recipient of many awards for his scientific, educational, and civic work. He served as science advisor to Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson. He was president of the American Physical Society, and a member of the American Philosophical Society, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1979, and the Jansky Lectureship before the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. Purcell was also inducted into his Fraternity&#x27;s (Phi Kappa Sigma) Hall of Fame as the first Phi Kap ever to receive a Nobel Prize.

Purcell was the author of the innovative introductory text &quot;Electricity and Magnetism&quot;. The book, a Sputnik-era project funded by an NSF grant, was influential for its use of relativity in the presentation of the subject at this level. The 1965 edition, now freely available due to a condition of the federal grant, was originally published as a volume of the &quot;Berkeley Physics Course&quot;. The book is also in print as a commercial third edition, as Purcell and Morin. Purcell is also remembered by biologists for his famous lecture &quot;Life at Low Reynolds Number&quot;, in which he explained forces and effects dominating in limiting flow regimes (often at the micro scale). He also emphasized the time-reversibility of low Reynolds number flows with a principle referred to as the Scallop theorem.

Purcell died on March 7, 1997, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, aged 84.

<text>Polykarp Kusch (; January 26, 1911 – March 20, 1993) was a German-American physicist who shared the 1955 Nobel Prize in Physics with Willis Eugene Lamb for his accurate determination that the electron magnetic moment was greater than its theoretical value, thus leading to reconsideration of and innovations in quantum electrodynamics.

==Early life and education==
Kusch was born in Blankenburg, Germany to John Mathias Kusch, a Lutheran missionary, and his wife, Henrietta van der Haas. In 1912, Kusch and his family had emigrated to the United States, where by 1922 he became a naturalized citizen. After graduating from grade school in the Midwest, Kusch attended Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio (now known as Case Western Reserve University), where he majored in physics. After graduating from the Case Western Reserve University with bachelor of science degree in 1931, Kusch joined University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, from where he received his master&#x27;s degree in 1933. He continued his education at the same alma mater, studying for his Ph.D. under mentorship from F. Wheeler Loomis and after defending his thesis titled &quot;The Molecular Spectrum of Caesium and Rubidium&quot;, graduated from it in 1936. In 1935, prior to moving to the University of Minnesota, Kusch married his girlfriend, Edith Starr Roberts. Together, they had three daughters.

==Career==
Kusch then moved to New York City, where from 1937 and until his departure for the newly founded University of Texas at Dallas, he spent much of his career as a professor at Columbia University, and served as the university&#x27;s provost for several years. He worked on molecular beam resonance studies under I. I. Rabi, then discovered the electron anomalous magnetic moment. Many measurements of magnetic moments and hyperfine structure followed. He expanded into chemical physics and continued to publish research on molecular beams. During his tenure at Columbia, he was the doctoral supervisor for Gordon Gould, the inventor of the laser.

Kusch was a fellow of the American Physical Society since 1940 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1959. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1956. In 1967, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Kusch&#x27;s wife Edith died in 1959, and in the following year he married Betty Pezzoni. They had two daughters. Kusch House, a residential dormitory for undergraduate students at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio on the South Campus, is named after Kusch. It is located on Carlton Road in Cleveland Heights. The University of Texas at Dallas has a Polykarp Kusch Auditorium with a plaque.

Kusch died on March 20, 1993, aged 82. His widow Betty died in 2003, aged 77.

<text>Avi Ran (August 25, 1963 – July 11, 1987) was a goalkeeper at the Israeli football club Maccabi Haifa. Widely considered one of the greatest football players in Israel, he had a promising future which was cut short by a fatal accident.

==Football career==

Ran made his debut in Haifa&#x27;s senior team in the 1981–82 season at the age of 17 in a match against Maccabi Tel Aviv, keeping a clean sheet in the process. Ran went on to play for most of the season, competing for his place in the team with Zadok Avrahami. The competition was tough, but Ran was known for his perseverance and diligence in training, as well as his good manners and social character - which earned him a social status of loud and sympathetic off the pitch.

During the 1983–84 season Shlomo Scharf came to Maccabi Haifa. Looking for a new coach and veteran instead of 20-year-old Ran, he attempted to release Ran and replace him with Arie Haviv from Hapoel Yehud. Being a popular social figure in the group, a wave of protests occurred from a number of players, such as Baruch Maman and Ronnie Rosenthal, who requested that Scharf let him stay, but he would not listen to them. Yohanan Volach, who was key in preventing the release of many players (including Rosenthal, Moshe Selektar, Rafi Osmo and Yossi Kremer), torpedoed the move and managed to prevent the release of Ran. Volach believed in the young goalkeeper, and knew of his ability and potential from when he was a child.

Ran did not disappoint, and his performances for Haifa revealed an excellent goalkeeper. Ya&#x27;akov Hodorov. Ran helped to Haifa to win the first Israeli Premier League title in its history, conceding only 28 goals. In Ran&#x27;s second season he was already established as one of Maccabi Haifa&#x27;s key players Maccabi Haifa, and again impressed as he broke a club record, conceding only 18 goals as Haifa won the title for the second year in succession. That season saw Haifa come close to winning the double as they also reached the cup final, although they lost to Beitar Jerusalem. In 1986, Maccabi Haifa came close to success again, topping the table for most of the season. However, the Championship was won by Hapoel Tel Aviv on the final day, as they faced off with Haifa in a game that would decide the title winners. With Haifa sitting just 1 point above second placed Tel Aviv, an 86th minute goal by Gili Landau, which was later adjudged to have been offside, won Tel Aviv the title by just 2 points. Ran excelled that year and was named player of the season, although his team narrowly lost the championship.

That same year saw Haifa play outside of Israel for the first time. Rumours circulated of a possible move for Ran to a European club, including Liverpool. Exhibition games were held in Israel, and Ran played one of the best games in his career. Liverpool were very impressed by the showing of Haifa and wanted to sign him. Ran played nine games the team, eight of which resulted in a loss, and one a draw.

In 1987, Maccabi Haifa finished low down in the table in ninth place, but Ran maintained his status as a key player, although many other key players were released from the club.

* Won 2 championships with Maccabi Haifa.
* Conceded only 18 goals in the 1985–86 season, the lowest in Maccabi Haifa&#x27;s history.
* Won Maariv&#x27;s 1986 &quot;footballer of the year&quot; award (i.e. the MVP of the season).
* Was goalkeeper of the Israel national team.

==Fatal accident==

On 11 July 1987, Ran was killed on the &quot;Guy&quot; beach in Tiberias when he was hit by a passing racing boat whilst Maccabi Haifa were on a vacation off season in the Sea of Galilee. 14,000 people attended Ran&#x27;s funeral.

==Legacy==
Ran would be honored by Maccabi Haifa with a stand being named in his honor. As well as having a street named after him in Kiryat Eliezer, the neighborhood Maccabi Haifa used to play in. He was also honored with a postal stamp where he is seen playing for the Israel national team. Ran received a statue outside of Ramat Gan Stadium as well.

The Israel Youth State Cup is named in his honor.

<doc id="396543" wikidata="Q2132031" url="?curid=396543" title="Rally of the French People">
<text>The Rally of the French People ( , RPF) was a French political party, led by Charles de Gaulle.

==Foundation==
The RPF was founded by Charles de Gaulle in Strasbourg on 14 April 1947, one year after his resignation from the presidency of the provisional government and four months after the proclamation of the Fourth Republic. It advocated a constitutional revision establishing a presidential government. For de Gaulle, the &quot;regime of the parties&quot; which characterized the parliamentary system did not permit the advent of a strong and efficient state. However, in French Republican culture, democracy and parliamentary sovereignty were inseparable. De Gaulle was accused of wanting to establish a Bonapartist government, with himself as the single dominant ruler.

As de Gaulle also opposed the parties on the basis that they served particular interests and divided the nation, he wanted the RPF to be a &quot;rally,&quot; not a political party, and allowed members of other parties (except Communists and former Vichy regime supporters) to join without compromising their other membership, but this hope was never realized. By 1948, the party counted half a million members, just behind the Communist Party. The RPF was able to gain the support of Maurrasien royalists (of the Action Française), leftist republicans such as André Malraux, moderates, Christian democrats such as Edmond Michelet, radicals such as Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Michel Debré, and even socialists and communists. Nevertheless, most of its voters came from the right-wing electorate.

==Electoral record==
The party enjoyed success in municipal elections (1947), capturing the cities of Lille, Marseille, Bordeaux (with Jacques Chaban-Delmas), Strasbourg, Rennes, Versailles, Le Mans, and Nancy with over 35% of votes. In Paris in 1947, Pierre de Gaulle, the brother of the General, became President of the municipal council, a post similar to mayor. However, the RPF&#x27;s performance in the Christian Democratic MRP strongholds of rural France was relatively mediocre. Parliamentarians hostile to the RPF delayed cantonal elections in the fear of another Gaullist breakthrough. The hostility of the media and the social events of 1947 limited the party&#x27;s electoral success. 

The 1949 cantonal elections, albeit delayed in fear of an RPF breakthrough, produced another RPF victory (although smaller than the victory in the municipal elections).

The 1951 election was a relative success for the RPF, but the electoral law (&quot;apparentements&quot;), created to favor the Third Force coalition (MRP, SFIO, RGR etc.) over the anti-Fourth Republic parties (RPF and the Communists), limited the Gaullist breakthrough. It obtained over 4 million votes (22.3%) and 117 seats. It had hoped for over 200 seats, which the &quot;apparentements&quot; prevented.

==Political defeats==
With only 117 seats, the RPF had little influence on decision making in the new Assembly. In 1952, 27 deputies voted in favor of Antoine Pinay&#x27;s government before being excluded. Later, 45 other deputies left the Gaullist party. Following the loss of numerous cities, including Marseille and Lille, in the 1953 municipal elections, the party&#x27;s decline started. Many people blamed its defeats on an authoritarian party leadership. De Gaulle asked the Gaullist deputies to abandon the name &quot;RPF&quot;, then in June 1953, five Gaullist deputies joined Joseph Laniel&#x27;s government. In 1954, the vote of Gaullists and Communists lead to the defeat of the European Defence Community treaty.

On 13 September 1955, the party was officially dissolved. The Gaullist deputies founded the National Centre of Social Republicans without the backing of de Gaulle. Most would go on to form the Union for the New Republic and help create the Fifth Republic in 1958.

<text>Jeffrey Dean Isbell (born April 8, 1962), known professionally as Izzy Stradlin, is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He was a co-founder, rhythm guitarist, and backing vocalist of the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, with whom he recorded four studio albums and left at the height of their fame in 1991.

Following his departure from Guns N&#x27; Roses, Stradlin fronted his own rock band, Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds, before continuing to record as a solo artist. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses in 2012.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===
Stradlin was born 1962 in Lafayette, Indiana. His father, Richard Clyde Isbell, was an engraver. His mother, Sonja LaVern Isbell, née Reagan, worked for a phone company. Stradlin has stated that he &quot;grew up in Florida and moved with my mom to Lafayette.&quot; His parents divorced when Stradlin was eight. His mother moved Stradlin and his two younger brothers, Kevin Thomas Isbell and Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Isbell to Lafayette, Indiana. Of his hometown, Stradlin said, &quot;It was cool growing up there. There&#x27;s a courthouse and a college, a river and railroad tracks. It&#x27;s a small town, so there wasn&#x27;t much to do. We rode bikes, smoked pot, got into trouble—it was pretty &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; actually.&quot; Izzy&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s half-brother, Joseph William &quot;Little Joe&quot; Isbell, was born 1916. He was also a recording and touring artist, described as a &quot;country yodeler&quot;.

Stradlin developed an interest in music early in life; by the age of eight, his musical favorites included Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Alice Cooper, and Led Zeppelin. His biggest musical influence was his paternal grandmother, who played drums in a swing jazz band with her friends. Inspired, Stradlin talked his parents into buying him a drum kit.

In high school, Stradlin started a band with his friends, one of whom was singer William Bailey, later known as Axl Rose. Stradlin recalled, &quot;We were long-haired guys in high school. You were either a jock or a stoner. We weren&#x27;t jocks, so we ended up hanging out together. We&#x27;d play covers in the garage. There were no clubs to play at, so we never made it out of the garage.&quot; Despite his aversion to school, Stradlin graduated in 1980 with a D average, the only original member of Guns N&#x27; Roses with a high school diploma. Set on a career in music, he subsequently moved to Los Angeles.

=== 1980–1984: Career beginnings ===
Shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles, Stradlin joined punk band Naughty Women. During his ill-fated first show with the band, audience members began attacking the musicians; Stradlin recalled, &quot;I just grabbed a cymbal stand and stood on the side trying to fend them off, yelling, &#x27;Get the fuck away from me, man!&#x27; That was my introduction to the rock scene in L.A.&quot; His two-month tenure in Naughty Women was followed by a stint in punk band The Atoms, before his drum kit was stolen from his car and he switched to bass. Stradlin then joined the heavy metal band Shire, during which he took up rhythm guitar to aid his songwriting.

In 1983, Stradlin formed Hollywood Rose with childhood friend Axl Rose, who had moved to Los Angeles the previous year. In January 1984, the band recorded a five-song demo featuring the tracks &quot;Killing Time&quot;, &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, &quot;Rocker&quot;, &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot;, and &quot;Reckless Life&quot;, which were released in 2004 as part of the compilation album &quot;The Roots of Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;. The group disbanded in August, following which Stradlin briefly joined Sunset Strip staple London. He also formed the short-lived band Stalin with singer Eric Leach and guitarist Taz Rudd of Symbol Six. In December, he reunited with Hollywood Rose.

=== 1985–1991: Guns N&#x27; Roses ===

In March 1985, Stradlin founded Guns N&#x27; Roses with Axl Rose and members of L.A. Guns, Tracii Guns, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner, as a favor to L.A. Guns manager, Raz Cue, who had previously booked the act at the Troubadour. By June, the lineup consisted of Rose, guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. They played nightclubs—such as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadour—and opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. During this period, the band wrote much of its classic material, and Stradlin established himself as a key songwriter.

In July 1987, Guns N&#x27; Roses released their debut album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, which has sold over 28 million copies worldwide, including 18 million in the United States alone. Stradlin wrote or cowrote most of its songs, including the hits &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; and &quot;Paradise City&quot;. He also wrote the hit &quot;Patience&quot; on the follow-up &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot;, released in November 1988 to US sales of five million copies, despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot;.

As their success grew, so did tensions within the band. In 1989, opening for The Rolling Stones, Rose made an on-stage announcement in which he threatened to leave the band if Slash and Adler did not stop &quot;dancing with Mr. Brownstone,&quot; a reference to their song of the same name about heroin. After being sentenced to a year&#x27;s probation for urinating in public aboard an airplane (after which the band nicknamed him &quot;Whizzy&quot;), Stradlin decided to attain sobriety; he returned to his house in Indiana, where he detoxed from drugs and alcohol. 

In September 1991, Guns N&#x27; Roses released the long-awaited &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 respectively in the US chart – an unprecedented feat. Stradlin cowrote the hits &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;, and performed lead vocals on &quot;Dust N&#x27; Bones&quot;, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t the First&quot;, &quot;Double Talkin&#x27; Jive&quot;, and &quot;14 Years&quot;. As with their previous records, his preferred guitar during recording was a Gibson ES-175.

By the release of the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums, Stradlin had become dissatisfied with life in Guns N&#x27; Roses: &quot;Once I quit drugs, I couldn&#x27;t help looking around and asking myself, &#x27;Is this all there is?&#x27; I was just tired of it; I needed to get out.&quot; On November 7, 1991, it was announced that he had left Guns N&#x27; Roses, having played his final show as an official member on August 31 at Wembley Stadium.

Stradlin later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the complications that became such a part of daily life in Guns N&#x27; Roses,&quot; citing the Riverport riot and Axl Rose&#x27;s chronic lateness and diva behavior on the Use Your Illusion Tour as examples. He also objected to a contract with which he was presented: &quot;This is right before I left – demoting me to some lower position. They were gonna cut my percentage of royalties down. I was like, &#x27;Fuck you! I&#x27;ve been there from Day One. Why should I do that? Fuck you, I&#x27;ll go play the Whisky.&#x27; That&#x27;s what happened. It was utterly insane.&quot;

Stradlin added that getting sober played a part in his decision to leave, saying, &quot;When you&#x27;re fucked up, you&#x27;re more likely to put up with things you wouldn&#x27;t normally put up with.&quot;

Some of Stradlin&#x27;s guitar playing recorded during the &quot;Illusion&quot; sessions appears on Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; 1993 covers album &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;, although he was uncredited on the project.

=== 1992–1994: Ju Ju Hounds and first return to Guns N&#x27; Roses ===
Following his departure from Guns N&#x27; Roses, Stradlin returned to his hometown of Lafayette, Indiana, where he began working on new material. He formed the band Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds, which consisted of Stradlin on vocals and rhythm guitar, Rick Richards of Georgia Satellites on lead guitar, Jimmy Ashhurst of Broken Homes on bass, and Charlie Quintana on drums. Their self-titled debut album was released in October 1992 to positive reviews; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a ragged, blues-drenched, and thoroughly winning solo debut.&quot; Ju Ju Hounds played its first show in September at The Avalon in Chicago, before embarking on a tour of Europe, Australia, and North America.

In May 1993, Stradlin reunited with Guns N&#x27; Roses for five shows in Europe and the Middle East to fill in for his replacement, Gilby Clarke, who had broken his wrist in a motorcycle accident. After Stradlin returned to the Ju Ju Hounds, Axl Rose dedicated the Stradlin-penned &quot;Double Talkin&#x27; Jive&quot; to him during several shows. In September, the Ju Ju Hounds undertook a tour of Japan, where the band played its final show at the Shibuya Public Hall in Tokyo. Stradlin then took time off from music unannounced, leaving the Ju Ju Hounds and going to the Bahamas, traveling extensively and dedicating much of his time to his other passions—motor racing, skateboarding and even building a motor track close to his Indiana home.

=== 1995–2002: Solo career and Velvet Revolver ===
In 1995, Stradlin began recording material for his first solo album, &quot;117°&quot;. Released in March 1998, the album was recorded over a period of two years and featured his former bandmates Duff McKagan and Rick Richards, as well as former Reverend Horton Heat drummer Taz Bentley, whose work Stradlin admired. As before, Stradlin had little interest in promoting his music; he did few interviews and played no live performances. The album turned out to be his last release on his long-time label Geffen; as a result of the merger of Geffen and Interscope, Stradlin was dropped from the label&#x27;s roster.

In December 1999, Stradlin&#x27;s next solo album, &quot;Ride On&quot;, was released on the Universal Victor label in Japan. It featured the same lineup as his previous release. To promote the album, Stradlin—with McKagan, Richards, and Bentley—played four shows in Japan the following April. With the addition of keyboardist Ian McLagan, the group recorded two more albums: &quot;River&quot;, which was released in May 2001 on Sanctuary, and a second Japan-only release, &quot;On Down the Road&quot;, which followed in August 2002 on JVC Victor.

Stradlin was then asked by his former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates Duff McKagan, Slash, and Matt Sorum to join the supergroup Velvet Revolver. Although he contributed to the songwriting process while the band was in its formative stage, Stradlin ultimately declined to join due to his aversion to life on the road and his unwillingness to work with a lead singer, although he offered to share vocal duties with McKagan.

=== 2003–2010: Independent solo career and second return to Guns N&#x27; Roses ===
In 2003, Stradlin recorded his sixth album, &quot;Like a Dog&quot;, with guitarist Rick Richards, drummer Taz Bentley, and bassist JT Longoria. It was originally scheduled for a late 2003 release, with just under one thousand promo copies made. However, the album was not released until October 2005, when Stradlin—prompted by a fan petition—made it available through internet order. The following year, Stradlin re-released &quot;Ride On&quot;, &quot;River&quot;, &quot;On Down the Road&quot;, and &quot;Like a Dog&quot; through iTunes.

In May 2006, thirteen years after his last performance with Guns N&#x27; Roses, Stradlin made a guest appearance at the band&#x27;s show at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York; he played on &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Think About You&quot;, and &quot;Nightrain&quot;. He then performed with Guns N&#x27; Roses for 13 shows during the band&#x27;s summer European tour. Stradlin said, &quot;Axl [Rose] and I connected via cell phone this year, I stopped by. It was nice to reconnect with an old friend/war buddy/fellow musician. I told him later I&#x27;d like to join the fun in some way and he said I was welcome to come and play something, so I did! Took me about three weeks to recover from the six weeks of touring!&quot; In December, he played three shows with the group at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California.

Stradlin released his seventh album, &quot;Miami&quot;, through iTunes in May 2007. It again featured Rick Richards, Taz Bentley, and JT Longoria, as well as keyboardist Joey Huffman. Guitarist Richards described the album as being &quot;a bit of a departure from &quot;Like a Dog&quot; but still quite a rocker.&quot; In July, a remixed version of &quot;Miami&quot; was released through iTunes; Stradlin called the new mix &quot;much louder and more powerful sounding.&quot; In November of that year, he released a second iTunes-only album, &quot;Fire, the Acoustic Album&quot;, which also featured Richards, Bentley, and Longoria.

Stradlin&#x27;s next iTunes release, &quot;Concrete&quot;, came out in July 2008. In addition to his regular collaborators, Stradlin also invited Duff McKagan to play bass on three songs, including the title track. Stradlin then released two more albums through iTunes: &quot;Smoke&quot;, which came out in December 2009, and &quot;Wave of Heat&quot;, which followed in July 2010 and again featured McKagan, who appears on seven tracks. Also in 2010, Stradlin appeared as a guest on Slash&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Slash&quot;; he performs rhythm guitar on the first track, &quot;Ghost&quot;.

=== 2011–present: Hall of Fame induction and third return to Guns N&#x27; Roses ===
In April 2012, Stradlin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the classic lineup of Guns N&#x27; Roses. In a statement released through Duff McKagan&#x27;s blog for &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;, he thanked the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &quot;for the acknowledgement of our works over the years,&quot; his former bandmates, and his fans for their continuing support. Known to avoid public attention, Stradlin did not attend the induction ceremony.

In the month following the induction, Stradlin joined Guns N&#x27; Roses on stage during two shows at London&#x27;s O2 Arena, where they performed a range of songs including &quot;14 Years,&quot; which had not been performed live since his departure in 1991. He also performed with Guns N&#x27; Roses in July, at a private show in Saint-Tropez and a concert in Palma de Mallorca, and again in November, during the last two shows of the band&#x27;s twelve-date &quot;Appetite for Democracy&quot; residency in Las Vegas. Also in November, Stradlin released the iTunes-only single &quot;Baby-Rann&quot;—his first release in over two years; an accompanying video was made available via YouTube.

Amidst rumors and speculation, Stradlin joined Twitter, and confirmed in a statement to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he would not be involved with the &#x27;reunited&#x27; Guns N&#x27; Roses lineup in 2016. He later stated that he declined because the band &quot;didn&#x27;t want to split the loot equally&quot;. In 2018, journalist Alan Niven reported that Stradlin participated in a soundcheck with Guns N&#x27; Roses sometime in 2017, but ultimately left before guesting at the show.

Stradlin released numerous singles in 2016, previewing samples of the songs via his Twitter account and through the YouTube channel &#x27;classicrockstuffs&#x27;. &quot;Sunshine&quot; by Jonathon Edwards and &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; by Stealers Wheel were acoustic videos made available through YouTube, whilst &quot;Walk N&#x27; Song&quot;, &quot;F.P. Money&quot; (featuring former Guns N&#x27; Roses drummer Matt Sorum), &quot;To Being Alive&quot; and a cover version of the J. J. Cale song &quot;Call Me the Breeze&quot; featuring Jesse Aycock and Lauren Barth, were released to online music stores.

In 2017, Stradlin played guitar on the song &quot;Grandview&quot; by John Mellencamp, on his album &quot;Sad Clowns &amp; Hillbillies&quot;. Martina McBride was also featured on the song.

<text>Ilya Mikhailovich Frank (; 23 October 1908 – 22 June 1990) was a Soviet physicist who received the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov and Igor Y. Tamm, also of the Soviet Union. He received the award for his work in explaining the phenomenon of Cherenkov radiation. He received the Stalin prize in 1946 and 1953 and the USSR state prize in 1971.

==Life and career==
Ilya Frank was born on 23 October 1908 in St. Petersburg. His father, Mikhail Lyudvigovich Frank, was a talented mathematician descended from a Jewish family, while his mother, Yelizaveta Mikhailovna Gratsianova, was a Russian Orthodox physician. His father participated in the student revolutionary movement, and as a result was expelled from Moscow University. After the October Revolution, he was reinstated and appointed professor. Ilya&#x27;s uncle, Semyon Frank, a noted Russian philosopher, wasn&#x27;t as fortunate and was expelled from the USSR in 1922 together with 160 other intellectuals. Ilya had one elder brother, Gleb Mikhailovich Frank, who became an eminent biophysicist and member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

Ilya Frank studied mathematics and theoretical physics at Moscow State University. From his second year he worked in the laboratory of Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov, whom he regarded as his mentor. After graduating in 1930, on recommendation of Vavilov, he started working at the State Optical Institute in Leningrad. There he wrote his first publication—about luminescence— with Vavilov. The work he did there would form the basis of his doctoral dissertation in 1935.

In 1934, Frank moved to the Institute of Physics and Mathematics of the USSR Academy of Sciences (which shortly would be moved to Moscow, where it was transformed into the Institute of Physics). Here he started working on nuclear physics, a new field for him. He became interested in the effect discovered by Pavel Cherenkov, that charged particles moving through water at high speeds emit light. Together with Igor Tamm, he developed a theoretical explanation: the effect occurs when charged particles travel through an optically transparent medium at speeds greater than the speed of light in that medium, causing a shock wave in the electromagnetic field. The amount of energy radiated in this process is given by the Frank–Tamm formula.

The discovery and explanation of the effect resulted in the development of new methods for detecting and measuring the velocity of high-speed nuclear particles and became of great importance for research in nuclear physics. Cherenkov radiation is also widely used in biomedical research for detection of radioactive isotopes. In 1946, Cherenkov, Vavilov, Tamm, and Frank were awarded a Stalin Prize for their discovery, and 1958 Cherenkov, Tamm, and Frank received the Nobel Prize in Physics.

In 1944, Frank was appointed professor and became head of a department at the Institute of Physics and of the Nuclear Physics Laboratory (which was later transferred to the Institute of Nuclear Research). Frank&#x27;s laboratory was involved in the (then secret) study of nuclear reactors. In particular, they studied the diffusion and thermalization of neutrons.

In 1957, Frank also become director of the Laboratory of Neutron Physics at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The laboratory was based on the neutron fast-pulse reactor (IBR) then under construction at the site. Under Frank&#x27;s supervision the reactor was used in the development of neutron spectroscopy techniques.

==Personal life and death==
Frank married the noted historian, Ella Abramovna Beilikhis, in 1937. Their son, Alexander, was born in the same year, and would continue much of the studies of his father as a physicist.

Frank died on 22 June 1990 in Moscow at the age 81.

<text>In transportation, cargo refers to goods transported by land, water or air, while freight refers to its conveyance. In economics, freight refers to goods transported at a freight rate for commercial gain. The term cargo is also used in case of goods in the cold-chain, because the perishable inventory is always in transit towards a final end-use, even when it is held in cold storage or other similar climate-controlled facilities, including warehouses.

Multi-modal container units, designed as reusable carriers to facilitate unit load handling of the goods contained, are also referred to as cargo, especially by shipping lines and logistics operators. When empty containers are shipped each unit is documented as a cargo and when goods are stored within, the contents are termed containerized cargo. Similarly, aircraft ULD boxes are also documented as cargo, with an associated packing list of the items contained within.

== Description ==

===Marine===

Seaport terminals handle a wide range of maritime cargoes.

Break bulk / general cargo are goods that are handled and stowed piecemeal to some degree, as opposed to cargo in bulk or modern shipping containers. Typically bundled in batches for hoisting, either with cargo nets, slings, crates, or stacked on trays, pallets or skids; at best (and today mostly) lifted directly into and out of a vessel&#x27;s holds, but otherwise onto and off its deck, by cranes or derricks present on the dock or on the ship itself. If hoisted on deck instead of straight into the hold, liftable or rolling unit loads, like bags, barrels/vats, boxes, cartons and crates, then have to be man-handled and stowed competently by stevedores. Securing break bulk and general freight inside a vessel, includes the use of dunnage. When no hoisting equipment is available, break bulk would previously be man-carried on and off the ship, over a plank, or by passing via human chain. Since the 1960s, the volume of break bulk cargo has enormously declined worldwide in favour of mass adoption of containers.
Bulk cargo, such as salt, oil, tallow, but also scrap metal, is usually defined as commodities that are neither on pallets nor in containers. Bulk cargoes are not handled as individual pieces, the way heavy-lift and project cargo are. Alumina, grain, gypsum, logs, and wood chips, for instance, are bulk cargoes. Bulk cargo is classified as liquid or dry.

===Air===

Air cargo refers to any goods shipped by air, whereas air freight refers specifically to goods transported in the cargo hold of a dedicated cargo plane. Aircraft were first used to carry mail as cargo in 1911. Eventually manufacturers started designing aircraft for other types of freight as well.

There are many commercial aircraft suitable for carrying cargo such as the Boeing 747 and the more prominent An‑124, which was purposely built for easy conversion into a cargo aircraft. Such large aircraft employ standardized quick-loading containers known as unit load devices (ULDs), comparable to ISO containers on cargo ships. ULDs can be stowed in the lower decks (front and rear) of several wide-body aircraft, and on the main deck of some narrow-bodies. Some dedicated cargo planes have a large opening front for loading.

Air freight shipments are very similar to LTL shipments in terms of size and packaging requirements. However, air freight or air cargo shipments typically need to move at much faster speeds than per hour. While shipments move faster than standard LTL, air shipments do not always actually move by air. Air shipments may be booked directly with the carriers, through brokers or with online marketplace services. In the US, there are certain restrictions on cargo moving via air freight on passenger aircraft, most notably the transport of rechargeable lithium-ion battery shipments. 

Shippers in the US must be approved and be &quot;known&quot; in the Known Shipper Management System before their shipments can be tendered on passenger aircraft.

===Rail===


Trains are capable of transporting a large number of containers that come from shipping ports. Trains are also used to transport water, cement, grain, steel, wood and coal. They are used because they can carry a large amount and generally have a direct route to the destination. Under the right circumstances, freight transport by rail is more economical and energy efficient than by road, mainly when carried in bulk or over long distances.

The main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility. For this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to road transport. Rail freight is often subject to transshipment costs, since it must be transferred from one mode of transportation to another. Practices such as containerization aim at minimizing these costs. When transporting point-to-point bulk loads such as cement or grain, with specialised bulk handling facilities at the rail sidings, the rail mode of transport remains the most convenient and preferred option.

Many governments are encouraging shippers to increase their use of rail rather than transport because of trains&#x27; lower environmental disbenefits.
===Road===

Many firms, like Parcelforce, FedEx and R+L Carriers transport all types of cargo by road. Delivering everything from letters to houses to cargo containers, these firms offer fast, sometimes same-day, delivery.

A good example of road cargo is food, as supermarkets require deliveries daily to replenish their shelves with goods. Retailers and manufacturers of all kinds rely upon delivery trucks, be they full size semi trucks or smaller delivery vans. These smaller road haulage companies constantly strive for the best routes and prices to ship out their products. Indeed, the level of commercial freight transported by smaller businesses is often a good barometer of healthy economic development as these types of vehicles move and transport anything literally, including couriers transporting parcels and mail.
You can see the different types and weights of vehicles that are used to move cargo around .

====Less-than-truckload freight====

Less than truckload (LTL) cargo is the first category of freight shipment, representing the majority of freight shipments and the majority of business-to-business (B2B) shipments. LTL shipments are also often referred to as &quot;motor freight&quot; and the carriers involved are referred to as &quot;motor carriers&quot;.

LTL shipments range from , being less than the majority of times. The average single piece of LTL freight is and the size of a standard pallet. Long freight and/or large freight are subject to extreme length and cubic capacity surcharges.

Trailers used in LTL can range from . The standard for city deliveries is usually . In tight and residential environments the trailer is used the most.

The shipments are usually palletized, stretch [shrink]-wrapped and packaged for a mixed-freight environment. Unlike express or parcel, LTL shippers must provide their own packaging, as carriers do not provide any packaging supplies or assistance. However, circumstances may require crating or another substantial packaging.

====Truckload freight====

In the United States, shipments larger than about are typically classified as truckload (TL) freight. This is because it is more efficient and economical for a large shipment to have exclusive use of one larger trailer rather than share space on a smaller LTL trailer.

By the Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula the total weight of a loaded truck (tractor and trailer, 5-axle rig) cannot exceed in the United States. In ordinary circumstances, long-haul equipment will weigh about , leaving about of freight capacity. Similarly a load is limited to the space available in the trailer, normally or long, wide, high and high overall.

While express, parcel and LTL shipments are always intermingled with other shipments on a single piece of equipment and are typically reloaded across multiple pieces of equipment during their transport, TL shipments usually travel as the only shipment on a trailer. In fact, TL shipments usually deliver on exactly the same trailer as they are picked up on.

==== Shipment categories ====

* the type of item being carried. For example, a kettle could fit into the category &#x27;household goods&#x27;.
* how large the shipment is, in terms of both item size and quantity.
* how long the item for delivery will be in transit.
* &quot;Household goods (HHG)&quot; include furniture, art and similar items.
* &quot;Express:&quot; Very small business or personal items like envelopes are considered &quot;overnight express&quot; or &quot;express letter shipments&quot;. These shipments are rarely over a few kilograms or pounds and almost always travel in the carrier&#x27;s own packaging. Express shipments almost always travel some distance by air. An envelope may go coast to coast in the United States overnight or it may take several days, depending on the service options and prices chosen by the shipper.
* &quot;Parcel:&quot; Larger items like small boxes are considered &quot;parcels&quot; or &quot;ground shipments&quot;. These shipments are rarely over , with no single piece of the shipment weighing more than about . Parcel shipments are always boxed, sometimes in the shipper&#x27;s packaging and sometimes in carrier-provided packaging. Service levels are again variable but most ground shipments will move about per day. Depending on the package&#x27;s origin, it can travel from coast to coast in the United States in about four days. Parcel shipments rarely travel by air and typically move via road and rail. Parcels represent the majority of business-to-consumer (B2C) shipments.
* &quot;Freight:&quot; Beyond HHG, express, and parcel shipments, movements are termed &quot;freight shipments&quot;.

==Shipping costs==
An LTL shipper often realizes savings by utilizing a freight broker, online marketplace or another intermediary, instead of contracting directly with a trucking company. Brokers can shop the marketplace and obtain lower rates than most smaller shippers can obtain directly. In the LTL marketplace, intermediaries typically receive 50% to 80% discounts from published rates, whereas a small shipper may only be offered a 5% to 30% discount by the carrier. Intermediaries are licensed by the DOT and have the requirements to provide proof of insurance.

Truckload (TL) carriers usually charge a rate per kilometre or mile. The rate varies depending on the distance, geographic location of the delivery, items being shipped, equipment type required, and service times required. TL shipments usually receive a variety of surcharges very similar to those described for LTL shipments above. There are thousands more small carriers in the TL market than in the LTL market. Therefore, the use of transportation intermediaries or brokers is widespread.

Another cost-saving method is facilitating pickups or deliveries at the carrier&#x27;s terminals. Carriers or intermediaries can provide shippers with the address and phone number for the closest shipping terminal to the origin and/or destination. By doing this, shippers avoid any accessorial fees that might normally be charged for liftgate, residential pickup/delivery, inside pickup/delivery, or notifications/appointments.

Shipping experts optimize their service and costs by sampling rates from several carriers, brokers and online marketplaces. When obtaining rates from different providers, shippers may find a wide range in the pricing offered. If a shipper in the United States uses a broker, freight forwarder or another transportation intermediary, it is common for the shipper to receive a copy of the carrier&#x27;s Federal Operating Authority. Freight brokers and intermediaries are also required by Federal Law to be licensed by the Federal Highway Administration. Experienced shippers avoid unlicensed brokers and forwarders because if brokers are working outside the law by not having a Federal Operating License, the shipper has no protection in case of a problem. Also, shippers typically ask for a copy of the broker&#x27;s insurance certificate and any specific insurance that applies to the shipment.

Overall, shipping costs have fallen over the past decades. A further drop in shipping costs in the future might be realized through the application of improved 3D printing technologies. 

==Security concerns==

Governments are very concerned with cargo shipment, as it may bring security risks to a country. Therefore, many governments have enacted rules and regulations, administered by a customs agency, for the handling of cargo to minimize risks of terrorism and other crime. Governments are mainly concerned with cargo entering through a country&#x27;s borders.

The United States has been one of the leaders in securing cargo. They see cargo as a concern to national security. After the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the security of this magnitude of cargo has become highlighted on the over 6 million cargo containers that enter the United States ports each year. The latest US Government response to this threat is the CSI: Container Security Initiative. CSI is a program intended to help increase security for containerized cargo shipped to the United States from around the world. Europe is also focusing on this issue, with several EU-funded projects underway.

==Stabilization==

Many ways and materials are available to stabilize and secure cargo in various modes of transport. Conventional load securing methods and materials such as steel strapping and plastic/wood blocking and bracing have been used for decades and are still widely used. Present load-securing methods offer several other options, including polyester strapping and lashing, synthetic webbings and dunnage bags, also known as airbags or inflatable bags.

Practical advice on stabilization is given in the International Guidelines on Safe Load Securing for Road Transport.

<text>The family Proteidae is a group of aquatic salamanders found today in the Balkan Peninsula and North America. The range of the genus &quot;Necturus&quot; (commonly known as waterdogs or mudpuppies) runs from southern central Canada, through the midwestern United States, east to North Carolina and south to Georgia and Mississippi. The range of the olm, the only extant member of the genus &quot;Proteus&quot;, is limited to the Western Balkans. The fossil record of the family extends back to the Late Cretaceous, with &quot;Paranecturus&quot; being known from the Maastrichtian of North America, and &quot;Bishara&quot; from the Santonian-Campanian of Central Asia.

== Taxonomy ==
Proteidae, is divided into two extant genera, &quot;Necturus&quot; with five North American species, and &quot;Proteus&quot; with one extant European species, the olm. A number of extinct genera are known extending back to the end of the Late Cretaceous.

==Life history==
In contrast to many salamanders, proteids never lose their gills during maturation from larvae. This aspect of their physiology is known as pedomorphosis. Despite having lungs, which appear to provide little use in respiration, mudpuppies spend their entire lives underwater. The adult gills resemble fish gills in many ways, but differ from fish gills in that they are external and lack any form of operculum, or covering. The bright red exposed gills are often found closed against the body in cool, highly oxygenated water. In warmer, poorly oxygenated water, the gills expand to increase water circulation and provide greater surface area for oxygen intake. Necturus salamanders such as &quot;mudpuppies&quot; also absorb oxygen through their skin and by occasionally breathing air at the surface.

Other distinguishing features of proteid salamanders, as compared with other salamanders, are the absence of eyelids and a lack of maxillary bones in the upper jaw. They show a degree of parental care, tending to the eggs after attaching them to submerged stones and logs. Proteid salamanders range in size from to in length.

Members of the genus &quot;Necturus&quot;, commonly called &quot;mudpuppies&quot; or &quot;waterdogs&quot;, prefer shallow lakes and streams that have slow moving water and rocks to hide under, but have been found in up to 90 feet of water. Their name originates from the misconception that they make a dog-like barking sound. Diet consists of small fish and many invertebrates, including crayfish, snails, and worms. Mudpuppies mature at four to six years and can live to be more than twenty years old. Progenesis is common for mudpuppies, enabling them to reach sexual maturity in their larval stage.

Even though they eat fish eggs, negative effects on fish populations have not been documented. Fishermen have been known to catch mudpuppies, sometimes in large numbers, but most often when ice fishing. Necturus salamanders also commonly feed on mollusks, worms, insects and small fish.

To distinguish between a larval mudpuppy and other larval salamanders, note that larval mudpuppies have distinct longitudinal banding and four toes on their hind legs, the combination of which is not found in most larval salamanders within the same range. The main difference between a mudpuppy and a siren is that, whereas mudpuppies have both front and hind legs, a siren will only have one pair of very small, atrophied front legs.

<text>The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (, ), commonly known as the McCain–Feingold Act or BCRA ( ), is a United States federal law that amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which regulates the financing of political campaigns. Its chief sponsors were senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI). The law became effective on 6 November 2002, and the new legal limits became effective on January 1, 2003.

As noted in &quot;McConnell v. FEC&quot;, a United States Supreme Court ruling on BCRA, the Act was designed to address two issues:
* The increased role of soft money in campaign financing, by prohibiting national political party committees from raising or spending any funds not subject to federal limits, even for state and local races or issue discussion;
* The proliferation of issue advocacy ads, by defining broadcast ads that name a federal candidate within 30 days of a primary or caucus or 60 days of a general election as &quot;electioneering communications&quot;, and prohibiting any such ad paid for by a corporation (including non-profit issue organizations such as Right to Life or the Environmental Defense Fund) or paid for by an unincorporated entity using any corporate or union general treasury funds. The decision in &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; overturns this provision, but not the ban on foreign corporations or foreign nationals in decisions regarding political spending.

Although the legislation is known as &quot;McCain–Feingold&quot;, the Senate version is not the bill that became law. Instead, the companion legislation, H.R. 2356—introduced by Rep. Chris Shays (R-CT), is the version that became law. Shays–Meehan was originally introduced as H.R. 380.

== History of the bill ==
In the aftermath of Watergate, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which put new limits on contributions to campaigns. Four years later, the FEC ruled that donors could donate unlimited money to political parties (but not the candidates themselves) if the party used that money for &quot;party building activities&quot; such as voter registration drives, but not to directly support candidates. Both the Republican and Democratic parties nonetheless used this money to support their candidates, and money donated to parties became known as soft money. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush vetoed a bill passed by the Democratic Congress that would have, among other things, restricted the use of soft money. President Clinton pushed for a similar bill, but was unable to get both houses to agree on one bill.

In 1995, senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) jointly published an op-ed calling for campaign finance reform, and began working on their own bill. In 1998, the Senate voted on the bill, but the bill failed to meet the 60 vote threshold to defeat a filibuster. All 45 Senate Democrats and 6 Senate Republicans voted to invoke cloture, but the remaining 49 Republicans voted against invoking cloture. This effectively killed the bill for the remainder of the 105th Congress.

McCain&#x27;s 2000 campaign for president and a series of scandals (including the Enron scandal) brought the issue of campaign finance to the fore of public consciousness in 2001. McCain and Feingold pushed the bill in the Senate, while Chris Shays (R-CT) and Marty Meehan (D-MA) led the effort to pass the bill in the House. In just the second successful use of the discharge petition since the 1980s, a mixture of Democrats and Republicans defied Speaker Dennis Hastert and passed a campaign finance reform bill. The House approved the bill with a 240–189 vote, sending the bill to the Senate. The bill passed the Senate in a 60–40 vote, the bare minimum required to overcome the filibuster. Throughout the congressional battle on the bill, President Bush declined to take a strong position, but nonethless signed the bill into law in March 2002 after it cleared both houses of Congress.

== Legal disputes ==

Provisions of the legislation were challenged as unconstitutional by a group of plaintiffs led by then–Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell, a long-time opponent of the bill. President Bush signed the law despite &quot;reservations about the constitutionality of the broad ban on issue advertising.&quot; He appeared to expect that the Supreme Court would overturn some of its key provisions. But, in December 2003, the Supreme Court upheld most of the legislation in &quot;McConnell v. FEC.&quot;
Subsequently, political parties and &quot;watchdog&quot; organizations have filed complaints with the FEC concerning the raising and spending of soft money by so-called &quot;527 organizations&quot;—organizations claiming tax-exemption as &quot;political organizations&quot; under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code (), but not registering as &quot;political committees&quot; under the Federal Election Campaign Act, which uses a different legal definition. These organizations have been established on both sides of the political aisle, and have included high-profile organizations such as the Media Fund and the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. 527s are financed in large part by wealthy individuals, labor unions, and businesses. 527s pre-dated McCain–Feingold but grew in popularity after the law took effect. In May 2004, the FEC voted to not write new rules on the application of federal campaign finance laws to 527 organizations. Although the FEC did promulgate a new rule in the fall of 2004 requiring some 527s participating in federal campaigns to use at least 50% &quot;hard money&quot; (contributions regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act) to pay their expenses, the FEC did not change its regulations on when a 527 organization must register as a federal &quot;political committee&quot;-prompting Representatives Shays and Meehan to file a federal court lawsuit against the FEC for the Commission&#x27;s failure to adopt a 527 rule. In September, 2007, a Federal District Court ruled in favor of the FEC, against congressmen Shays and Meehan.

In December 2006 the FEC entered settlements with three 527 groups the commission found to have violated federal law by failing to register as &quot;political committees&quot; and abide by contribution limits, source prohibitions and disclosure requirements during the 2004 election cycle. Swift Boat Veterans for Truth was fined $299,500; the League of Conservation Voters was fined $180,000; MoveOn.org was fined $150,000. In February 2007, the 527 organization Progress for America Voter Fund was likewise fined $750,000 for its failure to abide by federal campaign finance laws during the 2004 election cycle.

In June 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court held, in &quot;FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.&quot;, that BCRA&#x27;s limitations on corporate and labor union funding of broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within 30 days of a primary or caucus or 60 days of a general election are unconstitutional as applied to ads susceptible of a reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate. Some election law experts believed that the new exception would render BCRA&#x27;s &quot;electioneering communication&quot; provisions meaningless, while others believed the new exception to be quite narrow.

In June 2008, the section of the act known as the &quot;millionaire&#x27;s amendment&quot; was overturned by the Supreme Court in &quot;Davis v. Federal Election Commission&quot;. This provision had attempted to &quot;equalize&quot; campaigns by providing that the legal limit on contributions would increase for a candidate who was substantially outspent by an opposing candidate using personal wealth. In 2008 one of the cosponsors of the legislation, Senator John McCain of Arizona, touted this piece of legislation and others that he sponsored in his bid for the presidency. Senator McCain consistently voiced concern over campaign practices and their funding. &quot;&#x27;Questions of honor are raised as much by appearances as by reality in politics, and because they incite public distrust, they need to be addressed no less directly than we would address evidence of expressly illegal corruption,&#x27; McCain wrote in his 2002 memoir &quot;Worth the Fighting For&quot;. &#x27;By the time I became a leading advocate of campaign finance reform, I had come to appreciate that the public&#x27;s suspicions were not always mistaken. Money does buy access in Washington, and access increases influence that often results in benefiting the few at the expense of the many.&#x27;&quot;

In March 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;, regarding whether or not a political documentary about Hillary Clinton could be considered a political ad that must be paid for with funds regulated under the Federal Election Campaign Act. In January 2010, the Supreme Court struck down sections of McCain–Feingold which limited activity of corporations, saying, &quot;If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.&quot; Specifically, &quot;Citizens United&quot; struck down campaign financing laws related to corporations and unions; law previously banned the broadcast, cable or satellite transmission of &quot;electioneering communications&quot; paid for by corporations in the 30 days before a presidential primary and in the 60 days before the general election. The minority argued that the court erred in allowing unlimited corporate spending, arguing that corporate spending posed a particular threat to democratic self-government.

President Barack Obama expressed his concern over the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision during his 2010 State of the Union Address, delivered January 27, saying, &quot;With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests—including foreign corporations—to spend without limit in our elections. I don&#x27;t think American elections should be bankrolled by America&#x27;s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I&#x27;d urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems.&quot; President Obama also called the decision, &quot;a major victory for big oil, Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans.&quot;

== Impact ==
BCRA decreased the role of soft money in political campaigns as the law places limits on the contributions by interest groups and national political parties. BCRA had a &quot;Stand by Your Ad&quot; Provision, which requires candidates in the United States for federal political office, as well as interest groups and political parties supporting or opposing a candidate, to include in political advertisements on television and radio &quot;a statement by the candidate that identifies the candidate and states that the candidate has approved the communication.&quot;

The impact of BCRA first started being felt nationally with the 2004 elections. One immediately recognizable result was that, as a result of the so-called stand by your ad provision, all campaign advertisements included a verbal statement to the effect of &quot;I&#x27;m [candidate&#x27;s name] and I approve this message.&quot;

<doc id="396566" wikidata="Q76797" url="?curid=396566" title="J. Hans D. Jensen">
<text>Johannes Hans Daniel Jensen (; 25 June 1907 – 11 February 1973) was a German nuclear physicist. During World War II, he worked on the German nuclear energy project, known as the Uranium Club, where he contributed to the separation of uranium isotopes. After the war, Jensen was a professor at the University of Heidelberg. He was a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the Institute for Advanced Study, University of California, Berkeley, Indiana University, and the California Institute of Technology.

Jensen shared half of the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physics with Maria Goeppert-Mayer for their proposal of the nuclear shell model.

==Education==
Jensen studied physics, mathematics, physical chemistry and philosophy at the &quot;Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg&quot; and University of Hamburg from 1926 to 1931, and received his doctorate at the latter in 1932 under Wilhelm Lenz. He completed his habilitation in 1936 at the University of Hamburg.

==Career==
In 1937 Jensen was Privatdozent (unpaid lecturer) at the University of Hamburg and began working with Paul Harteck, director of the university&#x27;s physical chemistry department and advisor to the &quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot; (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) on explosives. Harteck and his teaching assistant Wilhelm Groth made contact with the &quot;Reichskriegsministerium&quot; (RKM, Reich Ministry of War) on 24 April 1939 to tell them of potential military applications of nuclear chain reactions. Military control of the German nuclear energy project, also known as the &quot;Uranverein&quot; (Uranium Club), began on 1 September 1939, the day that Nazi Germany initiated World War II by invading Poland. Harteck, one of the principals in the &quot;Uranverein&quot;, brought Jensen into the project. Jensen&#x27;s main thrust was on double centrifuges for separation of uranium isotopes (see the section below citing internal reports of the &quot;Uranverein&quot;). Harteck and Jensen developed a double centrifuge based on a rocking process (&quot;Schaukelverfahren&quot;) to facilitate the separation effect.

In 1941 Jensen was named extraordinarius professor of theoretical physics at the &quot;Technische Hochschule Hannover&quot; (today, the Leibniz University Hannover), and in 1946 became an ordinarius professor there. In 1949 he was appointed ordinarius professor at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg; and, from 1969 on, was emeritus praecox. He was a guest professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1951), the Institute for Advanced Study (1952), University of California, Berkeley (1952), Indiana University (1953), California Institute of Technology (1953), University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (1956), and University of California, San Diego (1961).

In 1963 Jensen shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physics with Maria Goeppert-Mayer for their proposal of the nuclear shell model; the other half of the prize was awarded to Eugene Wigner for unrelated work in nuclear and particle physics.

Jensen died on 11 February, 1973 at Heidelberg aged 65.

==Party memberships==
Adolf Hitler took power on 30 January 1933. On 7 April of that year the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was enacted; this law, and its subsequent related ordinances, politicized the education system in Germany. Other factors enforcing the politicization of education were &quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot; (NSDAP, National Socialist German Workers Party) organizations in academia and the rise of the &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; movement, which was anti-Semitic and had a bias against theoretical physics, especially including quantum mechanics. The Party organizations were the &quot;Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund&quot; (NSDStB, National Socialist German Student League) founded in 1926, the &quot;Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund&quot; (NSLB, National Socialist Teachers League) founded in 1927, and the &quot;Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund&quot; (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League) founded in 1933. While membership in the NSDDB was not mandatory, it was tactically advantageous, if not unavoidable, as the district leaders had a decisive role in the acceptance of an &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot;, which was a prerequisite to attaining the rank of &quot;Privatdozent&quot; necessary to becoming a university lecturer.

While all German universities were politicized, not all were as strict in carrying out this end as was the University of Hamburg, where Jensen received his doctorate and &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot;. Upon his 1936 &quot;habilitation&quot; he had been a member of NSDDB for three years, the NSLB for two years, and a candidate for membership in NSDAP, which he received the next year. The university leader of NSLB had made it clear that active participation was expected from Jensen, and that is what they got.

After World War II the denazification process began. When Jensen faced the proceedings, he turned to Werner Heisenberg, a prominent member of the &quot;Uranverein&quot;, for a testament to his character – a document known as a &quot;Persilschein&quot; (whitewash certificate). Heisenberg was a particularly powerful writer of these documents; as he had never been a member of NSDAP, he had publicly clashed with NSDAP and the Schutzstaffel (SS), and was appointed by the British occupation authorities to the chair for theoretical physics and the directorship of the &quot;Max-Planck Institut für Physik&quot; then in Göttingen. Heisenberg wrote the document and convinced the authorities that Jensen had joined the Party organizations only to avoid unnecessary difficulties in academia.

==Honors==
Honors conferred upon Jensen include:
*1947 – Honorary professor at the University of Hamburg
*1963 – Nobel Prize in Physics
*1964 – Honorary doctorate from the &quot;Technische Universität Hannover&quot; (today, the Leibniz University Hannover)
*1969 – Honorary citizen of Fort Lauderdale, Florida

==Internal reports==
The following reports were published in &quot;Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte&quot; (&quot;Research Reports in Nuclear Physics&quot;), an internal publication of the German &quot;Uranverein&quot;. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971 the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.

<doc id="396568" wikidata="Q184566" url="?curid=396568" title="Charles H. Townes">
<text>Charles Hard Townes (July 28, 1915 – January 27, 2015) was an American physicist. Townes worked on the theory and application of the maser, for which he obtained the fundamental patent, and other work in quantum electronics associated with both maser and laser devices. He shared the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov. Townes was an adviser to the United States Government, meeting every US president from Harry S. Truman (1945) to Bill Clinton (1999).

He directed the US government&#x27;s Science and Technology Advisory Committee for the Apollo lunar landing program. After becoming a professor of the University of California, Berkeley in 1967, he began an astrophysical program that produced several important discoveries, for example, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

Townes was religious and believed that science and religion are converging to provide a greater understanding of the nature and purpose of the universe.

== Early life and education ==

Townes had German, Scottish, English, Welsh, Huguenot French, and Scotch Irish ancestry, Townes was born in Greenville, South Carolina, the son of Henry Keith Townes (1876–1958), an attorney, and Ellen Sumter Townes (; 1881–1980). His brother, Henry Keith Townes Jr., (January 20, 1913May 2, 1990), was a renowned entomologist who was a world authority on Ichneumon wasps. Charles earned his B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Modern Languages at Furman University, where he graduated in 1935. Townes completed work for the Master of Arts degree in physics at Duke University in 1937, and then began graduate school at the California Institute of Technology, from which he received a Ph.D. degree in 1939. During World War II, he worked on radar bombing systems at Bell Labs.

==Career and research==
In 1950, Townes was appointed professor at Columbia University. He served as executive director of the Columbia Radiation Laboratory from 1950 to 1952. He was Chairman of the Physics Department from 1952 to 1955.

In 1951, Townes conceived a new way to create intense, precise beams of coherent radiation, for which he invented the acronym &quot;maser&quot; (for Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). When the same principle was applied to higher frequencies, the term &quot;laser&quot; was used (the word &quot;light&quot; substituting for the word &quot;microwave&quot;).

During 1953, Townes, James P. Gordon, and Herbert J. Zeiger built the first ammonia maser at Columbia University. This device used stimulated emission in a stream of energized ammonia molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0 gigahertz.

From 1959 to 1961, he was on leave of absence from Columbia University to serve as vice president and director of research of the Institute for Defense Analyses in Washington, D.C., a nonprofit organization, which advised the U.S. government and was operated by eleven universities. Between 1961 and 1967, Townes served as both provost and professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, during 1967, he was appointed as a professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley, where he remained for almost 50 years; his status was as professor emeritus by the time of his death during 2015. Between 1966 and 1970, he was chairman of the NASA Science Advisory Committee for the Apollo lunar landing program.

For his creation of the maser, Townes along with Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov received the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics. Townes also developed the use of masers and lasers for astronomy, was part of a team that first discovered complex molecules in space, and determined the mass of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

During 2002–2003, Townes served as a Karl Schwarzschild Lecturer in Germany and the Birla Lecturer and Schroedinger Lecturer in India.

Townes is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

==Astrophysics==
===Galactic Center===

The Galactic Center of the Milky Way had long puzzled astronomers, and thick dust obscures the view of it in visible light. During the mid to late 1970s, Townes together with Eric Wollman, John Lacy, Thomas Geballe and Fred Baas studied Sagittarius A, the H II region at the Galactic Center, at infrared wavelengths. They observed ionized neon gas swirling around the center at such velocities that the mass at the very center must be approximately equal to that of 3 million suns. Such a large mass in such a small space implied that the central object (the radio source Sagittarius A*) contains a supermassive black hole. Sagittarius A* was one of the first black holes detected; subsequently its mass has been more accurately determined to be 4.3 million solar masses.

===Shapes and sizes of stars===

Townes&#x27;s last major technological creation was the Infrared Spatial Interferometer with Walt Fitelson, Ed Wishnow and others. The project combined three mobile infrared detectors aligned by lasers that study the same star. If each telescope is 10 meters from the other, it creates an impression of a 30-meter lens. Observations of Betelgeuse, a red giant in the shoulder of the constellation Orion, found that it is increasing and decreasing in size at the rate of 1% per year, 15% over 15 years. ISI produces extremely high angular and spatial resolution. The technology is also playing an important role in the search for extraterrestrial life in collaborations with Dan Werthimer of Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).

==Personal life and legacy==

Townes married Frances H. Brown, an activist for the homeless, during 1941. They lived in Berkeley, California and had four daughters, Linda Rosenwein, Ellen Anderson, Carla Kessler, and Holly Townes. Frances died in 2018 aged 101.

A religious man and a member of the United Church of Christ, Townes believed that &quot;science and religion [are] quite parallel, much more similar than most people think and that in the long run, they must converge&quot;. He wrote in a statement after winning the Templeton Prize during 2005: &quot;Science tries to understand what our universe is like and how it works, including us humans. Religion is aimed at understanding the purpose and meaning of our universe, including our own lives. If the universe has a purpose or meaning, this must be reflected in its structure and functioning, and hence in science.&quot;

===Science and religion===

Townes&#x27;s opinions concerning science and religion were expounded in his essays &quot;The Convergence of Science and Religion&quot;, &quot;Logic and Uncertainties in Science and Religion&quot;, and his book &quot;Making Waves&quot;. Townes felt that the beauty of nature is &quot;obviously God-made&quot; and that God created the universe for humans to emerge and flourish. He prayed every day and ultimately felt that religion is more important than science because it addresses the most important long-range question: the meaning and purpose of our lives. Townes&#x27;s belief in the convergence of science and religion is based on claimed similarities:
# Faith. Townes argued that the scientist has faith much like a religious person does, allowing him/her to work for years for an uncertain result.
# Revelation. Townes claimed that many important scientific discoveries, like his invention of the maser/laser, occurred as a &quot;flash&quot; much more akin to religious revelation than interpreting data.
# Proof. During this century the mathematician Godel discovered there can be no absolute proof in a scientific sense. Every proof requires a set of assumptions, and there is no way to check if those assumptions are self-consistent because other assumptions would be required.
# Uncertainty. Townes believed that we should be open-minded to a better understanding of science and religion in the future. This will require us to modify our theories, but not abandon them. For example, at the start of the 20th century physics was largely deterministic. But when scientists began studying the quantum mechanics they realized that indeterminism and chance play a role in our universe. Both classical physics and quantum mechanics are correct and work well within their own bailiwick, and continue to be taught to students. Similarly, Townes believes growth of religious understanding will modify, but not make us abandon, our classic religious beliefs.

=== Death ===
Townes had steadily been active at the UCB campus, visiting and working regularly in the physics department or at the Space Sciences Laboratory past his 99th birthday and only a few months before his death. Townes&#x27; health began to decline, and he died on route to the hospital in Oakland, California, on January 27, 2015, at the age of 99. &quot;He was one of the most important experimental physicists of the last century,&quot; Reinhard Genzel, a professor of physics at Berkeley, said of Townes. &quot;His strength was his curiosity and his unshakable optimism, based on his deep Christian spirituality.&quot;

<text>A television pilot (also known as a pilot or a pilot episode and sometimes marketed as a tele-movie) in United Kingdom and United States television, is a standalone episode of a television series that is used to sell a show to a television network or other distributor. A pilot is created to be a testing ground to gauge whether a series will be successful. It is, therefore, a test episode for the intended television series, an early step in the series development, much like pilot studies serve as precursors to the start of larger activity.

A successful pilot may be used as the series premiere, the first aired episode of a new show, but sometimes a series&#x27; pilot may be aired as a later episode or never aired at all. Some series are commissioned straight-to-series without a pilot (although an increasing number of such series have their first episodes titled &quot;Pilot&quot;). On some occasions, pilots that were not ordered to series may also be broadcast as a standalone television film or special.

A &quot;backdoor pilot&quot; is an episode of an existing series that heavily features supporting characters or guest stars in previously unseen roles. Its purpose is to introduce the characters to an audience before the creators decide on whether or not they intend to pursue a spin-off series with those characters.

Television networks use pilots to determine whether an entertaining concept can be successfully realized and whether the expense of additional episodes is justified. A pilot is best thought of as a prototype of the show that is to follow, because elements often change from pilot to series. &quot;Variety&quot; estimates that only a little over a quarter of all pilots made for American television proceed to the series stage.

==Pilot season==
Each summer, the major American broadcast television networks – including ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, PBS, Univision, and Telemundo – receive about 500 brief elevator pitches each for new shows from writers and producers. That fall, each network requests scripts for about 70 pitches and, the following January, orders about 20 pilot episodes. Actors come to Los Angeles from within the area or elsewhere in the United States and around the world to audition for them. By spring, actors are cast and production crews assembled to produce the pilots.

Casting is a lengthy and very competitive process. For the 1994 pilot of &quot;Friends&quot;, casting director Ellie Kanner reviewed more than 1,000 actors&#x27; head shots for each of the six main roles. She summoned 75 actors for each role to audition, and she then chose some to audition again for the show&#x27;s creators. Of this group, the creators chose some to audition again for Warner Bros. Television executives, who chose the final group of a few actors to audition for NBC executives; as they decide whether to purchase a pilot, network executives generally have ultimate authority over casting. Since the networks work on the same shared schedule, directors, actors and others must choose the best pilot to work for with the hopes that the network will choose it. If it is not chosen, they have wasted their time and money and may have missed out on better career opportunities.

Once they have been produced, the pilots are presented to studio and network executives, and in some cases to test audiences; at this point, each pilot receives various degrees of feedback and is gauged on its potential to advance from one pilot to a full-fledged series. Using this feedback, and factoring in the current status and future potential of their existing series, each network chooses about four to eight pilots for series status. The new series are then presented at the networks&#x27; annual upfronts in May, where they are added to network schedules for the following season (either for a fall or &quot;mid-season&quot; winter debut), and at the upfront presentation, the shows are shown to potential advertisers and the networks sell the majority of the advertising for their new pilots. The survival odds for these new series are low, as typically only one or two of them survive for more than one season.

==Types of pilots==
===Premise pilot===
A premise pilot introduces the characters and their world to the viewer; it is structured so that it can be run as the first episode of the series if substantial changes are not made between the pilot and greenlighting. In the event the changes being made are so substantial that they would cause confusion to viewers, the pilot (or portions of it) is often re-shot, recast, or rewritten to fit the rest of the series.

The pilot for &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, for instance, showed the castaways when they had just become stranded on the island. However, three roles were recast before going to series, with the characters either modified or completely altered to the point where the pilot could no longer be used as a regular episode. As a result, CBS aired &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s&quot; second produced episode, which opened with the same scene of the characters just stranded on the island (showing only those not re-cast), first; the story from the pilot from that point onward was largely reworked into a flashback episode which aired later (with several key scenes re-shot). Even &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s&quot; theme song, which was originally done as a calypso number, was rewritten and recomposed to be completely different.

Another example is &quot;Star Trek&quot;, where footage from the unaired original pilot, &quot;The Cage&quot;, was incorporated into the two-part episode, &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, with the story justification that it depicts events that happened several years earlier. Conversely, the second pilot for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, aired as the third episode of the show&#x27;s first season, even though it included some casting and costuming differences that set it apart from the preceding episodes.

If a network orders a two-hour pilot, it will usually broadcast it as a television film to recoup some of its costs even if the network chooses to not order the show. Sometimes, a made-for-TV-movie is filmed as a pilot, but because of actors not being available, the series intro is reshot for the first aired episode. The original &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; movie co-starred Loretta Swit (of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; fame) as Chris Cagney, but when she could not get out of her contract, they reshot it with Meg Foster, who after the first season was replaced with Sharon Gless; therefore, the original movie is not considered part of the television series, and is not included in the series collections on DVD. In some cases, this does not hamper broadcast, such as Jackie Cooper playing the role of Walter Carlson in the TV movie pilot of the 1975 series &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, but being replaced by Craig Stevens for the remainder of the series; the pilot is still considered part of the series and released to DVD as such. Likewise, &quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story&quot; had an almost entirely different cast from the series it was intended to pilot (&quot;The Waltons&quot;), but both have been rerun for many years.

===Proof of concept===
A proof of concept pilot usually takes place chronologically further into a series run than a premise pilot, to give network executives a better feel for how a typical episode would appear (since a premise pilot may have to deviate from a typical episode in order to properly introduce characters). &quot;Remington Steele&quot; used both a proof of concept and a premise pilot. Proofs of concept were particularly common for game shows; in such cases, the pilot may be entirely or partially scripted (and thus, due to regulations passed after the 1950s quiz show scandals, illegal to broadcast in many jurisdictions) and use fake contestants and &quot;returning champions&quot; to demonstrate those concepts. The adventure series &quot;Lassie&quot; had both a premise pilot, &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, designed specifically to air as the series&#x27; first episode, showing how Lassie&#x27;s series owner, Jeff Miller, came to acquire her; and a proof of concept pilot, &quot;The Well&quot;, showcased situations typical to the series, which aired well on into the first season of the series.

===Backdoor pilot===
A backdoor pilot is a film or miniseries that serves as a proof of concept for a full series, but may be broadcast on its own even if the full series is not picked up. The term may also be used for an episode of an existing television show that serves to introduce a potential or already planned spin-off. Such backdoor pilots commonly focus on an existing character or characters from the parent series who are to be given their own show.

For example, to introduce &quot;A Different World&quot;, built around &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; character Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet), the &quot;Cosby Show&quot; episode &quot;Hillman&quot; was devoted to the Huxtable family visiting Denise during her freshman year at Hillman College though no characters from the upcoming series were introduced. A 2018 episode of ABC&#x27;s 1980s-set sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, titled &quot;1990-Something&quot;, heavily featured teachers who were recurring characters on the series and served as the backdoor pilot to &quot;Schooled&quot;, which debuted in early 2019.

In other cases, an episode of the parent show may focus on one or more guest characters who have not previously appeared in the show. For example, the &quot;JAG&quot; season eight episodes &quot;Ice Queen&quot; and &quot;Meltdown&quot; introduced the characters for what would become &quot;NCIS&quot;, while the &quot;NCIS&quot; season six two-part episode &quot;Legend&quot; introduced the characters for what would become the &quot;NCIS&quot; spin-off series &quot;&quot;, and the NCIS season 11 two-part episode &quot;Crescent City&quot; introduced the characters for what would become &quot;&quot;. &quot;NCIS: Los Angeles&quot; itself also included a backdoor pilot for a potential further spin-off – &quot;NCIS: Red&quot; – but the series was not picked up.

Similarly, the backdoor pilot for the television sitcom &quot;Empty Nest&quot; was an episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, which relegated that show&#x27;s regular stars to supporting characters in an episode devoted to new characters who were introduced as their neighbors. Feedback on the episode resulted in &quot;Empty Nest&quot; being extensively reworked before its debut; while the concept and the &quot;living next to the Golden Girls&quot; setting was retained, the series ended up featuring different characters from those in the original &quot;Golden Girls&quot; episode.

A 1972 episode of &quot;All In The Family&quot;, &quot;Maude&quot;, centered on the Bunkers visiting their cousin Maude Findlay at Maude&#x27;s house in Tuckahoe. Norman Lear was so impressed he wanted to make Maude as a separate show. &quot;Maude&quot; would debut 5 months after the episode aired, in September of 1972.

A 2011 episode of the TV Land original sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; focused on the wedding of the character Elka (played by Betty White). Boyce Ballentine (Cedric the Entertainer), an R&amp;B singer-turned-preacher, was introduced as the pastor for the wedding, with the intention of Boyce eventually having his own series on the network. That came to fruition in 2012, when TV Land introduced &quot;The Soul Man&quot;.

A historically important venue for backdoor pilots has been the anthology series. They have variously been used as a place to show work still being actively considered for pickup, and as a venue for completed work already rejected by the network. With the decline of anthology series, backdoor pilots have increasingly been seen as episodes of existing series, one-off television films, and miniseries. As backdoor pilots have either failed to sell or are awaiting audience reception from its one-time broadcast, networks will not advertise them as pilots, only promoting them as a &quot;special&quot; or &quot;movie&quot;. It is thus often unclear to initial viewers of backdoor pilots that they are seeing a pilot of any kind, unless they have been privy to knowledgeable media coverage of the piece.

Not all backdoor pilots lead to a series. The &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;&quot; was a backdoor pilot for a spin-off of the same name, featuring a human named Gary Seven (played by Robert Lansing), taken from Earth&#x27;s far past and raised by aliens to be sent to watch over Earth in the 1960s; while the series was not picked up, its characters have appeared in numerous non-canon &quot;Trek&quot; productions set in the 20th century. The third season two-part episode &quot;Terra Firma&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; is generally regarded as a backdoor pilot for a series featuring the character Philippa Georgiou. The final two episodes of the CBS sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot; (1965–71) were both backdoor pilots. With CBS being pressured by advertisers to develop more urban-themed shows (ultimately at the expense of the network&#x27;s rural-themed programs), &quot;Green Acres&quot; creator Jay Sommers was given an opportunity to develop two series ideas, both of which were rejected.

ABC attempted to create a spin-off of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; in 1980 called &quot;Toni&#x27;s Boys&quot;. The backdoor pilot that aired near the end of season four was simply titled &quot;Toni&#x27;s Boys&quot; and guest starred Barbara Stanwyck as Antonia &quot;Toni&quot; Blake, a wealthy widow and friend of Charlie Townsend&#x27;s who ran a detective agency she inherited from her late husband. The agency was staffed by three handsome male detectives: Cotton Harper (Stephen Shortridge), Bob Sorensen (Bob Seagren), and Matt Parrish (Bruce Bauer). The three took direction from Toni and solved crimes in a manner similar to the Angels. The show was not picked up as a regular series for the following season.

The series finale of &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; in May 1984 served as a backdoor pilot to a spin-off featuring Pat Harrington Jr.&#x27;s character Dwayne Schneider in a new setting, but CBS ultimately passed on the potential series. Similarly, the 1988 two-part series finale of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (&quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; and &quot;The Beginning of the Beginning&quot;) also served as a backdoor pilot that focused on the decision Blair Warner (Lisa Whelchel) made in using her trust fund to purchase the financially troubled Eastland Academy. Blair became headmistress and opened enrollment to male students for the first time in Eastland history. Up-and-coming actors Juliette Lewis, Mayim Bialik, Seth Green, and Meredith Scott Lynn were featured as some of Eastland&#x27;s new students. NBC did not pick up the new series.

&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; aired two episodes, named &quot;Jude Emery&quot; and &quot;Mason Dixon&#x27;s Girls&quot;, which served as a backdoor pilot complete with the Dukes cast interacting with the new characters. Ultimately, CBS passed on the two series in favor of a series starring Hazzard County deputy Enos Strate.

A pair of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; episodes aired as backdoor pilots that would not be picked up. The first, &quot;Radio Free Trumaine&quot;, featured Keri Russell as a college student who winds up working at the campus radio station, with David Garrison set to reprise his role as Steve Rhoades. The other was &quot;Enemies&quot;, which was intended as an antithesis to &quot;Friends&quot; in the same way the flagship &quot;Married... with Children&quot; was for &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. The pilot featured a guest appearance by Alan Thicke.

In June 2010, Lifetime pursued a spinoff procedural drama of &quot;Army Wives&quot; featuring Brigid Brannagh&#x27;s character, police officer Pamela Moran. The fourth-season episode &quot;Murder in Charleston&quot; was intended to serve as a backdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off. The episode sees Moran teaming up with an Atlanta-based detective on a murder that is related to a case she has been working on for the past three years. At the end of the episode, the detective encourages Moran to take a detective&#x27;s exam, and to look for her if she is in Atlanta. In September 2010, however, Lifetime declined to pick up the project to series.

In 2013, The CW announced there was a spin-off of their genre hit &quot;Supernatural&quot; in the works. The 20th episode of season nine titled &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, served as a back-door pilot, revealed in January 2014 to have been titled &quot;&quot;. The series was set to explore the &quot;clashing hunter and monster cultures in Chicago&quot;. The show was not picked up by the CW for the 2014–2015 season due to dismal overall reception by viewers. The &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; episode &quot;Valley Girls&quot; was supposed to be a backdoor pilot for a prequel spin-off series starring Brittany Snow as a young Lily van der Woodsen, however the show was not picked up. &quot;The Farm&quot; was an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot; that was supposed to act as a backdoor pilot for a spin-off series starring Rainn Wilson and focusing on his character, Dwight Schrute. Upon review, the spin-off was not picked up by NBC and the original version was never aired; instead it was reworked with additional material shot later, as the original version contained &quot;certain aspects that were appropriate for a pilot of a new show&quot;.

The &quot;Arrow&quot; episode &quot;The Scientist&quot; served as a backdoor pilot for the spinoff series &quot;The Flash&quot;, introducing Barry Allen as a CSI searching for super-powered people in an attempt to find his mother&#x27;s murderer. This episode also created the Arrowverse, a shared universe of interconnected DC Comics superhero TV series. The &quot;Heroes Join Forces&quot; crossover was a two-part backdoor pilot for another spinoff series set in the Arrowverse called &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, featuring a team of heroes and villains originally introduced in &quot;Arrow&quot; and &quot;The Flas&quot;h. The penultimate episode of &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;Green Arrow &amp; The Canaries&quot; served as an unsuccessful backdoor pilot for a series of the same name. &quot;The 100&quot; episode &quot;Anaconda&quot; also served as an unsuccessful backdoor pilot for a prequel series.

===Put pilot===
A put pilot is a pilot that the network has agreed to broadcast either as a special or series; if it does not, it will have to pay substantial monetary penalties to the studio. This usually guarantees that the pilot will be picked up by the network.

===Unsold pilot===
An unsold pilot or &quot;busted pilot&quot; is a produced episode that is never broadcast or made into a television series. &quot;Variety&quot; estimates that only a little over a quarter of all pilots made for American television proceed to the series stage.

===Test run===
Instead of a single pilot episode, an alternative is a &quot;test run&quot;, a small number of episodes that air as a short-run series with the potential to go into full production if successful. This is particularly common among shows that are intended to be stripped (airing five days a week).

Talk shows occasionally use test runs. Metromedia and its successor Fox Corporation were particularly associated with using test runs for talk shows, with examples including &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;, &quot;The Huckabee Show&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;Huckabee&quot; that aired for six weeks in summer 2010), the final version of &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot;, and &quot;The Kilborn File&quot;, an unsuccessful comeback vehicle for Craig Kilborn.

In 2021, Fox Alternative Entertainment utilized a test market approach for its new reality talent competition format &quot;The Big Deal&quot;, producing a season of the series for Irish broadcaster Virgin Media One with the intent to use it as a pitch for Fox and other broadcasters.

====10/90====
In a 10/90 production model, a network broadcasts ten episodes of a new television program without ordering a pilot first. If the episodes achieve a predetermined ratings level, the network orders 90 more to bring the total to 100 episodes, immediately enough to rerun the show in syndication. Series that used the 10/90 model include Tyler Perry&#x27;s &quot;House of Payne&quot;, &quot;Meet the Browns&quot;, &quot;For Better or Worse&quot;, Debmar-Mercury&#x27;s &quot;Anger Management&quot;, and &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;. Byron Allen&#x27;s sitcoms followed a similar model, with &quot;Mr. Box Office&quot; and &quot;The First Family&quot; airing 26-episode first seasons with the intention of following them up with a full 104-episode order if successful; both series failed to reach the threshold Allen sought, though they remained in limited production (three to four new episodes a year, mixed in with the first season) for a few years afterward.

====Other examples====
An earlier variant was the 13-episode pilot run; in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Disney Channel notably gave a 13-episode pilot order to two series it never picked up, but would go on to longer runs on other networks: &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; (which also had a traditional pilot on NBC and would be revived by that network as &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;) and the Canadian drama &quot;Hillside&quot; (which would move to Nickelodeon, Disney Channel&#x27;s primary rival, and air as &quot;Fifteen&quot;).

==As distinguished from the series premiere==

A successful pilot is often used as the series premiere, the first aired episode of a new show, or it may be aired as a later episode or never aired at all. For the Canadian supernatural drama &quot;Lost Girl&quot;, the pilot that sold the series to Showcase, &quot;Vexed&quot;, was used as the eighth episode of the first series. In the case of &quot;Firefly&quot;, the original pilot (&quot;Serenity&quot;) which was intended to serve as the series premiere was rejected by the network, and a new first episode, &quot;Train Job&quot;, was shot specifically for broadcast.

Sometimes, too, viewers will assign the word &quot;pilot&quot; to a work that represented the first appearances of characters and situations later employed by a series – even if the work was not initially intended as a pilot for the series. A good example of this is &quot;Love and the Television Set&quot; (later retitled &quot;Love and the Happy Days&quot; for syndication), an episode of &quot;Love, American Style&quot; that featured a version of the Cunningham family. It was in fact a failed pilot for the proposed 1972 series &quot;New Family in Town&quot;, but was recycled as a successful pilot for 1974&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot;. So firmly embedded is the notion of it as a &quot;Happy Days&quot; pilot, that even series actress Erin Moran (who did not appear in the episode) viewed it as such, as well as its creator, Garry Marshall, since &quot;Happy Days&quot; itself did not have a separate pilot of its own. In a similar situation, the 1962 pilot &quot;Howie&quot; was resurrected 13 years later to form the basis of &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot;.

The original &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series had two pilots, neither of which became the premiere episode when the series was picked up. The first, titled &quot;The Cage,&quot; didn&#x27;t sell, but Desilu head Lucille Ball convinced NBC executives to allow shooting of a second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; which was accepted by the network. &quot;The Cage&quot; was edited and expanded into a two-part story, shown as &quot;The Menagerie.&quot; This turned out to be an auspicious decision, because of various challenges which bogged down series production during the first season. The second pilot was also shown during that first season, as the third episode. The only major character to appear in both pilots was Spock.

On other occasions, the pilot is never broadcast on television at all. Viewers of &quot;Temple Houston&quot;, for example, would likely have considered &quot;The Twisted Rope&quot; its pilot because &quot;The Man from Galveston&quot; was only publicly exhibited in cinemas four months later. Even then, &quot;The Man from Galveston&quot; had an almost entirely different cast, and its main character was renamed to avoid confusion with the then-ongoing series.

Some television series are commissioned &quot;straight-to-series&quot; where a network orders a season without viewing any produced episodes, hence no episode is considered a pilot. For instance, &quot;Invasion of the Bane&quot;, the first episode of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, is not a pilot because the BBC had committed to the first season before seeing any filmed content – yet it is routinely referred to as a pilot. The straight-to-series model is usually used when established talent is attached to a series, or it is based on an established property or franchise. &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (1985) is credited as being one of the first series commissioned without a pilot. The model has seen a rise since Netflix popularized it.

==Theatrical release==
A number of unsold pilots have been reworked into theatrically-released feature films, including &quot;Lum and Abner Abroad&quot; (1956), which wove together three pilot episodes for a 1956 series that would have starred the comedy duo of Lum and Abner; &quot;Agent for H.A.R.M.&quot; (1966); and &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001), which was composed of an unsold pilot episode appended with an ending shot specifically for the film. The 1966 film release, &quot;Tarzan and the Trappers&quot; was edited from the unbroadcast pilot of a proposed 1958 &quot;Tarzan&quot; series. 

In addition, a number of unsuccessful pilot episodes have been released as direct-to-video films, including &quot;Belle&#x27;s Magical World&quot; (1998), &quot;Cruel Intentions 2&quot; (2001) and &quot;&quot; (2003).

On a few occasions, pilots have been released as a theatrical films prior to the debuts of their respective series. Examples include &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, whose pilot was theatrically released during the summer of 1978, prior to its broadcast as the opening episodes of the TV series that fall, and 1979&#x27;s &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, released in early 1979, with the series launching in the fall. In both cases there are substantial differences between theatrical and televised version: both BSG and Buck Rogers&#x27; theatrical pilots had recurring characters (Baltar and Tiger Man, respectively) killed off, the BSG pilot was extended for television, and the televised version of the &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; pilot utilized a different opening credits sequence and featured a newly added epilogue scene intended to lead into the weekly series.

==Use in anthology series==

By the mid-1950s, the practice of television executives of ordering dozens of pilots for proposed television series each year — far more than their networks could possibly broadcast as series — had created a sizable body of unsold pilots that had never aired. By 1954, the American television industry had begun to consider the idea of packaging these unsold pilots in anthology series and airing them during the summer, providing television networks with a way of both providing fresh programming during the summer rerun season and recouping at least some of the expense of producing them.

On June 8, 1956, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) would begin airing a package of unsold pilots that summer under the title &quot;G.E. Summer Originals&quot;, adding that &quot;the problem of what to do with &#x27;pilot&#x27; or sample films of projected television series that previously have failed to sell has been solved.&quot; &quot;G.E. Summer Originals&quot; premiered on the evening of July 3, 1956, at exactly the same time as another anthology series of unsold pilots, &quot;Sneak Preview&quot; on NBC, and these thus became the first two series of unsold pilots to air in the United States.

A number of summer anthology series consisting entirely or partly of unsold pilots were broadcast in the United States between 1956 and 1989. These series were:

* &quot;G.E. Summer Originals&quot; (ABC, 1956)
* &quot;Sneak Preview&quot; (NBC, 1956)
* &quot;Colgate Theatre&quot; (NBC, 1958)
* &quot;Decision&quot; (NBC, 1958)
* &quot;New Comedy Showcase&quot; (CBS, 1960)
* &quot;The Comedy Spot&quot; (CBS, 1960 and 1962)
* &quot;Westinghouse Preview Theatre&quot; (CBS, 1961)
* &quot;Vacation Playhouse&quot; (CBS, 1963–1967)
* &quot;Summer Playhouse&quot; (CBS, 1964–1965)
* &quot;Preview Tonight&quot; (ABC, 1966)
* &quot;Summer Fun&quot; (ABC, 1966)
* &quot;Premiere&quot; (CBS, 1968)
* &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; (CBS, 1971)
* &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; (ABC, 1974)
* &quot;Comedy Theatre&quot; (NBC, 1976 and 1979)
* &quot;Comedy Time&quot; (NBC, 1977)
* &quot;Comedy Theater&quot; (NBC, 1981)
* &quot;CBS Summer Playhouse&quot; (CBS, 1987–1989)

By the mid-1980s, the rise of cable television outlets had led to an increase of original programming during the summer months and ABC, CBS, and NBC began to experience a decline in summer viewership; the launch of Fox as a fourth major network in 1987 only exacerbated the problem for the former &quot;Big Three&quot; networks. Although CBS viewed &quot;CBS Summer Playouse&quot; — broadcast during the summers of 1987, 1988, and 1989 — as original programming that addressed this issue, it was the last anthology series of unsold pilots. Unsold pilots aired as one-offs occasionally during the 1990s, but then the practice of broadcasting them ended almost entirely.

<doc id="396575" wikidata="Q4392123" url="?curid=396575" title="Fσ set">
<text>In mathematics, an Fσ set (said F-sigma set) is a countable union of closed sets. The notation originated in French with F for (&quot;French&quot;: closed) and σ for (&quot;French&quot;: sum, union).

The complement of an Fσ set is a Gδ set.

Fσ is the same as formula_1 in the Borel hierarchy.

== Examples ==

Each closed set is an Fσ set.

The set formula_2 of rationals is an Fσ set in formula_3. More generally, any countable set in a T1 space is an Fσ set, because every singleton formula_4 is closed.

The set formula_5 of irrationals is not an Fσ set.

In metrizable spaces, every open set is an Fσ set. 

The union of countably many Fσ sets is an Fσ set, and the intersection of finitely many Fσ sets is an Fσ set.

The set formula_6 of all points formula_7 in the Cartesian plane such that formula_8 is rational is an Fσ set because it can be expressed as the union of all the lines passing through the origin with rational slope:

:formula_9

where formula_2 is the set of rational numbers, which is a countable set.

<doc id="396576" wikidata="Q3326291" url="?curid=396576" title="Handlebar moustache">
<text>A handlebar moustache is a moustache with particularly lengthy and upwardly curved extremities. These moustache styles are named for their resemblance to the handlebars of a bicycle. It is also known as a spaghetti moustache, because of its stereotypical association with Italian men. The Handlebar Club humorously describes the style as &quot;a hirsute appendage of the upper lip and with graspable extremities&quot;.

==History==
Similar styles of moustache are quite ancient, appearing on statues and other depictions of Iron Age Celts. In the United States, handlebar moustaches were worn in the later part of the 19th century by Wild West figures like Wyatt Earp. In Europe, handlebar moustaches were often worn by soldiers during the 19th century until roughly the era of World War I.

English comedy actor Jimmy Edwards grew his trademark handlebar moustache in the late 1940s in order to disguise facial injuries sustained as a pilot in World War II.

In 1972, to win a $300 &quot;best facial hair&quot; prize offered by team owner Charlie O. Finley, Oakland A&#x27;s pitcher Rollie Fingers grew a handlebar moustache which he sported throughout his career.

More recently, the contemporary hipster subculture has embraced the handlebar moustache by mocking conventional ideals of fashion, and by combining a highly manicured handlebar moustache with the portrayal of an unkempt appearance or a haphazardly selected clothing ensemble.

===Famous handlebar moustaches===

====Company mascots====
*Julius Pringles
*Mr. Monopoly
*Mr. Boh
*Air India&#x27;s Maharaja mascot
*Terrible Herbst

==Styles==
This style is usually achieved by the use of moustache wax, although hair gel, a curling iron, or natural curling can suffice. Generally, the greater the curl of the extremities, the more dramatic the appearance achieved. When worn without wax or grooming, the moustache style may more closely resemble a walrus moustache.

<text>The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (, PDI-P) is a centre to centre-left secular-nationalist political party in Indonesia. Since 2014, it has been the ruling and largest party in the House of Representatives (DPR), having won 110 seats in the latest election. The party is led by Megawati Sukarnoputri, who served as the president of Indonesia from 2001 to 2004.

In 1996, Megawati was forced out of the leadership of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) by the New Order government under Suharto. After Suharto&#x27;s resignation and the lifting of restrictions on political parties, she founded the party. PDI-P won the 1999 legislative election, and Megawati assumed the presidency in July 2001, replacing Abdurrahman Wahid. Following the end of her term, PDI-P became the opposition during the Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) administration. Megawati ran with Prabowo Subianto in 2009, but they were defeated by SBY. In 2014, PDI-P nominated Joko Widodo (Jokowi) as its presidential candidate. The party returned to power following its victory in the legislative election, and Jokowi was elected president. PDI-P continued its success in 2019, and Jokowi was re-elected for his second term. In 2024, the party won the legislative election, but its presidential candidate, Ganjar Pranowo, lost to Prabowo. President Jokowi&#x27;s alleged support for Prabowo strained his relationship with PDI-P, leading to his formal ousting after the Constitutional Court (MK) rejected all claims.

It is a member of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats, the Network of Social Democracy in Asia, and the Progressive Alliance.

==History==
===Origins===

At the 1993 National Congress, Megawati Sukarnoputri was elected Chairperson of the Indonesian Democratic Party, one of the three political parties recognised by President Suharto&#x27;s &quot;New Order&quot; government. This result was not recognised by the government, which continued to push for Budi Harjono, its preferred candidate for the chairpersonship, to be elected. A Special Congress was held where the government expected to have Harjono elected, but Megawati once again emerged as elected leader. Her position was consolidated further when a PDI National Assembly ratified the results of the congress.

In June 1996, another National Congress was held in the city of Medan, to which Megawati was not invited; anti-Megawati members were in attendance. With the government&#x27;s backing, Suryadi, a former chairperson was re-elected as PDI&#x27;s Chairperson. Megawati refused to acknowledge the results of this congress and continued to see herself as the rightful leader of the PDI.

On the morning of 27 July 1996, Suryadi threatened to take back PDI&#x27;s headquarters in Jakarta. Suryadi&#x27;s supporters (reportedly with the Government&#x27;s backing) attacked the PDI Headquarters and faced resistance from Megawati supporters who had been stationed there since the National Congress in Medan. In the ensuing clash, Megawati&#x27;s supporters managed to hold on to the headquarters. A riot ensued – at that stage considered the worst that Jakarta had seen during the &quot;New Order&quot; – which was followed by a government crackdown. The government later blamed the riots on the Democratic People&#x27;s Party (PRD). Despite being overthrown as chairperson by Suryadi and the government, the event lifted Megawati&#x27;s profile immensely, providing both sympathy and national popularity.

The PDI was now divided into two factions, Megawati&#x27;s and Suryadi&#x27;s. The former had wanted to participate in the 1997 legislative elections, but the government only recognized the latter. In the elections, Megawati and her supporters threw their support behind the United Development Party and the PDI won only 3% of the vote. Following Suharto&#x27;s resignation and the lifting of the &quot;New Order&quot; limitations on national political parties, Megawati declared the formation of the PDI-P, adding the suffix &quot;perjuangan&quot; (&quot;struggle&quot;) to differentiate her faction of the party from the government-backed faction. She was elected chairperson of PDI-P and was nominated for the presidency in 1999. &quot;De facto&quot;, PDI-P became a transformation or re-establishment of PDI and not a split.

===1999–2004: Election victory, the Wahid–Megawati administrations, and splits===
PDI-P was by far the most popular political party coming into the 1999 legislative elections. With 33% of the votes, PDI-P emerged with the largest share. As the 1999 People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR) General Session loomed closer, it was expected that PDI-P would once again play the dominant role. Despite winning the legislative elections, PDI-P did not have absolute majority. Despite this, however, PDI-P never formed a coalition with any of the other political parties in the lead-up to the 1999 MPR General Session. The closest PDI-P had to a coalition was a loose alliance with Abdurrahman Wahid&#x27;s National Awakening Party (PKB). The presidency looked set to be contested by Megawati and the then incumbent B. J. Habibie of Golkar who was looking for a second term. However, MPR chairman Amien Rais had other ideas as he formed a coalition called the Central Axis which consisted of Muslim parties. Amien also announced that he would like to nominate Wahid as president. PKB, their alliance with PDI-P never cemented, now moved over to the Central Axis. Golkar then joined this coalition after Habibie&#x27;s accountability speech was rejected and he withdrew from the race. It came down to Megawati and Wahid. Wahid, with a powerful coalition backing him, was elected as Indonesia&#x27;s 4th president with 373 votes to Megawati&#x27;s 313. The PDI-P supporters were outraged. As the winners of the legislative elections, they also expected to win the presidential elections. PDI-P masses began rioting in cities such as Jakarta, Solo and Medan. The normally peaceful Bali was also involved in pro-Megawati protests. Wahid then realized that there was a need to recognize PDI-P&#x27;s status as the winners of the Legislative Elections. With that, he encouraged Megawati to run for the vice presidency. Megawati rejected this offer when she saw that she had to face opponents such as United Development Party&#x27;s (PPP) Hamzah Haz and Golkar&#x27;s Akbar Tanjung and Wiranto. After some politicking by Wahid, Akbar and Wiranto withdrew from the race. Wahid also ordered PKB to throw their weight behind Megawati. She was now confident and competed in the vice presidential elections, and was elected with 396 votes to Hamzah&#x27;s 284.

The First PDI-P Congress was held in Semarang, Central Java in April 2000, during which Megawati was re-elected as the chairperson of PDI-P for a second term. The congress was noted as one where she consolidated her position within PDI-P by taking harsh measures to remove potential rivals. During the election for the chairperson, two other candidates emerged, Eros Djarot and Dimyati Hartono. Both ran because they did not want Megawati to hold the PDI-P chairpersonship while concurrently being Vice President. For Eros, when finally received his nomination from the South Jakarta branch, membership problems arose and made his nomination void. He was then not allowed to go and participate in the congress. Disillusioned with what he perceived to be a cult of personality developing around Megawati, Eros left PDI-P and in July 2002, formed the Freedom Bull National Party. For Dimyati, although his candidacy was not opposed as harshly as Eros&#x27;, he was removed from his position as Head of PDI-P&#x27;s Central Branch. He kept his position as a People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) member but retired in February 2002. In April 2002, Dimyati formed the Our Homeland of Indonesia Party (PITA).

Although it had not supported Wahid for presidency, PDI-P members received ministerial positions in his cabinet because of Megawati&#x27;s position as vice president. As time went on, much like the Central Axis that had supported Wahid, PDI-P would grow disillusioned with him. In April 2000, Laksamana Sukardi, a PDI-P member who held position as Minister of Investments and State Owned Enterprises was sacked from his position. When PDI-P enquired as to why this was done, Wahid claimed it was because of corruption but never backed up his claim. The relationship improved somewhat when later in the year, when Wahid authorized Megawati to manage the day-to-day running of the government. However, she and PDI-P had slowly but surely started to distance themselves from Wahid and join forces with the Central Axis. Finally, in July 2001 at a Special Session of the MPR, Wahid was removed as president. Megawati was then elected as president to replace him with Hamzah as her vice president, becoming Indonesia&#x27;s first female president. They party, however, faced further splits after Megawati became president with more disillusioned members leaving the party. Two of them were Megawati&#x27;s own sisters. In May 2002, Sukmawati Sukarnoputri formed the Indonesian National Party Marhaenism (PNI-Marhaenisme). This was followed in November 2002, with Rachmawati Sukarnoputri declaring the formation of the Pioneers&#x27; Party (PP).

===2004–2014: Opposition to the Yudhoyono administration===
By 2004, the reformist sentiments that had led PDI-P to victory in the 1999 elections had died down. Many were disappointed with what the reform process had achieved thus far and were also disappointed with Megawati&#x27;s presidency. This was reflected in the 2004 legislative election, PDI-P obtained 18.5% of the total vote, down from the 33.7% it obtained in 1999. PDI-P nominated Megawati as its presidential candidate for the 2004 presidential election. Several running mates were considered, including Hamzah Haz (to renew the partnership), Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), and Jusuf Kalla. Megawati eventually selected Nahdatul Ulama chairman Hasyim Muzadi as her running mate. It was expected that she would appeal to nationalist sentiments while Hasyim would appeal to Islamist voters. In the first round of elections, the pairing came second to SBY/Kalla. To improve their chances in the run-off, the PDI-P formed a coalition with the PPP, Golkar, the Reform Star Party (PBR) and the Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) in August 2004. However, they were defeated in the run-off against SBY/Kalla. The National Coalition then turned their eyes on being the opposition in the DPR for the SBY/Kalla government. With Kalla&#x27;s election as chairman of Golkar, Golkar defected to the government&#x27;s side, leaving the PDI-P as the only major opposition party in the DPR.

On 28 March 2005, the second PDI-P Congress was held in Sanur, Bali where Megawati was re-elected to the chairpersonship for a third term. Her brother, Guruh Sukarnoputra, was chosen as head of the party&#x27;s Education and Culture department. This congress was noted for the formation of a faction called the Renewal of PDI-P Movement. It called for a renewal of the party leadership if it was to win the 2009 legislative elections. Although they attended the Congress, the members left once Megawati was re-elected. In December 2005, these same members would form the Democratic Renewal Party (PDP).

The party came third in the 2009 legislative election with 14% of the votes. It had 95 seats in the DPR. Megawati was chosen as the presidential candidate, this time with a coalition between the Great Indonesia Movement Party and PDI-P themselves, with Prabowo Subianto as her running mate. They lost to SBY, with Boediono as vice-president, who won 26.6% of the vote.

===2014–2023: Return to power, the Jokowi administration, and factional rivalry===
Initially there were wide speculations that Megawati will run again for the third time during the 2014 presidential election. However during 2012, PDI-P suffered a leadership dilemma as there were fears within the party that Megawati might not win even if strong internal party support can be clearly seen. In an internal party survey by Poltracking on December 2013, many respondents preferred Joko Widodo to run as the party&#x27;s nominee rather than Megawati while an external survey done by CSIS earlier at May shown Jokowi to be the frontrunner. Megawati would announce that she will not run for president in 2013, citing regeneration as her reasoning. Despite having an agreement with Gerindra that they will support Prabowo Subianto&#x27;s bid for president, PDI-P decided to nominate Jokowi as their candidate for president on March 14, 2014. PDI-P will later form a coalition with Hanura, NasDem, and PKB on 19 May 2014 to support Jokowi&#x27;s candidacy and announced Jusuf Kalla as his running mate. The pairing won with 53.15% of the vote, and PDI-P returned as the largest party in the DPR, winning nearly 19% of the vote.

Relations between the party and Jokowi however weren&#x27;t always smooth. PDI-P criticize Jokowi for policy weaknesses, and PDI-P legislator Effendi Simbolon called for his impeachment. On a party congress held on 9 April 2015, chairwoman Megawati referred Jokowi as a functionary, saying that as the nominee of PDI-P, Jokowi should carry out PDI-P&#x27;s policy line and he owed the party the presidency. Several months prior, Jokowi had &quot;offended&quot; Megawati after having a dispute over the nomination of Budi Gunawan, her former ajudant, as the Chief of the Indonesian National Police by supporting Badrodin Haiti after Budi Gunawan got implicated by a corruption case. Because of Jokowi&#x27;s decision to back Badrodin Haiti and later Tito Karnavian, he was jeered by party cadres.

In April 2019, incumbent president Joko Widodo was the party&#x27;s presidential candidate running for a second term, with Ma&#x27;ruf Amin as his running mate. Widodo won a second term with 55.50% of the vote. PDI-P remained the largest party in the DPR, winning 19.33% of the vote.

In preparation for the 2024 Indonesian general election, the party split over the choice of a presidential candidate. Younger party members opposed Puan Maharani, the preferred candidate of the older establishment, in favor of Ganjar Pranowo. Despite his popularity, Pranowo declared he wouldn&#x27;t run. On 9 October 2021, Bambang Wuryanto urged unity under the (Javanese for &quot;bull&quot;) command for Maharani supporters, labeling dissenters as (Javanese for &quot;wild boar&quot;). In response, young members launched the (&quot;Fighting Boars Front&quot;) campaign on 12 October 2021, criticizing Wuryanto and the Central Board. They adopted a flag with an inverted color scheme as a symbol of defiance. On 15 October 2021, the PDI-P Central Board sanctioned members from both sides for attempting to bypass the leadership&#x27;s decision-making process, emphasizing that only Megawati could decide the official presidential nominee and urging an end to the rivalry.

===2023–present: Ganjar&#x27;s nomination, worsening ties between PDI-P and Jokowi===
On 21 April 2023, Ganjar was officially nominated by PDI-P as its presidential candidate. On 22 October, Gibran Rakabuming Raka–an active member of the party and the son of Jokowi–was officially nominated by the Advanced Indonesia Coalition as the vice-presidential candidate for Prabowo Subianto, after a controversial decision by the Constitutional Court allowed him to run. PDI-P initially supported the ruling and Puan Maharani opened a possibility to have Gibran to run as Ganjar&#x27;s running mate but later regrets it after Prabowo nominated him as his running mate. In November, Gibran was expelled from the party. In the following months, some members and politicians from PDI-P began to attack Jokowi. During the party&#x27;s anniversary celebration held on 10 January 2024, Megawati indirectly criticized &quot;power hungry&quot; leaders. Observers believe that her statement is directed towards Jokowi, who was not invited to the event. She asserted that PDI-P had triumphed in the two preceding elections due to the people&#x27;s backing, rather than owing to Jokowi&#x27;s influence.

Jokowi&#x27;s alleged preference towards Prabowo Subianto over the party&#x27;s nominee Ganjar Pranowo had caused splits to occur within the party. Members such as Budiman Sudjatmiko, Bobby Nasution, Immanuel Ebenezer and Maruarar Sirait had left the party due to their support to Prabowo Subianto. Gibran&#x27;s vice candidacy to Prabowo also lead to realignment of voter demographics, especially in their own voting stronghold of Central Java, as both PDI-P and Gibran have the same voting base.

On 22 April 2024, in aftermath of Constitutional Court rejection over all claims and disputes related to the 2024 presidential election, PDI-P Central Board declared that both Jokowi and Gibran were no longer PDI-P member, thus confirming their separation from PDI-P. PDI-P on 7 May 2024 submitted a lawsuit against the General Elections Commission to the Jakarta Administrative Court in hopes to annul the election results and prevent Prabowo and Gibran to be sworn in as president and vice president by the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR). On 24 October 2024 prior to the inauguration, the Jakarta Administrative Court rejected PDI-P&#x27;s lawsuit, upholding Gibran&#x27;s candidacy and the election results while penalize PDI-P by paying legal fees.

On 28 May 2024, PDI-P held their 5th national meeting in Ancol, North Jakarta. The meeting declared that the 2024 general elections is by far the worst in Indonesia&#x27;s democratic history due to massive practice of money politics, lack of ethics, abuse of power from the government and alleged violation of neutrality from election officials. PDI-P invites constitutional law experts, civil society, press, academics, intellectuals and all pro-democracy elements to carry out an objective evaluation of the implementation of the 2024 elections and demand all sides of the political spectrum to maintaining and realizing the ideals of the Reformasi, especially the institutionalization of democracy with popular sovereignty; eradicating corruption, collusion and nepotism (KKN); strengthening the press and civil society; supremacy of law; institutionalization of political parties; fair election organizers, and placing the TNI and POLRI to be more professional; and have an equal position in accordance with the spirit and history of its formation; its duties, functions and authorities are in accordance with the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia. The meeting also recommended that Megawati Sukarnoputri to once again held chairpersonship from 2025 to 2030.

As the result of their conduct of not supporting the choice of the party in the 2024 presidential and local elections, PDI-P will formally fire 27 members from the party which may include former President Joko Widodo and sitting Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka on 17 December 2024. Party secretary general Hasto Kristiyanto said the move is to solidify the party and to remind PDI-P&#x27;s commitment to Indonesia&#x27;s democracy. On 17 December, PDI-P formally fired Jokowi from his membership and accusing him for electoral interference, abuse of power and calling him the &quot;source of moral decay&quot;. They also fired several members, including Gibran Rakabuming Raka, Bobby Nasution, Effendi Simbolon, and John Wempi Wetipo for picking a different side during the presidential and local elections.

==Political identities==
===Ideology===
The 2008 Law on Political Parties states that political parties are allowed to include specific characteristics that reflect their political aspirations, as long as they do not contradict Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. As per Article 5, Section 1 of its constitution and bylaws (AD/ART), PDI-P adheres to Pancasila. Megawati specifically clarified that the Pancasila referred to is the version of 1 June 1945. In September 2023, the party&#x27;s Secretary-General, Hasto Kristiyanto, claimed that PDI-P is a progressive &quot;leftist&quot; party, not a communist nor socialist party. Outsider views on the party&#x27;s political orientation vary. Academics and domestic observers classified PDI-P as a nationalist and secular party, while their international counterparts described it as a secular-nationalist, liberal-secularist, or populist party. In the party&#x27;s stronghold of Central Java, PDI-P has been described as a catch-all party. Its political leaning has been described as centrist, centre-left, left-wing, and even centre-right.

===Political positions===
PDI-P supports the separation of religion and the state. It rejects regional regulations (perda) based on religion (such as Sharia-based perda), except for the Aceh region. PDI-P endorses gender equality and women&#x27;s rights. It rejects a three-term extension for President Jokowi. The party also proclaims itself as the party of the &quot;ordinary people&quot;.

According to its website, the party aims to realize the aims contained in the preamble to the 1945 Constitution in the form of a just and prosperous society and to bring about an Indonesia that is socially just as well as politically sovereign and economically self-sufficient, and that is Indonesian in character and culture. At the party&#x27;s fourth congress in 2015, PDIP issued a seven-point statement entitled &quot;Realizing Great Indonesia, an Indonesia that is Truly Independent&quot;, in which it committed itself to oversee the program of the central government. The statement emphasizes the Trisakti path as essential for political sovereignty, economic self-reliance, and cultural identity. It aims to revive national dignity, collaboration, and social justice while solidifying itself as a political force and underlining its support for the poor and battling structural poverty.

The PDI-P parliamentary group in the DPR have expressed their opinions on a few issues:
===Electoral support===

The 2008 survey by Lingkaran Survei Indonesia (LSI Denny JA) highlights non-Muslims, secular Muslims, and low-income voters as the primary constituents of the PDI-P. It is notably popular among &quot;not at all religious&quot; Muslim voters, with 33% support in the 2009 legislative elections. In the 2009 presidential polls, 41% of non-religious Muslim voters favored Megawati, surpassing her overall 27% support. Regionally, the party boasts a predominantly strong support base in Central Java, often referred to as the PDI-P&#x27;s &quot;stronghold&quot; or &quot;kandang banteng&quot; ( bull pen), Pangi Chaniago of Voxpol Research Center described the party&#x27;s electorates in the region as &quot;ideological voters&quot;. Additionally, the party thrives in Bali, West and Central Kalimantan, North Sulawesi, as well as Bangka Belitung—areas marked by substantial religious minorities or syncretistic forms of Islam, while facing challenges in certain areas of Sumatra, particularly in Islam-leaning Aceh and West Sumatra. It has also been popular among Chinese Indonesians voters.

==Leadership structure==
The following is the composition of the PDI-P Central Board members for the 2019-2024 working period with 1 year extension until 2025, as inaugurated by Megawati on 5 July 2024:
== Wing organizations ==
PDI-P wing organizations include the following:
* &quot;Baitul Muslimin Indonesia&quot; (BAMUSI, Indonesian Muslim Abode)
* &quot;Banteng Muda Indonesia&quot; (BMI, Indonesian Young Bulls)
* &quot;Taruna Merah Putih&quot; (TMP, Red and White Cadets)
* &quot;Relawan Perjuangan Demokrasi&quot; (Repdem, Volunteers for Democratic Struggle)
* &quot;Komunitas Indonesia Tionghoa Perjuangan&quot; (KITA Perjuangan, Chinese Indonesian Community of Struggle)

<text>Alfred Kastler (; 3 May 1902 – 7 January 1984) was a German-born French physicist and Nobel laureate in Physics. He is known for the development of optical pumping.

==Biography==
Kastler was born in Guebwiller (Alsace, at the time part of the German Empire) and later attended the Lycée Bartholdi in Colmar, Alsace, and École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1921. After his studies, in 1926 he began teaching physics at the Lycée of Mulhouse, and then taught at the University of Bordeaux, where he was a university professor until 1941. Georges Bruhat asked him to come back to the École Normale Supérieure, where he finally obtained a chair in 1952.

Collaborating with Jean Brossel, he researched quantum mechanics, the interaction between light and atoms, and spectroscopy. Kastler, working on combination of optical resonance and magnetic resonance, developed the technique of &quot;optical pumping&quot;. Those works led to the completion of the theory of lasers and masers.

In 1962, he received the first C.E.K Mees Medal from the Optical Society of America, and he was elected an Honorary member of the Society. The following year, he was elected a Fellow. 

He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1966 &quot;for the discovery and development of optical methods for studying Hertzian resonances in atoms&quot;.

He was president of the board of the Institut d&#x27;optique théorique et appliquée and served as the first chairman of the non-governmental organization (NGO) Action Against Hunger.

Kastler also wrote poetry (in German). In 1971 he published &quot;Europe, ma patrie: Deutsche Lieder eines französischen Europäers&quot; (i.e. &quot;Europe, my fatherland: German songs of a French European&quot;).

In 1976, Kastler was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1978 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1979, Kastler was awarded the Wilhelm Exner Medal.

==Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel==

Professor Kastler spent most of his research career at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris where he started after the war a small research group on spectroscopy with his student, Jean Brossel.

Over the forty years that followed, this group trained many young physicists, including Nobel laureates Claude Cohen Tannoudji and Serge Haroche, and had a significant impact on the development of atomic physics in France. The Laboratoire de Spectroscopie hertzienne was renamed Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel in 1994. It has part of its laboratories in Université Pierre et Marie Curie but mainly at the École Normale Supérieure.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Death ==
Professor Kastler died on 7 January 1984, in Bandol, France.

<doc id="396593" wikidata="Q4200185" url="?curid=396593" title="Imbecile">
<text>The term imbecile was once used by psychiatrists to denote a category of people with moderate to severe intellectual disability, as well as a type of criminal. The word arises from the Latin word &quot;imbecillus&quot;, meaning weak, or weak-minded. It originally referred to people of the second order in a former and discarded classification of intellectual disability, with a mental age of three to seven years and an IQ of 25–50, above &quot;idiot&quot; (IQ below 25) and below &quot;moron&quot; (IQ of 51–70). In the obsolete medical classification (ICD-9, 1977), these people were said to have &quot;moderate mental retardation&quot; or &quot;moderate mental subnormality&quot; with IQ of 35–49, as they are usually capable of some degree of communication, guarding themselves against danger and performing simple mechanical tasks under supervision.

The meaning was further refined into mental and moral imbecility. The concepts of &quot;moral insanity&quot;, &quot;moral idiocy&quot;, and &quot;moral imbecility&quot; led to the emerging field of eugenic criminology, which held that crime can be reduced by preventing &quot;feeble-minded&quot; people from reproducing.

&quot;Imbecile&quot; as a concrete classification was popularized by psychologist Henry H. Goddard and was used in 1927 by United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in his ruling in the forced-sterilization case &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, 274 U.S. 200 (1927).

The concept is closely associated with psychology, psychiatry, criminology, and eugenics. However, the term &quot;imbecile&quot; quickly passed into vernacular usage as a derogatory term. It fell out of professional use in the 20th century in favor of &quot;mental retardation&quot;.

Phrases such as &quot;mental retardation&quot;, &quot;mentally retarded&quot;, and &quot;retarded&quot; are also subject to the euphemism treadmill: initially used in a medical manner, they gradually took on derogatory connotation. This had occurred with the earlier synonyms (for example, &quot;moron&quot;, &quot;imbecile&quot;, &quot;cretin&quot;, and &quot;idiot&quot;, formerly used as scientific terms in the early 20th century). Professionals searched for connotatively neutral replacements. In the United States, &quot;Rosa&#x27;s Law&quot; changed references in many federal statutes to &quot;mental retardation&quot; to refer instead to &quot;intellectual disability&quot;.

<doc id="396596" wikidata="Q5255884" url="?curid=396596" title="List of political parties in Indonesia">
<text>Since 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In the six legislative elections since the fall of the New Order regime, no political party has won an overall majority of seats, resulting in coalition governments.

Pursuant to the Indonesian political parties act, political parties&#x27; ideologies &quot;must not be against Pancasila&quot; and &quot;is an explanation of Pancasila&quot;.

==Overview==

The Indonesian political party system is regulated by Act No. 2 of 2008 on Political Parties. The law defines political party as &quot;a national organisation founded by like-minded Indonesian citizens with common goals to fulfill common interests and to defend the unity of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia as based on Pancasila and the 1945 State Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia&quot;.

Political parties must register themselves with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights to be recognised by the authority. The law dictates that political parties&#x27; registration criteria shall include a notarial act recognising the party establishment and party constitution; a document describing party symbols; address of party headquarters and prove of distribution of party local offices in provinces, and cities and regencies; and a prove of party bank account. The law also dictates minimum membership of new political parties on 50 persons, with the percentage of woman members and allocation of woman members to party offices are set on a minimum of 30%.

=== Electoral eligibility ===
The party must undergo another registration process in order to participate in national elections; the registration shall be submitted to the General Elections Commission (KPU). Several criteria are required by the KPU, namely related to the party&#x27;s presence in Indonesia&#x27;s regions:

Political parties who have had their registration declined by the electoral commission due to failure to satisfy administrative criteria or other reasons are able to appeal their rejection to the General Election Supervisory Agency (BAWASLU). Specifically for regional political parties in Aceh, the first requirement is waived, while the second and third requirements are set at two-thirds of the regencies/cities and districts.

===Party principles===

Indonesian political parties should recognise the superiority of Pancasila and the national constitution, but Indonesian law tolerates the practice of other ideologies not in violation of the Pancasila and the constitution. A 1966 Provisional People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly resolution still in force today, however, explicitly prohibits establishment of a communist party, and political parties are banned from adopting &quot;Communism/Marxism-Leninism&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;; explicitly defined in the resolution&#x27;s corresponding explanatory memorandum to include &quot;the struggle fundaments and tactics taught by ... Stalin, Mao Tse Tung &quot;et cetera&quot;&quot;) as the party ideology.

In essence, Indonesian political parties differs little on party policy and ideology. The only major difference between Indonesian parties is their position as to how major a role Islam, by far the nation&#x27;s majority religion, should play in public affairs. This tendency resulting in several Indonesian political parties to brand itself as the part of nationalist-religious broad coalition in order to attract potential voters from both Muslim or Islamist and secular nationalist groups. Thus, for instance, (1) the Democratic Party (&quot;Demokrat&quot;), Party of Functional Groups (Golkar) and Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) are identified as the secular, (2) the National Awakening Party (PKB) and National Mandate Party (PAN) as the Muslim, but not Islamist, and (3) the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and United Development Party (PPP) as the Islamist.

The language of the left–right political spectrum is seldom used in Indonesia, in contrast with other countries. This tendency arose as the result of the New Order regime under Suharto which was anathema to left-wing policies after the 1965–66 Indonesian mass killings of members and supporters of the Communist Party of Indonesia. The New Order regime further stigmatised left-wing ideals as those espoused only by communists, discouraging Indonesian political parties from identifying themselves as left-wing movements lest they lose potential voters and be accused as communist. This tendency has survived even after the 1998 Reforms, partly due to the new regime&#x27;s insistence on keeping anti-communist legislation in force. In addition, due to how widely presidents shared power, Indonesian party cartelization differs significantly from canonical electoral alliances in Europe.

===Funding===
Political parties which won seats in the national or regional parliaments are eligible for funding from the central or local governments, based on number of votes received in the relevant legislative elections. The funding amount is set for Rp 1,000 per vote received at the national level, Rp 1,200 at the provincial level, and Rp 1,500 at the city/regency level. Local government can opt to allocate more funding to political parties - Jakarta, for example, paid in 2021 Rp 5,000 per vote received. After the 2019 election, this amounted to Rp 126 billion (USD 8 million) from the central government on an annual basis. This payout only made up a small proportion of party revenues – the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, for example, raised just 1.5 percent of its reported revenue from government funding. Donations and fees from elected officials made up a larger proportion of income.

==Parties represented in legislatures==
===Parties represented in national and regional legislatures===

===Parties represented only in regional legislatures===
These parties participated in the 2024 elections but failed to attain a single seat in the national House of Representatives after winning less than the parliamentary threshold of 4% of the popular vote. Notable failures were of the United Development Party, which lost all its seats in the 2024 election after having been represented in DPR since 1977, and Hanura, which won DPR seats in 2009 and 2014 but lost them in 2019 and failed to recover their seats in 2024. 

Despite electoral failure in the DPR, these parties successfully gained seat in regional parliaments (DPRD). Although, these political parties, along with other extra-parliamentary parties, are sometimes referred as .

Aceh&#x27;s special autonomy statutes allowed formation of local political parties to compete only in the Aceh House of Representatives. Although the party number is serialised from the national list, Aceh local parties only appeared in ballot paper circulating in Aceh province.

==Extra-parliamentary parties==
These political parties have no representation in either national or regional parliaments.

The term &quot;partai gurem&quot; (minor party, literally &quot;tropical fowl mite party&quot; referring to the small size) is commonly used by Indonesian media to refer to these political parties. The term initially referred to political parties that won a very small number of parliamentary seat, but after the 2004 election, to political parties that have no chance of surpassing the parliamentary threshold (currently 4%) necessary to gain representation on the House of Representatives. These political parties are often perceived to be lacking in organisational structure, their leaders seemingly interested solely in attracting media attention.

These parties often have their attempts at registering for elections turned down by the KPU due to the parties&#x27; failure to satisfy registration criteria set by the commission, which includes completeness of party documents, a permanent physical party headquarters, minimum membership and minimum percentage of woman members. Parties that had their registration rejected often resort to appealing their rejection to the Bawaslu, with varied success.

== Political party coalitions == 
Outside of the Suharto period, no political parties controlled a majority of the Indonesian parliament, necessitating the formation of coalitions. Coalitions may also be required to nominate candidates to executive office elections (i.e. President, Governors, Regents, Mayors and their deputies), and political parties often form coalitions for regional elections with parties which are on opposing coalitions at the national level.
==Historical political parties==
===Pre-independence parties===

In the first decade of the 20th century as a natural outcome of the Dutch Ethical Policy, which emphasised the importance of looking after the welfare of the people of the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch were tolerant of the rise and development of Indonesian society. Through this, the Dutch allowed the creation of education societies and funded its creation. Dutch educated Intelligentsias&#x27; would establish schools and education across the Dutch East Indies. Whilst the policy attempted to raise awareness among the natives of the need to break free from the shackles of the feudal system and develop along Western lines and were concerned about the native population&#x27;s social and cultural conditions, it spearheaded the spread of Indonesian National Revivalism, allowing people to silently organize and articulate their objections to colonial rule. The Budi Utomo was considered the first nationalist society (not party yet) in the Dutch East Indies, initiated the Indonesian National Awakening. Among other political organizations were the Indo Europeesch Verbond (Indo-European Alliance) and Indonesia Arab Association. Over time organizations turned into political parties, such how Budi Utomo turned into Parindra and Sarekat Islam into Indonesian Islamic Union Party. The Indische Partij is considered the first Indonesian political party. Years of campaigning by various political organizations across the Dutch East Indies eventually compelled the Dutch Government to recognize the need for concessions. As a result, on 16 December 1916, Governor-General J.P. van Limburg Stirum, in collaboration with the Dutch Minister of Colonial Affairs, Thomas Bastiaan Pleyte, sanctioned the establishment of a legislative assembly designed to represent the people of the Dutch East Indies. This assembly was named the &quot;Volksraad&quot;.

The Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies began when the Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies through Tarakan, Kalimantan, on 8 March 1942. By the Japanese Government, parties that were based on Indonesian nationalism and wanted to fight for Indonesian Independence were dissolved and banned from political activities on 20 March 1942.

===Political parties participating in 1955 and 1971 elections===

The election in 1955 was the first national election held since the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, and saw over 37 million valid votes cast in over 93 thousand polling locations, with more than 30 parties participating. Due to the numerous political parties participating in the election, the result was inconclusive, with no party receiving a clear mandate. The legislature which was elected through the election would eventually be dissolved by President Sukarno in 1959, through Presidential Decree number 150. Later on, after the take over by the New Order regime, only 10 parties was allowed to participate in the 1971 legislative election.
===Political parties of the New Order===

==== Government parties ====

After his rise into power, President Suharto expressed his discontent regarding multiple political parties, arguing that the failure of Konstituante in 1955–1959 was caused by party deadlock — unacceptable in his regime. He proposed that existing political parties unite based on their ideological essence — either spiritual (religious) or materialist (secular nationalist) — in order to cripple the resulting umbrella parties with infighting. Political parties&#x27; reaction to Suharto&#x27;s propositions was generally positive, with Islamic parties claiming that party fusion was in line with their last National Islamic Congress resolution agreed in 1969. A political alliance dubbed the &quot;Democratic Development Group&quot; was formed by the PNI, the IPKI, Parkindo, the Murba Party, and the Catholic Party to compete in 1971 election.

After 1971 election, New Order regime reiterated its call for political parties to fuse, and a MPR ordinance regulating political parties grouping issued in 1973 further pressured political parties to merge. All Islamic political parties merged to form the United Development Party (PPP) on 5 January 1973, and the remaining nationalist and non-Islamic political parties united to form the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) on 10 January 1973. Golkar, officially a &quot;federation of public organisations&quot; but effectively a political party, remained dominant for the entirety of the New Order. From 1985, all political parties were required to declare national ideology Pancasila as their &quot;one and only ideological basis&quot;.

The parties participated for the last time in the 1997 election, and the three-party system survived until the collapse of the New Order in 1998 Reformasi. Ensuing political liberalisation allowed establishment of multitudes of new political parties, with the number of political parties participating in 1999 election jumping substantially to 48 parties.

==== Activist parties ====
Prior to the end of the New Order era, there was a time where several political activists and student movements established small political parties in the early 1990s. Sensing the near fall of the New Order, the formation of these newly unregistered and unrecognized political parties was based on opposition to the New Order government and positioned themselves as the opposition and played a crucial part in the fall of the new order. The new parties then and only participated in the 1999 elections. 

Whilst the New Masyumi Party predates the wave of the new opposition parties, the Indonesian Democratic Union Party (PUDI) was considered as the first genuine opposition party. As PUDI was upfront and outspoken in their political opposition as a party against the New Order regime, the first out of many. At one point, fielding both presidential and vice-presidential candidates, PUDI was considered a challenger to Suharto&#x27;s rule. Emboldened by the success of PUDI, the Democratic People&#x27;s Association (PRD) organisation declared itself the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (also abbreviated as PRD). On 22 July 1996, the PRD was officially declared to the public and announced its political manifesto.

===Political parties in Reform era (1998–2004)===
====Parties participating only in 1999 elections====
Following political liberalisation after the collapse of the New Order regime in 1998 Reformasi, registration for new political parties jumped significantly. As the result, the following 1999 election had 148 registered political parties and 48 of them competing for DPR seats, compared to the previous 1997 election that saw only 2 political parties plus Golkar.

After the Reform, the PPP survived and continues to participate in all following elections after 1999, albeit with much of its membership having broken off from it and founded their own parties. Golkar too was made a proper party and exists to this day. The PDI failed to imitate the post-Suharto successes of the PPP and Golkar after the government intervened and unseated Chairman Megawati Soekarnoputri, causing PDI support to collapse in the 1997 election. PDI votes further eroded as support instead went to its breakaway Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), led by Megawati in the post-Suharto 1999 election, resulting in the party winning only two seats in contrast to the PDI-P&#x27;s 153 seats. After poor electoral performance and failure to register for the 2004 election, PDI rebranded itself as the Indonesian Democratic Vanguard Party (PPDI) in 2003.

Several parties claimed inheritance from former political parties existing prior to the New Order era, resulting in parties sharing similar political party names, with faction names as the only characteristics that made those parties distinct from each other. Example on this case was on claimants to the heritage of the former Indonesian National Party (PNI), Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII), League of Supporters of Indonesian Independence (IPKI), Masyumi Party, and Murba Party.

Most of the parties failed to gain even a single seat due to lack of votes. After the new electoral law authorised the use of a parliamentary threshold to determine the division of DPR seats, those parties were forced to reorganise themselves in order to be able to register for the next 2004 election.

Below is the list of political parties participating only in the 1999 election which failed to participate in the next 2004 election.

==== Parties participating in 2004 and 2009 elections ====
After the 1999 legislative election, 150 parties were registered with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights. However, after a review by the newly formed General Election Commission, this number was reduced to 50, and then to 24. This decrease from the 48 parties that ran in the 1999 legislative election was primarily due to a new election law that allowed only parties that had won 2% of DPR seats or 3% of seats in provincial and regental legislatures in half of the provinces to run in the 2004 election. Only six parties met this criterion, and the others were forced to merge or reorganize into a new party.

In 2009, introduction of a parliamentary threshold also meant that only parties receiving more than 2.5% of the popular vote would be seated in the DPR. This threshold was raised to 3.5% in 2014, then finally to 4% in 2017 as a way to cut election costs and ensure stability. As a result small parties have no chance of surpassing the parliamentary threshold.

Below is the list of political parties participating in the 2004 and 2009 elections which failed to participate in the next 2014 election.

===Political parties in post-reform era (2005–present)===

<doc id="396605" wikidata="Q1412224" url="?curid=396605" title="Tribunal">
<text>A tribunal, generally, is any person or institution with authority to judge, adjudicate on, or determine claims or disputes—whether or not it is called a tribunal in its title. For example, an advocate who appears before a court with a single judge could describe that judge as &quot;their tribunal&quot;. Many governmental bodies are titled &quot;tribunals&quot; to emphasize that they are not courts of normal jurisdiction. For instance, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was a body specially constituted under international law; in Great Britain, employment tribunals are bodies set up to hear specific employment disputes.

In many but not all cases, &quot;tribunal&quot; implies a judicial or quasi-judicial body with a lesser degree of formality than a court, in which the normal rules of evidence and procedure may not apply, and whose presiding officers are frequently neither judges nor magistrates. Private judicial bodies are also often-styled tribunals. &quot;Tribunal&quot; is not conclusive of a body&#x27;s function; in Great Britain, the Employment Appeal Tribunal is a superior court of record.

The term is derived from the tribunes, magistrates of the Classical Roman Republic. &quot;Tribunal&quot; originally referred to the office of the tribunes, and the term is still sometimes used in this sense in historical writings. The tribunal was the platform upon which the presiding authority sat; having a raised position physically was symbolic of their higher position regarding the adjudication of the law.

==By country==
===Australia===
In Australia, &quot;tribunal&quot; generally implies a judicial body with a lesser degree of formality than a &quot;court&quot;, with a simplified legal procedure, often presided over by a lawyer (solicitor or barrister) who is not a judge or magistrate (often referred to as a &quot;member&quot; of the tribunal). In many cases, the lawyers who function as tribunal members do so only part-time and spend the greater part of their time carrying out other aspects of legal practice, such as representing clients. In many cases, the formal rules of evidence that apply in courts do not apply in tribunals, which enables tribunals to hear forms of evidence that courts may not be allowed to consider. Tribunals generally deal with simpler matters; while legal representation is permitted and not uncommon, self-representation is much more common in tribunals than in courts, and tribunal members and registry staff are generally more accustomed to dealing with self-represented parties than courts are. Appeal from a tribunal is to a court.

Tribunals in the Australian judicial system include the following:
*Administrative Appeals Tribunal (under review)
*New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal
*Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal
*State Administrative Tribunal of Western Australia
*Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal

Every state has a &quot;supertribunal&quot; that covers a wide range of administrative decisions and, in some cases, has civil jurisdiction. In several Australian states, tribunals function as the equivalent of a small claims court.

In the context of sport, &quot;tribunal&quot; frequently refers to the AFL Tribunal, the disciplinary body of the Australian Football League.

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, &quot;tribunal&quot; refers to a court that serves some special purpose, of which Bangladesh has several. These have been set up to ensure speedy trial and reduce case congestion in the normal courts. Besides this, Article 117 of the Constitution of Bangladesh empowers the parliament to set up one or more administrative tribunals. No court can entertain any proceeding or make any order regarding any matter within such tribunal&#x27;s jurisdiction.

=== Belgium ===
In the judicial system of Belgium, the names of the lower trial courts can be translated into English as &quot;tribunals&quot; (, , ). In comparison, the higher appellate courts can be translated as &quot;courts&quot; (, , ).

=== Brazil ===

The Judiciary of Brazil officially names &quot;tribunal&quot; the appeal court and the ones above it, always with more than one judge. The higher court is the Supremo Tribunal Federal (Supreme Federal Court), followed by the superior tribunals (Superior Tribunal de Justiça, Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, Tribunal Superior do Trabalho, Superior Tribunal Militar). The federal justice is divided into regions; each has its Tribunal Regional Federal (Regional Federal Court). Also, each state has its own Tribunal de Justiça (Justice Court).

===Canada===
*Civil Resolution Tribunal, an online Tribunal in British Columbia (BC).
*Landlord and Tenant Board, formerly the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal.
*Ontario Condominium Authority, facilitates dispute resolution between condo owners and boards regarding issues such as noise complaints.
=== Hong Kong ===
The following tribunals exist within the Judiciary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China: Lands, Small Claims, Labour, Obscene Articles. For public inquiries, commissions are set up instead under the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance.

===India===
There are tribunals for settling various administrative and tax-related disputes, including Central Administrative Tribunal, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, National Green Tribunal, Competition Appellate Tribunal and Securities Appellate Tribunal, among others.

The National Company Law Tribunal is a quasi-judicial body in India that adjudicates issues relating to Indian companies.

National Company Law Appellate Tribunal was constituted under Section 410 of the Companies Act, 2013, for hearing appeals against National Company Law Tribunal orders, effective 1 June 2016.

In several states, Food Safety Appellate Tribunals have been created to hear appeals against orders of adjudicating officers for food safety (additional deputy commissioners).

Armed Forces Tribunal is a military tribunal in India. It was established under the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007.

Permanent Lok Adalat (PUS) is a law court (also known as People&#x27;s Court) and special tribunal set up in some districts throughout the country. It has been established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.

===Ireland===

In the Republic of Ireland, &quot;tribunal&quot; popularly refers to a &quot;public inquiry&quot; established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. The main difference between a Parliamentary Inquiry (non-statutory) and a Tribunal of Inquiry in Ireland is that non-statutory inquiries are not vested with the powers, privileges, and rights of the High Court. Tribunals of Inquiry are. Tribunals are established by resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas to enquire into matters of &quot;urgent public importance&quot;. It is not a function of Tribunals to administer justice; their work is &quot;solely inquisitorial&quot;. Tribunals are obliged to &quot;report their findings to the Oireachtas&quot;. They can enforce the attendance and examination of witnesses and produce documents relevant to the work. Tribunals can consist of one or more people. A layperson or non-lawyer may be the Sole member of a tribunal.

===Netherlands===

Historically, before the separation of lawmaking, law enforcement, and justice duties in the Netherlands, all sentences were delivered by a tribunal of seven &quot;schepenen&quot;, or magistrates, appointed by the local count. Such a tribunal was called a &quot;Vierschaar&quot;, so named for a rope—or cord—drawn (&quot;schaar&quot; or &quot;scheren&quot;) in a four-square dimension, wherein the judges sat on four benches. These benches were also positioned in a square, with the defendant standing in the middle. Towns had the &quot;Vierschaar&quot; privilege to hear disputes. The &quot;Vierschaar&quot; was usually located in the town hall, and many historical town halls still have such a room, usually decorated with scenes from the Judgement of Solomon.

===United Kingdom===

The &quot;tribunal&quot; system of the United Kingdom is part of the national system of administrative justice. The system grew on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis from the beginning of the twentieth century, but reforms were introduced in 2007 to place most tribunals in a unified system with recognised judicial authority, routes of appeal and regulatory supervision.

===United States===
&quot;Tribunal&quot; is used in the U.S. generally to refer to courts or judicial bodies, as in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, for instance, define &quot;tribunal&quot; as &quot;a court, an arbitrator in a binding arbitration, or a legislative body, administrative agency, or other body acting in an adjudicative capacity.&quot;

==By sector==
===Catholic Church===

In the Catholic Church, ecclesiastical courts are called tribunals. Tribunals are distinguished by grade, while proceedings are distinguished by instance; for example, an archdiocesan tribunal may hear a cause in the first instance if the cause is first brought before the archdiocesan tribunal. Or, if the cause was first heard before the diocesan tribunal and is now appealed to the archdiocesan tribunal, the latter may hear the cause in the second instance. Only the Roman Rota can hear causes in the third instance, with limited exceptions. Other tribunals are incompetent in the third instance because of grade (&quot;ratione gradus&quot;) since they do not have the jurisdiction to judge in the third instance. Tribunals include:

*diocesan or eparchal tribunals (including archdiocesan or archeparchal tribunals)
*interdiocesan tribunals, that is, a tribunal erected by the Holy See for more than one diocese, either as a tribunal of the first instance or as an appellate tribunal in the second instance
*the synod of bishops of patriarchal churches is the highest tribunal within the territory of the patriarchal church, without prejudice to the primacy of the Apostolic See
*ordinary tribunal of the patriarchal church, distinct from the eparchial tribunal of the patriarchal church
*ordinary tribunals of the Apostolic See
**Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the highest tribunal in the canon law of the Catholic Church
**Tribunal of the Roman Rota, the highest appellate tribunal competent in most causes in the second and third instances and some causes in the first instance
**Apostolic Penitentiary, a tribunal for matters concerning the internal forum
**Supreme tribunal of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for certain more grave delicts (canonical crimes)

===In health sector===
Tribunals also play an integral role in health sectors within and across nations. They are often referred to as &quot;adjunctive tribunals&quot;. These quasi-judicial bodies possess regulatory, oversight, and dispute-resolution powers to aid health decision-making and governance. At the same time, the actual effects of adjunctive tribunals on health services are disputed, as little evidence exists to evaluate their efficacy. More empirical evaluations are needed to ensure that tribunals operate in a more evidence-based, systematic manner within the health sector.

<doc id="396607" wikidata="Q378913" url="?curid=396607" title="The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)">
<text>The Lord of the Rings is a 1978 animated epic fantasy film directed by Ralph Bakshi from a screenplay by Chris Conkling and Peter S. Beagle. It is based on the novel of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien, adapting from the volumes &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. Set in Middle-earth, the film follows a group of fantasy races—Hobbits, Men, an Elf, a Dwarf and a wizard—who form a fellowship to destroy a magical ring made by the Dark Lord Sauron, the main antagonist.

Bakshi encountered Tolkien&#x27;s writing early in his career. He had made several attempts to produce &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as an animated film before producer Saul Zaentz and distributor United Artists provided funding. The film is notable for its extensive use of rotoscoping, a technique in which scenes are first shot in live-action, then traced onto animation cels. It uses a hybrid of traditional cel animation and rotoscoped live-action footage.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was released in the United States on November 15, 1978, and in the United Kingdom on July 5, 1979. Although the film received mixed reviews from critics, and hostility from disappointed viewers who felt that it was incomplete, it was a financial success; there was no official sequel to cover the remainder of the story. However, the film has retained a cult following and was a major inspiration for New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson.

== Plot ==

Early in the Second Age of Middle-earth, Elven smiths forge nine Rings of Power for mortal Men, seven for the Dwarf-Lords, and three for the Elf-Kings. Soon after, the Dark Lord Sauron makes the One Ring, and uses it to attempt to conquer Middle-earth. After defeating Sauron, Prince Isildur takes the Ring, but after he is eventually killed by Orcs, the Ring lies at the bottom of the river Anduin for over 2,500 years. Over time, Sauron captures the Nine Rings and transforms their owners into the Ringwraiths. The One Ring is discovered by Déagol, whose kinsman, Sméagol, kills him and takes the Ring for himself. The Ring twists his body and mind, and he becomes the creature Gollum (Peter Woodthorpe) who takes it with him into the Misty Mountains. Hundreds of years later, Bilbo Baggins (Norman Bird) finds the Ring in Gollum&#x27;s cave and brings it back with him to the Shire.

Decades later, during Bilbo&#x27;s birthday celebration, the Wizard Gandalf (William Squire) tells him to leave the Ring for his nephew Frodo (Christopher Guard). Bilbo reluctantly agrees, and departs for Rivendell. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that evil forces have discovered that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets Frodo to explain the Ring&#x27;s history and the danger it poses, and Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He is accompanied by three Hobbits, his cousins, Pippin (Dominic Guard), Merry (Simon Chandler), and his gardener Sam (Michael Scholes). After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths, the hobbits eventually come to Bree, from which Aragorn (John Hurt) leads them to Rivendell. Frodo is stabbed atop Weathertop mountain by the chief of the Ringwraiths, and becomes sickened as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths catch up with them shortly after they meet the Elf Legolas (Anthony Daniels); and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the river.

At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by Elrond (André Morell). He meets Gandalf again, after the latter escapes the corrupt wizard Saruman (Fraser Kerr), who plans to ally with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. Frodo volunteers to go to Mordor, where the Ring can be destroyed. Thereafter Frodo sets off from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn; Boromir (Michael Graham Cox), son of the Steward of Gondor; Legolas; Gimli (David Buck) the Dwarf, along with Pippin, Merry, and Sam.

Their attempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, and they are forced into Moria. There, they are attacked by Orcs, and Gandalf falls into an while battling a Balrog. The remaining Fellowship continue through the Elf-haven Lothlórien, where they meet the Elf queen Galadriel (Annette Crosbie). Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, and Frodo decides to continue his quest alone; but Sam insists on accompanying him. Boromir is killed by Orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. Merry and Pippin are captured by the Orcs, who intend to take them to Isengard through the land of Rohan. The captured hobbits escape and flee into Fangorn Forest, where they meet Treebeard (John Westbrook). Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track Merry and Pippin into the forest, where they are reunited with Gandalf, who was reborn after destroying the Balrog.

The four then ride to Rohan&#x27;s capital, Edoras, where Gandalf persuades King Théoden (Philip Stone) that his people are in danger. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas then travel to Helm&#x27;s Deep. Frodo and Sam discover Gollum stalking them in an attempt to reclaim the Ring, and capture him; but spare his life in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum eventually begins plotting against them, and wonders if &quot;she&quot; might help. At Helm&#x27;s Deep, Théoden&#x27;s forces resist the Orcs sent by Saruman, until Gandalf arrives with the absent Riders of Rohan, destroying the Orc army.

==Production==

===Development===

Director Ralph Bakshi was introduced to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkien during the mid-1950s while working as an animator for Terrytoons. In 1957, the young animator started trying to convince people that the story could be told in animation.

In 1969, the rights were passed to United Artists, where an &quot;elegant&quot; Peter Shaffer script was abandoned. Film producer Denis O&#x27;Dell was interested in producing a film for the Beatles, and approached directors David Lean (busy with &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;), Stanley Kubrick (who deemed it &quot;unfilmable&quot;), and Michelangelo Antonioni. John Boorman was commissioned to write a script in late 1969, but it was deemed too expensive in 1970.

Bakshi approached United Artists when he learned (from a 1974 issue of &quot;Variety&quot;) that Boorman&#x27;s script was abandoned. Learning that Boorman intended to produce all three parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a single film, Bakshi commented, &quot;I thought that was madness, certainly a lack of character on Boorman&#x27;s part. Why would you want to tamper with anything Tolkien did?&quot; Bakshi began making a &quot;yearly trek&quot; to United Artists. Bakshi had since achieved box office success producing adult-oriented animated films such as &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; but his recent film, &quot;Coonskin&quot;, tanked, and he later clarified that he thought &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; could &quot;make some money&quot; so as to save his studio.

In 1975, Bakshi convinced United Artists executive Mike Medavoy to produce &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as two or three animated films, and a prequel to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Medavoy offered him Boorman&#x27;s script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman &quot;didn&#x27;t understand it&quot; and that his script would have made for a cheap film like &quot;a Roger Corman film&quot;. Medavoy accepted Bakshi&#x27;s proposal to &quot;do the books as close as we can, using Tolkien&#x27;s exact dialogue and scenes&quot;.

Although he was later keen to regroup with Boorman for his script (and his surrogate project, &quot;Excalibur&quot;), Bakshi claimed Medavoy did not want to produce his film at the time, but allowed him to shop it around if he could get another studio to pay for the expenses on Boorman&#x27;s script. Bakshi attempted unsuccessfully to persuade Peter Bogdanovich to take on the project, but managed to gain the support of the then President of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Dan Melnick. Bakshi and Melnick made a deal with Mike Medavoy at United Artists to buy the Boorman script. Bakshi said later that &quot;The Boorman script cost $3 million, so Boorman was happy by the pool, screaming and laughing and drinking, &#x27;cause he got $3 million for his script to be thrown out.&quot; Boorman, however, was unhappy with the project going to animation after Tolkien once wrote to him, pleased that he was doing it in live-action. He never saw Bakshi&#x27;s film, and after it was released, tried to remake his live-action version with Medavoy.

Work began on scripts and storyboards. When Melnick was fired from MGM in 1976, Bakshi&#x27;s studio had spent between $200,000 and $600,000. The new executive Dick Shepherd had not read the books and, according to Bakshi, did not want to make the movie; Shepherd obliviously asked whether &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was about a wedding. Bakshi then contacted Saul Zaentz (who had helped finance &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;), asking him to produce &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;; Zaentz agreed.

Before production started, Bakshi met with Tolkien&#x27;s daughter Priscilla to discuss how the film would be made. She showed him the room where her father did his writing and drawing. Bakshi says, &quot;My promise to Tolkien&#x27;s daughter was to be pure to the book. I wasn&#x27;t going to say, &#x27;Hey, throw out Gollum and change these two characters.&#x27; My job was to say, &#x27;This is what the genius said.&#x27;&quot;

Bakshi was approached by Mick Jagger, who wanted to play Frodo, but at the time the roles were already cast and recorded. David Carradine also approached Bakshi, offering to play Aragorn, and even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action; while Bakshi&#x27;s contract allowed this, he said it could not be done and that he had &quot;always seen it as animation&quot;. He said it was impossible to make it in live-action without it being &quot;tacky&quot;.

===Screenwriting===

Bakshi began developing the script himself. Learning of the project, Chris Conkling got an interview with Bakshi but was initially hired to &quot;do research, to say what the costumes should look like or what the characters would be doing at any given time&quot;. Together, they first decided how to break the films down. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but &quot;we didn&#x27;t know how that middle film would work&quot; without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing a treatment for one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on scripts for two 150-minute films, the first of which was titled &quot;The Lord of the Rings, Part One: The Fellowship&quot;.

The second draft of the screenplay, written by Conkling, told the bulk of the story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck&#x27;s point of view, so as to lead into the sequel. This version included Tom Bombadil, who rescues the Hobbits from the Barrow Downs, as well as Farmer Maggot, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. Bakshi felt it was &quot;a much too drastic departure from Tolkien&quot;. Conkling began writing a draft that was &quot;more straightforward and true to the source&quot;.

Still displeased, Bakshi and Zaentz called in fantasy author Peter S. Beagle for a rewrite. Beagle&#x27;s first draft eliminated the framing device and told the story beginning with Bilbo&#x27;s Farewell Party, climaxing with the Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep, and ending with the cliffhanger of Gollum leading Frodo and Sam to Shelob. The revised draft includes a brief prologue to reveal the history of the Ring. Fans threatened Bakshi that &quot;he&#x27;d better get it right&quot; and according to the artist Mike Ploog, Bakshi constantly revised the story to include certain beasts at the behest of such fans.

===Differences from the book===

Of the adaptation process, Bakshi stated that some elements of the story &quot;had to be left out but nothing in the story was really altered&quot;. The film greatly condenses Frodo&#x27;s journey from Bag End to Bree. Stop-overs at Farmer Maggot&#x27;s house, Frodo&#x27;s supposed home in Buckland, and the house of the mysterious Tom Bombadil deep in the Old Forest are omitted. Maggot and his family, Bombadil and his wife Goldberry and the encounter with the Barrow-wight are thus all omitted, along with Fatty Bolger, a hobbit who accompanied Frodo at the beginning. According to Bakshi, the character of Tom Bombadil was dropped because &quot;he didn&#x27;t move the story along&quot;.

===Directing===
Bakshi said that one of the problems with the production was that the film was an epic, because &quot;epics tend to drag. The biggest challenge was to be true to the book.&quot; When asked what he was trying to accomplish with the film, Bakshi stated &quot;The goal was to bring as much quality as possible to the work. I wanted real illustration as opposed to cartoons.&quot; Bakshi said that descriptions of the characters were not included because they are seen in the film. He stated that the key thing was not &quot;how a hobbit looks&quot;, since everyone has their own idea of such things, but that &quot;the energy of Tolkien survives&quot;. In his view what mattered was whether the quality of animation was enough to make the movie work.

Bakshi was aware of the work of illustrators like the Brothers Hildebrandt, without accepting that their style had driven his approach; he stated that the film presented a clash of many styles, as in his other films.

===Animation===

Publicity for the film announced that Bakshi had created &quot;the first movie painting&quot; by utilizing &quot;an entirely new technique in filmmaking&quot;. Much of the film used live-action footage which was then rotoscoped to produce an animated look. This saved production costs and gave the animated characters a more realistic look. In animation historian Jerry Beck&#x27;s &quot;The Animated Movie Guide&quot;, reviewer Marea Boylan writes that &quot;up to that point, animated films had not depicted extensive battle scenes with hundreds of characters. By using the rotoscope, Bakshi could trace highly complex scenes from live-action footage and transform them into animation, thereby taking advantage of the complexity live-action film could capture without incurring the exorbitant costs of producing a live-action film.&quot; Bakshi rejected the Disney approach which he thought &quot;cartoony&quot;, arguing that his approach, while not traditional for rotoscoping, created a feeling of realism involving up to a thousand characters in a scene.

Bakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including Christopher Guard, William Squire, Michael Scholes, Anthony Daniels, and John Hurt. Daniels remembers that &quot;The whole cast were in the same studio but we all had to leave a two second gap between the lines which made for rather stilted dialogue.&quot;&quot;&quot; For the live-action portion of the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the rotoscope models acted out their parts in costume in the open or in empty soundstages. Additional photography took place in Death Valley. Bakshi was so terrified of the horses used in the shoot that he directed those scenes from inside the caravan.

Bakshi had a difficult working relationship with producer Saul Zaentz. When Zaentz would bring potential investors to Bakshi&#x27;s studio, he would always show them the same sequence, of Frodo falling off of his horse at the Ford (which was his stunt double actually falling over).

During the middle of a large shoot, union bosses called for a lunch break, and Bakshi secretly shot footage of actors in Orc costumes moving toward the craft service table, and used the footage in the film. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by Billy Barty, while Sharon Baird served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins. Other performers used on the rotoscoping session included John A. Neris as Gandalf, Walt Robles as Aragorn, Felix Silla as Gollum, Jeri Lea Ray as Galadriel, and Aesop Aquarian as Gimli. Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film, very little of it appears in the final film. Most of the film&#x27;s crowd and battle scenes use a different technique, in which live-action footage is solarized (per an interview with the film&#x27;s cinematographer, Timothy Galfas, in the documentary &quot;Forging Through the Darkness: the Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings&quot;) to produce a more three-dimensional look. In a few shots the two techniques are combined.

Bakshi claimed he &quot;didn&#x27;t start thinking about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start to work so well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved back and forth on the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don&#x27;t think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy&#x27;s nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly.&quot; After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi&#x27;s first assistant director that &quot;if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again.&quot;

Following the live-action shoot, each frame of the live footage was printed out, and placed behind an animation cel. The details of each frame were copied and painted onto the cel. Both the live-action and animated sequences were storyboarded. Of the production, Bakshi is quoted as saying,

Although he continued to use rotoscoping in &quot;American Pop&quot;, &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, Bakshi later regretted his use of the technique, stating that he felt that it was a mistake to trace the source footage rather than using it as a guide.

By the time Bakshi was done animating, he had only four weeks left to cut the film from a nearly 150-minute rough cut. Restoring a piece of animation where Gandalf fights the Balrog (replaced in the finished film by a photomontage), Eddie Bakshi remarked that little of the film was left on the cutting room floor. Bakshi asked three additional months to edit the film, but was declined. After test-screenings, it was decided to re-cut the end of the picture so that Gollum would resolve leading Frodo and Sam to Shelob before cutting back to Helm&#x27;s Deep, so as to not end the film on a cliffhanger.

Working on the film were Tim Burton, Disney animator Dale Baer, and Mike Ploog, who worked also on other Bakshi animations such as &quot;Wizards&quot;.

===Music===
The film score was composed by Leonard Rosenman. Bakshi wanted to include music by Led Zeppelin but producer Saul Zaentz insisted upon an orchestral score because he would not be able to release the band&#x27;s music on his Fantasy Records label. Rosenman wanted a large score, involving a 100-piece orchestra, 100-piece mixed choir and 100-piece boy choir, but ended up with a smaller ensemble. Bakshi initially called his score &quot;majestic&quot;, but later stated that he hated Rosenman&#x27;s score, which he found to be too cliché.

In &quot;Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context&quot;, Ernest Mathijs writes that Rosenman&#x27;s score &quot;is a middle ground between his more sonorous but dissonant earlier scores and his more traditional (and less challenging) sounding music [...] In the final analysis, Rosenman&#x27;s score has little that marks it out as distinctively about Middle Earth, relying on traditions of music (including film music) more than any specific attempt to paint a musical picture of the different lands and peoples of Tolkien&#x27;s imagination.&quot; The film&#x27;s score was issued as a double-LP soundtrack album in 1978. The album reached number 33 in the Canadian RPM Magazine album charts on February 24, 1979.

==Reception==

===Box office, awards and nominations===

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was a financial success. Reports of the budget vary from $4 to $8 million, and as high as $12 million, while the film grossed $30.5 million at the North American box office. It thus made a profit, having kept its costs low. In the United Kingdom, the film grossed over $3.2 million. Despite this, the reaction from fans was hostile; Jerry Beck writes that they &quot;intensely dislike[d]&quot; the film&#x27;s &quot;cheap-looking effects and the missing ending&quot;, having been misled by the title to expect the film to cover the whole of the book.

The film was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. It was nominated for a Saturn Awards for Best Fantasy Film. Leonard Rosenman&#x27;s score was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Motion Picture Score, and Bakshi won a Golden Gryphon award for the film at the Giffoni Film Festival.

===Critical response===

Critics gave mixed responses to the film, but generally considered it to be a &quot;flawed but inspired interpretation&quot;. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s valiant attempt at rendering Tolkien&#x27;s magnum opus in rotoscope never lives up to the grandeur of its source material, with a compressed running time that flattens the sweeping story and experimental animation that is more bizarre than magical.&quot;

Frank Barrow of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;daring and unusual in concept&quot;. Joseph Gelmis of &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that &quot;the film&#x27;s principal reward is a visual experience unlike anything that other animated features are doing at the moment.&quot; Roger Ebert called Bakshi&#x27;s effort a &quot;mixed blessing&quot; and &quot;an entirely respectable, occasionally impressive job ... [which] still falls far short of the charm and sweep of the original story.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;both numbing and impressive&quot;.

David Denby of &quot;New York&quot; magazine felt that the film would not make sense to viewers who had not previously read the book. Denby wrote that the film was too dark and lacked humour, concluding that &quot;The lurid, meaningless violence of this movie left me exhausted and sickened by the end.&quot; Michael Barrier, an animation historian, described &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; as one of two films that demonstrated &quot;that Bakshi was utterly lacking in the artistic self-discipline that might have permitted him to outgrow his limitations.&quot;

Barry Langford, writing in the &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, noted the film&#x27;s deficiencies, including the &quot;glaringly evident&quot; weaknesses in the rotoscoping animation. The quality of rotoscoping from filmed live action is limited by the quality of the acting, which, given the lack of rehearsal and time for retakes, was not high. The prologue was not rotoscoped, but shot as &quot;silhouetted dumb show through red filters&quot;, revealing clumsy mime and confused voiceover, announcing that Mordor defeated Elves and Men at the Battle of Dagorlad, which Langford observes would make the rest of the action incomprehensible. The small budget led to underwhelming battle scenes, as in the Mines of Moria where the Fellowship is confronted by what looks like a very small force of Orcs. The rotoscoping varies from strongly drawn to almost absent, leading to a markedly uneven treatment through the film. The characterisation, in Langford&#x27;s view, similarly leaves much to be desired.

===Influence on Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

The film has been cited as an influence on director Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, although Jackson said that &quot;our film is stylistically very different and the design is different.&quot; Reading about attempts to make the films live-action by Boorman and the Beatles contacting Kubrick and Lean to do the same, Jackson agreed animation was the most sensible choice at the time. Jackson remembers Bakshi&#x27;s film as a &quot;brave and ambitious attempt&quot;. In another interview, Jackson stated that it had &quot;some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes&quot; but &quot;about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed&quot; and it became &quot;confusing&quot; and &quot;incoherent&quot;. He and his screenwriter and producer Fran Walsh remarked that Bakshi&#x27;s Treebeard &quot;looked like a talking carrot&quot;. Jackson watched the film for the first time since its premiere in 1997, when Harvey Weinstein screened it to begin the story conferences.

Ahead of the films&#x27; release, Bakshi said he did not &quot;understand it&quot; but that he does &quot;wish it to be a good movie&quot;. He felt bad that he wasn&#x27;t contacted by Zaentz, who was involved in the project, and erroneously said they were screening his film at New Line while working on the live-action films. Nevertheless, he clarified he wished the filmmakers success. He claims Warner Brothers approached him with a proposal to make part two at the time, but he complained that they didn&#x27;t involve him in the live-action film, and refused.

After the films were released Bakshi said that while, &quot;on the creative side&quot;, he does &quot;feel good that Peter Jackson continued,&quot; he begrudged Saul Zaentz for not notifying him of the live-action films. He said that, with his own film already made, Jackson could study it: &quot;I&#x27;m glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there&#x27;s a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget.&quot;

Bakshi had never watched the films, but saw trailers and while he praised the special effects, he said that Jackson &quot;didn&#x27;t understand&quot; Tolkien and created &quot;special effects garbage&quot; to sell toys, saying his film has &quot;more heart&quot; and that, had he a similar budget, would have made a better film. Bakshi was told the live-action film was derivative of his own, and blamed Jackson for not acknowledging this influence: &quot;Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened after I was bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that he said at the beginning that he never saw the movie. I thought that was kind of fucked up.&quot; Jackson, who took a fan photograph with Bakshi in 1993, remains puzzled about Bakshi&#x27;s indignation. In 2015, Bakshi apologized for some of his remarks. Bakshi&#x27;s animator Mike Ploog praised the live-action film.

In fact, Jackson did acknowledge Bakshi&#x27;s film as early as 1998, when he told a worried fan that he hoped to outdo Bakshi, as well as mentioning in the behind-the-scenes features that &quot;the black Riders galloping out of Bree was an image I remember very clearly [...] from the Ralph Bakshi film.&quot; In the audio commentary to &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Jackson says Bakshi&#x27;s film introduced him to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;inspired me to read the book&quot; and in a 2001 interview, said he &quot;enjoyed [the film] and wanted to know more&quot;. On the audio commentary for the DVD release of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo&#x27;s birthday party shouting &quot;Proudfeet!&quot;, as an intentional homage to Bakshi&#x27;s film, which Jackson thought was &quot;a brilliant angle&quot;.

Another influence came through one of Jackson&#x27;s conceptual artists, John Howe, who unwittingly copied a scene from Bakshi&#x27;s film in a painting that depicted the four Hobbits hiding under a branch from a Ringwraith. The painting was used in the 1987 J. R. R. Tolkien Calendar. Jackson turned the painting into a scene in the film.

==Canceled sequels==

The film was originally intended to be distributed as &quot;The Lord of the Rings Part I&quot;. Initially a trilogy was planned, but this was revised to two planned films because of the limited budget. Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck. According to Bakshi, when he completed the film, United Artists executives told him that they were planning to release the film without indicating that a sequel would follow, because they felt that audiences would not pay to see half of a film. Bakshi stated that he strongly opposed this, and agreed with the shocked viewers who complained that the film was unfinished. In his view, &quot;Had it said &#x27;Part One,&#x27; I think everyone would have respected it.&quot;

Although UA found that the film, while financially successful, &quot;failed to overwhelm audiences&quot;, Bakshi began working on a sequel, and even had some B-roll footage shot. &quot;The Film Book of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s the Lord of the Rings&quot;, published by Ballantine Books on October 12, 1978, still referred to the sequel in the book&#x27;s inside cover jacket. Indeed, in interviews Bakshi talked about doing &quot;a part two film picking up where this leaves off&quot;, and even boasted that the second film could &quot;pick up on sequences that we missed in the first book&quot;. Zaentz went so far as to try to stop the Rankin/Bass&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the King&quot; TV special (which was already storyboarded before Bakshi&#x27;s film came out) from airing, so as to not clash with Bakshi&#x27;s sequel.

Bakshi was aware of Rankin/Bass&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; TV special, and angrily commented that &quot;&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is not going to have any song for the sake of a record album.&quot; During the lawsuit, he commented that &quot;They&#x27;re not going to stop us from doing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and they won&#x27;t stop us from doing &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; Anyone who saw their version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; know it has nothing to do with the quality and style of our feature. My life isn&#x27;t going to be altered by what Rankin-Bass chooses to do badly.&quot; Years later, he called their film &quot;an awful, rip-off version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.&quot;

Bakshi found the two years spent on &quot;Rings&quot; immensely stressful, and the fan reaction scathing. He took comfort in talking to Priscilla Tolkien, who said she loved it, but got into an argument with Zaentz and refused to do Part Two. Reports vary as to whether the argument had to do with the dropping of the &quot;Part One&quot; subtitle or Bakshi&#x27;s fee for the sequel.

Bakshi said he was &quot;proud to have made part one&quot; and that his work was &quot;there for anyone who would make part two&quot;. In interviews leading up to the year 2000, he still toyed with the idea of making the sequel. For his part, Zaentz said he kept in touch with Bakshi, but confided to John Boorman that making the film was the worst experience of his life, which made him protective of the property. Indeed, he commented that the film &quot;wasn&#x27;t as good as we should have made&quot; and later remarked that an &quot;animated [film] couldn&#x27;t do it. It was just too complex for animated to handle it, with the emotion that was needed and the size and scope.&quot;

During development of the live-action films, Bakshi said he was approached by Warner Bros. to make the second part, but refused as he was angry of not being notified about the live-action film. He did use the renewed interest in his film to restore it to DVD, and had the final line redubbed to bolster the film&#x27;s sense of finality. After the live-action films found success, Bakshi stated that he would never have made the film if he had known what would happen during the production. He is quoted as saying that the reason he made the film was &quot;to save it for Tolkien, because I loved the &quot;Rings&quot; very much&quot;.
He concluded that the film made him realize that he was not interested in adapting another writer&#x27;s story.

==Legacy==
The film was adapted into comic book form with artwork by Spanish artist Luis Bermejo, under licence from Tolkien Enterprises. Three issues were published for the European market, starting in 1979, and were not published in the United States or translated into English due to copyright problems.
Warner Bros. (the rights holder to the post-September 1974 Rankin/Bass library and the Saul Zaentz theatrical library) first released the film on DVD and re-released on VHS in 2001 through the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label. While the VHS version ends with the narrator saying &quot;Here ends the first part of the history of the War of the Ring.&quot;, the DVD version has an alternate narration: &quot;The forces of darkness were driven forever from the face of Middle-Earth by the valiant friends of Frodo. As their gallant battle ended, so, too, ends the first great tale of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot; Later, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was released in a deluxe edition on Blu-ray and DVD on April 6, 2010. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was selected as the 36th greatest animated film by &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine, and ranked as the 90th greatest animated film of all time by the Online Film Critics Society.

<text>Leon N. Cooper (né Kupchik; February 28, 1930 – October 23, 2024) was an American theoretical physicist and neuroscientist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on superconductivity. Cooper developed the concept of Cooper pairs and collaborated with John Bardeen and John Robert Schrieffer to develop the BCS theory of conventional superconductivity. In neuroscience, Cooper co-developed the BCM theory of synaptic plasticity.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and education ===
Leon N. Kupchick was born in the Bronx, New York City on February 28, 1930. His middle initial N. does not stand for anything, though some sources erroneously suggested his middle name was Neil.

His father Irving Kupchik was from Belarus and moved to the United States after the Russian Revolution in 1917. His mother Anna (née Zola) Kupchik was from Poland; she died when Leon was seven. His father later changed the family&#x27;s surname from Kupchick to Cooper when he remarried.

Leon attended the Bronx High School of Science, graduating in 1947
He then studied at Columbia University in nearby Upper Manhattan, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1951. He remained at Columbia for graduate school, obtaining a Master of Arts degree in 1953 and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in 1954. His PhD was on the subject of muonic atoms, with Robert Serber as his thesis advisor.

=== Scientific career ===
Cooper spent one year as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. New Jersey. He then taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and Ohio State University before joining Brown University in 1958. He would remain at Brown for the rest of his career.

Cooper founded Brown&#x27;s Institute for Brain and Neural Systems in 1973, becoming its first director. In 1974 he was appointed Professor of Science at Brown, an endowed chair funded by Thomas J. Watson Sr. Cooper held visiting research positions at various institutions including the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, Switzerland.

Along with colleague Charles Elbaum, he founded the tech company Nestor in 1975, which sought commercial applications for artificial neural networks. Nestor partnered with Intel to develop the Ni1000 neural network computer chip in 1994.

=== Personal life ===

Cooper first married Martha Kennedy, with whom he had two daughters. In 1969, he married for a second time, to Kay Allard.
 He died at his home in Providence, Rhode Island, on October 23, 2024, at the age of 94.

== Research ==
=== Superconductivity ===

While Cooper was a postdoc in Princeton, he was approached by John Bardeen, a professor at the University of Illinois, and Bardeen&#x27;s graduate student John Robert Schrieffer. Bardeen and Schrieffer were working on superconductivity, a topic which was new to Cooper but he agreed to collaborate with them. Superconductivity had been experimentally discovered in 1911, but there was no theoretical explanation for the phenomenon. Cooper moved to Illinois as a postdoc to work with Bardeen.

After a year of theoretical investigation, Cooper developed the idea of a quasiparticle composed of two bound electrons, now known as a Cooper pair. Cooper published his concept of Cooper pairs in &quot;Physical Review&quot; in September 1956. The movement of Cooper pairs through a low-temperature metal would be almost unimpeded, producing a very low electrical resistance. After further development, Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer showed how this could produce superconductivity, publishing their theory in &quot;Physical Reviews&quot; in two papers during 1957. This theory became known as the BCS theory, after the authors&#x27; initials, and is widely accepted as the explanation for conventional superconductivity. Bardeen, Schrieffer and Cooper were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972 for their theory.

=== Neuroscience ===
After joining Brown University, Cooper became interested in neuroscience, particularly the process of learning. In 1982, Cooper and two doctoral students, Elie Bienenstock and Paul Munro, published their theory of synaptic plasticity in &quot;The Journal of Neuroscience&quot;. They estimated the weakening and strengthening of synapses that could occur without saturation of the connections. As synapses saturate, electrical connections become less effective, thereby reducing the saturation. Connections therefore oscillate between saturation and unsaturation without reaching their limits. Their theory explained how the visual cortex works and how people learn to see. It became known as the BCM theory, after the authors&#x27; initials.

<doc id="396614" wikidata="Q282263" url="?curid=396614" title="Yu Suzuki">
<text>is a Japanese game designer, producer, programmer, and engineer, who headed Sega&#x27;s AM2 team for 18 years. Considered one of the first auteurs of video games, he has been responsible for a number of Sega&#x27;s arcade hits, including three-dimensional sprite-scaling games that used &quot;taikan&quot; motion simulator arcade cabinets, such as &quot;Hang-On&quot;, &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, &quot;Out Run&quot; and &quot;After Burner&quot;, and pioneering polygonal 3D games such as &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, which are some of the games besides others from rival companies during that era credited with popularizing 3D graphics in video games; as well as the critically acclaimed &quot;Shenmue&quot; series. As a hardware engineer, he led the development of various arcade system boards, including the Sega Space Harrier, Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3, and was involved in the technical development of the Dreamcast console and its corresponding NAOMI arcade hardware.

In 2003, Suzuki became the sixth person to be inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences&#x27; Hall of Fame. &quot;IGN&quot; listed him at #9 in their Top 100 Game Creators of All Time list. In 2011, he received the Pioneer Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards.

==Career==
While studying at university, Yu Suzuki had written an undergraduate thesis on the subject of 3D computer graphics in video games.

===Sega AM2===
Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer. In his first year, he created a 2D boxing game called &quot;Champion Boxing&quot; for Sega&#x27;s first home game console, the SG-1000. According to Suzuki, the executive staff at Sega found the game so impressive that they released it in arcades as-is by simply installing an SG-1000 into an arcade cabinet. He was promoted to project leader while still in his first year at the company. Then, Suzuki began working on another arcade game which would prove to be the big stepping-off point of his career. &quot;To develop this game,&quot; Suzuki told &quot;G4TV&quot;, &quot;I rode on motorcycles a lot. When we came up with the prototype (for the arcades), I would ride on that prototype bike for hours and hours every day.&quot; His efforts culminated into the game &quot;Hang-On&quot;, released in 1985. &quot;Hang-On&quot; was a success as it broke new ground in arcade technology. It did not feature any traditional controls, as the movement of the on-screen avatar was dictated by the movements the player made with their body on the motorcycle cabinet. This began the &quot;Taikan&quot; trend, the use of motion-controlled hydraulic simulator arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles. The three-dimensional sprite/tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Suzuki stated that his &quot;designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D.&quot;

He soon followed with the 3D-esque third-person shooter game &quot;Space Harrier&quot; later that year. Showing his interest in Ferraris, Suzuki created the driving simulator &quot;Out Run&quot;, which was released in 1986. Although it didn&#x27;t officially feature a Ferrari, the player controlled a car that looked almost exactly like one. &quot;Out Run&quot; offered players a wide variety of driving paths and routes to complete the game, adding elements of nonlinear gameplay and increasing replay value. It also featured a radio with three songs to choose from as players drove through the wide variety of landscapes. At the Golden Joystick Awards, &quot;Out Run&quot; was awarded the Game of the Year award. Suzuki had been interested in 3D technology since his days in college. &quot;Space Harrier&quot; and &quot;Out Run&quot; had graphics similar to 3D, but could not fully utilize the capabilities.

Suzuki&#x27;s later hits included the jet fighting &quot;After Burner&quot; series in the late 1980s and the roller coaster kart racer &quot;Power Drift&quot; in 1988. Improving on the &quot;Super Scaler&quot; technology and road scrolling effects of &quot;Hang-On&quot; and &quot;Out Run&quot;, &quot;Power Drift&quot; created &quot;all of its track layouts with flat bitmaps&quot; to simulate a &quot;wholly 3D space using strictly 2D technology.&quot;

In 1990, Suzuki brought out a spiritual sequel to &quot;After Burner&quot; called &quot;G-LOC&quot;. It featured the R360, a gyroscopic motion cabinet that rotated 360 degrees to give players the realistic illusion of flying a fighter jet.

Yu Suzuki introduced and spearheaded the Model series of arcade hardware which would help lay the foundation for 3D arcade games for AM2 but other arcade departments at Sega as well In 1992, they released the 3D Formula 1 racer &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, which was considered one of, if not the most, realistic-looking arcade games on the market at that time. &quot;GameSpot&quot; listed it as one of the 15 most influential video games of all time, commenting: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t the first fully polygonal game on the market ... but along with &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, Sega&#x27;s 1993 release on the same hardware, it was one of the games alongside several others from different rival company developers that popularized polygonals to the masses.&quot;

In 1993, Suzuki created &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, the first 3D fighting game, which became enormously popular and spawned a series of sequels and spinoffs. It inspired many 3D fighting games such as the &quot;Tekken&quot; and &quot;Soul Calibur&quot; series. Some of the Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) staff involved in the creation of the original PlayStation console credit &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as inspiration for the PlayStation&#x27;s 3D graphics hardware. According to SCE&#x27;s former producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, the PlayStation was originally being considered as a 2D focused hardware, and it wasn&#x27;t until the success of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; in the arcades that they decided to design the PlayStation as a 3D focused hardware. &quot;1UP&quot; listed &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as one of the 50 most important games of all time. They credited it for creating the 3D fighting game genre, and more generally, demonstrating the potential of 3D polygon human characters (as the first to implement them in a useful way), showing the potential of realistic gameplay (introducing a character physics system and realistic character animations for the time), and introducing fighting game concepts such as the ring-out and the block button.

After developing the Sega Model 1, he worked on the development of the Sega Model 2. He acquired Lockheed Martin&#x27;s military texture mapping technology that cost millions and managed to engineer it down to $50 per chip, which he used to introduce texture-mapped 3D characters with &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;. The game industry gained mass-produced texture mapping as a result. &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; (1994) also introduced the use of motion capture animation technology, which was previously limited to the health industry. He then led the development of the Sega Model 3, which debuted with &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; described &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot; as &quot;the most astounding display of video game graphic muscle ever in the history of this industry.&quot; The &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series was recognized by the Smithsonian Institution, as an application which made great contributions to society in the field of art and entertainment. Suzuki also oversaw most of the home console conversions of AM2&#x27;s arcade games.

As a producer, he worked on games such as &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, which featured texture filtering in 1993, and &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, which in 1994 introduced 3D polygons to light gun shooters, and influenced the seminal 1997 first-person shooter &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;. Listing him in their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot;, &quot;Next Generation&quot; summarized that &quot;Nobody has pushed arcade gaming as far as Yu Suzuki, and Suzuki just keeps on pushing.&quot;

Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;Shenmue&quot; for the Dreamcast gave rise to a new style of adventure games, bending it away from the typical mold most games of its nature seem to fit into, with Suzuki&#x27;s own concept denoted as &quot;FREE&quot; (&quot;Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment&quot;). &quot;Shenmue&quot; was the most expensive game to be developed until &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; in 2008, with the whole project costing US$70 million, equivalent to US$93 million in 2011. &quot;Shenmue&quot; was a major step forward for 3D open world, nonlinear gameplay, touted as offering an unparalleled level of player freedom, giving them full reign to explore an expansive sandbox city with its own day-night cycles, changing weather, and fully voiced non-player characters going about their daily routines. The game&#x27;s large interactive environments, level of detail and the scope of its urban sandbox exploration has been compared to later sandbox games like &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; and its sequels, Sega&#x27;s own &quot;Yakuza&quot; series, &quot;Fallout 3&quot; and &quot;Deadly Premonition&quot;. The game also revived the quick time event mechanic and coined a name for it, &quot;QTE&quot;. The mechanic has since appeared in many later titles, including popular action games such as &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, &quot;God of War&quot;, &quot;Tomb Raider: Legend&quot;, &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot; and &quot;Robert Ludlum&#x27;s The Bourne Conspiracy&quot;.

Suzuki&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Ferrari F355 Challenge&quot; was a racing simulator created upon a strong partnership with Ferrari. Rubens Barrichello of the F1 Team Ferrari was quoted by Suzuki to &quot;have considered to purchase one for practicing.&quot; The game was considered the most accurate racing simulation of the Ferrari F355 possible up until that time.

After &quot;Shenmue II&quot;, he served as a producer for three last games, &quot;OutRun 2&quot; and &quot;Virtua Cop 3&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Sega Race TV&quot; in 2008. Hiroshi Kataoka succeeded him as head of AM2 department.

===Departure from Sega===
After his departure from AM2, Yu Suzuki was involved in three ill-fated projects as a director. &quot;PsyPhi&quot; was a touchscreen fighting arcade game, that initially had concepts of curved screens which never got past the concept stage. The game was however successfully completed with standard touchscreens, but was never shipped as it performed poorly at location testing. Players&#x27; fingers heated up from the friction of moving over the screen, making the game painful to play. Another problem was the viability of the machine in a modern arcade environment due to arcade operators preferring cheaper cabinets with more standard inputs. &quot;Shenmue Online&quot; was part of Sega&#x27;s initiative to penetrate the rising Asian MMO RPG markets. With the withdrawal of Sega&#x27;s online division in China, development of &quot;Shenmue Online&quot; was quietly cancelled. The development of &quot;Shenmue Online&quot; cost Sega and JCEntertainment almost $26 million. Another MMO called &quot;Pure Breed&quot; never got past the concept stage. It involved a western surrealist art style, and revolved around pet and human relationships.

In the spring of 2009, rumors surfaced that Yu Suzuki would step down from Sega after 26 years of employment. However, an article written by Brendan Sinclair, a reporter for the American video game journalism website &quot;GameSpot&quot;, stated the rumors to be false and that an anonymous representative for Sega of America revealed that Suzuki was in fact not retiring, but staying &quot;in a much more diminished capacity&quot; than in the past. Suzuki planned to officially leave Sega in September 2011 to concentrate on his own development studio Ys Net, while retaining an advisory role within Sega. His last position at Sega was Creative Officer along with Toshihiro Nagoshi and Hiroshi Kataoka. As of 2019, Suzuki remains as a consult for Sega, and suggested that he might return to the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; franchise.

===Ys Net===

In the fall of 2010, Suzuki returned with &quot;Shenmue City&quot;, developed by Sunsoft and Ys Net (Yu Suzuki&#x27;s new studio) for Yahoo Games. In December 2010, &quot;1UP&quot; posted an interview with Yu Suzuki. It was his first English interview in several years. It was also a career retrospective conducted by former &quot;1UP&quot; Editor in Chief James Mielke with Tak Hirai (both employees at Tetsuya Mizuguchi&#x27;s Q Entertainment). In March 2011, Yu Suzuki was at GDC to receive a pioneer award for his body of work. Prior to the award ceremony, he participated in an open panel career retrospective hosted by Mark Cerny. Also at GDC he participated with MEGA64 to record his voice for a parody video on &quot;how Shenmue was meant to end&quot;. In December 2011, Yu Suzuki flew to TGS (Toulouse Game Show) in France and participated in an open panel career retrospective. He also participated in an open with &quot;Tekken&quot; producer Katsuhiro Harada. They talked about their games and fought each other in both of their respected fighting franchises. In 2012, Suzuki designed a mobile game for the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series, titled &quot;Cool Champ&quot;. In 2013, Suzuki designed a new shooting game, titled &quot;Shooting Wars&quot; with Premium Agency; this was Ys Net&#x27;s first original game unrelated to any of Suzuki&#x27;s previous Sega franchises.

In July 2013, Suzuki traveled to Monaco to attend the Monaco Animé Game Show. On March 19, 2014, Yu Suzuki held a &quot;Shenmue&quot; postmortem at the Game Developers Conference 2014, with Suzuki discussing the development of &quot;Shenmue&quot;. In June the same year, Yu Suzuki received a &quot;Legend Award&quot; in Barcelona, Spain during Gamelab Barcelona 2014.

On June 16, 2015, &quot;Shenmue III&quot; was revealed at E3 as a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. It became the fastest game ever to reach the one million dollar funding mark on the Kickstarter platform, ultimately raising 6.33 million dollars. Suzuki began his work as director of &quot;Shenmue III&quot;″s development immediately following the successful funding campaign in July 2015. On February 27, 2016, Suzuki appeared as a guest presenter at the annual Monaco Anime Games International Conferences (MAGIC), where he showed images and video clips of the development progress for &quot;Shenmue III&quot; to conference attendees.

On June 22, 2022, YS-Net released &quot;Air Twister&quot; exclusively to Apple Arcade. YS Net has continued to support the game with regular updates and expanded content.

<text>John Robert Schrieffer (; May 31, 1931 – July 27, 2019) was an American physicist who, with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper, was a recipient of the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physics for developing the BCS theory, the first successful quantum theory of superconductivity.

== Life and career ==
Schrieffer was born in Oak Park, Illinois, the son of Louise (Anderson) and John Henry Schrieffer. His family moved in 1940 to Manhasset, New York, and then in 1947 to Eustis, Florida, where his father, a former pharmaceutical salesman, began a career in the citrus industry. In his Florida days, Schrieffer enjoyed playing with homemade rockets and ham radio, a hobby that sparked an interest in electrical engineering.

After graduating from Eustis High School in 1949, Schrieffer was admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where for two years he majored in electrical engineering before switching to physics in his junior year. He completed a bachelor&#x27;s thesis on multiplets in heavy atoms under the direction of John C. Slater in 1953. Pursuing an interest in solid-state physics, Schrieffer began graduate studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he was hired immediately as a research assistant to Bardeen. After working out a theoretical problem of electrical conduction on semiconductor surfaces, Schrieffer spent a year in the laboratory, applying the theory to several surface problems. In his third year of graduate studies, he joined Bardeen and Cooper in developing the theory of superconductivity.

Schrieffer recalled that in January 1957 he was on a subway in New York City when he had an idea of how to describe mathematically the ground state of superconducting electrons. Schrieffer and Bardeen&#x27;s collaborator Cooper had discovered that electrons in a superconductor are grouped in pairs, now called Cooper pairs, and that the motions of all Cooper pairs within a single superconductor are correlated and function as a single entity due to phonon-electron interactions. Schrieffer&#x27;s mathematical breakthrough was to describe the behavior of all Cooper pairs at the same time, instead of each individual pair. The day after returning to Illinois, Schrieffer showed his equations to Bardeen, who immediately realized they were the solution to the problem. The BCS theory (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) of superconductivity, as it is now known, accounted for more than 30 years of experimental results that had stymied some of the greatest theorists in physics.

After completing his doctoral dissertation on the theory of superconductivity, Schrieffer spent the 1957–1958 academic year as a National Science Foundation fellow at the University of Birmingham in England and at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he continued research into superconductivity. Following a year as assistant professor at the University of Chicago, he returned to the University of Illinois in 1959 as a faculty member. In 1960, he went back to the Bohr Institute for a summer visit, during which he became engaged to Anne Grete Thomsen whom he married at Christmas of that year. Two years later, Schrieffer joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and, in 1964, Schrieffer published his book on the BCS theory, Theory of Superconductivity. He held honorary degrees from the Technical University of Munich and the University of Geneva. In 1968 Schrieffer, along with Cooper, were awarded the Comstock Prize in Physics from the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize by the American Physical Society the same year.

Schrieffer was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1971. In 1972, he, along with Bardeen and Cooper, won the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physics for developing the BCS theory. Schrieffer was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1975. In 1980, Schrieffer became a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and rose to chancellor professor in 1984, serving as director of the university&#x27;s Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. In 1992, Florida State University appointed Schrieffer as a university eminent scholar professor and chief scientist of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, where he continued to pursue one of the great goals in physics: room temperature superconductivity.

On September 24, 2004, while driving with a suspended license, Schrieffer was involved in an automobile accident that killed one person and injured seven others.
Schrieffer was said to have fallen asleep at the wheel of his car. On November 6, 2005, he was sentenced to two years in prison for vehicular manslaughter. Schrieffer was incarcerated in Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility at Rock Mountain near San Diego, California.

He died in late July 2019 at a nursing facility in Florida while sleeping. He was 88 years old.

<doc id="396619" wikidata="Q225869" url="?curid=396619" title="Descriptive set theory">
<text>In mathematical logic, descriptive set theory (DST) is the study of certain classes of &quot;well-behaved&quot; subsets of the real line and other Polish spaces. As well as being one of the primary areas of research in set theory, it has applications to other areas of mathematics such as functional analysis, ergodic theory, the study of operator algebras and group actions, and mathematical logic.

== Polish spaces ==

Descriptive set theory begins with the study of Polish spaces and their Borel sets.

A Polish space is a second-countable topological space that is metrizable with a complete metric. Heuristically, it is a complete separable metric space whose metric has been &quot;forgotten&quot;. Examples include the real line formula_1, the Baire space formula_2, the Cantor space formula_3, and the Hilbert cube formula_4.

=== Universality properties ===

The class of Polish spaces has several universality properties, which show that there is no loss of generality in considering Polish spaces of certain restricted forms.

* Every Polish space is homeomorphic to a &quot;G&quot;δ subspace of the Hilbert cube, and every &quot;G&quot;δ subspace of the Hilbert cube is Polish.
* Every Polish space is obtained as a continuous image of Baire space; in fact every Polish space is the image of a continuous bijection defined on a closed subset of Baire space. Similarly, every compact Polish space is a continuous image of Cantor space.

Because of these universality properties, and because the Baire space formula_2 has the convenient property that it is homeomorphic to formula_6, many results in descriptive set theory are proved in the context of Baire space alone.

== Borel sets ==

The class of Borel sets of a topological space &quot;X&quot; consists of all sets in the smallest σ-algebra containing the open sets of &quot;X&quot;. This means that the Borel sets of &quot;X&quot; are the smallest collection of sets such that:
* Every open subset of &quot;X&quot; is a Borel set.
* If &quot;A&quot; is a Borel set, so is formula_7. That is, the class of Borel sets are closed under complementation. 
* If &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a Borel set for each natural number &quot;n&quot;, then the union formula_8 is a Borel set. That is, the Borel sets are closed under countable unions.

A fundamental result shows that any two uncountable Polish spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are Borel isomorphic: there is a bijection from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; such that the preimage of any Borel set is Borel, and the image of any Borel set is Borel. This gives additional justification to the practice of restricting attention to Baire space and Cantor space, since these and any other Polish spaces are all isomorphic at the level of Borel sets.

=== Borel hierarchy ===

Each Borel set of a Polish space is classified in the Borel hierarchy based on how many times the operations of countable union and complementation must be used to obtain the set, beginning from open sets. The classification is in terms of countable ordinal numbers. For each nonzero countable ordinal &quot;α&quot; there are classes formula_9, formula_10, and formula_11. 
* Every open set is declared to be formula_12.
* A set is declared to be formula_10 if and only if its complement is formula_9.
* A set &quot;A&quot; is declared to be formula_15, &quot;δ&quot; &gt; 1, if there is a sequence 〈 &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; 〉 of sets, each of which is formula_16 for some &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) &lt; &quot;δ&quot;, such that formula_17.
* A set is formula_11 if and only if it is both formula_9 and formula_10.

A theorem shows that any set that is formula_9 or formula_10 is formula_23, and any formula_24 set is both formula_9 and formula_10 for all &quot;α&quot; &gt; &quot;β&quot;. Thus the hierarchy has the following structure, where arrows indicate inclusion.

=== Regularity properties of Borel sets ===

Classical descriptive set theory includes the study of regularity properties of Borel sets. For example, all Borel sets of a Polish space have the property of Baire and the perfect set property. Modern descriptive set theory includes the study of the ways in which these results generalize, or fail to generalize, to other classes of subsets of Polish spaces.

== Analytic and coanalytic sets ==

Just beyond the Borel sets in complexity are the analytic sets and coanalytic sets. A subset of a Polish space &quot;X&quot; is analytic if it is the continuous image of a Borel subset of some other Polish space. Although any continuous preimage of a Borel set is Borel, not all analytic sets are Borel sets. A set is coanalytic if its complement is analytic.

== Projective sets and Wadge degrees ==

Many questions in descriptive set theory ultimately depend upon set-theoretic considerations and the properties of ordinal and cardinal numbers. This phenomenon is particularly apparent in the projective sets. These are defined via the projective hierarchy on a Polish space &quot;X&quot;:
* A set is declared to be formula_27 if it is analytic.
* A set is formula_28 if it is coanalytic.
* A set &quot;A&quot; is formula_29 if there is a formula_30 subset &quot;B&quot; of formula_31 such that &quot;A&quot; is the projection of &quot;B&quot; to the first coordinate.
* A set &quot;A&quot; is formula_32 if there is a formula_33 subset &quot;B&quot; of formula_31 such that &quot;A&quot; is the projection of &quot;B&quot; to the first coordinate. 
* A set is formula_35 if it is both formula_30 and formula_33 .

As with the Borel hierarchy, for each &quot;n&quot;, any formula_38 set is both formula_29 and formula_32.

The properties of the projective sets are not completely determined by ZFC. Under the assumption &quot;V = L&quot;, not all projective sets have the perfect set property or the property of Baire. However, under the assumption of projective determinacy, all projective sets have both the perfect set property and the property of Baire. This is related to the fact that ZFC proves Borel determinacy, but not projective determinacy.

There are also generic extensions of formula_41 for any natural number formula_42 in which formula_43 consists of all the lightface formula_44 subsets of formula_45.

More generally, the entire collection of sets of elements of a Polish space &quot;X&quot; can be grouped into equivalence classes, known as Wadge degrees, that generalize the projective hierarchy. These degrees are ordered in the Wadge hierarchy. The axiom of determinacy implies that the Wadge hierarchy on any Polish space is well-founded and of length Θ, with structure extending the projective hierarchy.

== Borel equivalence relations ==

A contemporary area of research in descriptive set theory studies Borel equivalence relations. A Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space &quot;X&quot; is a Borel subset of formula_31 that is an equivalence relation on &quot;X&quot;.

== Effective descriptive set theory ==

The area of effective descriptive set theory combines the methods of descriptive set theory with those of generalized recursion theory (especially hyperarithmetical theory). In particular, it focuses on lightface analogues of hierarchies of classical descriptive set theory. Thus the hyperarithmetic hierarchy is studied instead of the Borel hierarchy, and the analytical hierarchy instead of the projective hierarchy. This research is related to weaker versions of set theory such as Kripke–Platek set theory and second-order arithmetic.
