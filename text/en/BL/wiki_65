<text>General Andrew George Latta McNaughton (25 February 1887 – 11 July 1966) was a Canadian electrical engineer, scientist, army officer, cabinet minister, and diplomat.

Before the First World War, McNaughton was a professor of engineering at McGill University. During the war he distinguished himself as an officer of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, was wounded twice and was twice awarded the Distinguished Service Order. In the interwar period, McNaughton served as Chief of the General Staff, where he was instrumental in modernizing and mechanizing the Canadian Army.

McNaughton commanded major Canadian field units in the first half of the Second World War and served as the commander of the First Canadian Army until he was relieved in 1943. He then served as Minister of National Defence until the end of the war. During his tenure as Minister, McNaughton was involved in the crisis surrounding the decision to send conscripts, known as &quot;Zombies,&quot; for overseas service.

== Early life ==
McNaughton was born in Moosomin, District of Assiniboia, North-West Territories (now part of Saskatchewan), on 25 February 1887. Both of McNaughton&#x27;s parents were immigrants from Scotland, and his youth was a happy one, being brought up by an adventuresome father who had once been a trader in buffalo hides and a kindly, loving mother. His upbringing on a farm instilled in him a life-long love of hard work and self-discipline. McNaughton spent his free time riding horses across the vast expanses of the Prairies while also engaging in hunting and fishing. McNaughton credited his youth on a frontier farm on the Prairies with making him tough and hardy. His parents had both converted to the Church of England, voted Conservative and like many other Anglo-Canadians in the Victorian era strongly identified with the British Empire.

McNaughton held to a specific Scottish-Canadian identity, which led him to a sense of Canadian nationalism based on his feeling that the British Empire was dominated by the English while Canada was dominated by Scottish-Canadians like himself, but his biographer John Rickard noted &quot;...even though he would come into conflict with British generals, he always held the British people and their accomplishments in a high regard&quot;. McNaughton always attended Anglican services, and though he was devoted to science, believing that the pure rationality of science was the best solution to the world&#x27;s problems, he never seems to have any difficulty in reconciling his faith in the Anglican church with his faith in science. Despite being a member of the Church of England, he was always very proud of his Scottish heritage.

McNaughton was a student at Bishop&#x27;s College School in Lennoxville, Quebec, after winning a scholarship. At Bishop&#x27;s, McNaughton was both successful student and an athlete. In 1905, he entered McGill University in Montreal where he studied under the New Zealander physicist Ernest Rutherford. As a student, his grades were outstanding, and he was singled out by Rutherford as a man to watch. As an undergraduate, he applied for a commission in the Indian Army with the hope of a joining a famous cavalry regiment, saying it been his boyhood dream to serve the British Empire in India. He joined the Canadian non-permanent Militia in 1909. and earned a B.A. in physics and engineering from McGill University in Montreal in 1910, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society, and earned an MSc with Honours in Electrical Engineering in 1912. He then stayed on at McGill as an instructor as a professor of engineering until the outbreak of the Great War.

His work in engineering innovation led to his invention of a cathode ray direction finder – a form of the technology that would evolve into radar. In 1914, he married Mabel Weir of Montreal, who was Irish and Catholic.

==First World War==
While still a student at McGill, McNaughton joined the Canadian Militia in 1909. He took the 4th Battery of the Canadian Expeditionary Force overseas with the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914 and arrived in France in February 1915. In March 1916 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and went to England to take command of the newly arrived 11 (Howitzer) Brigade of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, taking it to France in July. In February 1917 he was appointed the Counter Battery Staff Officer of the Canadian Corps. Lieutenant-General Sir Julian Byng, the British commander of the Canadian Corps from 1916−1917, when Lieutenant General Arthur Currie succeeded him, personally selected McNaughton, saying that while McNaughton was a relatively young man, he had already heard much about his work, hence his promotion from the command of a brigade to senior position with the corps command. On the day before the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, at 31 years old, he was promoted to brigadier general and appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Canadian Corps Artillery.

During the war, he was wounded twice and received multiple decorations. McNaughton did not demand the normal privileges of an officer, living alongside his men and eating the same food, and was noted for his care for his men. McNaughton slept on the floor, consumed the same bully beef rations as the average soldier, saying he was a farm boy at heart and did not need a bed or better food while preferring to be addressed as Andy instead of by his rank. McNaughton was very popular with the men who served under him, who regarded him as their friend who represented their interests instead of the high command.

Particularly after being promoted to Corps Counter Battery Staff Officer, McNaughton used his expertise in engineering to help make advances in the science of artillery particularly in pinpointing artillery targets, both stationary and moving. His acumen and expertise is often pointed to as a key to the Canadian success in the Battle of Vimy Ridge where McNaughton&#x27;s innovations in the detection of German artillery positions with flash-spotting and sound-ranging led to the Canadians accurately mapping the vast majority of German gun positions before the infantry were sent into battle. A technique McNaughton had developed to measure the wear on cannon barrels and make adjustments to their aiming proved to be vital on April 9, 1917, when the Canadian Corps assaulted Vimy Ridge. As the battle commenced, the combination of accurately plotted German gun positions and deadly accurate Canadian artillery fire led to precise strikes that eliminated over 80% of enemy artillery and machine guns, significantly blunting their defences. As the infantry attacked, precise artillery fire allowed the effective implementation of the creeping barrage which proved vital to the success of the infantry advance.

At Vimy, the counter-battery team under McNaughton&#x27;s command knocked out 83% of the 212 German artillery guns on Vimy Ridge in the first two hours, making it possible for the infantry of the Canadian Corps to advance up the heights and take the ridge. Vimy Ridge had been unsuccessfully assaulted by the French with heavy losses in 1915 and likewise by the British in 1916, making it into a symbol of German power on the Western Front, a massive and heavily fortified ridge towering over the front that was widely considered impossible to take. The fact that the four divisions of the Canadian Corps in their first battle together took Vimy Ridge in two days led to the battle taking on a legendary aura in Canada that it retains to this day. McNaughton&#x27;s role in using operational research to map out precisely where the German artillery guns were on Vimy Ridge and then taking them out made his reputation. The fact that McNaughton was only 30 at the time further marked him out as an outstanding gunner.

His most serious wound occurred on 5 February 1918 when he was hit by the fragments of a German shell, requiring a stay in a hospital. That same month, he received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Later in the year, a bar was added to his DSO, with the bar&#x27;s citation reading:

By war&#x27;s end, McNaughton was widely considered to be the most talented and capable artilleryman in any army. General Sir Frederick Pile, of the British Army&#x27;s Royal Artillery, who served alongside McNaughton in the First World War wrote in 1918 that McNaughton was &quot;probably the best and most scientific gunner in any army in the world. His ideas were colossal.&quot;

== Interwar period ==

=== Chief of the General staff ===
In 1920 McNaughton joined the regular army and in 1922 was promoted to Deputy Chief of the General Staff and Chief of the General Staff in 1929. During that time he worked at mechanizing the army and modernizing the militia. In 1919, it became necessary to integrate the numbered battalions of the returning Canadian Expeditionary Force with the old militia regiments, the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden created the Otter committee headed by General Sir William Otter. In general, the Otter committee tended to create as many regiments as possible across the country, but McNaughton, who served on the Otter committee, ensured Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, which had been privately raised in 1914, was taken on by the &quot;permanent force militia&quot; as a regiment for western Canada. Likewise, McNaughton ensured that the 22nd Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force was not disbanded, arguing that the 22nd Battalion, which came from Quebec and won more battle honours than any other Canadian battalion, should be kept on to show the army appreciated the sacrifices of French Canadians in the war. The 22nd Battalion was assigned to the &quot;permanent force militia&quot; as the 22nd Regiment, becoming the Royal 22nd Regiment in 1922, and went on to become the most famous French-Canadian regiment in the Canadian Army. McNaughton wrote the part of the Otter committee&#x27;s report which stated the &quot;principal peril&quot; to Canada was &quot;the danger of the overthrow of Law and Order&quot; by &quot;Bolshevik agitators&quot;, whom the report in a xenophobic note stated were mostly immigrants from Eastern Europe. McNaughton wrote that the best way of defeating the &quot;Bolshevik peril&quot; was &quot;to have immediately available an efficient military body with which to overawe this unruly element, and secondly, by education, to convert them from their perverted ideals to a true conception of citizenship&quot;. As such, McNaughton envisioned the militia as primarily an internal security force that was intended to fulfil the role of &quot;aid to civil power&quot;.

McNaughton was described as &quot;a forceful dynamic thruster with a tornado-like intellect&quot;, whom the historian James Eayrs wrote &quot;dominated his colleagues in the military establishment as a great oak dominates a scrub forest&quot;. At the same time, McNaughton was referred to as &quot;a master military bureaucratic politician&quot; who fought hard for more funding for defence and as a general who was so interested in scientific problems who had &quot;attacks of the gadgets&quot; during staff meetings, as he was always fascinated by science and technology. McNaughton remained active as a scientist throughout his military career, being regularly published in various scientific journals. To secure more military funding from hostile politicians, McNaughton, whom many viewed as the most powerful civil servant in Ottawa during the interwar period, pushed strongly for northern development. As part of his plans to develop the far north of Canada, McNaughton pressed for the aerial mapping and survey of the north (much of which was still unmapped as late as the 1930s), which increased the budget for the Royal Canadian Air Force and for the building of the Northwest Territories and Yukon Radio System, which increased the budget for the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. McNaughton&#x27;s interests reached beyond the military as he became the most powerful civil servant in Ottawa in the interwar period, and promoted the militia as a &quot;school for the nation.&quot; He argued that the &quot;foundations of military efficiency&quot; rested upon providing a patriotic education to male citizens by way of their service in the militia, which would lead to the &quot;creation of a national spirit,&quot; the fostering of which McNaughton tended to see as his principal duty.

As a &quot;gunner&quot; (artilleryman), McNaughton favoured promoting officers from the artillery and engineers over the cavalry and infantry, increasing the portion of general staff officers with a background in the technical services well above the 50% already reached in 1922. Officers from the cavalry and the infantry complained that under McNaughton&#x27;s leadership the &quot;gunners&quot; were holding most of the senior positions. In 1929–30, McNaughton came into major conflict with the Defence Minister, Colonel James Ralston, a highly decorated veteran who considered himself just as much an expert on defence matters as McNaughton, something that caused considerable vexation between the Chief of Staff and the Minister of National Defence. Ralston vetoed McNaughton&#x27;s plans to upgrade the equipment of the permanent force militia and to build more arsenals, saying that the Liberals would not be &quot;Merchants of Death&quot;. Had the Liberals won the 1930 election, McNaughton was planning to resign as he did not want to serve any longer under Ralston.

McNaughton was a friend of the Conservative leader Richard Bennett and in the 1930 election, secretly reviewed drafts of his campaign speeches and in 1935 when Bennett swung to the left with his &quot;New Deal&quot;, McNaughton likewise secretly suggested improvements to his speeches. It was during the years 1930–35 when Bennett was Prime Minister that McNaughton was at the height of his influence in Ottawa. During the interwar period, McNaughton was widely credited with inventing the cathode ray tube, which enhanced his reputation as a brilliant scientist-general, making him the best-known Canadian soldier and scientist around the world. In 1933, when the Bennett government brought in the &quot;Big Cut&quot; to defence spending, ordering the defence department to cut $3.6 million at once, McNaughton tried very hard to abolish the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), arguing that Canada did not need a navy and without a navy, the defence department would save $2 million/per year. In a lengthy bureaucratic battle, Commodore Walter Hose of the Royal Canadian Navy argued to the Bennett government that McNaughton was wrong to dismiss sea power as he did, and with Japan showing expansionist tendencies as proven by the seizing the Manchuria region of China in 1931, that Canada did need a navy. The RCN was almost abolished in 1933, but for Hose&#x27;s efforts to save it. McNaughton&#x27;s Army-centered arguments for abolishing the RCN left a lasting bitterness between the two services that lasted decades.

The Canadian historian Colonel John English wrote that McNaughton, for all his intelligence and drive, had an overall deleterious effect on the Canadian military, describing him as a general who was so caught up in his scientific studies that he neglected military issues. McNaughton shared the long-standing hostility felt by most Canadians to a professional army and believed that a well-trained militia was all that was needed. In 1931, McNaughton forcefully stated his belief that &quot;a Citizen Militia...is the proper type of Land Defence Force for Canada,&quot; and that the &quot;permanent force militia&quot; (a euphemism for the professional army) should serve as the &quot;instructional corps&quot; for the militia. McNaughton did not see the importance of training officers for the operational level of war, writing that the &quot;foundations of military efficiency&quot; were the education of Canadian men and that the &quot;creation of a national spirit&quot; suitable for war: he argued that the &quot;technical efficiency in the various arms and services... would readily follow,&quot; for all that was required to prepare for war was &quot;...merely a matter of drill and training combined with careful selection of suitable material&quot;. Reflecting his strongly scientific bent, McNaughton wrote what was needed were officers well trained in science like himself and that &quot;a highly scientific army requiring highly trained personnel...[could] be best obtained quite outside the army itself&quot;. One consequence of this way of viewing war was that McNaughton cut the funding for the training of infantry and cavalry officers while ensuring the majority of the officer training went to those in artillery, engineer and signals branches. As a result, the majority of officers holding senior positions in the Canadian Army in World War II were artillerymen, engineers and signals men. As early as 1933 there were complaints from infantry officers that &quot;the gunners&quot; as artillerymen were known were monopolizing the senior positions as McNaughton himself was a &quot;gunner&quot;. In 1932, Brigadier James Sutherland Brown wrote about McNaughton: &quot;the C.G.S is a super-engineer and college professor by profession. He is a gunner in the Canadian Militia and, technically, he is a good one. He is cold, calculating, touchy, and determined to pursue his own schemes, inclined to do everything himself and will not take advice&quot;. McNaughton insisted that officers seeking high command attend courses at the Imperial Defence College which provided much training for questions of grand strategy. English described McNaughton as having neglected the study of war on the operational level, which did not interest him in the same way that grand strategy and science did.

=== Formation of relief camps ===
By the summer of 1932, due to the massive unemployment caused by the Great Depression, Canada had become poverty-stricken with much of the populace left destitute. While on a tour of the nation&#x27;s military establishments General McNaughton was shocked by the spectacle of homeless men living in shacks, begging on the streets of Western cities and swarming aboard freight trains to move on to the next town or city in search of a job. McNaughton recognized this as a situation where the possibility of revolution didn&#x27;t seem unrealistic. In October he presented a proposal eagerly grasped by Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, that had two aims. It would get the men off the streets, out of the cities and out of sight, and, at the same time improve their bodies and provide useful work in a group of camps, run by the military. In the so-called &quot;relief camps&quot; men would be fed, clothed and housed, and would work on projects of national importance—building airfields, highways and other public works. As an &quot;alternative to bloodshed on the streets,&quot; this stop-gap solution for unemployment was to establish military-run and -styled relief camps in remote areas throughout the country, where single unemployed men toiled for twenty cents a day.

What appeared to be a humanitarian effort to aid the unemployed and indigent and prevent the propagation of revolution soon turned into a hotbed of dissent due to the draconian disciplinary measures adopted. Portions of a letter smuggled out read to the House of Commons by J. S. Woodsworth, MP for Winnipeg North Centre described the conditions.

&quot;Picture to yourself a tarpaper shack 79 feet x 24 with no windows, along each side there is a row of double decker bunks, these are spaced off with 8 × 1 board so that there is room for two men in each bunk. The bunks are filled with straw and you crawl into them from the foot end. Along the front of the lower bunk a narrow board is placed upon which the men may sit. The place is very meagerly lighted and ventilation by three skylights... So narrow is the passageway between the bunks that when the men are sitting on the bench there is scarcely room to pass between them. This shack houses 88 men... At times the place reeks of the foul smell and at night the air is simply fetid. The floor is dirty and the end of the shack where the men wash ... is caked with black mud. The toilet is thoroughly filthy, unsanitary, and far too small.&quot;

The irony was that McNaughton&#x27;s scheme for staving off revolution had the seeds of revolution inherent in it. Within two years the camps that had been greeted with such applause would be known throughout the country as slave camps. The &quot;volunteer inmates&quot; were not allowed newspapers, magazines or radios. Any man who left a camp, even for a visit to his family, was subsequently refused re-entry and the &quot;dole&quot; was denied to him.

== National Research Council of Canada ==
He returned for a few years to civilian life and from 1935 to 1939 was head of the National Research Council of Canada. National Research Council Building M50 on the Ottawa Campus was named the McNaughton Building, in his honour.

IEEE honours McNaughton in the naming of the McNaughton Award, presented annually for excellence in engineering.

== Second World War ==
As the best known Canadian soldier, McNaughton was the natural choice to lead the Canadian Expeditionary Force to Europe; the fact that McNaughton was vocally opposed to conscription, insisting that an all-volunteer force was all that was needed to win the war endeared him to the then Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had promised in September 1939 that there would be no overseas conscription. In September 1939, the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; Premier of Quebec, Maurice Duplessis, had called a snap election with the aim of seeking a mandate to oppose the war, and to defeat Duplessis, Mackenzie King had promised the people of Quebec there would no overseas conscription. Having McNaughton as a professional soldier endorse Mackenzie King&#x27;s no overseas conscription views as militarily sound and correct gave the prime minister a potent political shield to wield against those in English Canada who called for overseas conscription. Furthermore, McNaughton&#x27;s views that the correct way to defeat Germany was through a series of methodical, &quot;scientific&quot; operations in which artillery was to play the dominant role promised to minimize casualties, which was the all-important consideration for Mackenzie King who wanted to avoid battles with heavy casualties as that would force him to make a difficult decision about conscription. Mackenzie King had remembered how the heavy losses taken by the Canadian Expeditionary Force in the battles from 1915 to 1917 had led to the Conscription Crisis of 1917, as by 1917 the government of Sir Robert Borden had the choice of either pulling the Canadian Corps out of action or bring in conscription, and he very much wanted to avoid a repeat.

===Division commander===
McNaughton commanded the newly raised 1st Canadian Infantry Division during the early part of the Second World War, and led the division overseas, first to the United Kingdom in December 1939 and later to France in June 1940, only to be withdrawn back to England in the final stages of the Battle of France. McNaughton, who was known for his care for his men, ensuring that the Canadian soldiers sent to Britain had the best possible accommodations, was always very popular with the rank and file of the Canadian Army. As the best known Canadian general in the world, McNaughton attracted much media attention in Canada, the United Kingdom and even the neutral United States as the great &quot;soldier-scientist&quot;, making the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine on 18 December 1939, which predicated that McNaughton was the Allied general most likely to take Berlin. In April 1940, when the British government asked McNaughton&#x27;s permission to send the 1st Canadian Division to Norway, McNaughton agreed, though the Norwegian campaign ended in defeat before the Canadians could arrive. As Mackenzie King was visiting the United States at the time to see President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the acting prime minister in Ottawa was the finance minister, Colonel Ralston, who still very much disliked McNaughton. Ralston chose to make an issue of the fact that McNaughton had agreed to send the 1st Division to Norway without consulting Ottawa first, saying this was an illegal act. McNaughton felt that he acted legally as he sought an opinion from the Deputy Judge Advocate, Price Montague about the legality of sending the 1st Division to Norway before agreeing first, exploded in rage about &quot;politicians trying to run the war while 3,000 miles away&quot;.

In June 1940, McNaughton&#x27;s old nemesis, Colonel Ralston, was brought back by Mackenzie King as Defence Minister after Norman Rogers, the previous defence minister, was killed in an airplane clash. Relations between Ralston and McNaughton remained unfriendly as they had been in 1929–30. In a reversal of the expected roles, General McNaughton insisted as a professional soldier that overseas conscription was unsound while Ralston, the civilian minister of defence, was more open to the idea of overseas conscription. Ernest Côté, one of the officers on McNaughton&#x27;s staff was astonished to see McNaughton call up Ralston in Ottawa to make a complaint about the appearance of Canadian Army trucks on aesthetic grounds, saying he wanted Ralston to send over more aesthetically pleasing trucks as the current trucks were too ugly for his liking. In an interview with the historian Jack Granatstein, Côté described McNaughton as a man who was universally admired and liked by the officers who served under him, but he stated that he had nagging doubts about McNaughtons&#x27; fitness for high command, saying he had an obsessive personality for whom no detail was too small. McNaughton&#x27;s relations with the first two Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Edmund Ironside and Field Marshal John Dill, were excellent as he served alongside both men in the Great War and counted them as amongst his friends.

===Corps and army commander===
Now promoted to lieutenant general, he commanded VII Corps from July to December 1940 when it was renamed the Canadian Corps. Then under his leadership the Canadian Army in the United Kingdom, reinforced with the II Canadian Corps, and the Canadian Corps being redesignated as the I Canadian Corps, was organized into the Canadian First Army in April 1942. McNaughton&#x27;s contribution to the development of new techniques was outstanding, especially in the field of detection and weaponry, including the discarding sabot projectile. Tensions between Ralston and McNaughton were increased in December 1941 after the fall of Hong Kong and the loss of the entire C Force when McNaughton in an &quot;off-the-record&quot; interview with the media blamed Ralston, saying he was &quot;completely unfitted for the job&quot; and that C Force should never had been sent to Hong Kong.

Mackenzie King preferred to keep the First Canadian Army in Britain to guard against a possible German invasion, which had the convenient effect of keeping the Canadians out of action and ensured no casualties, meaning no decision was necessary about overseas conscription. McNaughton very much wanted to keep all five divisions of the First Canadian Army together, insisting he would not allow a division or two to be detached from his command to go to North Africa as he wanted all of the Canadian units to fight together. As a result, the Canadian units languished in Britain, guarding against a possible invasion of Britain that no one felt was very likely after Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, was launched in June 1941, while British, Australian, New Zealand, South African and Indian troops fought in North Africa and the Middle East. While the other Commonwealth units were fighting the North African campaign, many of the Canadian officers and enlisted men in Britain were jealous of the way of the other Commonwealth units were winning glory in North Africa while they had to sit on the sidelines of the war. In the spring of 1942, when McNaughton was approached by Admiral Louis Mountbatten with a request that the 2nd Canadian Division take part in a raid on the French city of Dieppe, McNaughton jumped at the chance to finally get one of his divisions into action.

McNaughton was unduly blamed for the disastrous Dieppe Raid in August 1942, which saw the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General John Hamilton Roberts, sustain heavy casualties, blame better deserved by the British who failed to provide needed, requested, and promised support. General Sir Alan Brooke, the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), his opponent since the First World War, frequently criticized him. Brooke had been the Staff Officer Royal Artillery in the Canadian Corps during the First World War and organized the &quot;creeping barrages&quot; in support of the assaults at the Battle of Vimy Ridge.

===Relief of army command===
McNaughton&#x27;s reputation was badly damaged by the Exercise Spartan war games held on 4–12 March 1943, which he described as &quot;a dress rehearsal for the full-scale invasion of the Continent&quot;. McNaughton commanding the First Canadian Army had the task of breaking out over the river Thames to &quot;take&quot; Huntingdon, which was the &quot;capital&quot; of the fictional country of &quot;Eastland&quot;, which was defended by VIII Corps and XI Corps of the British Army. Much of the criticism of McNaughton&#x27;s leadership was over his decision on the night of 7 March 1943 to leave his command post to personally supervise the building of a bridge over the Thames, instead of sending out an engineer officer to build the bridge. This showed that McNaughton was unable to delegate authority properly as he insisted on doing everything himself, leading to command paralysis. McNaughton did not understand war on the operational level, and Colonel English wrote: &quot;That McNaughton had no idea that a corps required a minimum of 24 hour warning in order to execute a major task is borne out by the following timings: at 23:35 on 6 March, he directed 2 Corps to advance east across the Thames through 1 Corps; at 16:15, the next day he gave counter orders to effect the western envelopment that night; at 21:30 on 10 March he issued orders for operations the following day; and at 22:59 11 March, he gave orders for operations on 12 March&quot;. Sir James Grigg, the British War Secretary, who attended the Spartan war game wrote he was &quot;appalled at McNaughton&#x27;s indecision&quot; as &quot;he stood in front of his situation map hesitating as to what to do and what orders to issue&quot;. General Alan Brooke, who also attended the Spartan war game wrote in his diary that the Spartan war game had done much to &quot;proving my worse fear that ... McNaughton is quite incompetent to command an army!&quot;. The man who was to replace McNaughton as commander of the First Canadian Army, General Harry Crerar, later wrote that during the Spartan war game &quot;that it became patently obvious to all&quot; that McNaughton &quot;was totally unsuitable for high operational command&quot;. Spartan ended in the &quot;defeat&quot; of the Canadians as McNaughton was unable to break out over the Thames to &quot;take&quot; Huntingdon&quot;.

In the spring of 1943, Mackenzie King, who until then had tried to keep the Canadians out of action as much as possible in order to avoid casualties that might lead to a difficult decision on conscription, became obsessed with the fear that the war might end with the Canadians winning no victories on land. As Churchill had described Italy as the &quot;soft underbelly&quot; of the Axis, King believed the up-coming Italian campaign would provide an opportunity for easy victories that would not cause too many casualties, and insisted to the British that a Canadian division had to take part in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, saying the Canadian people would be unhappy with him if the war ended with only battles for Canada being Hong Kong and Dieppe. Despite King&#x27;s crass political motives for wanting the Canadians to take part in Husky, the British agreed to accommodate him. McNaughton was opposed at first to losing a division, saying he was opposed to sending the 1st Division to Sicily &quot;merely to satisfy a desire for activity&quot;. In June 1943, McNaughton very reluctantly approved of the decision to detach the 1st Canadian Division from the First Canadian Army, which was to take part in Operation Husky as part of the British Eighth Army commanded by General Bernard Montgomery. McNaughton was concerned about losing a division, but was promised that 1st Division would return to Britain to rejoin First Canadian Army when Husky was completed, and the possibility of finally getting the 1st Division into action, which had been assigned to Britain in late 1939, was too much to resist. Operation Husky began on 9 July 1943, and McNaughton complained much when the initial press releases announcing the invasion did not mention the Canadians were taking part. When McNaughton tried to visit Sicily to observe the 1st Division in action, Montgomery refused, saying the 1st Canadian Division was operating as part of his Eighth Army and he not want McNaughton interfering with his operations. General Guy Simonds commanding the 1st Division supported Montgomery as he felt McNaughton would do more than &quot;observe&quot; his operations and it would be impossible for him to serve two commanders at once. McNaughton complained furiously about his exclusion from Sicily, saying that as the senior Canadian general in Europe that he had the right to visit Canadian troops wherever they were in Europe. The British found the Canadian nationalist McNaughton a &quot;prickly&quot; man to deal with, as McNaughton saw Canada as an equal power and not as a subordinate nation.

In September 1943, McNaughton clashed with Mackenzie King, when the Prime Minister decided that the 1st Canadian Division would stay with the British Eighth Army as it crossed over to the Italian mainland, and that he would send the 5th Canadian Armored Division and 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade and the headquarters for I Canadian Corps to Italy as well. In a memo to Defence Minister James Ralston, McNaughton wrote: &quot;The important thing for Canada at the end of the war is to have her army together under the control of a Canadian&quot;. However, the prospect of the Canadians fighting in the &quot;soft underbelly&quot; of Italy, which King mistakenly believed would not involve too many losses and allowed the Canadians to win battlefield glory, was too attractive to King. McNaughton for his part, believed that all of the Canadian units in Europe should operate together as part of the First Canadian Army was incensed about losing an entire corps to the Eighth Army, and did little to disguise his fury that the Canadians would operate in both Italy and in north-west Europe when Operation Overlord was launched. McNaughton wrote the &quot;dispersion of the Army&quot; by taking away 1st Corps from his command would be bad for morale, and in a memo to Ralston suggested &quot;it would be wise to put someone in control who believed in it [dispersion]&quot;. A further strain in relations with Ralston occurred when the Defence Minister passed along Brooke&#x27;s opinion that McNaughton was unfit for field command, a judgement that deeply wounded McNaughton&#x27;s ego. McNaughton believed that Ralston was responsible for Brooke&#x27;s views, leading to the exchange of increasingly acrimonious telegrams between Ralston and McNaughton with the latter accusing the former of seeking to undermine his command.

A favourite of Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister; though in October 1943 he came back from a weekend at Chequers looking limp and told Brooke that he had &quot;had a ghastly weekend ... kept up all hours of the morning.&quot; Brooke had warned him that Churchill might want him to agree to an operation against Norway (which had twice been turned down as impractical). While he had eventually agreed to &quot;examine the Trondheim operation&quot;, to Brooke&#x27;s relief he had since sent a telegram to Mackenzie King that he was &quot;on no account to agree to the employment of the Canadian forces in any operations in Norway&quot;.

He was sent as envoy for a conference with Stalin. McNaughton, then a Major-General, was cover celebrity for &quot;Life&quot; magazine in December 1939 when Canada had entered the war, but the USA had not. His support for voluntary enlistment rather than conscription led to conflict with James Ralston, the then Minister of National Defence. McNaughton had taken the loss of I Canadian Corps to the Eighth Army very badly, leading to strained relations with Ralston while the British and Montgomery in particular made it clear that they did not want the First Canadian Army going into Operation Overlord, the invasion of France, under McNaugton&#x27;s command. In December 1943, McNaughton was removed as commander of the First Canadian Army and the historian Desmond Morton wrote: &quot;By the end of December, a fit and lively looking McNaughton returned to Canada, recalled on &quot;on grounds of health&quot;. His successor, after a brief interlude, commanding the Canadian Corps in Italy, was Lieutenant-General Harry Crerar&quot;.

==Minister of National Defence==
Because of his support for a volunteer army, McNaughton, now a full general, remained friendly with Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, who wanted to make him the first Canadian-born Governor General of Canada. Instead, McNaughton became Minister of National Defence when Ralston was forced to resign after the Conscription Crisis of 1944, as King did all he could to avoid introducing conscription. On the morning of 1 November 1944 Mackenzie King in effect fired Ralston as defence minister by accepting his resignation, which had been submitted in April 1942. The fact that McNaughton held anti-conscription views and had he and Ralston hated each other were additional benefits from Mackenzie King&#x27;s viewpoint, but he appointed McNaughton primarily out of the belief that McNaughton by the sheer force of his personality could produce enough volunteers to go overseas and resolve the manpower shortages caused by heavy losses in Italy and north-west Europe.

In his first speech as Defence Minister, McNaughton declared his confidence that &quot;the continuation of the voluntary system will produce the reinforcements&quot;. The Canadian historians Jack Granatstein and Desmond Morton noted: &quot;The news of Ralston&#x27;s sacking put the conscription crisis on the front pages in screaming headlines. To King&#x27;s horror and to McNaughton&#x27;s distress, the publicity created a firestorm of reaction against the once-popular general. Audiences booed and jeered when he tried to rally the country behind the no-conscription policy&quot;.

McNaughton tried to appeal to the &quot;Zombies&quot; (men who had been conscripted for the defence of Canada, so-called because they were soldiers who could not legally fight overseas) to volunteer for Europe, but his speeches failed to move his audiences, who instead booed him. One Zombie was quoted in the press as saying: &quot;If Mackenzie King wants me to go overseas, he&#x27;ll have to send me. I&#x27;m damned if I&#x27;ll volunteer to help out this government&quot;. On the morning of 22 November 1944, General John Carl Murchie told McNaughton about the failure of his policy and that virtually no Zombies had volunteered to &quot;go active&quot;, which McNaughton recalled &quot;was like a blow to the stomach&quot;. Later on 22 November 1944, McNaughton telephoned King to say as the prime minister wrote in his diary: &quot;The Headquarters staff here had all advised him that the voluntary system would not get the men...It was the most serious advice that could be tended&quot;. Mackenzie King chose to wildly misrepresent McNaughton&#x27;s statement as some sort of military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, what in his own words was variously a &quot;generals&#x27; revolt&quot;, a &quot;palace revolution&quot; and &quot;the surrender of civil government to the military&quot; as he now announced that because of the alleged &quot;generals&#x27; revolt&quot; that he was being forced against his will to send some 17,000 &quot;Zombies&quot; to the battlefields of Europe.

McNaughton was soon pressured into calling for conscription despite King&#x27;s wishes, a popular move for some Canadians but an equally unpopular one for many others. As McNaughton was never elected to the House of Commons, on 22 November 1944, he had to go to the bar of the House of Commons to announce that some 17,000 Zombies were to go overseas if the House gave its approval. When word of the decision reached the &quot;Zombie&quot; soldiers stationed in Terrace, British Columbia who had guarding the Pacific coast against the unlikely event of a Japanese invasion, it resulted in the short-lived Terrace Mutiny. The mutiny was soon put down peacefully by General George Pearkes of the Pacific command who went to Terrace and advised the mutineers that the penalty for mutiny was death, but if they agreed to lay down their arms, no charges of mutiny would be pressed.

In early 1945, McNaughton sought election to the House of Commons as a Liberal in a by-election in the Ontario riding of Grey North. During the 1945 by-election, the Conservative candidate W. Garfield Case made much of the Catholicism of McNaughton&#x27;s wife, claiming that the general was under the control of Mrs. McNaughton, whom in turn was taking her orders from the Pope. McNaughton&#x27;s opposition to conscription was portrayed as a part of a Catholic plot to destroy the British and Protestant character of Canada by having only volunteers go overseas (who were very inaccurately portrayed as being only Protestant English-Canadians) where many would be killed while Catholics remained at home to &quot;breed and breed&quot;. A Protestant fundamentalist minister, the Baptist Revered Thomas Todhunter Shields, who campaigned aggressively against McNaughton, warned in a speech in Owen Sound that &quot;a vote for McNaughton is a vote for the Roman Catholic hierarchy and for the future enslavement of Canada&quot;. Shields portrayed Mrs. McNaughton as a sinister and malign influence on her husband, a charge that infuriated McNaughton who was furious that his wife should become the central issue in the by-election. Case in a speech stated that it was wrong for the &quot;most British riding in Canada&quot; to vote for McNaughton, whom he accused of pandering to Quebec, a province that was &quot;lacking in courage, loyalty and resolve, a community which has deteriorated till we find them paying tribute to those who would hamper the war effort&quot;.

The decision to send only 17,000 Zombies (who were widely, if wrongly perceived to be mostly French-Canadian Catholics) to Europe was portrayed as a disaster with the claim being made in a speech by the Conservative leader John Bracken that most of the 17,000 had either deserted or thrown their rifles away, which was used to illustrate McNaughton&#x27;s alleged weakness as a defence minister as he supposedly given orders not to prosecute the deserters. John Diefenbaker, a Conservative MP from Saskatchewan arrived in Grey North to campaign for Case, giving speeches where he claimed that Quebec was the province of deserters while Ontario was the province of volunteers and like Bracken claimed that McNaughton was a weak defence minister who was pandering to Quebec by his alleged order not to prosecute the thousands of Zombies who were said to have deserted since November. The fact that the Conservative leader Bracken personally campaigned in Grey North together with rising Conservative stars like Diefenbaker was a further advantage for Case while Mackenzie King and other prominent Liberals did not campaign for McNaughton.

The by-election of 5 February 1945 ended with McNaughton&#x27;s defeat to Case, who was elected the MP for Grey North. McNaughton always believed that it was the issue of his wife&#x27;s Catholicism that caused his defeat in the Grey North riding, and that Mackenzie King had set up him for the defeat by having run for the House of Commons in a riding that was mostly rural and Protestant, instead of an urban riding where population was more diverse. The journalist John Marshall described Grey North as &quot;typically Old Ontario&quot; area that was rural, ardently Protestant and very committed to upholding the British connection, which led him to wonder why Mackenzie King had chosen to have McNaughton run in Grey North at all. Another journalist, Wilfried Eggleston, reported that had Mrs. McNaughton been a Protestant, the general would almost certainly had won the Grey North by-election, writing that this was &quot;a deplorable factor in a country like Canada, but nobody denies that it is influential&quot;.

In the 1945 federal election, McNaughton ran again as a Liberal in the riding of Qu&#x27;Appelle, Saskatchewan, and was again defeated. McNaughton resigned as Defence minister in August 1945. King had made him take blame for conscription, to which both men had been opposed, and now had to replace him as Governor-General designate. King recommended to King George VI that the British Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander be appointed Governor-General of Canada, setting back the first appointment of a Canadian to that role by seven more years.

The McNaughton Avenue was named in Ottawa, Ontario, and unveiled and dedicated to General Andrew McNaughton in 1943. The avenue runs from McGillivray Street to Main Street.

==After the war==


After the war McNaughton chaired the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission from 1946 to 1948; served as Canada&#x27;s Ambassador to the United Nations from 1948 to 1949; and chaired the Canadian Section of the International Joint Commission from 1950 to 1962.

His son, Brigadier-General Edward Murray Dalziel Leslie (né McNaughton) was commander of 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery and served during the Korean War.

His grandson Lieutenant-General Andrew Leslie was Chief of the Land Staff of the Canadian Forces from 2006 to 2010.

<doc id="405361" wikidata="Q926333" url="?curid=405361" title="Fourth Estate">
<text>The term Fourth Estate or fourth power refers to the press and news media in their explicit capacity, beyond the reporting of news, of wielding influence in politics. The derivation of the term arises from the traditional European concept of the three estates of the realm: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners.

The equivalent term &quot;fourth power&quot; is somewhat uncommon in English, but it is used in many European languages, including German (&quot;Vierte Gewalt&quot;), Italian (&quot;quarto potere&quot;), Spanish (&quot;Cuarto poder&quot;), French (&quot;Quatrième pouvoir&quot;), Swedish (&quot;tredje statsmakten [Third Estate]&quot;), Polish (Czwarta Władza), and Russian (&quot;четвёртая власть&quot;) to refer to a government&#x27;s separation of powers into legislative, executive, and judicial branches.

The expression has also been applied to lawyers, to the British Queen Consort (acting as a free agent independent of her husband), and to the proletariat. But, generally, the term &quot;Fourth Estate&quot; refers to the press and media, emphasizing its role in monitoring and influencing the other branches of government and society.

A Fifth Estate, while not recognized in the same way as the first four, includes bloggers, social media influencers, and other online platforms that can influence public discourse and politics independently of traditional media.

==Etymology==
Oxford English Dictionary attributes, (&quot;without confirmation&quot;) the origin of the term to Edmund Burke, who may have used it in a British parliamentary debate of 19–20 February 1771, on the opening up of press reporting of the House of Commons of Great Britain. Historian Thomas Carlyle reported the phrase in his account of the night&#x27;s proceedings, published in 1840, attributing it to Burke.

==The press==
In modern use, the term is applied to the press, with the earliest use in this sense described by Thomas Carlyle in his book &quot;&quot; (1840): &quot;Burke said there were Three Estates in Parliament; but, in the Reporters&#x27; Gallery yonder, there sat a Fourth Estate more important far than they all.&quot; (The three estates of the parliament of Britain were: the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal and the Commons.) If Burke made the statement Carlyle associates with him, Carlyle may have had the remark in mind when he wrote in his &quot;French Revolution&quot; (1837) that &quot;A Fourth Estate, of Able Editors, springs up; increases and multiplies, irrepressible, incalculable.&quot; In France the three estates of the French States-General were: the church, the nobility and enfranchised townsmen.
Carlyle, however, may have mistaken his attribution: Thomas Macknight, writing in 1858, observes that Burke was merely a teller at the &quot;illustrious nativity of the Fourth Estate&quot;. If Burke is excluded, other candidates for coining the term are Henry Brougham speaking in Parliament in 1823 or 1824 and Thomas Macaulay in an essay of 1828 reviewing &quot;Hallam&#x27;s Constitutional History&quot;: &quot;The gallery in which the reporters sit has become a fourth estate of the realm.&quot; In 1821, William Hazlitt applied the term to an individual journalist, William Cobbett, and the phrase soon became well established.

In 1891, Oscar Wilde wrote:

In United States English, the phrase &quot;fourth estate&quot; is contrasted with the &quot;fourth branch of government&quot;, a term that originated because no direct equivalents to the estates of the realm exist in the United States. The &quot;fourth estate&quot; is used to emphasize the independence of the press, while the &quot;fourth branch&quot; suggests that the press is not independent of the government.

===The networked Fourth Estate===
Yochai Benkler, author of the 2006 book &quot;The Wealth of Networks&quot;, described the &quot;Networked Fourth Estate&quot; in a May 2011 paper published in the &quot;Harvard Civil Liberties Review&quot;. He explains the growth of non-traditional journalistic media on the Internet and how it affects the traditional press using WikiLeaks as an example. When Benkler was asked to testify in the &quot;United States vs. PFC Bradley E. Manning&quot; trial, in his statement to the morning 10 July 2013 session of the trial he described the Networked Fourth Estate as the set of practices, organizing models, and technologies that are associated with the free press and provide a public check on the branches of government. 

It differs from the traditional press and the traditional fourth estate in that it has a diverse set of actors instead of a small number of major presses. These actors include small for-profit media organizations, non-profit media organizations, academic centers, and distributed networks of individuals participating in the media process with the larger traditional organizations.

==Alternative meanings==

===Lawyers===
In 1580 Michel de Montaigne proposed that governments should hold in check a &quot;fourth estate&quot; of lawyers selling justice to the rich and denying it to rightful litigants who do not bribe their way to a verdict:
Michel de Montaigne, in the translation by John Florio, 1603.

===The proletariat===
An early citation for this is Henry Fielding in &quot;The Covent Garden Journal&quot; (1752):
This sense has prevailed in other countries: In Italy, for example, striking workers in 1890s Turin were depicted as —The Fourth Estate—in a painting by Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo. A political journal of the left, &quot;Quarto Stato&quot;, published in Milan, Italy, in 1926, also reflected this meaning. 

In response to violence against a textile worker demonstration in Fourmies, France on May Day 1891, Georges Clemenceau said in a speech to the Chamber of Deputies:

Traditionalist philosopher Julius Evola saw the Fourth Estate as the final point of his historical cycle theory, the regression of the castes: 
===British queens consort===
In a parliamentary debate of 1789 Thomas Powys, 1st Baron Lilford, MP, demanded of minister William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham that he should not allow powers of regency to &quot;a fourth estate: the queen&quot;. This was reported by Burke, who, as noted above, went on to use the phrase with the meaning of &quot;press&quot;.

=== U.S. Department of Defense ===
In the United States government&#x27;s Department of Defense, the &quot;fourth estate&quot; (also called the &quot;back office&quot;) refers to 28 agencies that do not fall under the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Examples include the Defense Technology Security Administration, Defense Technical Information Center, and Defense Information Systems Agency.

==Fiction==

In his novel &quot;The Fourth Estate&quot;, Jeffrey Archer wrote: &quot;In May 1789, Louis XVI summoned to Versailles a full meeting of the &#x27;Estates General&#x27;. The First Estate consisted of three hundred clergy. The Second Estate, three hundred nobles. The Third Estate, commoners.&quot; The book is fiction based on the lives of two real-life press barons, Robert Maxwell and Rupert Murdoch.

<text>The office of the future is a collection of ideas for redesigning the office. As technology and society have evolved, the definition of the office of the future has changed. Current concepts, dating from the 1940s, are now known as the &quot;paperless office&quot;.

==History==
In a 1920 advertisement, Art Metal company boasted of its contribution to the office of the future—steel office equipment.
In a 1928 advertisement for typewriters, Remington Rand described &quot;the business office of the future&quot;, using its &quot;Quiet Typewriter&quot;, as quiet, open, scientifically arranged, and efficient.
In 1935, the Marquette Building in Chicago created a model office of the future to show prospective tenants. This featured high-intensity lighting, &quot;color...to give the impression of great roominess&quot;, an &quot;efficient&quot; layout. 
The Johnson Wax Headquarters, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and completed in 1939, featured &quot;many advanced structural, lighting, heating and equipment ideas. A follow-up article touted the productivity improvement due to air-conditioning. On &quot;the hottest day of July&quot; the reporter found &quot;work there proceeding in air-conditioned comfort with no apparent let-down of any kind,&quot; as opposed to other offices visited the same day, which experienced a 40-50% let-down.

The first practical modern office of the future concept was probably the series of machines which were presented in &quot;Life&quot; magazine in September 1945. &quot;Life&quot; magazine hired an illustrator from Sperry Rand, Alfred D. Crimi, to make drawings of the concepts Vannevar Bush had presented a few months earlier in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; magazine under the title &quot;As We May Think.&quot;

The Memex article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; is most often cited because of its longer text which details the proposal of a system of shared microfilm based hyperlinks which could be considered as a precursor to the World Wide Web. &quot;Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them.&quot; Those citations tend to overlook the massive organization it would have taken to mail all those microfilm reels between scientists, and eventually between any knowledge worker, in order to make the system work. The citations also tend to overlook that Memex was an entire system, composed not only of a massive desk which housed the microfilm hyperlinking equipment, and the microfilm library but also of a speech activated typewriter (also capable of speech synthesis from normal paper text) and other accessories. Also overlooked is the difficulty of making large volumes of printed material readable by machine through optical character recognition.

Bush&#x27;s predictions are notable for the fact that many have now become reality: the wearable camera (&quot;Cyclops&quot;), xerography (&quot;dry photography&quot;), speech-to-text (&quot;vocoder&quot;), and computers (&quot;thinking machines&quot;). Only microfilm has become obsolete, and the desk-size &quot;Memex&quot; is now a device as small as a smart phone or tablet.

Many concepts for future computer systems were presented in the 1960s and 1970s, but none really touched office work as much as the Memex or had such a lasting impact. 

==Xerox==
In 1970, under Chairman Joseph C. Wilson, Xerox founded the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) to conduct basic research and develop the technologies for the office of the future. Among other advances, PARC developed the first personal computer, the Alto in 1970, the first tablet computer, Alan Kay&#x27;s Dynabook in 1972, and the first laser printer in 1973. &quot;The Alto was a wild departure from the computers that preceded it. It was built to tuck under a desk, with its monitor, keyboard, and mouse on top. It was totally interactive, responding directly to its single user.&quot;

&quot;Despite [the Alto&#x27;s] age, using it feels so familiar and natural that it’s sometimes difficult to appreciate just how extraordinary, how different it was when it first appeared.&quot; The user can interact with the computer by pointing and clicking with a mouse and typing on a keyboard. ... [U]sing a word processor with the core features and functions of Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice’s Writer, along with an email client that could be mistaken for a simplified version of Apple Mail, Microsoft Outlook, or Mozilla Thunderbird... Its networking capabilities can link me to other computers and to high-quality laser printers.&quot; &quot;[T]he Alto came to shape our lives with computers a half century later.&quot;
In 1977, Xerox introduced the Alto to the world at the &quot;Xerox World Conference&quot; in Boca Raton. At that point, Xerox was already running some 400 Altos internally. Bob Taylor, head of PARC&#x27;s Computer Science Laboratory demonstrated the machine that he believed &quot;would be transformational, eliminating much of what he called the &#x27;drudgery of office work&#x27; and freeing office workers “to attend to higher-level functions.&quot;

In 1981, Xerox introduced the Xerox 8010 Information System (Xerox Star), in an attempt to capitalize on the Alto&#x27;s technology. The Star was originally sold as part of an integrated Xerox &quot;personal office system&quot; that also connected to other workstations and network services via Ethernet. Possibly because of its high price, and the high buy-in cost of a complete office system, the Star was not a commercial success.
the Dynabook idea (presented by Alan Kay and the Xerox PARC) proposed a portable slate-like personal computer which could have been used in an office but which was really an extremely personal exploration tool, meant more to draw art, compose music or invent new algorithms than to write a business letter. The tablet idea was slower to catch on, and the popular Apple iPad was only introduced nearly forty years later, in 2010.

==Starfire video prototype==
Sun Microsystems presented a complete office of the future concept when it made its Starfire video prototype public in 1994. Like the Memex system, The Starfire prototype has been sometimes touted as predicting the birth of the World Wide Web. While it is true that we see the heroine &quot;navigating&quot; what the narrator describes as a &quot;vast information space&quot; this takes up but a few seconds at the beginning of the 15 minute Starfire video.

The Starfire is much more than a Web navigating machine. The Starfire video shows in the rest of the 15 minutes a large panoply of hardware and software concepts such as a gestural interface, total integration with public telephony and other innovations. Like the Memex system the Starfire has a large, massive desk as its central feature, and proposes compatible devices in complement to the desk, such as a laptop with a chorded keyboard and advanced videoconferencing. Bruce Tognazzini was the principal driver behind the project, with the collaboration of many other Sun alumni including Jakob Nielsen, and the help of external consultants.

==Microsoft and IBM prototypes==
The two most recent integrated visions of the digital office of the future have come from Microsoft and IBM. In a way they are in interesting opposition. The D# screen and its Broadbench software look like an informatician&#x27;s dream workspace, betraying the computer science or software developer culture prevalent at Microsoft. The Bluespace prototype seems like the perfect environment for an ambitious young IBM salesperson, thus betraying the salesperson-centric culture prevalent within IBM.

The D#-Broadbench curves around a single user, making physically close collaborative work difficult. The gentle curve helps to enhance concentration, while its massive size makes it unsuitable for the typical cubicle and perfect for a small closed office, like the one each and every software developer has at Microsoft.

The Bluespace prototype is filled with enhancements meant to manage and control the flow of disturbances coming to a user but not to completely stop them or discourage them in any definitive way. All of the elements are small enough to fit into a typical cubicle or even a smaller one than the norm. While the screens and other devices surround the user, they are flexible enough to permit physical teamwork between two or three more other users coming into the cubicle.

Both prototypes require considerable work to be adapted to what most managers or professionals consider a &quot;real&quot; desk, that is a pedestal desk, located in a closed office. They would also require rework and re-think to be adapted to the types of desks which are found in home offices or small business offices, such as the armoire desk.

Teams at IBM Research and Microsoft Research are currently working on perfecting these prototypes.

==Art and beauty==
At the beginning of the year 2001 the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York city presented a 3 month long exhibit called &quot;Workspheres&quot;, which explored the role of industrial designers in creating what were intended to be effective and aesthetic solutions to present and future office environment issues.

Among the 151 objects or ensembles presented there were 6 works commissioned specifically for the exhibition, from experienced industrial design companies like IDEO. While some of the works had practical aspects, they were all chosen for their artistic impact. A complete catalogue of the exhibition was produced and a special website, with its own distinctive artistic interface, was put on line.

&quot;Office of the Future&quot; is also the name of an ongoing research project (based at the Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) which began among a consortium of universities sponsored by the National Science Foundation.

<text>Gadus is a genus of demersal fish in the family Gadidae, commonly known as cod, although there are additional cod species in other genera. The best known member of the genus is the Atlantic cod.

==Species==
Today, three species in the genus are recognized:

Modern taxonomy included Alaska pollock (&quot;Gadus chalcogrammus&quot;), which is genetically not separate from Norway pollock. Greenland cod (&quot;G. ogac&quot;) that was considered an own species, is considered the same species as Pacific cod (&quot;G. macrocephalus&quot;).

<doc id="405370" wikidata="Q774682" url="?curid=405370" title="Republic Pictures">
<text>Republic Pictures is currently an acquisition-only label owned by Paramount Pictures. Its history dates back to Republic Pictures Corporation, an American film studio that originally operated from 1935 to 1967, based in Los Angeles, California. It had production and distribution facilities in Studio City, as well as a movie ranch in Encino.

Republic was known for specializing in Westerns, cliffhanger serials, and B-films emphasizing action and mystery. The studio was also notable for developing the careers of such famous Western stars as Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and John Wayne. It was also responsible for the financial management and distribution of several big-budget feature films directed by John Ford, as well as one Shakespeare motion picture directed by Orson Welles. 

Under the supervising leadership of Herbert J. Yates, Republic was considered a mini-major film studio, producing almost 1,000 motion pictures.

==History==
=== As movie studio ===
Created in 1935 by Herbert J. Yates, a longtime investor in film (having invested in 20th Century Pictures at its founding in 1933) and owner of the film processing laboratory Consolidated Film Industries, Republic was initially founded upon Yates&#x27; acquisition of six smaller independent Poverty Row studios.

In the depths of the Great Depression, Yates&#x27; laboratory was no longer serving the major studios, which had developed their own in-house laboratories for purposes of both economy and control, while the small, independent producers were going under in the face of increased competition from the majors combined with the general impact of the depressed economy. In 1935, he thus decided to create a studio of his own to insure Consolidated&#x27;s stability. Six surviving small companies (Monogram Pictures, Mascot Pictures, Liberty Pictures, Majestic Pictures, Chesterfield Pictures, (and Invincible Pictures)) were all in debt to Yates&#x27; lab. He prevailed upon these studios to merge under his leadership or else face foreclosure on their outstanding lab bills. Yates&#x27; new company, Republic Pictures Corporation, was presented to their producer-owners as a collaborative enterprise focused on low-budget product.

* The largest of Republic&#x27;s components was Monogram Pictures, run by producers Trem Carr and W. Ray Johnston, which specialized in &quot;B&quot; films and operated a nationwide distribution system.
* The most technologically advanced of the studios that now comprised Republic was Nat Levine&#x27;s Mascot Pictures Corporation, which had been making serials almost exclusively since the mid-1920s and had a first-class production facility, the former Mack Sennett lot in Studio City. Mascot also had just discovered Gene Autry and signed him to a contract as a singing cowboy star.
* Larry Darmour&#x27;s Majestic Pictures had developed an exhibitor following, with big-name stars and rented sets giving his humble productions a polished look.
* Republic took its original &quot;Liberty Bell&quot; logo from M. H. Hoffman&#x27;s Liberty Pictures (not to be confused with Frank Capra&#x27;s short-lived Liberty Films that produced his &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;) as well as Hoffman&#x27;s talents as a low-budget film producer.
* Chesterfield Pictures and Invincible Pictures, two sister companies under the same ownership, were skilled in producing low-budget melodramas and mysteries.

Acquiring and integrating these six companies enabled Republic to begin life with an experienced production staff, a company of veteran B-film supporting players and at least one very promising star, a complete distribution system, and a functioning and modern studio. In exchange for merging, the principals were promised independence in their productions under the Republic aegis, and higher budgets with which to improve the quality of the films. After he had learned the basics of film production and distribution from his partners, Yates began asserting more and more authority over their film departments, and dissension arose in the ranks. Carr and Johnston left and reactivated Monogram Pictures in 1937; Darmour resumed independent production for Columbia Pictures; Levine left and never recovered from the loss of his studio, staff and stars, all of whom now were contracted to Republic and Yates. Meanwhile, Yates installed a staff of new, &quot;associate&quot; producers who were loyal to him. Freed of partners, Yates presided over what was now his film studio and acquiring senior production and management staff who served him as employees, not experienced peers with independent ideas and agendas.

Republic also acquired Brunswick Records for recording sessions with singing cowboys Roy Rogers and Gene Autry. They hired Cy Feuer as head of the studio&#x27;s music department.

At the 1958 annual meeting, Yates announced the end of motion picture production.

===Serials and Television series===
Shut out of their attempts to acquire television broadcasting licenses, most studios resisted making their film libraries available to local stations. Republic, however, established a subsidiary, Hollywood Television Service, in December 1950. Earl Collins, Republic&#x27;s branch manager in Los Angeles, accepted the presidency of the new TV arm. Collins made two major announcements: effective June 25, 1951, much of Republic&#x27;s backlog of feature films would be available to local stations; and, effective that same day, Republic&#x27;s studio lot would be available for rental to independent TV producers. The Republic features, including the Gene Autry and Roy Rogers westerns, were uniformly edited to a running time of 53 minutes and 30 seconds each, in order to fit neatly into one-hour time slots. This was looked upon by TV programmers as a tremendous convenience, and Hollywood Television Service found hundreds of ready customers.

Hollywood Television Service also produced television shows filmed in the same style as Republic&#x27;s serials, such as &quot;The Adventures of Fu Manchu&quot; (1956). Also, in 1952, the Republic studio lot became the first home of MCA&#x27;s series factory, Revue Productions.

While it appeared that Republic was well suited for television series production, it did not have the finances or vision to do so. Yet by the mid-1950s, thanks to its sale of old features and leasing of studio space to MCA, television was the prop supporting Republic. During this period, the studio produced &quot;Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe&quot;; unsuccessful as a theater release, the 12-part serial was later sold to NBC for television distribution.

Talent agent MCA exerted influence at the studio, bringing in some high-paid clients for occasional features, and it was rumored at various times that either MCA or deposed MGM head Louis B. Mayer would buy the studio outright.

As the demand and market for motion pictures declined with the increasing popularity of television, Republic began to cut back on its films, slowing production from 40 features annually in the early 1950s to 18 in 1957 (in 1956—the year the company had recorded a profit of $919,000—it temporarily ceased production of features.) Perhaps inspired by the success of American International Pictures catering to teenaged audiences, Republic dispensed with its old &quot;no exploitation&quot; rule and released several films in the late 1950s about juvenile delinquency, such as &quot;The Wayward Girl&quot; (1957), &quot;Juvenile Jungle&quot; (1958), and &quot;Young and Wild&quot; (1958).

A tearful Yates informed shareholders at the 1958 annual meeting that feature film production was ending; the distribution offices were shut down the following year.

=== As Republic Corporation ===
On July 1, 1958, Victor M. Carter, a Los Angeles businessman and turnaround specialist, acquired controlling interest in the company for nearly $6 million, becoming its president. He turned Republic into a diversified business that included plastics and appliances in addition to its film and studio rentals and Consolidated Film Industries, renaming the company Republic Corporations. In 1963, having used the studio for series production for years, Republic began leasing its backlot to other firms, including CBS. In February 1967, Republic&#x27;s studio was purchased outright by CBS and, having more than quadrupled the stock price for shareholders, Carter sold his controlling interest. Other than producing a 1966 package of 26 Century 66 100-minute made-for-TV movies edited from some of the studio&#x27;s serials to cash in on the popularity of the &quot;Batman&quot; television series, Republic Pictures&#x27; role in Hollywood ended with the sale of the studio lot. Republic sold its library of films to National Telefilm Associates (NTA).

Non-entertainment acquisitions included Mansbach Metal Company and Kentucky Electric Steel Company, both acquired in September 1968. Republic reported a $13 million loss for the year ending October 1970, and a $43 million loss for the year ended July 1971. The company promoted Sanford Sigoloff, who would later earn a reputation as a turnaround expert, to lead as President.

Today, the studio lot is known as CBS Studio Center. In 2006, it became home to the network&#x27;s Los Angeles stations KCBS-TV and KCAL-TV. In 2008, the CBS network relocated from its Hollywood Television City operations to the Radford lot, and its executives are based from the site.

==Film library==
In its early years, Republic was sometimes labeled a &quot;Poverty Row&quot; company, as its primary products were B movies and serials. Most of the technical staff had been with Mascot, a serial specialist, and thus was already geared to the steady production of weekly chapter plays. Republic&#x27;s own serials began in 1936 and developed a following very quickly. Many were live-action adaptations of radio and comic-strip adventures. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1937), starring Ralph Byrd as the intrepid detective, was so popular that it spawned three sequels. &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (1938) and its follow-up &quot;The Lone Ranger Rides Again&quot; (1939) were well received, and &quot;Adventures of Captain Marvel&quot; (1941) reached new heights of visual effects. Serials produced after World War II were more economy-minded, with the running times slashed from 20 minutes per episode to 13 minutes, and with the cliffhanger endings borrowed from older Republic serials and features. The studio also stopped licensing expensive comic-strip and radio properties, and instead created generic cops-and-robbers stories and science-fiction adventures. Despite the obvious economies, the Republic serials still found an audience, the last film being &quot;King of the Carnival&quot; (1955). Republic kept many of its serials in circulation; they were still playing in local movie theaters well into the 1960s.

The backbone of the company was its feature-length Westerns. Many of its Western film leads — among them John Wayne, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Bill Elliott, Allan &quot;Rocky&quot; Lane, and Rex Allen — became recognizable stars at Republic. However, by the mid-1940s, Yates was producing better-quality pictures, mounting big-budget fare such as &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; (1949), &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Maverick Queen&quot; (1956). Another distinguishing aspect of Republic Pictures was Yates&#x27; avoidance of any controversial subject matter (exploitation films being a staple of B movies), in contrast to the other &quot;Poverty Row&quot; studios that often dodged the Production Code.

Republic&#x27;s leading female star was Judy Canova, who was enormously popular in Republic&#x27;s customer base of small towns and rural areas. Republic produced many &quot;hillbilly&quot; rural musicals and comedies featuring Canova and the Weaver Brothers and Elviry. She left Republic after a salary dispute in 1943, but was wooed back into the fold in 1951.

In 1946, Republic incorporated animation into its Gene Autry feature film &quot;Sioux City Sue&quot;. It turned out well enough for the studio to dabble in animated cartoons. After leaving Warner Bros. in 1946 (reportedly because of angering his peers at the studio&#x27;s cartoon division for taking credit that was not really his), Bob Clampett approached Republic and directed a single cartoon, &quot;It&#x27;s a Grand Old Nag&quot;, featuring the equine character Charlie Horse. Republic management, however, had second thoughts owing to dwindling profits and discontinued the series. Clampett took his direction credit under the name &quot;Kilroy&quot;. Republic also released another cartoon series in 1949 (this time without Clampett): a free-wheeling series of animated travelogues called &quot;Jerky Journeys&quot;, written and produced by Leonard Levinson, but only four cartoons were made.

From the mid-1940s, Republic films often featured Vera Hruba Ralston, a former ice skater from Czechoslovakia who had won the heart of Yates, marrying him in 1952. She was originally featured in musicals as Republic&#x27;s answer to Sonja Henie, but Yates tried to build her up as a dramatic star, casting her in leading roles opposite important male stars. Yates billed her as &quot;the most beautiful woman in films&quot;, but her charms were lost on the moviegoing public while her noticeable Czech accent limited her range, and soon exhibitors complained that Republic was producing too many Ralston pictures. Years later, John Wayne admitted that he had departed Republic in 1952 over the prospect of having to appear in yet another film with her. Yates remained Ralston&#x27;s most ardent supporter, and she continued to appear in Republic features until its final production, &quot;Spoilers of the Forest&quot; (1957).

By the mid-to-late-1940s, the American film industry faced an existential threat, the result of years of wartime stress on costs and the postwar exchange and trade restrictions enacted by the nations of Continental Europe (practically closing off the market to smaller studios such as Republic), the Paramount Case (even though Republic never owned more than a handful of theaters), and the rise of television. In 1947, Yates stopped the production of short subjects, reduced the amount of serials, and organized Republic&#x27;s feature output into four types of films: &quot;Jubilee&quot;, usually a Western shot in seven days for about $50,000; &quot;Anniversary&quot;, filmed in 14–15 days for $175,000-$200,000; &quot;Deluxe&quot;, major productions made with a budget of around $500,000; and &quot;Premiere&quot;, which were usually made by top-rank directors who most often did not work for Republic, such as John Ford, Fritz Lang and Frank Borzage, and which could have budgets of $1,000,000 or more. Some of these &quot;Deluxe&quot; films were produced by independent companies and were picked up for release by Republic.

Although Republic released most of its films in black and white, it occasionally produced higher-budgeted films such as &quot;The Red Pony&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; in Technicolor. During the late 1940s and 1950s, Yates utilized a low-cost, two-color process called Trucolor (similar to Cinecolor, favoring blues and oranges) in many Republic films, including &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;, &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1955), and &quot;Magic Fire&quot; (1956). In 1956, the studio devised its own widescreen film process, Naturama, and &quot;The Maverick Queen&quot; was the first film made in that process.

==Re-establishment==
===Republic Entertainment Inc. ===

Following the immense success of their syndication of the Republic Pictures catalogue to cable television, National Telefilm Associates announced on December 28, 1984, that they had acquired the logos, copyrights, and trademarks of Republic Pictures Corporation and effectively renamed themselves as such. A television production unit was set up under the Republic name and offered, among other things, off-network repeats of the CBS series &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and game show &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; in syndication. There were also a few theatrical films, including &quot;Freeway&quot;, &quot;Ruby in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, &quot;Live Nude Girls&quot;, and &quot;Bound&quot;. At the same time, subsidiary NTA Home Entertainment was renamed Republic Pictures Home Video and began remarketing the original Republic film library. In 1985, the company bought out Blackhawk Films, and eventually, Republic decided to close Blackhawk in 1987.

Also that year, Republic Pictures Home Video, the home video division of Republic Pictures, had signed an agreement with Hawk Company, headed by Robert Clouse, in order to gain access to 31 projects that were developed by Hawk, for home video release, and that Republic Pictures Home Video received a 24% share in the newly formed Hawk Company organization. In January 1993, Blockbuster Entertainment announced they would purchase a 35% stake in Republic,

===As a Paramount Global subsidiary===
On March 24, 2023, Paramount Global announced it would revive the Republic Pictures brand, with the intention of it serving as the company&#x27;s acquisitions label, releasing titles acquired by Paramount Global Content Distribution, similar to the distribution model of, amongst other companies, Stage 6 Films or American International Pictures.

<doc id="405374" wikidata="Q39619" url="?curid=405374" title="Ali">
<text>Ali ibn Abi Talib (; ) was the cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and was the fourth Rashidun caliph who ruled from to 661, as well as the first Shia imam. Born to Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Fatima bint Asad, young Ali was raised by his elder cousin Muhammad and was among the first to accept his teachings.

Ali played a pivotal role in the early years of Islam when Muslims were severely persecuted in Mecca. After immigration () to Medina in 622, Muhammad gave his daughter Fatima to Ali in marriage and swore a pact of brotherhood with him. Ali served as Muhammad&#x27;s secretary and deputy in this period, and was the flag bearer of his army. Numerous sayings of Muhammad praise Ali, the most controversial of which was uttered in 632 at the Ghadir Khumm, &quot;Whoever I am his , this Ali is his .&quot; The interpretation of the polysemous Arabic word is disputed: For Shia Muslims, Muhammad thus invested Ali with his religious and political authority, while Sunni Muslims view this as a mere statement of friendship and rapport. When Muhammad died in the same year, a group of Muslims met in the absence of Ali and appointed Abu Bakr () as their leader. Ali later relinquished his claims to leadership and resigned from public life during the reigns of Abu Bakr and his successor, Umar (). Even though his advice was occasionally sought, the conflicts between Ali and the first two caliphs are epitomized by his refusal to follow their practices. This refusal cost Ali the caliphate to the benefit of Uthman (), who was thus appointed to succeed Umar by the electoral council. Ali was also highly critical of Uthman, who was widely accused of nepotism and corruption. Yet Ali also repeatedly mediated between the caliph and the provincial dissidents angered by his policies.

Following Uthman&#x27;s assassination in June 656, Ali was elected caliph in Medina. He immediately faced two separate rebellions, both ostensibly to avenge Uthman: The triumvirate of Talha, Zubayr, both companions of Muhammad, and his widow Aisha captured Basra in Iraq but were defeated by Ali in the Battle of the Camel in 656. Elsewhere, Mu&#x27;awiya, whom Ali had just removed from the governorship of Syria, fought against Ali the inconclusive Battle of Siffin in 657, which ended in a failed arbitration process that alienated some of Ali&#x27;s supporters. These formed the Kharijites, who later terrorized the public and were crushed by Ali in the Battle of Nahrawan in 658. Ali was assassinated in 661 by the Kharijite dissident Ibn Muljam, which paved the way for Mu&#x27;awiya to seize power and found the dynastic Umayyad Caliphate.

Ali is revered for his courage, honesty, unbending devotion to Islam, magnanimity, and equal treatment of all Muslims. For his admirers, he has thus become the archetype of uncorrupted Islam and pre-Islamic chivalry. Sunni Muslims regard him as the last of the () caliphs, while Shia Muslims venerate him as their first imam, that is, the rightful religious and political successor to Muhammad. Ali&#x27;s place is said to be second only to Muhammad in Shia Muslim culture. The shrine of Ali in Najaf, Iraq, is a major destination for Shia pilgrimage. The legacy of Ali is collected and studied in numerous books, the most famous of which is .

==Birth and early life==
Ali was born in Mecca to Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib and his wife Fatima bint Asad around 600 CE. His date of birth is possibly 13 Rajab, which is the occasion celebrated annually by Shia Muslims. Ali may have been the only person born inside the Ka&#x27;ba, the holiest site of Islam, which is located in Mecca. Ali&#x27;s father was a leading member of the Banu Hashim, a clan within the Meccan tribe of Quraysh. Abu Talib also raised his nephew Muhammad after his parents died. Later, when Abu Talib fell into poverty, Ali was taken in at the age of about five and raised by Muhammad and his wife Khadija.

Aged about eleven, Ali was among the first to accept Muhammad&#x27;s teachings and profess Islam. Ali did so either after Khadija or after Khadija and Muhammad&#x27;s successor, Abu Bakr. While, the precise order here is debated among Shia and Sunni scholars, the earliest sources place Ali before Abu Bakr. Muhammad&#x27;s call to Islam in Mecca lasted from 610 to 622, during which Ali assiduously supported the small Muslim community, especially the poor. Some three years after his first revelation, Muhammad gathered his relatives for a feast, invited them to Islam, and asked for their assistance. Aged about fourteen, Ali was the only relative there who offered his support, after which Muhammad told his guests that Ali was his brother and his successor, according to the Sunni historian al-Tabari (). The Shia interpretation of this episode is that Muhammad had already designated Ali as his successor.

== Companionship of Muhammad ==
When tipped off about an assassination plot in 622, Muhammad escaped to Yathrib, now known as Medina, but Ali stayed behind as his decoy. That Ali risked his life for Muhammad is said to be the reason for the revelation of the Quranic passage, &quot;But there is also a kind of man who gives his life away to please God.&quot; This emigration marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar (AH). Ali too escaped Mecca after returning the goods entrusted to Muhammad there. Later in Medina, Muhammad selected Ali as his brother when he paired Muslims for fraternity pacts. Around 623–625, Muhammad gave his daughter Fatima to Ali in marriage, aged about twenty-two at the time. Muhammad had earlier turned down marriage proposals for Fatima by some of his companions, notably, Abu Bakr and Umar.

===Event of the ===

A Christian envoy from Najran, located in South Arabia, arrived in Medina circa 632 and negotiated a peace treaty with Muhammad. The envoy also debated with Muhammad the nature of Jesus, human or divine. Linked to this episode is verse 3:61 of the Quran, which instructs Muhammad to challenge his opponents to (), perhaps when their debate had reached a deadlock. Even though the delegation ultimately withdrew from the challenge, Muhammad appeared for the occasion of , accompanied by Ali, his wife Fatima, and their two sons, Hasan and Husayn. The inclusion of these four by Muhammad in the ritual, as his witnesses and guarantors, likely raised their religious rank within the community. If the word &#x27;ourselves&#x27; in the verse is a reference to Ali and Muhammad, as Shia authors argue, then the former naturally enjoys a similar religious authority in the Quran as the latter.

===Political career===
In Medina, Ali acted as Muhammad&#x27;s secretary and deputy. He was also one of the scribes tasked with committing the Quran to writing. In 628, Ali wrote down the terms of the Treaty of al-Hudaybiya, the peace treaty between Muslims and Meccan pagans. In 630, divine orders pushed Muhammad to replace Abu Bakr with Ali for a key Quranic announcement in Mecca, according to the canonical Sunni source . Ali also helped ensure that the Conquest of Mecca in 630 was bloodless and later destroyed the idols housed in Ka&#x27;ba. In 631, Ali was sent to preach Islam in Yemen, as a consequence of which the Hamdanids peacefully converted. Ali also peacefully resolved a blood feud between Muslims and the Banu Jadhima.

===Military career===

Ali accompanied Muhammad in all of his military missions except the Expedition of Tabuk in 630, during which Ali was left behind in charge of Medina. The hadith of the position is linked to this occasion, &quot;Are you not content, Ali, to stand to me as Aaron stood to Moses, except that there will be no prophet after me?&quot; This statement appears in the canonical Sunni sources and , among others. For the Shia, this hadith signifies Ali&#x27;s usurped right to succeed Muhammad. In the absence of Muhammad, Ali commanded the expedition to Fadak in 628.

Ali was renowned for his bravery on the battlefield, and for his magnanimity towards his defeated enemies. He was the standard-bearer in the Battle of Badr (624) and the Battle of Khaybar (628). He vigorously defended Muhammad in the Battle of Uhud (625) and the Battle of Hunayn (630), and Muslims&#x27; victory in the Battle of Khaybar has been attributed to his courage, where he is said to have torn off the iron gate of the enemy fort. Ali also defeated the pagan champion Amr ibn Abd Wudd in the Battle of the Trench in 627. According to al-Tabari, Muhammad reported hearing a divine voice at Uhud, &quot;[There is] no sword but Zulfiqar [Ali&#x27;s sword], [there is] no chivalrous youth () but Ali.&quot; Ali and another companion, Zubayr, apparently oversaw the killing of the Banu Qurayza men for treachery in 626627, though the historicity of this account has been doubted.

===Ghadir Khumm===

On his return trip from the Hajj pilgrimage in 632, Muhammad halted the large caravan of pilgrims at the Ghadir Khumm and addressed them after the congregational prayer. After the prayer, Muhammad delivered a sermon to a large number of Muslims in which he emphasized the importance of the Quran and his (, his family). Taking Ali by the hand, Muhammad then asked if he was not () the believers than themselves, this is evidently a reference to verse 33:6 of the Quran. When they affirmed, Muhammad then declared, &quot;He whose I am, Ali is his .&quot; , a canonical Sunni source, adds that Muhammad repeated this statement three or four more times and that Umar congratulated Ali after the sermon, &quot;You have now become the of every faithful man and woman.&quot; Muhammad had earlier alerted Muslims about his impending death. Shia sources describe the event in greater detail, linking the announcement to verses 5:3 and 5:67 of the Quran.

The authenticity of the Ghadir Khumm is rarely contested, as its &quot;among the most extensively acknowledged and substantiated&quot; reports in classical Islamic sources. However, &#x27; is a polysemous Arabic word and its interpretation in the context of the Ghadir Khumm is split along sectarian lines. Shia sources interpret &#x27; as &#x27;leader&#x27;, &#x27;master&#x27;, and &#x27;patron&#x27;, while Sunni sources interpret it as love or support for Ali. Shias, therefore, view the Ghadir Khumm as the investiture of Ali with Muhammad&#x27;s religious and political authority, while Sunnis regard it as a statement about the rapport between the two men, or that Ali should execute Muhammad&#x27;s will. Shias point to the extraordinary nature of the announcement, give Quranic and textual evidence, and argue to eliminate other meanings of in the hadith except for authority, while Sunnis minimize the importance of the Ghadir Khumm by casting it as a simple response to earlier complaints about Ali. During his caliphate, Ali is known to have asked Muslims to come forward with their testimonies about the Ghadir Khumm, presumably to counter challenges to his legitimacy.

==Life under Rashidun Caliphs==
===Succession to Muhammad===
====Saqifa====
Muhammad died in 632 when Ali was in his early thirties. As he and other close relatives prepared for the burial, a group of the Ansar (Medinan natives, ) gathered at the Saqifa to discuss the future of Muslims or to retake control of their city, Medina. Abu Bakr and Umar were among the few representatives of the Muhajirun (Meccan converts, ) at the Saqifa. The case of Ali was unsuccessfully brought up at the Saqifa in his absence, and, ultimately, those present there appointed Abu Bakr to leadership after a heated debate that is said to have become violent. Clan rivalries at the Saqifa played a key role in favor of Abu Bakr, and the outcome may have been different in a broad council () with Ali as a candidate. In particular, the Quraysh tradition of hereditary succession strongly favored Ali, even though his youth weakened his case. By contrast, the succession (caliphate) of Abu Bakr is often justified on the basis that he led some of the prayers in Muhammad&#x27;s final days, but the veracity and political significance of such reports have been questioned.

===== Attack on Fatima&#x27;s house =====
While the appointment of Abu Bakr was met with little resistance in Medina, the Banu Hashim and some companions of Muhammad soon gathered in protest at Ali&#x27;s house. Among them were Zubayr and Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas. These protestors held Ali to be the rightful successor to Muhammad, probably in reference to the Ghadir Khumm. Among others, al-Tabari reports that Umar then led an armed mob to Ali&#x27;s residence and threatened to set the house on fire if Ali and his supporters did not pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr. The scene soon grew violent, but the mob retreated after Ali&#x27;s wife, Fatima, pleaded with them. Abu Bakr later placed a successful boycott on the Banu Hashim, who eventually abandoned their support for Ali. Most likely, Ali himself did not pledge his allegiance to Abu Bakr until Fatima died within six months of her father, Muhammad. In Shia sources, the death (and miscarriage) of the young Fatima are attributed to an attack on her house to subdue Ali by the order of Abu Bakr. Sunnis categorically reject these reports, but there is evidence in their early sources that a mob entered Fatima&#x27;s house by force and arrested Ali,&quot;&quot; an incident that Abu Bakr regretted on his deathbed. Likely a political move to weaken the Banu Hashim, Abu Bakr had earlier confiscated from Fatima the rich lands of Fadak, which she considered her inheritance (or a gift) from her father. The confiscation of Fadak is often justified in Sunni sources with a hadith about prophetic inheritance, the authenticity of which has been doubted partly because it contradicts Quranic injunctions.

===Caliphate of Abu Bakr (r. 632–634)===
In the absence of popular support, Ali eventually accepted the temporal rule of Abu Bakr, probably for the sake of Muslim unity. In particular, Ali turned down proposals to forcefully pursue the caliphate. He nevertheless viewed himself as the most qualified candidate for leadership by virtue of his merits and his kinship with Muhammad. Evidence suggests that Ali further considered himself as the designated successor of Muhammad. Unlike Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime, Ali retired from public life during the caliphates of Abu Bakr and his successors, Umar and Uthman. Ali did not participate in the Ridda wars and the early Muslim conquests, though he remained an advisor to Abu Bakr and Umar on government and religious matters., However, their conflicts with Ali is also well-documented, but largely ignored in Sunni sources. These tensions were epitomized during the proceedings of the electoral council in 644 when Ali refused to be bound by the precedence of the first two caliphs. In contrast, Shia sources view Ali&#x27;s pledge to Abu Bakr as a (coerced) act of political expediency (). The conflicts with Ali are probably magnified in Shia sources.

===Caliphate of Umar (r. 634–644)===
Before his death in 634, Abu Bakr designated Umar as his successor. Ali was not consulted about this appointment, which was initially resisted by some senior companions. Ali himself did not press any claims this time and kept aloof from public affairs during the caliphate of Umar, who nevertheless consulted Ali in certain matters. For instance, Ali is credited with the idea of adopting the migration to Medina () as the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Yet Ali&#x27;s political advice was probably ignored. For example, Umar devised a state register () to distribute excess state revenues according to Islamic precedence, but Ali held that those revenues should be equally distributed among Muslims, following the practice of Muhammad and Abu Bakr. Ali was also absent from the strategic meeting of notables near Damascus. Ali did not participate in Umar&#x27;s military expeditions, although he does not seem to have publicly objected to them. Umar likely opposed the combination of prophethood and caliphate in the Banu Hashim, and he thus prevented Muhammad from dictating his will on his deathbed, possibly fearing that he might expressly designate Ali as his successor. Nevertheless, perhaps realizing the necessity of Ali&#x27;s cooperation in his collaborative scheme of governance, Umar made some limited overtures to Ali and the Banu Hashim during his caliphate. For instance, Umar returned Muhammad&#x27;s estates in Medina to Ali, but kept Fadak and Khayber. By some accounts, Umar also insisted on marrying Ali&#x27;s daughter Umm Kulthum, to which Ali reluctantly agreed when the former enlisted public support for his demand.

==== Election of Uthman (644) ====

Before his death in 644, Umar tasked a small committee with choosing the next caliph among themselves. Ali and Uthman were the strongest candidates in this committee, whose members were all early companions of Muhammad from the Quraysh tribe. Another member, Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, was given the deciding vote either by the committee or by Umar. After deliberations, Ibn Awf appointed his brother-in-law Uthman as the next caliph, when the latter promised to follow the precedent of the first two caliphs. By contrast, Ali rejected this condition, or gave an evasive answer. The Ansar were not represented in the committee, which was evidently biased toward Uthman. Both of these factors worked against Ali, who could have not been simply excluded from the proceedings.

===Caliphate of Uthman (r. 644–656)===
Uthman was widely accused of nepotism, corruption, and injustice. Ali too criticized Uthman&#x27;s conduct, including his lavish gifts for his kinsmen. Ali also protected outspoken companions, such as Abu Dharr and Ammar, and overall acted as a restraining influence on Uthman. Some supporters of Ali were part of the opposition movement, joined in their efforts by Talha and Zubayr, both senior companions of Muhammad, and by his widow Aisha. Among such supporters of Ali were Malik al-Ashtar and other religiously learned (). These supporters wanted to see Ali as the next caliph but there is no evidence that he coordinated with them. Ali also rejected the requests to lead the rebels, although he probably sympathized with their grievances. He was therefore considered a natural focus for the opposition, at least morally.

==== Assassination of Uthman (656) ====
As their grievances mounted, provincial dissidents poured into Medina in 656. The Egyptian opposition sought the advice of Ali, who urged them to negotiate with Uthman. Ali similarly asked the Iraqi opposition to refrain from violence, which they heeded. He also repeatedly mediated between Uthman and the dissidents, to address their economical and political grievances. In particular, Ali negotiated and guaranteed the agreement that ended the first siege. He then convinced Uthman to publicly repent, but the caliph soon retracted his statement, possibly pressed by his secretary Marwan ibn al-Hakam. Egyptian rebels laid siege to Uthman&#x27;s residence for a second time when they intercepted an official letter ordering their punishment. They demanded the caliph&#x27;s abdication but he refused and maintained his innocence about the letter, for which Marwan is often blamed in the early sources. Ali also sided with Uthman, but the caliph apparently accused him about the letter. This is probably when Ali refused to further intercede for Uthman, who was assassinated soon afterward by Egyptian rebels. Ali played no role in the deadly attack, and his son Hasan was injured while guarding Uthman&#x27;s besieged residence at the request of Ali. He also convinced the rebels to deliver water to Uthman&#x27;s house during the siege.

==Caliphate==
===Election (656)===

When Uthman was assassinated in 656 by Egyptian rebels, the potential candidates for caliphate were Ali and Talha. The Umayyads had fled Medina, leaving the provincial rebels and the Ansar in control of the city. Among the Egyptians, Talha enjoyed some support, but the Iraqis and most of the Ansar supported Ali. The majority of the Muhajirun, and key tribal figures also favored Ali at this time. The caliphate was offered by these groups to Ali, who, after some hesitation, publicly took the oath of office. Malik al-Ashtar might have been the first to pledge his allegiance to Ali. Talha and Zubayr, who both aspired to the caliphate, also gave their pledges to Ali, most likely willingly, but later broke their oaths. Ali probably did not force anyone to pledge, and there is little evidence of any violence, even though many broke with Ali later, claiming that they had pledged under duress. At the same time, the supporters, who were in majority in Medina, might have intimidated others.

==== Legitimacy ====

Ali thus filled the power vacuum created by the regicide. His election, irregular and without a council, faced little public opposition in Medina, but the rebels&#x27; support for him left him exposed to accusations of complicity in Uthman&#x27;s assassination. Even though underprivileged groups readily rallied around Ali, he had limited support among the powerful Quraysh, some of whom aspired to caliphate. Within the Quraysh, two camps opposed Ali: the Umayyads, who believed that the caliphate was their right after Uthman, and those who wished to restore the caliphate of Quraysh on the same principles laid by Abu Bakr and Umar. This second group was likely the majority within the Quraysh. Ali was indeed vocal about the divine prerogative of Muhammad&#x27;s kin to leadership, which would have jeopardized the political ambitions of the rest of the Quraysh.

=== Administrative policies ===
==== Justice ====
The caliphate of Ali was characterized by his strict justice. He implemented radical policies to restore his vision of prophetic governance, and dismissed nearly all of Uthman&#x27;s governors, whom he considered corrupt. Ali also distributed the treasury funds equally among Muslims, following the practice of Muhammad, and is said to have shown zero tolerance for corruption. Some of those affected by Ali&#x27;s egalitarian policies soon revolted against him under the pretext of revenge for Uthman. Among them was Mu&#x27;awiya, the incumbent governor of Syria. Ali has therefore been criticized by some for political naivety and excessive rigorism, and praised by others for righteousness and lack of political expediency. His supporters identify similar decisions of Muhammad, and argue that Islam never allows for compromising on a just cause, citing verse 68:9 of the Quran, &quot;They wish that thou might compromise and that they might compromise.&quot; Some instead suggest that Ali&#x27;s decisions were actually justified on a practical level. For instance, the removal of unpopular governors was perhaps the only option available to Ali because injustice was the main grievance of the rebels.

==== Religious authority ====
As evident from his public speeches, Ali viewed himself not only as the temporal leader of the Muslim community but also as its exclusive religious authority. He thus laid claim to the religious authority to interpret the Quran and Sunna. Some supporters of Ali indeed held him as their divinely-guided leader who deserved the same type of loyalty that Muhammad did. They felt an absolute and all-encompassing bond of spiritual loyalty () to Ali that transcended politics. For instance, many of them publicly offered Ali their unconditional support circa 658. They justified their absolute loyalty to Ali on the basis of his merits, precedent in Islam, his kinship with Muhammad, and also the announcement by the latter at the Ghadir Khumm. Many of these supporters also viewed Ali as the rightful successor to Muhammad after his death, as evidenced in the poetry from that period, for instance.

==== Fiscal policies ====
Ali opposed centralized control over provincial revenues. He equally distributed excess taxes and booty among Muslims, following the precedent of Muhammad and Abu Bakr. In comparison, Umar had distributed the state revenues according to perceived Islamic merit, and Uthman was widely accused of nepotism and corruption. The strictly egalitarian policies of Ali earned him the support of underprivileged groups, including the Ansar, the , and the late immigrants to Iraq. By contrast, Talha and Zubayr were both Qurayshite companions of Muhammad who had amassed immense wealth under Uthman. They both revolted against Ali when he refused to grant them favors. Some other figures among the Quraysh similarly turned against Ali, who even withheld public funds from his relatives, whereas his archenemy Mu&#x27;awiya readily offered bribes. Ali instructed his officials to collect tax payments on a voluntary basis and without harassment, and to prioritize the poor when distributing public funds. A letter attributed to Ali directs his governor to pay more attention to land development than taxation.

==== Rules of war ====
During the Muslim civil war, Ali forbade his soldiers from looting, and instead paid them from tax revenues. He also pardoned his enemies in victory. Both of these practices were later enshrined in Islamic law. Ali also advised his commander al-Ashtar not to reject any calls to peace, not to violate any agreements, and ordered him not to commence hostilities. Ali similarly barred his troops from disturbing civilians, killing the wounded and those who fled, mutilating the dead, entering homes without permission, looting, and harming women. He prevented the enslavement of women in victory, even though some protested. Before the Battle of Siffin with Mu&#x27;awiya, Ali did not retaliate and allowed his enemies to access drinking water when he gained the upper hand.

===Battle of the Camel===

Aisha publicly campaigned against Ali immediately after his accession. She was joined in Mecca by her close relatives, Talha and Zubayr, who thus broke their earlier oaths of allegiance to Ali. This opposition demanded the punishment of Uthman&#x27;s assassins, and accused Ali of complicity in the assassination. They also called for the removal of Ali from office and for a Qurayshite council to appoint his successor. Their primary goal was likely the removal of Ali, rather than vengeance for Uthman, against whom the triumvirate had stirred up public opinion. The opposition failed to gain enough traction in Hejaz, and instead captured Basra in Iraq, killing many there. Ali raised an army from nearby Kufa, which formed the core of Ali&#x27;s forces in the coming battles. The two armies soon camped just outside of Basra, both probably numbered around ten thousand men. After three days of failed negotiations, the two sides readied for battle.

==== Account of the battle ====
The battle took place in December 656. The rebels commenced hostilities, and Aisha was present on the battlefield, riding in an armored palanquin atop a red camel, after which the battle is named. Talha was soon killed by another rebel, Marwan, the secretary of Uthman. Zubayr, an experienced fighter, deserted shortly after the battle had begun, but was pursued and killed. His desertion suggests he had serious moral misgivings about their cause. Ali won the day, and Aisha was respectfully escorted back to Hejaz. Ali then announced a public pardon, setting free all war prisoners, even Marwan, and prohibiting the enslavement of their women. Their seized properties were also returned. Ali then stationed himself in Kufa, which thus became his de facto capital.

===Battle of Siffin===
Mu&#x27;awiya, the incumbent governor of Syria, was deemed corrupt and unfit by Ali, who wrote to and removed him from his post. In turn, Mu&#x27;awiya, as Uthman&#x27;s cousin, launched a propaganda campaign across Syria, blaming Ali for the regicide and calling for revenge. Mu&#x27;awiya also joined forces with Amr ibn al-As, a military strategist, who pledged to back the Umayyads against Ali in return for life-long governorship of Egypt. Yet Mu&#x27;awiya also secretly offered to recognize the caliphate of Ali in return for Syria and Egypt, which Ali rejected. Mu&#x27;awiya then formally declared war, charging Ali with regicide, demanding his removal, and a Syrian council thereafter to elect the next caliph. Contemporary authors tend to view Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s call for revenge as a pretext for a power grab.

==== Account of the battle ====
In the summer of 657, the armies of Ali and Mu&#x27;awiya camped at Siffin, west of the Euphrates River, numbering perhaps at 100,000 and 130,000, respectively. Many of Muhammad&#x27;s companions were present in Ali&#x27;s army, whereas Mu&#x27;awiya could only boast a handful. The two sides negotiated for a while, to no avail, after which the main battle took place from Wednesday, 26 July 657, until Friday or Saturday morning. Ali probably refrained from initiating hostilities, and later fought alongside his men on the frontline, whereas Mu&#x27;awiya led from his pavilion, and rejected a proposal to settle the matters in a personal duel with Ali. Among those killed fighting for Ali was Ammar. In canonical Sunni sources, a prophetic hadith predicts Ammar&#x27;s death at the hands of () who call to hellfire.

==== Call to arbitration ====
Fighting stopped when some Syrians raised pages of the Quran on their lances, shouting, &quot;Let the Book of God be the judge between us.&quot; Since Mu&#x27;awiya had for long insisted on battle, this call for arbitration suggests that he now feared defeat. By contrast, Ali exhorted his men to fight, telling them that raising Qurans was for deception, but to no avail. Through their representatives, the and the tribesmen of Kufa, the largest bloc in Ali&#x27;s army, both threatened Ali with mutiny if he did not answer the Syrians&#x27; call. Facing strong peace sentiments in his army, Ali accepted the arbitration proposal, most likely against his own judgment.

==== Arbitration agreement ====
Mu&#x27;awiya now proposed that representatives from both sides should find a Quranic resolution. Mu&#x27;awiya was represented by his ally Amr, whereas, despite Ali&#x27;s opposition, the majority in his camp pressed for the neutral Abu Musa, the erstwhile governor of Kufa. The arbitration agreement was written and signed on 2 August 657, stipulating that the two representatives should meet on neutral territory, adhere to the Quran and Sunna, and restore peace. Both armies left the battlefield after the agreement. The arbitration agreement thus divided Ali&#x27;s camp, as many did not support his negotiations with Mu&#x27;awiya, whose claims they considered fraudulent. By contrast, the agreement strengthened Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s position, who was now an equal contender for the caliphate.

==== Formation of the Kharijites ====
Some of Ali&#x27;s men left him in protest to the arbitration agreement. Many of them eventually rejoined Ali, while the rest gathered in the town of al-Nahrawan. They became known as the Kharijites (), who later took up arms against Ali in the Battle of Nahrawan. The Kharijites, many of whom belonged to the , were likely disillusioned with the arbitration process. Their slogan was, &quot;No judgment but that of God,&quot; highlighting their rejection of arbitration (by men) in reference to the Quranic verse 49:9. Ali called this slogan a word of truth by which the seceders sought falsehood because he viewed the ruler as indispensable in the conduct of religion.

==== Arbitration proceedings ====
The two arbitrators met together in Dumat al-Jandal, perhaps in February 658. There they reached the verdict that Uthman had been killed wrongfully and that Mu&#x27;awiya had the right to seek revenge. They could not agree on anything else. Rather than a judicial ruling, this was a political concession by Abu Musa, who probably hoped that Amr would later reciprocate this gesture. Ali denounced the conduct of the two arbitrators as contrary to the Quran and began organizing a second Syria campaign. Solely an initiative of Mu&#x27;awiya, there was also a second meeting in Udhruh. The negotiations there also failed, as the two arbitrators could not agree on the next caliph: Amr supported Mu&#x27;awiya, while Abu Musa nominated his son-in-law Abd Allah ibn Umar, who stood down. At its closure, Abu Musa publicly deposed both Mu&#x27;awiya and Ali and called for a council to appoint his successor per earlier agreements with Amr. When Amr took the stage, however, he deposed Ali and appointed Mu&#x27;awiya as his successor. The Kufan delegation reacted furiously to Abu Musa&#x27;s concessions, and the common view is that the arbitration failed, or was inconclusive. It nevertheless strengthened the Syrians&#x27; support for Mu&#x27;awiya and weakened the position of Ali.

===Battle of Nahrawan===
After the arbitration, Mu&#x27;awiya received the Syrians&#x27; pledge as caliph. Ali then organized a new, much smaller, Syria campaign. But he postponed the expedition, and instead marched to Nahrawan with his army, when he learned that the Kharijites were interrogating and executing civilians. They killed many, apparently not even sparing women. Ali convinced many of the Kharijites to separate from their army, leaving about 1,5001,800, or 2,800, out of about 4,000 fighters. The rest of the Kharijites then attacked and were crushed by Ali&#x27;s army of about 14,000 men. The battle took place either on 17 July 658, or in 657. Ali has been criticized by some for killing his erstwhile allies, many of whom were outwardly pious Muslims. For others, subduing the Kharijites was necessary, for they were violent and radicalized rebels who posed a danger to Ali&#x27;s base in Kufa.

===Final years===
Following the Battle of Nahrawan, Ali could not muster enough support for a second Syria campaign. Perhaps his soldiers were demoralized, or perhaps they were recalled by their tribal leaders, many of whom had been bribed and swayed by Mu&#x27;awiya. By contrast, Ali did not grant any financial favors to tribal chiefs as a matter of principle. At any rate, the secession of so many of the and the coolness of the tribal leaders weakened Ali. Ali consequently lost Egypt to Mu&#x27;awiya in 658. Mu&#x27;awiya also began dispatching military detachments, which targeted civilians along the Euphrates river, near Kufa, and most successfully, in the Hejaz and Yemen. Ali could not mount a timely response to these assaults. He eventually found sufficient support for a second Syria offensive, set to commence in late winter 661. His success was in part due to the public outrage over Syrian raids. However, plans for a second campaign were abandoned after the assassination of Ali.

==Assassination and burial==

Ali was assassinated during the morning prayer on 28 January 661 (19 Ramadan 40 AH) at the Great Mosque of Kufa. The other given dates are 26 and 30 January. He was struck over his head by the Kharijite dissident Ibn Muljam with a poison-coated sword, in revenge for their defeat in the Battle of Nahrawan. Ali died from his wounds about two days later, aged sixty-two or sixty-three. By some accounts, he had long known about his fate by premonition or through Muhammad. Before his death, Ali requested either a meticulous application of to Ibn Muljam or his pardon. At any rate, Ibn Muljam was later executed by Hasan, the eldest son of Ali. Fearing that his body might be exhumed and profaned by his enemies, Ali&#x27;s burial place was kept a secret and remains uncertain. Several sites are mentioned as containing Ali&#x27;s remains, including the shrine of Ali in Najaf and the shrine of Ali in Mazar. The former site was identified during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid () and the town of Najaf developed around it, which has become a major destination for Shia pilgrimage. The present shrine was built by the Safavid monarch Safi (), near which lies an immense cemetery for Shias who wished to be buried next to their imam. Najaf is also home to top religious colleges and prominent Shia scholars. Other sites for Ali&#x27;s burial are claimed to be Baghdad, Damascus, Medina, Ray while a minority of Shias believe it be somewhere in the city of Kufa.

==Succession==

When Ali died, his son Hasan was acknowledged as the next caliph in Kufa. As Ali&#x27;s legatee, Hasan was the obvious choice for the Kufans, especially because Ali was vocal about the exclusive right of Muhammad&#x27;s kin to leadership. Most surviving companions of Muhammad were in Ali&#x27;s army, and they also pledged their allegiance to Hasan, but overall the Kufans&#x27; support for Hasan was likely weak. Hasan later abdicated in August 661 to Mu&#x27;awiya when the latter marched on Iraq with a large force. Mu&#x27;awiya thus founded the dynastic Umayyad Caliphate. Throughout his reign, he persecuted the family and supporters of Ali, and mandated regular public cursing of Ali.

==Descendants of Ali==

The first marriage of Ali was to Fatima, who bore him three sons, Hasan, Husayn, and Muhsin. Muhsin either died in infancy, or Fatima miscarried him when she was injured in a raid on her house during the succession crisis. The descendants of Hasan and Husayn are known as the Hasanids and the Husaynids, respectively. As the progeny of Muhammad, they are honored in Muslim communities by nobility titles such as and . Ali and Fatima also had two daughters, Zaynab and Umm Kulthum. After Fatima&#x27;s death in 632, Ali remarried multiple times and had more children, including Muhammad al-Awsat and Abbas ibn Ali. In his life, Ali fathered seventeen daughters, and eleven, fourteen, or eighteen sons, among whom, Hasan, Husayn, and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya played a historical role. Descendants of Ali are known as the Alids.

=== Under the Umayyads (661750) ===
Mu&#x27;awiya succeeded Ali in 661 and founded the dynastic Umayyad Caliphate, during which Alids were severely persecuted. After Ali, his followers () recognized his eldest son Hasan as their imam. When he died in 670, likely poisoned at the instigation of Mu&#x27;awiya, the Shia community followed Hasan&#x27;s younger brother Husayn, who was killed by Umayyad forces in the Battle of Karbala in 680, alongside many of his relatives. To revenge the Karbala massacre, soon followed in 685 the Shia uprising of al-Mukhtar, who claimed to represent Ibn al-Hanafiyya. The main movements that followed this uprising were the now-extinct Kaysanites and the Imamites. The Kaysanites mostly followed Abu Hashim, the son of Ibn al-Hanafiya. When Abu Hashim died around 716, this group largely aligned itself with the Abbasids, that is, the descendants of Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas. On the other hand, the Imamites were led by quiescent descendants of Husayn, through his only surviving son, Ali Zayn al-Abidin (). An exception was Ali&#x27;s son Zayd, who led a failed uprising against the Umayyads around 740. For his followers, known as the Zaydites, any learned Hasanid or Husaynid who rose against tyranny qualified as imam.

=== Under the Abbasids (7501258) ===
Alids were also persecuted under the Abbasids, who toppled the Umayyads in 750. Some of the Alids thus revolted, while some established regional dynasties in remote areas. In particular, through imprisonment or surveillance, the Abbasids removed the imams of the Imamites from public life, and they are thought to be responsible for the imams&#x27; deaths. Mainstream Imamites were the antecedents of the Twelvers, who believe that their twelfth and final imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, was born around 868, but was hidden from the public in 874 for fear of persecution. He remains in occultation by divine will until his reappearance at the end of time to eradicate injustice and evil. The only historic split among the Imamites happened when their sixth imam, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, died in 765. Some claimed that his designated successor was his son Isma&#x27;il, who had predeceased al-Sadiq. These were the antecedents of the Isma&#x27;ilites, who found political success at the turn of the tenth century, as the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt and the Qarmatians in Bahrain.

==Works==


Most of the works attributed to Ali were first delivered as speeches and later committed to writing by others. There are also supplications, such as Du&#x27;a Kumayl, which he may have taught others.

 () is an eleventh-century collection of sermons, letters, and sayings, all attributed to Ali, compiled by Sharif al-Radi (), a prominent Twelver scholar. Because of its sometimes sensitive content, the authenticity of has long been polemically debated. However, by tracking its content in earlier sources, recent academic research has attributed most of to Ali. The book, particularly its letter of instructions addressed at al-Ashtar, has served as an ideological basis for Islamic governance. The book also includes detailed discussions about social responsibilities, emphasizing that greater responsibilities result in greater rights. also contains sensitive material, such as sharp criticism of Ali&#x27;s predecessors in its Shaqshaqiya sermon, and disapproval of Aisha, Talha, and Zubayr, who had revolted against Ali. Celebrated as an example of the most eloquent Arabic, has significantly influenced the Arabic literature and rhetoric. Numerous commentaries have been written about the book, including the comprehensive work of the Mu&#x27;tazilite scholar Ibn Abil-Hadid ().


 () was compiled by Abd al-Wahid al-Amidi (), who was either a Shafi&#x27;i jurist or a Twelver scholar. The book contains thousands of short sayings of Ali on piety and ethics. These aphorisms and other works attributed to Ali have considerably influenced the Islamic mysticism.

===Mushaf of Ali===

Mushaf of Ali is a recension of the Quran compiled by Ali, who was one of its first scribes. By some Shia accounts, this codex () of Ali was rejected for official use during the succession crisis. Some early Shia traditions also suggest differences with the standard Uthmanid codex, although now the prevalent Shia view is that Ali&#x27;s recension matches the Uthmanid codex, save for the order of its content. Ali&#x27;s codex is said to be in the possession of Muhammad al-Mahdi, who would reveal the codex (and its authoritative commentary by Ali) when he reappears.
 () is a non-extant collection of prophetic sayings gathered by Ali. The book may have concerned matters of lawfulness () and unlawfulness (), including a detailed penal code. &#x27; is also often linked to , which is said to contain the esoteric teachings of Muhammad for his household. Copies of &#x27; were likely available until the early eighth century, and parts of it have survived in later Shia and Sunni works.

===Other works===
The is a popular Shia supplication attributed to Ali, transmitted by his companion, Kumayl ibn Ziyad. Also attributed to Ali is on Islamic law, fully quoted in the Shia hadith collection . The judicial decisions and executive orders of Ali during his caliphate have also been recorded. Other extant works attributed to Ali are collected in and other Shia sources.

== Contributions to Islamic sciences ==

The standard recitation of the Quran has been traced back to Ali, and his written legacy is dotted with Quranic commentaries. Ibn Abbas, a leading early exegete, credited Ali with his interpretations of the Quran. Ali also related several hundred prophetic hadiths. He is further credited with the first systematic evaluations of hadiths, and is often considered a founding figure for hadith sciences. Ali is also regarded by some as the founder of Islamic theology, and his sayings contain the first rational proofs of the unity of God () in Islam. In later Islamic philosophy, Ali&#x27;s sayings and sermons were mined for metaphysical knowledge. In particular, is a vital source for Shia philosophical doctrines, after the Quran and Sunna. As a Shia imam, statements and practices attributed to Ali are widely studied in Shia Islam, where they are viewed as the continuation of prophetic teachings.

==Names and titles==

Ali is known by many honorifics in the Islamic tradition, some of which are especially used by Shias. His main (teknonym) was (&quot;father of al-Hasan&quot;). His titles include &quot;al-Murtaḍā&quot; (), &quot;Asad Allāh&quot; (), &quot;Ḥaydar&quot; (, the name initially her mother gave him), &quot;Amīr al-Muʾminīn&quot; (), and &quot;Imām al-Muttaqin&quot; (). In particular, Twelvers consider the title of Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin to be unique to Ali. He is also referred to as &quot;Abū Turāb&quot; (), which might have initially been a pejorative by his enemies.

== Character ==

Often praised for his piety and courage, Ali fought to uphold his beliefs, but was also magnanimous in victory, even risking the ire of some supporters to prevent the enslavement of women. He also showed his grief, wept for the dead, and reportedly prayed over his enemies. Yet Ali has also been criticized for his idealism and political inflexibility, for his egalitarian policies and strict justice antagonized many. Or perhaps these qualities were also present in Muhammad, whom the Quran addresses as, &quot;They wish that thou [Muhammad] might compromise and that they might compromise.&quot; At any rate, these qualities of Ali, rooted in his religious beliefs, contributed to his image today for his followers as a paragon of Islamic virtues, particularly justice. Ali is also viewed as the model for Islamic chivalry ().

Historical accounts about Ali are often tendentious. For instance, in person, Ali is described in some Sunni sources as bald, heavy-built, short-legged, with broad shoulders, hairy body, long white beard, and affected by eye inflammation. Shia accounts about the appearance of Ali are markedly different. Those perhaps better match his reputation as a capable warrior. Likewise, in manner, Ali is presented in some Sunni sources as rough, brusque, and unsociable. By contrast, Shia sources describe him as generous, gentle, and cheerful, to the point that the Syrian war propaganda accused him of frivolity. Shia and Sufi sources are also replete with reports about his acts of kindness, especially to the poor. The necessary qualities in a commander, described in a letter attributed to Ali, may have well been a portrait of himself: slow to anger, happy to pardon, kind to the weak, and severe with the strong. His companion, Sa&#x27;sa&#x27;a ibn Suhan, described him similarly, &quot;He [Ali] was amongst us as one of us, of gentle disposition, intense humility, leading with a light touch, even though we were in awe of him with the kind of awe that a bound prisoner has before one who holds a sword over his head.&quot;

== Assessment and legacy ==


=== In Islam ===
Ali&#x27;s place is said to be second only to Muhammad in Muslim culture. Ali is revered for his courage, honesty, unbending devotion to Islam, magnanimity, and equal treatment of all Muslims. For his admirers, he has thus become the archetype of uncorrupted Islam and pre-Islamic chivalry.

==== In the Quran ====
Ali regularly represented Muhammad in missions which are commonly linked to Quranic injunctions. For instance, the verse of (5:55) is a reference to when Ali gave his ring to a beggar, while praying in the mosque, according to Shia and some Sunni accounts. If so, then this verse gives Ali the same spiritual authority () as Muhammad. In Shia sources, the (5:67) spurred Muhammad to designate Ali as his successor at the Ghadir Khumm, while the (5:3) subsequently announced the perfection of Islam. The verse of purification (33:33) concerns the status of purity of the Ahl al-Bayt (), which is limited to Ali, Fatima, and their two sons in Shia and some Sunni sources. Another reference to the Ahl al-Bayt might be the verse of (42:23). For Shias, this verse is a Quranic mandate to love and follow the Ahl al-Bayt.

==== In hadith literature ====
Muhammad frequently praise the qualities of Ali. The most controversial such statement, &quot;He whose I am, Ali is his ,&quot; was delivered at the Ghadir Khumm. This gave Ali the same spiritual authority () as Muhammad, according to the Shia. Elsewhere, the hadith of the position likens Muhammad and Ali to Moses and Aaron, and thus supports the usurped right of Ali to succeed Muhammad in Shia Islam. Other examples in standard Shia and Sunni collections of hadith include, &quot;There is no youth braver than Ali,&quot; &quot;No-one but a believer loves Ali, and no-one but a hypocrite () hates Ali,&quot; &quot;I am from Ali, and Ali is from me, and he is the () of every believer after me,&quot; &quot;The truth revolves around him [Ali] wherever he goes,&quot; &quot;I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate (),&quot; &quot;Ali is with the Quran and the Quran is with Ali. They will not separate until they return to me at the [paradisal] pool.&quot;

==== In Sufism ====
Ali is the common source of mystical and spiritual currents within both Sunni and Shia sects of Islam. In particular, Ali is the spiritual head of some Sufi movements, for Sufis believe that Ali inherited from Muhammad his esoteric knowledge and saintly authority, which guide believers on their journey toward God. Nearly all Sufi orders trace their lineage to Muhammad through Ali, an exception being the Naqshbandis, who reach Muhammad through Abu Bakr.

==== In Sunni Islam ====

In Sunni Islam, Ali is venerated as a close companion of Muhammad, a foremost authority on the Quran and Islamic law, and the fountainhead of wisdom in Sunni spirituality. When the prophet died in 632, Ali had his claims to leadership, perhaps in reference to the Ghadir Khumm, but he eventually accepted the temporal rule of the first three caliphs in the interest of Muslim unity. Ali is portrayed in Sunni sources as a trusted advisor of the first three caliphs, while their conflicts with Ali are minimized, in line with the Sunni tendency to show accord among companions. As the fourth and final Rashidun caliph, Ali holds a particularly high status in Sunni Islam, although this doctrinal reverence for Ali is a recent development for which the prominent Sunni traditionist Ibn Hanbal () is likely to be credited. Sunni hierarchy of companions places Ali below his three predecessors and above those who fought against him. This ordering has required Sunni reinterpretation of those prophetic sayings that explicitly elevate Ali above all companions.

==== In Shia Islam ====

Ali takes center stage in Shia Islam: The Arabic word &quot;shi&#x27;a&quot; itself is short for &#x27; of Ali&#x27; (), his name is incorporated into the daily call to prayer (), and he is regarded as the foremost companion of Muhammad. The defining doctrine of Shia Islam is that Ali was the rightful successor of Muhammad through divinely-ordained designation, which is primarily a reference to the Ghadir Khumm. Ali is thought to have inherited the political and religious authority of Muhammad, even before his ascension to the caliphate in 656. In particular, Ali&#x27;s predecessors are regarded as illegitimate rulers and usurpers of his rights. The all-encompassing bond of loyalty between Shia Muslims and their imams (and Muhammad in his capacity as imam) is known as . Ali is also thought to be endowed with the privilege of intercession on the Judgment Day. Early on, some Shias even attributed divinity to Ali, but such extreme views were gradually rooted out of Shi&#x27;ism.

In Shia belief, Ali also inherited the esoteric knowledge of Muhammad, for instance, in view of the prophetic hadith, &quot;I [Muhammad] am the city of knowledge, and Ali is its gate.&quot; Ali is thus regarded, after Muhammad, as the interpreter, , of the Quran and the sole authoritative source of its (esoteric) teachings. Unlike Muhammad, however, Ali is not thought to have received divine revelation (), though he might have been guided by divine inspiration (). Verse 21:73 of the Quran is sometimes cited here, &quot;We made them imams, guiding by Our command, and We revealed () to them the performance of good deeds, the maintenance of prayers, and the giving of  (alms), and they used to worship Us.&quot; Shia Muslims also believe in the infallibility of Ali, as with Muhammad, that is, their divine protection from sins. Here, the verse of purification is sometimes cited. Ali&#x27;s words and deeds are therefore considered a model for the Shia community and a source for their religious injunctions.

==== In Alawism ====
The Alawites venerate Ali, the first of the Twelve Imams, as the physical manifestation of God. Even, the Alawite testimony of faith (&quot;shahada&quot;) translates as &quot;there is no God but Ali&quot;. The Alawite trinity envisions God as being composed of three distinct manifestations, &quot;Ma&#x27;na&quot; (meaning), &quot;Ism&quot; (Name) and &quot;Bab&quot; (Door); which together constitute an &quot;indivisible trinity&quot;. &quot;Ma&#x27;na&quot; symbolises the &quot;source and meaning of all things&quot; in Alawite mythology. According to Alawite doctrines, &quot;Ma&#x27;na&quot; generated the &quot;Ism&quot;, which in turn built the &quot;Bab&quot;. These beliefs are closely tied to the Alawite doctrine of reincarnations of the trinity. The final trinity of reincarnation in the Alawite trinity consists of Ali (&quot;Ma&#x27;na&quot;), Muhammad (&quot;Ism&quot;) and Salman the Persian (&quot;Bab&quot;). Alewites depict them as the sky, sun and moon respectively. Alawites deify Ali as the &quot;last and supreme manifestation of God&quot; who built the universe, attribute to him divine superiority, and believe that Ali created Muhammad and gave him the mission to spread Qur&#x27;anic teachings on earth.

=== In other religions ===
In the Druze faith, Ali is considered a &quot;minor prophet,&quot; like Plato and Socrates. Even though the faith originally developed out of the Isma&#x27;ili branch of Shia Islam, the Druze are not Muslims, and do not accept the five pillars of Islam. In Yarsanism, a religion founded by the Kurdish mystic Sultan Sahak, Ali is thought to be an incarnation of God, and superior to Muhammad, but their image as a Ghulat () subsect of Shia Islam is incorrect&quot;.&quot;

==Historiography==

Much has been written about Ali in Islamic literature, second only to Muhammad. However, much of this material is colored by a positive or negative bias towards Ali. The primary sources about Ali are the Quran, hadiths, and other early Islamic works, the most notable being &quot;The Book of Sulaym ibn Qays&quot;, attributed to a companion of Ali. Such works were initially scarce, but this changed with the introduction of affordable paper in the Abbasid period. For instance, at least twenty-one monographs were composed on the Battle of Siffin between 750 and 950, thirteen of which were authored by the early historian Abu Mikhnaf (). Most of these monographs are not extant except through quotations in later collections, such as the tenth-century . In addition to numerous works authored by Muslims, the secondary sources about Ali include writings of Arab Christians, Hindus, and also works by Western scholars. When writing about Ali, early Western scholars often dismissed as fabricated the reports gathered in later periods because their authors often advanced their own Sunni or Shia partisan views. For instance, L. Caetani () often rejected the historical reports attributed to the pro-Ali Ibn Abbas and anti-Ali Aisha. Caetani instead preferred accounts reported without  by early historians like Ibn Ishaq (). By contrast, W. Madelung () argued that the tendentiousness of a report alone does not imply its fabrication. Madelung instead advocated for the authentication of historical reports on the basis of their compatibility with other events and figures.

<text>was an observation and radio tower built beside the headquarters of Asahi Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan. It also relayed radio communication the taxi companies.

== Form ==
The tower was high. Built in 1966, it was constructed with metal tubing in a quadratic lattice structure and was designed to handle vibrations and a wind velocity of up to . up, there was a two-story observation deck. Below this, the tower was painted in white and above it in red and white.

== Function ==
The tower cost 400 million yen and construction was finished in 1966. It had an elevator that could carry 30 persons up to the observation deck, which in turn, could accommodate 270 persons. 4,000 visitors attended the inauguration. In 1979, the &quot;Sky Studio&quot; was installed on the second floor of the observation deck, broadcasting a morning show with weather, traffic conditions, etc. The observation deck was closed to the public in 1997 after heightened security measures due to, among other things, the mail bomb incident of 1994. In 2008, the tower was scheduled to be removed, when the headquarters of ABC moved to Fukushima-ku, Osaka. It was finally demolished in 2009.

<text>This is a list of languages by number of native speakers.

All such rankings of human languages ranked by their number of native speakers should be used with caution, because it is not possible to devise a coherent set of linguistic criteria for distinguishing languages in a dialect continuum. For example, a language is often defined as a set of mutually intelligible varieties, but independent national standard languages may be considered separate languages even though they are largely mutually intelligible, as in the case of Danish and Norwegian. Conversely, many commonly accepted languages, including German, Italian, and English, encompass varieties that are not mutually intelligible. While Arabic is sometimes considered a single language centred on Modern Standard Arabic, other authors consider its mutually unintelligible varieties separate languages. Similarly, Chinese is sometimes viewed as a single language because of a shared culture and common literary language. It is also common to describe various Chinese dialect groups, such as Mandarin, Wu, and Yue, as languages, even though each of these groups contains many mutually unintelligible varieties.

There are also difficulties in obtaining reliable counts of speakers, which vary over time because of population change and language shift. In some areas, there is no reliable census data, the data is not current, or the census may not record languages spoken, or record them ambiguously. Sometimes speaker populations are exaggerated for political reasons, or speakers of minority languages may be underreported in favour of a national language.

==Top languages by population==
===&quot;Ethnologue&quot; (2025)===
According to &quot;Ethnologue,&quot; the following languages have more than 50 million first-language speakers as of 2025. This section does not include entries that &quot;Ethnologue&quot; identifies as macrolanguages encompassing all their respective varieties, such as Arabic, Lahnda, Persian, Malay, Pashto, and Chinese.

<text>__notoc__

Nashim ( &quot;Women&quot; or &quot;Wives&quot;) is the third order of the Mishnah (also of the Tosefta and Talmud) containing family law. Of the six orders of the Mishnah, it is the shortest.

Nashim consists of seven tractates:

#Yevamot ( &quot;Brothers-in-Law&quot;) deals with the Jewish law of yibbum (levirate marriage) () and other topics such as the status of minors. It consists of 16 chapters.
#Ketubot (, &quot;Prenuptial agreements&quot;) deals with the ketubah (Judaism&#x27;s prenuptial agreement), as well as topics such as virginity, and the obligations of a couple towards each other. It consists of 13 chapters.
#Nedarim (, &quot;Vows&quot;) deals with various types of vows often known as &quot;nedarim&quot; and their legal consequences. It consists of 11 chapters.
#&quot;Nazir&quot; ( &quot;One who abstains&quot;) deals with the details of the Nazirite vow and being a Nazirite (). It consists of 9 chapters.
#Sotah ( &quot;Wayward wife&quot;) deals with the ritual of the sotah, the woman suspected of adultery () as well as other rituals involving a spoken formula (such as breaking the heifer&#x27;s neck, the King&#x27;s Septennial public Torah reading, the Blessings and Curses of Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, etc...). It consists of nine chapters.
#Gittin: ( &quot;Documents&quot;) deals with the concepts of divorces and other documents. It consists of 9 chapters.
#Kiddushin: ( &quot;Betrothal&quot;) deals with the initial stage of marriage – betrothal, as well as the laws of Jewish lineages. It consists of 4 chapters.

==Order of tractates==
The traditional reasoning for the order of tractates according to Maimonides is as follows:
*&quot;Yevamot&quot; is first because unlike the others, it is largely concerned with a compulsory commandment (levirate marriage) as opposed to a voluntary one.
*&quot;Ketubot&quot; follows as it signifies the beginning of married life.
*&quot;Nedarim&quot; follows because once a man is married to a woman, he has the legal right (under certain conditions) to annul her vows.
*&quot;Nazir&quot;, dealing with a special type of vow is a continuation on the subject of vows.
*The penultimate sections deal with the end of a marriage with &quot;Sotah&quot; which is concerned with infidelity and &quot;Gittin&quot; which is about actual divorce (Rambam&#x27;s order swaps these two).
*&quot;Kiddushin&quot; is at the end because it follows the Scriptural order that once a woman is divorced, she can get betrothed to any man, this subsequent betrothal symbolised by the placement of &quot;Kiddushin&quot;.

Both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds have a Gemara on each of the tractates in the order.

Malenchenko became the first person to marry in space, on 10 August 2003, when he married Ekaterina Dmitrieva, who was in Texas, while he was over New Zealand, on the International Space Station. As of December 2023, Malenchenko ranks third for career time in space due to his time on both Mir and the International Space Station (ISS). He is a former commander of the International Space Station.

==Personal life==
Malenchenko was born in Khrushchev, Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukrainian SSR. He and his wife Ekaterina Dmitrieva have one child.

==Education==
Malenchenko graduated from the Kharkiv Military Aviation School in 1983, and attended the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy, graduating in 1993.

==Awards==
Malenchenko was awarded:
* Hero of the Russian Federation,
* the National Hero of Kazakhstan medal,
* Military award of excellence,
* Commendation medal,
* Achievement medal,
* Jubilee Medal &quot;70 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR&quot;
* Meritorious Service Medals 1st, 2nd and 3rd class.

==Cosmonaut career==
After graduation from the Military Aviation School, he served as a pilot, senior pilot and multi-ship flight lead from 1983 till 1987 in the Odessa Region. In 1987 he was selected as a cosmonaut, and arrived at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. From December 1987 to June 1989 Malenchenko underwent a course of general space training. After completion of the course, he was qualified as a test-cosmonaut. Between September 1989 to December 1993 he was taking advanced training courses in preparation for spaceflight. In January–July, 1993 Malenchenko trained as commander of the Mir-14 reserve crew. He completed training as a backup commander of the Mir-15 crew from July 1993 to January 1994. From February to June 1994 Malenchenko trained for the Mir-16 mission.

==Spaceflight experience==

===Soyuz TM-19===
On July 1, 1994, Malenchenko and Talgat Musabayev lifted off to space on board the Soyuz TM-19 spacecraft with Malenchenko in command of the Soyuz. Following a two-day solo flight the Soyuz docked with Mir on July 3, 1994. Main goal of the mission was the partly exchange of the resident crew. Malenchenko, Musabayev and cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov became the 16th resident Mir crew, with Malenchenko in command. The crew conducted medical experiments and experiments in materials science. There were many problems during the mission, which finally ended with the first successful manual docking of a Progress supply ship at Mir by Malenchenko. On November 4, 1994, Malenchenko, Musabayev and Ulf Merbold returned to Earth aboard their Soyuz capsule after landing 88 km northeast of Arkalyk. Aboard Soyuz TM-19 and Mir complex Malenchenko spent 125 days, 22 hours, 53 minutes in space.

===STS-106===
Malenchenko served as a mission specialist for STS-106. lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on September 8, 2000. On flight day two, &quot;Atlantis&quot; completed a successful rendezvous and docking with the ISS. The objectives of the mission were to bring supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) and to prepare the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module for the arrival of the first resident crew. During the 12-day mission, the shuttle crew spent a week inside the ISS unloading supplies from both a double SPACEHAB cargo module in the rear of &quot;Atlantis&quot; cargo bay and from Progress M1-3 which was docked to the aft docking port of &quot;Zvezda&quot;. After circling the globe for 186 orbits, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed on September 19, 2000, at Runway 15, KSC. The mission lasted 11 days, 19 hours and 12 minutes.

===Expedition 7===
Malenchenko with astronaut Edward Lu lifted on board the Soyuz TMA-2 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 26, 2003, to the ISS. The spacecraft docked with the ISS on April 28, 2003. Malenchenko served as the Soyuz commander, and after docking with the ISS they exchanged with the resident crew on board ISS and became the seventh station crew, Expedition 7. He was the commander of the Expedition 7, and during his stay on the station, Malenchenko became the first person to get married in space. Soyuz TMA-2 returned to Earth on October 28, with both the Expedition 7 crew as well as Pedro Duque on board. The spacecraft landed at 02:40 UTC near Arkalyk. Aboard Soyuz TMA-2 and the ISS, Malenchenko spent 184 days, 22 hours and 46 minutes in space.

===Expedition 16===
Malenchenko with NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson and Malaysian spaceflight participant Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor blasted off to space on October 10, 2007, on Soyuz TMA-11 from the Baikonour Cosmodrome. He served as the Soyuz commander. The Soyuz spacecraft docked with the ISS after 2 days of autonomous flight on October 12, 2007. Malenchenko joined the ISS Expedition 16 crew as flight engineer 1. The Soyuz capsule landed in Kazakhstan on April 19, 2008, bringing back Malenchenko, Whitson and South Korean spaceflight participant Yi So-Yeon. Similar to Soyuz TMA-1 and Soyuz TMA-10, Soyuz TMA-11 performed a ballistic reentry, a reentry steeper than a normal reentry, due to a malfunction and landed 475 km from intended landing point, north of Arkalyk. Although the crew were recovered with no injuries, the spacecraft&#x27;s hatch and antenna suffered burn damage during the unusual reentry.

He accumulated 191 days, 19 hours and 8 minutes time in space during Soyuz TMA-11 and ISS Expedition 16 missions.

===Expedition 32/33===

===Spacewalks===

Malenchenko conducted his first and second career spacewalks during the Mir-16 mission. He and Musabayev performed two spacewalks on September 9, 1994 (5h 06m) and September 14, 1994, in which the station&#x27;s external insulation was repaired. The first and second spacewalks lasted 5 hours and 6 minutes, and 6 hours and 1 minute respectively.

Malenchenko performed his third career spacewalk during the STS-106 mission to the ISS. On flight day three, Malenchenko and NASA astronaut Ed Lu conducted a 6-hour and 14 minute space walk. The spacewalk started at 04:55 GMT on September 11 when the two spacewalkers exited the shuttle&#x27;s airlock. The spacewalk&#x27;s objective focused on routing and connecting nine power, data and communications cables between the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module and the &quot;Zarya&quot; module, as well as installing the six-foot-long magnetometer to the ISS to serve as a compass showing the space station in respect to the Earth. This spacewalk marked the sixth spacewalk in support of the ISS assembly and the 50th spacewalk in space shuttle history.

On November 9, 2007, Malenchenko performed his fourth career spacewalk. He and Expedition 16 commander, Peggy Whitson, in US EMUs ventured into space from the station&#x27;s &quot;Quest&quot; airlock at 09:54 UTC. Malenchenko&#x27;s suit was all white, and the purpose of the spacewalk was to prepare for the relocation of Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2) and the subsequent move of the &quot;Harmony&quot; node to its permanent location. As the first task, the two spacewalkers disconnected the Station to Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS) cables between the &quot;Destiny&quot; laboratory and PMA-2. Next they disconnected eight other cables between PMA-2 and the &quot;Destiny&quot;. Malenchenko removed and replaced a failed electrical circuit box and together with Whitson removed the active Common Berthing Mechanism cover that was located at the outboard end of &quot;Harmony&quot;. Next, Malenchenko moved back behind the Z1 truss to reconfigure a power system, removing an electrical jumper. The spacewalk ended at 16.49 UTC when the two spacewalkers returned to the ISS. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 55 minutes.

On 20 August 2012, Malenchenko together with cosmonaut Gennady Padalka participated in his fifth career spacewalk. Tasks assigned to the two cosmonauts included hardware relocations, installations, retrievals, and deployments. For the spacewalk, Malenchenko donned an Orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe. The duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes. The spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between Space Station modules. The spacewalk started from the Pirs Docking Compartment Module at 15:37 GMT. The first task for Padalka and Malenchenko was to relocate the Strela-2 boom from the Pirs module to the forward end of the Zarya module. The relocation was needed since Pirs module will be detached from the Space Station in the future for the arrival of the new Multi-purpose Laboratory Module (MLM) Nauka. The next task completed by Padalka and Malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite. The two cosmonauts also retrieved five debris shields from the Pirs Module, prior to installing them on the Zvezda Module. They also completed several get-ahead tasks (since they both opted not to take rests during the night passes) as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline. They retrieved an external experiment called Biorisk from the Pirs Module for return to Earth, and for added stability installed two structural support struts between the Pirs Module and the EVA ladder. Padalka and Malenchenko then both ingress the Pirs Module, prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure, to end a highly successful spacewalk.
===Expedition 46/47===

Malenchenko arrived at the ISS Soyuz TMA-19M to join the Expedition 46 crew. He performed a manual docking due to a malfunction in the automatic docking system. Progress MS-1 was then scheduled for launch to the ISS, atop a Soyuz 2.1a, on 21 December. Planned for a launch date of no earlier than 7 February 2016, the SpaceX CRS-8 mission provided the ISS with the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module. Two EVAs were performed during Expedition 46. He returned to Earth on Soyuz TMA-19M, and landed on 18 June 2016 09:15 UTC, after spending additional 186 days in space.

<doc id="405403" wikidata="Q337864" url="?curid=405403" title="Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester">
<text>Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester PC, PC (Ire), FRS (28 April 1756 – 4 July 1826), styled The Honourable Thomas Pelham from 1768 until 1783, The Right Honourable Thomas Pelham from 1783 to 1801, and then known as Lord Pelham until 1805, was a British Whig politician. He notably held office as Home Secretary under Henry Addington from 1801 to 1803.

==Background and education==
Chichester was the eldest son of Thomas Pelham, 1st Earl of Chichester, and his wife Anne, daughter of Frederick Meinhardt Frankland. The Right Reverend George Pelham was his younger brother. He was educated at Westminster and Clare College, Cambridge.

==Political career==
Pelham was commissioned as a captain in the Sussex Militia when it was raised by the Duke of Richmond in June 1778, and was subsequently promoted to major and lieutenant-colonel, frequently deputising in command for Richmond. During the summer of 1780 the regiment was at Ranmore Camp near Dorking in Surrey, close enough to Sussex for Pelham to stand as a candidate for the county in the general election and to be elected.

Chichester was appointed Surveyor-General of the Ordnance under the Duke of Richmond as Master-General of the Ordnance in Lord Rockingham&#x27;s second ministry (1782), and Chief Secretary for Ireland in the coalition ministry of 1783 (when he was also appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland). He represented Carrick in the Irish House of Commons from 1783 to 1790 and Clogher from 1795 to 1797. In 1795 he was sworn of the Privy Council and became Irish chief secretary under Pitt&#x27;s government, retiring in 1798.

In the latter year he sat briefly for Naas before transferring to Armagh Borough, a seat he held only until the next year. He was Home Secretary from July 1801 to August 1803 under Addington, who made him Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1803. Pelham went out of office in 1804, and in the next year succeeded to the earldom. He was joint-Postmaster General from 1807 to 1823, and for the remaining three years of his life Postmaster General.

==Family==

Lord Chichester married Lady Mary Henrietta Juliana, daughter of Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds, in 1801. They had four sons and six daughters. Their second son, the Hon. Frederick Thomas Pelham, was a naval commander, while their third son, the Right Reverend John Thomas Pelham, was Bishop of Norwich. Lord Chichester died in July 1826, aged 70, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Henry. His daughter Lady Amelia Rose married Major General Sir Joshua Jebb, the Surveyor General of Prisons and designer of Pentonville Prison, the &#x27;Model Prison&#x27;, on 5 September 1854. The Countess of Chichester died in October 1862, aged 86.
His daughter, Lady Lucy Anne Pelham, married Sir David Dundas.

<doc id="405405" wikidata="Q1216187" url="?curid=405405" title="Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)">
<text>Beauty and the Beast is an American fantasy drama television series that first aired on CBS from September 25, 1987 to August 4, 1990. Creator Ron Koslow&#x27;s updated version of the fairy tale has a double focus: the relationship between Vincent (Ron Perlman), a mythic, noble man-beast, and Catherine (Linda Hamilton), a savvy Assistant District Attorney in New York City, as well as a secret utopian community of social outcasts living in a subterranean sanctuary. Through an empathic bond, Vincent senses Catherine&#x27;s emotions and becomes her guardian.

==Premise==
The series follows the developing relationship between the main characters and explores the division between New York City and a hidden, subterranean world. In a twist on the original fairy tale, however, the &quot;beast&quot; does not transform into society’s ideal of beauty after winning Catherine’s love. Instead, Vincent’s inner beauty remains the defining feature of his character, while Catherine’s life is transformed by her relationship with him.

In the third season, after the death of the character Catherine, Jo Anderson became the new female lead playing Diana Bennett, a criminal profiler investigating Catherine&#x27;s murder.

==Production==
As the title indicates, the premise of the series is inspired by the fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;; in particular, there is some connection to the Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1946 French film, &quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot;.

George R. R. Martin, who would later write the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; book series which were later adapted into the acclaimed television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, was a writer and producer on the show.

In 2004 and 2007, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was ranked #14 and #17, respectively, on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Top Cult Shows Ever.

==Series synopsis==
===Season 1===
Catherine Chandler (played by Linda Hamilton) is abducted, beaten, slashed and left to die in Central Park because she was inadvertently mistaken for somebody else. She is rescued and cared for by Vincent (played by Ron Perlman) who has taken her to Father (played by Roy Dotrice), head of a hidden community of people dwelling in tunnels below the city of New York. Ten days later, Catherine returns to the surface with the promise of keeping Vincent&#x27;s secret and the challenge to go on after her terrible attack. After completing her recovery, her life begins a serious transition: she takes self-defense lessons, leaves her comfortable job at her father&#x27;s law firm and joins the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s office as an assistant district attorney. Her first action involves her asking Carol Stabler about those men who attacked her, where she states that they were part of an illegal escort service run by Martin Belmont. When Catherine is attacked by Martin Belmont&#x27;s men, she is saved by Vincent, who mauls the men.

During the course of the first season, the production team fashioned a blend of romance and crime drama, which used both Catherine&#x27;s position as an ADA and her will to help Vincent and his world to place her in moments of physical danger that would bring the idealized romantic figure of Vincent to the surface world as her guardian angel.

===Season 2===
During its second season, the series shifted its focus slightly to add more character development, as the central characters spent considerable time exploring their relationships with the inhabitants of the Tunnel World, where Catherine had finally been accepted as a friend and &quot;Helper&quot; (someone who assists the Tunnel community with what they need to survive and by keeping their secret). More people from the World Above turned up for emotional support and healing in the secure environment of the World Below.

Near the end of the season, however, in an effort to boost faltering ratings, the action orientation returned as a result of the misleadings of the recurrent villain Paracelsus (played by Tony Jay). In a cliffhanger final episode, Catherine is seen walking down a tunnel into a chamber, where Vincent is suffering from a violent madness.

===Season 3===
When the series returned for its abbreviated third season late in 1989, Linda Hamilton had announced her decision to leave the series as she was pregnant at the time. It was a decision that, along with the network&#x27;s desire to attract more male viewers, would have serious repercussions for the show&#x27;s continued survival. In the resolution to the previous season&#x27;s cliffhanger, Catherine rescued Vincent from his inner demons but was kidnapped by a man named Gabriel (played by Stephen McHattie), the ruthless head of a huge criminal empire she had been investigating, which was trying to corrupt the D.A.&#x27;s office. She was killed, but not before giving birth to Vincent&#x27;s son, who was held hostage by the evil Gabriel. Catherine&#x27;s boss and close friend Joe Maxwell (Jay Acovone) hired Diana Bennett (Jo Anderson), a criminal profiler with the police department, to track down Catherine&#x27;s killer. Quite naturally, her investigation ultimately led her to the now darkly obsessed and grieving Vincent.

Although still popular with its dedicated fans, the darker, more resolutely violent aspects of the reworked concept, coupled with the fatal loss of the all-important central relationship between Catherine and Vincent, led to further declining ratings and, ultimately, cancellation.

==Characters==
===Main cast===

*Catherine Chandler (portrayed by Linda Hamilton) – A corporate attorney in her father&#x27;s law firm. After she was abducted, beaten and her face slashed upon being mistaken for Carol Stabler, Catherine was rescued and tended to by Vincent. After that experience, Catherine changes her life completely and becomes an investigator for the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s Office. In Season Three, Catherine becomes pregnant with Vincent&#x27;s child and is captured by Gabriel. She is later murdered by Gabriel who has his &quot;tame&quot; doctor overdose her with morphine.
*Vincent (portrayed by Ron Perlman) – A man of extremely large build with the facial characteristics of a lion, such as fanged teeth, a flattened nose, a feline muzzle and fingers tipped with claw-like nails. He is also much stronger than normal humans and when enraged, he growls and roars like a lion. He wears a hooded cloak to hide his appearance from strangers while walking the city streets at night. His parentage is unknown as he was found as a baby near St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital and brought to Jacob Wells by Paracelsus&#x27; wife, Anna. Vincent has empathic abilities that let him know when Catherine is in danger. Following the death of Catherine, his new-born son was captive in the clutches of Gabriel prompting him to take down Gabriel&#x27;s operations. He does end up surrendering to Gabriel when he hears that his son is ill. This leads up to a rescue mission by Diana and the rest of the &quot;World Below&quot;. Following the death of Gabriel, Vincent saves his son and names him after his foster father, Jacob. Vincent&#x27;s makeup was devised by veteran Hollywood makeup artist Rick Baker. It was Baker who brought up Perlman based on his previous experiences in prosthetics and fought hard for his casting which ultimately started a long-lasting friendship between the two. Matt McColm was a stunt double for Perlman.
*Diana Bennett (portrayed by Jo Anderson) – Diana is a criminal profiler with the &quot;210 Division&quot; of the New York City Police Department, which investigates unusual cases beyond the scope of the normal police. She debuted in Season 3, where she was called to investigate Catherine&#x27;s murder. She later becomes a friend of the &quot;World Below&quot; and plays a part in the final battle against Gabriel, fatally shooting him with Catherine&#x27;s gun.

===&quot;World Above&quot;===
*Joe Maxwell (portrayed by Jay Acovone) – A Deputy District attorney for the Borough of Manhattan and Catherine&#x27;s immediate superior in the office. In Season Three, Joe is injured in a car explosion caused by Gabriel&#x27;s crime syndicate. After the murder of Catherine and the death of District Attorney John Moreno, Joe becomes Acting District Attorney and hires Diana Bennett to find her killer. Joe later meets Jacob Wells when it comes to tracking down Gabriel, but he never meets Vincent.
*Isaac Stubbs (portrayed by Ron O&#x27;Neal in &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, Delroy Lindo in &quot;Terrible Savior&quot; and &quot;No Way Down&quot;) – A street-fighting instructor who teaches Catherine to defend herself after she recovers from her attack.
*Jenny Aronson (portrayed by Terri Hanauer) – A friend of Catherine&#x27;s.
*Edie (portrayed by Ren Woods) – Works in the computer division of the DA&#x27;s office in Season 1.
*Elliot Burch (portrayed by Edward Albert) – A self-made millionaire and New York building developer who is in love with Catherine. In Season Three, Elliot becomes familiar with Vincent after an encounter with him. Due to a deal with Gabriel, Elliot is involved in a plot to kill Vincent on his boat. Elliot is presumably killed by the boat explosion which wounded Vincent.
*Charles Chandler (portrayed by John McMartin) – Catherine&#x27;s father who is seen in Season 1 and 2 where he runs a law firm that Catherine used to work at. He dies of a stroke in the episode &quot;Orphans&quot;. Before Charles died, Catherine was able to have Vincent meet her father.
*Laura Williams (portrayed by Terrylene Sacchetti) – A deaf girl who lived in &quot;The World Below&quot; and struggles living in &quot;The World Above&quot; while remaining a helper to her tunnel family and befriending Catherine whom she admires.
*Devin Wells (portrayed by Bruce Abbott) – A former inhabitant of &quot;The World Below&quot; who grew up with Vincent where they had a brother-like relationship.
*Dr. Peter Alcott (portrayed by Joseph Campanella) – A &quot;Helper&quot; who is a fellow medical student and old friend of Jacob Wells. In &quot;Dead of Winter&quot;, Peter is among the &quot;Helpers&quot; that attend Winterfest.
*John Moreno (portrayed by Bill Marcus) – The District Attorney that Catherine Chandler and Joe Maxwell work for. In Season Three, it is revealed that he is one of Gabriel&#x27;s minions and betrays Catherine. He is later killed by Vincent in self-defense while trying to kill both Vincent and Elliot Burch.
*Gabriel (portrayed by Stephen McHattie) – A highly-influential crime boss and the biggest drug trafficker on the East Coast who debuted in Season 3 as a recurring antagonist. He was responsible for Catherine&#x27;s death and the kidnapping of her new-born son, Jacob. After Gabriel&#x27;s men captured Diana, Vincent surrendered himself to Gabriel&#x27;s men. In the final battle, Vincent&#x27;s son is rescued as Vincent wounds Gabriel. After Gabriel mentions that no court would be able to convict him, Diana avenges Catherine&#x27;s death by killing him with Catherine&#x27;s gun.
**Jonathan Pope (portrayed by John Lehne) – Gabriel&#x27;s right-hand man, who issues out Gabriel&#x27;s orders.
**Doctor (portrayed by Kenneth Kimmins) – An unnamed doctor, who works for Gabriel. He forced the doctor to inject Catherine with a fatal dose of morphine following her giving birth to Vincent&#x27;s son, Jacob. When Gabriel revealed this to Vincent at the time when he was his prisoner, he offered Vincent vengeance on the doctor (even though the doctor had stated to Vincent that Gabriel had forced him do it). Vincent was unable to take the doctor&#x27;s life, causing Gabriel to have one of his men shoot the doctor as Gabriel says to Vincent, &quot;I always pay my debts&quot;.

===&quot;World Below&quot;===

*Jacob Wells/Father (portrayed by Roy Dotrice) – The patriarch of the &quot;World Below&quot; and Vincent&#x27;s foster father. A physician who left the &quot;World Above&quot; after being unjustly blacklisted, fired from his job and having his license to practice medicine stripped from him, Jacob found sanctuary in an early tunnel community and became its leader. He was also the one who helped Vincent heal Catherine after she was attacked by Martin Belmont&#x27;s men.
*Mary (portrayed by Ellen Geer) – The matriarch and midwife of the &quot;World Below&quot;. Befitting her position, she is very motherly and generous. Mary is particularly devoted to giving back to the &quot;Helpers&quot;.
*Mouse (portrayed by David Greenlee) – Apparently having no other name, at least none that he remembers, he is a young tunnel dweller who originally hid from the &quot;World Below&quot; community, until Vincent caught him stealing some food and invited him into their family. He is infamous for stealing from the &quot;World Above&quot;, which in his opinion, exists for no other reason than to be stolen from as he once commented &quot;Everyone takes things from Up Top. It&#x27;s what Up Top is there for&quot;. Mouse loves tinkering with machinery and has invented several &quot;gizmos&quot; to help his fellow tunnel dwellers. He has a pet raccoon, named Arthur.
*Pascal (portrayed by Armin Shimerman) – The shy and gentle &quot;pipe master&quot; who is the supervisor of the tunnels&#x27; communication system that involves the inhabitants of &quot;The World Below&quot; speaking through banging on the pipes. He was born in the &quot;World Below&quot; and was trained into understanding morse code by his father.
*Winslow (portrayed by James Avery) – A very influential member of the underground community and a member of Jacob Wells&#x27; council. Winslow is a blacksmith by trade. When on a rescue mission with Vincent to save Catherine from Paracelsus in &quot;To Reign in Hell&quot;, Winslow is killed by Paracelsus&#x27; minion Erlik, who threw Winslow against the wall.
*Geoffrey (portrayed by Philip Waller) – A young boy who lives in the &quot;World Below&quot;.
*Jamie (portrayed by Irina Irvine) – A teenage girl who lives in the &quot;World Below&quot;. She is particularly protective of Mouse, defending his often erratic behavior to their elders. In &quot;To Reign in Hell&quot;, Jamie is shown to be skillful with a crossbow when she uses it in a fight with Paracelsus&#x27; minion Erlik.
*Narcissa (portrayed by Beah Richards) – An elderly and nearly blind inhabitant of the &quot;World Below&quot;, she has resided there at least as far back as Vincent&#x27;s childhood. Narcissa eventually moved far from the other inhabitants into the furthest tunnels where few others venture and even Vincent&#x27;s knowledge of these areas does not surpass her own. She pretends to be nothing more than a senile old woman, but she is actually a skilled magician and fortune teller.
*Rebecca (portrayed Kathryn Spitz) – A female inhabitant of the &quot;World Below&quot; and an expert candlestick maker.
*William (portrayed by Ritch Brinkley) – A heavyset man and inhabitant of the &quot;World Below&quot; who serves as their cook. His experiences in the &quot;World Above&quot; left him bitter and suspicious of almost everyone. William&#x27;s role as cook makes him feel needed and appreciated as the &quot;World Above&quot; never did and he is usually the first to suggest a violent response to any threat to the &quot;World Below&quot;.
*John Pater/Paracelsus (portrayed by Tony Jay) – An inhabitant of the &quot;World Below&quot; who was featured in Season 1 and 2 as a recurring antagonist. John Pater was a scientist and a former friend of Jacob Wells&#x27; who helped organize the &quot;World Below&quot;. But when he eventually desired power for himself, the community was forced to exile him. Jacob describes him as a &quot;philosopher, scientist, magician&quot; like the real Paracelsus, the name John eventually takes for himself. When Jacob tries to reason with Paracelsus by calling him by his real name, he commented &quot;John is dead&quot;. Paracelsus&#x27; late wife, Anna was the one who had discovered the infant Vincent near St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital and brought him to Jacob. Paracelsus tried to lead Vincent to siding with him while disguised as Jacob, but was ultimately killed by Vincent in a fit of rage. In his dying breath, Paracelsus quotes &quot;At last, you are my son&quot;.

<doc id="405406" wikidata="Q2307548" url="?curid=405406" title="Ceiba, Puerto Rico">
<text>Ceiba () is both a small town and a municipality in northeast Puerto Rico. It is named after the famous Ceiba tree. Ceiba is located in the north-east coast of the island, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, south of Fajardo, north of Naguabo and southeast of Río Grande. Located about one hour&#x27;s driving distance from San Juan, Ceiba is spread over 7 barrios and Ceiba Pueblo (the downtown area and administrative center). It is part of the Fajardo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Ceiba was founded on April 7, 1838 by Luis de la Cruz. Ceiba derives its name from an Indian word Seyba, which is the name for a famous tree that grows in the island, &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;, the kapok tree.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico and the population numbers of Ceiba were consolidated with the population numbers of Fajardo.

Ceiba, situated near Fajardo, used to be home of an American military Naval base, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. Most of the units were relocated and the base was closed in 2004. Ex-governor Sila María Calderón suggested turning the property into a major international airport, to serve as a relief to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, and to increase the number of international airlines that operate into Puerto Rico. She was met with skepticism about these plans from such groups as environmentalists, economists and others, but in 2008, José Aponte de la Torre Airport was inaugurated at the base&#x27;s former site.

Locals are commonly known as &quot;Los Come Sopa&quot; (Spanish for &#x27;the soup-eaters&#x27;). Even though there is no official reason as to why they are called this, a few stories have been suggested. Among the tales is the belief that since the town did not have a local meat market people had to travel long distances in order to buy some meat and therefore mostly ate soup. 

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Ceiba. Forty-nine structures in Punta Figuera were destroyed completely. In July 2018, some residents received monies via FEMA to rebuild their homes.

==Geography==
The &quot;Reserva Natural Medio Mundo y Daguao&quot; (Nature Reserve Medio Mundo and Daguao) extends along the coastline between Ceiba and Fajardo. 95% of the forest is classified as mangrove. Various species of birds can be seen as well as turtles and manatees. Its rivers includes; Río Daguao, Río Demajagua and Río Fajardo.

The municipality extends northwest into the seas between Fajardo and Culebra and thereby includes the reefs and islets named Arrecifes Hermanos and Arrecifes Barriles. The reef are closest to the coastal &quot;barrio&quot; of Machos, but barrio boundaries are not defined in that area.

<text>Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College () is a sixth form college, located in Leicester, England. The college is led by Paul Wilson who was appointed the eighth principal in March 2018. The college merged with the nearby Regent College in 2018 to form an institution with approximately 3,750 full-time 16–18-year-old students and 140 teaching staff. More than 40 subjects are offered at A Level.

The college was awarded Learning and Skills Beacon Status in April 2003.

==History==

The college, which has over 3,750 students, was founded in 1976 following a (comprehensive) re-organisation of secondary education in the city. Many other parts of rural Leicestershire had gone comprehensive in 1968.

The college now occupies a site adjoining Victoria Park and the University of Leicester that was previously occupied by Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys (also known as Wyggeston Boys&#x27; School).

The school takes the Wyggeston name from the former school and from Wyggeston Grammar School for Girls, which both closed in the 1970s.

In 1976 the site of the former girls&#x27; school became Wyggeston Collegiate Sixth Form College, known as Regent College between 1996 and 2018, when it merged with Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College.

==Principals==
*Dr G A Thompson – 1978-1994 (also head of the former grammar school from 1968)
*Dr Robert Wilkinson – 1994-2002
*Ian Wilson – 2002–2012
*Sandra Hamilton-Fox - 2012–2016
*Paul Wilson – 2018–present

==Curriculum==
Courses including AS, A2 and GCSEs are provided at the College. The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma was introduced in September 2006 with 33 students opting for this alternative. The last cohort of the IB completed the course in 2012, and the programme is no longer offered.

===Academic performance===
In 2006 the A Level pass rate was 98 per cent with 45 per cent at grades A and B. About 90% of students progress to higher education, mostly in the Midlands region.

==Notable former students==

* H.E. Atkins Leading British chess player from 1905 to 1925.
* Richard Attenborough Actor and film director
* David Attenborough British broadcaster, biologist and natural historian
* Bali Rai, novelist
* Ben Youngs, Rugby Union player for England and Leicester Tigers
* Shivani Raja, Member of Parliament

<doc id="405411" wikidata="Q696438" url="?curid=405411" title="Naval Battle of Guadalcanal">
<text>The Naval Battle of Guadalcanal took place from 12 to 15 November 1942 and was the decisive engagement in a series of naval battles between Allied (primarily American) and Imperial Japanese forces during the months-long Guadalcanal campaign in the Solomon Islands during World War II. The action consisted of combined air and sea engagements over four days, most near Guadalcanal and all related to a Japanese effort to reinforce land forces on the island. The only two U.S. Navy admirals to be killed in a surface engagement in the war were lost in this battle.

Allied forces landed on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield, later called Henderson Field, that was under construction by the Japanese military. There were several subsequent attempts to recapture the airfield by the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship, efforts which ultimately failed. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. Several Japanese warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field with the goal of destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal.

In the resulting battle, both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night. Nevertheless, the U.S. succeeded in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan&#x27;s last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor. The Japanese decided on the evacuation of Guadalcanal the following month, which they completed by early February 1943.

Guadalcanal was the last major naval battle in the Pacific War for the next one-and-a-half years, until the Battle of the Philippine Sea. It was one of the costliest naval battles of the Second World War in terms of lives lost.

==Background==
The six-month Guadalcanal campaign began on 7 August 1942, when Allied (primarily U.S.) forces landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands, a pre-war colonial possession of Great Britain. The landings were meant to prevent the Japanese using the islands as bases from which to threaten the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major Imperial Japanese military base at Rabaul, and to support the Allied New Guinea campaign. The Japanese had occupied Tulagi in May 1942 and began constructing an airfield on Guadalcanal in June 1942.

By nightfall on 8 August, the 11,000 Allied troops secured Tulagi, the nearby small islands, and a Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal (later renamed Henderson Field). Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the &quot;Cactus Air Force&quot; (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point to more than 20,000 men.

In response, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s 17th Army, a corps-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant-General Harukichi Hyakutake, with the task of retaking Guadalcanal. Units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on 19 August to drive Allied forces from the island.

Because of the threat posed by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, they used warships based at Rabaul and the Shortland Islands. The Japanese warships—mainly light cruisers or destroyers from the Eighth Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa—were usually able to make the round trip down &quot;The Slot&quot; to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner prevented most of the soldiers&#x27; heavy equipment and supplies—such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition—from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high-speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and came to be known as the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; by Allied forces and &quot;Rat Transportation&quot; by the Japanese.
The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on 21 August in the Battle of the Tenaru. The next attempt took place from 12 to 14 September, ending in the defeat of the 6,000 men under the command of Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi at the Battle of Edson&#x27;s Ridge.

In October, the Japanese again tried to recapture Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more men—mainly from the Army&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Division—to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering the troops and their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling the approach of the transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on 14 October that heavily damaged the airfield&#x27;s runways, destroyed half of the CAF&#x27;s aircraft, and burned most of the available aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service, and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its prebombardment level over the next few weeks.

The next Imperial attempt to retake the island with the newly arrived troops occurred from 20 to 26 October and was defeated with heavy losses in the Battle for Henderson Field. At the same time, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (the commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet) engaged U.S. naval forces in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, which resulted in a tactical victory for the Japanese. However, the Americans won a strategic victory as the Japanese navy failed in its objectives and the Japanese carriers were forced to retreat because of losses to carrier aircraft and aircrewmen. Thereafter, Yamamoto&#x27;s ships returned to their main bases at Truk in Micronesia, where he had his headquarters, and Rabaul while three carriers returned to Japan for repairs and refitting.

The Japanese Army planned another attack on Guadalcanal in November 1942, but further reinforcements were needed before the operation could proceed. The Army requested assistance from Yamamoto to deliver the needed reinforcements to the island and to support their planned offensive on the Allied forces guarding Henderson Field. Yamamoto provided 11 large transport ships to carry 7,000 army troops from the 38th Infantry Division, their ammunition, food, and heavy equipment from Rabaul to Guadalcanal. He also sent a warship support force from Truk on 9 November which included the battleships and . Equipped with special fragmentation shells, they were to bombard Henderson Field on the night of 12–13 November and destroy it and the aircraft stationed there in order to allow the slow, heavy transports to reach Guadalcanal and unload safely the next day. The warship force was commanded from &quot;Hiei&quot; by recently promoted Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe.

Because of the constant threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships, it was difficult for Allied forces to resupply their forces on Guadalcanal, which often came under attack from Imperial land and sea forces in the area. In early November 1942, Allied intelligence learned that the Japanese were preparing again to try to retake Henderson Field. Therefore, the U.S. sent Task Force 67 (TF 67)—a large reinforcement and re-supply convoy, split into two groups and commanded by Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner—to Guadalcanal on 11 November. The supply ships were protected by two task groups—commanded by Rear Admirals Daniel J. Callaghan and Norman Scott—and aircraft from Henderson Field. The transport ships were attacked several times on 11 and 12 November near Guadalcanal by Japanese aircraft based at Buin, but most were unloaded without serious damage. Twelve Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the U.S. ships or by fighter aircraft flying from Henderson Field. Callaghan&#x27;s flagship, , was heavily damaged during this air raid when a large twin-engined Japanese &quot;Betty&quot; medium bomber, which was in flames from anti-aircraft fire, crashed into the backup conning tower (Battle II) of &quot;San Francisco&quot;. 24 men were killed and 45 were wounded, including the heavily wounded executive officer, Commander Mark H. Crouter, who had to abandon his post and was recovering in his quarters and killed during the later night surface action. Survivors of &quot;San Francisco&quot; said that the heavy damage, which included damage to radar and fire control equipment stationed at the backup conning tower, and the loss of so many officers and men greatly hindered their ability to command and perform optimally during the night battle. The destroyer was also heavily damaged in the air attack. Due to the low-flying Japanese torpedo bombers that forced American sailors to fire their anti-aircraft weapons in the direction of friendly ships &quot;Buchanan&quot; was hit by a 5-inch shell from a U.S. ship that heavily damaged her after stack and also completely disabled her torpedo tubes. The friendly fire killed 5 crewmen and wounded seven on &quot;Buchanan&quot; and forced her to retire from the area to undergo major repairs that lasted three months. A Japanese bomber&#x27;s tail gunner also caused minor damage on her with his machine gun, wounding one more sailor. This hurt Callaghan&#x27;s forces because &quot;Buchanan&quot; was the destroyer that was able to successfully fire torpedoes that permanently disabled and sank the heavy cruiser at the Battle of Cape Esperance, the first American sinking of a large Japanese warship due to surface ships.

==First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 13 November==

===Prelude===

Abe&#x27;s warship force assembled north of Indispensable Strait and proceeded towards Guadalcanal on 12 November with an estimated arrival time for the warships of early morning of 13 November. The convoy of slower transport ships and 12 escorting destroyers, under the command of Raizō Tanaka, began its run down The Slot from the Shortlands with an estimated arrival time at Guadalcanal during the night of 13 November.

Abe&#x27;s force consisted of:

(d = damaged; D = crippled; S = sunk; s = sunk soon after)

: 2 fast battleships
:: 2 (8 × 14-in. main battery): (), 
: 1 light cruiser
:: (7 × 5.5-in. main battery): 
: 11 destroyers
:: 2 (6 × 5-in. main battery): (d), 
:: 1 (6 × 5-in. main battery): 
:: 4 (5 × 5-in. main battery): , (d), , ()
:: 3 (6 × 5-in. main battery): (d), , ()
:: 1 (8 × 3.9-in. main battery): 

Three more destroyers (, , and ) would provide a rear guard in the Russell Islands during Abe&#x27;s foray into the waters of Savo Sound around and near Savo Island off the north coast of Guadalcanal that would soon be nicknamed &quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot; as a result of the numerous ships sunk in this succession of battles and skirmishes. U.S. reconnaissance aircraft spotted the approach of the Japanese ships and passed a warning to the Allied command. Thus warned, Turner detached all usable combat ships to protect the troops ashore from the expected Japanese naval attack and troop landing and ordered the supply ships at Guadalcanal to depart by the early evening of 12 November. Callaghan was a few days senior to the more experienced Scott and therefore was placed in overall command.

Callaghan prepared his force to meet the Japanese that night in the sound. His force consisted of:

: 2 heavy cruisers
:: 1 (9 × 8-in. main battery): (D)
:: 1 (9 × 8-in. main battery): (D)
: 1 light cruiser
:: 1 (15 × 6-in. rapid fire main battery): 
: 2 anti-aircraft light cruisers
:: 2 (16 × 5-in. dual purpose main battery): (), ()
: 8 destroyers
:: 2 (5 × 5-in. dual purpose main battery): , 
:: 2 (5 × 5-in. dual purpose main battery): (D), ()
:: 2 (4 × 5-in. dual purpose main battery): (), ()
:: 1 (4 × 5-in. main battery): (D)
:: 1 (5 × 5-in. main battery): ()

Admiral Callaghan commanded from &quot;San Francisco&quot;.

During their approach to Guadalcanal, the Japanese force passed through a large and intense rain squall which, along with a complex formation plus some confusing orders from Abe, split the formation into several groups. The U.S. force steamed in a single column in Ironbottom Sound, with destroyers in the lead and rear of the column, and the cruisers in the center. Five ships had the new, far-superior SG radar, but Callaghan&#x27;s deployment put none of them in the forward part of the column, nor did he choose one for his flagship. Callaghan did not issue a battle plan to his ship commanders.

===Action===
====Confused approach====
At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete darkness due to the bad weather and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the Slot but from the west side of Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises, which helped them in the pending encounter, as well as in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.

Several of the U.S. ships detected the approaching Japanese on radar, beginning at about 01:24, but had trouble communicating the information to Callaghan because of problems with radio equipment, lack of discipline regarding communications procedures, and general inexperience in operating as a cohesive naval unit. Messages were sent and received but did not reach the commander in time to be processed and used. With his limited understanding of the new technology, Callaghan wasted further time trying to reconcile the range and bearing information reported by radar with his limited sight picture. The radar operator was reporting on vessels that were not in sight, while Callaghan was trying to coordinate the battle visually from the bridge. Due to the earlier de facto &quot;kamikaze&quot; strike on the after superstructure of &quot;San Francisco&quot;, Callaghan and skipper Captain Cassin Young, who had just begun his first ever command of a cruiser four days earlier on 9 November, had to work with a new acting executive officer, who was actually the damage control commanding officer, stationed at his new heavily damaged backup command post for less than twelve hours, where the radar and fire control here were inoperable. Post battle analysis of this and other early surface actions would lead directly to the introduction of the modern combat information center (CIC), where incoming information could be quickly processed and coordinated, early in 1943.

Several minutes after initial radar contact the two forces sighted each other at about the same time, but both Abe and Callaghan hesitated ordering their ships into action. Abe was apparently surprised by the proximity of the U.S. ships, and with decks stacked with San Shiki special bombardment (rather than armor penetrating) munitions, he was momentarily uncertain if he should withdraw to give his battleships time to rearm, or continue onward. He decided to continue onward. Callaghan apparently intended to attempt to cross the T of the Japanese, as Scott had done at Cape Esperance, but—confused by the incomplete information he was receiving, plus the fact that the Japanese formation consisted of several scattered groups—he gave several confusing orders on ship movements and delayed too long in acting.

The U.S. ship formation began to fall apart, apparently further delaying Callaghan&#x27;s order to commence firing as he first tried to ascertain and align his ships&#x27; positions. Meanwhile, the two forces&#x27; formations began to overlap as individual ship commanders on both sides anxiously awaited permission to open fire.

====&quot;Akatsuki&quot; and &quot;Atlanta&quot; receive the opening blows====

At 01:48, &quot;Akatsuki&quot; and &quot;Hiei&quot; turned on large searchlights and illuminated &quot;Atlanta&quot; only away—almost point-blank range for the battleship&#x27;s main guns. Several ships on both sides spontaneously began firing, and the formations of the two adversaries quickly disintegrated. Realizing that his force was almost surrounded by Japanese ships, Callaghan issued the confusing order, &quot;Odd ships fire to starboard, even ships fire to port,&quot; though no pre-battle planning had assigned any such identity numbers to reference and the ships were no longer in coherent formation. Most of the remaining U.S. ships then opened fire although several had to quickly change their targets to attempt to comply with Callaghan&#x27;s order. As the ships from the two sides intermingled, they battled each other in an utterly confused and chaotic short-range mêlée in which superior Japanese optic sights and well-practiced night battle drill proved deadly effective. Indeed, the battle was so close quarters that in the opening stages, the lead American destroyer, USS &quot;Cushing&quot;, almost collided with the destroyers &quot;Yūdachi&quot; and &quot;Harusame&quot;, with both sides turning to avoid each other. An officer on &quot;Monssen&quot; likened it afterwards to &quot;a barroom brawl after the lights had been shot out&quot;.

At least six of the U.S. ships—including &quot;Laffey&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot;, &quot;Atlanta&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Portland&quot;, and &quot;Helena&quot;—fired at &quot;Akatsuki&quot;, which had drawn attention to herself with her illuminated searchlight. &quot;Akatsuki&quot; quickly responded with gunfire, scoring 5-inch (127 mm) shell hits that disabled &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s&quot; port torpedo tubes right as they were about to be fired. However, &quot;Akatsuki&quot; received far more damage than she inflicted. Resulting gunfire damage from the six ships set her on fire before even a single torpedo could be fired, resulting in the destroyer blowing up and sinking within a few minutes.

Perhaps because she was the lead cruiser in the U.S. formation, &quot;Atlanta&quot; was immediately targeted by &quot;Hiei&quot;, which fired a single full salvo from her main guns, hitting &quot;Atlanta&quot; with either seven or all eight 14-inch (356 mm) shells fired, setting the cruiser on fire, disabling her aft guns, and killing Admiral Scott and most of his staff. &quot;Nagara&quot; also fired on &quot;Atlanta&quot;, hitting her many times, and simultaneously &quot;Ikazuchi&quot; and &quot;Inazuma&quot; swerved to firing range, &quot;Ikazuchi&quot; evading the burning wreck of &quot;Akatsuki&quot;, and each fired six torpedoes. Atlanta took some 35 shell hits, leaving her badly crippled but not sinking, but that changed when the final blow was delivered as two of &quot;Ikazuchi&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes made their mark. One was a dud, but the other exploded and cut all power to &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s&quot; engineering spaces. The disabled cruiser drifted into the line of fire of &quot;San Francisco&quot;, which accidentally fired on her, hitting her with nineteen 8-inch (203 mm) shells, though all passed through the superstructure without exploding. Without power and unable to fire her guns, &quot;Atlanta&quot; drifted out of control and out of the battle as the Japanese ships passed her by, leading to her eventual scuttling.

&quot;Cushing&quot;, having recovered from her near collision, fired her guns at &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; and attempted to sink her. However, her shots were badly aimed and failed to damage their target. In turn, &quot;Cushing&quot; was ambushed by &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and &quot;Teruzuki&quot; which fired their guns at a mere 3,000 yards. &quot;Cushing&quot; attempted to turn attention to her attackers, but 5-inch (127 mm) and 3.9-inch (10 cm) shell hits quickly destroyed all electrical power, all engine power, and disabled her guns, fatal damage that led to her being eventually abandoned and left to sink. Blasted into a floating wreck by over 20 shell hits and lit up by a massive fire in just one minute, &quot;Cushing&quot; could only respond with machine gunfire, which managed to kill a sailor on &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; deck but otherwise caused only cosmetic damage. As the defenseless &quot;Cushing&quot; drifted away from the battle, her sailors watched as the massive &quot;Hiei&quot; sailed right past them. In turn, after helping to sink &quot;Atlanta&quot;, &quot;Ikazuchi&quot; was fired on by &quot;Portland&quot; and hit by two 8-inch (203 mm) shells to her bow, starting a small fire and disabling her forward turret.

====Attention shifts to &quot;Hiei&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot; is mauled====

&quot;Hiei&quot;, with her nine lit searchlights, huge size, and course taking her directly through the U.S. formation, became the focus of gunfire from many of the U.S. ships. &quot;Portland&quot; fired on her and scored several hits with her main guns, while the back flotilla of US destroyers, &quot;Aaron Ward, Barton, Monssen&quot;, and &quot;Fletcher&quot; quickly closed the range to attack &quot;Hiei&quot;. Of the frontal destroyers, &quot;Sterett&quot; attacked &quot;Nagara&quot;, hitting her with one 5-inch (127 mm) shell, killing 6 men and causing minor damage while &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; was the first destroyer to attack &quot;Hiei&quot;, hitting her with several 5-inch (127 mm) shells and two torpedoes that failed to explode.

The destroyer &quot;Laffey&quot; evaded the burning &quot;Cushing&quot; and ran into a rain squall, and several minutes later discovered &quot;Hiei&quot; so close that they missed colliding by , only avoiding the collision by accelerating. &quot;Hiei&quot; was unable to depress her main or secondary batteries low enough to hit &quot;Laffey&quot;, but &quot;Laffey&quot; was able to rake the Japanese battleship with shells and machine gun fire, causing heavy damage to the superstructure and bridge, wounding Abe and killing his chief of staff, Captain Masakane Suzuki, alongside injuring and killing many others on the bridge. Abe was thus limited in his ability to direct his ships for the rest of the battle. &quot;Sterett&quot; then located &quot;Hiei&quot; and hit her several more times, helping to light &quot;Hiei&quot; on fire.
Unable to fire her main or secondary batteries at the three destroyers causing her so much trouble, &quot;Hiei&quot; instead concentrated on &quot;San Francisco&quot;, which was passing by only away. Along with &quot;Kirishima&quot;, &quot;Inazuma&quot;, and &quot;Ikazuchi&quot;, the four ships made repeated hits on &quot;San Francisco&quot;, disabling her steering control and killing Callaghan, Captain Cassin Young, and most of the bridge staff. The first few salvos from &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kirishima&quot; consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which caused less damage to the interior of &quot;San Francisco&quot; than armor-piercing shells would have done; this may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two Japanese battleships several minutes to switch to armor-piercing ammunition, and &quot;San Francisco&quot;, almost helpless to defend herself, managed to momentarily sail clear of the melee. In exchange, &quot;San Francisco&quot; hit &quot;Hiei&quot; with at least seventeen 8-inch (203 mm) shells during the brawl, one or two of which landed in &quot;Hiei&quot;″s steering gear room, flooding it with water, shorting out her power steering generators, and severely inhibiting &quot;Hiei&quot;″s steering capability. &quot;Helena&quot; followed &quot;San Francisco&quot; to try to protect her from further harm, in the process being hit by five 6-inch (152 mm) shells from &quot;Kirishima&quot; which caused minor damage, killing one sailor.

====Chaotic melee, IJN prevails====

Two of the U.S. destroyers met a sudden demise just before 2:00. &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; finally cleared the range into the battle, and immediately star shells fired from &quot;Nagara&quot; illuminated several destroyers peppering &quot;Hiei&quot; with gunfire. Commander Tameichi Hara ordered the destroyer to close to 3,000 yards, and upon the crew delivering this order &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; let out eight torpedoes at the enemy ships. Commander Hara had trained heavily as a torpedo warfare expert, and his knowledge paid off. &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; and &quot;Monssen&quot; barely avoided being torpedoed, maneuvering just in time. The destroyer &quot;Barton&quot; was not as lucky, she was forced to slow down to avoid colliding with &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;, and before she could pick up speed, two of &quot;Amatsukaze&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes slammed amidships, which tore &quot;Barton&quot; in half and sank her in a tremendous explosion of flames and steam.

&quot;Laffey&quot;, having escaped her encounter with &quot;Hiei&quot;, was suddenly located by &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and &quot;Teruzuki&quot; and illuminated by star shells&quot;.&quot; Immediately afterwards, one 14-inch (356 mm) shell from &quot;Hiei&quot; took revenge and hit the amidships superstructure, disabling her turret 3. &quot;Laffey&quot; responded with her remaining three guns, but before landing a hit one of &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes landed the crippling blow, blowing off &quot;Laffey&#x27;s&quot; stern, breaking her keel, destroying electrical power, and starting a gigantic fire. With flooding and fires quickly overwhelming damage control efforts, the abandon ship order was issued, and as &quot;Laffey&quot; was being abandoned, the fire caused by &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; torpedo hit ignited her turret 4 magazines and sank &quot;Laffey&quot; nearly instantly in a tremendous explosion.

&quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; while turning away from &quot;Hiei&quot; noticed the massive explosion caused by &quot;Laffey&#x27;s&quot; sinking and swerved to avoid colliding with her wreck, with &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s&quot; crew throwing some 50 lifejackets overboard to the surviving men in the water. As this happened, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; noticed &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; and fired away with her 5-inch (127 mm) guns. &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; turned away, and while no hits were landed a near miss detonated underneath the keel and temporarily disrupted &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s&quot; lighting and power. 

&quot;Portland was&quot; still firing on &quot;Hiei&quot; when she was hit by a torpedo from &quot;Inazuma&quot; or &quot;Ikazuchi&quot; which blew a 60 foot hole in the stern, jamming her rudder in a 5 degree turn to port and disabling her aft 8-inch (203 mm) gun turret. After completing her first loop, she was able to fire four salvos at &quot;Hiei&quot; but otherwise took little further part in the battle, while in turn &quot;Hiei&quot; hit &quot;Portland&quot; with two 14-inch (356 mm) shells that exploded upon impact with the belt. 

&quot;Yūdachi&quot; meanwhile was caught by the light cruiser &quot;Juneau&quot; and fired all eight torpedoes, but none hit. This put &quot;Yūdachi&quot; in a bad spot as she was forced to respond with only gunfire, but luckily &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, having just reloaded her torpedoes after sinking &quot;Barton&quot;, noticed her under fire and launched four torpedoes at the enemy cruiser. One of these torpedoes hit &quot;Juneau&quot; to the port side, cutting her speed to 13 knots, breaking her keel, and disabling electrical power, knocking the crippled &quot;Juneau&quot; out of the engagement.

Immediately afterwards, &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; nearly collided with the retreating &quot;San Francisco&quot;, and initially Commander Hara didn&#x27;t recognize the cruiser as an enemy warship due to the sheer number of deformities inflicted on her by &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kirishima&#x27;s&quot; gunfire. At just a few hundred yards away, &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; opened fire with her 5-inch (127 mm) guns, immediately scoring hits to &quot;San Francisco&#x27;s&quot; bridge, before a shell destroyed one of San Francisco&#x27;s remaining port 5-inch (127 mm) secondary guns and disabled the rest with shrapnel damage, killing several sailors. &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; then fired the last of her torpedoes, but due to how close they were, the torpedoes failed to arm and did not explode. However, &quot;Amatsukaze&#x27;s&quot; searchlights were not turned off quickly enough, allowing &quot;Helena&quot; to notice her, which then ambushed &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; and hit her with several 6-inch (152 mm) shells, disabling her guns and steering wheel and cutting her speed to 20 knots. However, &quot;Asagumo&quot;, &quot;Murasame&quot;, and &quot;Samidare&quot; finally joined the battle and intervened, taking up &quot;Helena&#x27;s&quot; attention as &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; withdrew from the battle. &quot;Helena&quot; hit &quot;Samidare&quot; with a shell that exploded in her bow and hit &quot;Murasame&quot; with a shell that knocked out her forward boiler, before the three destroyers each fired eight torpedoes and retreated. &quot;Murasame&quot; claimed to torpedo and sink &quot;Helena&quot;, which turned out to be a false claim as she survived without torpedo damage.

&quot;Monssen&quot; avoided the wreck of &quot;Barton&quot; and steamed onward looking for targets. She noticed what she thought were friendly ships signaling her, and signaled them back. Turns out, these were actually star shells as &quot;Asagumo&quot;, &quot;Murasame&quot;, and &quot;Samidare&quot; blasted &quot;Monssen&quot; to starboard, while &quot;Hiei&quot; flanked &quot;Monssen&quot; to port. In under two minutes, the Japanese ships hit &quot;Monssen&quot; some 39 times, including three 14-inch (356 mm) shells from &quot;Hiei&#x27;s&quot; main guns, smothering the destroyer into a floating wreck, fatal damage that resulted in &quot;Monssen&quot; sinking some 20 minutes later.

&quot;Aaron Ward&quot; and &quot;Sterett&quot;, independently searching for targets, both sighted &quot;Yūdachi&quot;, which appeared unaware of the approach of the two U.S. destroyers. Both U.S. ships hit &quot;Yūdachi&quot; simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, destroying her boilers and leaving her dead in the water, resulting in &quot;Yūdachi&quot; being abandoned. The ship did not sink right away, and stayed afloat after a failed scuttling attempt. Continuing on her way, &quot;Sterett&quot; was suddenly ambushed by &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, which hit &quot;Sterett&quot; with eleven 5-inch (127 mm) shells. &quot;Sterett&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes and aft guns were destroyed, and she was set on fire, but miraculously all damage was above the waterline, thus she did not sink and managed to limp away. &quot;Aaron Ward&quot; wound up in a one-on-one duel with &quot;Kirishima&quot;, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage, taking nine hits. She tried to retire from the battle area to the east but soon stopped dead in the water because the engines were damaged. In the final stages of the battle, intense flooding and fires inflicted near the very beginning of the engagement had finally overwhelmed all damage control on the still drifting and defenseless &quot;Cushing&quot;, and at 2:30 the destroyer was finally abandoned by her crew and left to sink several hours later.

Robert Leckie, a Marine private on Guadalcanal, described the battle:
The star shells rose, terrible and red. Giant tracers flashed across the night in orange arches. ... the sea seemed a sheet of polished obsidian on which the warships seemed to have been dropped and were immobilized, centered amid concentric circles like shock waves that form around a stone dropped in mud.

Ira Wolfert, an American war correspondent, was with the Marines on shore and wrote of the engagement:
The action was illuminated in brief, blinding flashes by Jap searchlights which were shot out as soon as they were turned on, by muzzle flashes from big guns, by fantastic streams of tracers, and by huge orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers and one of our destroyers blew up... From the beach it resembled a door to hell opening and closing ... over and over.

After nearly 40 minutes of brutal close-quarters fighting, the two sides broke contact and ceased fire at 02:26, after Abe and Captain Gilbert Hoover (the captain of &quot;Helena&quot; and senior surviving U.S. officer) ordered their respective forces to disengage. Abe had one battleship (&quot;Kirishima&quot;), one light cruiser (&quot;Nagara&quot;), and four destroyers (&quot;Asagumo&quot;, &quot;Teruzuki&quot;, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, and &quot;Harusame&quot;) with only light damage and four destroyers (&quot;Inazuma&quot;, &quot;Ikazuchi&quot;, &quot;Murasame&quot;, and &quot;Samidare&quot;) with moderate damage. The U.S. had only one light cruiser (&quot;Helena&quot;) and one destroyer (&quot;Fletcher&quot;) that were still capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear to Abe, the way was now open for him to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, thus allowing the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal. 

At this crucial juncture, Abe, like Mikawa before him and Kurita after him, chose to abandon the mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured as to why he made this decision. Much of the special bombardment ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, then his warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected Abe&#x27;s judgement. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged &quot;Hiei&quot;. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and &quot;Teruzuki&quot; remained behind to assist &quot;Hiei&quot;. &quot;Samidare&quot; picked up survivors from &quot;Yūdachi&quot; at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.

===Aftermath===

At 03:00 on 13 November, Admiral Yamamoto postponed the planned landings of the transports, which returned to the Shortlands to await further orders. Dawn revealed three crippled Japanese (&quot;Hiei&quot;, &quot;Yūdachi&quot;, and &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;) and three crippled U.S. ships (&quot;Portland&quot;, &quot;Atlanta&quot;, and &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;) in the general vicinity of Savo Island. &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; was attacked by U.S. dive bombers but escaped further damage as she headed to Truk, and she eventually returned to action several months later. The abandoned hulk of &quot;Yūdachi&quot; was sunk by &quot;Portland&quot;, whose guns were still functioning despite other damage to the ship. The tugboat motored around Ironbottom Sound throughout the day of 13 November, assisting the damaged U.S. ships and rescuing U.S. survivors from the water.

During the morning and early afternoon, IJN carrier under the command of Vice Admiral Kakuji Kakuta, which was located about 200 miles north of the Solomons, dispatched several combat air patrols, consisting of Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters and Nakajima B5N and Aichi D3A bombers (for navigational aid), to cover the crippled &quot;Hiei&quot;. In addition, several more patrols were dispatched from ground bases at Rabaul and Buin. These patrols engaged U.S. aircraft that were sent from Henderson Field and from the aircraft carrier , but they could not save &quot;Hiei&quot;.

&quot;Hiei&quot; was attacked repeatedly by Marine Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo planes from Henderson Field, Navy TBF Avengers, and Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which had departed Nouméa on 11 November, as well as Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers of the U.S. Army Air Forces&#x27; 11th Bombardment Group from Espiritu Santo. Abe and his staff transferred to &quot;Yukikaze&quot; at 08:15. &quot;Kirishima&quot; was ordered by Abe to take &quot;Hiei&quot; under tow, escorted by &quot;Nagara&quot; and her destroyers, but the attempt was cancelled because of the threat of submarine attack and &quot;Hiei&quot;″s increasing unseaworthiness. After sustaining more damage from air attacks, &quot;Hiei&quot; sank northwest of Savo Island, perhaps after being scuttled by her remaining crew, in the late evening of 13 November.

==== Sinking of the Juneau ====

&quot;Portland&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Aaron Ward&quot;, and &quot;Sterett&quot; were eventually able to make their way to rear-area ports for repairs. &quot;Atlanta&quot;, however, sank near Guadalcanal at 20:00 on 13 November. Departing from the Solomon Islands area with &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot;, &quot;Sterett&quot;, and &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; later that day, &quot;Juneau&quot; and the other warships were detected by the , which fired three torpedoes. They missed their intended target, the crippled &quot;San Francisco&quot;, but one veered off and hit the crippled &quot;Juneau&quot; in the exact same location &quot;Amatsukaze&#x27;s&quot; torpedo hit during the surface battle. This damage inflicted the coup de grâce as a massive explosion sent &quot;Juneau&quot; crashing to the ocean floor in under a minute. &quot;Juneau&quot;″s 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 697) were left to fend for themselves in the open ocean for eight days before rescue aircraft belatedly arrived. While awaiting rescue, all but ten of &quot;Juneau&quot;″s crew had died from their injuries, the elements, or shark attacks. The dead included the five Sullivan brothers.

Most historians appear to agree that Abe&#x27;s decision to retreat represented a strategic victory for the United States. Henderson Field remained operational with attack aircraft ready to deter the slow Imperial transports from approaching Guadalcanal with their precious cargoes. Plus, the Japanese had lost an opportunity to eliminate the U.S. naval forces in the area, a result which would have taken even the comparatively resource-rich U.S. some time to recover from. Reportedly furious, Admiral Yamamoto relieved Abe of command and later directed his forced retirement from the IJN. It appears that Yamamoto may have been more angry over the loss of one of his battleships (&quot;Hiei&quot;) than he was over the abandonment of the supply mission and failure to completely destroy the U.S. force. Shortly before noon, Yamamoto ordered Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondō, commanding the Second Fleet at Truk, to form a new bombardment unit around &quot;Kirishima&quot; and attack Henderson Field on the night of 14–15 November.

Including the sinking of &quot;Juneau&quot;, total U.S. losses in the battle were 1,439 dead. The Japanese suffered between 550 and 800 dead. The U.S. ships that were sunk or scuttled during the battle were two light cruisers, and , and four destroyers, , , , and . Analyzing the effect of this engagement, historian Richard B. Frank states:

This action stands without peer for furious, close-range, and confused fighting during the war. But the result was not decisive. The self-sacrifice of Callaghan and his task force had purchased one night&#x27;s respite for Henderson Field. It had postponed, not stopped, the landing of major Japanese reinforcements, nor had the greater portion of the (Japanese) Combined Fleet yet been heard from.&quot;

==Transports approach, 13–14 November==
Although the reinforcement effort to Guadalcanal was delayed, the Japanese did not give up trying to complete the original mission, albeit a day later than originally planned. On the afternoon of 13 November, Tanaka and the 11 transports resumed their journey toward Guadalcanal. A Japanese force of cruisers and destroyers from the 8th Fleet (based primarily at Rabaul and originally assigned to cover the unloading of the transports on the evening of 13 November) was given the mission that Abe&#x27;s force had failed to carry out—the bombardment of Henderson Field. The battleship &quot;Kirishima&quot;, after abandoning her rescue effort of &quot;Hiei&quot; on the morning of 13 November, steamed north between Santa Isabel and Malaita Islands with her accompanying warships to rendezvous with Kondo&#x27;s Second Fleet, inbound from Truk, to form the new bombardment unit.

The 8th Fleet cruiser force, under the command of Mikawa, included the heavy cruisers and , the and the older and smaller , the light cruisers and , and six destroyers: , , , , , . Mikawa&#x27;s force was able to slip into the Guadalcanal area uncontested, the battered U.S. naval force having withdrawn. &quot;Suzuya&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot;, under the command of Shōji Nishimura, bombarded Henderson Field while the rest of Mikawa&#x27;s force cruised around Savo Island, guarding against any U.S. surface attack (which in the event did not occur). The 35-minute bombardment caused some damage to various aircraft and facilities on the airfield but did not put it out of operation. The cruiser force ended the bombardment around 02:30 on 14 November and cleared the area to head towards Rabaul on a course south of the New Georgia island group.

At daybreak, aircraft from Henderson Field, Espiritu Santo, and &quot;Enterprise&quot;—stationed south of Guadalcanal—began their attacks, first on Mikawa&#x27;s force heading away from Guadalcanal, and then on the transport force heading towards the island. The attacks on Mikawa&#x27;s force sank &quot;Kinugasa&quot;, killing 511 of her crew, and damaged &quot;Maya&quot;, forcing her to return to Japan for repairs. &quot;Chokai&quot; suffered damage from near misses, causing some flooding and reduced speed. &quot;Michishio&quot; was critically damaged by near misses, losing all propulsion. She had to be towed out of the battle and then all the way back to Japan, arriving in March 1943 with repairs finished in November 1943. Two of &quot;Isuzu&quot;″s boiler rooms were flooded as a result of near misses, reducing her speed.

Repeated air attacks on the transport force overwhelmed the escorting Japanese fighter aircraft, sank six of the transports, and forced one more to turn back with heavy damage, before she later sank. Survivors from the transports were rescued by the convoy&#x27;s escorting destroyers and returned to the Shortlands. A total of 450 army troops were reported to have perished. The remaining four transports and four destroyers continued towards Guadalcanal after nightfall of 14 November but stopped west of Guadalcanal to await the outcome of a warship surface action developing nearby (see below) before continuing.

Kondo&#x27;s ad hoc force rendezvoused at Ontong Java on the evening of 13 November, then reversed course and refueled out of range of Henderson Field&#x27;s bombers on the morning of 14 November. The U.S. submarine stalked but was unable to attack &quot;Kirishima&quot; during refueling. The bombardment force continued south and came under air attack late in the afternoon of 14 November, during which they were also attacked by the submarine , which launched five torpedoes (but scored no hits) before reporting her contact by radio.

&quot;Kinugasa&quot; was the third and last Japanese heavy cruiser to be sunk in the Solomon Islands campaign. Almost two years passed before the Japanese navy lost another, when six were sunk in the Battle of Leyte Gulf within the span of a few days.

==Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 14–15 November==

===Prelude===
Kondo&#x27;s force approached Guadalcanal via Indispensable Strait around midnight on 14 November, and a quarter moon provided moderate visibility of about . The force included &quot;Kirishima&quot;, heavy cruisers and , light cruisers and &quot;Sendai&quot;, and nine destroyers, some of the destroyers being survivors (along with &quot;Kirishima&quot; and &quot;Nagara&quot;) of the first night engagement two days prior. Kondo flew his flag in the cruiser &quot;Atago&quot;.

Low on undamaged ships, Admiral William Halsey, Jr., detached the new battleships and , of &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s support group, together with four destroyers, as TF 64 under Admiral Willis A. &quot;Ching&quot; Lee to defend Guadalcanal and Henderson Field. It was a scratch force; the battleships had operated together for only a few days, and their four escorts were from four different divisions—chosen simply because, of the available destroyers, they had the most fuel. The U.S. force arrived in Ironbottom Sound in the evening of 14 November and began patrolling around Savo Island. The U.S. warships were in column formation with the four destroyers in the lead, followed by &quot;Washington&quot;, with &quot;South Dakota&quot; bringing up the rear.

At 22:55 on 14 November, radar on &quot;South Dakota&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot; began picking up Kondo&#x27;s approaching ships near Savo Island, at a distance of around .

===Action===
Kondo split his force into several groups with one group—commanded by Shintaro Hashimoto and consisting of &quot;Sendai&quot; and destroyers and (&quot;C&quot; on the maps)—sweeping along the east side of Savo Island, and destroyer (&quot;B&quot; on the maps) sweeping counterclockwise around the southwest side of Savo Island to check for the presence of Allied ships. The Japanese ships spotted Lee&#x27;s force around 23:00, though Kondo misidentified the battleships as cruisers. Kondo ordered the &quot;Sendai&quot; group of ships—plus &quot;Nagara&quot; and four destroyers (&quot;D&quot; on the maps)—to engage and destroy the U.S. force before he brought the bombardment force of &quot;Kirishima&quot; and heavy cruisers (&quot;E&quot; on the maps) into Ironbottom Sound. The U.S. ships (&quot;A&quot; on the maps) detected the &quot;Sendai&quot; force on radar but did not detect the other groups of Japanese ships. Using radar targeting, the two U.S. battleships opened fire on the &quot;Sendai&quot; group at 23:17. Admiral Lee ordered a cease fire about five minutes later after the northern group disappeared from his ship&#x27;s radar. &quot;Sendai&quot;, &quot;Uranami&quot;, and &quot;Shikinami&quot; were undamaged and circled out of the danger area.
====U.S. escort wiped out====

Meanwhile, the four U.S. destroyers in the vanguard of the U.S. formation began engaging both &quot;Ayanami&quot; and the &quot;Nagara&quot; group of ships at 23:22. &quot;Nagara&quot; and her escorting destroyers responded effectively with accurate gunfire and torpedoes. &quot;Nagara&quot; scored the first kill of this stage of the battle when she focused her gunfire on the destroyer &quot;Preston&quot;, hitting her some nine times which ignited her magazines. &quot;Ayanami&quot; meanwhile targeted the destroyer &quot;Walke&quot;, hitting her with several shells and a torpedo that blew off her bow. Both of these destroyers sank within 10 minutes. Another stray torpedo from &quot;Ayanami&quot; hit the destroyer &quot;Benham&quot; and blew off her bow (leading to her being scuttled the next day). Gunfire from the Japanese ships finally hit in her engine room and put her out of the fight. The U.S. destroyers had completed their mission as screens for the battleships, absorbing the initial impact of contact with the enemy although at great cost. Lee ordered the retirement of &quot;Benham&quot; and &quot;Gwin&quot; at 23:48.

====&quot;South Dakota&quot; in peril====

&quot;Washington&quot; passed through the area still occupied by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on &quot;Ayanami&quot; with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, &quot;South Dakota&quot; suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable. Nonetheless, she continued to follow &quot;Washington&quot; towards the western side of Savo Island until 23:35, when &quot;Washington&quot; changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. &quot;South Dakota&quot; tried to follow but had to turn to starboard to avoid &quot;Benham&quot; which resulted in the ship being silhouetted by the fires of the burning destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.

Receiving reports of the destruction of the U.S. destroyers from &quot;Ayanami&quot; and his other ships, Kondo pointed his bombardment force towards Guadalcanal, believing that the U.S. warship force had been defeated. His force and the two U.S. battleships were now heading towards each other.

Almost blind and unable to effectively fire her main and secondary armament, &quot;South Dakota&quot; was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes by most of the ships of the Japanese force including &quot;Kirishima&quot;, beginning around midnight on 15 November. Although able to score a few hits on &quot;Kirishima&quot;, &quot;South Dakota&quot; took 26 hits—some of which did not explode—that completely knocked out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement. All of the Japanese torpedoes missed. Admiral Lee later described the cumulative effect of the gunfire damage to &quot;South Dakota&quot; as to, &quot;render one of our new battleships deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent.&quot; &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s crew casualties were 39 killed and 59 wounded, and she turned away from the battle at 00:17 without informing Admiral Lee, though observed by Kondo&#x27;s lookouts.

====&quot;Washington&quot; to the rescue====

The Japanese ships continued to concentrate their fire on &quot;South Dakota&quot; and none detected &quot;Washington&quot; approaching to within . &quot;Washington&quot; was tracking a large target (&quot;Kirishima&quot;) for some time but refrained from firing since there was a chance it could be &quot;South Dakota&quot;. &quot;Washington&quot; had not been able to track &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s movements because she was in a blind spot in &quot;Washington&quot;″s radar and Lee could not raise her on the radio to confirm her position. When the Japanese illuminated and fired on &quot;South Dakota&quot;, all doubts were removed as to which ships were friend or foe. From this close range, &quot;Washington&quot; opened fire and quickly hit &quot;Kirishima&quot; with at least nine (and possibly up to 20) main battery shells and at least 17 secondary ones, disabling all of &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s main gun turrets, causing major flooding, and setting her aflame. &quot;Kirishima&quot; was hit below the waterline and suffered a jammed rudder, causing her to circle uncontrollably to port. &quot;Washington&quot; also fired on &quot;Atago&quot; with her secondary battery, lightly damaging the cruiser with a single 5-inch (127 mm) shell hit.

At 00:25, Kondo ordered all of his ships that were able to, to converge and destroy any remaining U.S. ships. Having just joined the battle upon hearing of the engagement, the destroyers &quot;Kagerō&quot; and &quot;Oyashio&quot; fired their torpedoes at &quot;Washington&quot;, but none of them hit the battleship, while the other surviving U.S. ships had already departed the battle area. &quot;Washington&quot; steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged &quot;South Dakota&quot;. The Japanese ships finally sighted &quot;Washington&quot; and launched several torpedo attacks, but she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.

===Aftermath===
&quot;Ayanami&quot; was scuttled by &quot;Uranami&quot; at 02:00, while &quot;Kirishima&quot; capsized and sank by 03:25 on 15 November. &quot;Uranami&quot; rescued survivors from &quot;Ayanami&quot; and destroyers &quot;Asagumo&quot;, &quot;Teruzuki&quot;, and &quot;Samidare&quot; rescued the remaining crew from &quot;Kirishima&quot;. Three U.S. destroyers, , , and , were sunk during the battle. In the engagement, 242 U.S. and 249 Japanese sailors died. The engagement was one of only two battleship-against-battleship surface battles in the entire Pacific campaign of World War II, the other being at the Surigao Strait during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.
The four Japanese transports beached themselves at Tassafaronga on Guadalcanal by 04:00 on 15 November, and Tanaka and the escort destroyers departed and raced back up the Slot toward safer waters. The transports were attacked, beginning at 05:55, by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field and elsewhere, and by field artillery from U.S. ground forces on Guadalcanal. Later, the destroyer approached and opened fire on the beached transports and surrounding area. These attacks set the transports afire and destroyed any equipment on them that the Japanese had not yet managed to unload. Only 2,000 to 3,000 of the embarked troops made it to Guadalcanal, and most of their ammunition and food was lost.

Yamamoto&#x27;s reaction to Kondo&#x27;s failure to accomplish his mission of neutralizing Henderson Field and ensuring the safe landing of troops and supplies was milder than his earlier reaction to Abe&#x27;s withdrawal, perhaps because of Imperial Navy culture and politics. Kondo, who also held the position of second in command of the Combined Fleet, was a member of the upper staff and battleship &quot;clique&quot; of the Imperial Navy, while Abe was a career destroyer specialist. Admiral Kondo was not reprimanded or reassigned, but, instead, was left in command of one of the large ship fleets based at Truk.

==Significance==
The failure to deliver to Guadalcanal most of the troops and especially supplies in the convoy prevented the Japanese from launching another offensive to retake Henderson Field. Thereafter, the Imperial Navy was able to deliver only subsistence supplies and a few replacement troops to Japanese Army forces on Guadalcanal. Because of the continuing threat from Allied aircraft based at Henderson Field, plus nearby U.S. aircraft carriers, the Japanese had to continue to rely on Tokyo Express warship deliveries to their forces on Guadalcanal. These supplies and replacements were not enough to sustain Japanese troops on the island, who – by 7 December 1942 – were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground and air attacks. On 12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could be retaken from the Allies, Japan&#x27;s Imperial General Headquarters—with approval from the Emperor—agreed on 31 December to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on New Georgia.


Thus, the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal was the last major attempt by the Japanese to seize control of the seas around Guadalcanal or to retake the island. In contrast, the U.S. Navy was thereafter able to resupply the U.S. forces at Guadalcanal at will, including the delivery of two fresh divisions by late December 1942. The inability to neutralize Henderson Field doomed the Japanese effort to successfully combat the Allied conquest of Guadalcanal. The last Japanese resistance in the Guadalcanal campaign ended on 9 February 1943, with the successful evacuation of most of the surviving Japanese troops from the island by the Japanese Navy in Operation Ke. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, which culminated in Japan&#x27;s defeat and the end of World War II. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, upon learning of the results of the battle, commented, &quot;It would seem that the turning point in this war has at last been reached.&quot;

Historian Eric Hammel sums up the significance of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal this way:
On November 12, 1942, the (Japanese) Imperial Navy had the better ships and the better tactics. After November 15, 1942, its leaders lost heart and it lacked the strategic depth to face the burgeoning U.S. Navy and its vastly improving weapons and tactics. The Japanese never got better while, after November 1942, the U.S. Navy never stopped getting better.

General Alexander Vandegrift, the commander of the troops on Guadalcanal, paid tribute to the sailors who fought the battle:
We believe the enemy has undoubtedly suffered a crushing defeat. We thank Admiral Kinkaid for his intervention yesterday. We thank Lee for his sturdy effort last night. Our own aircraft has been grand in its relentless hammering of the foe. All those efforts are appreciated but our greatest homage goes to Callaghan, Scott and their men who with magnificent courage against seemingly hopeless odds drove back the first hostile attack and paved the way for the success to follow. To them the men of Cactus lift their battered helmets in deepest admiration.

<doc id="405412" wikidata="Q1132703" url="?curid=405412" title="Power politics">
<text>Power politics is a theory of power in international relations which contends that distributions of power and national interests, or changes to those distributions, are fundamental causes of war and of system stability.

The concept of power politics provides a way of understanding systems of international relations: in this view, states compete for the world&#x27;s limited resources, and it is to an individual state&#x27;s advantage to be manifestly able to harm others. Power politics prioritizes national self-interest over the interests of other nations or the international community, and thus may include threatening one another with military, economic, or political aggression to protect one nation&#x27;s own interest.

== Techniques ==

Techniques of power politics include:

* Deterrence theory, in which a weaker state deters attack by bolstering its defensive capabilities enough to render attacking infeasible
* Conspicuous weapons development (including nuclear development)
* Pre-emptive strikes
* Blackmail
* Assassination of foreign political or military leaders
* The massing of military units on a border, whether for stationing or for exercises
* The imposition of tariffs or economic sanctions (possibly to initiate a trade war)
* Proxy warfare
* Bait and bleed and &quot;bloodletting&quot; tactics
* Hard and soft balancing
* Buck-passing, in which a state attempts to coerce another state to confront a threat, in order to preserve its own capabilities and possibly intervene later
* The use of espionage to subvert another state&#x27;s capabilities from within
* Covert and clandestine military operations, in which states obscure their role in an operation or conduct the operation in secret, respectively
* Shock and awe, in which a state uses a real (or played-up) show of force to deter potential attack
* Asymmetric warfare, in which a state uses unconventional warfare methods in order to exploit another&#x27;s weaknesses
* Propaganda, in which a state or its agencies use adverse inaccurate information to weaken another&#x27;s reputation.

=== Machtpolitik ===
The German version is &quot;Machtpolitik&quot;. It celebrates the idea of conflict between nations as a means of asserting the national will and strengthening the state. This idea is somewhat related to &quot;Realpolitik&quot;, but it specifically acknowledges that the German Empire was established through the use of force by the Prussian military and Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s diplomacy. It also reflects a romanticized view of military virtues and the belief that international conflicts have a moral purpose. For instance, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, who was instrumental in Prussia&#x27;s victories over Denmark, Austria, and France, once expressed a Machtpolitik sentiment by saying that &quot;war is a part of the divine order of the world.&quot; This concept is also linked to militarism and social Darwinism.

== Cyclical theories of power politics ==

=== George Modelski ===

George Modelski defines global order as a &#x27;management network centred on a lead unit and contenders for leadership, (pursuing) collective action at the global level&#x27;. The system is allegedly cyclical. Each cycle is about 100 years&#x27; duration and a new hegemonic power appears each time:

# Portugal 1492–1580; in the Age of Discovery
# The Netherlands 1580–1688; beginning with the Eighty Years&#x27; War, 1579–1588
# The United Kingdom (1) 1688–1792; beginning with the wars of Louis XIV
# United Kingdom (2) 1792–1914; beginning with the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars
# The United States 1914 to (predicted) 2030; beginning with World War I and two.

Each cycle has four phases;

# Global war, which a) involves almost all global powers, b) is &#x27;characteristically naval&#x27; c) is caused by a system breakdown, d) is extremely lethal, e) results in a new global leader, capable of tackling global problems. The war is a &#x27;decision process&#x27; analogous to a national election. The Thirty Years War, though lasting and destructive, was not a &#x27;global war&#x27;.
# World power, which lasts for &#x27;about one generation&#x27;. The new incumbent power &#x27;prioritises global problems&#x27;, mobilises a coalition, is decisive and innovative. Pre-modern communities become dependent on the hegemonic power.
# Delegitimation. This phase can last for 20–27 years; the hegemonic power falters, as rival powers assert new nationalistic policies.
# Deconcentration. The hegemony&#x27;s problem-solving capacity declines. It yields to a multipolar order of warring rivals. Pre-modern communities become less dependent. A challenger appears (successively, Spain, France, France, Germany, and the USSR) and a new global war ensues.

The hegemonic nations tend to have: &#x27;insular geography&#x27;; a stable, open society; a strong economy; strategic organisation, and strong political parties. By contrast, the &#x27;challenger&#x27; nations have: closed systems; absolute rulers; domestic instability; and continental geographic locations.

The long cycle system is repetitive, but also evolutionary. According to Modelski, it originated in about 1493 through a) the decline of Venetian naval power, b) Chinese abandonment of naval exploration, and c) discovery of sea routes to India and the Americas. It has developed in parallel with the growth of the nation-state, political parties, command of the sea, and &#x27;dependency of pre-modern communities&#x27;. The system is flawed, lacking in coherence, solidarity, and capacity to address the North-South divide. Modelski speculates that US deconcentration might be replaced by a power based in the &#x27;Pacific rim&#x27; or by an explicit coalition of nations, as &#x27;co-operation is urgently required in respect of nuclear weapons&#x27;.

Modelski &#x27;dismisses the idea that international relations are anarchic&#x27;. His research, influenced by Immanuel Wallerstein, was &#x27;measured in decades... a major achievement&#x27; says Peter J. Taylor.

=== Joshua S. Goldstein ===

Goldstein in 1988 posited a &#x27;hegemony cycle&#x27; of 150 years&#x27; duration, the four hegemonic powers since 1494 being;

# Hapsburg Spain, 1494–1648; ended by the Thirty Years War, in which Spain itself was the &#x27;challenger&#x27;; the Treaty of Westphalia and the beginnings of the nation-state.
# The Netherlands, 1648–1815; ended by the challenge from France of the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, the Treaty of Vienna and introduction of the Congress System
# Great Britain, 1815–1945; ended by Germany&#x27;s challenge in two World Wars, and the postwar settlement, including the World Bank, IMF, GATT, the United Nations and NATO
# The United States, since 1945.

Goldstein suggests that US hegemony may &#x27;at an indeterminate time&#x27; be challenged and ended by China (the &#x27;best fit&#x27;), by western Europe, Japan, or (writing in 1988) the USSR. The situation is unstable due to the continuance of Machiavellian power politics and the deployment of nuclear weapons. The choice lies between &#x27;global cooperation or global suicide&#x27;. Thus there may be &#x27;an end to hegemony itself&#x27;.

Goldstein speculates that Venetian hegemony, ceded to Spain in 1494, may have begun in 1350.

<doc id="405414" wikidata="Q2916852" url="?curid=405414" title="Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership">
<text>Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of gun rights in the United States and to encourage Americans to understand, uphold, and defend &quot;all of the Bill of Rights for all Citizens.&quot; The group was founded by U.S. Navy veteran, former FFL dealer, and author Aaron S. Zelman in 1989. Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership recognizes the Second Amendment as protecting a pre-existing natural law right of individuals to keep and bear arms. It is based in Bellevue, Washington.

Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership takes the position that an armed citizenry is the population&#x27;s last line of defense against tyranny by their own government. The organization is noted for producing materials (bumper stickers, posters, billboards, booklets, videos, etc.) with messages that equate gun control with totalitarianism, often through the Nazi gun control argument. The most famous of these are the &quot;All in favor of Gun Control raise your right hand&quot; materials, which features a drawing of Adolf Hitler giving a Nazi salute. The organization also attempts to prove that genocide is linked to gun control, by showing that most countries where a genocide has taken place had gun control first.

Members are not required to be Jewish. The only membership requirement is that you must be a &quot;law-abiding citizen,&quot; by &quot;obeying the Bill of Rights.&quot;

== History ==
In 2010, JPFO Founder Aaron Zelman issued an open letter to NRA Board of Directors member Ted Nugent, titled &quot;The Day I&#x27;ll join the NRA.&quot;

Zelman died on December 21, 2010, age 64.

The JPFO David &amp; Goliath Award, created in 2011, is given to individuals or groups who advocate for firearms ownership. Recipients include: David Codrea and Mike Vanderboegh, the investigative reporters who broke the Fast and Furious scandal (2011); Emily Miller, the Washington Times columnist who documented Washington, D.C.’s reluctance to obey its own gun laws (2013); Stephen P. Halbrook, Ph.D., the author and attorney who linked Nazi gun confiscations directly to the Holocaust (2014): and Kyle Kashuv, Stoneman Douglas High School mass murder survivor and Second Amendment rights activist (2018).

Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership has been highly critical of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). In pamphlets such as &quot;Why Does the ADL Support Nazi-Based Laws?&quot; and &quot;JPFO Facts vs. ADL Lies,&quot; the JPFO has accused the ADL of undermining the welfare of the Jewish people. In response, Abraham Foxman, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, wrote about the JPFO, &quot;Anti-Semitism has a long and painful history, and the linkage to gun control is a tactic by Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership to manipulate the fear of anti-Semitism toward their own end... It is a campaign that has been viewed with concern by many in the Jewish community.&quot;

In 2016, JPFO launched the &quot;Don&#x27;t Inspire Evil Initiative&quot;, a proposal that urges journalists &quot;to refrain from gratuitous or repetitious portrayal of mass murderers&#x27; names and images.&quot;

Modeled after the Doomsday Clock, JPFO&#x27;s &quot;Gun Confiscation Clock&quot; tracks what JPFO sees as the threat to Americans&#x27; right to keep and bear arms.

In 2018, JPFO advisory board member Dov Marhoffer, a Holocaust concentration camp survivor, penned an op-ed titled &quot;Never Again&quot; calling attention to what JPFO believes to be an appropriate historical understanding and context of the motto. In the piece, Marhoffer sees alternative usage of the motto promoting gun control as inappropriate.

==Political positions==

Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership claims that parts of the text of the Gun Control Act of 1968 were translated from Nazi legislation. The German Weapons Law, which existed before the Nazis came to power in 1933, was altered on 18 March 1938 by the Nazi Government. The JPFO&#x27;s claim is based in part on the fact that the 1968 GCA introduces the &quot;sporting purpose&quot; test to distinguish different types of weapons, similar to the &quot;sporting purpose&quot; test that existed in the German law in question. Senator Thomas Dodd was a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials and had reviewed copies of the Nazi Germany firearms laws, and in 1968 requested translations of these from the Library of Congress.

Bernard Harcourt, professor at the University of Chicago Law School, in discussing this fundamental proposition advanced by the JPFO, notes, &quot;[O]n January 13th, 1919, the Reichstag enacted legislation requiring surrender of all guns to the government. This law, as well as the August 7, 1920, &quot;Law on the Disarmament of the People&quot; passed in light of the Versailles Treaty, remained in effect until 1928, when the German parliament enacted the &quot;Law on Firearms and Ammunition&quot; (April 12, 1928)—a law which relaxed gun restrictions and put into effect a strict firearm licensing scheme.&quot; Harcourt continued, &quot;To be sure, the Nazis were intent on killing Jewish persons and used the gun laws and regulations to further the genocide&quot;, but he concluded that the firearms laws were not central to implementing the Holocaust.

Attorney and author Stephen Halbrook, in his law article &quot;Nazi Firearms Law and the Disarming of the German Jews&quot;, asserts that German arms laws were extremely lax, and even under the 1920 &quot;Law on the Disarmament of the People&quot;, only items such as grenades and machineguns were banned and small arms such as rifles and pistols remained in common use. Valery Polozov, a former advisor to the committee on national security in the Russian Duma, claims in his book &quot;Firearms in Civil Society&quot; that Germany did not in fact have comprehensive gun control legislation up until 1928, which created the legal framework later built upon by the Nazis. Halbrook did clarify in the first sentences of his article that, &quot;Gun control laws are depicted as benign and historically progressive. However, German firearm laws and hysteria created against Jewish firearm owners played a major role in laying the groundwork for the eradication of German Jewry in the Holocaust.&quot;

== Activities ==
JPFO publishes for its membership the &quot;Bill of Rights Sentinel,&quot; a quarterly newsletter, with a masthead featuring the motto, &quot;All the Bill of Rights for All Citizens.&quot;

JPFO&#x27;s Rabbinic Directors, providing guidance on Judaism and firearms, include Rabbi R. Mermelstein and Rabbi Dovid Bendory.

JPFO founder Aaron Zelman encouraged Americans to celebrate Bill of Rights Day (December 15).

<text>The 1970 Polish protests, also known as the December 1970 Events (), occurred in northern Poland from 14–19 December 1970. The protests were sparked by a sudden increase in the prices of food and other everyday items while wages remained stagnant. Strikes were put down by the Polish People&#x27;s Army and the Citizen&#x27;s Militia, resulting in at least 44 people killed and more than 1,000 wounded.

==Background==
In December 1970, the government suddenly announced major increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, especially dairy products, after bad harvests throughout the year. The increases proved to be a major shock to ordinary citizens, especially in the larger cities.

==Events==
Demonstrations against the price increases broke out in the northern Baltic coastal cities of Gdańsk, Gdynia, Elbląg, and Szczecin. The regime was concerned about an emerging wave of sabotage, which may have been inspired by the secret police, who wanted to legitimize a harsh response to the protestors. Another possible reason why the secret police would instigate sabotage and violence would be to precipitate a change in the leadership of the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR), by causing violent deaths among the workers and then blaming the party for them. 

Protests started on 14 December. When a party official tried to convince the strikers to return to work, addressing them using loudspeakers on a police car, the strikers took over the police car and used the loudspeakers to announce a general strike, and to call for a demonstration in front of the party building to be held the same day. Fighting against the police started in the afternoon, and widespread fighting and rioting, including arson, continued until late in the evening.

The police started rounding up workers, often random ones who did not participate in protests or rioting, and brutally beating them, commonly using a technique in which the detainee was forced to move along a long row of policemen, all of them beating the detainee with their batons.

On 15 December in Gdańsk, strikers set fire (reportedly twice) to the building of the Provincial Committee of the ruling party, which became an iconic moment of the protests. They also took some policemen prisoner, transported them to the Gdańsk Shipyard, forced them to change into the workers&#x27; work clothing, and then transported them to a police station. Fire consumed the roof of the Provincial Committee&#x27;s building until the protesters were repelled by a column of twenty OT-62 military armored personnel carriers. At least six people are known to be killed on 15 December in Gdańsk. Two more were shot to death the next morning, at or near the shipyard.

Vice prime minister Stanisław Kociołek, in his televised speech on the evening of 16 December, condemned the protesters but also called for the workers to get back to work. However, on the night, the shipyard in Gdynia was surrounded by the police and the army, including tanks. Responding to the vice PM&#x27;s appeal proved deadly to some of the workers. In Gdynia, the soldiers had orders to stop workers returning to work and on 17 December fired into the crowd of workers emerging from their trains; at least 11 of them were killed. Then, in other parts of Gdynia, people were shot dead while protesting, bringing the official death toll in Gdynia to 18. The number of the wounded in Gdynia is far from certain but is estimated to be in the hundreds.

The protest movement then spread to other cities, leading to strikes and occupations. The government mobilized 5,000 members of special squads of police and 27,000 soldiers equipped with heavy tanks and machine guns. Overall, more than 1,000 people were wounded and at least 44 killed.

==Resolution==

The Party leadership met in Warsaw and decided that a full-scale working-class revolt was inevitable unless drastic steps were taken. With the consent of Leonid Brezhnev in Moscow, Gomułka, Kliszko, and other leaders were forced to resign: if the price rises had been a plot against Gomułka, it succeeded. Since Moscow would not accept Mieczysław Moczar, Edward Gierek was drafted as the new leader. The price increases were reversed, wage increases announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised. Gierek went to Gdańsk and met the workers, apologised for the mistakes of the past, promised a political renewal and said that, as a worker himself, he would now govern for the people.

Stanisław Kociołek lost the position of vice prime minister. For a short time he remained a member of the Central Committee, but in February 1971 he was reassigned to diplomatic service. That was soon after in January 1971, in a reversal of the previous policy of secrecy, government-controlled media published the list of 44 people who were killed during the protests.

== Impact ==
Although the aims of the protesters were mostly social and economic rather than political, the riots reinvigorated the dormant political activity of Polish society. Nevertheless, the workers from the coast did not prevent the government from implementing its goal of increased food prices; that was only achieved a few weeks later, after the 1971 Łódź strikes.

Polish protests elicited broad sympathy and support, both in Western Europe and the Soviet bloc. There were copycat strikes on the Kühlungsborn Pier in East Germany and in Riga; Soviet sailors on stranded Soviet ships shared their food with the citizens of Gdańsk and Szczecin, while Polish strikers shielded Soviet families in Poland from reprisals.

Subsequent protests broke out in 1976 and 1980. The latter led to the founding of the Solidarity union.

<doc id="405419" wikidata="Q48005" url="?curid=405419" title="History of antisemitism">
<text>The history of antisemitism, defined as hostile actions or discrimination against Jews as a religious or ethnic group, goes back many centuries, being called &quot;the longest hatred&quot;. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:

# Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in Ancient Greece and Rome that was primarily ethnic in nature
# Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages that was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
# Muslim antisemitism that was—at least in its classical form—nuanced, in that Jews were a protected class
# Political, social, and economic antisemitism during the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe that laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
# Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism
# Contemporary antisemitism, which has been labeled by some as the new antisemitism

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: &quot;ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; Christian antisemitism, which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the 19th and 20th centuries&quot;. In practice, it is difficult to differentiate antisemitism from the general ill-treatment of nations by other nations before the Roman period, but since the adoption of Christianity in Europe, antisemitism has undoubtedly been present. The Islamic world has also historically seen the Jews as outsiders. The coming of the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions in 19th-century Europe bred a new manifestation of antisemitism, based as much upon race as upon religion, which culminated in the Holocaust that occurred during World War II. The formation of the state of Israel in 1948 caused new antisemitic tensions in the Middle East.

==Classical period==

===Early animosity towards Jews===

Louis H. Feldman argues: &quot;We must take issue with the &quot;communis sensus&quot; that the pagan writers are predominantly anti-Semitic.&quot; He asserts that &quot;one of the great puzzles that has confronted the students of anti-semitism is the alleged shift from pro-Jewish statements found in the first pagan writers who mention the Jews ... to the vicious anti-Jewish statements thereafter, beginning with Manetho about 270 BCE&quot;. In view of Manetho&#x27;s anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by &quot;the Greek retelling of Ancient Egyptian prejudices&quot;. As examples of pagan writers who spoke positively of Jews, Feldman cites Aristotle, Theophrastus, Clearchus of Soli and Megasthenes. Feldman concedes that, after Manetho: &quot;The picture usually painted is one of universal and virulent anti-Judaism.&quot;

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced back to Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE. Alexandrian Jewry were the largest Jewish community in the world and the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, was produced there. Manetho, an Egyptian priest and historian of that time, wrote scathingly of the Jews and his themes are repeated in the works of Chaeremon, Lysimachus, Poseidonius, Apollonius Molon, and in Apion and Tacitus. Hecateus of Abdera is quoted by Flavius Josephus as having written about the time of Alexander the Great that the Jews &quot;have often been treated injuriously by the kings and governors of Persia, yet can they not be dissuaded from acting what they think best; but that when they are stripped on this account, and have torments inflicted upon them, and they are brought to the most terrible kinds of death, they meet them after an extraordinary manner, beyond all other people, and will not renounce the religion of their forefathers&quot;. One of the earliest anti-Jewish edicts, promulgated by Antiochus Epiphanes in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the Maccabees in Judea.

The ancient Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died. The violence in Alexandria may have been caused by the Jews&#x27; being portrayed as misanthropic. Tcherikover argues that the reason for the hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the &quot;poleis&quot;. However, Bohak has argued that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, because many Greeks showed animosity towards any group which they considered barbaric.

Statements which exhibit prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many pagan Greek and Roman writers. Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews&#x27; refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataeus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses &quot;in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life&quot;. Manetho wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian lepers who had been taught &quot;not to adore the gods&quot; by Moses. The same themes appear in the works of Chaeremon, Lysimachus, Poseidonius, Apollonius Molon, and in Apion and Tacitus. Agatharchides of Cnidus wrote about the &quot;ridiculous practices&quot; of the Jews and he also wrote about the &quot;absurdity of their Law&quot;, and he also wrote about how Ptolemy Lagus was able to invade Jerusalem in 320 BC because its inhabitants were observing the Sabbath. Edward Flannery describes the form of antisemitism which existed in ancient times as being essentially &quot;cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia which was played out in political settings&quot;.

In one recorded instance, an Ancient Greek ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, desecrated the Temple in Jerusalem and banned Jewish religious practices, such as circumcision, &quot;Shabbat&quot; observance, and the study of Jewish religious books, during the period when Ancient Greece dominated the eastern Mediterranean. Statements exhibiting prejudice towards Jews and their religion can also be found in the works of a few pagan Greek and Roman writers, but the earliest occurrence of antisemitism has been the subject of debate among scholars, largely because different writers use different definitions of antisemitism. The terms &quot;religious antisemitism&quot; and &quot;anti-Judaism&quot; are sometimes used in reference to animosity towards Judaism as a religion rather than antisemitism, which is used in reference to animosity towards Jews as members of an ethnic or racial group.

===Roman Empire===

Relations between the Jews in Judea and the occupying Roman Empire were antagonistic from the very start and they resulted in several rebellions. It has been argued that European antisemitism has its roots in the Roman policy of religious persecution.

Several ancient historians report that in 19 CE, the Roman emperor Tiberius expelled the Jews from Rome. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, Tiberius tried to suppress all foreign religions. In the case of the Jews, he sent young Jewish men, under the pretence of military service, to provinces which were noted for their unhealthy climate. He expelled all other Jews from the city, under threat of lifelong slavery for non-compliance. Josephus, in his &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot;, confirms that Tiberius ordered all Jews to be banished from Rome. Four thousand Jews were sent to Sardinia but more Jews, who were unwilling to become soldiers, were punished. Cassius Dio reports that Tiberius banished most of the Jews, who had been attempting to convert the Romans to their religion. Philo of Alexandria reported that Sejanus, one of Tiberius&#x27;s lieutenants, may have been a prime mover in the persecution of the Jews.

The Romans refused to permit the Jews to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem after its destruction by Titus in 70 CE, imposed a tax on the Jews (Fiscus Judaicus) at the same time, ostensibly to finance the construction of the Temple of Jupiter in Rome, and renamed Judaea to Syria Palestina. The Jerusalem Talmud relates that, following the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), the Romans killed many Jews, &quot;killing until their horses were submerged in blood to their nostrils&quot;. However, some historians argue that Rome brutally suppressed revolts in all of its conquered territories and they also point out that Tiberius expelled all adherents of foreign religions from Rome, not just the Jews.

Some accommodations, in fact, were later made with Judaism, and the Jews of the Diaspora had privileges that others did not have. Unlike other subjects of the Roman Empire, the Jews had the right to maintain their religion and they were not expected to accommodate themselves to local customs. Even after the First Jewish–Roman War, the Roman authorities refused to rescind Jewish privileges in some cities. And although Hadrian outlawed circumcision as a form of mutilation which was normally inflicted upon people who were unable to consent to it, he later exempted the Jews from the ban on circumcision. According to the 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon, there was greater tolerance of the Jews from about 160 CE. Between 355 and 363 CE, Julian the Apostate permitted the Jews to rebuild the Second Temple of Jerusalem.

==Rise of Christianity and Islam==
===The New Testament and early Christianity===
Although most of the New Testament was written, ostensibly, by Jews who became followers of Jesus, there are a number of passages in the New Testament that some consider antisemitic, and they have been used for antisemitic purposes, including:
* Jesus speaking to a group of Pharisees: &quot;I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you ... You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&#x27;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him.&quot; (John 8:37–39, 44–47, RSV)
* After Pilate washes his hands and declares himself innocent of Jesus&#x27; blood, the Jewish crowd answers him, &quot;His blood be on us and on our children!&quot; (Matthew 27:25, RSV). In an essay regarding antisemitism, biblical scholar Amy-Jill Levine argues that this passage has caused more Jewish suffering throughout history than any other passage in the New Testament.
* Saint Stephen speaking before a synagogue council just before his execution: &quot;You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.&quot; (Acts 7:51–53, RSV)

=== Muhammad, the Quran, and early Islam ===
The Quran, the holy book of Muslims, contains some verses that can be interpreted as expressing very negative views of some Jews. After the Islamic prophet Muhammad moved to Medina in 622 CE, he made peace treaties with the Jewish tribes of Arabia and other tribes. However, the relationship between the followers of the new religion and the Jews of Medina later became bitter. At this point the Quran instructs Muhammad to change the direction of prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca, and from this point on, the tone of the verses of the Quran become increasingly hostile towards Jewry.

In 627 CE, Jewish tribe Banu Qurayza of Medina violated a treaty with Muhammad by allying with the attacking tribes. Subsequently, the tribe was charged with treason and besieged by the Muslims commanded by Muhammad himself. The Banu Qurayza were forced to surrender and the men were beheaded, while all the women and children were taken captive and enslaved. Several scholars have challenged the veracity of this incident, arguing that it was exaggerated or invented. Later, several conflicts arose between Jews of Arabia and Muhammad and his followers, the most notable of which was in Khaybar, in which many Jews were killed and their properties seized and distributed among the Muslims.

==Late Roman Empire==
When Christianity became the state religion of Rome in the 4th century, Jews became the victims of religious intolerance and political oppression. Christian literature began to display extreme hostility towards Jews, which occasionally resulted in attacks against them and the burning of their synagogues. The hostility against Jews was reflected in the edicts which were imposed upon them by church councils and state laws. In the early 4th century, intermarriage between unconverted Jews and Christians was prohibited by the provisions of the Synod of Elvira. The Council of Antioch (341) prohibited Christians from celebrating Passover with the Jews while the Council of Laodicea forbade Christians from keeping the Jewish Sabbath. The Roman Emperor Constantine I instituted several laws concerning the Jews: they were forbidden to own Christian slaves and they were also forbidden to circumcise their slaves. The conversion of Christians to Judaism was also outlawed. Religious services were regulated, congregations were restricted, but Jews were allowed to enter Jerusalem on Tisha B&#x27;Av, the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple.

Discrimination against Jews became worse in the 5th century. The edicts of the Codex Theodosianus (438) barred Jews from the civil service, the army and the legal profession. The Jewish Patriarchate was abolished and the scope of Jewish courts was restricted. Synagogues were confiscated and old synagogues could only be repaired if they were in danger of collapsing. Synagogues fell into ruin or they were converted to churches. Synagogues were destroyed in Tortona (350), Rome (388 and 500), Raqqa (388), Menorca (418), Daphne (near Antioch, 489 and 507), Genoa (500), Ravenna (495), Tours (585) and in Orléans (590). Other synagogues were confiscated: Urfa in 411, several in Judea between 419 and 422, Constantinople in 442 and 569, Antioch in 423, Vannes in 465, Diyarbakir in 500 Terracina in 590, Cagliari in 590 and Palermo in 590.

===Accusations that the Jews killed Jesus===
Deicide is the killing of a god. In the context of Christianity, deicide refers to the responsibility for the death of Jesus. The accusation that the Jews committed deicide has been the most powerful warrant for antisemitism by Christians. The earliest recorded instance of an accusation of deicide against the Jewish people as a whole – that they were collectively responsible for the death of Jesus – occurs in a sermon of 167 CE attributed to Melito of Sardis entitled &quot;Peri Pascha&quot;, &quot;On the Passover&quot;. This text blames the Jews for allowing King Herod and Caiaphas to execute Jesus. Melito does not attribute particular blame to Pontius Pilate, he only mentions that Pilate washed his hands of guilt. The Latin word (slayer of god), from which the word &quot;deicide&quot; is derived, was used in the 4th century by Peter Chrystologus in his sermon number 172. Though not part of Roman Catholic dogma, many Christians, including members of the clergy, once held Jews collectively responsible for the death of Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews who were present at Jesus&#x27; death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time had committed the sin of deicide, or God-killing.

==Middle Ages==
Hostility to Judaism continued from the late Roman period into medieval times. During the Middle Ages in Europe there was a full-scale persecution of Jews in many places, with blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and killings. In the 12th century, there were Christians who believed that some, or possibly all, of the Jews possessed magical powers and had gained these powers from making a pact with the devil. Judensau images began to appear in Germany.

Although the Catholicised Visigothic kingdom in Spain issued a series of anti-Jewish edicts already in the 7th century, persecution of Jews in Europe reached a climax during the Crusades. Anti-Jewish rhetoric such as the &quot;Goad of Love&quot; began to appear and affect public consciousness. At the time of the First Crusade, in 1096, a German Crusade destroyed flourishing Jewish communities on the Rhine and the Danube. In the Second Crusade in 1147, the Jews in France were the victims of frequent killings and atrocities. Following the coronation of Richard the Lionheart in 1189, Jews were attacked in London. When king Richard left to join the Third Crusade in 1190, anti-Jewish riots broke out again in York and throughout England. In the first large-scale persecution in Germany after the First Crusade, 100,000 Jews were killed by Rintfleisch knights in 1298. The Jews were also subjected to attacks during the Shepherds&#x27; Crusades of 1251 and 1320. In the 1330s Jews were assaulted by the Armleder, led by Arnold von Uissigheim, starting in 1336 in Franconia and subsequently by John Zimberlin during 1338–9 in Alsace who attacked more than one hundred Jewish communities. Following these crusades, Jews were subject to expulsions, including, in 1290, the banishing of all English Jews. In 1396, 100,000 Jews were expelled from France and in 1421, thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of those expelled fled to Poland.

As the Black Death plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half of the population, Jews often became the scapegoats. Rumors spread that they had caused this epidemic by deliberately poisoning wells, an accusation that appeared before in the 1321 leper scare. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by the ensuing hatred and violence. Pope Clement VI tried to protect Jews by a papal bull dated July 6, 1348, and by an additional bull soon afterwards, but several months later, 900 Jews were burnt alive in Strasbourg, where the plague had not yet affected the city. The Jews of Prague were attacked on Easter of 1389. The massacres of 1391 marked a decline in the Golden Age for Spanish Jewry.

===Relations between Muslims and Jews in the Islamic world===

From the 9th century onwards, the medieval Islamic world imposed &quot;dhimmi&quot; status on Christian and Jewish minorities. Nevertheless, Jews were granted more freedom to practise their religion in the Muslim world than they were in Christian Europe. Jewish communities in Spain thrived under tolerant Muslim rule during the Spanish Golden Age and Cordova became a centre of Jewish culture.

With the entrance of the Almoravides from North Africa in the 11th century, however, harsh measures were taken against both Christians and Jews. As part of this repression there were pogroms against Jews in Cordova in 1011 and in Granada in 1066. The Almohads, who by 1147 had taken control of the Almoravids&#x27; Maghribi and Andalusian territories, took a less tolerant view still and treated the &quot;dhimmis&quot; harshly. Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, many Jews and Christians took a third option if they could, and fled. Some, such as the family of Maimonides, went east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms. At certain times in the Middle Ages, in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted. Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face death in parts of Yemen, Morocco and Baghdad. 6,000 Jews were killed by a Muslim mob during the 1033 Fez massacre. There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465, and in Marrakesh in 1146 and 1232.

===Occupational and other restrictions===
Restrictions upon Jewish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to Jews, pushing them into marginal roles which were considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending, occupations which were only tolerated as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. At that time, Catholic doctrine taught the view that lending money for interest was a sin, and an occupation which Christians were forbidden to engage in. Not being subject to this restriction, insofar as loans to non-Jews were concerned, Jews made this business their own, despite possible criticism of usury in the Torah and later sections of the Hebrew Bible. This led to many negative stereotypes of Jews as insolent, greedy usurers and the tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could see them as personally taking their money while unaware of those on whose behalf these Jews worked.

Jews were subject to a wide range of legal disabilities and restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Even moneylending and peddling were at times forbidden to them. The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in ghettos and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own and were forced to swear special Jewish Oaths, and they suffered a variety of other measures. The Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 decreed that Jews and Muslims must wear distinguishing clothing. The most common such clothing was the Jewish hat, which was already worn by many Jews as a self-identifying mark, but was now often made compulsory.

The Jewish badge was introduced in some places; it could be a coloured piece of cloth in the shape of a circle, strip, or the tablets of the law (in England), and was sewn onto the clothes. Elsewhere special colours of robe were specified. Implementation was in the hands of local rulers but by the following century laws had been enacted covering most of Europe. In many localities, members of Medieval society wore badges to distinguish their social status. Some badges (such as those worn by guild members) were prestigious, while others were worn by ostracised outcasts such as lepers, reformed heretics and prostitutes. As with all sumptuary laws, the degree to which these laws were followed and enforced varied greatly. Sometimes, Jews sought to evade the badges by paying what amounted to bribes in the form of temporary &quot;exemptions&quot; to kings, which were revoked and re-paid for whenever the king needed to raise funds. By the end of the Middle Ages, the hat seems to have become rare, but the badge lasted longer and remained in some places until the 18th century.

===Crusades===

The Crusades were a series of military campaigns sanctioned by the Papacy in Rome, which took place from the end of the 11th century until the 13th century. They began as endeavors to recapture Jerusalem from the Muslims but developed into territorial wars.

The People&#x27;s Crusade that accompanied the First Crusade attacked Jewish communities in Germany, France, and England, and killed many Jews. Entire communities, like those of Treves, Speyer, Worms, Mainz, and Cologne, were murdered by armed mobs. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the Rhineland cities alone between May and July 1096. The religious zeal fomented by the Crusades at times burned as fiercely against Jews as against Muslims, although attempts were made by bishops during the first Crusade and by the papacy during the Second Crusade to stop Jews from being attacked. Both economically and socially, the Crusades were disastrous for European Jews. They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of Pope Innocent III.

The Jewish defenders of Jerusalem retreated to their synagogue to &quot;prepare for death&quot; once the Crusaders had breached the outer walls of the city during the siege of 1099. The chronicle of Ibn al-Qalanisi states that the building was set on fire while the Jews were still inside. The Crusaders were supposedly reported as hoisting up their shields and singing &quot;Christ We Adore Thee!&quot; while they encircled the burning building.&quot; Following the siege, Jews captured from the Dome of the Rock, along with native Christians, were made to clean the city of the slain. Numerous Jews and their holy books (including the Aleppo Codex) were held ransom by Raymond of Toulouse. The Karaite Jewish community of Ashkelon (Ascalon) reached out to their coreligionists in Alexandria to first pay for the holy books and then rescued pockets of Jews over several months. All that could be ransomed were liberated by the summer of 1100. The few who could not be rescued were either converted to Christianity or murdered.

In the County of Toulouse, in southern France, toleration and favour shown to Jews was one of the main complaints of the Roman Church against the Counts of Toulouse at the beginning of the 13th century. Organised and official persecution of the Jews became a normal feature of life in southern France only after the Albigensian Crusade, because it was only then that the Church became powerful enough to insist that measures of discrimination be applied. In 1209, stripped to the waist and barefoot, Raymond VI of Toulouse was obliged to swear that he would no longer allow Jews to hold public office. In 1229 his son Raymond VII underwent a similar ceremony. In 1236, Crusaders attacked the Jewish communities of Anjou and Poitou, killing 3,000 and baptizing 500. Two years after the 1240 disputation of Paris, twenty-four wagons piled with hand-written Talmudic manuscripts were burned in the streets. Other disputations occurred in Spain, followed by accusations against the Talmud.

=== Blood libels and host desecrations ===
On many occasions, Jews were accused of drinking the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian Eucharist. According to the authors of these so-called blood libels, the &#x27;procedure&#x27; for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child who had not yet reached puberty was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. The child would be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The child would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the child would be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from the child&#x27;s wounds would be caught in bowls or glasses and then drunk. Finally, the child would be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. Its dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of black magic would be performed on it. This method, with some variations, can be found in all the alleged Christian descriptions of ritual murder by Jews.

The story of William of Norwich (d. 1144) is often cited as the first known accusation of ritual murder against Jews. The Jews of Norwich, England were accused of murder after a Christian boy, William, was found dead. It was claimed that the Jews had tortured and crucified him. The legend of William of Norwich became a cult, and the child acquired the status of a holy martyr. Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln (d. 1255), in the 13th century, reputedly had his belly cut open and his entrails removed for some occult purpose, such as a divination ritual, after being taken from a cross. Simon of Trent (d. 1475), in the fifteenth century, was held over a large bowl so that all of his blood could be collected, it was alleged.

During the Middle Ages, such blood libels were directed against Jews in many parts of Europe. The believers in these false accusations reasoned that the Jews, having crucified Jesus, continued to thirst for pure and innocent blood, at the expense of innocent Christian children. Jews were also sometimes falsely accused of desecrating consecrated hosts in a reenactment of the Crucifixion; this crime was known as host desecration and it carried the death penalty.

===Expulsions from France and England===

The practice of expelling Jews, the confiscation of their property and further ransom for their return was used to enrich the French crown during the 13th and 14th centuries. The most notable such expulsions were from Paris by Philip Augustus in 1182, from the whole of France by Louis IX in 1254, by Philip IV in 1306, by Charles IV in 1322 and by Charles VI in 1394.

Jewish expulsions inside England took place in Bury St. Edmunds in 1190, Newcastle in 1234, Wycombe in 1235, Southampton in 1236, Berkhamsted in 1242 and Newbury in 1244. Simon de Montfort banished the Jews of Leicester in 1231. During the Second Barons&#x27; War in the 1260s, Simon de Montfort&#x27;s followers ravaged the Jewries of London, Canterbury, Northampton, Winchester, Cambridge, Worcester and Lincoln in an effort to destroy the records of their debts to moneylenders. To finance his war against Wales in 1276, Edward I of England taxed Jewish moneylenders. When the moneylenders could no longer pay the tax, they were accused of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, Edward abolished their &quot;privilege&quot; to lend money, restricted their movements and activities and forced Jews to wear a yellow patch. The heads of Jewish households were then arrested with over 300 being taken to the Tower of London and executed. Others were killed in their homes. All Jews were banished from the country in 1290, where it was possible that hundreds were killed or drowned while trying to leave the country. All the money and property of these dispossessed Jews was confiscated. No Jews were known to be in England thereafter until 1655, when Oliver Cromwell reversed the policy.

===Expulsions from the Holy Roman Empire===

In Germany, part of the Holy Roman Empire, persecutions and formal expulsions of the Jews were liable to occur at intervals, although it should be said that this was also the case for other minority communities, whether religious or ethnic. There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution in the Rhineland massacres of 1096 accompanying the lead-up to the First Crusade, many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils. The Holy Roman Emperor generally tried to restrain persecution, if only for economic reasons, but he was often unable to exert much influence. As late as 1519, the Imperial city of Regensburg took advantage of the recent death of Emperor Maximilian I to expel its 500 Jews. At this period the rulers of the eastern edges of Europe, in Poland, Lithuania and Hungary, were often receptive to Jewish settlement, and many Jews moved to these regions.

===The Black Death===

Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence during the ravages of the Black Death, particularly in the Iberian peninsula and in the Germanic Empire. In Provence, 40 Jews were burnt in Toulon as quickly after the outbreak as April 1348. &quot;Never mind that Jews were not immune from the ravages of the plague; they were tortured until they &#x27;confessed&#x27; to crimes that they could not possibly have committed. In one such case, a man named Agimet was ... coerced to say that Rabbi Peyret of Chambéry (near Geneva) had ordered him to poison the wells in Venice, Toulouse, and elsewhere. In the aftermath of Agimet&#x27;s &#x27;confession&#x27;, the Jews of Strasbourg were burned alive on February 14, 1349.&quot;

==Early modern period==

===Spain and Portugal===

In the Catholic kingdoms of late medieval and early modern Spain, oppressive policies and attitudes led many Jews to embrace Christianity. Such Jews were known as conversos or Marranos. Suspicions that they might still secretly be adherents of Judaism led Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile to institute the Spanish Inquisition. The Inquisition used torture to elicit confessions and delivered judgment at public ceremonials known as &quot;autos de fe&quot; before they gave their victims over to the secular authorities for punishment. Under this dispensation, some 30,000 were condemned to death and executed by being burnt alive. In 1492, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile issued an edict of expulsion of Jews from Spain, giving Jews four months to either convert to Christianity or leave the country. Some 165,000 emigrated and some 50,000 converted to Christianity. The same year the order of expulsion arrived in Sicily and Sardinia, belonging to Spain.

Portugal followed suit in December 1496. However, those expelled could only leave the country in ships specified by the King. When those who chose to leave the country arrived at the port in Lisbon, they were met by clerics and soldiers who used force, coercion and promises to baptize them and prevent them from leaving the country. This episode technically ended the presence of Jews in Portugal. Afterwards, all converted Jews and their descendants would be referred to as New Christians or Conversos, and those were rumoured to practice crypto-Judaism were pejoratively labelled as &quot;Marranos&quot;. They were given a grace period of thirty years during which no inquiry into their faith would be allowed. This period was later extended until 1534. However, a popular riot in 1506 resulted in the deaths of up to four or five thousand Jews, and the execution of the leaders of the riot by King Manuel. Those labeled as New Christians were under the surveillance of the Portuguese Inquisition from 1536 until 1821.

Jewish refugees from Spain and Portugal, known as Sephardi Jews from the Hebrew word for Spain, fled to North Africa, Turkey and Palestine within the Ottoman Empire, and to Holland, France and Italy. Within the Ottoman Empire, Jews could openly practise their religion. Amsterdam in Holland also became a focus for settlement by the persecuted Jews from many lands in succeeding centuries. In the Papal states, Jews were forced to live in ghettos and subjected to several restrictions as part of the Cum nimis absurdum of 1555.

===Anti-Judaism and the Reformation===

Martin Luther, a Lutheran Augustinian friar excommunicated by the Papacy for heresy, and an ecclesiastical reformer whose teachings inspired the Reformation, wrote antagonistically about Jews in his pamphlet &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot;, written in 1543. He portrays the Jews in extremely harsh terms, excoriates them and provides detailed recommendations for a pogrom against them, calling for their permanent oppression and expulsion. At one point he writes: &quot;...we are at fault in not slaying them...&quot; a passage that &quot;may be termed the first work of modern antisemitism, and a giant step forward on the road to the Holocaust.&quot;

Luther&#x27;s harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a continuation of medieval Christian antisemitism. Muslow and Popkin assert that, &quot;the antisemitism of the early modern period was even worse than that of the Middle Ages; and nowhere was this more obvious than in those areas which roughly encompass modern-day Germany, especially among Lutherans.&quot; In his final sermon shortly before his death, however, Luther preached: &quot;We want to treat them with Christian love and to pray for them, so that they might become converted and would receive the Lord.&quot;

===Canonization of Simon of Trent===
Simon of Trent was a boy from the city of Trento, Italy, who was found dead at the age of two in 1475, having allegedly been kidnapped, mutilated, and drained of blood. His disappearance was blamed on the leaders of the city&#x27;s Jewish community, based on confessions extracted under torture, in a case that fueled the rampant antisemitism of the time. Simon was regarded as a saint, and was canonized by Pope Sixtus V in 1588.
==Seventeenth century==

During the 1614 Fettmilch uprising, mobs led by Vincenz Fettmilch looted the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt, expelling Jews from the city. Two years later emperor Matthias executed Fettmilch and made the Jews return to the city under protection by imperial soldiers.

In the mid-17th century, Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Director-General of the colony of New Amsterdam, later New York City, sought to bolster the position of the Dutch Reformed Church by trying to stem the religious influence of Jews, Lutherans, Catholics and Quakers. He stated that Jews were &quot;deceitful&quot;, &quot;very repugnant&quot;, and &quot;hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ&quot;. However, religious plurality was already a cultural tradition and a legal obligation in New Amsterdam and in the Netherlands, and his superiors at the Dutch West India Company in Amsterdam overruled him.

The Caribbean offered Jews amongst the most freedoms of any place in the 17th century world. By the mid-century, Jews became a constant presence in the West Indian colonies, particularly those under British rule. The dearth of resources and lack of common will to establish a strong Church presence in the colonies allowed many Jews to acquire Letters of Denization, granting them the status of English subjects. Nonetheless, Jews in colonies like Jamaica were subject to higher additional taxes, were prohibited from holding public office, and could not serve in the militia. In 1661, Merchants in Barbados petitioned for Jews to be barred from trade “the Jews are a people so subtle in matters of trade” continuing “that in a short time they will not only ingross trade among themselves, but will be able to divert the benefit thereof to other places.” Such antisemitic attitudes caused many Jews to settle in the Leeward Islands; however, even across smaller colonies, Jews continued to be treated as second-class citizens.

During the mid-to-late-17th century the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people). The decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, including emigration, deaths from diseases and captivity in the Ottoman Empire. These conflicts began in 1648 when Bohdan Khmelnytsky instigated the Khmelnytsky uprising against the Polish aristocracy and the Jews who administered their estates. Khmelnytsky&#x27;s Cossacks massacred tens of thousands of Jews in the eastern and southern areas that he controlled (now Ukraine). This persecution led many Jews to pin their hopes on a man called Shabbatai Zevi who emerged in the Ottoman Empire at this time and proclaimed himself Messiah in 1665. However, his later conversion to Islam dashed these hopes and led many Jews to discredit the traditional belief in the coming of the Messiah as the hope of salvation.

In the Zaydi imamate of Yemen, Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of Tihamah and which became known as the Mawza Exile.

==Eighteenth century==
In many European countries the 18th century &quot;Age of Enlightenment&quot; saw the dismantling of archaic corporate, hierarchical forms of society in favour of individual equality of citizens before the law. How this new state of affairs would affect previously autonomous, though subordinated, Jewish communities became known as the Jewish question. In many countries, enhanced civil rights were gradually extended to the Jews, though often only in a partial form and on condition that the Jews abandon many aspects of their previous identity in favour of integration and assimilation with the dominant society.

According to Arnold Ages, Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative&quot;. Paul H. Meyer adds: &quot;There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his later years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France.&quot; Thirty of the 118 articles in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot; concerned Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.

In 1744, Frederick II of Prussia limited the number of Jews allowed to live in Breslau to only ten so-called &quot;protected&quot; Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other Prussian cities. In 1750 he issued the &quot;Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft&quot;: forcing these &quot;protected&quot; Jews to &quot;either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin.&quot; In the same year, Archduchess of Austria Maria Theresa ordered Jews out of Bohemia but soon reversed her position, on condition that they pay for their readmission every ten years. This was known among the Jews as &quot;malke-geld&quot; (queen&#x27;s money). In 1752 she introduced a law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, Joseph II abolished most of these practices in his &quot;Toleranzpatent&quot;, on the condition that Yiddish and Hebrew were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. In 1768, thousands of Jews were killed by Cossack Haidamaks during the massacre of Uman in the Kingdom of Poland.

Jews in Switzerland were greatly restricted in their freedom of work, movement and settlement, and in the 17th century, Aargau was the only federal condominium where they were tolerated. In 1774, the Jews were restricted to just two towns, Endingen and Lengnau. While the rural upper class pressed incessantly for their expulsion, the financial interests of the authorities prevented it. They imposed special taxes on peddling and cattle trading, the primary Jewish professions. The Jews were directly subordinate to the governor; from 1696, they were compelled to renew a (costly) letter of protection every 16 years.

During this period, Jews and Christians were not allowed to live under the same roof, nor were Jews allowed to own land or houses. They were taxed at a much higher rate than others and, in 1712, a pogrom took place in Lengnau, resulting in considerable property destruction. In 1760, they were further restricted regarding marriages and procreation. An exorbitant tax was levied on marriage licenses; oftentimes, they were outright refused. This remained the case until the 19th century.

In accordance with the anti-Jewish precepts of the Russian Orthodox Church, Russia&#x27;s discriminatory policies towards Jews intensified when the partition of Poland in the 18th century resulted, for the first time in Russian history, in the possession of land with a large population of Jews. This land was designated as the Pale of Settlement from which Jews were forbidden to migrate into the interior of Russia. In 1772, the empress of Russia Catherine II forced the Jews of the Pale of Settlement to stay in their shtetls and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the partition of Poland.

==Nineteenth century==
Following legislation supporting the equality of French Jews with other citizens during the French Revolution, similar laws promoting Jewish emancipation were enacted in the early 19th century in those parts of Europe over which France had influence. The old laws restricting them to ghettos, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded.

Despite laws granting legal and political equality to Jews in a number of countries, traditional cultural discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by racial antisemitism.

===Catholic counter-revolution===
Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by racial antisemitism, encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as the royalist Joseph Arthur de Gobineau and particularly his &quot;Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race&quot; of 1853–55. Nationalist agendas based on ethnicity, known as ethnonationalism, usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race. Allied to this were theories of Social Darwinism, which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by white Europeans, advocated the superiority of white Aryans to Semitic Jews.

The counter-revolutionary Catholic royalist Louis de Bonald stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the French Revolution. Bonald&#x27;s attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced Napoleon&#x27;s decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews. Bonald&#x27;s article &quot;Sur les juifs&quot; (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux, Charles Maurras, and Édouard Drumont, nationalists such as Maurice Barrès and Paolo Orano, and antisemitic socialists such as Alphonse Toussenel and Henry Hyndman. Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an &quot;alien&quot; people, a &quot;state within a state&quot;, and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.

In the 1840s, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist Louis Veuillot propagated Bonald&#x27;s arguments against the Jewish &quot;financial aristocracy&quot; along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a &quot;deicidal people&quot; driven by hatred to &quot;enslave&quot; Christians. Gougenot des Mousseaux&#x27;s &quot;Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens&quot; (1869) has been called a &quot;Bible of modern antisemitism&quot; and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg. In Italy, the Jesuit priest Antonio Bresciani&#x27;s highly popular novel 1850 novel &quot;L&#x27;Ebreo di Verona&quot; (The Jew of Verona) shaped religious antisemitism for decades, as did his work for &quot;La Civiltà Cattolica&quot;, which he helped launch. In the Papal States, Jews were baptized involuntarily, and, even when such baptisms were illegal, forced to practice the Christian religion. In some cases, the state separated them from their families, of which the Edgardo Mortara account is one of the most widely publicized instances of acrimony between Catholics and Jews in the second half of the 19th century.

===Germany===
Civil rights granted to Jews in Germany, following the occupation of that country by the French under Napoleon, were rescinded after his defeat. Pleas to retain them by diplomats at the Congress of Vienna peace conference (1814–5) were unsuccessful. In 1819, German Jews were attacked in the Hep-Hep riots. Full Jewish emancipation was not granted in Germany until 1871, when the country was united under the Hohenzollern dynasty.

In his 1843 essay &quot;On the Jewish Question&quot;, Karl Marx used the stereotype of the practical &quot;huckstering&quot; Jew as an example of a historical trend towards the dominance of Capital. In 1850, German composer Richard Wagner published (&quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;) under a pseudonym in the . The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner&#x27;s contemporaries (and rivals) Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer, but expanded to accuse Jewish influences more widely of being a harmful and alien element in German culture.

The term &quot;antisemitism&quot; was coined by the German agitator and publicist, Wilhelm Marr in 1879. In that year, Marr founded the Antisemites League and published a book called &quot;Victory of Jewry over Germandom&quot;. The late 1870s saw the growth of antisemitic political parties in Germany. These included the Christian Social Party, founded in 1878 by Adolf Stoecker, the Lutheran chaplain to Kaiser Wilhelm I, as well as the German Social Antisemitic Party and the Antisemitic People&#x27;s Party. However, they did not enjoy mass electoral support and at their peak in 1907, had only 16 deputies out of a total of 397 in the parliament. Despite personal issues with political antisemitism, in his 1887 work &quot;On the Genealogy of Morals&quot; German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche attributes the &quot;degeneration and diminution of man to the perfect herd animal&quot; to the deterimental effects of Christianity, which he attributes to a Jewish conspiracy, saying: &quot;With regard to the huge and incalculably disastrous initiative taken by the Jews with this most fundamental of all declarations of war [...] the slaves’ revolt in morality begins with the Jews: a revolt which has two thousand years of history behind it and which has only been lost sight of because – it was victorious&quot;

===France===
The defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) was blamed by some on the Jews. Jews were accused of weakening the national spirit through association with republicanism, capitalism and anti-clericalism, particularly by authoritarian, right wing, clerical and royalist groups. These accusations were spread in antisemitic journals such as &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;, founded by Edouard Drumont and &quot;La Croix&quot;, the organ of the Catholic order of the Assumptionists. Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France&#x27;s ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.

Financial scandals such as the collapse of the Union Generale Bank and the collapse of the French Panama Canal operation were also blamed on the Jews. The Dreyfus affair saw a Jewish military officer named Captain Alfred Dreyfus falsely accused of treason in 1895 by his army superiors and sent to Devil&#x27;s Island after being convicted. Dreyfus was acquitted in 1906, but the case polarised French opinion between antisemitic authoritarian nationalists and philosemitic anti-clerical republicans, with consequences which were to resonate into the 20th century.

=== Switzerland ===
Having been restricted in their rights of work and movement since the Middle Ages, on 5 May 1809, Jews were finally declared Swiss citizens and given limited rights regarding trade and farming. They were still restricted to Endingen and Lengnau until 7 May 1846, when their right to move and reside freely within the canton of Aargau was granted. On 24 September 1856, the Swiss Federal Council granted them full political rights within Aargau, as well as broad business rights; however, the majority Christian population did not fully abide by these new liberal laws. The time of 1860 saw the canton government voting to grant suffrage in all local rights and to give their communities autonomy. Before the law was enacted however, it was repealed due to vocal opposition led by Johann Nepomuk Schleuniger and the Ultramonte Party. In 1866, a referendum granted all Jews full citizenship rights in Switzerland. However, they did not receive all of the rights in Endingen and Lengnau until a resolution of the Grand Council, on 15 May 1877, when Jewish citizens were given charters under the names of New Endingen and New Lengnau, finally granting them full citizenship.

===United States===

Between 1881 and 1920, approximately three million Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe migrated to America, many of them fleeing pogroms and the difficult economic conditions which were widespread in much of Eastern Europe during this time. Many Americans distrusted these Jewish immigrants. Along with Italians, Irish and other Eastern and Southern Europeans, Jews faced discrimination in the United States in employment, education and social advancement. American groups like the Immigration Restriction League, criticized these new arrivals along with immigrants from Asia and southern and eastern Europe, as culturally, intellectually, morally, and biologically inferior. Despite these attacks, very few Eastern European Jews returned to Europe for whatever privations they faced, their situation in the U.S. was still improved.

Beginning in the early 1880s, declining farm prices also prompted elements of the Populist movement to blame the perceived evils of capitalism and industrialism on Jews because of their alleged racial/religious inclination for financial exploitation and, more specifically, because of the alleged financial manipulations of Jewish financiers such as the Rothschilds. Although Jews played only a minor role in the nation&#x27;s commercial banking system, the prominence of Jewish investment bankers such as the Rothschilds in Europe, and Jacob Schiff, of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. in New York City, made the claims of antisemites believable to some. The Morgan Bonds scandal injected populist antisemitism into the 1896 presidential campaign. It was disclosed that the government of President Grover Cleveland had sold bonds to a syndicate which included J. P. Morgan and the Rothschilds house, bonds which that syndicate was now selling for a profit. The Populists used it as an opportunity to prove that Washington and Wall Street were in the hands of the international Jewish banking houses. Another focus of antisemitic feeling was the allegation that Jews were at the center of an international conspiracy to fix the currency and thus the economy to a single gold standard.

===Russia===
Since 1827, Jewish minors were conscripted into the cantonist schools for a 25-year military service. Policy towards Jews was liberalised somewhat under Tsar Alexander II, but antisemitic attitudes and long-standing repressive policies against Jews were intensified after Alexander II was assassinated on 13 March 1881, culminating in widespread anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire which lasted for three years. A hardening of official attitudes under Tsar Alexander III and his ministers, resulted in the May Laws of 1882, which severely restricted the civil rights of Jews within the Russian Empire. The Tsar&#x27;s minister Konstantin Petrovich Pobedonostsev stated that the aim of the government with regard to the Jews was that: &quot;One third will die out, one third will leave the country and one third will be completely dissolved [into] the surrounding population&quot;. In the event, a mix of pogroms and repressive legislation did indeed result in the mass emigration of Jews to western Europe and America. Between 1881 and the outbreak of the First World War, an estimated two and half million Jews left Russia – one of the largest mass migrations in recorded history.

===The Muslim world===
Historian Martin Gilbert writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries. According to Mark Cohen in &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies&quot;, most scholars conclude that Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the 19th century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalisms, and it was primarily imported into the Arab world by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it &quot;Islamized&quot;).

Hundreds of Algerian Jews were killed in 1805. There was a massacre of Iraqi Jews in Baghdad in 1828. In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of Meshed, a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue and destroyed the Torah scrolls, and it was only by forced conversion that a massacre was averted. There was a massacre of Jews in Barfurush in 1867. In 1840, in the Damascus affair, the Jews of Damascus were falsely accused of having ritually murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having used their blood to bake Passover bread. In 1859, some 400 Jews in Morocco were killed in Mogador. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in Marrakech and Fez in Morocco. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in Tunis, and an Arab mob looted Jewish homes and stores, and burned synagogues, on Jerba Island.

Concerning the life of Persian Jews in the middle of the 19th century, a contemporary author wrote:

...they are obliged to live in a separate part of town... for they are considered as unclean creatures... Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt... For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans... If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him... unmercifully... If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods... Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them.

One symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. A 19th-century traveler observed: &quot;I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish gaberdine. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan.&quot; In 1891, the leading Muslims in Jerusalem asked the Ottoman authorities in Constantinople to prohibit the entry of Jews arriving from Russia.

==Twentieth century==
In the 20th century, antisemitism and Social Darwinism culminated in a systematic campaign of genocide, called the Holocaust, in which some six million Jews were exterminated in German-occupied Europe between 1941 and 1945 under the National Socialist regime of Adolf Hitler.

===Russia===

In Russia, under the Tsarist regime, antisemitism intensified in the early years of the 20th century and was given official favour when the secret police forged the notorious &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a document purported to be a transcription of a plan by Jewish elders to achieve global domination. Violence against the Jews in the Kishinev pogrom in 1903 was continued after the 1905 revolution by the activities of the Black Hundreds. The Beilis Trial of 1913 showed that it was possible to revive the blood libel accusation in Russia.

The 1917 Bolshevik Revolution ended official discrimination against the Jews but was followed, however, by massive anti-Jewish violence by the anti-Bolshevik White Army and the forces of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in the Russian Civil War. From 1918 to 1921, between 100,000 and 150,000 Jews were slaughtered during the White Terror. White emigres from revolutionary Russia fostered the idea that the Bolshevik regime, with its many Jewish members, was a front for the global Jewish conspiracy, outlined in the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, which had by now achieved wide circulation in the west. The pogroms were committed not only by White forces, but also by Red forces, local warlords, and ordinary Ukrainian and Polish citizens.

=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, some antisemitism emerged in the form of the association of Jews to psychoanalysis beliefs during the 1930s and 40s. Psychoanalysis was invented by Austrian neurologist, Sigmund Freud, whose ideas were often associated with Jews and Jewishness. Prominent Catholic priests, such as Virgilio Filippo, attacked Freudian psychoanalysis by claiming that it was an ideology created to suppress Argentine society and undermine the Catholic Church. Filippo viewed psychoanalysis as part of a Jewish plan to dominate by sexual means. Filippo linked Freud’s Jewishness to his sexual perversion as “related to the sexual perversion of the Jewish physiological constitution.” Antisemitism was also prevalent in texts from Christian writers; a popular one being Gustavo Martínez Zuviría or &quot;Hugo Wast.&quot; Writers like Huge Wast wrote political essays to &quot;expose&quot; Jews for their destructive force in Argentina and in the world. Wast wrote a two-part novel titled &quot;Kahal&quot; (Congregation) and &quot;Oro&quot; (Gold), where the &quot;Kahal&quot; plot was inspired by conspiracy theories and Jewish tropes of Jews taking control of the economy, media, culture, and government, much like the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion.&quot; Filippo&#x27;s antisemitism was a combination of traditional Catholic antisemitism, like Hugo Wast&#x27;s work, and racial antisemitism based on the ideas of Freudian psychoanalysis and its connection to Jewish biological makeup.

===France===
In France, antisemitic agitation was promoted by right-wing groups such as Action Française, founded by Charles Maurras. These groups were critical of the whole political establishment of the Third Republic. Following the Stavisky Affair, in which a Jewish man named Serge Alexandre Stavisky was revealed to be involved in high-level political corruption, these groups encouraged serious rioting which almost toppled the government in the 6 February 1934 crisis. The rise to prominence of the Jewish socialist Léon Blum, who became prime minister of the Popular Front Government in 1936, further polarised opinion within France. Action Française and other right-wing groups launched a vicious antisemitic press campaign against Blum which culminated in an attack in which he was dragged from his car and kicked and beaten while a mob screamed &#x27;Death to the Jew!&#x27; Catholic writers such as Ernest Jouin, who published the &quot;Protocols&quot; in French, seamlessly blended racial and religious antisemitism, as in his statement that &quot;from the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity.&quot; Pope Pius XI praised Jouin for &quot;combating our mortal [Jewish] enemy&quot; and appointed him to high papal office as a protonotary apostolic.

Antisemitism was particularly virulent in Vichy France during World War II. The Vichy government openly collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to identify Jews for deportation. The antisemitic demands of right-wing groups were implemented under the collaborating Vichy regime of Marshal Philippe Pétain, following the defeat of the French by the German army in 1940. A law on the status of Jews of that year, followed by another in 1941, purged Jews from employment in administrative, civil service and judicial posts, from most professions and even from the entertainment industryrestricting them, mostly, to menial jobs. Vichy officials detained some 75,000 Jews who were then handed over to the Germans; approximated 72,500 Jews were murdered during the Holocaust in France.

===Nazism and the Holocaust===


In Germany, following World War I, Nazism arose as a political movement incorporating racially antisemitic ideas, expressed by Adolf Hitler in his book (). After Hitler came to power in 1933, the Nazi regime sought the systematic exclusion of Jews from national life. Jews were demonized as the driving force of both international Marxism and capitalism. The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 outlawed marriage or sexual relationships between Jews and non-Jews. Antisemitic propaganda by or on behalf of the Nazi Party began to pervade society. Especially virulent in this regard was Julius Streicher&#x27;s publication , which published the alleged sexual misdemeanors of Jews for popular consumption. Mass violence against the Jews was encouraged by the Nazi regime, and on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed Kristallnacht, the regime sanctioned the killing of Jews, the destruction of property and the torching of synagogues. Already prior to the new European war, German authorities started rounding up thousands of Jews for their first concentration camps while many other German Jews fled the country or were forced to emigrate.

As Nazi control extended in the course of World War II, antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were brought to occupied Europe, often building on local antisemitic traditions. In the German-occupied Poland, where over three million Jews had lived before the war in the largest Jewish population in Europe, Polish Jews were forced into newly established prison ghettos in 1940, including the Warsaw Ghetto for almost half million Jews. Following the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, a systematic campaign of mass murder in that country was conducted against Soviet Jews (including former Polish Jews from Soviet-annexed territories) by Nazi death squads called the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, murdering over one million Jews and marking a turn from persecution to extermination. In all, some six million Jews, about half of them from Poland, were murdered outright or indirectly through starvation, disease and overwork in German and collaborationist captivity between 1941 and 1945 in the genocide known as the Holocaust.

On 20 January 1942, Reinhard Heydrich, deputed to find a &quot;final solution to the Jewish question&quot;, chaired the Wannsee Conference at which all the ethnic Jews and many of part-Jews resident in Europe and North Africa were marked to be exterminated. To implement this plan, the Jews from Poland, Germany, and various other countries would be transported to purpose-built extermination camps set up by Nazis in the occupied Poland and in Germany-annexed territories, where they were mostly murdered in gas chambers immediately upon their arrival. These camps, located at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Chełmno, Bełżec, Majdanek, Sobibór and Treblinka, accounted for about half of the total number of Jewish victims of Nazism.

===United States===

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America&#x27;s shores, the bulk of them were from Eastern Europe. Where before 1900, American Jews never amounted to even 1 percent of America&#x27;s total population, by 1930 Jews formed about 3½ percent of America&#x27;s total population. This dramatic increase in the size of America&#x27;s Jewish community and the upward mobility of some Jews was accompanied by a resurgence of antisemitism.

In the first half of the 20th century, Jews in the United States faced discrimination in employment, in access to residential and resort areas, in membership in clubs and organizations and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrollment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. Some sources state that the conviction (and later the lynching) of Leo Frank, which turned a spotlight on antisemitism in the United States, also led to the formation of the Anti-Defamation League in October 1913. However, Abraham H. Foxman, the organization&#x27;s National Director, disputes this claim, stating that American Jews simply needed to found an institution that would combat antisemitism. The social tensions which existed during this period also led to renewed support for the Ku Klux Klan, which had been inactive since 1870.

Antisemitism in the United States reached its peak during the 1920s and 1930s. The pioneering automobile manufacturer Henry Ford propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper &quot;The Dearborn Independent&quot;. The pioneering aviator Charles Lindbergh and many other prominent Americans led the America First Committee in opposing any American involvement in the new war in Europe. However, America First&#x27;s leaders avoided saying or doing anything that would make them and their organization appear to be antisemitic and for this reason, they voted to drop Henry Ford as an America First member. Lindbergh gave a speech in Des Moines, Iowa in which he expressed the decidedly Ford-like view that: &quot;The three most important groups which have been pressing this country towards war are the British, the Jews, and the Roosevelt Administration.&quot; In his diary Lindbergh wrote: &quot;We must limit to a reasonable amount the Jewish influence... Whenever the Jewish percentage of the total population becomes too high, a reaction seems to invariably occur. It is too bad because a few Jews of the right type are, I believe, an asset to any country.&quot;

In the late 1930s, the German American Bund held parades which featured Nazi uniforms and flags with swastikas alongside American flags. At Madison Square Garden in 1939, some 20,000 people listened to the Bund leader Fritz Julius Kuhn as he criticized President Franklin Delano Roosevelt by repeatedly referring to him as &quot;Frank D. Rosenfeld&quot; and calling his New Deal the &quot;Jew Deal&quot;. Because he espoused a belief in the existence of a Bolshevik–Jewish conspiracy in America, Kuhn and his activities were scrutinized by the US House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and when the United States entered World War II most of the Bund&#x27;s members were placed in internment camps, and some of them were deported at the end of the war. Meanwhile, the United States government did not allow the MS &quot;St. Louis&quot; to enter the United States in 1939 because it was full of Jewish refugees. During race riot in Detroit in 1943, Jewish businesses were targeted for looting and burning.

===Eastern Europe after World War II===
Antisemitism in the Soviet Union reached a peak in 1948–1953 and culminated in the so-called Doctors&#x27; Plot that could have been a precursor to a general purge and a mass deportation of the Soviet Jews as nation. The country&#x27;s leading Yiddish-writing poets and writers were tortured and executed in a campaign against the so-called rootless cosmopolitans. The excesses largely ended with the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and the de-Stalinization of the Soviet Union. However, the discrimination against Jews had continued, leading to a mass emigration once it was allowed in the 1970s, followed by another during and after the breakup of the Soviet Union, mostly to Israel.

The Kielce pogrom and the Kraków pogrom in communist Poland were examples further incidents of antisemitic attitudes and violence in the Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe. A common theme behind the anti-Jewish violence in the immediate post-war period in Poland were blood libel rumours. Poland&#x27;s later &quot;March events&quot; of 1967–1968 was a state anti-Jewish (officially anti-Zionist) political campaign involving the suppression of the dissident movement and a power struggle within the Polish communist party against the background of the Six-Day War and the Soviet Union&#x27;s and the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s new radically anti-Israeli policy in support of socialist Arab countries. Both of these waves of antisemitism in Poland resulted in the emigration of most of the country&#x27;s Holocaust survivors during the late 1940s and in 1968, mostly to either Israel or the United States.

===United States after World War II===
During the early 1980s, isolationists on the far right made overtures to anti-war activists on the left in the United States to join forces against government policies in areas where they shared concerns. This was mainly in the area of civil liberties, opposition to United States military intervention overseas and opposition to U.S. support for Israel. As they interacted, some of the classic right-wing antisemitic scapegoating conspiracy theories began to seep into progressive circles, including stories about how a &quot;New World Order&quot;, also called the &quot;Shadow Government&quot; or &quot;The Octopus&quot;, was manipulating world governments. Antisemitic conspiracism was &quot;peddled aggressively&quot; by right-wing groups. Some on the left adopted the rhetoric, which it has been argued, was made possible by their lack of knowledge of the history of fascism and its use of &quot;scapegoating, reductionist and simplistic solutions, demagoguery, and a conspiracy theory of history.&quot; The Crown Heights riots of 1991 were a violent expression of tensions within a very poor urban community, pitting African American residents against followers of Hassidic Judaism.

Towards the end of 1990, as the movement against the Gulf War began to build, a number of far-right and antisemitic groups sought out alliances with left-wing anti-war coalitions, who began to speak openly about a &quot;Jewish lobby&quot; that was encouraging the United States to invade the Middle East. This idea evolved into conspiracy theories about a &quot;Zionist-occupied government&quot; (ZOG), which has been seen as equivalent to &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;.

===The Muslim world===

While Islamic antisemitism has increased in the wake of the Arab–Israeli conflict, there were riots against Jews in Middle Eastern countries prior to the foundation of Israel, including unrest in Casablanca, Shiraz and Fez in the 1910s, massacres in Jerusalem, Jaffa and broadly throughout Palestine in the 1920s, pogroms in Algeria, Turkey and Palestine in the 1930s, as well as attacks on the Jews of Iraq and Tunisia in the 1940s. As Palestinian Arab leader Amin al-Husseini decided to make an alliance with Hitler&#x27;s Germany during World War II, 180 Jews were killed and 700 Jews were injured in the Nazi-inspired riots of 1941 which are known as the Farhud. Jews in the Middle East were also affected by the Holocaust. Most of North Africa came under Nazi control and many Jews were discriminated against and used as slaves until the Axis defeat. In 1945, hundreds of Jews were injured during violent demonstrations in Egypt and Jewish property was vandalized and looted. In November 1945, 130 Jews were killed during a pogrom in Tripoli. In December 1947, shortly after the UN Partition Plan, Arab rioting resulted in hundreds of Jewish casualties in Aleppo, including 75 dead. In Aden, 87 Jews were killed and 120 injured. A mob of Muslim sailors looted Jewish homes and shops in Manama. During 1948 there were further riots against Jews in Tripoli, Cairo, Oujda and Jerada. As the first Arab–Israeli War came to an end in 1949, a grenade attack against the Menarsha Synagogue of Damascus claimed a dozen lives and thirty injured. The 1967 Six-Day War led to further persecution against Jews in the Arab world, prompting an increase in the Jewish exodus that began after Israel was established. Over the following years, Jewish population in Arab countries decreased from 856,000 in 1948 to 25,870 in 2009 as a result of emigration, mostly to Israel.

==Twenty-first century==

The first years of the 21st century have seen an upsurge of antisemitism. Several authors such as Robert S. Wistrich, Phyllis Chesler, and Jonathan Sacks argue that this is antisemitism of a new type stemming from Islamists, which they call new antisemitism. Blood libel stories have appeared numerous times in the state-sponsored media of a number of Arab nations, on Arab television shows, and on websites. Other scholars, such as Antony Lerman, contest the notion of new antisemitism.

In 2004, the United Kingdom set up an all-Parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. The inquiry stated that: &quot;Until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society.&quot; However, it found a reversal of this progress since 2000 and aimed to investigate the problem, identify the sources of contemporary antisemitism and make recommendations to improve the situation. A 2008 report by the U.S. State Department found that there was an increase in antisemitism across the world, and that both old and new expressions of antisemitism persist. A 2012 report by the U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor also noted a continued global increase in antisemitism, and found that Holocaust denial and opposition to Israeli policy at times was used to promote or justify antisemitism.

In 2025, the Anti-Defamation League released the results of a survey of 58,000 adults from 103 countries taken in 2024, estimating that 2.2 billion people, representing 46% of the world&#x27;s adults, harbor deep antisemitic attitudes.

=== 2023 Israel–Hamas war ===


Amid the 2023 Israel–Hamas War, federal law enforcement in the United States reported a spike in antisemitic harassment, threats and violence. A man was charged for leaving an antisemitic voicemail containing death threats against Senator Jacky Rosen.

In late October, a group of prominent US law firms signed a letter condemning &quot;reports of anti-Semitic harassment, vandalism and assaults on college campuses, including rallies calling for the death of Jews and the elimination of the State of Israel&quot; urging universities to take action.

== Antisemitism in the English-speaking world ==
William D. Rubenstein, a respected author and historian, outlines the presence of antisemitism in the English-speaking world in one of his essays with the same title. In the essay, he explains that there are relatively low levels of antisemitism in the English-speaking world, particularly in Britain and the United States, because of the values associated with Protestantism, the rise of capitalism, and the establishment of constitutional governments that protect civil liberties. Rubenstein does not argue that the treatment of Jews was ideal in these countries, rather he argues that there has been less overt antisemitism in the English-speaking world due to political, ideological, and social structures. Essentially, English-speaking nations experienced lower levels of antisemitism because their liberal and constitutional frameworks limited the organized, violent expression of antisemitism. In his essay, Rubinstein tries to contextualize the reduction of the Jewish population that led to a period of reduced antisemitism: &quot;All Jews were expelled from England in 1290, the first time Jews had been expelled en masse from a European country&quot;.

=== Protestantism ===
As mentioned above, Protestantism was a major factor that curbed antisemitism in England beginning in the sixteenth century. This assertion is supported by the fact that the number of reported instances in which Jews were killed in England was significantly higher prior to the birth of Protestantism albeit this was also affected by the number of resident Jews. Protestants were comparatively more understanding of Jews relative to Catholics and other religious groups. One possible reason as to why Protestant groups were more accepting of Jews was the fact that they preferred the Old Testament rather than the New Testament, so their doctrines shared both content and narrative with Jewish teachings. Rubenstein attests that another reason as to why &quot;most of these [Protestants] were predisposed to be sympathetic to the Jews&quot; was because they often &quot;view[ed] themselves, like the biblical Hebrews, as a chosen group that had entered into a direct covenant with God.&quot; Lastly, Protestantism&#x27;s anti-Catholic bend contributed to lower levels of antisemitism: &quot;All of these groups were profoundly hostile to Catholicism. Anti-Catholicism, at both the elite and mass levels, became a key theme in Britain, tending to push antisemitism aside.&quot; Overall, the emergence of Protestantism lessened the severity of antisemitism through its use of the Old Testament and its anti-Catholic sentiment.

=== Capitalism ===
In post-Napoleonic England, when there was a notable absence of Jews, Britain removed bans on &quot;usury and moneylending,&quot; and Rubenstein attests that London and Liverpool became economic trading hubs which bolstered England&#x27;s status as an economic powerhouse. Jews were often associated with being the moneymakers and financial bodies in continental Europe, so it is significant that the English were able to claim responsibility for the country&#x27;s financial growth and not attribute it to Jews. It is also significant that because Jews were not in the spotlight financially, it took a lot of the anger away from them, and as such, antisemitism was somewhat muted in England. It is said that Jews did not rank among the &quot;economic elite of many British cities&quot; in the 19th century. Again, the significance in this is that British Protestants and non-Jews felt less threatened by Jews because they were not imposing on their prosperity and were not responsible for the economic achievements of their nation. Albert Lindemann also proposes in the introduction to his book &quot;Antisemitism: A History&quot; that Jews &quot;assumed social positions, such as moneylending, that were inherently precarious and tension creating.&quot; Lindemann believes that moneylending is inevitably riddled with tension, so as long as Jews were moneylenders, they would always be at the center of the problem and synonymous with fraught financial affairs.

=== Constitutional government ===
The third major factor which contributed to the lessening of antisemitism in Britain was the establishment of a constitutional government, something that was later adopted and bolstered in the United States. A constitutional government is one which has a written document that outlines the powers of government in an attempt to balance and protect civil rights. After the English Civil War, the Protectorate (1640–60) and the Glorious Revolution (1688), parliament was established to make laws that protected the rights of British citizens. The Bill of Rights specifically outlined laws to protect British civil liberties as well. Thus, it is not surprising that having a constitutional government with liberal principles minimized, to some extent, antisemitism in Britain.

In further attempts to minimize antisemitism within government, the United States&#x27; Declaration of Independence embraced the liberal principles that were previously put forth in England and inspired the formation of a republic that had executive, judicial, and legislative powers and even a law that served to &quot;forbid the establishment of any religion or any official religious test for office holding.&quot; Having a government that respected and protected civil liberties, especially those pertaining to religious liberties, reduced blatant antisemitism by constitutionally protecting the right to practice different faiths. These sentiments go back to the first President of the United States, George Washington, who asserted his belief in religious inclusion. Rubinstein believes that though instances of antisemitism definitely existed in Britain and America, the moderation of antisemitism was limited in English-Speaking countries largely because of political and social ideologies that come with a constitutional government.

=== Other English-speaking countries ===
In addition to being low in the United States and Britain, antisemitism was also low in other English-speaking countries such as Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. Australia has had a historically positive attitude towards Jews and as a result, it had &quot;remarkably little overt antisemitism at any point.&quot; Similarly, Ireland and New Zealand also experienced a lower presence of antisemitism. This is not to say that English-speaking countries have less antisemitic sentiment because their populations speak English, instead, the ideologies that often exist in English-speaking countries affect their acceptance of Jews.

While antisemitism tended to be low in English-speaking regions of Canada, it was higher in Quebec where the native language is French. Quebec has a &quot;long history of blaring antisemitism, enunciated by French-speaking nationalists steeped in the most extreme forms of Catholic hostility towards Jews.&quot; This is important because other English-speaking parts of Canada were more tolerant of Jews than its non-English speaking parts were, which suggests a correlation between lingual diversity and the level of Jewish hate. Additionally, it seems that Quebec&#x27;s firm Catholic hostility towards Jews contributed to local antisemitic behavior.

<text>Ariel is the fourth-largest moon of Uranus. Ariel orbits and rotates in the equatorial plane of Uranus, which is almost perpendicular to the orbit of Uranus, so the moon has an extreme seasonal cycle.

It was discovered on 24 October 1851 by William Lassell and named for a character in two different pieces of literature. As of 2019, much of the detailed knowledge of Ariel derives from a single flyby of Uranus performed by the space probe &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 1986, which managed to image around 35% of the moon&#x27;s surface. There are no active plans at present to return to study the moon in more detail, although various concepts such as a Uranus Orbiter and Probe have been proposed.

After Miranda, Ariel is the second-closest of Uranus&#x27;s five major rounded satellites. Among the smallest of the Solar System&#x27;s 20 known spherical moons (it ranks 14th among them in diameter), it is believed to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material. Its mass is approximately equal in magnitude to Earth&#x27;s hydrosphere.

Like all of Uranus&#x27;s moons, Ariel probably formed from an accretion disc that surrounded the planet shortly after its formation, and, like other large moons, it is likely differentiated, with an inner core of rock surrounded by a mantle of ice. Ariel has a complex surface consisting of extensive cratered terrain cross-cut by a system of scarps, canyons, and ridges. The surface shows signs of more recent geological activity than other Uranian moons, most likely due to tidal heating.

== Discovery and name ==
Discovered on 24 October 1851 by William Lassell, it is named for a sky spirit in Alexander Pope&#x27;s 1712 poem &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

Both Ariel and the slightly larger Uranian satellite Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell on 24 October 1851. Although William Herschel, who discovered Uranus&#x27;s two largest moons Titania and Oberon in 1787, claimed to have observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.

All of Uranus&#x27;s moons are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 at the request of Lassell, though it is uncertain if Herschel devised the names, or if Lassell did so and then sought Herschel&#x27;s permission. Ariel is named after the leading sylph in &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;. It is also the name of the spirit who serves Prospero in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The moon is also designated Uranus I.

== Orbit ==
Among Uranus&#x27;s five major moons, Ariel is the second closest to the planet, orbiting at the distance of about 190,000 km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5 Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that one side of the moon always faces the planet; a condition known as tidal lock. Ariel&#x27;s orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. The trailing hemispheres (those facing away from their directions of orbit) of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon&#x27;s orbit observed by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 1986.

Because Ariel, like Uranus, orbits the Sun almost on its side relative to its rotation, its northern and southern hemispheres face either directly towards or directly away from the Sun at the solstices. This means it is subject to an extreme seasonal cycle; just as Earth&#x27;s poles see permanent night or daylight around the solstices, Ariel&#x27;s poles see permanent night or daylight for half a Uranian year (42 Earth years), with the Sun rising close to the zenith over one of the poles at each solstice. The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby coincided with the 1986 southern summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was dark. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus&#x27;s moons become possible. A number of such events occurred in 2007–2008, including an occultation of Ariel by Umbriel on 19 August 2007.

Currently Ariel is not involved in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in a 5:3 resonance with Miranda, which could have been partially responsible for the heating of that moon (although the maximum heating attributable to a former 1:3 resonance of Umbriel with Miranda was likely about three times greater). Ariel may have once been locked in the 4:1 resonance with Titania, from which it later escaped. Escape from a mean motion resonance is much easier for the moons of Uranus than for those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to Uranus&#x27;s lesser degree of oblateness. This resonance, which was likely encountered about 3.8 billion years ago, would have increased Ariel&#x27;s orbital eccentricity, resulting in tidal friction due to time-varying tidal forces from Uranus. This would have caused warming of the moon&#x27;s interior by as much as 20 K.

== Composition and internal structure ==
Ariel is the fourth-largest of the Uranian moons by size and mass. It is also the 14th-largest moon in the Solar System. The moon&#x27;s density is 1.52 g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice on the surface of the moon, which is porous and thus transmits little solar heat to layers below. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel&#x27;s leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus&#x27;s magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma&#x27;s co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.

Except for water, two other compounds have been identified on the surface of Ariel by infrared spectroscopy. The first is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is concentrated mainly on its trailing hemisphere. Ariel shows the strongest spectroscopic evidence for CO2 of any Uranian satellite, and was the first Uranian satellite on which this compound was discovered. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials under the influence of the energetic charged particles coming from Uranus&#x27;s magnetosphere or solar ultraviolet radiation. This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the outgassing of primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Ariel&#x27;s interior. The escape of CO2 from the interior may be related to past geological activity on this moon. 

The second compound identified by its feature at wavelength of 2.2 μm on Ariel is ammonia, which is distributed more or less homogeneously over the surface. The presence of ammonia may indicate that Ariel was geologically active in recent past.

Given its size, rock/ice composition and the possible presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel&#x27;s interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372 km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon&#x27;s mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon&#x27;s composition. The pressure in the center of Ariel is about 0.3 GPa (3 kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear. The existence of a subsurface ocean is currently considered possible, though a 2006 study suggests that radiogenic heating alone would not be enough to allow for one. More scientific research concluded that an active underwater ocean is possible for the 4 largest moons of Uranus.

== Surface ==
=== Albedo and color ===
Ariel is the most reflective of Uranus&#x27;s moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel&#x27;s surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology on one hand and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.

=== Possible geological activity ===
In February 2025, planetary scientists at Johns Hopkins University published their findings on the possibility that Ariel might be geologically active using images taken by Voyager 2 back in 1986. According to the study, the numerous grooves and grabens running across Ariel&#x27;s surface might be the result of liquid water oozing out from the moon&#x27;s possible subsurface ocean. As the liquid water flows out, it pushes aside the solid icy surface of the moon, splitting apart Ariel&#x27;s surface similar to how lava flowing out of the Earth&#x27;s mantle pushes apart the oceanic crust on Earth&#x27;s mid-Atlantic ridge; but instead of lava, it is liquid water for Ariel. The freshly ejected water then freezes once it reaches the surface, creating a new icy crust and the cycle of splitting apart the crust and generating fresh crust continues. If this study&#x27;s conclusions are correct, then the fresh materials at the center of the grooves and gravens might be exposed samples of what a subsurface ocean might contain, making them attractive places to study and even get samples from to learn more about the nature of subsurface oceans. The study suggests that the grooves are good sources of carbon oxides samples.

=== Surface features ===
The observed surface of Ariel can be divided into three terrain types: cratered terrain, ridged terrain, and plains. The main surface features are impact craters, canyons, fault scarps, ridges, and troughs.

The cratered terrain, a rolling surface covered by numerous impact craters and centered on Ariel&#x27;s south pole, is the moon&#x27;s oldest and most geographically extensive geological unit. It is intersected by a network of scarps, canyons (graben), and narrow ridges mainly occurring in Ariel&#x27;s mid-southern latitudes. The canyons, known as &quot;chasmata&quot;, probably represent graben formed by extensional faulting, which resulted from global tensional stresses caused by the freezing of water (or aqueous ammonia) in the moon&#x27;s interior (see below). They are 15–50 km wide and trend mainly in an east- or northeasterly direction. The floors of many canyons are convex; rising up by 1–2 km. Sometimes the floors are separated from the walls of canyons by grooves (troughs) about 1 km wide. The widest graben have grooves running along the crests of their convex floors, which are called &quot;valles&quot;. The longest canyon is Kachina Chasma, at over 620 km in length (the feature extends into the hemisphere of Ariel that &quot;Voyager 2&quot; did not see illuminated).

The second main terrain type—ridged terrain—comprises bands of ridges and troughs hundreds of kilometers in extent. It bounds the cratered terrain and cuts it into polygons. Within each band, which can be up to 25 to 70 km wide, are individual ridges and troughs up to 200 km long and between 10 and 35 km apart. The bands of ridged terrain often form continuations of canyons, suggesting that they may be a modified form of the graben or the result of a different reaction of the crust to the same extensional stresses, such as brittle failure.

The youngest terrain observed on Ariel are the plains: relatively low-lying smooth areas that must have formed over a long period of time, judging by their varying levels of cratering. The plains are found on the floors of canyons and in a few irregular depressions in the middle of the cratered terrain. In the latter case they are separated from the cratered terrain by sharp boundaries, which in some cases have a lobate pattern. The most likely origin for the plains is through volcanic processes; their linear vent geometry, resembling terrestrial shield volcanoes, and distinct topographic margins suggest that the erupted liquid was very viscous, possibly a supercooled water/ammonia solution, with solid ice volcanism also a possibility. The thickness of these hypothetical cryolava flows is estimated at 1–3 km. The canyons must therefore have formed at a time when endogenic resurfacing was still taking place on Ariel. A few of these areas appear to be less than 100 million years old, suggesting that Ariel may still be geologically active in spite of its relatively small size and lack of current tidal heating.

Ariel appears to be fairly evenly cratered compared to other moons of Uranus; the relative paucity of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System&#x27;s formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel&#x27;s past geologic activity is believed to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78 km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100 km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. If this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245 km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.

== Origin and evolution ==
Ariel is thought to have formed from an accretion disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.

The accretion process probably lasted for several thousand years before the moon was fully formed. Models suggest that impacts accompanying accretion caused heating of Ariel&#x27;s outer layer, reaching a maximum temperature of around 195 K at a depth of about 31 km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Ariel heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon&#x27;s crust reaching estimates of 30 MPa, which may have led to cracking. Some present-day scarps and canyons may be a result of this process, which lasted for about 200 million years.

The initial accretional heating together with continued decay of radioactive elements and likely tidal heating may have led to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176 K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago. The freezing of the water likely led to the expansion of the interior, which may have been responsible for the formation of the canyons and obliteration of the ancient surface. The liquids from the ocean may have been able to erupt to the surface, flooding floors of canyons in the process known as cryovolcanism. More recent analysis concluded that an active ocean is probable for the 4 largest moons of Uranus; specifically including Ariel.

Thermal modeling of Saturn&#x27;s moon Dione, which is similar to Ariel in size, density, and surface temperature, suggests that solid state convection could have lasted in Ariel&#x27;s interior for billions of years, and that temperatures in excess of 173 K (the melting point of aqueous ammonia) may have persisted near its surface for several hundred million years after formation, and near a billion years closer to the core.

== Observation and exploration ==

The apparent magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; similar to that of Pluto near perihelion. However, while Pluto can be seen through a telescope of 30 cm aperture, Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus&#x27;s glare, is often not visible to telescopes of 40 cm aperture.

The only close-up images of Ariel were obtained by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. The closest approach of &quot;Voyager 2&quot; to Ariel was —significantly less than the distances to all other Uranian moons except Miranda. The best images of Ariel have a spatial resolution of about 2 km. They cover about 40% of the surface, but only 35% was photographed with the quality required for geological mapping and crater counting. At the time of the flyby, the southern hemisphere of Ariel (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied. No other spacecraft has ever visited the Uranian system. The possibility of sending the Cassini spacecraft to Uranus was evaluated during its mission extension planning phase. It would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn, and these plans were scrapped in favour of remaining at Saturn and eventually destroying the spacecraft in Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere.

=== Transits ===
On 26 July 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope captured a rare transit made by Ariel on Uranus, which cast a shadow that could be seen on the Uranian cloud tops. Such events are rare and only occur around equinoxes, as the moon&#x27;s orbital plane about Uranus is tilted 98° to Uranus&#x27;s orbital plane about the Sun. Another transit, in 2008, was recorded by the European Southern Observatory.

<text>Caesar ( English  Caesars; Latin  ; in Greek: ) is a title of imperial character. It derives from the &quot;cognomen&quot; of the Roman dictator Julius Caesar. The change from being a surname to a title used by the Roman emperors can be traced to AD 68, following the fall of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. When used on its own, the title denoted heirs apparent, who would later adopt the title &quot;Augustus&quot; on accession. The title remained an essential part of the style of the emperors, and became the word for &quot;emperor&quot; in some languages, such as German () and Slavic ().

==Origins==
The first known individual to bear the &quot;cognomen&quot; of &quot;Caesar&quot; was Sextus Julius Caesar, who is likewise believed to be the common ancestor of all subsequent Julii Caesares. Sextus&#x27;s great-grandson was the dictator Gaius Julius Caesar, who seized control of the Roman Republic following his war against the Senate. He appointed himself as (&quot;dictator in perpetuity&quot;), a title he held for only about a month before he was assassinated in 44 BC. Julius Caesar&#x27;s death did not lead to the restoration of the Republic, and instead led to the rise of the Second Triumvirate, which was made up of three generals, including Julius&#x27; adopted son Gaius Octavius.

Following Roman naming conventions, Octavius adopted the name of his adoptive father, thus also becoming &quot;Gaius Julius Caesar&quot;, though he was often called &quot;Octavianus&quot; to avoid confusion. He styled himself simply as &quot;Gaius Caesar&quot; to emphasize his relationship with Julius Caesar. Eventually, distrust and jealousy between the triumvirs led to a lengthy civil war which ultimately ended with Octavius gaining control of the entire Roman world in 30 BC. In 27 BC, Octavius was given the honorific &quot;Augustus&quot; by the Senate, adopting the name of &quot;Imperator Caesar Augustus&quot;. He had previously dropped all his names except for &quot;Caesar&quot;, which he treated as a &quot;nomen&quot;, and had adopted the victory title &quot;imperator&quot; (&quot;commander&quot;) as a new &quot;praenomen&quot;.

As a matter of course, Augustus&#x27;s own adopted son and successor, Tiberius, followed his (step)father&#x27;s example and bore the name &quot;Caesar&quot; following his adoption on 26 June 4 AD, restyling himself as &quot;Tiberius Julius Caesar&quot;. Upon his own ascension to the throne, he styled himself as &quot;Tiberius Caesar Augustus&quot;. The precedent was thus then set: the Emperor, styled as &quot;Augustus&quot;, designated his successor by adopting him and giving him the name &quot;Caesar&quot;.

The fourth emperor, Claudius (in full, &quot;Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus&quot;), was the first to assume the name without having been adopted by the previous emperor. However, he was at least a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, being the maternal great-nephew of Augustus on his mother&#x27;s side, the nephew of Tiberius, and the uncle of Caligula (who was also called &quot;Gaius Julius Caesar&quot;). Claudius, in turn, adopted his stepson and grand-nephew Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, giving him the name &quot;Caesar&quot; in addition to his own &quot;nomen&quot;, &quot;Claudius&quot;. His stepson thus became &quot;Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus&quot;.

== Dynastic title ==
The first emperor to assume both the position and name without any real claim was Galba, who took the throne under the name &quot;Servius Galba Caesar Augustus&quot; following the death of Nero in AD 68. Galba helped solidify &quot;Caesar&quot; as the title of the designated heir by giving it to his own adopted heir, Piso Licinianus. His reign did not last long, however, and he was soon killed by Otho, who became &quot;Marcus Otho Caesar Augustus&quot;. Otho was then defeated by Vitellius, who became &quot;Aulus Vitellius Germanicus Augustus&quot;, adopting the victory title &quot;Germanicus&quot; instead. Nevertheless, &quot;Caesar&quot; had become such an integral part of the imperial dignity that its place was immediately restored by Vespasian, who ended the civil war and established the Flavian dynasty in AD 69, ruling as &quot;Imperator Caesar Vespasianus Augustus&quot;. 

The placement of the name &quot;Caesar&quot; varied among the early emperors. It usually came right before the &quot;cognomen&quot; (Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, Trajan, Hadrian); a few placed it right after it (Galba, Otho, Nerva). The imperial formula was finally standardised during the reign of Antoninus Pius. Antoninus, born &quot;Titus Aurelius Antoninus&quot;, became &quot;Titus Aelius Caesar Antoninus&quot; after his adoption but ruled as &quot;Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius&quot;. The imperial formula thus became &quot;&quot;Imperator Caesar&quot; [name] &quot;Augustus&quot;&quot; for emperors. Heir-apparents added &quot;Caesar&quot; to their names, placing it after their &quot;cognomen&quot;. Caesars occasionally were given the honorific &quot;princeps iuventutis&quot; (&quot;First among the Youth&quot;) and, starting with the 3rd century, &quot;nobilissimus&quot; (&quot;Most Noble&quot;).

==Later developments==
===Crisis of the Third Century===
The popularity of using the title &quot;caesar&quot; to designate heirs-apparent increased throughout the third century. Many of the soldier-emperors during the Crisis of the Third Century attempted to strengthen their legitimacy by naming their sons as heirs with the title of &quot;caesar&quot;, namely Maximinus Thrax, Philip the Arab, Decius, Trebonianus Gallus, Gallienus and Carus. With the exception of Verus Maximus and Valerian II all of them were later either promoted to the rank of &quot;augustus&quot; within their father&#x27;s lifetime (like Philip II) or succeeded as &quot;augusti&quot; after their father&#x27;s death (Hostilian and Numerian). The same title would also be used in the Gallic Empire, which operated autonomously from the rest of the Roman Empire from 260 to 274, with the final Gallic emperor Tetricus I appointing his heir Tetricus II as &quot;caesar&quot; and his consular colleague. 

Despite the best efforts of these emperors, however, the granting of this title does not seem to have made succession in this chaotic period any more stable. Almost all &quot;caesares&quot; would be killed before, or alongside, their fathers, or, at best, outlive them for a matter of months, as in the case of Hostilian. The sole &quot;caesar&quot; to successfully obtain the rank of &quot;augustus&quot; and rule for some time in his own right was Gordian III, and even he was heavily controlled by his court.

===Tetrarchy and Diarchy===
In 293, Diocletian established the Tetrarchy, a system of rule by two senior emperors and two junior colleagues. The two coequal senior emperors were styled identically to previous Emperors, as &quot;augustus&quot; (in plural, &quot;augusti&quot;). The two junior colleagues were styled identically to previous Emperors-designate, as &quot;nobilissimus caesar&quot;. Likewise, the junior colleagues retained the title &quot;caesar&quot; upon becoming full emperors. The &quot;caesares&quot; of this period are sometimes referred as &quot;emperors&quot;, with the Tetrarchy being a &quot;rule of four emperors&quot;, despite being clearly subordinate of the &quot;augusti&quot; and thus not actually sovereigns.

The Tetrarchy collapsed as soon as Diocletian stepped down in 305, resulting in a lengthy civil war. Constantine reunited the Empire in 324, after defeating the Eastern emperor Licinius. The tetrarchic division of power was abandoned, although the divisions of the praetorian prefectures were maintained. The title &quot;caesar&quot; continued to be used, but now merely as a ceremorial honorific for young heirs. Constantine had four &quot;caesares&quot; at the time of his death: his sons Constantius II, Constantine II, Constans and his nephew Dalmatius, with his eldest son Crispus having been executed in mysterious circumstances earlier in his reign. He would be succeeded only by his three sons, with Dalmatius dying in the summer of 337 in similarly murky circumstances. Constantius II himself would nominate as &quot;caesares&quot; his cousins Constantius Gallus and Julian in succession in the 350s, although he first executed Gallus and then found himself at war with Julian before his own death. After Julian&#x27;s revolt of 360, the title fell out of imperial fashion for some time, with emperors preferring simply to elevate their sons directly to &quot;augustus&quot;, starting with Gratian in 367.

The title would be revived in 408 when Constantine III gave it to his son Constans II, and then in 424 when Theodosius II gave it to his nephew Valentinian III before successfully installing him upon the western throne as &quot;augustus&quot; in 425. Thereafter it would receive limited use in the Eastern Empire; for example, it was given to Leo II in 472 several months before his grandfather&#x27;s death. In the Western Empire, Palladius, the son of emperor Petronius Maximus, became the last person bearing the title &quot;caesar&quot; in 455.

=== Byzantine Empire ===

&quot;Caesar&quot; or &quot;Kaisar&quot; () remained a senior court title in the Eastern or Byzantine Empire. Originally, as in the classical Roman Empire, it was used for the heir apparent, and was first among the &quot;awarded&quot; dignities. From the reign of Theodosius I, however, most emperors chose to solidify the succession of their intended heirs by raising them to co-emperors, i.e. &quot;augustus&quot;. Hence the title was more frequently awarded to second- and third-born sons, or to close and influential relatives of the Emperor: for example, Alexios Mosele who was the son-in-law of Theophilos (ruled 829–842), Bardas who was the uncle and chief minister of Michael III (r. 842–867), and Nikephoros II (r. 963–969) who awarded the title to his father, Bardas Phokas. An exceptional case was the conferment of the dignity and its insignia to the Bulgarian khan Tervel by Justinian II (r. 685–695, 705–711) who had helped him regain his throne in 705. The title was awarded to the brother of Empress Maria of Alania, George II of Georgia in 1081.

The office enjoyed extensive privileges, great prestige and power. When Alexios I Komnenos created the title of &quot;sebastokrator&quot;, &quot;kaisar&quot; became third in importance, and fourth after Manuel I Komnenos created the title of &quot;despot&quot;, which it remained until the end of the Empire. The feminine form was &quot;kaisarissa&quot;. It remained an office of great importance, usually awarded to imperial relations, as well as a few high-ranking and distinguished officials, and only rarely awarded to foreigners.

According to the &quot;Klētorologion&quot; of 899, the Byzantine &quot;caesar&quot;″s insignia were a crown without a cross, and the ceremony of a &quot;caesar&quot;″s creation (in this case dating to Constantine V), is included in &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot; I.43. The title remained the highest in the imperial hierarchy until the introduction of the &quot;sebastokratōr&quot; (a composite derived from &quot;sebastos&quot; and &quot;autokrator&quot;, the Greek equivalents of &quot;augustus&quot; and &quot;imperator&quot;) by Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) and later of &quot;despotēs&quot; by Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180). The title remained in existence through the last centuries of the Empire. In the Palaiologan period, it was held by prominent nobles such as Alexios Strategopoulos, but from the 14th century, it was mostly awarded to rulers of the Balkans such as the princes of Vlachia, Serbia and Thessaly.
In the late Byzantine hierarchy, as recorded in the mid-14th century &quot;Book of Offices&quot; of pseudo-Kodinos, the rank continued to come after the &quot;sebastokratōr&quot;. Pseudo-Kodinos further records that the &quot;caesar&quot; was equal in precedence to the &quot;panhypersebastos&quot;, another creation of Alexios I, but that Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) had raised his nephew Michael Tarchaneiotes to the rank of &quot;protovestiarios&quot; and decreed that to come after the &quot;caesar&quot;; while under Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) the &quot;megas domestikos&quot; was raised to the same eminence, when it was awarded to the future emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347–1354). According to pseudo-Kodinos, the &quot;caesar&quot;″s insignia under the Palaiologoi was a &quot;skiadion&quot; hat in red and gold, decorated with gold-wire embroideries, with a veil bearing the wearer&#x27;s name and pendants identical to those of the &quot;despotēs&quot; and the &quot;sebastokratōr&quot;. He wore a red tunic (&quot;rouchon&quot;) similar to the emperor&#x27;s (without certain decorations), and his shoes and stockings were blue, as were the accouterments of his horse; these were all identical to those of the &quot;sebastokratōr&quot;, but without the embroidered eagles of the latter. Pseudo-Kodinos writes that the particular forms of another form of hat, the domed &quot;skaranikon&quot;, and of the mantle, the &quot;tamparion&quot;, for the &quot;caesar&quot; were not known.

===Ottoman Empire===
&quot;Caesar&quot; is the title officially used by the Sasanid Persians to refer to the Roman and Byzantine emperors. In the Middle East, the Persians and the Arabs continued to refer to the Roman and Byzantine emperors as &quot;Caesar&quot; (in &quot;Qaysar-i Rum&quot;, &quot;Caesar of the Romans&quot;, from Middle Persian &quot;kēsar&quot;). Thus, following the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the victorious Ottoman sultan Mehmed II became the first of the rulers of the Ottoman Empire to assume the title (in &quot;Kayser-i Rûm&quot;). 

After the Fall of Constantinople, having conquered the Byzantine Empire, Mehmed took the title &quot;Kayser-i Rûm&quot;, claiming succession to the Roman imperium. His claim was that, by possession of the city, he was emperor, a new dynast by conquest, as had been done previously by the likes of Heraclius and Leo III. Contemporary scholar George of Trebizond wrote &quot;the seat of the Roman Empire is Constantinople ... and he who is and remains Emperor of the Romans is also the Emperor of the whole world&quot;. 

Gennadius II, a staunch antagonist of the West because of the Sack of Constantinople committed by the Western Catholics and theological controversies between the two Churches, had been enthroned the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople-New Rome with all the ceremonial elements and ethnarch (or &quot;milletbashi&quot;) status by the Sultan himself in 1454. In turn, Gennadius II formally recognized Mehmed as successor to the throne. Mehmed also had a blood lineage to the Byzantine Imperial family; his predecessor, Sultan Orhan had married a Byzantine princess, and Mehmed may have claimed descent from John Tzelepes Komnenos. Ottoman sultans were not the only rulers to claim such a title, as there was the Holy Roman Empire in Western Europe, whose emperor, Frederick III, traced his titular lineage from Charlemagne who obtained the title of Roman Emperor when he was crowned by Pope Leo III in 800, although he was never recognized as such by the Byzantine Empire. 

In diplomatic writings between the Ottomans and Austrians, the Ottoman bureaucracy was angered by their use of the Caesar title when the Ottomans saw themself as the true successors of Rome. When war broke out and peace negotiations were done, the Austrians (Holy Roman Empire) agreed to give up the use of the Caesar title according to Treaty of Constantinople (1533) (though they would continue to use it and the Roman imperial title until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806). The Russians, who defined Moscow as the Third Rome, were similarly sanctioned by the Ottomans, who ordered the Crimean Khanate to raid Russia on numerous occasions. The Ottomans stopped claiming political superiority over the Holy Roman Empire with the Treaty of Zsitvatorok in 1606, and over the Russian Empire with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774, by diplomatically recognising the monarchs of these two countries as equals to the Ottoman Sultan for the first time.

<text>Francysk Skaryna (alternative transcriptions of his name: &quot;Francišak Skaryna&quot; or &quot;Francisk Skaryna&quot;; , ; , ; 1470 – 1551/29 January 1552) was a Belarusian humanist, physician, and translator. He is known to be one of the first book printers in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and in all of Eastern Europe, laying the groundwork for the development of the of the Church Slavonic language.

== Early life and education ==
Skaryna was born into a wealthy family from Polotsk, which was then a major trade and manufacturing center of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His father, Luka Skaryna, was a merchant, who dealt with someone known as Doronya Ivanov, from Velikiye Luki. Skaryna&#x27;s older brother, Ivan, was also a merchant. The brothers owned property, possibly ancestral, in Polotsk.

Research indicates that Skaryna was born in 1470. The year 1490 is often proposed based on the assumption that he was 14 when he came to study in Kraków in 1504. The date is an upper boundary; while new students younger than 14 were rare, older ones were not unusual, and Skaryna could have started his studies at the age of 18 or even older. suggested that the overlapping sun and moon on Skaryna&#x27;s personal emblem indicates that he was born around the time of the 1486 solar eclipse, which was observed in Polotsk.

It is believed that he received his primary education in Polotsk and possibly in Vilnius. In 1504, Skaryna is recorded as a student at Jagiellonian University. In 1506, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1512, after passing all required tests, he received a doctorate in medicine at the University of Padua in Italy. Records suggest that he requested to take his examination in Padua but had not studied in the city. Earlier, he obtained an &quot;artium doctor&quot; degree, but the exact date and place are unknown.

== Later life ==
Skaryna arrived in Prague by 1517. According to one hypothesis, he had been a student at Charles University in Prague, but there is no documentary evidence of this. In the same year, he rented a printing house from a merchant named Severin in Prague and started publishing a new translation of the Bible with his own prefaces.

On 6 August 1517, his first edition, , was released. &quot;The Psalter&quot; comprises nearly all of the biblical books of Holy Scripture. He released new books periodically over the next few months (10 September, 6 October, 5 December, 2 January 1518, 9 January, and 19 January). Then, on 10 August 1518, he published four books at the same time. The culmination of his life&#x27;s work was printing a translation of the Bible in twenty-three books from 1517 to 1519.

In 1522, Skaryna opened the first printing house in Vilnius. He published &quot;&quot;, followed by &quot;Apostol&quot; in 1525. &quot;Apostol&quot; was released in the same order as it is used in Orthodox worship now.

In the late 1520s or early 1530s, he visited Moscow. He wished to distribute his books in Moscow but was unsuccessful.

Skaryna married Margarita, the widow of a Vilnius city councilor. In 1529, following his brother&#x27;s death, he went to Poznań and obtained a share of Ivan&#x27;s property. In 1530, he moved with his wife to Königsberg, but they soon returned to Vilnius.

In 1532, he worked as a doctor and secretary to John, Bishop of Vilnius. After two years, creditors of his late brother Ivan considered Skaryna as the brother&#x27;s primary heir, and imprisoned him in Poznań. He was there for several months. Roman Skaryna, Ivan&#x27;s son and Francysk&#x27;s nephew, actively helped his uncle, meeting with King Sigismund I. When Skaryna was released, he sent a complaint letter with a counterclaim against the creditors to the King. In response to the letter, he was awarded two royal privilege certificates (dated 21 and 25 November 1532). These certificates exempted him from the jurisdiction of all authorities except the King.

The last information about Skaryna is mentioned in the archives of 1534. He moved from Vilnius to Prague. He probably served in the royal garden in Prague until his death. According to some theories, Skaryna taught as a professor at Charles University in Prague. He is presumed to have died sometime between 1551 and January 29, 1552.

In 1552, his son Simeon Rus Skaryna received a royal certificate, according to which he, as the sole heir, was given all of the property of his father. The property included manuscripts, letters, and books.

== Religion ==

It is not known for certain whether Skaryna was Catholic or Orthodox. His name is Catholic, but it is often suggested that he changed it before entering the university. A single copy of a document in which he is called &quot;Georgius Franciscus&quot; instead of just &quot;Franciscus&quot; gave birth to a theory that &quot;Georgius&quot; was his original name; today, however, it is mostly accepted to be a scribe&#x27;s error (the presumed correct reading being &quot;egregius Franciscus&quot;, &quot;venerable Francysk&quot;). In any case, the once popular theory that he changed his name from &quot;Georgius&quot; to &quot;Franciscus&quot; to be able to enter the university is unsupported by evidence: the name &quot;Georgius&quot; was equally popular among the Catholic and the Orthodox in the region, and in Skaryna&#x27;s year there were more students named &quot;Georgius&quot; than &quot;Franciscus&quot; in Kraków.

In 1552, after Skaryna&#x27;s death (and long after his final departure from the country) King Sigismund August mentioned in a letter that a man from his country printed a translation of the Bible and tried to sell his edition in Moscow, but the books had been burned there because they had been produced &quot;by a subject of the Roman Church&quot;. The books mentioned in the letter are most probably Skaryna&#x27;s.

== Publishing activities ==
Skaryna devoted his life to the publication of the biblical texts. He sought to make the Bible more available to the common people and write it in an accessible language. Skaryna also composed prefaces to his editions, in which he emphasized that the purpose of his publishing activities was to help ordinary people &quot;become acquainted with wisdom and science&quot;. He contributed to the development of the Belarusian literary language. This Bible became the second printed Bible in the Slavic world, following the publication of a Czech edition.

=== Books ===

In 1517, Skaryna started his publishing career in Prague. He printed his Psalter, and then twenty-two books of the Old Testament under the shared name &quot;Biblia Ruska&quot;. His books were different from the Western European printed Bibles of that time, in that they were all published in the quarto format. Skaryna&#x27;s editions of the Bible were printed in the Church Slavonic language with many Ruthenian words. Belarusian linguists can also identify the influence of the Polish and Czech languages.

Skaryna&#x27;s books contributed to the development of the of the Church Slavonic language.

Skaryna&#x27;s Bible challenged the existing rules of that time. It contains text from the publisher, his comments, forewords, and afterwords. In addition, it contains prints with his image. It is the only such case in the history of the publication of Bibles in Eastern Europe.

All of Skaryna&#x27;s editions are very rare today, especially those published in Vilnius. Copies are stored in libraries in Minsk, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kyiv, Vilnius, Lviv, London, Prague, Copenhagen, and Kraków.

== Legacy ==

The language in which Francysk Skaryna printed his books was based on Church Slavonic, but with a large number of Belarusian words, and therefore was most understandable to the inhabitants of the Ruthenian lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (the territory of modern Belarus). Skaryna was one of the pioneers of publishing in Cyrillic script, but not the first: the &quot;Oktoikh&quot; was published by Schweipolt Fiol in 1491. While he used an Eastern Slavic language, it is difficult to determine precisely what language he used, since there was no standard Belarusian language at that time. Some researchers maintain that Skaryna&#x27;s books were in Church Slavonic heavily saturated with Ruthenian.

Some Belarusian scholars see Skaryna as a Renaissance man, on par with Copernicus and Erasmus, whose work in the Slavic lands was a part of the European Reformation.

At different times five streets in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, were named after Francysk Skaryna; only one left on the map: the Old Barysau Way (&quot;Starabarysauski trakt&quot;) was renamed to (&quot;vulica Skaryny&quot;) in 2005. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Leninsky Avenue, the main avenue of Minsk was renamed to the Skaryna Avenue. However, in 2005, under the rule of Alexander Lukashenko, it was renamed to the Independence Avenue. Streets are named after Francysk Skaryna in many other cities of Belarus, including Polatsk, Vitebsk, Nesvizh, Orsha, Slutsk.

Two awards are given in Belarus in honor of Skaryna: the Medal of Francysk Skaryna, and the Order of Francysk Skaryna. There are monuments to Francysk Skaryna in Polotsk, Minsk, Lida, Vilnius, Chisinau, and Prague.

Several cultural organizations are named for Skaryna, particularly the Frantsishak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society in Belarus, and the Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum in London. Homyel State University is named for Skaryna.

In 1969, Boris Stepanov filmed a movie (&quot;I, Francysk Skaryna&quot;) .

In 1991, Skaryna was depicted on the Soviet Union one-ruble coin.

<text>Argosy was an American magazine, founded in 1882 as The Golden Argosy, a children&#x27;s weekly, edited by Frank Munsey and published by E. G. Rideout. Munsey took over as publisher when Rideout went bankrupt in 1883, and after many struggles made the magazine profitable. He shortened the title to The Argosy in 1888 and targeted an audience of men and boys with adventure stories. In 1894 he switched it to a monthly schedule and in 1896 he eliminated all non-fiction and started using cheap pulp paper, making it the first pulp magazine. Circulation had reached half a million by 1907, and remained strong until the 1930s. The name was changed to Argosy All-Story Weekly in 1920 after the magazine merged with &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;, another Munsey pulp, and from 1929 it became just &quot;Argosy&quot;.

In 1925 Munsey died, and the publisher, the Frank A. Munsey Company, was purchased by William Dewart, who had worked for Munsey. By 1942 circulation had fallen to no more than 50,000, and after a failed effort to revive the magazine by including sensational non-fiction, it was sold that year to Popular Publications, another pulp magazine publisher. Popular converted it from pulp to slick format, and initially attempted to make it a fiction-only magazine, but gave up on this within a year. Instead it became a men&#x27;s magazine, carrying fiction and feature articles aimed at men. Circulation soared and by the early 1950s was well over one million.

Early contributors included Horatio Alger, Oliver Optic, and G. A. Henty. During the pulp era, many famous writers appeared in &quot;Argosy&quot;, including O. Henry, James Branch Cabell, Albert Payson Terhune, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Erle Stanley Gardner, Zane Grey, Robert E. Howard, and Max Brand. &quot;Argosy&quot; was regarded as one of the most prestigious publications in the pulp market, along with &quot;Blue Book&quot;, &quot;Adventure&quot; and &quot;Short Stories&quot;. After the transition to slick format it continued to publish fiction, including science fiction by Robert Heinlein, Arthur Clarke, and Ray Bradbury. From 1948 to 1958 it published a series by Gardner called &quot;The Court of Last Resort&quot; which examined the cases of dozens of convicts who maintained their innocence, and succeeding in overturning many of the convictions. NBC adapted the series for television in 1957.

Popular sold &quot;Argosy&quot; to David Geller in 1972, and in 1978 Geller sold it to the Filipacchi Group, which closed it at the end of the year. The magazine has been revived several times, most recently in 2016.

==Publication history==

=== &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot; ===
In the late 1870s, Frank Munsey was working in Augusta, Maine, as the manager of the local Western Union office. He helped a friend get a job at a publisher in Augusta, and after a couple of years his friend moved to New York City to work for another publishing company. Munsey was becoming more familiar with the publishing industry during this time, and decided he wanted to launch a magazine of his own. He had some difficulty in getting anyone to agree to invest, but eventually persuaded a stockbroker he knew to put in $2,500 ($ in ), of which $500 was a loan to Munsey. Munsey invested $500 of his own, and his friend in New York City added another $1,000, making a total of $4,000 ($ in ) in capital. Munsey resigned from Western Union, and moved to New York on September 23, 1882, bringing with him manuscripts he had bought for the magazine before leaving Augusta.

Once in New York, Munsey quickly realized that the cost estimates he had made, based on what he had been able to learn while in Maine, were unrealistically low. His original plan for the magazine had been to make it a close copy of &quot;Golden Days&quot;, a weekly paper for children published in Philadelphia by James Elverson, and to include lithographed covers and internal illustrations. He abandoned these ideas and came up with a simplified approach, still based on &quot;Golden Days&quot;, that he believed could be made profitable. He wrote to the stockbroker who had promised $2,500 to get the funds sent to him, but received no reply, and since this made it impossible to start the magazine as planned, Munsey released his New York friend from his promise of investment. This left Munsey with only about $40 ($ in ), along with the manuscripts he had in hand, which had cost over $500 to acquire. He began looking for a publisher who would back the new magazine, and eventually persuaded E. G. Rideout to take it on. The first issue, titled &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot;, with Munsey as editor and manager, was dated December 9, 1882; it was eight pages long and cost five cents ($ in ). Subscribers were offered a set of colored chromolithographs along with their subscription.

Five months later Rideout went bankrupt. Munsey had not drawn all his salary, and Rideout had borrowed money from him as well, so he was owed about $1,000 ($ in ) by the bankrupt company. He claimed the magazine&#x27;s title and subscription list in return for his debt, succeeding over a competing claim from a publisher who would have merged the magazine&#x27;s subscriptions into those of his own publication. The first issue with Munsey as publisher was dated September 8, 1883. Munsey again was reduced to a few dollars, but he was able to borrow $300 ($ in ) from Oscar Holway, a banker in Augusta who was a friend. At about this time he bought some stories from Malcolm Douglas, but when Douglas came to collect his payment Munsey offered him the job of editor, at $10 ($ in ) per week, in lieu of payment for the stories. Douglas accepted.
A friend from Augusta, John Fogler, who had become cashier of Augusta&#x27;s First National Bank, was able to arrange another loan for Munsey, of $1,000. Munsey managed to maintain the regular weekly schedule but the financial pressure on him was enormous. Rideout had set up Munsey in an office on Barclay Street in what is now known as Tribeca, in Manhattan; Munsey moved to an office on Warren Street nearby to reduce the rent, and he and Douglas would eat in a German beer saloon where they could get a free lunch. Munsey and Douglas assembled free material by rewriting items from English boys&#x27; papers. One week, Douglas was unable to find enough material to fill an issue. Munsey wrote a short story that night: &quot;Harry&#x27;s Scheme, or Camping Among the Maples&quot;, about two boys in the Maine woods, and turned it in to Douglas the next morning. Douglas twice saw Munsey write a letter to Elverson, offering the subscription list of &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot; in return for a job at $50 per week, but Munsey did not mail either letter.

In 1884 James Blaine was the Republican candidate for President. Blaine knew of Munsey from Augusta, and his campaign needed help with publicity: Munsey proposed a new magazine, &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Illustrated Weekly&quot;, to carry campaign news. It only lasted two months, from September 6 to November 8, 1884, but it helped Munsey by giving him an official-seeming presence in publishing that made it much easier for him to obtain credit for paper and other supplies. Before the campaign he had been unable to get credit; after it he was $8,000 ($ in ) in debt to his suppliers. Ten years later Munsey recalled the change, and said &quot;That debt made me. Before, I had no credit and had to live from hand to mouth. But when I owed $8,000 my creditors didn&#x27;t dare drop me. They saw their only chance of getting anything was to keep me going.&quot; Munsey had a bank account in New York, but kept two more, in Maine and Chicago, moving funds between them constantly: &quot;I kept thousands of dollars in the air between these three banks. It was a dizzy, dazzling, daring game, a game to live for, to die for, a royal glorious game&quot;. Munsey told a story of being unable to meet payroll because the New York bank would not give him credit. He went to the bank, upbraided the president for his &quot;effrontery&quot;, and left without letting the man speak. When his employee went to the bank again that day, he was able to cash the payroll check.

The fact that &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot; never missed an issue also helped Munsey persuade the businesses he worked with to extend him credit, which in turn helped him invest in the business. In the winter of 1885/1886 he wrote a serial, &quot;Afloat in a Great City&quot;, with the intention of using it as the basis for an advertising campaign to increase subscriptions. Munsey owed $5,000 at this point, and went into debt by about another $10,000 to advertise the story, distributing 100,000 sample copies of the March 13, 1886 issue containing the first installment of the serial in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the surrounding areas. The campaign was a success, and from being a more-or-less breakeven concern, &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot; began to net Munsey about $100 a week in profit, not counting the cost of the campaign. This convinced Munsey to invest further in building circulation. A new editor, Matthew White, took over from Douglas at the end of the year; White had been the founder and editor of &quot;The Boys&#x27; World&quot;, which Munsey bought in 1887, merging the subscriptions with &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot;. At the same time Munsey doubled the page count and increased the price from five cents to six. In 1887 he began a national advertising campaign, with traveling representatives as far west as Nebraska, and a mail campaign for points further west. He wrote another story, &quot;The Boy Broker&quot;, for serialization, beginning in the February 5, 1887 issue, and credited it with adding 20,000 to &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot;&#x27;s circulation. Over five months the campaign gave away 11,500,000 sample issues: his debt ballooned to $95,000 ($ in ), but he was now clearing $1,500 ($ in ) a week in profit, and circulation reached 115,000 in May 1887.

=== &quot;The Argosy&quot; ===

The improvement in Munsey&#x27;s finances in 1887 was temporary, though before Munsey realized it he had given up his cheap rooms and moved to the Windsor Hotel on Fifth Avenue. Another advertising campaign was launched; it cost $20,000 ($ in ) but produced no results, and Munsey began to experiment with the magazine, trying to find a profitable approach. He shortened the title to just &quot;The Argosy&quot; with the December 1, 1888 issue to make it sound more like an adventure magazine and less like a children&#x27;s paper. He later commented that he had not realized the problems attendant on magazines for children—they grew up quickly and dropped their subscriptions, so circulation was very difficult to maintain, and because they had little spending power it was hard to interest advertisers. He reduced the page size and increased the page count, and added illustrated covers, and cut the price, and then reversed all these changes, but nothing worked. In 1890 circulation dropped to the point where it no longer covered its own costs. The expenses Munsey had taken on after the successful campaign in 1887 were now a drain, and when his friend Fogler visited, and was impressed that Munsey was living at the Windsor, he told Fogler, &quot;I can&#x27;t afford it ... but it is a means to an end. It gives me standing to have the acquaintance of the men I meet here.&quot; Fogler also discovered on that visit that Munsey had a personal pew in a popular church, which cost him $1,000 ($ in ) a year.

Munsey launched two more periodicals, hoping that they would establish themselves as profitable before &quot;The Argosy&quot; failed completely. The first was &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, launched on February 2, 1889; the second was a newspaper, the &quot;Daily&quot; &quot;Continent&quot;, which he took over in February 1891 and gave up on four months later. The &quot;Weekly&quot; was not a success either, and in late 1891 Munsey converted it into a monthly, &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, priced at twenty-five cents ($ in ). Fogler, now working for a bank in Kansas, arranged a loan for Munsey that grew to $8,000 ($ in ), with half Munsey&#x27;s stock as collateral. During the Panic of 1893 the bank called in the loan, and Munsey offered Fogler the stock if he would take over the loan. Fogler declined, and Munsey had to arrange for another loan at 18% interest to cover the repayment. In October1893 Munsey cut the price of &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; to ten cents ($ in ). He had to struggle to distribute it at this price, since the American News Company had a monopoly on magazine distribution and had little interest in a low-priced magazine. By the February issue Munsey was printing 200,000 copies, and it soon became successful enough to guarantee his financial security.

&quot;The Argosy&quot; did not share in the success of &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot;; circulation continued to decline, but Munsey kept it going, as he later said, &quot;as a matter of sentiment&quot;, and to see what could be made of it. From a high of 115,000 the circulation fell to 9,000 for the March 24, 1894 issue, which was the last one as a weekly. Munsey switched it to monthly publication with the April issue, and circulation jumped to 40,000 immediately, but went no higher for over two years. With the October1896 issue Munsey changed it to carry fiction only, targeted at adults rather than children. Starting with the December issue he began printing it on cheap wood-pulp paper, making &quot;The Argosy&quot; the first pulp magazine. The all-fiction format brought about another jump in circulation to 80,000. In 1898, with circulation still at around 80,000, Munsey bought &quot;Peterson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and merged it into &quot;The Argosy&quot;. A year or so later circulation began to climb again: Munsey spent nothing on advertising, but circulation reached 300,000 in 1902, and hit half a million in 1907, 25 years after it was launched. The magazine absorbed two other Munsey publications, &quot;The Puritan&quot; and &quot;Junior Munsey&quot;, in 1902, and Munsey credited some of the increase in circulation to the mergers.
&quot;The Argosy&quot;&#x27;s circulation fell from this peak, and it returned to a weekly schedule in 1917. In 1906 Munsey had started &quot;The Railroad Man&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which carried both fiction and non-fiction; after the January 18, 1919 issue it was merged into &quot;The Argosy&quot;, which was briefly retitled &quot;Argosy and Railroad Man&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, reverting to just &quot;Argosy&quot; with the May 31 issue. Paper shortages caused by World War I forced a reduction in the page count of both &quot;The Argosy&quot; and &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;, another Munsey fiction magazine, and costs continued to go up after the war. Most of the other major fiction magazines of the day increased their price to twenty cents ($ in ). At fifteen cents, &quot;Top-Notch Magazine&quot; was an exception, but Munsey kept both &quot;Argosy&quot; and &quot;All-Story&quot; at only ten cents. In 1920 he merged &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot; into &quot;The Argosy&quot;, explaining that this let him keep the price of the combined magazine at ten cents, while saving &quot;all the cost of stories in one magazine, all the cost of the editorial force, all the cost of typesetting, all the cost of making electrotype plates, and many other minor costs&quot;. Sam Moskowitz, a magazine historian, argues that the low price, sustained through most of the 1920s, must have been a strong benefit to circulation, which is reported to have reached half a million when the combined magazine, now titled &quot;Argosy All-Story Weekly&quot;, debuted. Circulation stayed at about 400,000 during the following decade. The first issue of the new magazine added pages to allow it to carry continuations of the serials that had been running in each of the two magazines before the merger, and Moskowitz comments that this approach &quot;was such that it is doubtful that a single nonduplicating reader was lost from either magazine&quot;. The page count gradually dropped again as the serials were completed, from 224 after the merger to 144 at the end of the year.

=== Dewart, Popular Publications, and later revivals ===
In December 1925 Munsey had appendicitis, and never recovered; he died, aged 71, on December 22. The Frank A. Munsey Corporation, which continued as the publisher, was sold to William Dewart, who had been working for Munsey. Matthew White, who had been editor since 1886, was finally replaced by A. H. Bittner in 1928. Bittner stayed as editor for three years; and his successors throughout the 1930s each lasted between one and three years. In October1929 &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Argosy All-Story Weekly&quot; were combined and immediately split again into two magazines: one was titled &quot;All-Story Combined with Munsey&#x27;s&quot;, and the other continued as &quot;Argosy&quot;.

In 1932 Don Moore, who had become editor in July1931, bought two stories from Frank Morgan Mercer that turned out to have been copied from earlier stories by H. Bedford-Jones and James Francis Dwyer. Up to this point &quot;Argosy&quot; paid on acceptance; because of the plagiarism the policy was changed to pay new authors only after publication, to allow plagiarism to be detected.

Moore left to work at &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in mid-1934, and was replaced by Frederick Clayton, who had been associate editor. In 1936 Clayton was hired by &quot;Liberty&quot;, and Jack Byrne, who had been working at Fiction House, took over as editor for a year before being replaced by Chandler Whipple. Another Munsey magazine, &quot;All-American Fiction&quot;, was merged into &quot;Argosy&quot; in 1938. In 1939 Whipple resigned and George Post, who had been part of Whipple&#x27;s editorial team, became editor.

&quot;Argosy&quot; remained a weekly until the October 4, 1941 issue, then switched to an irregular schedule with two issues a month. Post left in early 1942, and was briefly replaced by Harry Gray and then for two issues by Burroughs Mitchell.

In September1942 Popular Publications, a pulp magazine publisher, bought all the Munsey pulp magazine titles from Dewart, including &quot;Argosy&quot;, which by this time had a circulation of only 40,000 to 50,000. The new editor was Rogers Terrill. &quot;Argosy&quot; ceased to use pulp paper from 1943, becoming a slick magazine. In early 1944 Harry Steeger, the owner of Popular, took over the editorship for five years, hiring Jerry Mason away from &quot;This Week&quot; in 1949 to replace himself as editor. Mason stayed for four years; when he left in mid-1953 Howard Lewis was promoted to editor from executive editor. Lewis resigned in 1954, and was replaced for one issue (October 1954) by James O&#x27;Connell, who had been fiction editor of Argosy since 1948. Ken Purdy, the editor of &quot;Argosy&quot;&#x27;s main rival, &quot;True&quot;, was hired, but stayed less than a year. Steeger later said that hiring Purdy was the most expensive mistake he ever made; &quot;Argosy&quot; ran at a substantial loss under his editorship. Steeger then took the editing chair again. Circulation prospered under Popular, reaching 600,000 in June1948, and 1.25million by 1954. This growth was aided by some lucky publicity, broadcast to millions of radio listeners: after the acquisition by Popular, &quot;Argosy&quot; was the subject of a question on the popular &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; radio show, which referred to it as a pulp magazine. Two weeks later the show&#x27;s host apologized, and asked the studio audience to chant &quot;&quot;Argosy&quot; is a slick&quot; on the air.

Argosy&#x27;s circulation remained over a million until at least 1973, and the advertising revenue this provided made the magazine an attractive acquisition target. Steeger sold Popular Publications to David Geller&#x27;s Brookside Publications in 1972. In early January 1978 Geller sold the company to the Filipacchi Group. The last issue from Popular was dated November/December1978.

=== Special issues, associated magazines, and revivals ===
In addition to the monthly issues, between 1975 and 1978 &quot;Argosy&quot; published about fifty special issues on specific topics such as sharks, basketball, guns, or treasure hunting. There were also two associated magazines: &quot;Argosy UFO&quot; appeared in July 1976 and ceased publication with its eighth issue, dated Winter 1977/1978. &quot;Argosy Gun&quot; produced four issues dated from Fall 1977 and Summer 1978, and may have published more.

&quot;Argosy&quot; has been revived four times. Four monthly issues appeared starting in August1979, published by Lifetime Wholesalers, Inc. The last issue was dated November1979. Between 1989 and 1994, six issues were produced by Richard Kyle, at irregular intervals. Three more issues, dated in 2004 and 2005, appeared from Lou Anders and James A. Owen, with the third issue edited by Owen alone, and retitled &quot;Argosy Quarterly&quot;. One more issue, from Altus Press, appeared in 2016, edited by Matthew Moring.

==Contents and reception==

=== Early years ===

The first issue of &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot; included the first installment of two novels: &quot;Do and Dare, or a Brave Boy&#x27;s Fight for a Fortune&quot;, by Horatio Alger, which took the cover page, and &quot;Nick and Nellie, or God Helps them that Helps Themselves&quot;, by Edward S. Ellis. There were also short stories and some non-fiction. The target audience was both boys and girls, from ten to twenty years old. When Munsey began to write serialized novels for the magazine, starting with &quot;Afloat in a Great City&quot; in 1886, he used the same basic plot that Alger had been successful with: rags to riches stories of boys succeeding against the odds. Other early serials were boys&#x27; adventure tales, occasionally with science fiction ideas such as lost races. Multiple serials often ran simultaneously. Early contributors included Harry Castlemon, whose &quot;Don Gordon&#x27;s Shooting-Box&quot; began serialization in the March 3, 1883 issue; Frank H. Converse, who in addition to an early serial (&quot;A Voyage to the Gold Coast, or Jack Bond&#x27;s Quest&quot;, beginning in the March 24, 1883 issue) had several short stories in the first couple of years of the magazine; Oliver Optic, (&quot;Making a Man of Himself&quot;, beginning in the October 20, 1883 issue); and G. A. Henty (&quot;Facing Peril: A Tale of the Coal Mines&quot;, from September 5, 1885).

The magazine&#x27;s subtitle, &quot;Freighted with Treasures for Boys and Girls&quot;, was dropped in 1886, though the contents were still aimed at the same youthful readers as before. P. T. Barnum&#x27;s &quot;Dick Broadhead: a Story of Wild Animals and the Circus&quot; was serialized from May to August 1887. There was little science fiction in the early years; one exception was &quot;The Conquest of the Moon&quot;, by Andre Laurie, which began serialization in &quot;The Argosy&quot; in 1889; another was William Murray Graydon&#x27;s &quot;The River of Darkness; or, Under Africa&quot; (1890). &quot;When the Redcoats Came to Bennington&quot;, an early story by Upton Sinclair, appeared in the December 1895 issue.

=== Pulp era ===

==== Editorial policy ====

After the change to an all-fiction monthly format in 1896, &quot;The Argosy&quot; was a men&#x27;s and boy&#x27;s adventure magazine, though &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; describes many of the serials in the first decade or so after the change as &quot;still only a little above juvenile adventure stories&quot;. In 1926, Albert William Stone, a fairly prolific pulp author, visited Manhattan to meet with the editors of the various magazines he had been selling to, and find out more about what their requirements were for submissions. Stone had sold several stories to Bob Davis, the editor of &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;, before its merger with &quot;The Argosy&quot;, but had never sold to Matthew White, who had been editor of &quot;The Argosy&quot; since before the change to pulp format. White had sent Stone an encouraging note in reply to an early submission of his: &quot;Two things I like about this story are its Western atmosphere, and its brevity—two thousand five hundred words ... If those hints are of any value to you, try us again.&quot; In the interview with Stone, White expanded upon what he was looking for. &quot;I require yarns ... that violate the traditions relative to &#x27;logical development&#x27;. By this I mean that I do not want the story developed in what is commonly called the &#x27;natural&#x27; way. I require &quot;unexpected&quot; development—surprises at every turn it is possible to have them without destroying the convincingness of the story ... In other words, stories that are a constant challenge to the author&#x27;s inventive ability, one situation after another, and that keep the writer perspiring freely.&quot;

Ed Hulse, a historian of pulp magazines, while generally praising the quality of the fiction in &quot;Argosy&quot; during the pulp era, comments that during the 1920s some &quot;bland, conventional dramas&quot; appeared in the magazine, by writers such as Edgar Franklin, Isabel Ostrander, and E. J. Rath. Hulse suggests that this editorial policy was aimed at attracting more women readers to the magazine.

After White&#x27;s editorship, and for the next fifteen years, the requirements that &quot;Argosy&quot;&#x27;s editors sent to writers&#x27; magazines such as &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot; and &quot;Author &amp; Journalist&quot; emphasized that they were looking for stories focused on action, with a masculine point of view. Bittner&#x27;s comments in 1928 asked for &quot;any good clean story with sound plot, rapid-fire action and strong masculine appeal&quot;, and gave a long list of genres all of which were acceptable—even romance so long as &quot;the love element is not unduly stressed&quot;. In 1931 Moore outlined the stories to be excluded: &quot;love or domestic tales, sex stories, stories with a predominant woman interest or told from a woman’s viewpoint&quot;. In 1935 Clayton provided a list of hackneyed plots to be avoided, including escaping convicts, an underwater adventure in which the hero fights an octopus and a giant clam as well as the villain, and a legionnaire who &quot;dies gloriously for Dear Old France&quot;. The policy of action stories told from a male viewpoint continued through the rest of the decade.

==== New writers ====

Many writers who later became well-known sold to &quot;The Argosy&quot; early in their careers. William MacLeod Raine&#x27;s first story, &quot;The Luck of Eustace Blount&quot;, appeared in the March 1899 issue. William Wallace Cook contributed numerous serials in the first decade of the 20th century, beginning with &quot;The Spur of Necessity&quot; in the September1900 issue after half-a-dozen sales to other markets. Cook wrote adventure fiction with elements of satire, an unusual combination for the pulps. James Branch Cabell&#x27;s first sale was to &quot;The Argosy&quot;; his &quot;An Amateur Ghost&quot; appeared in the February1902 issue. William Hamilton Osborne&#x27;s first sale was also to &quot;The Argosy&quot;, but after paying for it White returned the story to Osborne as the plot was too similar to other stories that had appeared elsewhere. It did eventually appear in the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;, but Osborne&#x27;s first appearance in print was in &quot;The Argosy&quot; with &quot;Turner&#x27;s Luck with Rouge et Noir&quot;, in the September 1902 issue. Louis Joseph Vance, the creator of the character The Lone Wolf, published most of his fiction in &quot;The Popular Magazine&quot;, but his first two sales were to Munsey, including &quot;The Coil of Circumstance&quot;, a serial that began in the November 1903 &quot;Argosy&quot;. Albert Payson Terhune, later the author of &quot;Lad: A Dog&quot;, frequently published in the Munsey magazines early in his career. His first sale to &quot;The Argosy&quot; was &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, a novella that began serialization in the August 1905 issue, and he sold a dozen more stories to the magazine over the next few years. An early story by Mary Roberts Rinehart, &quot;The Misadventures of a Pearl Necklace&quot;, appeared in February the following year.

==== Science fiction and fantasy ====
The first pulp issue, in December 1896, included a science fiction story, &quot;Citizen 504&quot;, by C. H. Palmer, and science fiction featured regularly thereafter. Five science fiction adventure novels by William Wallace Cook appeared, starting in 1903 with &quot;A Round Trip to the Year 2000, or A Flight Through Time&quot;. Lost race stories continued to appear, such as Frank Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;A Queen of Atlantis&quot; (1899), Frank Savile&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Great South Wall&quot; (1899–1900), and Perley Poore Sheehan&#x27;s &quot;The Abyss of Wonders&quot; (1915), described by Hulse as &quot;arguably the finest lost race novel ever to appear in a Munsey magazine&quot;. Francis Stevens contributed another lost world novel, &quot;The Citadel of Fear&quot;, in 1918.

Humorous stories about scientific inventions were another theme. Howard Rogert Garis began selling to &quot;Argosy&quot; in 1904; his &quot;Professor Jonkin&quot; stories were lighthearted examples of the genre, and other examples came from H.D. Smiley, whose &quot;Bagley&#x27;s Coagulated Cyclone&quot; and &quot;Bagley&#x27;s Rain-Machine&quot; appeared in the September 1906 and February 1907 issues. Some more sophisticated science fiction also appeared, including &quot;Finis&quot;, an end of the world story by Frank Lillie Pollock, in June 1906. George Griffith, an important early science fiction writer from the UK, published almost none of his work in the US in his lifetime. An exception was &quot;The Lake of Gold&quot;, serialized in &quot;The Argosy&quot; from December 1902 to July 1903, in which a group of Britons and Americans use the riches from a lake of gold in Patagonia to enforce peace across Europe.

&quot;The Argosy&quot;&#x27;s sister magazine, &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;, was the venue for most of the science fiction in the Munsey magazines, but &quot;Argosy&quot; printed Murray Leinster&#x27;s first science fiction story, &quot;The Runaway Skyscraper&quot;, in 1919. Leinster&#x27;s first sale, &quot;The Atmosphere&quot;, had appeared in &quot;The Argosy&quot; the previous year. Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s Barsoom series had begun in &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;, as had his Tarzan novels; when the two magazines merged in 1920 later episodes of each series appeared in the combined magazine, &quot;Argosy All-Story Weekly&quot;. Abraham Merritt&#x27;s &quot;The Metal Monster&quot; began serialization in the August 7 issue, the third one after the merger, and many more science fiction and fantasy stories followed in the next two decades by authors such as Ray Cummings, Ralph Milne Farley, Otis Adelbert Kline, Victor Rousseau, Eando Binder, Donald Wandrei, Manly Wade Wellman, Jack Williamson, Arthur Leo Zagat, and Henry Kuttner. Merritt&#x27;s &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot;, which was serialized in 1924, was voted &quot;Argosy&quot;&#x27;s most popular story in a reader poll in 1938. In 1940 and 1941 Frederick C. Painton published a series of stories in &quot;Argosy&quot; about Joel Quaite, a time detective who travels into the past to solve mysteries.

Erle Stanley Gardner, later famous for his Perry Mason detective stories, sold &quot;Rain Magic&quot;, his first science fiction short story, to &quot;Argosy&quot; in 1928, and went on to write several more. Gardner combined science fiction with detective plots in some of these stories, and he was not the only writer to do so: Garret Smith&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Killed Privacy!&quot; in the July 7, 1928 &quot;Argosy&quot; was about using CCTV to catch criminals, and Leinster&#x27;s &quot;Darkness on Fifth Avenue&quot;, in the November 30, 1929 &quot;Argosy&quot;, about a device that can bring artificial darkness to an area, was originally intended for the detective pulps.

==== Other genres ====

&quot;Argosy&quot;&#x27;s Western fiction included Zane Grey&#x27;s &quot;Last of the Duanes&quot;, which appeared in the September 1914 &quot;Argosy&quot;, and Walt Coburn&#x27;s first story, &quot;The Peace Treaty of the Seven Up&quot;, in the July 8, 1922 issue. Max Brand, a very prolific Western writer, sold his first pulp stories to &quot;All-Story&quot; in 1917, but by the end of the year had begun selling to &quot;Argosy&quot; too. Clarence Mulford was the creator of the character Hopalong Cassidy; the first few stories in the series appeared in other magazines, but many were published in &quot;Argosy&quot; in the early 1920s. Robert E. Howard, best known for his stories about Conan the Barbarian, also wrote Westerns, several of which were published in &quot;Argosy&quot; in the mid-1930s.

O. Henry appeared in the March 1904 &quot;Argosy&quot; with &quot;Witches Loaves&quot;. H. Bedford-Jones, a popular author with over 1,000 stories published in the pulps over his career, sold his first story, &quot;Out of a Stormy Sky&quot;, to &quot;The Argosy&quot; in 1910, and appeared in its pages regularly for the next four decades. Bedford-Jones&#x27;s series about adventurer John Solomon began with &quot;The Gate of Farewell&quot;, serialized in the January and February 1914 issues, and continued in &quot;The Argosy&quot; and elsewhere for over twenty years. George Worts published the first of his &quot;Peter the Brazen&quot; series, about an &quot;expert wireless operator and dauntless adventurer&quot;, in &quot;Argosy&quot; in the October 5, 1918 issue; it became one of the most popular series in the magazine, with all twenty stories appearing in &quot;Argosy&quot; into the mid-1930s. Under his own name and a pseudonym, Loring Brent, Worts contributed scores of other stories to &quot;Argosy&quot; over the same period. Johnston McCulley had launched his Zorro series in &quot;All-Story&quot; in 1919 and more episodes appeared in &quot;Argosy&quot; after the two magazines merged.

Fred MacIsaac, one of &quot;Argosy&quot;&#x27;s most popular authors, first appeared in the November 1, 1924 issue with the first installment of his novel &quot;Nothing but Money&quot;. Most of MacIsaac&#x27;s work was not science fiction; an exception was &quot;The Hothouse World&quot;, a serial that ran in &quot;Argosy&quot; from February 21 to March 28, 1931. Theodore Roscoe was a frequent contributor of adventure stories set in exotic locations such as Timbuktu and Saigon. He traveled the world once his writing began to pay him well enough to allow him to do so, and used the experience to add color to his stories. Borden Chase sold his first story, &quot;Tunnel Men&quot;, to &quot;Argosy&quot; in 1934 while he was a laborer on the tunnel being built under the East River in New York. He became a regular contributor, and his &quot;East River&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Argosy&quot; in December 1934, was filmed the following year as &quot;Under Pressure&quot;. &quot;Ship of the Line&quot;, an early novel in C. S. Forester&#x27;s stories about Horatio Hornblower, was serialized in Argosy in early 1938. Max Brand, though best known for his Westerns, wrote in many other genres as well, including historical fiction and mystery stories. He was the creator of Dr. Kildare, and four novels in the series appeared in &quot;Argosy&quot; between 1938 and 1940. Mystery contributors included Cornell Woolrich, beginning with &quot;Hot Water&quot; in the December 28, 1935 issue, and Norbert Davis.

==== Art ====
In 1903 Street &amp; Smith launched &quot;The Popular Magazine&quot;, an early pulp rival to &quot;The Argosy&quot; with color art on the cover. Up to this point &quot;The Argosy&quot; had had text only on the cover, and no art, but in 1905, probably in response to &quot;The Popular Magazine&quot;, it began to run limited color art on the cover, and in 1912 it began to use full-color cover art. At the start of the 1920s the most frequent cover artists for &quot;Argosy&quot; were Modest Stein, Stockton Mulford, and P. J Monahan; by the end of the decade Paul Stahr and Robert Graef had taken over most of the covers, and remained the main cover artists until the mid-1930s. Hulse considers the artwork of this era to have been &quot;consistently good&quot;. Towards the end of the 1930s Rudolph Belarski, Emmett Watson, and George Rozen become regular cover artists.

Virgil Finlay was a popular illustrator for the Munsey magazines at the end of the 1930s and start of the 1940s. When &quot;Argosy&quot; planned to reprint &quot;Seven Footprints to Satan&quot;, one of A. Merritt&#x27;s novels, in 1939, Merritt persuaded the editor, G. W. Post, to use Finlay as the interior illustrator.

== Men&#x27;s magazine era ==

=== Transition from pulp format ===

In 1942, in an attempt to revive the magazine&#x27;s fortunes, the all-fiction format was abandoned and articles about World War II and &quot;sensationalized&quot; news stories were added. The cover was redesigned starting with the March 7, 1942, issue, with the outline of a jet plane replacing the galleon behind the title, and a picture of the film star Dorothy Lamour on the cover instead of the usual adventure-themed cover art. The title was changed to &quot;The New Argosy&quot;, though this change was reversed with the August issue. The publication frequency was changed to monthly starting in May.

The new version of &quot;Argosy&quot; was almost immediately caught in a crackdown by Frank Walker, the Postmaster General. The Post Office declared that publishers should consider &quot;decency and good morals&quot; in deciding what could be included in a mailed magazine, and promptly notified dozens of publishers that they had to attend a hearing in Washington or lose their permits. &quot;Argosy&quot;&#x27;s citation from the Post Office listed stories considered to be obscene; the list included &quot;The G-String Murders&quot;, a serial by Rose Louise Hovick (better known as the burlesque performer Gypsy Rose Lee) that began in May 1942, and &quot;How Paris Apaches Terrorize Nazis in Girl Orgies&quot; and &quot;Sex Outrages by Jap Soldiers&quot;, articles in the July and August 1942 issues. The hearings were thought by most publishers to be pointless, and nobody from Munsey attended. &quot;Argosy&quot; briefly lost its permit as a result, but did not miss any issues.

When Popular Publications acquired &quot;Argosy&quot; at the end of 1942, they announced that it would immediately return to a fiction-only format. Richard Abbott, the editor of &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot;, commented that Popular were &quot;again making &quot;Argosy&quot; the fine old book it was&quot;, and that when they acquired &quot;Argosy&quot; it had &quot;recently been degraded by wretched editing&quot;. In September1943, the format changed from pulp to slick, but Popular still planned to print only fiction. Rogers Terrill, the editor, announced that &quot;we have stepped out of the pulp field entirely ... We felt there was room in the country for an all-fiction slick, and we&#x27;re it.&quot;

=== Slick men&#x27;s magazine era ===

By the end of 1943, the policy had changed back to include feature articles again as well as fiction. This made &quot;Argosy&quot; a competitor with slick general men&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;True&quot;. The publisher, Harry Steeger, later explained the reason for the change of focus, arguing that women had been the primary target for advertisers before World War II, but afterwards &quot;new buying pursuits were adopted by the male and it began to be recognized by the advertising agencies that the male was an individual to be reckoned with in the purchase of all types of products ...&quot;. The non-fiction material was mostly written in-house; in 1950 &quot;Argosy&quot; rejected over 99% of the unsolicited non-fiction manuscripts it received.

After &quot;Argosy&quot; was acquired by Popular Publications, less science fiction appeared for a couple of years. Exceptions included some of Walter R. Brooks&#x27; Mr. Ed stories. The late 1940s saw more science fiction again, with stories by Nelson Bond, A. Bertram Chandler, and Robert A. Heinlein, whose &quot;Gentlemen, Be Seated!&quot; appeared in the May 1948 issue, and in the 1950s &quot;Argosy&quot; published work by Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, and Philip José Farmer. In 1977 one of &quot;Argosy&quot;&#x27;s special issues was devoted to science fiction; the stories in it were all reprinted from Popular&#x27;s &quot;Super Science Stories&quot;, rather than from earlier issues of &quot;Argosy&quot;.

In September 1948 Erle Stanley Gardner began a true-crime column in &quot;Argosy&quot; called &quot;The Court of Last Resort&quot;. Gardner enlisted assistance from professional experts to examine the cases of dozens of convicts who maintained their innocence after their appeals were exhausted. The column ran for ten years, ending in October 1958, and was adapted for television as a 26-episode series by NBC. Many of the convictions were eventually overturned.

== Assessment ==
John Clute, discussing the American pulp magazines in the first two decades of the twentieth century, has described &quot;The Argosy&quot; and its companion &quot;The All-Story&quot; as &quot;the most important pulps of their era.&quot; In the era before the Second World War, &quot;Argosy&quot; was regarded as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; pulp magazines, along with &quot;Blue Book&quot;, &quot;Adventure&quot; and &quot;Short Stories.&quot; In the early 1960s Theodore Peterson, a magazine historian, considered the slick incarnation of &quot;Argosy&quot;, along with &quot;True&quot;, to be &quot;the best magazines of their kind&quot;. Peterson suggests that it was the success of these two magazines that led to the expansion of the men&#x27;s magazine market during the 1950s.

== Additional bibliographic details ==
=== Titles ===
&quot;Argosy&quot;&#x27;s title changed many times, either in an attempt to attract more readers, or because of mergers with other magazines.
=== Reprint magazines and anthologies ===
The long history of &quot;Argosy&quot; meant that by the 1930s there were many stories readers had heard of but could no longer obtain. In response to reader requests, Munsey launched &quot;Famous Fantastic Mysteries&quot; in 1939 to reprint old stories from both &quot;Argosy&quot; and &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;. The following year Munsey launched &quot;Fantastic Novels&quot;, another reprint magazine, to make longer stories available without needing to serialize them in &quot;Famous Fantastic Mysteries&quot;. &quot;Fantastic Novels&quot; only lasted five issues before being discontinued in 1941, but &quot;Famous Fantastic Mysteries&quot; lasted for 81 issues, ceasing publication with the June 1953 issue. Popular brought back &quot;Fantastic Novels&quot; for another 20 issues between 1948 and 1951, and also produced five issues of &quot;A. Merritt&#x27;s Fantasy Magazine&quot;, also as a reprint venue for stories from the old Munsey magazines, between 1949 and 1950.

In 1976 Popular published two anthology magazines of stories, mostly science fiction and fantasy, titled &quot;The Best of Argosy Annual&quot;, though only some of the stories included had originally appeared in &quot;Argosy&quot;. A collection of science fiction stories from the early years of &quot;The Argosy&quot; was edited by Gene Christie and published in 2010, titled &quot;The Space Annihilator and Other Early Science Fiction From the Argosy&quot;.

There was a Canadian reprint edition; the first and last known issues were dated April 21, 1924, and July 1960.

<text>The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction (usually referred to as F&amp;SF) is a U.S. fantasy and science-fiction magazine, first published in 1949 by Mystery House, a subsidiary of Lawrence Spivak&#x27;s Mercury Press. Editors Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas had approached Spivak in the mid-1940s about creating a fantasy companion to Spivak&#x27;s existing mystery title, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. The first issue was titled &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy&quot;, but the decision was quickly made to include science fiction as well as fantasy, and the title was changed correspondingly with the second issue. &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; was quite different in presentation from the existing science-fiction magazines of the day, most of which were in pulp format: it had no interior illustrations, no letter column, and text in a single-column format, which in the opinion of science-fiction historian Mike Ashley &quot;set &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine&quot;.

&quot;F&amp;SF&quot; quickly became one of the leading magazines in the science-fiction and fantasy fields, with a reputation for publishing literary material and including more diverse stories than its competitors. Well-known stories that appeared in its early years include Richard Matheson&#x27;s &quot;Born of Man and Woman&quot;, and Ward Moore&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot;, a novel of an alternative history in which the South has won the American Civil War. McComas left for health reasons in 1954, but Boucher continued as sole editor until 1958, winning the Hugo Award for Best Magazine that year, a feat his successor, Robert Mills, repeated in the next two years. Mills was responsible for publishing &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; by Daniel Keyes, &quot;Rogue Moon&quot; by Algis Budrys, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; by Robert Heinlein, and the first of Brian Aldiss&#x27;s &quot;Hothouse&quot; stories. The first few issues mostly featured cover art by George Salter, Mercury Press&#x27;s art director, but other artists soon began to appear, including Chesley Bonestell, Kelly Freas, and Ed Emshwiller.

In 1962, Mills was succeeded as editor by Avram Davidson. When Davidson left at the end of 1964, Joseph Ferman, who had bought the magazine from Spivak in 1954, took over briefly as editor, though his son Edward soon began doing the editorial work under his father&#x27;s supervision. At the start of 1966, Edward Ferman was listed as editor, and four years later, he acquired the magazine from his father and moved the editorial offices to his house in Connecticut. Ferman remained editor for over 25 years, and published many well-received stories, including Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;Ill Met in Lankhmar&quot;, Robert Silverberg&#x27;s &quot;Born with the Dead&quot;, and Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series. In 1991, he turned the editorship over to Kristine Kathryn Rusch, who began including more horror and dark fantasy than had appeared under Ferman. In the mid-1990s, circulation began to decline; most American magazines were losing subscribers and &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; was no exception. Gordon Van Gelder replaced Rusch in 1997, and bought the magazine from Ferman in 2001, but circulation continued to fall, and by 2011 it was below 15,000. Charles Coleman Finlay took over from Van Gelder as editor in 2015. Sheree Renée Thomas succeeded Charles Coleman Finlay, becoming the magazine&#x27;s 10th editor in the fall of 2020.

== Publication history ==

=== Lawrence Spivak ===

The first magazine dedicated to fantasy, &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, appeared in 1923; it was followed in 1926 by &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, the first science fiction (sf) magazine. By the end of the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, nearly twenty new sf and fantasy titles appearing between 1938 and 1941. These were all pulp magazines, which meant that despite the occasional high-quality story, most of the magazines presented badly written fiction and were regarded as trash by many readers. In 1941, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; appeared, edited by Fred Dannay and focusing on detective fiction. The magazine was published in digest format, rather than pulp, and printed a mixture of classic stories and fresh material. Dannay attempted to avoid the sensationalist fiction appearing in the pulps, and soon made the magazine a success.

In the early 1940s Anthony Boucher, a successful writer of fantasy and sf and also of mystery stories, got to know Dannay through his work on the Ellery Queen radio show. Boucher also knew J. Francis McComas, an editor who shared his interest in fantasy and SF. By 1944 McComas and Boucher became interested in the idea of a fantasy companion to &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, and spoke to Dannay about it. Dannay was interested in the idea, but paper was scarce because of World War II. The following year Boucher and McComas suggested that the new magazine could use the Ellery Queen name, but Dannay knew little about fantasy and suggested instead that they approach Lawrence Spivak, the owner of Mercury Press, which published &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;.

In January 1946, Boucher and McComas went to New York and met with Spivak, who let them know later in the year that he wanted to go ahead. At Spivak&#x27;s request they began acquiring material for the new magazine, including a new story by Raymond Chandler, and reprint rights to stories by H.P. Lovecraft, John Dickson Carr, and Robert Bloch. Spivak initially planned the first issue (for which Boucher and McComas were proposing the title &quot;Fantasy and Horror&quot;) for early 1947, but repeatedly delayed the launch because of poor newsstand sales of digest magazines. He also suggested that it should be priced at 35 cents an issue, which was higher than the original plan, to provide a financial buffer against poor sales. In May 1949 Spivak suggested a new title, &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy&quot;, and in August a press release announced that the magazine would appear in October. On October 6, 1949, Spivak, Boucher and McComas held a luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of Edgar Allan Poe and to launch &quot;a new fantasy anthology periodical&quot;. Invitees included Carr, Basil Rathbone, and Boris Karloff.

The first issue, published by Fantasy House, a subsidiary of American Mercury, sold 57,000 copies, which was less than Spivak had hoped for, but in November he gave Boucher and McComas the go-ahead for another issue. The title was changed to &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; (almost always abbreviated to &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; by both fans and science fiction historians) to reflect the contents. Sales of the second issue were strong enough for Spivak to commit further, and the magazine&#x27;s future became more assured, despite the difficulties caused by the fact that both Boucher and McComas lived on the west coast, whereas the magazine&#x27;s publishing offices were in New York. The publishing schedule moved to bimonthly with the December 1950 issue. The pay rate for the early issues was two cents per word, or $100 for short pieces, which was competitive with &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, the leading sf magazine of the day. By 1953 the rates had changed to three-and-a-half cents per word for stories under 3,000 words.

In 1951, McComas, who had a full-time job in sales on top of his role as editor of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, was forced to reduce his workload for health reasons. Boucher then did most of the reading and editing, while McComas reviewed the results and occasionally vetoed a story. In August the following year the schedule switched to monthly. In 1954 Spivak sold his shares in Mercury Press to his general manager, Joseph Ferman; that year also saw McComas&#x27;s departure—his health had deteriorated to the point where he had to give up the editing post completely.

=== The Fermans and Gordon Van Gelder ===
In 1957 Ferman launched a companion magazine, &quot;Venture Science Fiction&quot;, which was intended to focus on more action-oriented fiction than &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;. Boucher was unable to take on the extra work, so Robert P. Mills, who had been the managing editor for &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, became &quot;Venture&quot;″s editor, with Boucher in an advisory role. Later that year Ferman sold &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; to Bernard Davis, who was leaving Ziff-Davis to start his own publishing venture. Ferman retained &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, though Boucher departed, and Mills became the editor of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; while remaining managing editor of Queen&#x27;s magazine. Mills stayed for over three years, leaving at the end of 1961 to spend more time working as a literary agent, and Ferman replaced him with Avram Davidson, whose name first appeared on the masthead with the April 1962 issue. Joseph Ferman&#x27;s son Edward had worked for the magazine as an editorial assistant in the 1950s, but left in 1959 to gain experience elsewhere; he returned in 1962, and worked under Davidson as managing editor. In 1963 Ted White, later the editor of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, became assistant editor, and stayed with the magazine until 1968.

Davidson gave up the editor&#x27;s chair in late 1964 in order to have more time to write, and was initially replaced by Joseph Ferman, who handed over control to his son Edward from May 1965, though the masthead did not reflect the change till 1966. Four years later the younger Ferman took over from his father as publisher as well, and moved the editorial and publishing offices to his house in Cornwall, Connecticut. His wife, Audrey, was business manager, and Andrew Porter was an assistant editor. In the early 1970s Ferman contacted Sol Cohen, the owner of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Stories&quot;, two competing sf magazines, about purchasing them both. Ferman was considering combining them into a single magazine and publishing them alongside &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, but Cohen decided to keep both titles.

In 1969, an issue of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; was priced at 50 cents; by the end of the 1970s the price had gone up to $1.25, although the page count also rose, from 128 to 160 pages. Circulation did not suffer, but rose from 50,000 to over 60,000, partly because of subscription drives through Publishers&#x27; Clearing House, and perhaps also because the magazine&#x27;s quality remained consistent throughout the decade. In Ashley&#x27;s words, &quot;&quot;F&amp;SF&quot; delivered the goods month after month&quot;: the schedule was reliable, the format remained unchanged, and the editor remained the same from 1965 throughout the next two decades and more. Ferman managed to keep the circulation above 50,000, and sometimes above 60,000, during the 1980s when most other magazines were losing subscribers. He turned over the editorship to Kristine Kathryn Rusch in 1991, and by the mid-1990s circulation began to fall again. In 1997 Gordon Van Gelder took over as editor, and from the February 2001 issue was publisher as well, having bought the magazine from Ferman. John Joseph Adams was Van Gelder&#x27;s assistant editor from 2001 until December 2009. Van Gelder was unable to arrest the decline in circulation, which by 2011 was down to less than 15,000. Van Gelder reduced the publication frequency to bimonthly, increasing the page count and price. Charles Coleman Finlay guest-edited the July/August 2014 issue, and was hired in 2015 as full-time editor, beginning with the March/April 2015 issue. Sheree Renée Thomas was hired as editor, beginning with the March/April 2021 issue. 

== Contents and reception ==

=== Boucher, McComas, Mills and Davidson ===
Boucher and McComas&#x27;s original goal for the new magazine was to imitate the formula that had made &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; successful: classic reprints, along with quality fiction that avoided the excesses of the pulps. The initial proposal called for the magazine to include fantasy, but not science fiction. Even before the launch, the editors found they were having trouble deciding exactly where the boundary lay, so when in February 1949 Joseph Ferman, Spivak&#x27;s general manager, asked them to add sf to the lineup as a way to broaden the readership, they were happy to comply. The first issue included only one story that could be called science fiction: Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s &quot;The Hurkle Is a Happy Beast&quot;; it also included reprints from the slick magazines by writers such as Richard Sale, and Guy Endore. The interior layout was quite different from the existing fantasy and sf magazines: there were no interior illustrations, and the text was printed in a single column, instead of two as was usual elsewhere. There was a book review column, but no letters page. According to sf historian Mike Ashley, this &quot;set &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine&quot;. The logo design and layout were the work of Mercury Press&#x27;s art director, George Salter, whose background was in book design rather than in pulp magazines. Salter remained with the magazine until 1958. He was responsible for many of the surreal early covers; these gave way to work by other artists, but his design for &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; remained intact for decades, and in Ashley&#x27;s opinion the consistency of appearance has been &quot;one of the major selling points&quot; of the magazine.

When the second issue appeared, with the title revised to include &quot;Science Fiction&quot;, there was no announcement of the change, and not much more science fiction than in the first issue. Damon Knight contributed one example, &quot;Not with a Bang&quot;, which Knight has described as his first fully professional story. The next issue included Richard Matheson&#x27;s first sale, &quot;Born of Man and Woman&quot;, widely considered one of the finest stories &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; ever published. Over the next few years several writers became strongly associated with the magazine, including Margaret St. Clair, Reginald Bretnor, Miriam Allen deFord, and Zenna Henderson, and Boucher was also able to attract some of the best-known established names, such as Arthur C. Clarke, Fritz Leiber, and Ray Bradbury. Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp began their &quot;Gavagan&#x27;s Bar&quot; series of stories in the first issue of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, and Manly Wade Wellman published the first of his &quot;John the Balladeer&quot; stories in the December 1951 issue. The focus was on short fiction; serials and novels were mainly avoided. One exception was Ward Moore&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot;, an alternative history set in a world where the South wins the American Civil War. Boucher bought &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; from Walter M. Miller, who had been unable to sell it elsewhere, and printed it in the April 1955 issue; it was the first story in the series that would become the novel of the same name, and has since become recognized as a classic of the genre.

A controversial article by the astronomer R.S. Richardson titled &quot;The Day After We Land on Mars&quot; appeared in the December 1955 issue; Richardson commented that an exploration of other worlds would require &quot;the men stationed on a planet [to be] openly accompanied by women to relieve the sexual tensions that develop among normal healthy males&quot;. Responses by Poul Anderson and Miriam Allen deFord appeared in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; the following year. DeFord argued that Richardson was assuming that women were not people in the same way as men, and the controversy has since been cited as part of the long debate within the genre about the image of women in science fiction.

In 1958 &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; won its first Hugo Award for Best Magazine, and when Mills became editor that year he maintained the high standards Boucher had set, winning the award again in 1959 and 1960. Mills continued to publish a broad range of material without limiting the magazine to particular subgenres. Ashley cites John Collier, Robert Arthur, Allen Drury, and Ray Bradbury, all authors with mainstream reputations who appeared in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; in 1960, as evidence of the magazine&#x27;s diversity. Daniel Keyes had been unable to sell &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; until Mills bought it in 1959; it went on to win several awards and according to Clute and Nicholls is &quot;arguably the most popular sf novel ever published&quot;. &quot;Rogue Moon&quot;, a novel about a deadly artifact left by aliens on the moon, is often considered Algis Budrys&#x27;s best novel; it appeared in 1960, and the following year saw Brian Aldiss&#x27;s &quot;Hothouse&quot;, the first in that series. (Budrys later said that what he described as the &quot;cuteness of the early F&amp;SF school of editing—and its open contempt for the accomplishments of the Campbellian school&quot; had resulted in &quot;buckets and buckets of froth&quot; but, more favorably, &quot;Liberal Arts concepts in what had been almost exclusively a B. S. field&quot;.) Zenna Henderson&#x27;s stories of The People, a group of refugee humanoid aliens hiding on Earth, were published through the 1950s and 1960s and became a &quot;central feature&quot; of the magazine according to sf critic John Clute. Boucher published Damon Knight&#x27;s &quot;The Country of the Kind&quot;, described by Ashley as &quot;one of his most potent stories from the fifties&quot;, in 1956, and the same year, under the pseudonym &quot;Grendel Briarton&quot;, Reginald Bretnor began a series of punning stories known as &quot;Feghoots&quot; that lasted until 1964. At the end of the 1950s, during Mills&#x27; tenure as editor, Robert Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was serialized in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, under the title &quot;Starship Soldier&quot;; this was intended to be a juvenile novel but was rejected by Scribner&#x27;s for being too violent. It won the Hugo Award in the novel category the following year, and proved to be one of Heinlein&#x27;s most controversial books.

Among the cover artists in the first decade, sf historian and critic Thomas Clareson singles out the early astronomical scenes by Chesley Bonestell as being the most notable; these were among the first to replace George Salter&#x27;s surreal artwork on the cover. Kelly Freas and Ed Emshwiller, two of the most popular artists in the sf field, also contributed covers during the 1950s. Mel Hunter began contributing covers with the November 1953 issue, and in October 1955 began a long-running series of covers that depicted a robot survivor of a nuclear holocaust engaging in human activities amidst the desolation—watering a flower, playing with toys, or reading a store catalog, for example. A regular book review column appeared, titled &quot;Recommended Reading&quot;; it was signed simply &quot;The Editors&quot; until McComas ceased to be one of the co-editors, after which Boucher used his own name. According to Clareson, the column &quot;long remained the most catholic appraisal of the field&quot; because of the variety of works reviewed. Boucher did not review his own fiction in the column, though on at least one occasion he listed a new book of his, telling the reader: &quot;Comments eagerly welcomed; in this case, you are the reviewer&quot;. When Boucher left, he was succeeded by Damon Knight as book reviewer; Alfred Bester took over in 1960 and remained in the role until Avram Davidson became the book reviewer when he took the editorial chair. Isaac Asimov had begun a series of science articles for &quot;Venture Science Fiction&quot; in January 1958, and when &quot;Venture&quot; was cancelled Mills brought the science column over to &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;. The column, which according to Asimov he enjoyed writing more than any of his other works, ran for decades without interruption, helping to contribute to a long-standing feeling of consistency and continuity in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;″s format and contents.

Avram Davidson, who became editor in 1962, had sold his first story to &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; in 1954, though he was better remembered for &quot;The Golem&quot;, which appeared in the March 1955 issue. Under Davidson more work appeared by non-English-speaking writers such as Hugo Correa, Herbert Franke, and Shin&#x27;ishi Hoshi. Notable stories he acquired for &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; include Terry Carr&#x27;s first sale, &quot;Who Sups with the Devil?&quot;, in 1962, and Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;A Rose for Ecclesiastes&quot; in November 1963. He published two &quot;author special&quot; issues: Theodore Sturgeon was featured in the September 1962 issue, and Ray Bradbury in May 1963. These author issues, which had been Joseph Ferman&#x27;s idea, became a regular feature, with subsequent issues featuring Isaac Asimov (October 1966), Fritz Leiber (July 1969), Poul Anderson (April 1971), James Blish (April 1972), Frederik Pohl (September 1973), Robert Silverberg (April 1974), Damon Knight (November 1976), Harlan Ellison (July 1977), Stephen King (December 1990), Lucius Shepard (March 2001), Kate Wilhelm (September 2001), Barry N. Malzberg (June 2003), Gene Wolfe (April 2007), and David Gerrold (September/October 2016).

=== Edward Ferman ===
Joseph Ferman&#x27;s son, Edward Ferman, was managing editor during Davidson&#x27;s tenure as editor. When Davidson left, Joseph Ferman took over the editorial chair, but in reality Edward Ferman was doing all the editorial work, and by the May 1965 issue was in full control of the magazine. It remained eclectic through the 1960s and 1970s, publishing work by New Wave writers such as Thomas Disch and John Sladek, along with new US writers such as Samuel Delany and Roger Zelazny, hard science fiction stories by Gregory Benford and John Varley, fantasies by Sterling Lanier and Tom Reamy, and horror by Charles L. Grant and Stephen King. The mid-1960s saw an increase in the diversity of stories appearing elsewhere in the field; magazines like &quot;New Worlds&quot; and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; published material that previously could only have appeared in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;. Sf author Christopher Priest, writing in 1978, commented that many writers later considered part of the New Wave soon found &quot;a natural home for their work&quot; in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;. In Ashley&#x27;s view the rest of the field was starting to catch up to &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;″s open-mindedness, but this did not lead to a drop in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;″s quality; the end of the 1960s saw Ferman printing some old-fashioned material such as John Christopher&#x27;s novel about miniaturization, &quot;The Little People&quot;, alongside much of Roger Zelazny&#x27;s early output, and &quot;anarchic and often indefinable&quot; stories by R.A. Lafferty, Harvey Jacobs, and others. In 1968, Piers Anthony&#x27;s early novel &quot;Sos the Rope&quot; was serialized; Anthony had won a competition sponsored in part by &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;.

Harlan Ellison and James Tiptree, Jr. were frequent contributors in the 1970s, Tiptree contributing some of her best-known stories, such as &quot;And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill&#x27;s Side&quot; and &quot;The Women Men Don&#x27;t See&quot;; Ellison&#x27;s many stories in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; included &quot;The Deathbird&quot;, in 1973, which won a Hugo Award, and &quot;Jeffty Is Five&quot; in 1977, which won both a Hugo and a Nebula Award. Other award-winning stories from Ferman&#x27;s first decade and a half included Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;Ship of Shadows&quot; in 1969, &quot;Ill Met in Lankhmar&quot; in 1970, and &quot;Catch That Zeppelin&quot; in 1975; all three won Hugos, and the latter two also won Nebulas. Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Air and Darkness&quot; won both a Hugo and a Nebula, Robert Silverberg&#x27;s &quot;Born with the Dead&quot; won a Nebula, and Frederik Pohl&#x27;s novel of Martian colonization, &quot;Man Plus&quot;, also won a Nebula.

Judith Merril took over the book review column on Davidson&#x27;s departure, and was followed by James Blish in 1970 and Algis Budrys in 1975, with frequent contributions from other reviewers such as Joanna Russ and Gahan Wilson. In 1965 Wilson began contributing cartoons, and continued to do so regularly until 1981. Ferman set a humorous competition for the readers in the November 1971 issue, and thereafter ran two or three similar competitions every year. These were later collected in a 1996 anthology, titled &quot;Oi, Robot&quot;, the title taken from a competition to add a single letter to a well-known work of SF. A film review column, the first in the magazine since Charles Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;The Science Screen&quot; (and &quot;William Morrison&quot; aka Joseph Samachson&#x27;s live-theater column &quot;The Science Stage&quot;) in the latter 1950s, conducted by Samuel R. Delany, commenced in 1969; Baird Searles contributed the column between 1970 and 1984. Among the later reviewers, Ellison was one of the most popular, and columns from his first four years were collected as &quot;Harlan Ellison&#x27;s Watching&quot; in 1989.

&quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; was launched in 1977 and from 1983, under the editorships of Shawna McCarthy and later Gardner Dozois, it began to publish more mature material, becoming a more direct competitor to &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;″s market niche. Authors such as Lucius Shepard, James Blaylock, and John Crowley, whose work was a natural fit for &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, were selling to &quot;Asimov&quot;″s as well. The launch of &quot;Omni&quot; in 1978 also had an impact. For almost every year in the 1970s stories published in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; won more award nominations, and were selected for more &quot;Year&#x27;s Best&quot; anthologies, than the other magazines; in the 1980s that was no longer true, as &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; took over the leading role, and &quot;Omni&quot; sometimes pushed &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; into third place. Ferman was still able to acquire some highly regarded material, such as &quot;Lost Boys&quot; by Orson Scott Card, and &quot;Kirinyaga&quot; by Mike Resnick. When &quot;Omni&quot; rejected George R.R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Treatment&quot; and Gardner Dozois&#x27;s &quot;Down Among the Dead Men&quot;, which were dark fantasy, Ferman acquired both. Along with these regular columns, Ferman occasionally published articles, such as &quot;Science Fiction and the University&quot;, a feature in the May 1972 issue that included contributions from Darko Suvin, Thomas Clareson, and Philip Klass.

&quot;F&amp;SF&quot; won the Hugo Award for Best Magazine for four consecutive years, from 1969 through 1972, when the award was changed to &quot;Best Professional Editor&quot;. Initially this category was dominated by Ben Bova, the editor of &quot;Analog&quot;, but Ferman won it for three more years at the start of the 1980s.

Some of the artists who had provided covers for early issues of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, including Chesley Bonestell, Ed Emshwiller, and Alex Schomburg, were still contributing their work into the late 1970s, and many of the regular writers from the early years, such as Reginald Bretnor, Ron Goulart, and Hilbert Schenck, continued to appear in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; into the 1980s. A newer group, including Joanna Russ and R.A. Lafferty, had become regulars more recently. Some established writers such as Thomas Disch published their more unusual work in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, and there were also writers such as Felix C. Gotschalk, whose unusual stories were described by Ferman as &quot;a step ahead of most sf writers (or perhaps he&#x27;s marching in a different direction)&quot;. In Ashley&#x27;s opinion, Ferman managed to &quot;balance the work of these eccentric writers so that they never distorted the contents yet kept the magazine on the edge&quot;.

Newer writers who began to appear regularly in the 1980s included Bruce Sterling, who published his early Shaper/Mechanist stories in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, beginning with &quot;Swarm&quot;, in 1982. Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series had begun in 1979 in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, and four more stories appeared over the next three years before being collected as a novel in 1982; and Michael Shea and Bob Leman contributed horror and weird fiction regularly in the 1980s. Despite the increased competition from &quot;Omni&quot; and &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;, Ferman managed to keep &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;″s reputation for quality intact throughout the 1980s; it was not as distinct from its competition as it had once been, but it retained an &quot;idiosyncratic individuality&quot;, in Ashley&#x27;s words.

=== After Ferman ===
Under Kristine Kathryn Rusch &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; began to publish more dark fantasy and horror stories, such as &quot;The Night We Buried Road Dog&quot; by Jack Cady, which won a Nebula Award. When Rusch took over as editor, Isaac Asimov had been writing the science column for over three decades, and Algis Budrys had been contributing a book review column since 1975; in 1992 Asimov died and Budrys departed. The science column ran for 399 consecutive issues, ending in February 1992. Asimov&#x27;s widow, Janet Asimov, wrote another essay for the December 1994 issue, based on her conversations with her husband before his death, and a final essay appeared in January 1996, containing material from the book &quot;Yours, Isaac Asimov: A Lifetime of Letters&quot;. The science column continued to appear, written by Bruce Sterling and Gregory Benford among others, and John Kessel took over the book reviews; Robert Killheffer succeeded Kessel, with some overlap in 1994 and 1995. &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; maintained its dominance of the field through the 1990s, though Rusch published well-received material such as &quot;The Martian Child&quot; by David Gerrold and &quot;Last Summer at Mars Hill&quot; by Elizabeth Hand. Rusch won one Hugo Award as editor during her five years at &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, in 1994.

Van Gelder printed more fantasy and less hard science fiction than had Rusch, and in Ashley&#x27;s opinion he was able to &quot;restore some of the magazine&#x27;s distinctiveness&quot;. As a result of the switch to bimonthly in 2009, with the resulting higher page count in each issue, the magazine began to publish longer stories.

=== Assessment ===
&quot;F&amp;SF&quot; quickly established itself as one of the leading magazines. Ashley describes it as bridging &quot;the attitude gap between the slick magazines and the pulps&quot;&#x27;, and argues that it made the genre more respectable. The fantasy side of the magazine attracted writers who had been regular contributors to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and &quot;Unknown&quot;, two of the best-known fantasy pulps, and in Ashley&#x27;s opinion, it soon found a &quot;middle ground&quot; between those pulp traditions and fantasy written for the slicks. It was known as the most literary of the science fiction and fantasy magazines, and it published the most diverse range of material. In a 1978 review of New Wave SF, Christopher Priest agreed that &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; has a bias for literary work, and added that &quot;it has been a sort of New Wave of its own ever since its inception&quot;.

From the 1950s, &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; was regarded as one of the &quot;big three&quot; science fiction magazines, along with &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;. In a review of a 1952 issue, James Blish (writing as William Atheling, Jr.) commented that much of the magazine to that point was wonderfully written, and that Boucher&#x27;s and McComas&#x27;s editorial acumen made &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; very readable, but that on occasion a well-written, sophisticated, but unoriginal science fiction story might be accepted by &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; because it was not a specialist sf magazine. At the end of the 1950s Kingsley Amis described it as &quot;the most highbrow&quot; of the science fiction magazines, and Gary K. Wolfe later said that &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, along with &quot;Galaxy&quot;, &quot;defined the tenor&quot; of the 1950s. In 1966, Judith Merril argued that it was Boucher and McComas who made a place in the genre for writers such as Charles Beaumont, Mildred Clingerman, Edgar Pangborn, and many others who, in her opinion, had &quot;virtually stopped writing until the necessary new magazine came along&quot;.

In 2007, Ashley commented that &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; had been &quot;the most consistently enjoyable magazine of the last 50 years&quot;. In his view, a key reason for the magazine&#x27;s appeal was that its roots were in the literary tradition, with Lawrence Spivak, its first publisher, the inheritor of H.L. Mencken&#x27;s &quot;American Mercury&quot;, which had been successful and widely respected as a literary review. Unlike most of its competitors, &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; had no connection to the pulp magazine era, and its editors had always intended to appeal to readers of books, rather than of magazines. Ashley also cites &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;″s broad editorial policy, which allowed the magazine to carry a wider range of fiction than its competitors. In 2014 Gary Westfahl praised the &quot;creative editors of the 1980s and 1990s, such as Gardner Dozois ... and Gordon Van Gelder&quot;, but added that &quot;such editors were no longer the most important figures in the field&quot;.

The first issue was titled &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy&quot;; with the second issue the title switched to &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. It has been in digest format since the beginning.

The publisher was initially Fantasy House, a subsidiary of Mercury Press; from March 1958 the publisher was listed as Mercury Press instead. Since February 2001 the publisher has been Van Gelder&#x27;s Spilogale, Inc.

The following table lists &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;″s prices over the years. When Joseph Ferman announced the price change in the February 1959 issue, his justification for the increase was that &quot;during the past ten years...paper costs have gone up by 38%, composition, printing, binding and handling costs have gone up by 32%, postages costs have gone up from 33% to 60%, and various other costs have risen as much or more&quot;.
=== Anthologies ===
The following anthologies of fiction from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; have appeared.

In 1981, Martin H. Greenberg edited a hardcover facsimile edition of the April 1965 issue of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, with the addition of an introduction by Edward Ferman, and memoirs by the authors whose work appeared in the issue. The book was published by Southern Illinois University Press.

=== Overseas editions ===
&quot;F&amp;SF&quot; has had multiple foreign editions, including:
* Argentina. &quot;Minotauro&quot; (September 1964 – June 1968), edited by Francisco Porrúa under the alias Ricardo Gosseyn, and published by Ediciones Minotauro, Buenos Aires. Ten issues. The full title was &quot;Minotauro fantasía y ciencia-ficción&quot;. &quot;Minotauro&quot; did not reprint individual issues of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;; instead each issue was filled with stories selected from various issues of &quot;F&amp;SF.&quot; Also &quot;La revista de ciencia ficción y fantasía&quot; (October 1976 – February 1977), edited by Marcial Souto and published by Ediciones Orión. Three issues. This was primarily a reprint edition of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; but also published some original material.
* Australia. &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; (November 1954 – August 1958), published by Consolidated Press as a saddle-stapled digest. 14 issues. The first six issues were 128 pages long, the next 4 were 112 pages, and the last four were 96 pages. It was priced at 2/- throughout. The contents were selected from the US magazine but the Australian issues did not correspond to individual issues of the original.
* Brazil. &quot;Galáxia 2000&quot; (first issue January 1968), edited by Mario Camarinha, and published by Ediçōes O Cruzeiro. Four or five issues. This contains reprints from not only the US edition of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, but also from the French, Italian and Argentinian versions. This was followed in 1970 by another &quot;Magazine de Ficçāo Cientifica&quot;, which appeared in April 1970. The editor was initially Jerônymo Monteiro; he died after two issues and was succeeded by his daughter, Theresa Monteiro. The publisher was Revista do Globo. The magazine ran from April 1970 to November 1971, publishing a total of 20 issues, each containing a story by a local writer along with the reprinted material.
* France. &quot;Fiction&quot; (October 1953 – February 1990), edited by Alain Dorémieux for most of its existence. 412 issues. &quot;Fiction&quot; included original French stories as well as translations from the English version of the magazine, and occasionally these French stories subsequently appeared in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, translated into English. One example is &quot;Les Premiers jour de mai&quot; by Claude Veillot, which appeared in &quot;Fiction&quot; in May 1960 and then as &quot;The First Days of May&quot; in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; in December 1961, translated by Damon Knight. Since 2005 it has been issued twice a year as a magazine/anthology series.
* Germany. A series of anthologies titled &quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; began appearing in Germany in 1963, published by Heyne, and lasted until issue 101, which appeared in 2000. These contained stories selected from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;. The editor was Charlotte Winheller for issues 1–9; Walter Ernsting for issues 10–14; Wulf H. Bergner for issues 15–42; Manfred Kluge for issues 43–63; and thereafter. The full title of the publication was initially &quot;Eine Auswahl der besten SF-Stories aus &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;&quot;; later titles include &quot;Die besten SF-Stories aus &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;&quot; and &quot;Die besten Stories aus &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;&quot;.
* Israel&quot;. Fantasia 2000&quot; (December 1978 – 1984), edited by Aharon Hauptman and Gabi Peleg; published by A. Tene for the first 15 issues, and thereafter by Hyperion. 44 issues. Most of &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;″s contents were translations of material that had originally appeared in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, along with some original stories by Israelis. It included translations of Asimov&#x27;s science column, and also included departments that did not originate in &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, such as a letters page and non-fiction articles.
* Italy. &quot;Fantascienza&quot; (November 1954 – May 1955), edited by Livio Garzanti, published by Garzanti e i Fratelli Treves. 7 issues. Reprints of issues of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;. Also &quot;Fantasia &amp; Fantascienza&quot; (December 1962 – October 1963), edited by G. Jori, published by Minerva Editrice. 10 monthly issues, omitting May 1963. A reprint of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, but it included some original material as well. Another series of reprints was published by Elara from 2013 to 2017, for a total of 17 issues with irregular periodicity.
* Japan. &quot;SF Magazine&quot; (February 1960 – current as of 2017), edited by (among others) Masami Fukushima, Ryozo Nagashima, and Imaoka Kiyoshi. This began as a reprint edition of &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, but soon began printing more original fiction, and as of 2016 is the leading Japanese science fiction magazine, publishing both original material and stories reprinted from a variety of sources.
* Mexico. &quot;Ciencia y Fantasía&quot; (September 1955 – December 1957), editor unknown, published by Novaro-México, S.A. 14 issues. Reprinted from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot; by selecting stories from different issues of the original magazine.
* Norway. &quot;Nova&quot; (1971–1979), edited by Terje Wanberg, Øyvind Myhre, Per G. Olson, and Johannes H. Berg, published by Stowa Forlag. 34 issues. Initially titled &quot;Science Fiction-Magasinet&quot;, it began by reprinting from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;; from the fourth issue it began to feature new material.
* Sweden. &quot;Jules Verne Magasinet&quot; (1969–2013), edited and published by Bertil Falk (1969–1971); edited by Sam Lundwall (1972–2013) and published by Askild &amp; Kärnekull (1972), Delta (1973–1983), and Sam J Lundwall Fakta &amp; Fantasi (1983–2010). Starting with the Askild &amp; Kärnekull issues, and until at least the mid-1980s, this contained a large proportion of reprints from &quot;F&amp;SF&quot;, along with some original material from other sources.
* United Kingdom. Two series, both titled &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. The first series was published by Mellifont Press, and ran from October 1953 to September 1954, in digest format, with 128 pages, priced at 1/6. The contents were taken from the U.S. magazine, but the UK issues did not directly correspond to individual U.S. issues. The second series was published by Atlas Publishing &amp; Distributing from December 1959 to June 1964, in digest format. All issues were 128 pages except for January 1961 through November 1961 and March 1962 through June 1964, which were 112 pages. The price was 2/- from until November 1961, and 2/6 from December 1961 until the end of the run. As with the first series the reprint issues did not exactly correspond to individual U.S. issues. After the second series ended, some additional material from the U.S. issues was reprinted in the UK edition of &quot;Venture Science Fiction&quot;.

<text>The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) is a large Australian predatory freshwater fish of the genus &quot;Maccullochella&quot; in the family Percichthyidae. Although the species is called a cod in the vernacular, it is not related to the Northern Hemisphere marine cod (&quot;Gadus&quot;) species. The Murray cod is an important part of Australia&#x27;s vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia&#x27;s human culture. The Murray cod is the largest exclusively freshwater fish in Australia, and one of the largest in the world. Other common names for Murray cod include cod, greenfish, goodoo, Mary River cod, Murray perch, ponde, pondi and Queensland freshwater cod.

The scientific name of Murray cod derives from an early Australian fish researcher Allan Riverstone McCulloch and the river from which the explorer Major Mitchell first scientifically described the species, the Peel River. This was for a number of years changed to &quot;M. peelii peelii&quot; to differentiate Murray cod from Mary River cod, which were designated as a subspecies of Murray cod. However, as of 2010, Mary River cod have been raised to full species status (&quot;M. mariensis&quot;), thus Murray cod have reverted simply to &quot;M. peelii&quot;.

Murray cod populations have declined severely since European colonisation of Australia due to a number of causes, including severe overfishing, river regulation, and habitat degradation and are now a listed threatened species. However, they once inhabited almost the entire Murray-Darling basin, Australia&#x27;s largest river system, in very great numbers.

A long-lived fish, adult Murray cod are carnivorous and eat crustaceans (shrimp, yabbies, crays), fish and freshwater mussels. The species exhibits a high degree of parental care for their eggs, which are spawned in the spring and are generally laid in hollow logs or on other hard surfaces. Murray cod are a popular angling target and aquaculture species. Often available through the aquarium trade, they are also a popular aquarium species in Australia.
==Description==

The Murray cod is a large grouper-like fish with a deep, elongated body that is round in cross section. It has a broad, scooped head, and a large mouth lined with pads of very small, needle-like teeth. The jaws of the Murray cod are equal, or the lower jaw protrudes slightly.

The spiny dorsal fin of Murray cod is moderate to low in height and is partially separated by a notch from the high, rounded soft dorsal fin. Soft dorsal, anal, and caudal (tail) fins are all large and rounded, and are dusky grey or black with distinct white edges. The large, rounded pectoral fins are usually similar in colour to the flanks. The pelvic fins are large, angular, and set forward of the pectoral fins. The leading white-coloured rays on the pelvic fins split into two trailing white filaments, while the pelvic fins themselves are usually a translucent white or cream, tending toward opacity in large fish.

Murray cod are white to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but occasionally brown or black, mottling. The effect is a marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard&#x27;s markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.

===Size===
Murray cod are large fish, with adult fish regularly reaching in length. Murray cod are capable of growing well over in length and the largest on record was over and about in weight. Large breeding fish are rare in most wild populations today due to overfishing.

==Related species==

Murray cod continue a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species: Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species. The pattern is slightly blurred in the cod species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout cod stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, which can be extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic pattern of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present.

Murray cod, like a number of other Murray-Darling native fish species, have also managed to cross the Great Dividing Range at least once through natural river capture events, leading to several species and subspecies of coastal cod. The best known are eastern freshwater cod of the Clarence River system in northern New South Wales, and Mary River cod of the Mary River system in south eastern Queensland, both of which are endangered, but survive today. Coastal cod were also found in the Richmond River system in northern New South Wales and the Brisbane River system in southern Queensland, but are now extinct.

==Taxonomy==
In Mitchell&#x27;s original description, he classified the fish as &quot;Family, Percidae; Genus, Acerina; Subgenus, Gristes, Cuv. or Growler; Species, Gristes peelii mihi, or Cod-perch&quot;, observing &quot;This fish may be identical with the fish described by MM. Cuvier and Valenciennes Volume 3 page 45 under the name of Gristes macquariensis: but it differs from their description…&quot;.

In the 1800s and early 1900s, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, riverside residents, and some fisheries scientists (e.g. Anderson, Stead, Langtry) distinctly recognised two species of cod in the southern Murray-Darling basin, Murray cod and trout cod or &quot;blue nose cod&quot;. Taxonomically however, confusion abounded. Ignoring glaring differences in size at sexual maturity, and via some rather unscientific reasoning, some prominent fisheries scientists (e.g. Whitley) insisted on recognising only one species of cod—the Murray cod (then named &quot;Maccullochella macquariensis&quot;, after an early Australian fish researcher with the surname McCulloch and the Macquarie River in New South Wales where the holotype was captured). Then, as trout cod declined into near extinction over the 1900s, the distinction between the two species was further eroded and finally questioned. In the 1970s, early genetic techniques confirmed that trout cod were a separate species and further showed that the original &quot;Murray cod&quot; specimen was in fact a trout cod. Following the rules of scientific classification, the name &quot;M. macquariensis&quot; remained with the original specimen, now known to be the trout cod, and a new name, &quot;M. peelii&quot;, for the Peel River where the new holotype was captured, was coined for the Murray cod. Subsequently, two further cod were identified as separate species, the eastern freshwater cod (&quot;M. ikei&quot;) and the Mary River cod (&quot;M. mariensis&quot;).

==Range==
The Murray cod is named after the Murray River, part of the Murray-Darling basin in eastern Australia, Australia&#x27;s largest and most important river system, draining around 14% of the continent. The Murray cod&#x27;s natural range encompasses virtually the whole Murray-Darling basin, particularly the lowland areas, and extending well into upland areas — to about elevation in the southern half of the basin and to about in the northern half of the basin.

Consequently, Murray cod inhabit a remarkably wide variety of habitats, from cool, clear, fast-flowing streams with riffle-and-pool structure and rocky substrates in upland areas to large, slow flowing, meandering rivers in the extensive alluvial lowland reaches of the Murray-Darling basin.

Murray cod have died out in many of their upland habitats, particularly in the southern Murray-Darling basin, due to a combination of overfishing, siltation, dams and weirs blocking migration, pollution from arsenic-based sheep-dips, mining, and in some cases, introduced trout stockings, which causes competition between juvenile Murray cod and introduced trout species.

Murray Cod have also been introduced into other drainage basins, such as the Cooper Basin in Queensland.

==Age==
Murray cod are very long-lived, which is characteristic of many freshwater native fish in Australia. Longevity is a survival strategy in variable Australian environment to ensure that most adults participate in at least one exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet La Niña years and may only occur every one or two decades. Murray cod are the most long-lived freshwater native fish in Australia. The oldest Murray cod aged yet was 48 years of age, and the even larger specimens of years past leave little doubt that the species can reach considerably greater ages, of 70 years or more.

==Diet==
The Murray cod is the apex aquatic predator in the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin, and will eat almost anything smaller than itself, including finned fishes such as smaller Murray cod, golden perch, silver perch, bony bream, eel-tailed catfish, western carp gudgeon, and Australian smelt and introduced fish such as carp, goldfish, and redfin (English perch), as well as crustaceans such as yabbies, freshwater shrimp, and Murray crayfish. Fish are eaten when abundant by mature Murray cod in lowland river and impoundment habitats but crustaceans tend to dominate the diet under natural conditions, and freshwater mussels were commonly eaten in the past. Murray cod have also been known to eat ducks, cormorants, freshwater turtles, water dragons, snakes, mice, and frogs. The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct. While this behaviour is typical during the day, at night, Murray cod are active pelagic predators, venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface.

==Reproduction==

Murray cod reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age, generally five years. Sexual maturity in Murray cod is dependent on age. Therefore, roughly 70% of wild river Murray cod, with their slower growth rate, have reached sexual maturity by in length. Wild Murray cod in impoundments like Lake Mulwala, with their faster growth rates, do not reach sexual maturity until they are well over in length. These data strongly indicate the 50-cm (20-in) size limit for Murray cod is inadequate and should be increased substantially to allow for a greater chance of reproduction before capture.

Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are the most important breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also important because they produce larger larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass on. All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish. Not surprisingly, there is no truth to claim made by some recreational fishers that &quot;large Murray cod don&#x27;t breed&quot;.

Female Murray cod, upon first reaching sexual maturity, have egg counts of no more than 10,000. Very large female Murray cod can have egg counts as high as 80,000–90,000, although a recent, very large 33-kg specimen yielded an egg count of 110,000 viable eggs. Egg counts in female Murray cod of all sizes are relatively low compared to many fish species.

Murray cod spawn in spring, cued by rising water temperatures and increasing photoperiod (daylight length). Initially, fish biologists working with Murray cod considered spring floods and temperatures of to be necessary and that spring flooding is critical for successful recruitment (i.e. survival to juvenile stages) of young cod by providing an influx of pelagic zooplankton and early life-stage macroinvertebrates off the flood plain into the main river channel for first feeding, but more recent research has shown Murray cod breed annually, with or without spring floods, and at temperatures as low as . Additionally, recent research has shown abundant epibenthic/epiphytic (bottom dwelling/edge clinging) prey in unflooded lowland rivers, traits in Murray cod larvae that should allow survival in a variety of challenging conditions, and a significant proportion of Murray cod larvae feeding successfully in unflooded rivers.

Latest research has also shown that Murray cod in fact live their entire lifecycle within the main channel of the stream. Earlier ideas that Murray cod spawn on floodplains, or the larvae feed on floodplains, are incorrect. Murray cod breed in the main river channel or, in times of spring flood, the inundated upper portion of the main channel and tributary channels, but not on floodplains. Murray cod larvae feed within the main river channel or, in times of spring flood, on the inundated upper portion of the main channel and the channel/floodplain boundary, but not on the floodplain.

Spawning is sometimes preceded by upstream or downstream movements. Radio-tracked Murray cod in the Murray River have moved up to upstream to spawn, before returning to exactly the same snag from where they departed, an unusual homing behaviour in a freshwater fish. Decades of observations by recreational and commercial fishermen suggest such spring spawning movements are common across the Murray cod&#x27;s geographical range. Spawning is initiated by pairing up and courtship rituals. During the courtship ritual a spawning site is selected and cleaned — hard surfaces such as rocks in upland rivers and impoundments, and logs and occasionally clay banks in lowland rivers, at a depth of , are selected. The female lays the large adhesive eggs as a mat on the spawning surface, which the male fertilises. The female then leaves the spawning site. The male remains to guard the eggs during incubation, which takes six to 10 days (depending on water temperature), and to guard the hatched larvae for a further week or so until they disperse. Larvae disperse from the nest site by drifting in river currents at night, and continue this behaviour around four to seven days. During this dispersal process, larvae simultaneously absorb the remainder of their yolk sac and begin to feed on small, early life-stage macroinvertebrates and epibenthic/epiphytic (bottom dwelling/edge clinging) microinvertebrates. It may be that Murray cod are the first freshwater fish identified as having long-term pair-bonding in its repertoire of mating strategies in the wild.

The relationship between river flows and Murray cod recruitment are more complex than first thought, and in less regulated rivers, Murray cod may be able to recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows. (Significant recruitment of Murray cod in low-flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven.) This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in the current state of Murray cod stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than first thought.

These findings do not mean that river regulation and water extraction have not had adverse effects on fish stocks. Rather, river regulation has been a major factor in the decline of Murray cod and other native fish. Thermal pollution is also a major problem, evidence indicates strong Murray cod recruitment events (which may be important for sustaining Murray cod populations over the long term) can result from spring flooding, and the health of Australian lowland river ecosystems generally rely on periodic spring flooding. Also, due to the regulation of most of the rivers in the Murray-Darling River system, mainly for irrigation purposes, only exceptional spring floods manage to &quot;break free&quot;. The long-term viability of wild Murray cod, other native fish species and river ecosystems, in the face of this fact, are of great concern.

===History===
Murray cod were originally the most common large native fish in the Murray-Darling basin. Contrary to some fishery department literature, the first serious declines in Murray cod were caused by overfishing. In the latter half of the 1800s and the early 1900s, Murray cod were caught in large numbers by both commercial and recreational fishermen. For example, one commercial fishing operation commenced on the Murray River near Echuca in 1855, targeting Murray cod over hundreds of kilometres of river, and yet within eight years, grave concerns over the sustainability of this operation, and complaints about the near-absence of Murray cod in their heavily fished grounds, were being raised in the main state newspaper, &quot;The Argus&quot;. Yet fishing effort continued to increase in the region, so in the late 1880s and early 1890s, between 40,000 and 150,000 kg of mostly Murray cod (between 7,500 and 27,000 fish, at an average weight of 5.5 kg) were caught near Echuca. Similarly, in 1883, more than 147,000 kg of Murray cod were sent to Melbourne from just one river town (Moama). By the 1920s Murray cod had been overfished to the point where large-scale commercial fishing operations were no longer feasible. Recreational fishermen took similarly excessive hauls during this era, using rods and reels, handlines, setlines, drum nets, gill nets, and even explosives, with hauls often either wasted or illegally sold. Perhaps this extreme overfishing and its impacts of wild Murray cod stocks is best summarised by a short article in the &quot;Register News&quot; (a South Australian newspaper) in 1929:

&quot;In [the last] 29 years 26,214,502 lbs (nearly 11,703 tons) [11,915,683 kg] of Murray cod has been eaten by the people of Melbourne. The Superintendent of Markets (Mr G. B. Minns) included these figures in a statement he made today pointing out that the supply was declining. In 1918, the peak year, was received at the market, but since 1921, when was sent to Melbourne, supply has decreased. Last year [1928] it was only .&quot;

Twenty years later, the aquatic ecologist J. O. Langtry criticised the heavy fishing pressure, in the form of both uncontrolled small-scale commercial fishing and rampant illegal fishing, which he found in all reaches of the Murray River he investigated 1949–1950.

A thorough reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports reveals that the history of wild Murray cod between the mid–1800s and the mid–1900s was one of citizen agitation, government inaction, and ongoing stock decline. For decades, riverside residents, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local fisheries inspectors, fish retailers, and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the declining Murray cod stocks, to be met in turn either with government denials, or conversely, with various ineffective inquiries into Murray cod stocks and fisheries, and various ineffective control measures. Debate about excessive fishing pressure, number of fishermen, number of nets, net mesh size, bag limits, minimum size limits and take of small cod, closed seasons and the taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring, and other sundry issues, continued without resolution. Fishing regulations were either not amended, or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored. Heavy commercial, recreational and illegal fishing pressure continued. The end result was a Murray cod population, initially abundant, continually fished down until in the early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation (listed below) emerged to drive the species even further into decline. All of these drivers of decline left this iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation. There are now concerns for the long-term survival of wild Murray cod populations.

===Status===

Since 3 July 2003 and , the Murray cod is listed as a vulnerable species under the EPBC Act (&quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;). It is listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, but under state legislation in both South Australia and Victoria, it is an endangered species.

A study published in &quot;Biological Conservation&quot; in March 2023 listed 23 species which the authors considered to no longer meet the criteria as threatened species under the EPBC Act, including the Murray cod. The team, led by John Woinarski of Charles Darwin University looked at all species listed as threatened under the act in 2000 and 2022. The Murray cod was the only fish on the list, and the reason for their assessment was given as &quot;Actual recovery over the period 2000–2022, from long period of decline&quot;.

===Threats===
====Overfishing====
While extremely severe commercial and recreational overfishing in the 1800s and the early 1900s caused the first strong declines of Murray cod, overfishing by recreational fishermen, aided by inadequate fishing regulations, continues today and remains an extremely serious threat to Murray cod. The current size limit of 60 centimetres in most states is inadequate now that scientific studies have documented average size at sexual maturity in Murray cod. This and catch data and computer modelling exercises on wild Murray cod stocks indicate measures such as raising the size limit to 70 centimetres and reducing the bag and possession limits from 2 and 4 fish respectively to 1 fish are urgently needed to maintain the long-term viability of wild Murray cod populations. As of November 2014, the NSW Department of Fisheries has introduced a maximum size limit of 75 cm for Murray Cod to provide protection for large breeding fish, as well as a new minimum size limit of 55 cm.

Although angler effects are sometimes disregarded in the overall picture today, recent population studies have shown that while all year classes are well represented up to the minimum legal angling size (now 60 centimetres in most states), above that size, numbers of fish are dramatically reduced almost to the point of non-existence in many waters. Some emphasis has been made of the results of two small surveys which suggested a majority of Murray cod are released by anglers. However, there are valid questions as to the representativeness of these surveys: these surveys do not explain the dramatic disappearance of large numbers of young Murray cod at exactly the minimum size limit, and most importantly, any emphasis on these surveys miss the fundamental point — as a large, long-lived species with relatively low fecundity and delayed sexual maturity wild Murray cod populations are extremely vulnerable to overfishing, even with only modest angler-kill. A tightening of fishing regulations for wild Murray cod, as referred to above, and a switch by fishermen to a largely catch and release approach for wild Murray cod would alleviate this problem. Recognising these issues, in late 2014 the New South Wales and Victorian fishery departments amended their regulations so that a slot limit of 55 to 75 cm now applies in these states. (i.e. only Murray cod between 55 and 75 cm may be taken; those above and below this size range or &quot;slot&quot; must be released.) This measure should have positive effects for the Murray cod population by protecting and increasing the proportion of large breeding Murray cod.

Another issue is that Murray cod caught and released in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared to some of the other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.

====Effects of river regulation====
The Murray River and southern tributaries originally displayed a pattern of high flows in winter, high flows and floods in spring, and low flows in summer and autumn. The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish was adapted to these natural flow patterns. River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural flow patterns, with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows in winter and spring. Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse have been completely eliminated.

It is estimated that flows at the river mouth by 1995 had declined to only 27% of natural outflows. The probability of the bottom end of the Murray experiencing drought-like flows had increased from 5% under natural conditions to 60% by 1995.

Thermal pollution is the artificial reduction in water temperatures, especially in summer and autumn, caused when frigid water is released from the bottom of reservoirs for irrigation demands. Such temperature suppression typically extends several hundred kilometres downstream. Thermal pollution inhibits both the breeding of Murray cod and the survival of Murray cod larvae, and in extreme cases inhibits even the survival of adult Murray cod.

The rare floods that do break free of the dams and weirs of the Murray-Darling system have their magnitude and duration deliberately curtailed by river regulators. Increasing research indicates this management practice is very harmful and drastically reduces the general ecosystem benefits and breeding and recruitment opportunities for Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish species these now rare floods can provide.

====Blackwater events====
Blackwater events are emerging as a very serious threat to wild Murray cod stocks in lowland river reaches. Blackwater events occur when floodplains and ephemeral channels accumulate large quantities of leaf litter over a number of years and are then finally inundated in a flood event. The leaf litter releases large quantities of dissolved organic carbon, turning the water a characteristic black colour and inducing a temporary explosion in bacterial numbers and activity, which in turn consume dissolved oxygen, reducing them to levels harmful or fatal to fish. (Fish essentially asphyxiate.) Water temperature is a critical regulator of blackwater events as warmer water temperatures increase bacterial activity and markedly reduce the intrinsic oxygen carrying capacity of water; events that may be tolerable for fish in winter or early spring may be catastrophic in late spring or summer due to the increase in water temperature.

Blackwater events are often described as &quot;natural&quot; events—while there are some historical records of relatively severe events in smaller, more ephemeral systems (e.g. lower Lachlan, upper Darling), there is no record of severe events in the Murray River and its largest southern tributaries before water extraction and river regulation. In the Murray and large southern tributaries, very severe large-scale blackwater events are a relatively new but recurring phenomenon and appear to be an effect of river regulation curtailing the winter/spring flood events that formerly swept leaf litter away annually, exacerbated by long-term declines in rainfall and recurring prolonged drought events.

Flood events in 2010 and 2012 following the prolonged Millennium Drought (1997–2009) induced very severe blackwater events; while formal studies of these events were limited due to the relatively rapid response times required and logistical difficulties,
angler photographs and observations of extraordinary numbers of dead Murray cod during these events and plunging catch rates after these events show they induced extremely heavy Murray cod mortalities along extensive tracts of the Murray River.

====Physical barriers to fish movement====
Dams, weirs and other instream barriers block the migration of adult and juvenile Murray cod and prevent recolonisation of habitats and maintenance of isolated populations. Additionally, recent study has proven approximately 50% of Murray cod larvae are killed when they pass through undershot weirs.

====Habitat degradation / siltation====
Hundreds of thousands, perhaps more than a million, submerged timber &quot;snags&quot;, mainly River Red Gum, have been removed from lowland reaches of the Murray-Darling basin over the past 150 years. The removal of such a vast number of snags has had devastating impacts on Murray cod and river ecosystems. Snags are critical habitats and spawning sites for Murray cod. Snags are also critical for the functioning of lowland river ecosystems — as one of the few hard substrates in lowland river channels composed of fine silts snags are crucial sites for biofilm growth, macroinvertebrate grazing and general in-stream productivity.

Vegetation clearing and cattle trampling river banks create severe siltation, which fill in pools, degrade river ecosystems and make rivers and streams uninhabitable for Murray cod. This is exacerbated by removal of riparian (riverbank) vegetation which causes siltation and degrades river ecosystems in many ways.

====Introduced carp====
There is serious competition for food between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the sheer amount of biomass carp now take up, and the large numbers of larvae carp produce, causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced &quot;Lernaea&quot; parasite (&quot;Lernaea cyprinacea&quot;) and serious vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (&quot;Bothriocephalus acheilognathi&quot;).

====Introduced pathogens====
Murray cod have soft skin and very fine scales that leave them particularly vulnerable to infection from exotic diseases and parasites. The following exotic diseases and parasites all seriously affect wild Murray cod; all have been introduced by imports of exotic fish. &quot;Chilodonella&quot; is a single-celled, parasitic protozoa that infects the skin of Murray cod and has caused a number of serious kills of wild Murray cod. &quot;Saprolegnia&quot; is a fungus-like oomycete or &quot;water mould&quot; that frequently infects Murray cod eggs and the skin of Murray cod that have been roughly handled through poor catch and release technique. (It is essential that Murray cod intended for release only touch cool wet surfaces and are not put down on any hard, dry, rough or hot surfaces, e.g. boat gunwales, boat floors, dry grass, dry rocks, gravel banks, dry towels or mats, etc. Hands should also be wetted before touching them. They must not be hung vertically by the mouth or gill covers.) Wild Murray cod populations across their range suffer extremely severe infestations of &quot;Lernaea&quot; or &quot;anchor worm&quot;, a parasitic copepod vectored by introduced carp and that burrows into the skin of Murray cod. &quot;Lernaea&quot; puncture wounds are often secondarily infected by bacteria. Severe &quot;Lernaea&quot; infestations probably causes the death of many more adult Murray cod than commonly recognised. Ebner reports a young adult Murray cod seemingly killed by severe &quot;Lernaea&quot; infestation.

===Conservation measures===
State government fisheries departments support Murray cod populations by stocking with hatchery-bred fish, especially in man-made lakes. Important issues affecting restoration of cod populations, such as the need for spring floods and excessive angler take, are slowly being acknowledged but are yet to be definitely addressed. Other concerns such as the stocking of Murray cod in areas where trout cod (&quot;M. macquariensis&quot;) are recovering encourages hybridisation and needs consideration for future restocking programs.

==Relationship with humans==
Murray cod play a very important role in the mythology of many Aboriginal tribes in the Murray-Darling basin, and for some tribes, particularly those living along the Murray River, Murray cod were the icon species. The myths of these tribes describe the creation of the Murray River by a gigantic Murray cod fleeing down a small creek to escape from a renowned hunter. In these myths, the fleeing Murray cod enlarges the river and the beating of its tail create the bends in it. The cod is eventually speared near the terminus of the Murray River, chopped into pieces, and the pieces thrown back into the river. The pieces become all the other fish species of the river. The cod&#x27;s head is kept intact, told to &quot;keep being Murray cod&quot;, and also thrown back into the river.

Murray cod continue to play important roles in the culture of First Nations Peoples along the Murray and Darling rivers and the Murray-Darling Basin overall. 

== Aquaculture ==
The Murray cod is renowned as a good-tasting fish for eating. In recent years, despite the decline in the wild population, farmed fish are being harvested.

It has long been known that Murray cod could be translocated to impounded water. In the 1850s, landholder Terence Aubrey Murray stocked a large and beautiful billabong—Murray&#x27;s Lagoon just north of Lake George—with Murray cod fished out of the Molonglo River at Murray&#x27;s other property of Yarralumla. At some time the billabong overflowed and introduced Murray cod into the slightly brackish lake itself. They bred rapidly, and, from the 1850s to the 1890s, Lake George abounded with them. Due to the lengthy Federation Drought, by 1902, the lake dried out completely. In their search for water to survive in, the Murray cod flocked into the mouths of the few small creeks feeding the lake and died there by the thousands.

Farming Murray cod uses fishmeal and fish oil as food, but the species has a better ‘wild fish in to farmed fish out’ ratio than other farmed species such as rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon. It commands a premium price compared to those species. It is increasingly farmed, in large dams holding water used for irrigation of farmland, where the presence of effluent produced by the fish is not a problem

<doc id="405430" wikidata="Q730863" url="?curid=405430" title="Gynoid">
<text>A gynoid, or fembot, is a feminine humanoid robot. Gynoids appear widely in science fiction films and arts. As more realistic humanoid robot design becomes technologically possible, they are also emerging in real-life robot design. Just like any other robot, the main parts of a gynoid include sensors, actuators and a control system. Sensors are responsible for detecting the changes in the environment while the actuators, also called effectors, are motors and other components responsible for the movement and control of the robot. The control system instructs the robot on what to do so as to achieve the desired results.

==Name==
A gynoid is anything that resembles or pertains to the female human form. Though the term &quot;android&quot; has been used to refer to robotic humanoids regardless of apparent gender, the Greek prefix &quot;andr-&quot; refers to &quot;man&quot; in the masculine sense. 

The term &quot;gynoid&quot; was first used by Isaac Asimov in a 1979 editorial, as a theoretical female equivalent of the word &quot;android&quot;.

Other possible names for feminine robots exist. The portmanteau &quot;fembot&quot; (feminine robot) was used as far back as 1959, in Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;The Silver Eggheads&quot;, applying specifically to non-sentient female sexbots. It was popularized by the television series &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; in the episode &quot;Kill Oscar&quot; (1976) and later used in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; films, among others. &quot;Robotess&quot; is the oldest female-specific term, originating in 1921 from &quot;Rossum&#x27;s Universal Robots&quot;, the same source as the term &quot;robot&quot;.

==Feminine robots==
Examples of notable feminine robots include:

* EveR-1
* Actroid, designed by Hiroshi Ishiguro to be &quot;a perfect secretary who smiles and flutters her eyelids&quot;
* HRP-4C
* Meinü robot
* Ai-Da, the world&#x27;s first robot art system to be embodied as a humanoid robot. 
* Vyommitra (Sanskrit: , ) is a female humanoid robot designed for space travel. She was developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to function aboard the spacecraft &quot;Gaganyaan,&quot; a crewed orbital spacecraft. 

Researchers note the connection between the design of feminine robots and roboticists&#x27; assumptions about gendered appearance and labor. Fembots in Japan, for example, are designed with slenderness and grace in mind, and they are employed to help to maintain traditional family structures and politics in a nation of population decline.

People&#x27;s reactions to fembots are also attributable to gender stereotypes. Research in this area is aimed at elucidating gender cues, clarifying which behaviors and aesthetics elicit a stronger gender-induced response.

===Sexualization===


Gynoids may be &quot;eroticized&quot;, and some examples such as Aiko include sensitivity sensors in their breasts and genitals to facilitate sexual response. The fetishization of gynoids in real life has been attributed to male desires for custom-made passive women and compared to life-size sex dolls. However, some science fiction works depict them as femmes fatales, fighting the establishment or being rebellious.

In 1983, a female robot named &quot;Sweetheart&quot; was removed from a display at the Lawrence Hall of Science; the robot&#x27;s breasts, perceived as an exaggerated feature, resulted in a petition being presented claiming it was insulting to women. The robot&#x27;s creator, Clayton Bailey, a professor of art at California State University, Hayward called this &quot;censorship&quot; and &quot;next to book burning&quot;.

== In fiction ==

Artificial women have been a common trope in fiction and mythology since the writings of the ancient Greeks (see the myth of Pygmalion). In science fiction, female-appearance robots are often produced for use as domestic servants and sexual slaves, as seen in the film &quot;Westworld&quot;, in Paul J. McAuley&#x27;s novel &quot;Fairyland&quot; (1995), and in Lester del Rey&#x27;s short story &quot;Helen O&#x27;Loy&quot; (1938), and sometimes as warriors, killers, or laborers. The character of Annalee Call in &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; is a rare example of a non-sexualized gynoid. In &quot;Xenosaga&quot;, a role-playing video game, the character &quot;KOS-MOS&quot; is a female armored android.

===The perfect woman===

A long tradition exists in literature of the construction of an artificial embodiment of a certain type of ideal woman, and fictional gynoids have been seen as an extension of this theme. Examples include Hephaestus in the Iliad who created female servants of metal, and Ilmarinen in the Kalevala who created an artificial wife. Pygmalion, from Ovid&#x27;s account, is one of the earliest conceptualizations of constructions similar to gynoids in literary history. In this myth a female statue is sculpted that is so beautiful that the creator falls in love with it, and after praying to Aphrodite, the goddess takes pity on him and converts the statue into a real woman, Galatea, with whom Pygmalion has children.

The Maschinenmensch (&quot;machine-human&quot;), also called &quot;Parody,&quot; &quot;Futura,&quot; &quot;Robotrix,&quot; or the &quot;Maria impersonator,&quot; in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; is the first example of gynoid in film: a femininely shaped robot is given skin so that she is not known to be a robot and successfully impersonates the imprisoned Maria and works convincingly as an exotic dancer.

Fictional gynoids are often unique products made to fit a particular man&#x27;s desire, as seen in the novel &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Eve&quot; and films &quot;The Perfect Woman&quot;, &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;, &quot;Mannequin&quot; and &quot;Weird Science&quot;, and the creators are often male &quot;mad scientists&quot; such as the characters Rotwang in &quot;Metropolis&quot;, Tyrell in &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and the husbands in &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;. Gynoids have been described as the &quot;ultimate geek fantasy: a metal-and-plastic woman of your own.&quot;

&quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; television series popularized the word &quot;fembot&quot;. These fembots were a line of powerful, lifelike gynoids with the faces of protagonist Jaime Sommers&#x27;s best friends. They fought in two multi-part episodes of the series: &quot;Kill Oscar&quot; and &quot;Fembots in Las Vegas,&quot; and despite the feminine prefix, there were also male versions, including some designed to impersonate particular individuals for the purpose of infiltration. While not truly artificially intelligent, the fembots still had extremely sophisticated programming that allowed them to pass for human in most situations. The term &quot;fembot&quot; was also used in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

The 1987 science-fiction film &quot;Cherry 2000&quot; portrayed a gynoid character which was described by the male protagonist as his &quot;perfect partner&quot;. The 1964 TV series &quot;My Living Doll&quot; features a robot, portrayed by Julie Newmar, who is similarly described. The film &quot;Her&quot; (2013) depicts an Artificial Intelligence assistant called Samantha, whom the protagonist, Theodore, falls in love with until her intelligence surpasses human comprehension and she leaves to fulfil her higher purpose.

More recently, the 2015 science-fiction film &quot;Ex Machina&quot; featured a genius inventor experimenting with gynoids in an effort to create the perfect companion.

===Gender===
Fiction about gynoids or female cyborgs reinforce essentialist ideas of femininity, according to Margret Grebowicz. Such essentialist ideas may present as sexual or gender stereotypes. Among the few non-eroticized fictional gynoids include Rosie the Robot Maid from &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. However, she still has some stereotypical feminine qualities, such as a matronly shape and a predisposition to cry.
The stereotypical role of wifedom has also been explored through use of gynoids. In &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;, husbands are shown as desiring to restrict the independence of their wives, and obedient and stereotypical spouses are preferred. The husbands&#x27; technological method of obtaining this &quot;perfect wife&quot; is through the murder of their human wives and replacement with gynoid substitutes that are compliant and housework obsessed, resulting in a &quot;picture-postcard&quot; perfect suburban society. This has been seen as an allegory of male chauvinism of the period, by representing marriage as a master-slave relationship, and an attempt at raising feminist consciousness during the era of second wave feminism.

In a parody of the fembots from &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, attractive, blonde fembots in alluring baby-doll nightgowns were used as a lure for the fictional agent Austin Powers in the movie &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot;. The film&#x27;s sequels had cameo appearances of characters revealed as fembots.

Jack Halberstam writes that these gynoids inform the viewer that femaleness does not indicate naturalness, and their exaggerated femininity and sexuality is used in a similar way to the title character&#x27;s exaggerated masculinity, lampooning stereotypes.

===Sex objects===

Some argue that gynoids have often been portrayed as sexual objects. Female cyborgs have been similarly used in fiction, in which natural bodies are modified to become objects of fantasy. The female robot in visual media has been described as &quot;the most visible linkage of technology and sex&quot; by Steven Heller.

Feminist critic Patricia Melzer writes in &quot;Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought&quot; that gynoids in Richard Calder&#x27;s &quot;Dead Girls&quot; are inextricably linked to men&#x27;s lust, and are mainly designed as sex objects, having no use beyond &quot;pleasing men&#x27;s violent sexual desires.&quot;
The gynoid character Eve from the film &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; has been described as &quot;a literal sex bomb,&quot; with her subservience to patriarchal authority and a bomb in place of reproductive organs. In the 1949 film &quot;The Perfect Woman&quot;, the titular robot, Olga, is described as having &quot;no sex,&quot; but Steve Chibnall writes in his essay &quot;Alien Women&quot; in &quot;British Science Fiction Cinema&quot; that it is clear from her fetishistic underwear that she is produced as a toy for men, with an &quot;implicit fantasy of a fully compliant sex machine.&quot; In the film &quot;Westworld&quot;, female robots actually engaged in intercourse with human men as part of the make-believe vacation world human customers paid to attend.

Sexual interest in gynoids and fembots has been attributed to fetishisation of technology, and compared to sadomasochism in that it reorganizes the social risk of sex. The depiction of female robots minimizes the threat felt by men from female sexuality and allow the &quot;erasure of any social interference in the spectator&#x27;s erotic enjoyment of the image.&quot; Gynoid fantasies are produced and collected by online communities centered around chat rooms and web site galleries.

Isaac Asimov writes that his robots were generally sexually neutral and that giving the majority masculine names was not an attempt to comment on gender. He first wrote about female-appearing robots at the request of editor Judy-Lynn del Rey. Asimov&#x27;s short story &quot;Feminine Intuition&quot; (1969) is an early example that showed gynoids as being as capable and versatile as male robots, with no sexual connotations. Early models in &quot;Feminine Intuition&quot; were &quot;female caricatures,&quot; used to highlight their human creators&#x27; reactions to the idea of female robots. Later models lost obviously feminine features, but retained &quot;an air of femininity.&quot;

== Criticisms ==
Critics have commented on the problematic nature of assigning a gender to an artificial object with no consciousness of its own, based purely on its appearance or sound. It has also been argued that innovations should part from this essentialising notion of a woman and focus on the purpose of creating robots, without making them explicitly male or female. Very few robots are explicitly assigned the male gender, contributing to the male default narrative. Critics have also noticed how the creation of gynoids is associated with service roles, while androids or systems with male voices are employed in positions of leadership.

<text>Loíza () is a town and municipality on the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico, located east of Carolina, west of Río Grande, and north of Canóvanas. An outer municipality within the San Juan metropolitan area, it is spread over 5 barrios and the downtown area and administrative center of Loíza Pueblo. Loíza is renowned for its rich Afro-Puerto Rican culture and heritage. The vendors of Puerto Rican street food in kiosks, the unrestricted beaches, and the Australian pine and mangrove state forest in the district of &quot;Piñones&quot; in the barrio of Torrecilla Baja are popular destinations among domestic and foreign tourists. 

==History==
According to some sources, its name comes from a female cacique, named Loaíza or Yuíza, who governed the region formerly called Haimanio, on the shores of the Río Grande de Loíza. It is said that this cacique might have married a mulatto conquistador called Pedro Mejías, but there is no evidence of this. Other sources point to a Spanish landlord named Iñigo López de Cervantes y Loayza, who owned a lot of the territory, and was renowned among governors and colonists of the time.

In 1692, Loíza was officially declared an urban area due to its population (100 houses and 1,146 residents), but it was in 1719 that the Spanish government declared it as an official town. It was founded by Gaspar de Arredondo.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Loíza was 12,522.

In the 1970s, an Aero Virgin Islands DC-3 plane crashed in a Loíza beach, with no fatalities.

On September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Loíza, 598 residences lost their roof and 298 homes were a total loss. Loíza suffered a catastrophic hit from Hurricane Maria like the rest of Puerto Rico. In 2018, it was featured in an episode of &quot;Bar Rescue&quot; called &quot;Operation: Puerto Rico&quot; where bar consultant Jon Taffer visited Loíza to rescue an area bar and turned it into a community rescue, repairing a local community center, playground, baseball field and basketball court as well as the bar.

<doc id="405434" wikidata="Q736874" url="?curid=405434" title="Tárogató">
<text>The tárogató (&quot;töröksíp&quot;, &quot;Turkish pipe&quot;; plural &quot;tárogatók&quot; or, anglicized, &quot;tárogatós&quot;; or &quot;torogoata&quot;) is a woodwind instrument commonly used in Hungarian folk music. The modern tárogató was intended to be a recreation of the original tárogató, but the two instruments are thought to have little in common.

==History==
===Early use===

Mention of the tárogató in Hungarian writings dates back at least as long ago as the 15th century. It is not clear whether it was first brought into Europe by the Hungarians when they first emigrated from the east in the 9th century. It is certain, however, that instruments of this type, descended from the Middle Eastern zurna, were introduced into Eastern Europe by the Turks in the Middle Ages, as evidenced by the term töröksip—&quot;Turkish pipe&quot;—which was used as a synonym for tárogató. It is possible that instruments from both traditions were combined into one entity. The tárogató has a Turkish origin, and it appeared in Hungary during the Turkish wars. Up to about the 18th century, the tárogató was a type of shawm, with a double reed, conical bore, and no keys.

Being a very loud and raucous instrument, the tárogató was used as a signaling instrument in battle (like the bugle or the bagpipe). However, depending on the type of reed used, it can also give off a very subtle, and yet, deep, mellow sound when played at a relaxed, steady pace. Because the tárogató was representative of the Rákóczi&#x27;s War for Independence (1703–1711), its use was suppressed in the 18th century by the Habsburg monarchy. The instrument was eventually abandoned, being considered too overpowering for a concert hall.

===Modern usage===

In the 1890s, a modern version was invented by Vencel József Schunda, a Budapest instrument maker. It uses a single reed, like a clarinet or saxophone, and has a conical bore, similar to the saxophone. The instrument is made of wood, usually black grenadilla wood like a clarinet or oboe. The most common size, the soprano tárogató in B♭, is about 29 inches (74 cm) in length and has a mournful sound similar to a cross between an English horn and a soprano saxophone. Other sizes exist: one maker, János Stowasser, advertised a family of seven sizes of which the largest was a contrabass tárogató in E♭. The new tárogató bears very little resemblance with the historical tárogató and the two instruments should not be confused. It has been suggested that the name &quot;schundaphone&quot; would have been more accurate, but tárogató was used because of the nationalistic image that the original instrument had.

This instrument was a symbol of Hungarian aristocracy, and the favorite woodwind instrument of Governor Miklós Horthy. Manufacturing in Hungary ceased after World War II, though tárogatós continued to be made in Romania and other countries. In the 1990s several Hungarian makers started producing the instrument again.

A modern tárogató may occasionally be heard in Act 3 of Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner where it has become traditional in some opera houses (e.g. the Royal Opera House, London) to use it instead of the off-stage cor anglais for the last passage (bars 999-1149) of the Shepherd&#x27;s air, but Wagner did not specify this, merely suggesting in the score &quot;a specially built simple natural instrument&quot;.
In the 1920s, Luță Ioviță, who played the instrument in the army during World War I, brought it to Banat (Romania), where it became very popular under the name &quot;taragot&quot;. In 1928, the British music journal Melody Maker reported that the Oxford-based clarinettist Frank Dyer was using &quot;a taragossa, a novelty Hungarian instrument which is a cross between a saxophone and a Cor Anglais&quot; with his Symphonic Dance Orchestra. No such instrument as a &quot;taragossa&quot; exists: the rest of the journal&#x27;s description fits that of the tárogató.

Dumitru Fărcaș, who was born in Maramureș, made the instrument known all over the world and was considered to be the most famous tárogató player. German saxophonist Peter Brötzmann has used the tárogató in free jazz and free improvisation. American reed players Charles Lloyd, Scott Robinson &amp; Michael Marcus have occasionally used the tárogató. Joe Lovano has also displayed interest in the instrument featuring it extensively in his episode of &quot;&quot;, on Steve Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;Mostly Coltrane&quot;, and on his own albums &quot;Trio Tapestry&quot; and &quot;Roma&quot; (with Enrico Rava) (both ECM Records). In 2015, Irina Ross, a Romanian singer, released her single &quot;Taragot&quot; which features the instrument in a dance-pop song.

<text>The Italian National Institute of Statistics (; Istat) is the primary source of official statistics in Italy. The institute conducts a variety of activities, including the census of population, economic censuses, and numerous social, economic, and environmental surveys and analyses. Istat is the largest producer of statistical information in Italy and is actively involved in the European Statistical System, which is overseen by Eurostat. 

==History==
The Italian National Institute of Statistics () was established by Legislative decree no. 1162 on 9 July, 1926, as the Central Institute of Statistics () in order to replace the General Statistics Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Corrado Gini was established as the first director of the institute, under the authority of the head of state.

The institute, with a staff of about 170 workers, was charged with publishing the data of the 6th general population census, generated by updating the figures from previous censuses carried out by the General Statistics Division up until 1921. After ramping up activities in the early 1930s, national statistics operations in Italy suffered serious setbacks due to economic sanctions imposed as a result of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, which essentially halted any publication of economic or financial data. The figures that had been already collected but not reported during this period were eventually published in 1937, although this activity was ceased only two years afterwards.

After the outbreak of the Second World War, publications decreased due to the lack of personnel, most of whom had been called up for military service. This led to a postponement of the 9th population census, which was instead held in 1951. Due to the Armistice of Cassibile in 1943, the institute headquarters were relocated within the territory of the Italian Social Republic.

During the late 1940s, the archives were recovered and transferred back to Rome, allowing the institute to fully resume its activities. With post-war reconstruction underway, the institute mainly focused on collecting new data concerning national development that eventually lead to the publication of the volume &quot; (Studies on National Revenue) in 1950.

Legislative decree no. 322, published on 6 September, 1989, established the National Statistics System () and changed the name of the institution to the National Institute of Statistics (), without changing its acronym, which remained Istat.

Institute publications are released under a Creative Commons &quot;Attribution&quot; (CC BY) license.

== Organization ==
The administration of the institute is as follows:

* President, appointed by the President of Italy upon the proposal of the President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) after the approval of the Council of Ministers. Their term lasts for four years and can be renewed only once. They are responsible for the performance of the institute and its technical and scientific coordination.
* Policy-making and Statistics Information Coordination Committee, whose term lasts for four years, made up of 15 members including the president, carries out steering duties.
* Governing Board, which directs and oversees every activity carried out by the institute. The Governing Board consists of the President as well as of nine other members.
* Board of Auditors, which makes sure that account statements align with previous accounting records. Its term lasts for three years and consists of a member of the Council of State who serves as its president, as well as a representative from the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and one from the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

<text>Cyril Stanley Smith (4 October 1903 – 25 August 1992) was a British metallurgist and historian of science. He is most famous for his work on the Manhattan Project where he was responsible for the production of fissionable metals. A graduate of the University of Birmingham and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Smith worked for many years as a research metallurgist at the American Brass Company. During World War II he worked in the Chemical-Metallurgical Division of the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he purified, cast and shaped uranium-235 and plutonium, a metal hitherto available only in microgram amounts, and whose properties were largely unknown. After the war he served on the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s influential General Advisory Committee, and the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee.

Smith founded the Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago, the first interdisciplinary academic organization devoted to the study of metals in the United States. He studied the details of faults and grain boundaries in metals, and developed theoretical models of them. In 1961, he moved to MIT as an Institute Professor with appointments in both the Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. He applied the techniques of metallurgy to the study of the production methods used to create artefacts such as samurai swords.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Birmingham, England, on 4 October 1903, the third of four children of Joseph Seymour Smith, a commercial traveller for Camp Coffee, and his wife, Frances, née Norton. He was educated at Bishop Vesey&#x27;s Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. He read metallurgy at the University of Birmingham, having not met the requirements in mathematics to study his first choice, which was physics, and was awarded a second-class BSc in 1924.

That year Smith entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he earned a ScD in 1926. He was a research associate at MIT from 1926 to 1927, then left to take up a position as a research metallurgist at the American Brass Company. His research there was mainly involved with the electrical, thermal, and mechanical and magnetic properties of copper alloys. He published numerous papers, and was awarded 20 patents.

He married Alice Marchant Kimball, a student of English social history at Yale University, from which she earned a PhD in 1936, on 16 March 1931. Of the marriage, Alice&#x27;s sister remarked that: &quot;If he didn&#x27;t go to Oxford or Cambridge, isn&#x27;t Church of England, and doesn&#x27;t like sports, you might as well marry an American&quot;. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1939. His wife sparked an interest in history, a subject that he had disliked at school. He acquired old texts, and in 1945 he produced a translation of a classic metallurgical text, Vannocio Biringuccio&#x27;s &quot;De la pirotechnia&quot; (1540).

==World War II==

In 1942, during World War II, he was called into service at the War Metallurgy Committee in Washington, D.C. In April 1943 he went to work on the Manhattan Project, joining the Chemical-Metallurgical Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory as the head of its Metallurgy Group. When the laboratory was reorganized in April 1944, he became the Associate Division Leader in charge of metallurgy. His first task was recruiting metallurgists, who were in great demand by the war effort. He also had to arrange for the transport of their metallurgical equipment to Los Alamos under wartime conditions.

Smith&#x27;s metallurgists found ways of fabricating boron, producing beryllium bricks, and heat-treating steel. They also had to work with uranium. Frank Spedding had developed a large-scale process for producing pure uranium metal at the Ames Laboratory which was fine for producing tons of feed for the nuclear reactors, but enriched uranium could not be handled in this way, as it would form a critical mass. Smith was initially asked to produce cubes of uranium hydride, which he did, but the 1950s uranium hydride bomb tests were found to be inefficient, and the idea was set aside for the duration, although further work was carried out after the war. By July 1944, they were producing pure uranium metal in 200g amounts with a newly devised process.

But by far the biggest challenge for Smith and his group was plutonium, a metal hitherto available only in microgram amounts, and whose properties were largely unknown. It was initially assumed that plutonium would have properties similar to that of uranium, but this assumption turned out to be invalid. Plutonium proved to be &quot;the most complicated metal known to man&quot;. There were found to be six allotropes of plutonium, more than any other metal, and its melting point turned out to be hundreds of degrees lower than uranium. The metallurgists found that at around 125 °C, plutonium expanded in volume by 20 percent, which is unusual.

Plutonium was delivered to Los Alamos in the form of what was found to be a mixture of plutonium trifluoride (PuF3) and plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4). Work with plutonium was carried out in gloveboxes for safety reasons. The metallurgists figured out how to purify the plutonium, and found that heating it to 250° allowed them to work it in the malleable γ phase. It was also found that alloying it with 3 percent gallium would stabilize it in the δ phase. When plutonium at last began to arrive in quantity from the Hanford Site in February 1945, they were ready for production. In a race against the clock, the metallurgists produced plutonium spheres for the Trinity nuclear test by 23 July 1945.

Smith was awarded the Medal for Merit by President Harry S. Truman for these activities in 1946.

==University of Chicago==
After the war Smith founded the Institute for the Study of Metals at the University of Chicago, the first interdisciplinary academic organization devoted to the study of metals in the United States. He considered it &quot;a natural outgrowth of the close association of metallurgists with chemists and physicists on the Manhattan Project.&quot; He developed methods for deriving the three-dimensional shapes of the crystalline structures of metals from the two-dimensional microscope images of the grains of the metals. He also studied the propagation of induced phase changes in metals. He was fascinated by the details of faults and grain boundaries in metals, and developed theoretical models of them. Perhaps his most influential paper was on &quot;Grain Shapes and Other Metallurgical Applications of Topology&quot; (1952), an explanation of metallic microstructure. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1955 to study the History of Science and Technology.

From 12 December 1946 to 10 January 1952, Smith served on the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Chaired by Robert Oppenheimer, the wartime director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, the General Advisory Committee provided policy as well as technical advice to the commissioners. One of Smith&#x27;s first papers for the commission recommended that it concentrate on the development of fast breeder reactors and high flux reactors. A 1948 visit to England to discuss plutonium metallurgy with British scientists nearly escalated into an international incident, as Senator Bourke Hickenlooper and Secretary of Defense James Forrestal feared that he would give atomic secrets away to the British. Smith did no such thing; but AEC Commissioner Sumner Pike faced severe criticism for authorizing Smith&#x27;s visit. In common with other members of the General Advisory Committee, Smith opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb on technical and moral grounds. He also served on the National Academy of Sciences&#x27; Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy and the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee. Smith was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950, the American Philosophical Society in 1955, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1957.

==Massachusetts Institute of Technology==
In 1961, Smith moved to MIT as an Institute Professor with appointments in both the Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. His focus was to transplant the techniques of metallurgy into the study of the production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about this at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.

Smith received numerous awards, including the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Francis J. Clamer Medal in 1952, and the History of Science Society&#x27;s Pfizer Medal and American Society for Metals&#x27; Gold Medal in 1961. He was awarded the Society for the History of Technology&#x27;s Leonardo da Vinci Medal in 1966, and the Institute of Metals&#x27; Platinum Medal in 1970. 
In 1981, Cyril Stanley Smith received the Dexter Award for Outstanding Achievement in the History of Chemistry from the American Chemical Society.
In 1991 he received the American Institute of Physics&#x27; Andrew Gemant Award for &quot;pioneering the use of solid state physics in the study of ancient art and artefacts to reconstruct their cultural, historical and technological significance.&quot; He was also a member of the editorial board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

On retirement from MIT in 1969, Smith became a professor emeritus of the History of Science and Technology, professor emeritus of Metallurgy and Humanities and Institute Professor Emeritus, an unusual title &quot;reserved for only a few whose work transcends the boundaries of traditional departments and disciplines&quot;. He died of colonic cancer in his Cambridge, Massachusetts home on 25 August 1992. He was survived by his wife of sixty years, Alice Kimball Smith, his two children, Anne Smith Denman, chair of the Department of Anthropology at Central Washington University, and Stuart Marchant Smith, a marine geologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a sister, Mary Smith. His papers are in the Niels Bohr Library in College Park, Maryland. His collection of antiquarian metallurgical texts was left to the Burndy Library at the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology.

<text>PARRY was an early example of a chatbot, implemented in 1972 by psychiatrist Kenneth Colby.

==History==
PARRY was written in 1972 by psychiatrist Kenneth Colby, then at Stanford University. While ELIZA was a simulation of a Rogerian therapist, PARRY attempted to simulate a person with paranoid schizophrenia. The program implemented a crude model of the behavior of a person with paranoid schizophrenia based on concepts, conceptualizations, and beliefs (judgements about conceptualizations: accept, reject, neutral). It also embodied a conversational strategy, and as such was a much more serious and advanced program than ELIZA. It was described as &quot;ELIZA with attitude&quot;.

PARRY was tested in the early 1970s using a variation of the Turing Test. A group of experienced psychiatrists analysed a combination of real patients and computers running PARRY through teleprinters. Another group of 33 psychiatrists were shown transcripts of the conversations. The two groups were then asked to identify which of the &quot;patients&quot; were human and which were computer programs. The psychiatrists were able to make the correct identification only 48 percent of the time — a figure consistent with random guessing.

PARRY and ELIZA (also known as &quot;the Doctor&quot;) interacted several times. The most famous of these exchanges occurred at the ICCC 1972, where PARRY and ELIZA were hooked up over ARPANET and responded to each other.

<text>Neolithic tombs are structures built by humans during the New Stone Age. 

== Types ==
=== Northwestern Europe ===

The main types in Northwestern Europe, particularly Ireland, include passage graves, court cairn, and menhir.

All these types of tomb were built from large slabs of rock which were uncut or worked only slightly. In each case, there was a &quot;doorway&quot; made from two large stones facing each other.

The doorway led to an inner chamber, or a passage and chamber, lined with flat slabs. In all but the portal dolmens, the tomb was then covered in earth and small stones to make a mound.

=== Asia ===

The five types of neolithic tombs found in Korea include dolmen or menhir, cist, cairn, urn, and wooden chamber.

== Uses ==
While some of these stone structures did indeed have human remains contained within them, it is erroneous to suggest that they all were &quot;tombs&quot;. It is peculiar to note that after being in use for 3–4,000 years many of these contained no bones whatsoever. Some remains that were carbon dated showed that the interments were inserted hundreds of years after the megaliths were constructed. It would seem that when the original purpose of the &quot;passage tombs&quot; was abandoned, they were adapted for use as crypts by later generations.

== Preservation ==
In England and Ireland, many Neolithic tombs were unwittingly ruined as a result of excavation by antiquarians in the nineteenth century.

<doc id="405451" wikidata="Q7963016" url="?curid=405451" title="Walled village">
<text>A walled village () is a type of large traditional multi-family communal living structure found in China, that is designed to be easily defensible. It is completely surrounded by thick defensive walls, protecting the residents from the attack of wild animals and enemies. Usually, people living in the walled village are extended families or clans sharing the same surname. Walled villages are still found in southern China and Hong Kong.

==History==
During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the shore of Guangdong suffered from pirates. The area of Hong Kong was particular vulnerable to pirates&#x27; attacks. Winding shores, hilly lands and islands and far from administrative centres made Hong Kong an excellent hideout for pirates. Villages, both Punti and Hakka, built walls against pirates. Some villages even protected themselves using cannons. In Punti Cantonese, &quot;Wai&quot; (圍, Walled) and &quot;Tsuen&quot; (村, Village) were once synonyms.

==Ancestral halls==
The ancestral hall was the most important building in a village. It housed the soul tablets of the ancestors of the villagers and the villagers went there to worship. Ancestral halls were also used as schools.
