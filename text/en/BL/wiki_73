<text>[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] symbolism is the use of symbols (Sanskrit: &quot;pratīka&quot;) to represent certain aspects of the Buddha&#x27;s Dharma (teaching). Early Buddhist symbols which remain important today include the Dharma wheel, the Indian lotus, the three jewels and the Bodhi tree.

Buddhism symbolism is intended to represent the key values of the Buddhist faith. The popularity of certain symbols has grown and changed over time as a result of progression in the followers ideologies. Research has shown that the aesthetic perception of the Buddhist gesture symbol positively influenced perceived happiness and life satisfaction.

Anthropomorphic symbolism depicting the Buddha (as well as other figures) became very popular around the first century CE with the arts of Mathura and the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara. New symbols continued to develop into the medieval period, with Vajrayana Buddhism adopting further symbols such as the stylized double vajra. In the modern era, new symbols like the Buddhist flag were also adopted.

Many 
symbols are depicted in early Buddhist art. Many of these are ancient, pre-Buddhist and pan-Indian symbols of auspiciousness (mangala). According to Karlsson, Buddhists adopted these signs because &quot;they were meaningful, important and well-known to the majority of the people in India.&quot; They also may have had apotropaic uses, and thus they &quot;must have been a way for Buddhists to protect themselves, but also a way of popularizing and strengthening the Buddhist movement.&quot;

At its founding in 1952, the World Fellowship of Buddhists adopted two symbols to represent Buddhism. These were a traditional eight-spoked Dharma wheel and the five-colored flag.

== Early Buddhist symbols ==
The earliest Buddhist art is from the Mauryan era (322 BCE – 184 BCE), there is little archeological evidence for pre-Mauryan period symbolism. Early Buddhist art (circa 2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE) is commonly (but not exclusively) aniconic (i.e. lacking an anthropomorphic image), and instead used various symbols to depict the Buddha. The best examples of this aniconic period symbolism can be found at sites like Sanchi, Amaravati, Bharhut, Bodhgaya and Sarnath. According to Karlsson, three specific signs, the Bodhi tree, the Dharma wheel, and the stupa, occur frequently at all these major sites and thus &quot;the earliest Buddhist cult practice focused on these three objects&quot;.

Among the earliest and most common Buddhist symbols found in these early Buddhist sites are the stupa (and the relics therein), the Dharma wheel, the Bodhi Tree, the triratna (three jewels), the vajra seat, the lotus flower, and the Buddha footprint. Several animals are also widely depicted, such as elephants, lions, nāga and deer. Contemporary Buddhist art contains numerous symbols, including unique symbols not found in early Buddhism.

== Southeast Asian Buddhist symbols ==
Theravada Buddhist art is strongly influenced by the Indian Buddhist art styles like the Amaravati and Gupta styles. Thus, Theravada Buddhism retained most of the classic Indian Buddhist symbols such as the Dharma wheel, though in many cases, these symbols became more elaborately decorated with gold, jewels and other designs.

Different artistic styles also developed throughout the Theravada world as well as unique ways of depicting the Buddha (such as the Thai style and the Khmer style) containing their own ways of using Buddhist symbols.

== East Asian Buddhist symbols ==

East Asian Buddhism adopted many of the classic Buddhist symbolism outlined above. During the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE) Buddhist symbolism became widespread, and symbols like the swastika and the Dharma wheel (Chinese: 法輪; pinyin: &quot;fălún&quot;, &quot;wheel of life&quot;) became well known in China. There were also more elaborate symbols, like Buddhist mandalas and complex images of Buddhas and bodhisattva figures.

There are also some symbols that are generally unique to East Asian Buddhism, including the purple robe(which indicated a particularly eminent monastic), the &quot;ruyi&quot; scepter, the &quot;wooden fish&quot;, the ring staff (&quot;khakkhara&quot;), The Eighteen Arhats (or Luohan) (Chinese: 十八羅漢)the &quot;ever burning lamp&quot; (&quot;changmingdeng&quot;) and various kinds of Buddhist amulets or charms, such as Japanese omamori and ofuda, and Chinese fu (符) or fulu.

Chinese Buddhism also adopted traditional pre-Buddhist Chinese symbols and deities, including money trees, Chinese dragons, and Chinese gods like the Jade emperor and various generals like Guan Yu. Japanese Buddhism also developed some unique symbols of its own. For example, in Japanese Zen, a widely used symbol is the ensō, a hand-drawn black circle.

==Vajrayana Buddhist symbols==
Mantric Buddhism (&quot;Guhyamantra&quot;, &quot;Secret Mantra&quot;) or Vajrayana has numerous esoteric symbols which are not common in other forms of Buddhism.

The vajra is a key symbol in Vajrayana Buddhism. It represents indestructibility (like a diamond), emptiness as well as power (like a thunder bolt, which was the weapon of the Vedic god Indra). According to Beer, it represents &quot;the impenetrable, imperishable, immovable, immutable, indivisible, and indestructible state of absolute reality, which is the enlightenment of Buddhahood.&quot; The vajra is often paired with a bell (&quot;vajra-ghanta&quot;), which represents the feminine principle of wisdom. When paired together, they represent the perfect union of wisdom or emptiness (bell) and method or skilful means (&quot;vajra&quot;). There is also what is called the &quot;crossed vajra&quot; (&quot;vishva-vajra&quot;), which has four vajra heads emanating from a central hub.

Other tantric ritual symbols include the ritual knife (&quot;kila&quot;), tantric staff (&quot;khatvanga&quot;), the skull cup (&quot;kapala&quot;), the flaying knife (&quot;kartika&quot;), hand drum (&quot;damaru&quot;) and the thigh bone trumpet (&quot;kangling&quot;).

Other Vajrayana symbols popular in Tibetan Buddhism include the bhavacakra (wheel of life), mandalas, the number 108 and the Buddha eyes (or wisdom eyes) commonly seen on Nepalese stupas such as at Boudhanath.

There are various mythical creatures used in Vajrayana art as well: Snow Lion, Wind Horse, dragon, garuda and tiger. The popular mantra &quot;om mani padme hum&quot; is widely used to symbolize compassion and is commonly seen inscribed on rocks, prayer wheels, stupas and art. In Dzogchen, the mirror is one important symbol of rigpa.

=== Tibetan Buddhist architecture ===
Tibetan Buddhist architecture is centered on the stupa, called in Tibetan . The chörten consists of five parts that represent the mahābhūta (five elements). The base is square which represents the earth element, above that sits a dome representing water, on that is a cone representing fire, on the tip of the cone is a crescent representing air, inside the crescent is a flame representing ether. The tapering of the flame to a point can also be said to represent consciousness as a sixth element. The chörten presents these elements of the body in the order of the process of dissolution at death.

Tibetan temples are often three-storied. The three can represent many aspects such as the Trikaya (three aspects) of a Buddha. The ground story may have a statue of the historical Buddha Gautama and depictions of Earth and so represent the nirmāṇakāya. The first story may have Buddha and elaborate ornamentation representing rising above the human condition and the sambhogakāya. The second story may have a primordial Adi-Buddha in Yab-Yum (sexual union with his female counterpart) and be otherwise unadorned representing a return to the absolute reality and the dharmakāya &quot;truth body&quot;.
=== Colour in Tibetan Buddhism ===
In Tibetan Buddhist art, various colors and elements are associated with the five Buddha families and other aspects and symbols:
The five colors (Sanskrit &quot;pañcavarṇa&quot; – white, green, yellow, blue, red) are supplemented by several other colors including black and orange and gold (which is commonly associated with yellow). They are commonly used for prayer flags as well as for visualizing deities and spiritual energy, construction of mandalas and the painting of religions icons.

=== Indo-Tibetan visual art ===
Indo-Tibetan Buddhism visual art contains numerous esoteric figures and symbols. There are different types of visual art in Indo-Tibetan Vajrayana. Mandalas are genre of Buddhist art that contains numerous symbols and images in a circle and are an important element of tantric ritual. Thangkas are cloth paintings which are commonly used throughout the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist world.

Tibetan Buddhist deities may often assume different roles and are thus drawn, sculpted and visualized differently according to these roles. For example, Green Tara and White Tara which are different aspects of Tara that have different meanings. Green Tara is associated with protecting people from fear while the White Tara is associated with longevity. Shakyamuni Buddha may be seen in (pale) yellow or orange skin and Amitabha Buddha is typically red. These deities may also hold various attributes and implements in their hands, like flowers, jewels, bowls and sutras. Depictions of &quot;wrathful deities&quot; are often very fearsome, with monstrous visages, wearing skulls or bodily parts. They also may carry all sorts of weapons or fierce tools, like tridents, flaying knives and skull cups. The fierceness of these deities symbolizes the fierce energy needed to overcome ignorance.

Vajrayana Buddhism often specifies the number of feet of a Buddha or bodhisattva. While two is common there may also be ten, sixteen, or twenty-four feet. The position of the feet/legs may also have a specific meaning such as in Green Tara who is typically depicted as seated partly cross-legged but with one leg down symbolising &quot;immersion within in the absolute, in meditation&quot; and readiness to step forth and help sentient beings by &quot;engagement without in the world through compassion&quot;.

== Symbolic physical attributes ==
Buddhist material and visual culture as well as ritual tools (such as robes and bells) have often developed various symbolic meanings which are commonly shared by Buddhist sects around the world.

=== Robes and baldness ===
The style and design of the robes of a monastic often indicate the sect of Buddhism, tradition or country, they belong to. In most Buddhist cultures, the Buddhist monastic robe represents a renunciant monastic. Different traditions, sects of Buddhism (and different countries) will have robes of different colors as well as different styles or ways on how they wear it. Once Buddhism spread throughout China back in sixth century BCE, it was seen wrong to show that much skin, and that&#x27;s when robes to cover both arms with long sleeves came in to play. In Tibet, it have changed over time and they show both their shoulders as well as having a two piece attire rather than one. Shortly thereafter, Japan integrated a bib along with their long sleeve robe called a &quot;koromo&quot;. This was a clothing piece made specifically for their school of Zen which they practice in &quot;Takahatsu&quot; that involves the monks of Japan wearing a straw hat.

Shaving ones head is another ritual and symbolic act most Buddhist monastics complete before entering a monastic order. To shave ones head merely signifies ones readiness to enter into the monastic path and abandon the worldly life.

=== Tools ===
Buddhist monks traditionally carry an alms bowl, and this is another common symbol of Buddhist monastics around the world (even though not all modern Buddhist traditions make use of the traditional practice of collecting alms as the source of their daily nutriment).

In all sects of Buddhism, bells are often used to signify the start of rituals or to mark time. They use the bell to detain away the bad spirits and have the Buddha protect them at the time of their ritual. Some sects call this a part of the &quot;Mystic Law&quot; which is the beginning of a Buddhist ritual. Other ritual tools include drums, wooden fish, trumpets, the keisaku, and the tantric the vajra and bell.

=== Physical gestures ===
Another form of symbolism of the Buddhist is the joining of your hands together at prayer or at the time of the ritual (&quot;añjali mudrā&quot;). Buddhist compare their fingers with the petals of the lotus flower. Bowing down is another form of symbolic position in the act of the ritual, when Buddhist bow in front of the Buddha or to another person they aren&#x27;t bowing at the physical (the human or the statue) but they are bowing at the Buddha inside of them (the human) or it (the statue).

Mudras are another form of physical hand expression in the Buddhist faith, used to evoke a particular state of mind in buddhist practice. The most recognized mundras are seen in artistic depictions of the Buddha. Every mundra has a symbolic function and an inner symbolic function, for communication to the practitioner as well as those who perceive it. In Buddhist ceremonies, a mundra acts as a form of visual &quot;seal,&quot; affirming a faithful vow such as warding off evil spirits. They often accompany mantras when used in practice.

== Notable symbols ==
=== Buddhist flag ===

The five-colored flag was designed in Sri Lanka in the 1880s with the assistance of Henry Steel Olcott. The six vertical bands of the flag represent the six colors of the aura which Buddhists believe emanated from the body of the Buddha when he attained Enlightenment.

=== Dharma wheel ===
The Dharma wheel (&quot;dharma-chakra&quot;) is one of the earliest Buddhist symbols. It is an ancient Indian symbol of sovereignty and auspiciousness (as well as the sun god Surya) which pre-dates Buddhism and was adopted by early Buddhists. It appears in early Buddhist sites such as Sanchi and Bharhut, where it is a symbol of the Buddha himself. The Dharma wheel also represents the Dharma (Buddha&#x27;s teaching, the ultimate truth). The main idea of this symbol is that the Buddha was seen as a person who &quot;turned the wheel&quot;, which signifies a great and revolutionary moment in history (i.e. the teaching of the Buddha&#x27;s Dharma at Varanasi). While the Buddha &quot;could&quot; have become a great king, he instead chose to become a great sage. Illustrations from early Buddhist sites as well as Buddhist texts like the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, indicate that the worship of Dharma wheels on pillars (&quot;wheel pillars&quot;, &quot;cakrastambha&quot;) was a common practice in early Buddhism.The Dharma wheel is thus also a royal symbol, indicating a king who is a chakravartin (&quot;Turner of the Wheel&quot;). In the Buddhist scriptures, it is described as a royal treasure of great, world class kings, a perfect wheel with a thousand spokes. Because of this, it was thus also used by the Mauryans, especially Ashoka (in the Pillars of Ashoka). According to Karlsson &quot;the association between the numbers of the spokes and a special Buddhist doctrine is a later interpretation and not present in early Buddhist art.&quot; Early Buddhist depictions contain wheels with various number of spokes (8, 16, 20, 25 and 32).

=== Bodhi tree ===

The Bodhi Tree (Pali: &quot;bodhirukka&quot;) was a ficus (&quot;ficus religiosa&quot;) which stood is on the spot where the Buddha reached awakening (&quot;bodhi&quot;), called the bodhimanda (place of awakening). This tree has been venerated since early Buddhist times and a shrine was built for it. Offerings to the Buddha were offered to the tree. The Bodhi tree (often paired with an empty seat or āsana) thus represents the Buddha himself, as well as liberation and nirvana. Branches and saplings from the Bodhi tree were sent to other regions as well. It is said that when the Buddha was born, the Bodhi tree sprung up on the bodhimanda at the same time. The worship of trees is an ancient Indian custom which can be found as far back as in the Indus Valley Civilization.

===Stupa===

Stūpas (literally &quot;heap&quot;) are domed structures which may derive from ancient Indian funerary mounds. The earliest Buddhist stupas are from about the 3rd century BCE. In the early Buddhist texts, the Buddha&#x27;s bodily relics (&quot;śarīra,&quot; the bones leftover from cremation) were said to have been placed in various stūpas and therefore, Buddhist stūpas are generally symbolic of the Buddha himself, particularly his passing away (final nirvana). It may even have been a belief of some early Buddhists that the presence of the Buddha or the Buddha&#x27;s power could be found in a stūpa.

Other relics belonging to the Buddha&#x27;s disciples were also enclosed in caskets and placed in stupas. Caskets with relics of Sariputta and Moggallana were found in Sanchi stupa number 3, while stupa number 2 contains a casket with relics from 10 monks (according to inscriptions). Stūpa were venerated by Buddhists, with offerings of flowers and the like.

Initially, Buddhist stūpas were simple domes which developed more elaborate and complex forms in later periods. Over time, the style and design of the stūpa evolved into unique and distinct regional styles (such as Asian pagodas and Tibetan &quot;chortens&quot;).

===Animals===

====Lion====

Early Buddhist art contains various animals. These include lions, nāgas, horses, elephants, and deer. Most of these are often symbolic of the Buddha himself (and some are epithets of the Buddha), though they may also be depicted as merely decorative illustrations depending on context. According to Jampa Choskyi, while the animals are considered to be symbols for the Buddha, lions are the symbols of the bodhisattvas or also known as the sons of the Buddha. Though the lion, is a symbol of royalty, sovereignty, and protection, is used as a symbol for the Buddha, who is also known as the &quot;lion of the Shakyas&quot;. Buddha&#x27;s teachings are referred to as the &quot;Lion&#x27;s Roar&quot; (sihanada) in the sutras, which symbolizes the supremacy of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching over all other spiritual teachings. When looking at the shrines on the iconography, the lions symbolize another role, which they are considered the bodhisattvas who can be seen as the sons of the Buddha.

====Elephant====
The Buddha was also symbolized by a white elephant, another Indian symbol of royal power. This symbol appears in the myth of Queen Maya when the Buddha takes the form of a white elephant to enter his mother&#x27;s womb. Though the characteristics that are emphasized are the animal&#x27;s strength and steadfastness, these are the ones that become the symbol for the individual&#x27;s mental and physical strength. The other way that the elephant is also a symbol of responsibility and earthiness. When looking at the myth in India about elephants, the way that the myth goes is that the Airavata and the flying elephants would be used as a vehicle for transportation. The elephant was said to be seen seemingly emerging from the white ocean, these animals were seen as having special powers with one being the ability to produce rain. Not only, were they considered to have the power to produce rain, in Indian society, but they were also are a symbol of good luck and prosperity, and since they were Kings would own them and even used them in wars. The white elephant can also be seen as a symbol of mental strength, the elephant would start as a gray elephant that is rampant when the mind is uncontrollable. As the individual continues to practice dharma and can tame their mind, the gray elephant now becomes a white one, which is a symbol for strong and powerful, who only destroys in the directions that are willed by the individual. The tusks are also seen as an emblem of the Seven Royal Emblems. However, Gangpati or Ganesh is known to be an elephant-faced deity which is a form of the bodhisattva of Avalokitesvara. While, the elephant is seen as a deity when in the form of Avalokitesvara, the animal has used transportation for Tathagata Aksobhya and the deity Balabadra. Like the lion, the elephant is seen as a guardian of temples and the Buddha.

====Horse====
Some of the characteristics that are emphasized about the horse are their loyalty, industriousness. and swiftness. These characteristics can be seen in the riderless horse (representing the Buddha&#x27;s royal horse, Kanthaka) symbolizes the Buddha&#x27;s renunciation, and can be seen in some depictions of the &quot;Great Renunciation&quot; scene (along with Chandaka, the Buddha&#x27;s attendant holding up a royal umbrella). Meanwhile, deer represent Buddhist disciples, as the Buddha gave his first sermon at the deer park of Varanasi. In terms of Buddhism, the horse is a symbol of energy and effort when practicing dharma, along with the air or Prana that will run through the channels of the body. The &quot;Wind Horse&quot; is the transportation of the mind and can be ridden on. The deity that is associated with the horse is Lokesvara also known as Avalokitesvara, who also takes the form of a horse. When looking at Buddhist iconography, the horse is seen supporting the throne of Tathagatha Ratnasambhava. While they are used for support for Tathagatha Ratnasambhava, the animal is used as transportation for deities and dharma protectors, known as Mahali and the horse-faced deities, an example of this is Hayagriva.

====Naga====
The Buddha is also often called a &quot;great nāga&quot; in the sutras, which is a mythical serpent-like being with magical powers. However, this term is also generally indicative of the greatness and magical power of the Buddha, whose psychic power (siddhi) is greater than that of all gods (devas), nature spirits (yakkha), or nāgas. Another important nāga is Mucalinda, king of the nāgas, who is known for having protected the Buddha from storms.

====Peacock====

The peacock has multiple distinctly different symbols for which it is considered in different parts of the world and religions; however, in Buddhism, the peacock is a symbol of wisdom. The way they are connected to the bodhisattvas is by the peacock&#x27;s ability to eat a poisonous plant without getting affected by the plant, which correlates with the bodhisattva&#x27;s path toward enlightenment. The bodhisattva&#x27;s path begins with delusions, ignorance, desire, lastly hatred, which all can be translated into moha, raga, dvesa. The opening of the colorful tail of the peacock can be compared to the enlightenment of the bodhisattva. The tradition that comes with the symbol of the peacock is when the bodhisattva becomes enlightened. The bodhisattva&#x27;s body is adorned with five brightly colored feathers (red, blue, green, and others) that can be seen on the body. During the ceremony, the bodhisattva eats the same poisonous plants as the peacock, as it happens, the feathers slowly change colors since, like the peacock, these individuals are not worried about the harm that may come to them. Essentially the peacock is a symbol of the change from the path of desire to the path of liberation. The deities that are associated with the peacock is Amitabha, who happens to represent desire and attachment into changes into liberation. Along with the peacock being a symbol in Buddhism, birds as a whole can be seen to be a part of the mantra said during &quot;Wheel of Law&quot;, which has “Aum or Om Mani Padme Hung or hum rhi” as the individual symbols. When said together, the translation of the mantra is &quot;Adoration to the jewel in the Lotus Amen&quot;. According to Tseten Namgyal. states that the symbols represented as &quot;Om corresponding angels, Mani representing demons, Padme as men, hum as quadrupeds srhi as birds and reptiles&quot;.

====Garuda====

Garuda is also known as the king of the birds. When looking at the origins of the name it comes from Gri meaning to swallow since he devours snakes. The way he is represented in iconographies, he can either be seen with the upper body of a human, that has big eyes, a beak, short blue horns, yellow hair standing on the end, a bird&#x27;s claws and wings. In Hinduism, he can be represented as a human with wings. However, when looking at the symbolism of Garuda, it represents the space element and the power of the sun. Though when looking at the representation from a spiritual view, Garuda represents the spiritual energy that will devour the delusions from jealousy and hatred (represented by snakes). Since he represents the space element, this includes the openness that can be seen when he stretches his wings. Though, when looking at Buddhism specifically, he can represent the dana paramita, when the sun&#x27;s rays give life to the earth. The deity that Garuda is associated with is Amoghasiddhi, which is the vehicle of the deity. Through this, he is also the vehicle form of Lokishvara Hariharihar vahana. However, he is a deity of his own, who is said to be able to cure the bites of snakes, epilepsy, and diseases caused by nagas. Garuda can be found in toranas which are the semicircular tympanum that stands above the temple doors. Along with an emerald that happens to be named Garuda stone which is said to be protection against poison. Images of the deity are on jewelry as protection against the bites of snakes.

====Prevention of killing animals in Japan====
During the early days in Japan, there were some places in the country that would allow the killing of animals in the region. However, Buddhism was transmitted to the country by China via the Korean peninsula. One of the teachings that resonated with the Japanese people was the basic laws of Buddhist ethics that had a part of the laws included the commandment to not kill which was similar to the principle of benevolence or jin, 仁. So from the 7th century onwards, the rulers would prohibit the killing of animals since the animals would be a symbol of benevolent rule for these rulers. What this meant for the animals that were kept by imperial officials included dogs, falcons, and cormorants to name a few who were used for hunting purposes were to be set free. Their offices once used for hunting were abolished later on and the personnel who worked there would be transferred. Though the longevity of these decrees did not last long, the decrees had a long-lasting effect on the norms, values, and behavior of at least the upper class of Japanese society for the next several hundred years.

===Lotus===
The Indian lotus (&quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;padma&quot;) is an ancient symbol of purity, detachment and fertility, and it is used in various Indian religions. In Buddhism, the lotus is also another symbol for the Buddha and his awakening. In the Buddhist scriptures, the Buddha compares himself to a lotus (in Pali, &quot;paduma&quot;). Just like the lotus flower comes up from the muddy water unstained, the Buddha is said to transcend the world without stains. The Indian lotus also appears in early Buddhist sites like Sanchi and Bharhut. It is also the specific symbol of Amitabha, the Buddha of the Lotus family, as well as Avalokiteshvara (i.e. Padmapani, the &quot;lotus holder&quot;). In Tantric Buddhism, it is also symbolic for the vagina as well as for chakras (often visualized as lotuses).
===Triratna===
Another early symbol is the triratna (&quot;three jewels&quot;), also called a trident (&quot;trishula&quot;) in non-Buddhist contexts. According to Karlsson, the ancient pre-Buddhist symbol was initially seen as a &quot;weapon against enemies or Evil.&quot; In Buddhism, this symbol later came to represent the Buddha, Dharma (teaching, eternal law), and sangha (Buddhist monastic community).

===Vajrasana===

The Buddha throne, or empty seat/platform (&quot;āsana&quot;, later associated with the &quot;vajra seat&quot;, &quot;vajrāsana&quot;) is a symbol of the Buddha. The vajra seat or awakening seat represents the place where he sat down (in Bodh Gaya) to meditate and attained awakening. It thus also represents the place of awakening (&quot;bodhimanda&quot;) and is thus similar to the Bodhi tree in this regard. In early Buddhist art, the vajra seat may also be depicted as an empty seat (often under a tree) or a platform. However, these seats or platforms may not specifically symbolize the &quot;vajra seat&quot; itself and may just be an altar or a symbol of the Buddha. A vajra seat or empty seat may also be decorated with lotuses or be depicted as a giant lotus (in this case, it can be referred to as a &quot;lotus throne&quot;).

===Footprints===
The Buddha footprint (&quot;buddhapāda&quot;) represents the Buddha. These footprints were often placed on stone slabs, and are usually decorated with some other Buddhist symbol, such as a Dharma wheel, swastika, or triratna, indicating Buddhist identity. According to Karlsson, &quot;in the 3rd century AD as many as twelve signs can be seen on slabs from Nagarjunakonda. At that time we can found such signs as fishes, stupas, pillars, flowers, urns of plenty (&quot;purnaghata&quot;) and mollusc shells engraved on the buddhapada slab&quot;.

=== Chhatra ===
In some early reliefs, the Buddha is represented by a royal umbrella (&quot;chatra&quot;). Sometimes the chatra is depicted over an empty seat or a horse, and it is sometimes held by an attendant figure like Chandaka. In other depictions, the chatra is shown over an illustration of the Buddha himself. It also represents royalty and protection, as well as honor and respect.

===Indrakhila===
The &quot;Indrakhila&quot; (&quot;Indras post&quot;) which appears in early Buddhist sites has sometimes been interpreted as a symbol for the Buddha (but it could just be a symbol of auspiciousness). This is usually &quot;a series of formalized lotus plants one above the other, with artificial brackets in the borders from which hang jewelled garlands and necklaces of lucky talismans betokening both worldly and spiritual riches. At the top there is a trident and at the bottom a pair of footprints&quot;.

===Flaming pillar===
Another symbol which may indicate the Buddha is a &quot;flaming pillar&quot;. This may be a reference to the Twin Miracle at Savatthi and the Buddha&#x27;s magical abilities.

===Swastika===


The svastika was traditionally used in India to represent good fortune. This symbol was adopted to symbolize the auspiciousness of the Buddha. The left-facing svastika is often imprinted on the chest, feet or palms of Buddha images. The swastika was also a symbol of protection from evil. The ancient swastika (which are also Chinese characters, mainly 卍 and 卐) is common in Buddhist art. It is widely used in East Asia to represent Buddhism, and Buddhist temples. Buddhist symbols like the swastika have also been used as a family emblem (&quot;mon&quot;) by Japanese clans.

===Endless knot===

The endless knot is a symbol of good luck. It may also represent dependent origination.

It also symbolizes the &quot;endless wisdom and compassion for the Buddha,&quot; among other interpretations. The symbols are used in a variety of ways, such as greeting cards, ceremonial scarves, and in jewelry.

===Pair of fishes===
A pair of fishes (Sanskrit: &quot;matsyayugma&quot;) represent happiness and spontaneity as well as fertility and abundance. In Tantric Buddhism, it represents the left and right subtle body channels (nadis). In China, it often represents fidelity and conjugal unity.

=== Dhvaja ===
The victory banner was a military symbol of victory, and symbolizes the Buddha&#x27;s victory over Mara and the defilements (an epithet for the Buddha is the &quot;conqueror&quot;; in Sanskrit, Jina).

===Vase===
A treasure vase, which represents inexhaustible treasure and wealth, is also an attribute of wealth deities like Jambhala, Vaishravana and Vasudhara.

===Conch shell===
A conch shell represents victory, the spreading the teachings of the Buddha far and wide, and the aspect of speech. It is blown on auspicious events to announce (and also invite) the deities or other living beings of the happening of the auspicious event, such as marriages (in Sri Lanka).

===Ever-burning lamp===
The &quot;ever-burning lamp&quot; (&quot;changmingdeng&quot;) is &quot;an oil lamp kept in the monastery that in theory was never allowed to burn out&quot;. This was used as a symbol for the Buddhist teachings and for the &quot;mind of correct enlightenment&quot; (&quot;zhengjuexin&quot;).

===Ruyi===

Ruyi may have been used as a baton held by a speaker in a conversation (a talking stick), and later became imbued with different Buddhist meanings. The scepters exact usage is unknown, however, is depicted in ancient Chinese artwork commonly as being held by scholars. The artistic style mirrors Buddhist appreciation of natural forms. Ruyi scepters were often given as gifts.

===Wooden fish===
Wooden fish symbolized vigilance. In practice is a percussion instrument, known most commonly to the Western World as a Chinese temple block. It is symbolic of wakeful attention, as the eyes of a fish never close. The sound from the drum is believed to call the attention of divinity, and can also be associated with prayers for rain, the act of reincarnation, and wealth. In Buddhist services, the drum is struck persistently whilst the name of Buddha is chanted.


=== Ring staff ===

The ring staff is traditionally said to be useful in alerting nearby animals as well as alerting Buddhist donors of the monk&#x27;s presence (and thus is a symbol of the Buddhist monk).

===Number 108===

The number 108 is very sacred in Buddhism. It represents 108 kleshas of humankind to overcome in order to achieve enlightenment. In Japan, at the end of the year, a bell is chimed 108 times in Buddhist temples to finish the old year and welcome the new one. Each ring represents one of 108 earthly temptations (Bonnō) a person must overcome to achieve nirvana.

===Vajra===

A vajra is a ritual weapon symbolizing the properties of a diamond (indestructibility) and a thunderbolt (irresistible force). The vajra is a male polysemic symbol that represents many things for the tantrika. The vajra is representative of upaya (skilful means) whereas its companion tool, the bell which is a female symbol, denotes prajna (wisdom). Some deities are shown holding each the vajra and bell in separate hands, symbolizing the union of the forces of compassion and wisdom, respectively.

In the tantric traditions of Buddhism, the vajra is a symbol for the nature of reality, or sunyata, indicating endless creativity, potency, and skillful activity.

An instrument symbolizing vajra is also extensively used in the rituals of the tantra. It consists of a spherical central section, with two symmetrical sets of five prongs, which arc out from lotus blooms on either side of the sphere and come to a point at two points equidistant from the centre, thus giving it the appearance of a &quot;diamond sceptre&quot;, which is how the term is sometimes translated.

Various figures in Tantric iconography are represented holding or wielding the vajra.

The vajra is made up of several parts. In the center is a sphere which represents Sunyata, the primordial nature of the universe, the underlying unity of all things. Emerging from the sphere are two eight petaled lotus flowers. One represents the phenomenal world (or in Buddhist terms Samsara), the other represents the noumenal world (Nirvana). This is one of the fundamental dichotomies which are perceived by the unenlightened.

Arranged equally around the mouth of the lotus are two, four, or eight creatures which are called makara. These are mythological half-fish, half-crocodile creatures made up of two or more animals, often representing the union of opposites (or a harmonisation of qualities that transcend our usual experience). From the mouths of the makara come tongues which come together in a point.

The five-pronged vajra (with four makara, plus a central prong) is the most commonly seen vajra. There is an elaborate system of correspondences between the five elements of the noumenal side of the vajra, and the phenomenal side. One important correspondence is between the five &quot;poisons&quot; with the five wisdoms. The five poisons are the mental states that obscure the original purity of a being&#x27;s mind, while the five wisdoms are the five most important aspects of the enlightened mind. Each of the five wisdoms is also associated with a Buddha figure (see also Five Wisdom Buddhas).

=== Bell ===

The vajra is almost always paired with a ritual bell. Tibetan term for a ritual bell used in Buddhist religious practices is tribu. Priests and devotees ring bells during the rituals. Together these ritual implements represent the inseparability of wisdom and compassion in the enlightened mindstream. During meditation ringing the bell represents the sound of Buddha teaching the dharma and symbolizes the attainment of wisdom and the understanding of emptiness. During the chanting of the mantras the Bell and Vajra are used together in a variety of different ritualistic ways to represent the union of the male and female principles.

The hollow of the bell represents the void from which all phenomena arise, including the sound of the bell, and the clapper represents form. Together they symbolize wisdom (emptiness) and compassion (form or appearance). The sound, like all phenomena, arises, radiates forth and then dissolves back into emptiness.

=== Enso ===
In Zen, ensō (円相, &quot;circular form&quot;) is a circle that is hand-drawn in one or two uninhibited brushstrokes to express a moment when the mind is free to let the body create. The ensō symbolizes absolute enlightenment, strength, elegance, the universe, and mu (the void). It is characterised by a minimalism born of Japanese aesthetics. The circle may be open or closed. In the former case, the circle is incomplete, allowing for movement and development as well as the perfection of all things. Zen practitioners relate the idea to wabi-sabi, the beauty of imperfection. When the circle is closed, it represents perfection, akin to Plato&#x27;s perfect form, the reason why the circle was used for centuries in the construction of cosmological models Once the ensō is drawn, one does not change it. It evidences the character of its creator and the context of its creation in a brief, continuous period of time. Ensō exemplifies the various dimensions of the Japanese wabi-sabi perspective and aesthetic: fukinsei (asymmetry, irregularity), kanso (simplicity), koko (basic; weathered), shizen (without pretense; natural), yugen (subtly profound grace), datsuzoku (freedom), and seijaku (tranquility).
=== Mudras ===

Mudras are a series of symbolic hand gestures in Buddhist art. There are numerous mudras with different meanings. Mudras are used to represent specific moments in the life of Gautama Buddha.

=== Other symbols ===

* Some deities such as Prajñaparamita and Manjushri are depicted as holding a flaming sword, symbolizing the power of wisdom (&quot;prajña&quot;).
* The gankyil or &quot;wheel of joy&quot; symbol, which can symbolize different sets of three ideas.
* Various kinds of jewels (&quot;mani, ratna&quot;), such as the cintamani or &quot;wish fulfilling jewel&quot;.
* Buddhist prayer beads (&quot;mala&quot;), which originated in India as a way to count prayers or mantras and commonly have 108 beads. 
*The wish fulfilling tree (&quot;kalpavriksha&quot;)
*The fly-whisk, which is a tool to drive away insects and thus symbolizes non-harming (&quot;ahimsa&quot;). 
*Yantra.

== Groups ==
=== The eight auspicious signs ===

Mahayana Buddhist art makes use of a common set of Indian &quot;eight auspicious symbols&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;aṣṭamaṅgala&quot;, , Tib. &quot;bkra-shis rtags-brgyad&quot;). These symbols were pre-Buddhist Indian symbols which were associated with kingship and may originally have included other symbols, like the swastika, the srivasta, a throne, a drum and a fly wisk (this is still part of the Newari Buddhist eight symbol list).

The most common set of &quot;Eight Auspicious Symbols&quot; (used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism) are:

# Lotus flower (Skt. padma; Pali. Paduma)
# Endless knot (srivasta, granthi) or &quot;curl of happiness&quot; (nandyavarta)
# Pair of golden fish (Skt. matsyayugma)
# Victory banner (Skt. dhvaja; Pali. dhaja)
# Dharma wheel (Skt. Dharmacakra Pali. Dhammacakka)
# Treasure vase (kumbha)
# Jeweled Parasol (Skt. chatra; Pali. Chatta)
# White Conch Shell (sankha)

=== Symbols on Feet of Buddha ===

Buddha footprints often bear distinguishing marks, such as a Dharmachakra at the centre of the sole, or the group of 32, 108 or 132 auspicious signs of the Buddha, engraved or painted on the sole.

<text>Interstate 182 (I-182) is an east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of Washington. It serves as a connector from I-82 to the Tri-Cities region that crosses the Columbia River on the Interstate 182 Bridge between Richland and Pasco. I-182 is long and entirely concurrent with U.S. Route 12 (US 12); it also intersects State Route 240 (SR 240) and US 395.

Business leaders in the Tri-Cities began lobbying for a freeway in 1958 after early alignments for I-82 were routed away from the area. I-182 was created by the federal government in 1969 as a compromise to the routing dispute, which allowed for direct access to the Tri-Cities and a bypass for other traffic. The new freeway would also include construction of a bridge between Richland and Pasco, proposed since the 1940s at the site of an earlier cable ferry that ran until 1931.

Construction on I-182 was scheduled to begin in 1971, but was delayed by opposition from conservation groups, disputes over interchange locations, and a federal freeze on highway funding in 1980. The first section to be built, over the Yakima River west of Richland, began construction in late 1980 and opened to traffic three years later. The Interstate 182 Bridge opened in November 1984 and linked to a longer section opened a month earlier in Pasco connecting to the existing US 12 bypass. The final sections of the freeway, between I-82 and Richland, opened to traffic in March 1986.

==Route description==
The freeway begins at a trumpet interchange with I-82 and US 12, located near Badger Mountain southwest of Richland. The I-182/US 12 concurrency travels through the Goose Gap in the Horse Heaven Hills and continues northeast into suburban Richland, cutting between housing subdivisions and big-box stores around the Queensgate Drive interchange. It then crosses over the Yakima River and intersects SR 240, beginning a short concurrency along the southern outskirts of central Richland while following the Tri-City Railroad. At the following interchange with George Washington Way, SR 240 splits from the freeway and travels southeast towards Kennewick.

From Richland, I-182 passes a golf course and crosses the Columbia River on the Interstate 182 Bridge, officially named the Lee–Volpentest Bridges, which carries six lanes and a section of the Sacagawea Heritage Trail on twin concrete spans. The freeway then enters Franklin County and passes through the suburban neighborhoods of western Pasco as it bends southeast after an interchange with Broadmoor Boulevard. It then passes Gesa Stadium, a minor league ballpark, at North Road 68 and reaches an interchange with US 395, which connects to downtown Kennewick via the Blue Bridge.

I-182 continues concurrently with US 12 and US 395 around the south side of the Columbia Basin College campus and utilizes an eastbound collector–distributor lane until its next interchange at 20th Avenue, near the entrance to the Tri-Cities Airport. The freeway passes between residential areas and a golf course before crossing over a railyard owned by the BNSF Railway north of Pasco&#x27;s Amtrak station. At a cloverleaf interchange with SR 397 northeast of Pasco, US 395 splits off to travel north towards Spokane. I-182 ends southeast of the interchange, while the roadway continues as US 12 towards Burbank and Walla Walla.

As a component of the Interstate Highway System, the entire corridor of I-182 is listed as part of the National Highway System, a national network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility; it is also part of the state government&#x27;s Highway of Statewide Significance program, recognizing its connection to major communities. The freeway is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey of traffic volume that is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 11,000 vehicles at the I-82 interchange to a maximum of 67,000 vehicles at its eastern interchange with SR 240. The corridor is served by several bus routes operated by Ben Franklin Transit and has two park-and-ride facilities.

==History==

===Predecessor highways and crossings===
The Tri-Cities region gained its first overland connection in July 1888 with the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s permanent bridge over the Columbia River between Kennewick and the new town of Pasco. A road bridge was opened nearby in October 1922 and became part of the Inland Empire Highway (State Road 3), a state highway created in 1913 to connect Ellensburg to the Palouse and Spokane. The Inland Empire Highway was incorporated into the national numbered highway system created in 1926, which divided it between several routes. The Tri-Cities section was part of US 410, an east–west route that connected Aberdeen to Lewiston, Idaho.

Richland&#x27;s sole Columbia River crossing was the Timmerman ferry, a cable ferry that ran from 1894 to 1931, but an alternate existed using the Yakima River bridge and a route through Kennewick. A fixed bridge north of the city was proposed in the 1940s and 1950s in response to job growth at North Richland&#x27;s Hanford Site under the jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The bridge was never funded for study, but the AEC built a four-lane bridge across the Yakima River to connect Richland to Kennewick in 1951 that replaced an earlier bailey bridge and helped relieve Hanford traffic.

===I-82 routing dispute===

I-82 was added to the Interstate Highway System in October 1957 by the federal government, which allocated approximately for the corridor from Ellensburg, Washington, to Pendleton, Oregon. The initial proposal from the federal government, which was approved by the Washington State Highway Commission in January 1958, would follow the Yakima Valley but bypass the Tri-Cities by turning south near Prosser or Mabton to cross the Columbia River near Boardman, Oregon. After the route was shifted east in 1958 to cross the Columbia River on the existing Umatilla Bridge, business leaders in the Tri-Cities began lobbying for a longer freeway to directly serve the area. In 1961, the state government ordered a feasibility study to examine a modified route that would serve the Tri-Cities, including the use of the Hanford Site to bypass the Yakima Valley. The study came in response to a lobbying effort from the Tri-Cities with support from Walla Walla leaders. The study initially concluded that a Tri-Cities alignment would be unable to stay within the maximum mileage from the federal Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) for the project, but a re-study was ordered in January 1962.

The results of the second study were unveiled by the Washington State Highway Commission in May 1963, including a route that would turn south at Kiona on the outskirts of the Tri-Cities. The commission instead chose a route that would turn south in Prosser, which sparked another round of requests the following year from the newly-formed Benton–Franklin Counties Good Roads Association. The association received support from local politicians, businessmen, and the Tri-City Nuclear Industrial Council among other groups. A separate feasibility study begun in 1965 recommended a longer alignment through southern Richland and northern Pasco that would continue along Lake Wallula towards Pendleton. This study was endorsed by the commission and the regional BPR office in December 1967 but remained opposed by Oregon groups.

===Planning and opposition===

I-182 was proposed by the federal government in late 1968 as a compromise between the Washington and Oregon highway commissions, which allowed the Interstate system to serve the Tri-Cities without a great impact to direct traffic bound for Oregon. Its designation and general route, from I-82 in Prosser to US 12 (which replaced US 410 in 1967) east of Pasco, was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on June 23, 1969. The Washington State Highway Commission also approved the general corridor for I-182 on July 22; the state legislature codified the highway as State Route 182 in 1971. Construction on the freeway was scheduled to begin as early as 1971 if engineering work was accelerated, but was delayed by limited funding and disputed routing decisions.

The new freeway would use part of the Pasco Bypass, which opened on June 11, 1965, as part of US 410. Other sections were redesigned through route revisions prompted by local requests, particularly in Pasco after the governments of Richland and Benton County approved a tentative design for two interchanges in October 1970. The state&#x27;s proposed alignment north of the Tri-Cities Airport was abandoned in favor of a southern route around the Columbia Basin College campus connecting to the Pasco Bypass. A proposed interchange on the east side of the proposed Columbia River bridge in western Pasco was also moved to Road 100 by the state highway commission.

An environmental impact statement (EIS) under the newly-enforceable National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was ordered for the project in early 1971 following protests from local conservation groups, such as the Lower Columbia Basin Audubon Society and Rattlesnake Hills chapter of the Sierra Club. They raised concerns on the impact of the proposed Columbia River bridge on wildlife, particularly waterfowl around nearby Columbia Point in the Yakima River Delta. They were joined by landowners protesting the routing of I-182 through farmland west of Richland, but were overruled by the Richland city council&#x27;s endorsement of the Goose Gap corridor in April 1971. The conservationists and landowners threatened to file a lawsuit against the Washington State Department of Highways for violating the NEPA, but halted their plans to sue after negotiations with the state following delays in bidding for the Kiona section in early 1973. The state government promised to not commit to a Richland-area route as a result of these negotiations.

===Route changes and funding===
The routing of I-182 also remained affected by the unresolved routing of I-82 between Prosser and Oregon; among the options considered were a full route through the Tri-Cities towards the Wallula Gap as well as routes in the Horse Heaven Hills with a north–south version of I-182 through Kennewick. A cross-state compromise was reached in late 1973, which allowed for I-82 to be routed through the Horse Heaven Hills to the southwest of the Tri-Cities and towards the Umatilla Bridge; a truncated version of I-182 would then run from an interchange near Badger Mountain to Pasco. The first freeway interchange built to Interstate Highway standards on the truncated section of I-182 was a full cloverleaf interchange at Oregon Avenue (now SR 397). It began construction in 1971 and opened in July 1973 as part of $2 million in improvements (equivalent to $ million in dollars) to the Pasco Bypass funded by the state.

The Federal Highway Administration (successor to the BPR) granted full approval to the corridor for I-182 in December 1976 and estimated its full cost at $90 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars); the EIS for the project and the Prosser–Oregon section of I-82 had been approved in October and the federal government found no significant impacts. The general design of I-182, including its interchanges and proposed location, were approved the following year after several public hearings and consultation with local governments. The Richland city government attempted to shift the location of the SR 240 interchange to the west side of the Yakima River, but withdrew those plans amid criticism from other local officials. In 1978, the Franklin County Board of Commissioners attempted to shift the Road 100 interchange east by to align with the existing road, which was opposed by local landowners who sought an angled interchange at Road 116 to serve future housing development. Following a study and several public hearings, the county commissioners voted the following year to confirm that the interchange location would follow Road 100; the vote was later upheld in a 1983 decision by the Washington Supreme Court following several appeals by opponents. The state government estimated that 37 homes, several warehouses, an adult movie theater, and part of a local golf course would need to be demolished or relocated to make way for the freeway.

Construction of I-182 was originally planned to be completed by 1979, but reduced revenue from the state&#x27;s gas tax, meant to match the federal government&#x27;s 90 percent contribution to Interstate construction funding, pushed back the start of construction by several years. Completion of I-182 was also delayed by a federal freeze on highway funding with major cutbacks on projects that had not begun construction ordered by the Carter administration in early 1980 due to a national inflation crisis. Washington received $55 million out of its requested $228 million allocation (equivalent to $ million out of $ million in dollars) for 1980, which caused planning delays on I-182 and other projects around the state. In June, former governor Albert D. Rosellini, as a member of the Washington State Transportation Commission, proposed earmarking all remaining federal funds to complete I-90 between Seattle and Bellevue while deferring other projects, but the commission rejected his proposal following public outcry.

The federal government released $150 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) of Washington&#x27;s 1981 allocation in October 1980, which allowed for bidding to construct I-182 to begin amid the wait for more funding. The state legislature passed a law in March 1982 that would allow WSDOT (successor to the highways department) to sell short-term municipal bonds in order to resume stalled projects, including I-182, until the federal government would be able to allocate more funds. A five-cent national gas tax increase in 1983 allowed for $16 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) in restored funds to be allocated to Washington, which was earmarked for I-82, I-182, and I-90.

===Construction===
Construction on I-182 was divided into three sections: the western half from I-82 to Road 100 in western Pasco with four interchanges, the eastern half from Road 100 to US 395 near the Columbia Basin College, and the existing Pasco Bypass carrying US 12 and US 395. In October 1980, construction on the first project in the western segment, the Yakima River Bridge (officially the R.C. Bremmer Bridge), began with the relocation of a nearby electrical line and railroad. The longer Columbia River Bridge broke ground on July 8, 1981, following three attempts to solicit construction bids, and was scheduled to be complete within three years.

Bidding on the Richland section of I-182 between the Yakima and Columbia rivers was delayed due to a months-long land dispute with the owner of a gravel pit on the site of a proposed interchange. The dispute was resolved with a tentative payment agreement in July 1981, which allowed construction to begin in April 1982. The section also included the partial closure of the city-owned Sham-Na-Pum golf course at Columbia Point, which was reconfigured to allow for continued play until its planned redevelopment into a shopping mall. The westbound span of the Yakima River Bridge opened for temporary use by two-way traffic in September 1983.

Construction on the east side of the river near Pasco began in early 1982; grading work on the West Pasco section was completed by the end of the year. The first overpass on I-182, which carried US 12 (now Kennedy Road) west of Richland, opened to traffic in April 1983. In April 1984, a section of SR 240 was rerouted onto the new lanes of I-182 in Richland in preparation for further work on the George Washington Way interchange. US 12 was redirected to a loop ramp at the Columbia Basin College interchange in June 1984, which caused complaints due to its slower speeds compared to the direct ramp that was to be demolished for the interchange. A section in Pasco between Road 100 and Columbia Basin College was completed in September 1984 but remained unopened for another month due to delays in light installation.

The Interstate 182 Bridge over the Columbia River, officially named the Lee–Volpentest Bridges, was dedicated on November 27, 1984. It cost $28 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) to construct and was the first major bridge in the state to use post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete. The north span of the bridge was initially opened to two-way traffic while work was completed on the south span, which took until 1986. The bridge&#x27;s opening triggered new housing development in western Pasco, primarily to serve Hanford workers who saw large reductions in their commuting distance.

Paving of the westernmost section of I-182, between I-82 and Richland, began in July 1985 under the M.A. Segale Construction Company as part of the final phase of major construction for the freeway. The section was paved by the end of the year, but the freeway remained closed to traffic due to cold weather delaying final preparations for use. The Richland section between US 12 and George Washington Way was opened on January 8, 1986, following an additional delay while new signs were reinstalled after they had been knocked over in a windstorm. The I-82 interchange opened on March 27 and marked the full completion of I-182; the highways were opened on an accelerated schedule to be used as a detour during a long-term closure of the nearby Blue Bridge for re-decking.

===Later projects===

The completion of I-182 triggered plans for new commercial and residential development at its interchanges in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly Kennedy Road (now Queensgate Drive) in Richland, Road 100 (renamed Broadmoor Boulevard in 1996) in western Pasco, and Road 68 in Pasco. The Queensgate Drive interchange was rebuilt from 2001 to 2005 at a cost of $2.3 million to add a westbound auxiliary lane on I-182 and a loop ramp for southbound traffic. Construction began in July 2001, and the loop ramp opened to traffic in October of that year; it was followed by the auxiliary lane, which was completed in November 2005. A second phase to add a matching ramp and auxiliary lane for eastbound traffic was left unfunded with a projected cost of $4.6 million. The city of Richland later replaced the east half of the interchange with a roundabout that opened in August 2018. The Broadmoor Boulevard interchange gained a westbound loop onramp in 2009, shortly after the city of Pasco completed improvements to the Road 68 loop ramps.

<text>The New Zealand Police () is the national police service and principal law enforcement agency of New Zealand, responsible for preventing crime, enhancing public safety, bringing offenders to justice, and maintaining public order. With over 15,000 personnel, it is the largest law enforcement agency in New Zealand and, with few exceptions, has primary jurisdiction over the majority of New Zealand criminal law. The New Zealand Police also has responsibility for traffic and commercial vehicle enforcement as well as other key responsibilities including protection of dignitaries, firearms licensing, and matters of national security.

Policing in New Zealand was introduced in 1840, modelled on similar constabularies that existed in Britain at that time. The constabulary was initially part police and part militia. By the end of the 19th century policing by consent was the goal. The New Zealand Police has generally enjoyed a reputation for mild policing, but there have been cases when the use of force was criticised, such as during the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand and the United States.

The current minister of police is Mark Mitchell. While the New Zealand Police is a government department with a minister responsible for it, the commissioner and sworn members swear allegiance directly to the sovereign and, by convention, have constabulary independence from the government of the day.

The New Zealand Police is perceived to have a minimal level of institutional corruption, though it is has been involved in a variety of controveries over it&#x27;s long history.

==Origins and history==
Prior to British colonization, law in New Zealand was based on Tikanga Māori and enforced by local Iwi leaders through formal assemblies called rūnanga, with enforcement action carried out by selected warriors or expert practiioners called tohunga.

=== Colonial Police: 1840 ===

The first formal policing service in New Zealand started in 1840 with the arrival of six constables of the New South Wales mounted police accompanying Lieutenant Governor William Hobson&#x27;s official landing party to form the colony of New Zealand. Governor Hobson empowered Police Magistrates to appoint constables to enforce British laws within the early settlements.

The early 1800s saw increased scrutiny of policing practices throughout the British Empire, inspired in particular by the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 which had introduced policing by consent. Despite these reforms, policing in colonial New Zealand continued to operate by force, especially towards Māori people. Supplemented by a small number of British soldiers, the Colonial Police played a significant role in extending British control beyond the first settlements.

===Armed Police Force: 1846===
Under governor George Grey, the colonial police forces were replaced by the Armed Police Force (APF) in 1846, under the &quot;Constabulary Act 1846&quot;. The subsequent &quot;Armed Constabulary Act 1867&quot; focused the force on dealing with unrest between the indigenous Māori and the encroaching European settlers and the force grew to 200 musket-trained men. The armed constabulary took part in military actions against Māori opponents Riwha Tītokowaru in Taranaki and Te Kooti in the central North Island in the final stages of the New Zealand Wars.

===New Zealand Constabulary Force: 1877===

The &quot;Provinces of New Zealand Act 1875&quot; abolished the early provinces of New Zealand, and as a result, the AFP merged with the assorted policing organizations present in the former provinces to form the New Zealand Constabulary Force in 1877. The new force had two main divisions: the Policing Branch in the cities and the Field Force, which continued to exercise military-style surveillance over Māori in some areas. The last significant operation of the Field Force was the crushing of Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi’s passive resistance movement at Parihaka in 1881.

===New Zealand Police Force: 1886===
The New Zealand Police Force was established as a single national law enforcement agency under the &quot;Police Force Act 1886&quot;.
At the same time, the militia functions of the Armed Constabulary were transferred to the New Zealand Permanent Militia by the &quot;Defence Act 1886&quot;.

Just a decade later, policing in New Zealand was given a significant overhaul. In 1898 there was a very constructive Royal Commission of Enquiry into New Zealand Police. The Royal Commission, which included the reforming Commissioner Tunbridge who had come from the Metropolitan Police in London, produced a far-reaching report which laid the basis for positive reform of New Zealand Police for the next several decades. A complete review of police legislation in 1908 built significantly off the Royal Commission&#x27;s work.

A further police force act, in 1947, reflected some changes of a growing New Zealand, and a country coming out of World War II. The most significant change in the structure and arrangement for police came after the departure of Commissioner Compton under a cloud of government and public concern over his management of Police in 1955. The appointment of a caretaker civilian leader of police, especially titled &quot;controller general&quot; to recognise his non-operational background, opened the windows on the organisation and allowed a period of positive and constructive development to take place.

In 1953 police horses were retired. 

=== New Zealand Police: 1958 ===
Despite being the same organisation in 1958, the word &quot;force&quot; was removed from the name with the Police Act 1958, which was a significant overhaul of police legislation.
On 1 July 1992, the Traffic Safety Service of the Ministry of Transport was merged with the police. Up until that time, the Ministry of Transport and local councils had been responsible for traffic law enforcement. In 2000, the police re-established a specialist road policing branch known as the &quot;highway patrol&quot;. Today the police are mainly responsible for enforcing traffic law, while local councils can appoint parking wardens, who can enforce traffic rules regarding parking and special vehicle lanes. In 2010, after some calls to split traffic enforcement again from standard police duties, it was decided that it would remain part of their duties, partly due to the public having shown &quot;enormous support&quot; for it remaining this way.

The Police Act 1958 was extensively reviewed starting in 2006, after a two and a half-year consultative process the Policing Act 2008 came into effect on 1 October 2008. The process included the world&#x27;s first use of a wiki to allow the public to submit or propose amendments. The wiki was open for less than two weeks, but drew international attention.

More recently, the New Zealand Police has been involved in international policing and peacekeeping missions to East Timor and the Solomon Islands, to assist these countries with establishing law and order after civil unrest. It has also been involved in community police training in Bougainville, in conjunction with Australian Federal Police. Other overseas deployments for regional assistance and relief have been to Afghanistan as part of the reconstruction effort, the Kingdom of Tonga, Thailand for the tsunami disaster and Indonesia after terrorist bombings. New Zealand Police maintains an international policing support network in eight foreign capitals, and has about 80 staff deployed in differing international missions.

===Female officers===

In 1936, there was &quot;a proposal to establish a women police branch in New Zealand&quot;, and former principal of the women&#x27;s section of the South Australia Police, Kate Cocks (1875–1954), attended to speak to the member of the government, the commissioner of police, and a gathering of women&#x27;s societies. Cocks was the first of two female officers in December 1915 with the SA Police, until her retirement in 1935, with the largest women&#x27;s section of all Australian state law enforcement agencies.

Women were first admitted to the police in 1941 but were not issued uniforms. One of the first intakes was Edna Pearce, who received the badge number S1 when she was finally issued a uniform in 1952. Pearce made the first arrest by a female police officer in New Zealand. By January 1949, officer R. M. Hadfield did a cross-Tasman interchange, working for two months in Sydney, a month in Melbourne, and Tasmania. At the time, female officers wore only small badges under their coat lapels. 1994 was the last year female officers had a separate uniform to men with the removal of skirts in 1995. In 2020, hijabs were introduced as part of the uniform for Muslim women.

In 2023 on international women&#x27;s day Director of Recruitment Paula Hill said “As at 31 January this year we had 2,679 full time equivalent constabulary women, this means 25.6% of all constabulary are women – this is the first international women’s day where more than 1 in 4 of the constabulary workforce in New Zealand Police are women.&quot;

In 1992 less than 10% of the New Zealand Police were women, but by 2024 38.5% of all New Zealand Police employees were women and 26.1% of all constabulary staff (excluding recruits) were women. This was a 0.5% increase over the previous year (2023) showing a continued improvement of the number of women in constabulary roles.

Early New Years Day 2025 Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming became the first female officer to be killed in the line of duty. Fleming was struck by a vehicle driving at speed in an attack described by the commissioner as &quot;an unprovoked and senseless act&quot;.

==Organisation==
The Police National Headquarters provides policy and planning advice as well as national oversight and management of the organisation. Although headed by a Commissioner, the New Zealand Police is a decentralised organisation divided into 12 districts.

Each district has a geographical area of responsibility and a central station from which subsidiary and suburban stations are managed. As of March 2019, there are 327 police stations around the country with nearly 12,000 staff who respond to more than 600,000 emergency 111 calls each year.

The Commissioner is in overall charge of the New Zealand Police. Assisting the Commissioner are two chief officers in the rank of Deputy Commissioner: Deputy Commissioner-Resource Management; and Deputy Commissioner-Operations.

Five chief officers in the rank of Assistant Commissioner and the Director of Intelligence report to the Deputy Commissioner-Operations. The Assistant Commissioner-Investigations/International is responsible for the National Criminal Investigations Group, the Organised and Financial Crime Agency New Zealand (OFCANZ), Financial Crime Group, International Services Group and Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police Secretariat. The Investigations and International Group leads the prevention, investigation, disruption and prosecution of serious and transnational crime. It also leads liaison, overseas deployment and capacity building with international policing partners. The Assistant Commissioner-Operations is responsible for Community Policing, Youth, Communications Centres, Operations Group, Prosecutions and Road Policing. The remaining three Assistant Commissioners command geographical policing areas – Upper North, Lower North and South. Each area is divided into three to five districts.

District Commanders hold the rank of superintendent, as do sworn National Managers, the road policing manager in the Waitemata District, responsible for the motorway network and traffic alcohol group. Area Commanders hold the rank of inspector as do Shift Commanders based in each of the three Communications Centres. District Section Commanders are typically senior sergeants.
The New Zealand Police is a member of Interpol and has close relationships with the Australian police forces, at both the state and federal level. Several New Zealand Police representatives are posted overseas in key New Zealand diplomatic missions.

It is acknowledged, by both police and legislation, that important and valuable roles in the performance of the functions of the police are played by: public agencies or bodies (for example, local authorities and state sectors), persons who hold certain statutory offices (for example, Maori Wardens), and parts of the private sector, especially the private security industry. It is also acknowledged that it is often appropriate, or even necessary, for police to perform some of its functions by working in cooperation with citizens, or other agencies or bodies.

===Police Prosecution Service (PPS)===

The New Zealand Police Prosecution Service (PPS) is a branch within police that is responsible for initiating all criminal prosecutions in New Zealand. Police prosecutors may be a sworn members of the police (normally a sergeant) or a civilian lawyer employed as a non-sworn member of the police - however being a practicing lawyer is not a requirement for the role. All other common law countries except for Australia have discontinued police prosecutions citing a general lack of independence and objectivity of police prosecutors which is likely to be compromised by close contact with police officers, adherence to police culture, and a desire to maintain positive relationships with fellow police officers and staff.

===Districts===

The New Zealand Police is organised into 12 districts: nine in the North Island and three in the South Island. Each district is subdivided into between two and four areas:

*Northland – based in Whangārei; divided into two areas: Far North (Kerikeri) and Whangarei-Kaipara (Whangārei).
*Waitematā – based in Henderson; divided into three areas: North (Orewa), West (Henderson), and East (Rosedale).
*Auckland City – based in Auckland Central; divided into three areas: West (Avondale), Central (Auckland Central), and East (Mount Wellington).
*Counties-Manukau – based in Manukau; divided into four areas: West (Ōtāhuhu), Central (Manurewa), East (Flat Bush), and South (Papakura).
*Waikato – based in Hamilton; divided into three areas: Hamilton City, Waikato West (Huntly), and Waikato East (Thames).
*Bay of Plenty – based in Rotorua; divided into four areas: Western Bay of Plenty (Tauranga), Eastern Bay of Plenty (Whakatāne), Rotorua, and Taupō.
*Eastern – based in Hastings; divided into two areas: Hawke&#x27;s Bay (Hastings) and Tairāwhiti (Gisborne).
*Central – based in Palmerston North; divided into three areas: Taranaki (New Plymouth), Whanganui, and Manawatū (Palmerston North).
*Wellington – based in Wellington; divided into four areas: Wellington City, Kapiti-Mana (Porirua), Hutt Valley (Lower Hutt), and Wairarapa (Masterton).
*Tasman – based in Nelson; divided into three areas: Nelson Bays (Nelson), Marlborough (Blenheim), and West Coast (Greymouth).
*Canterbury – based in Christchurch; divided into three areas: Christchurch Metro, Canterbury Rural (Rangiora) and Aoraki (Timaru).
*Southern – based in Dunedin; divided into three areas: Otago Coastal (Dunedin), Otago Lakes-Central (Queenstown), and Southland (Invercargill).

===Communications centres===
New Zealand Police operate five communications centres that are responsible for receiving 111 emergency calls, 105 non-emergency calls, *555 traffic calls and general calls for service and dispatching the relevant response. The centres include:
*Northern Communications Centre, based in Auckland is responsible for the northern half of the North Island, down to Hicks Bay, Desert Road south of Turangi, and Awakino
*Central Communications Centre, based in Wellington is responsible for the southern half of the North Island, from Mokau, Taumarunui, the Desert Road north of Waiouru, and Te Araroa in the north
*Digital Services Centre, based in Kāpiti is responsible for non-emergency communication such as the 105 non-emergency line
*Southern Communications Centre, based in the Christchurch Central Police Station, responsible for the South Island.

===Ranks===
A police employee becomes a constable by swearing the oath under section 22 of the New Zealand Policing Act 2008. Upon doing so the constable receives certain statutory powers and responsibilities, including the power of arrest. While constables make up the majority of the workforce, non-sworn staff and volunteers provide a wide range of support services where a constable&#x27;s statutory powers are not required. Rank insignia are worn on epaulettes. Officers of inspector rank and higher are commissioned by the Governor-General, but are still promoted from the ranks of non-commissioned officers. A recently graduated constable is considered a probationary constable for up to two years, until they have passed 10 workplace assessment standards. The completion of the above is known as obtaining permanent appointment.
Detective ranks somewhat parallel the street ranks up to detective superintendent. Trainee detectives spend a minimum of six months as a constable on trial after completing an intensive selection and induction course. During these initial six months they are required to pass four module based exams before progression to detective constable. They are then required to continue studying with another six exam based modules as well as a number of workplace assessments. Once the detective constable has completed all of this they are then required to sit a pre-requisite exam based on all of the exam based modules they have previously sat. If they are successful in passing this they attend the Royal New Zealand Police College where they complete their training with the Detective Qualification course before receiving the final designation of detective. All of these requirements are expected to be completed within two to three years.

The rank of Senior Constable is granted to Constables after 14 years of service and the Commissioner of Police is satisfied with their conduct. Senior Constables are well regarded within the New Zealand Police for their extensive policing experience, and are often used to train and mentor other police officers.

&quot;Detective&quot; and &quot;detective constable&quot; are considered designations and not specific ranks. That is, detectives do not outrank uniformed constables. Nevertheless, a police officer with a detective designation will generally assume control of a serious crime scene rather than a uniform staff member regardless of rank.

To promote to the rank of a sergeant, constables must have a good understanding of general policing and pass the Core Policing Knowledge examination. Once completed, they are then eligible for promotion.

Authorised officers are non-sworn staff who do not have the power of arrest. They work as jailers, guards, transport enforcement officers and specialist crime investigators, such as electronic crime investigators and forensic accountants. They wear black uniforms, rather than the blue uniforms of sworn officers. The number of authorised officers increased following the recommendation of a 2012 review of the police that they be used to take some of the workload from sworn officers.

==Insignia and uniform==

New Zealand police uniforms formerly followed the British model closely but, since the 1970s, a number of changes have been implemented. These include the adoption of a medium blue shade in place of dark blue, the abolition of custodian helmets and the substitution of synthetic leather jackets for silver buttoned tunics when on ordinary duty. The normal headdress is a peaked cap with blue and white Sillitoe tartan band and silver badge. Baseball caps and Akubra wide-brimmed hats are authorised for particular duties or climatic conditions. Stab resistant and high visibility vests are normally worn on duty. The body vests are also marked with Sillitoe tartan markings.

AOS and STG members, when deployed, wear the usual charcoal-coloured clothing used by armed-response and counter-terror units around the world. In 2008, a survey found strong staff support for the re-introduction of the white custodian helmets worn until 1995, to reinforce the police&#x27;s professional image.

==Equipment==

=== Communications ===
Police officers communicate with each other via Apple iPhones. For shorter, fast communication, front-line police officers also use radios.

In 2009 New Zealand Police began moving from using analogue two-way radios to trialling digital encrypted radios in the Wellington region. The trial was perceived as having been successful and New Zealand Police planned to roll out digital encrypted radios to all regions. However, this has not progressed as planned and only the main centres of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch have digital encryption.

===Fleet===

====Drones====
In 2012, the police began using drones also known as unmanned aerial vehicles. By 2013, drones had been used only twice; in one case a drone was used in a criminal investigation and led to charges being laid in court. Privacy Commissioner Marie Shroff said &quot;organisations using drones needed good privacy policies – or possibly a warrant&quot;.

====Helicopters====
The Air Support Unit, commonly known as its callsign Eagle, is based in Auckland at Auckland Heliport, Pikes Point, Onehunga and operates three Bell 429 GlobalRanger helicopters. Starting operation in 1988 the Eagle helicopters generally operate with a crew of three, one civilian pilot and two sworn officers who act as Tactical Flight Operators. The two Tactical Flight Operators, use a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera, with night-vision equipment, a night-sun spotlight and gyro-stabilised binoculars, to support ground staff during operations and incidents. Police say the vantage point in the sky allows the Tactical Flight Operators to coordinate ground units to best deal with the operation or incident. Since October 2017 the Eagle helicopter has been operating a 24/7 service equating to 3,300 flight hours annually. In February 2020, an Eagle helicopter was based in Christchurch at Christchurch Airport for a five-week trial that was eventually cancelled due to budgetary constraints. Despite the permanent Eagle operation being cancelled, the Eagle helicopter often travels to Christchurch and Wellington for major operations such as the 2022 Wellington Anti Mandate Protest.

====Maritime Units====
The New Zealand Police operates two maritime units, the &quot;Deodar III&quot; in Auckland commissioned in 2007 and its sister the &quot;Lady Elizabeth IV&quot; in Wellington commissioned in 2010. Both Maritime Units are supported by various smaller vessels. The two main vessels are able to operate past their harbour or gulf bounds, with the &quot;Lady Elizabeth IV&quot; sometimes traveling to Christchurch or New Plymouth for operations.

The current iteration of maritime units is designed to survive a roll over. This change came after the 1986 tragedy of the &quot;Lady Elizabeth II&quot; which after 13 years of operation capsized killing two police officers, Constable Glenn Hughes and Senior Sergeant Phil Ward.

====Road Vehicles====
The New Zealand Police has around 3500 road vehicles in its fleet with around 2200 of those vehicles being liveried frontline vehicles. The Skoda Superb Station Wagon is the current generic frontline road vehicle of choice for the New Zealand Police slowly replacing the Holden Commodore. Police use both the 162kW and 206kW models of the Skoda Superb with the police versions having a full-size spare instead of a space saver and cloth upholstery instead of leather. 

Police also use a wide variety of Utes (pickup trucks), motorbikes, SUV&#x27;s, trucks, and vans in various work groups across police. Utes and SUV&#x27;s are most commonly used in rural areas, but these vehicle are also used in urban areas. Trucks and vans are often used as Team Policing Units, Command Centres, Mobile Police Stations, Mobile Road Safety Base (previously booze bus). The Armed Offenders Squad has its own fleet of, unmarked Toyota Land Cruisers and prior to that Nissan Patrols equipped with bull bars and some with ballistic protection.

Liveried vehicles are known as Marked or Uniform and are most commonly white, but can be other standard factory colours with a chequered Battenburg markings yellow-blue livery. Liveried Vehicles make up the majority of the New Zealand Police fleet. In 2021 the New Zealand Police removed the iconic &quot;Safer Communities Together&quot; slogan from the side of their new vehicles instead using that area to promote the use of the 111 emergency and 105 non-emergency telephone numbers. Police also use a wide variety of vehicles without liveries with hidden emergency lights in standard factory colours, commonly known as unmarked or covert vehicles. 

The Highway Patrol and Motorway Patrol divisions mainly use the Skoda Superb slowly replacing the Holden Commodore LT variant along with the VF Commodore SV6 and Evoke. Highway Patrol and Motorway Patrol use the all-wheel drive 206kW model of the Skoda Superb which looks almost identical to other frontline liveried Skoda Superb. The main visual difference between generic frontline vehicles and Highway Patrol and Motorway Patrol vehicles is the livery which has special markings stating Highway Patrol or Motorway Patrol on the sides, back and front. 

Dog handlers have fully enclosed utility or station wagon vehicles, which may be liveried or unmarked, the livery on marked Dog Squad vehicles is the same yellow-blue Battenburg markings as other frontline police vehicles but have special markings that state Dog Unit on the sides, back and front. Dog Squad vehicles are equipped with cages in the rear and remotely operated canopy doors to allow the handler to release their dog if away from the vehicle.

According to then Commissioner of Police Andrew Coster, &quot;The New Zealand Police is committed to being a sustainable organisation&quot;. As such police use both fully electric vehicles (EV) and Plug in Hybrid Electric vehicles (PHEV). In March 2022 a road trial for PHEVs was launched, Fleet Service Group Manager Brian Yanko says, “It’s expected that the Škoda PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) will be suited to frontline duties in an environment allowing for downtime where it can recharge, a process which takes around seven-hours from a standard 240-volt wall outlet”. The trail was found to be a success as more PHEVs have been purchased and used around the country. In June 2023 police began road trials of five fully electric BMW i4s used by Highway Patrol. The trail was not to test the capability of the BMW i4 in the police fleet, instead to test the capability of electric vehicles within police.

The police and Ministry of Transport (see history above) had used a wide range of different cars and motorbikes over the years.

===Weapons===
New Zealand Police officers carry OC spray (pepper spray), batons and tasers (stun guns). The only officers who routinely carry firearms are members of the Dignitary Protection Squad, and those with dog and airport units. All officers are trained to use Glock 17 pistols and Bushmaster XM15 M4A3 Patrolman AR-15 type, semi-automatic rifles and wear a holster attachment in case they do need a pistol. Since 2012, frontline vehicles have had a locked box in the passenger foot-well containing two loaded and holstered Glock 17s and, in the rear of the vehicle, a locked case with two Bushmaster rifles and ballistic vests. Vehicles are fitted with alarms in case windows are broken. Each officer carries vehicle keys and safe keys.

The Police Association claims the carrying of handguns is inevitable. In January 2013, a Waikato officer was attacked by at least five men after he deployed his OC spray and Taser. His radio was taken from him and his pistol was &#x27;misplaced&#x27; during the attack. The Police Association&#x27;s request for routine carrying of firearms for all officers after this incident was dismissed by the Police Commissioner. The current firearm training and issuing policy has been criticised. Not all police officers receive regular firearm training and not all vehicles contain a firearm. In October 2015, unarmed officers at a routine police checkpoint at Te Atatū South who pursued a vehicle that sped off from the checkpoint were shot at from the offender&#x27;s vehicle. In December 2015, the Police Association referred to the incident while requesting that all frontline officers receive firearm training and that their vehicles contain a secured firearm. This was rejected.

In July 2015, the Police Commissioner announced that Tasers would be routinely carried by police officers. Tasers were first trialled in 2006 and in 2010 were rolled out throughout New Zealand with all frontline vehicles containing an X26 or X2 Taser in a locked box. As of February 2024 police have begun rolling out the new Taser 10 weapon system across the country to replace the outdated Taser X2. In 2012, figures showed that a &#x27;disproportionate number of people&#x27; targeted by police Tasers were mental health patients.

Police officers receive regular Police Integrated Tactical Training (PITT) with different levels of training, depending upon an officer&#x27;s role and responsibilities. In 2017, a training model was introduced, and the number of officers trained as so-called &#x27;Level 1 responders&#x27; increased to 79%. Level 1 includes training with pistols, rifles, tasers, defensive tactics, handcuffs, OC spray and batons. In 2019, Level 1 responder live-fire training and simunitions training increased by 50%. Police annually release a report of their use of force including OC spray, Tasers and firearms.

==== Armed Response Team ====
Starting on 28 October 2019 the Armed Response Team (ART) was a trail ran by the New Zealand Police, similar to the UK Armed Response Vehicle model of armed officers on the streets ready to support the frontline. Then Commissioner of police Mike Bush cited the 2019 Christchurch Mosque Attack and a rise in organised crime as reasons for the trial. The ART vehicles were often crewed by four Armed Offenders Squad (AOS) officers who delt with high risk situations. The staff were descripted by police as well trained and well equipped. During the trial the ARTs were involved in over 8000 events with around 200 of these being firearm events, no ART member ever fired their gun.

The trial ended on 26 April 2020 and on 9 June 2020, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster announced that the police would be scrapping their armed response teams after public feedback and consultation with the Māori and Pasifika communities. Public discussion around the armed response teams was influenced by concerns about police-community relations in light of the murder of George Floyd, which sparked protests around the world including New Zealand.

=== Stab Resistant Vests ===
In 2006 the New Zealand Police introduced stab-resistant vests, police used the Stab Resistant Body Armour (SRBA) and the ballistic Hard Armour Plate (HAP) used during firearm events as a ballistic cover plate. The SRBA was dark blue with police being written largely across the back with Sillitoe tartan markings above. On the front the police emblem and police was written much smaller on the left side over the heart with the Sillitoe tartan markings being shorter and across both lower shoulders. There were also two pouches over the stomach one on the left and one on the right with almost all tactical equipment being held on a duty belt. The stab-resistant vests were seen as a massive success and the SRBA was used until its replacement by the Body Armour System (BAS) in 2019. The BAS are a big upgrade with better stab-resistant technology, the ability to fit ballistic hard armour plates into the vest instead of having to wear an additional vest for ballistic protection and better ability to customise the vest layout of tactical equipment. The BAS looks similar to the SRBA with only subtle differences including the removal of the two pouches over the stomach being replaced with small straps that allow for any tactical equipment wanted to be stored on the vest instead of a duty belt and a new font for the police markings.

==Notable incidents==


On 8 October 1941, four police officers were killed by South Island farmer Stanley Graham, 40, who fired at them as they attempted to seize arms from his West Coast home at Kowhitirangi. After widespread searches, two policemen and a local civilian saw Graham carrying his rifle and ammunition belts on 20 October. He was shot by Constable James D&#x27;Arcy Quirke with a .303 rifle, from a distance of 25 metres, while crawling through a patch of scrub. He died early the next morning in Westland Hospital, Hokitika.

The police investigation into the murders of Harvey and Jeanette Crewe in 1970 was a turning point in the public&#x27;s perception of the police. A royal commission subsequently found that the police had planted evidence and framed Arthur Allan Thomas for the murder. Writer Keith Hunter believes this introduced &quot;a cynicism (in attitudes towards the police) that infects us today.&quot;
During the 1981 Springbok tour, the police formed three riot squads known as &quot;Red Squad,&quot; &quot;Blue Squad&quot; and &quot;White Squad&quot; to control anti-apartheid protesters who laid siege to rugby union fields where the touring team was playing. Police were described as being heavy-handed with their batons as they tried to &#x27;subdue&#x27; protesters opposed to the Springbok tour. The tour had a significant effect on public perceptions of the police who since this time &quot;have never been viewed with the same general benign approval&quot;.

In July 1985, the New Zealand Police arrested two French Action Service operatives after the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; was bombed and sunk in Auckland harbour. The rapid arrest was attributed to the high level of public support for the investigation.

In October 2007 at least 17 people were arrested in a series of raids under the Suppression of Terrorism Act and the Arms Act 1983. The raids targeted a range of political activists allegedly involved in illegal firearms activity. The case dragged on for nearly four years and cost taxpayers millions of dollars. Much of the surveillance evidence was found to have been gained illegally and charges against all but four defendants were dropped. The remaining four were charged with firearms offences, found guilty and sentenced to terms of imprisonment and home detention.

On 20 January 2012, the police flew in by helicopter and arrested Kim Dotcom and three others in Coatesville, Auckland, in an armed raid on Dotcom&#x27;s house following United States cybercrime indictments against him for on-line piracy via his internet file sharing company, Megaupload. Assets worth $17 million were seized including eighteen luxury cars, giant screen TVs and works of art. According to Dotcom, about 80 police officers were involved in the operation; the New Zealand police claimed it was between 20 and 30. The incident became controversial when a district court judge ruled that the warrants issued for the property seizures were invalid and it turned out the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) had broken the law when asked by police to spy on Dotcom.

==Police and civilian deaths==

===Police killed on duty===
Since 1 September 1886, 34 police officers have been killed by criminals.

A member of the New Zealand Police, Sergeant Stewart Graeme Guthrie, was the last New Zealand civilian recipient of the George Cross, which is awarded for conspicuous gallantry. He fired a warning shot near a gunman at Aramoana on 13 November 1990, but was killed by a return shot from the gunman, who also killed twelve others. , 34 police officers have been killed by criminal acts, and about 17 by accident, while in the performance of their official duties. The most recent police officer to be killed in the line of duty was Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming, who was struck by a vehicle in &quot;an unprovoked and senseless act&quot; early New Years Day.

===Civilian deaths involving police===
In June 2012 the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) released a comprehensive report on deaths in police custody. There were 27 deaths in the last ten years – ten of which were suicides. Seven deaths occurred when police were overly vigorous in the use of restraint. Another seven were &quot;caused by the detainee&#x27;s medical condition&quot; which got dramatically worse in police custody, and three deaths were drug related when police failed to ascertain the detainees were on drugs. Of the 27 deaths, the IPCA said only four &quot;involved serious neglect of duty or breaches of policy by police&quot;. On top of deaths in custody, police have shot and killed seven people in the last ten years. One was an innocent bystander, and another two were not carrying firearms but were carrying other weapons. The police were exonerated in all seven cases.

Numerous people have also died in collisions during or shortly after police car chases. In the five years after December 2003, 24 people died and 91 received serious injuries in police pursuits. Over this period, the IPCA made numerous recommendations to change police protocols, but the death rate continued to climb. In 2010, 18 drivers fleeing police were killed. Fourteen of the deaths were triggered by pursuits over minor offences rather than serious crimes. That year police conducted the fourth review of pursuit policy in six years and ignored key recommendations of the Independent Police Conduct Authority making only minor changes to the policy. Over the next 12 months, 15 drivers died in the course of police pursuits. 14% of pursuits result in a crash either by the police or the offender but police guidelines do not provide a predetermined speed at which officers should pull out of a pursuit. The IPCA has now recommended that pursuit policy would should require officers to &quot;state a reason for beginning a pursuit,&quot; and recommended compulsory alcohol and drug testing of police officers involved in fatal incidents.

==Counter-terrorism and military assistance==
Since 2005 the NZ Police&#x27;s main counterterrorism and threat assessment group is the National Security Investigations Team, previously known as the Special Investigation Group. The NSIT is composed of four teams in regional centres, with a remit that covers early intervention in cases of extremism, soliciting informants, and building relationships with communities. Public information on the NSIT was released in relation to criticism of its handling of right wing terrorism in the lead up to the Christchurch terror attack.

The NZ Police are accountable for the operational response to threats to national security, including terrorism. If an incident escalates to a level where their internal resources are unable to adequately deal with the issue (for example, a major arms encounter or a significant terrorist threat), the Police Incident Controller may call on extra assistance from the New Zealand Defence Force and in particular NZ&#x27;s Special Forces, the military focused New Zealand Special Air Service and terrorism focused Commando Squadron (D Squadron). Control of the incident remains with police throughout. As of 2009, the two military counter terrorist units have never been deployed in a domestic law-enforcement operation. Military resources such as Light Armoured Vehicles have been used and requested before, such as during the Napier shootings, and Royal New Zealand Air Force helicopters from No. 3 Squadron are often used to assist in search and rescue and cannabis eradication operations.

In 1964, the Armed Offenders Squad (AOS) was created to provide a specialist armed response unit, similar to the Metropolitan Police Service&#x27;s SC&amp;O19 in the United Kingdom. In addition to the AOS, the New Zealand Police maintain a full-time counter-terrorist unit, the Special Tactics Group (STG). Similar to the FBI&#x27;s Hostage Rescue Team, the STG train in dynamic entry and other tactics vital in high-risk situations. The STG train with the SAS and are the last line of law enforcement response available before a police Incident Controller calls in support from the Defence Force.

==Crime statistics==

Crime statistics are documented in the police annual report. The police also publish bi-yearly statistical summaries of crime for both New Zealand as a whole and each police district. In early 2005, crime statistics for both recorded crime and recorded apprehensions for the last 10 years were published by Statistics New Zealand. These statistics provide offence statistics related to individual sections of legislation and appear to be the most detailed national crime statistics available today.

<text>Aerial warfare is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines in warfare. Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy installations or a concentration of enemy troops or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel.

Historically, military aircraft have included lighter-than-air balloons carrying artillery observers; lighter-than-air airships for bombing cities; various sorts of reconnaissance, surveillance, and early warning aircraft carrying observers, cameras, and radar equipment; torpedo bombers to attack enemy vessels; and military air-sea rescue aircraft for saving downed airmen. Modern aerial warfare includes missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Surface forces are likely to respond to enemy air activity with anti-aircraft warfare.

== History ==

The history of aerial warfare began in ancient times, with the use of man-carrying kites in Ancient China. In the third century it progressed to balloon warfare. Airships (notably zeppelins) served in military use in the early years of the 20th century.

Heavier-than-air airplanes first went to war in the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, initially for aerial reconnaissance, and then for aerial combat to shoot down enemy reconnaissance planes. Aircraft continued to carry out these roles during World War I (1914-1918), where the use of planes and zeppelins for strategic bombing also emerged. The rise of fighter aircraft and of air-to-air combat led to a realisation of the desirability of achieving air superiority. Closer integration of attacking aircraft with ground operations (&quot;battlefield support&quot;) also developed during World War I.

During World War II (1939-1945), the use of strategic bombing increased, while airborne forces, missiles, and early precision-guided munitions were introduced. Aircraft carriers gained particular importance in the trans-oceanic projection of air power.

Ballistic missiles became of key importance during the Cold War, were armed with nuclear warheads, and were stockpiled by the United States and the Soviet Union to deter each other from using them.

Drone warfare using relatively cheap unmanned equipment proliferated in the 21st century, particularly after the start of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020.

== Aerial reconnaissance ==
Aerial reconnaissance is reconnaissance for a military or strategic purpose that is conducted using reconnaissance aircraft. This role can fulfil a variety of requirements, including the collection of imagery intelligence, observation of enemy maneuvers and artillery spotting.

== Air combat manoeuvring ==
Air combat manoeuvring (also known as ACM or dogfighting) is the tactical art of moving, turning and situating a fighter aircraft in order to attain a position from which an attack can be made on another aircraft. It relies on offensive and defensive basic fighter manoeuvring (BFM) to gain an advantage over an aerial opponent.

== Airborne forces ==
Airborne forces are military units, usually light infantry, set up to be moved by aircraft and &quot;dropped&quot; into battle, typically by parachute. Thus, they can be placed behind enemy lines, and have the capability to deploy almost anywhere with little warning. The formations are limited only by the number and size of their aircraft, so given enough capacity a huge force can appear &quot;out of nowhere&quot; in minutes, an action referred to as &quot;vertical envelopment&quot;.

Conversely, airborne forces typically lack the supplies and equipment for prolonged combat operations, and are therefore more suited for airhead operations than for long-term occupation; furthermore, parachute operations are particularly sensitive to adverse weather conditions. Advances in helicopter technology since World War II have brought increased flexibility to the scope of airborne operations, and air assaults have largely replaced large-scale parachute operations, and (almost) completely replaced combat glider operations.

== Airstrike ==
An airstrike or &quot;air strike&quot; is an offensive operation carried out by attack aircraft. Air strikes are mostly delivered from aircraft such as fighters, bombers, ground attack aircraft, and attack helicopters. The official definition includes all sorts of targets, including enemy air targets, but in popular use the term is usually narrowed to a tactical (small-scale) attack on a ground or naval objective. Weapons used in an airstrike can range from machine gun bullets and missiles to various types of bombs. It is also commonly referred to as an &quot;air raid&quot;.

In close air support, air strikes are usually controlled by trained observers for coordination with friendly ground troops in a manner derived from artillery tactics.

== Strategic bombing ==
Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying their morale or their economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy&#x27;s war-making capability.

== Anti-aircraft warfare ==
Anti-aircraft warfare or &quot;counter-air defence&quot; is defined by NATO as &quot;all measures designed to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air action.&quot; They include ground and air-based weapon systems, associated sensor systems, command and control arrangements and passive measures (e.g. barrage balloons). It may be used to protect naval, ground, and air forces in any location. However, for most countries the main effort has tended to be &#x27;homeland defence&#x27;. NATO refers to airborne air defence as &quot;counter-air&quot; and naval air defence as &quot;anti-aircraft warfare&quot;. Missile defence is an extension of air defence as are initiatives to adapt air defence to the task of intercepting any projectile in flight.

== Missiles ==
In modern usage, a missile is a self-propelled precision-guided munition system, as opposed to an unguided self-propelled munition, referred to as a rocket (although these too can also be guided). Missiles have four system components: targeting and/or missile guidance, flight system, engine, and warhead. Missiles come in types adapted for different purposes: surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missiles (ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, anti-tank, etc.), surface-to-air missiles (and anti-ballistic), air-to-air missiles, and anti-satellite weapons. All known existing missiles are designed to be propelled during powered flight by chemical reactions inside a rocket engine, jet engine, or other type of engine. Non-self-propelled airborne explosive devices are generally referred to as shells and usually have a shorter range than missiles.

In ordinary British-English usage predating guided weapons, a missile is &quot;any thrown object&quot;, such as objects thrown at players by rowdy spectators at a sporting event.

== UAVs ==

The advent of the unmanned aerial vehicle has dramatically revolutionised aerial warfare with multiple nations developing and/or purchasing UAV fleets. Several benchmarks have already occurred, including a UAV-fighter jet dogfight, probes of adversary air defense with UAVs, replacement of an operational flight wing&#x27;s aircraft with UAVs, control of UAVs qualifying the operator for &#x27;combat&#x27; status, UAV-control from the other side of the world, jamming and/or data-hijacking of UAVs in flight, as well as proposals to transfer fire authority to AI aboard a UAV. UAVs have quickly evolved from surveillance to combat roles.

The growing capability of UAVs has thrown into question the survivability and capability of manned fighter jets.

<text>A conference call (sometimes called an audio teleconference or ATC) is a telephone call in which several people share a telephone line at the same time. The conference call may be designed to allow the called party to participate during the call or set up so that the called party merely listens into the call and cannot speak.

The more limited three-way calling is available (usually at an extra charge) on home or office phone lines. For a three-way call, the first called party is dialed. Then the hook flash button (or recall button) is pressed and the other called party&#x27;s phone number is dialed. While it is ringing, flash/recall is pressed again to connect the three people together. This option allows callers to add a second outgoing call to an already connected call.

== Features ==

Conference calls can be designed so that the calling party calls the other participants and adds them to the call; however, participants are usually able to call into the conference call themselves by dialing a telephone number that connects to a &quot;conference bridge,&quot; which is a specialized type of equipment that links telephone lines.

Companies commonly use a specialized service provider who maintains the conference bridge, or who provides the phone numbers and PIN codes that participants dial to access the meeting or conference call. These service providers can often dial-out to participants, connecting them to call and introducing them to the parties who are on-the-line. The operators can also take additional information such as question and answer details and also enable and disable advanced conferencing features such as muting lines, muting participants and enabling a recording feature. An operator can often be summoned to conference call hosted by a service provider using a combination of keys on a users&#x27; (sometimes only the moderator) telephone keypad. The most common recall function is *0. (asterisk and the zero/operator key)

== Usage ==

Businesses use conference calls daily to meet with remote parties, both internally and outside of their company. Common applications are client meetings or sales presentations, project meetings and updates, regular team meetings, training classes and communication to employees who work in different locations. Conference calling is viewed as a primary means of cutting travel costs and allowing workers to be more productive by not having to go out-of-office for meetings.

Conference calls are used by nearly all United States public corporations to report their quarterly results. These calls usually allow for questions from stock analysts and are called earnings calls. A standard conference call begins with a disclaimer stating that anything said in the duration of the call may be a forward-looking statement, and that results may vary significantly. The CEO, CFO, or investor relations officer then will read the company&#x27;s quarterly report. Lastly, the call is opened for questions from analysts.

Conference calls are increasingly used in conjunction with web conferences, where presentations or documents are shared via the internet. This allows people on the call to view content such as corporate reports, sales figures and company data presented by one of the participants. The main benefit is that the presenter of the document can give clear explanations about details within the document, while others simultaneously view the presentation. Care should be taken not to mix video and audio source on the same network since the video feed can cause interruptions on sound quality.

Business conference calls are usually hosted or operator-assisted, with a variety of features.

Conference calls are also beginning to cross over into the world of podcasting and social networking, which in turn fosters new kinds of interaction patterns. Live streaming or broadcasting of conference calls allows a larger audience access to the call without dialing into a bridge. In addition, organizers of conference calls can publish a dial-in number alongside the audio stream, creating potential for audience members to dial in and interact.

== Legislation ==

The UK government has changed flexible working rights since 2014, so that employees who have been working full-time for a company or organisation can lawfully request flexible working. In recent years, there have been a number of different types of flexible working options as a result of conference calling technology enabling employees to work remotely.

In November 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) published a 732-page Order on InterCarrier Compensation (ICC), including rules governing revenue sharing. Citing Section 251(b)(5) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC mandated that terminating access rates for all calls (not just conference calls) be leveled in 2012 and 2013, then reduced in three increments over the subsequent three years until they reached $0 in 2017. These mostly sub-1 cent charges are replaced with an access recovery charge (ARC) that is added onto every customers&#x27; bill by their phone carriers. In other words, every phone company will get to keep the terminating access charges they had to pay out to connect each call while charging consumers more whether they make calls or not. This order has been challenged at the Federal Appeals Court by several parties.

As for revenue sharing, the order adds a measure for high volume call traffic which triggers an immediate terminating access charge reduction to the lowest rate of any carrier in that state.

In the United Kingdom, the 0870 prefix was originally used by UK-based free conference calling providers in order to receive a rebate from every call from a telephone company that owns the number. However, in April 2009 Ofcom, the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries, announced that the rebate that is payable to the telecom&#x27;s supplier when an 0870 number is used would be removed. Systems were soon moved to 0844 and 0871 prefixes in order to retain the revenue sharing arrangement, this means that whilst you wouldn&#x27;t pay the conference call provider directly, you would dial an expensive premium-rate number to access your conference call.

Recently in the UK, a very small number of conference call providers have begun to use 03 numbers, which are included in bundled minutes under Ofcom regulations. This has provided the option to hold conference calls without any costs whatsoever, as call are included in the minutes bundles provided by most UK network operators. There is a general trend for companies in the UK to more to 03 numbers for inbound services because these numbers are more palatable to the caller.

== Costs ==

=== Flat-rate ===

Flat-rate conferencing services are being offered which give unlimited access to a conference bridge at a fixed monthly cost. Because telecommunication carriers offer free long-distance bundled with local service, this alternative is gaining widespread popularity for budget conscious businesses and non-profits.

In the UK, there are conference services offered on a basis where the cost of the phone calls (using 0843/0844, or 0871/0872 non-geographic revenue sharing numbers) from each of the participants covers the cost of the conference service. With this service type there is no monthly charge and usually no contracts to sign.

=== Prepaid ===

Prepaid conference call services allow businesses and individuals to purchase conferencing services online, and conduct conference calls on a basis. Typically, a conference call PIN and its associated calling instructions are displayed immediately online after being purchased and/or sent via email. Generally, prepaid conference call services are used with a landline telephone, mobile phone, or computer, and there is no need to buy additional expensive telecommunications hardware or add/switch long-distance service. Some services allow one to start or join a conference call from virtually any country worldwide—with appropriate telephone access.

Large telecommunications providers such as AT&amp;T, Embarq (formerly Sprint), Verizon and other large to medium conferencing service providers maintain a dominant position in the conferencing niche; servicing many of the world&#x27;s biggest brands. However, the Internet and improved global VoIP networks have helped to significantly reduce the barrier of entry into this niche.

=== Free ===

Free conferencing is different from traditional conference calling in that it has no organizer fees, no human operator, and allows for multiple people to connect at no cost other than that of any other phone call (local or toll). Companies that provide free conference call services are usually compensated through a revenue-sharing arrangement with the local phone company, sharing the termination charge for incoming calls to a phone carrier.

In the case of free conference calling, the conferencing company strikes an agreement with the local phone company that hosts the conferencing bridge (equipment connecting lines) to receive a share of the terminating access charge received for connecting the call. At large carriers such as AT&amp;T and Verizon, they keep these access charges for their own conferencing services in addition to charging the customer for the conference service. With free conference calling, as mentioned above, there are no organizer fees so these services do not double-dip: the consumer pays for a regular call with the same three components – origination, transport, and termination – of any call. In other words, the call costs the same as any other call under the customer&#x27;s calling plan, but the conferencing is included for free to the host and participants of the conference call.

A distinct difference between sound quality of paid and free conference calls has been noted by customers who have claimed to hear background noises when using the free conferencing services, which rarely happens on paid conference calling services. 

=== Premium-rate ===

Here participants dial in on a premium-rate number such as a toll free number in the US. The conference is typically hosted by the party that perceives value in the call in order to justify the cost: this could be a business owner, a non-profit board member, an educator, lawyer, or expert in any given field. That person then usually pays for the cost of the call. Premium conferencing can also be used for charitable fundraisers.

Premium conferencing feature sets include:

* Reservationless or operator assisted conferencing
* Host PINs
* Name announce
* Roll-call (unique and superior)
* Moderator/participant codes
* Live web-based call management with mute/unmute, drop one/all, and dial out
* Recording with .wav file access through an online account
* High-quality on-demand transcriptions (with 4-hour turnaround on request)
* Customizable, &quot;branded&quot; greetings(unique)
* Broadcast mode
* Q&amp;A facilitation
* Polling and polling reports
* Sub-conferencing
* Dial-out with or without requested response
* Web based screen sharing options 
* 24/7 availability

== Standards ==

The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defined a technical specification (TS 24.147) for conferencing within the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP Events, the Session Description Protocol (SDP) and the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP, aka RFC4582).

<text>Interstate 184 (I-184) is a short auxiliary Interstate Highway in Boise, Idaho, United States. The only auxiliary Interstate in Idaho, it is a spur route of I-84 that connects the freeway to Downtown Boise, terminating at US Highway 20 (US 20) and US 26 on the west side of the Boise River.

The western section of the freeway, named the Boise Connector, opened to traffic in December 1968. It was designated as I-180N until a renumbering of I-84 that was approved in 1979. I-184 was extended to a new interchange with US 20 and US 26 in 1992 as part of a new Downtown Boise connector and bridge.

==Route description==
I-184, also known as the Boise Connector or just the &quot;Connector&quot;, is a short, six-lane urban freeway that travels between a junction with I-84 and the west side of Downtown Boise. Its western terminus is the &quot;Flying Wye&quot; interchange with I-84 and US 30 in southwestern Boise, which includes a braided ramp for adjacent exits on both freeways. I-184 travels northeast and crosses over a spur railroad near an interchange with Franklin Street on the south side of the Boise Towne Square shopping mall. The freeway then intersects Curtis Road near the Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center and turns due east along Fairview Avenue, which acts as a frontage road. On the west side of the Boise River in Rotary Park, I-184 terminates after an interchange with US 20 and US 26, which serve northwestern Boise and Garden City on Chinden Boulevard. US 20 and US 26 supersede I-184 and cross into Downtown Boise, where they split into the paired one-way Front and Myrtle streets.

I-184 is the only auxiliary Interstate Highway in Idaho and the state&#x27;s shortest, at . The highway is maintained by the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), which conducts an annual survey of traffic on certain highway segments that is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. The sole traffic recording device on I-184, tracking eastbound traffic near Cole Road, reported a daily average of 78,034 vehicles on the highway in 2022. From 2015 to 2022, traffic volumes increased by 3 percent—slower than other area roads—and congestion is typically worse near the Flying Wye interchange during the evening rush hour. According to the ITD, the average speed of traffic on the freeway in 2022 was , above the posted speed limit of .

==History==

The Boise Connector was planned in the early 1960s to connect the Boise freeway bypass to Downtown Boise and its inner neighborhoods. One version of the plan proposed a full loop bisecting Downtown Boise to carry I-80N, but it was rejected in favor of a less costly spur route. The westernmost section of the connector, including a sprawling wye interchange with I-80N, began construction in July 1965 and cost $9.5 million to build. It was opened to traffic on December 12, 1968, a year before the rest of the bypass, and initially terminated at Garden Street.

The freeway was numbered Interstate 180N (I-180N) until October 13, 1979, when I-184 was adopted to match I-84, which was planned to succeed I-80N effective May 1, 1980. It was the only signed suffixed auxiliary Interstate Highway in the nation. Parts of the connector were signed as part of State Highway 55 (SH-55) until it was realigned onto Eagle Road in September 1990. Eastbound traffic on US 30 was also used a section of I-180N before merging onto Main Street and Fairview Avenue. This concurrency was eliminated in 1980, when US 30 was relocated onto I-84.

Construction of the Broadway–Chinden Connector, which would connect I-184 with downtown Boise, began in January 1988 and cost $60 million to complete. The new bridge across the Boise River was opened on August 7, 1992, replacing a pair of smaller bridges to the north. The westernmost segment of I-184, including the Flying Wye interchange, was rebuilt from 1999 to 2004 to accommodate an additional set of lanes. The project cost $86 million (equivalent to $ in ) and was delayed approximately six months due to financial constraints and delays in bridge construction in the initial phase of the project.

<doc id="406764" wikidata="Q282687" url="?curid=406764" title="Black-capped chickadee">
<text>The black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) is a small, nonmigratory, North American passerine bird that lives in deciduous and mixed forests. It is a member of the Paridae family, also known as tits. It has a distinct black cap on its head, a black bib underneath, and white cheeks. It has a white belly, buff sides, and grey wings, back, and tail. The bird is well known for its vocalizations, including its &quot;fee-bee&quot; call and its &quot;chick-a-dee-dee-dee&quot; call, from which it derives its name.

The black-capped chickadee is widely distributed throughout North America, ranging from the northern United States to southern Canada and all the way up to Alaska and Yukon. It feeds primarily on insects and seeds, and is known for its ability to cache food for use during the winter. The hippocampus of the black-capped chickadee grows during the caching season, which is believed to help it better remember its cache locations. The black-capped chickadee is a social bird and forms strict dominance hierarchies within its flock. During the winter, these flocks include other bird species. It has the ability to lower its body temperature during cold winter nights, allowing it to conserve energy.

Black-capped chickadees build nests in tree cavities, with the nesting season starting in late April and lasting until late June. They lay on average 6–8 eggs, which hatch after 11–14 days. Juveniles fledge 12–16 days after hatching.

The population of black-capped chickadees is thought to be increasing, and they are considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is the state bird of both Massachusetts and Maine in the United States, and the provincial bird of New Brunswick in Canada.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760, French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the black-capped chickadee in his book &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Canada. He used the French name and the Latin &quot;Parus Canadensis Atricapillus&quot;. Although Brisson gave it Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. In 1766, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus published the 12th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, which included 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the black-capped chickadee. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Parus atricapillus&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific epithet &quot;atricapillus&quot; is Latin for &quot;black-haired&quot; from (black) and (hair of the head).

Though originally placed in the genus &quot;Parus&quot; with most other tits, mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data and morphology suggested that separating &quot;Poecile&quot; more adequately expressed these birds&#x27; relationships. The genus &quot;Poecile&quot; had been introduced by German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829, and the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union moved the black-capped chickadee into this genus in 1998. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the black-capped chickadee is sister to the mountain chickadee (&quot;Poecile gambeli&quot;).

The following cladogram shows the relationships between the various chickadee species, a subset of genus &quot;Poecile&quot;:

Until the late 1900s, the black-capped chickadee was considered by some to be conspecific with the willow tit of Eurasia and the Carolina chickadee, due to their very similar appearance. A 1989 study demonstrated that the Willow tit and black-capped chickadee were different species; however, the distinction of the Carolina chickadee remained in question until 2005.

===Subspecies===
Nine subspecies are currently recognized. They are presented below in the taxonomic order set by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC)
*&quot;Poecile atricapillus turneri&quot; : Found in southern Alaska and northwest Canada and has the palest colouring of all subspecies.
*&quot;Poecile atricapillus occidentalis&quot; : Ranges from southwest British Columbia to northwest California, and is the smallest in size and darkest in colouring of all subspecies.
*&quot;Poecile atricapillus fortuitus&quot; : Ranges from inland southwest Canada to northwest U.S., and is notably buffier than other subspecies.
*&quot;Poecile atricapillus septentrionalis&quot; : Ranges from western and central Canada to southern U.S. It is visually similar to &quot;P. a. atricapillus&quot; but has slightly longer wings and tail.
*&quot;Poecile atricapillus bartletti&quot; : Lives only in Newfoundland, Canada, and is the only species with different mtDNA, likely due to geographic isolation. It is larger and darker than &quot;P. a. atricapillus&quot;.
*&quot;Poecile atricapillus atricapillus&quot; : Nominate subspecies, which ranges from eastern and central Canada to northeastern U.S.
*&quot;Poecile atricapillus garrinus&quot; : Lives in western central U.S. It has a brown back and buff rump.
*&quot;Poecile atricapillus nevadensis&quot; : Lives in western U.S., and is visually similar to &quot;P. a. septentrionalis&quot; but with paler edges to the wings and tail.
*&quot;Poecile atricapillus practicus&quot; : Lives in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern U.S. Similar to &quot;P. a. atricapillus&quot;, although slightly smaller, less dark on the back, and less prominent white edge to the wings and tail.

==Description==
The black-capped chickadee has a black cap and &quot;bib&quot; with white cheeks. Its underparts are white with buff-colored flanks. Its back is unstreaked and greenish gray, and the tail and wings are slate gray. It has a black beak and legs, and dark brown irises. Males and females are generally similar, although males have a larger bib. They can also be distinguished based on a combination of weight and tail length. Tarsus length does not significantly differentiate sexes. Males have a wing length of , a tail length of , a bill length of , and a tarsus length of . Females are on average slightly smaller, with a wing length of , a tail length of , a bill length of , and a tarsus length of . Both sexes weigh . Juveniles are visually similar to adults but with fluffier plumage.

Although range can generally be used to separate them, the black-capped chickadee is very similar in appearance to the Carolina chickadee. The edges of the wings are somewhat paler than the Carolina chickadee, and the bib of the black-capped chickadee has a &quot;messier&quot; border than the Carolina chickadee. The most reliable way to distinguish the two species is by vocalizations. Black-capped chickadees have a slower, hoarser, two-part song, whereas Carolina chickadees have a three-part song.

Black-capped chickadees are also somewhat similar to mountain chickadees and boreal chickadees. Mountain chickadees can be distinguished by a distinct white stripe above their eyes, and boreal chickadees have a brown cap as opposed to the black cap of the black-capped chickadee.

===Vocalization===
The vocalizations of the black-capped chickadee are highly complex, with 16 distinct types of vocalizations being used to convey an array of information. These vocalizations are likely an evolutionary adaptation to their habitat; they live and feed in dense vegetation, and even when the flock is close together, individual birds tend to be out of each other&#x27;s visual range.

One of the most recognizable sounds produced, particularly by the males, is the two-note &quot;fee-bee&quot; song. It is a simple, clear whistle of two notes, identical in rhythm, the first roughly a whole-step above the second. 
The frequency of their songs typically starts around 400 Hz, and various tones spanning roughly 1 kHz are sung within the song. A decrease of roughly 200 Hz occurs when the first note (&quot;fee&quot;) is sung, and then another decrease around 400 Hz takes place between the end of &quot;fee&quot; and the beginning of &quot;bee&quot;. In spite of these multiple changes in frequency, though, anybody listening to the song only hears a pure, high-frequency tone. This is distinguished from the Carolina chickadee&#x27;s four-note call &quot;fee-bee fee-bay&quot;; the lower notes are nearly identical but the higher &quot;fee&quot; notes are omitted, making the black-capped song like &quot;bee bay&quot;. The males sing the song only in relative isolation from other chickadees (including their mates). In late summer, some young birds sing only a single note.

Both sexes sometimes make a faint version of the &quot;fee-bee&quot; song, and this appears to be used when feeding young. During breeding, the male may make this call to attempt to attract a female. During nesting, this call is used by both sexes to call to their partner when not in sight. Distinguishing males and females based solely on their singing is difficult. A bioacoustic analysis performed on both male and female songs revealed that male &quot;fee-bee&quot; singing fluctuates more, and the absolute amplitude of both sexes is the same.

The most familiar call is the &quot;chick-a-dee-dee-dee&quot;, which gave this bird its name. This simple-sounding call is astonishingly complex. Scientists have been studying it since the mid-1970s. It is produced by both males and females year-round. It has been observed to consist of up to four distinct units—referred to as A, B, C, and D. A, B, and C are variations of the &quot;chick-a&quot; part of the call, and D is the repeated &quot;dee&quot;. These can be arranged in different patterns to communicate information about threats from predators and coordination of group movement. These four notes only ever appear in this consecutive order with each preceding note blending into the next; however, not all four notes always appear in the call. Like other sounds the chickadee produces, it may be heard in multiple variations. The A and B notes are almost identical to one another in both frequency and duration, though black-capped chickadees possess the ability to quickly notice the difference between these two notes. No such similarity is seen between the C and D notes. The C note fluctuates from low to high then back to low, whereas the D note has a constant frequency. While not confirmed, one study found evidence of a function behind the C and D notes: the C note is used indicate the location of food, and the D note is used to distinguish between a member of the same species and a potential predator.

Neither individual notes nor groups of notes have an equal probability of appearing in the &quot;chick-a-dee-dee-dee&quot; song. Its syntax form may take on several different structures, but the two most commonly heard are [A][D] and [B][C][D]. Calls containing the D note are most frequently heard. A study of the call showed that the number of &quot;dee&quot;s indicates the level of threat from nearby predators. In an analysis of over 5,000 alarm calls from chickadees, alarm calls triggered by small, dangerous raptors had a shorter interval between &quot;chick&quot; and &quot;dee&quot; and tended to have extra &quot;dee&quot;s, typically four instead of two. In one case, a warning call about a pygmy owl—a prime threat to chickadees—contained 23 &quot;dee&quot;s. The Carolina chickadee makes a similar call, which is faster and higher-pitched.

Other species have also been observed making use of these &quot;chick-a-dee-dee-dee&quot; alarm calls. During the non-breeding season, mixed species flocks may form to help with foraging and predator avoidance, and may include nuthatches, woodpeckers, kinglets, and vireos among others. These species will react when a chickadee makes the alarm call. Red-breasted nuthatch have even been observed reacting more strongly to higher-threat alarm calls, indicating some understanding of their syntax.

Black-capped chickadees make a number of other calls and sounds, such as a &quot;gargle&quot; noise usually used by males to indicate a threat of attacking another male, often when feeding. This call is also used in sexual contexts. Black-capped chickadees learn the &quot;gargle&quot; noise soon after birth and continues to develop it through to adulthood. This noise is among the most complex of the calls; in one population of chickadees, the &quot;gargle&quot; contained 2 to 9 instances of 14 distinct notes, all sung within half a second.

Social learning in particular is largely influential to the development of the &quot;gargle&quot;. Beginning 30 to 35 days after birth, strings of low-amplitude precursor or sub-&quot;gargles&quot; are produced for about a minute. At this time, they learn to produce such sounds by listening to their parents and siblings. Three chickadee populations were observed at three different sites over 8 years, and all of them produced vocalizations that were very similar to one another. Strings of juvenile sub-&quot;gargles&quot; are almost perfectly continuous and both low and unstable in frequency, yet lacking multiple syllables. When their vocal abilities are fully developed, a stable frequency is produced and a variety of syllables is heard that vary in length.

Other calls which have been noted include a &quot;broken &quot;dee&quot;&quot;, &quot;variable &quot;see&quot;&quot;, &quot;hiss&quot;, &quot;snarl&quot; &quot;twitter&quot;, &quot;high &quot;zee&quot;&quot;, and &quot;tseet&quot;. Some of these calls are used during breeding to attract a mate or reinforce a pair bond, such as the &quot;broken &quot;dee&quot;&quot; and &quot;variable &quot;see&quot;&quot;. Others, such as the &quot;snarl&quot; and &quot;twitter&quot;, are used territorially.

Black-capped chickadees in an environment with ambient noise at the same frequencies as their songs are able to adjust the frequency of their songs to effectively communicate with the surrounding population. When interacting with other chickadees close by, the males matched their frequencies; however, when the surrounding environment was noisy with other species, the males adapted by increasing the frequency of their songs. Another survey, though, showed that male chickadees sometimes intentionally match the tones of competing chickadees as a way of showing aggression. Dominant males in a population often compete with lower-ranked males, and singing contests are a way male chickadees decide who gets to mate. When a male loses a contest, particularly a higher-ranking male in the population, he will often have difficulty finding a mate.

==Distribution and habitat==
Black-capped chickadees are non-migratory and can be found throughout much of North America. They range from western Alaska, through southern Yukon and throughout the Canadian provinces, from British Columbia in the west to the Maritimes and Newfoundland in the east. The distribution continues into the United States, with its range extending to northern California in the south-west, through northern Nevada and New Mexico, continuing through the midwestern United States to New Jersey. It can also be found in the Appalachian Mountains at higher elevations. In British Columbia, the black-capped chickadee is absent on Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, Haida Gwaii, and parts of the Sunshine Coast, where it is replaced by the chestnut-backed chickadee. They are typically most common at elevations below , although they have been known to occur at up to .

Black-capped chickadees inhabit wooded areas, including both coniferous and deciduous forests, urban parks, willow thickets, and suburban areas. They do not vary their habitat between breeding and non-breeding seasons, although in the winter irregular bird migration and dispersal may occur.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Diet and foraging===
Insects (especially caterpillars) form a large part of their diet in summer. The birds hop along tree branches searching for food, sometimes hanging upside down or hovering; they may make short flights to catch insects in the air. Seeds and berries become more important in winter, though insect eggs and pupae are eaten when available. Black-capped chickadees have also been known to eat the fat off of dead mammals. Sunflower seeds are readily taken from bird feeders. The birds take a seed in their beak and commonly fly from the feeder to a tree, where they proceed to hammer the seed on a branch to open it.

Like many other species in the family Paridae, black-capped chickadees commonly cache food, mostly seeds, but sometimes insects, also. Items are stored singly in various sites such as bark, dead leaves, clusters of conifer needles, or knothole. Memory for the location of caches can last up to 28 days. Within the first 24 hours, the birds can even remember the relative quality of the stored items.

This caching behaviour has led to black-capped chickadees having larger hippocampi compared to other chickadees, who themselves have relatively larger hippocampi compared to other caching birds in the Paridae family. This variation in size also exists within the black-capped chickadee population based on the region they inhabit, with those who live in harsher climates (such as Alaska) having larger hippocampi. However, no variation exists between the sexes. The size of the hippocampus within black-capped chickadees also varies throughout the year, being the largest in October, and the smallest in February. While the exact reason for this seasonal change is unknown, it is believed that the hippocampus grows to allow the chickadee to remember its cache locations, and then shrinks as those caches are used up.
Foraging behaviour in the winter tends to decrease, primarily being affected by lower temperatures and stronger winds. In parts of the black-capped chickadee&#x27;s range with very cold winters, such as Minnesota, survival rates are affected by access to supplemental food. Chickadees with access to bird feeders in a very cold winter are twice as likely to survive than those without access to this supplemental food; months with severe weather when the temperature drops below for more than five days make the primary difference between the survival rates with and without feeders. In Pennsylvania on the southern edge of their range, with milder winters, monitoring of populations with and without feeders suggests that feeders in milder weather influence movements of chickadees but not their actual survival.

===Metabolism===
On cold winter nights, these birds can reduce their body temperature by as much as 12 °C (from their normal temperature of about 42 °C) to conserve energy. Such a capacity for torpor is not very common in birds. Other bird species capable of torpor include the common swift (&quot;Apus apus&quot;), the common poor-will (&quot;Phalaenoptilus nuttallii&quot;), the lesser nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles acutipennis&quot;), and various species of hummingbirds.

===Movement and roosting===
During the winter, chickadees often flock together. Many other species of birds – including titmice, nuthatches, and warblers – can often be found foraging in these flocks. Mixed flocks stay together because the chickadees call out whenever they find a good source of food. This calling-out forms cohesion for the group, allowing the other birds to find food more efficiently. Black-capped chickadees sleep in thick vegetation or in cavities, usually singly, though they may occasionally roost clumped together.

Their flight is slightly undulating with rapid wing beats. Flights are typically short bursts of less than with a speed around . They tend to avoid flying through large open areas and will instead be found flying along tree-lines or through forests.

Chickadees molt once a year, starting in July or August and usually taking two to three months. They do not molt in the spring prior to breeding. The postjuvenal molt at the end of the first summer of life is partial, involving only the body feathers and wing coverts. In subsequent years, the postnuptial molt at the end of each reproductive season is always complete, involving all feathers. Molting chickadees are not often seen, preferring to remain silent and hidden from view.

===Dominance hierarchy===
During the winter, the species forms flocks through which dominance hierarchies can be easily observed. Dominance hierarchies play an important role in determining the social behaviours among the birds in these flocks. Chickadees with higher social rankings have better access to food during the winter, which leads to them having a better body condition, increased territory size, and higher reproductive success. The hierarchies are linear and stable; once a relationship is established between two birds, it stays the same for many years. In general, older and more experienced birds are dominant over younger ones, and males are dominant over females. Dominant and subordinate members differ in their foraging strategies and risk-taking behaviours. Dominant individuals control access to preferred resources and restrict subordinates to foraging in novel, riskier, or suboptimal environments.
A 2011 study demonstrated that this results in subordinate individuals being less cautious approaching novel foods and objects compared to their dominant counterparts. This is similar to subordinate primates, which feed on novel food more readily than the dominant individuals because they are more used to eating suboptimal and unfamiliar food. No difference is observed in ability to learn novel foraging tasks between dominant and subordinate individuals.

===Breeding===
Black-capped chickadees start to form breeding pairs in the late fall and into the winter. In the spring, the winter flocks will disperse into the constituent pairs. Black-capped chickadees are largely monogamous during this time, although occasionally males are observed mating with multiple females. Females prefer dominant males, and greater reproductive success is closely related to the higher ranking of the male.

The black-capped chickadee nests in tree cavities above ground. The pair either excavates the hole together, uses a natural cavity, or reuses an old woodpecker nest. This species will also nest in a nest box. Nest sites are typically chosen by females, but excavation of the cavity is done by both sexes. The nest itself is built by the female only and consists of a base of coarse material such as moss or bark strips, and lining of finer material such as mammal hair. The nesting season is from late April through June, with higher-ranking females nesting before lower ranking ones. Eggs are white, with fine reddish brown dots that are concentrated at the larger end. On average, eggs are , and there are usually six to eight eggs. Incubation lasts 11–14 days and is by the female only; the male feeds her during this time. If an unusual disturbance occurs at the nest entrance, the incubating female may utter an explosive hiss like that of a snake, a probable adaptation to discourage nest predators.
Hatchlings are altricial, emerging featherless with their eyes closed. Nestlings are fed by both sexes, but are brooded by the female only (the male brings food to her during brooding, which she passes on to the young). Young leave the nest 12–16 days after hatching, in great part because the parents start presenting food only outside the nest hole. The young are still fed by the parents for several weeks, but are capable of catching food on their own within a week after leaving the nest.

Black-capped chickadees usually breed only once a year, but second broods are possible if the first one is lost. First breeding is at one year of age. Maximum recorded lifespan is 12 years, although most live roughly 2.5 years.

Black-capped chickadees may interbreed with Carolina chickadees or mountain chickadees where their ranges overlap. Interbreeding with boreal chickadees has also been documented, though it is more rare.

===Predators and parasites===
Black-capped chickadees are primarily subject to predation by birds of prey, including owls, hawks, and shrikes. Nest-predation also occurs, primarily by raccoons, squirrels, opossums, and snakes. Nest sites are also sometimes raided by house wrens, who will destroy chickadee eggs to reuse the location for their nest.

Like many birds, black-capped chickadees are susceptible to West Nile Virus. They are also known to be affected by blood parasites, including those that cause malaria, but particularly high rates of infection have not been detected. Black-capped chickadees are also known to be affected by avian keratin disorder.

==State and provincial bird==
The black-capped chickadee is the state bird of Maine and Massachusetts and the provincial bird of New Brunswick. In 2022 the black-capped chickadee was named the official bird of Calgary, Alberta. The bird is prominently featured on the standard Maine vehicle registration plate.

==Conservation==
The IUCN classifies the black-capped chickadee as least concern due to its wide distribution and large populations. While the exact population is unknown, yearly bird counts such as the Christmas Bird Count indicate that the population is increasing.

Black-capped chickadees are known to suffer from human-related mortality causes such as flying into windows or dying from ingesting pesticide. Additionally, pets such as cats pose a threat to chickadees.

<doc id="406770" wikidata="Q2309820" url="?curid=406770" title="Omake">
<text>Omake (, usually written ) means &quot;extra&quot; in Japanese. Its primary meaning is general and widespread. It is used as an anime and manga term to mean &quot;extra or bonus&quot;. In the United States and United Kingdom, anime fans generally use the term in a narrow sense to describe special features on DVD releases: deleted scenes, interviews with the actors, &quot;the making of&quot; documentary clips, outtakes, amusing bloopers, and so forth. However, this use of the term predates the DVD medium by several years. For at least the past fifty years in Japan, &quot;omake&quot; of small character figurines and toys have been giveaways that come with soft drinks and candy, and sometimes, the &quot;omake&quot; is more desired than the product being sold.

In English, the term is often used with this meaning, although it generally only applies to features included with anime, &quot;tokusatsu&quot;, and occasionally manga. Therefore, it is generally limited to use among fans of Japanese pop culture (sometimes called otaku), and like many loanwords from Japanese, &quot;omake&quot; is both the singular and plural form.

==Description==

&quot;Omake&quot; often include comedy sketches where the characters behave out of character, break the fourth wall, or subtly address opinions of the fandom known to the writers. Sometimes scenes from the TV show or OVA are humorously re-dubbed. One example, included on the &quot;Video Girl Ai&quot; DVD, replays scenes from the OVA series with new voice-acting in a rural accent. Other times, the same actors voice a new script that is more sexually suggestive, often ludicrously so. &quot;Omake&quot; can also consist of non-canonical, and often comedic crossover clips that sometimes occur at the end of episodes of two shows airing concurrently from the same studio, such as recent &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; and &quot;Super Sentai&quot; programs.
For anime, these are often presented in super deformed style, in the same way manga &quot;omake&quot; often is. For example, the anime OVA &quot;Gunbuster&quot; features super deformed characters trying to explain what the writers know to be mostly pseudo-science, or talking about their relationships with each other in a way they do not in the series itself. In the anime series &quot;Reborn!&quot;, one of the characters named Haru Miura has an interview with each of the characters of the anime in &quot;chibi&quot; forms, and the characters&#x27; answers to the questions are often something they would never say in the anime or the manga. For live action programs, although not animated, the expressions and sound effects used for comedic purposes can often be inspired by the &quot;omake&quot; found in the animated mediums.

The term &quot;omake&quot; has use also in video games; the Sega game &quot;Shenmue II&quot; for the Dreamcast had a hidden folder on the game disc labelled &quot;Omake&quot;, found by placing the disc into a computer, containing exclusive wallpapers and conception art.

Another example of an &quot;omake&quot; in popular culture is related to Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;. The secret &quot;Blackjack&quot; minigame after completion of the game is accessed by means of a button combination. The &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; &quot;Playonline&quot; site has a secrets section for &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, requiring passwords given in the official Piggyback guide to enter. The password needed to reveal the button combination for the Blackjack minigame is E-OMAKE. The minigame itself is an &quot;omake&quot;.

In some fiction writing communities based on forum sites, the term &quot;&quot;omake&quot; refer to derivative stories posted in a story thread, usually by users other than the author of the thread, and as a general rule are non-canonical by default. Members of these communities occasionally refer to having written or posted an omake with the term &quot;omaked&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Omake&quot; occasionally appears in fanfiction about anime or manga, after the story itself, usually as a humorous &quot;alternative ending&quot;. An example of this is that at the end of each episode of &quot;Dance in the Vampire Bund&quot; is a 20–30 second &quot;chibi&quot; skit called &quot;Dance with the Vampire Maids&quot;.

<doc id="406774" wikidata="Q8060298" url="?curid=406774" title="Democratic Alliance (Hong Kong)">
<text>The Democratic Alliance, previously the Yuen Long Tin Shui Wai Democratic Alliance, was a pro-democracy, pro-ROC political group in Hong Kong established in 2003 and dissolved in 2021. The final chairman of the alliance was Johnny Mak Ip-sing, who was also a member of Yuen Long District Council.

==History==
The alliance was established in 2003 by a group of pro-Kuomintang politicians under the initiatives of the Legislative Council member Albert Chan Wai-yip after he split from the Democratic Party and wanted to consolidate his political base in the New Territories West.

The group filed five members in the Yuen Long District in the 2003 District Council elections, and won three seats in the Yuen Long District Council, while Albert Chan Wai Yip himself retained his seat in the Tsuen Wan District. The Democratic Alliance became part of Albert Chan&#x27;s radical pro-democracy alliance People Power in 2011. Johnny Mak became the only People Power candidate win a seat in the 2011 District Council elections. In 2012, the Democratic Alliance broke apart from the People Power as Johnny Mak wanted to lead a candidate list in the coming 2012 LegCo elections. The group failed to win a seat in the New Territories West constituency.

<text>Interstate 505 (I-505) is a north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in the Sacramento Valley in Northern California. It is a spur auxiliary route of I-5 that runs from near Dunnigan south to I-80 in Vacaville. I-505 is primarily a rural Interstate, but travels through Vacaville and the city of Winters. The highway is the primary route connecting the San Francisco Bay Area and the northern Sacramento Valley, bypassing Sacramento and its attendant city traffic. Thus, it is a major route for travelers heading directly from the San Francisco Bay Area to the Shasta Cascade and the Pacific Northwest.

Power lines connecting Path 15 to Path 66 follow the highway for a while, until one heads northeast and the other northwest.

==Route description==
The southern terminus of I-505 is at I-80 next to the Nut Tree Airport in the Nut Tree area in Vacaville. From there, it travels north about through rural areas near the western edge of the Sacramento Valley before reaching Winters. I-505 then skirts the eastern city limits of Winters, intersecting with State Route 128—the only exit in Winters. After leaving that city, the Interstate then proceeds north through rural areas again for about until it reaches its northern terminus with I-5 near Dunnigan.

For its entire length, I-505 is a four-lane freeway (two lanes in each direction) with a maximum speed limit of , which is typical for rural Interstates in California.

I-505 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==
What is now I-505 was originally conceived as part of a loop Interstate with a directional suffix, I-5W. However, I-5W and most of the other Interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated, except I-35E and I-35W in Texas and Minnesota. I-69 segments I-69W, I-69C, and I-69E in southern Texas have since been designated as well along with proposed suffixed segments for future extensions of I-14 and I-27 to follow. The former route of I-5W now corresponds to I-580 from I-5 south of Tracy to Oakland, I-80 from Oakland to Vacaville, and I-505 from Vacaville to I-5 near Dunnigan.

The northernmost section of I-505, between SR 16 in Madison and I-5 near Dunnigan, opened in August 1977.

<text>John a Kent and John a Cumber is a sixteenth-century English play by Anthony Munday. The precise dating of the play is unknown, although a holographic transcript (dated 1590 in another hand) exists and there is some evidence that it was being performed on stage as early as 1587. The play is sometimes identified with &quot;The Wise Man of Westchester.&quot;

The precise dating of the play is important for two reasons: this play may be the earliest surviving original work of Munday, and, secondly because of the parallels that exist between this play and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Arguably the title (and the character names therein) might alternatively be taken to imply, and modernize as, &quot;John o&#x27; Kent&quot; and &quot;John a&#x27; Cumber&quot; (Cumberland having been a Scottish possession up to the twelfth century), in which case the geography of the play would also embrace those two counties. The text gives no firm indication that the two Johns do indeed come from these places, and John a Kent was also the name of a fifteenth-century Welsh bard.

<text>A lasso or lazo ( or ), also called reata or la reata in Mexico, and in the United States riata or lariat (from Mexican Spanish lasso for roping cattle), is a loop of rope designed as a restraint to be thrown around a target and tightened when pulled. It is a well-known tool of the Mexican and South American cowboys, which was then adopted from the Mexicans by the cowboys of the United States. The word is also a verb; &quot;to lasso&quot; is to throw the loop of rope around something.
==Etymology==
The word &quot;lasso&quot; seems to have begun to be used as an English word in the early nineteenth century. It may have originated from the Castilian word &quot;lazo&quot;, which is first attested in the thirteenth century in the sense &#x27;noose, snare&#x27;, and derives in turn from classical Latin &quot;laqueus&quot; (&#x27;noose, snare, trap, bond, tie&#x27;).
The rope or lasso used to restrain cattle is also called &quot;Reata&quot; or &quot;La Reata&quot; in Mexico, which was Anglicized to “Lariat” or “Riata” in the United States. In Mexico &quot;reata&quot; is basically used as a synonym for rope, a colloquialism, specifically the one used for capturing cattle and other livestock. But in its original Castilian Spanish (in Spain) definition, &quot;reata&quot; means a group of horses, mules or donkeys tied together to go in a straight line or the leading mule of three that draw a cart and, in nautical settings, a rope for binding masts and spars (woolding).

Other names are used in various countries where the Lasso is used. In Argentina, Chile and Venezuela is simply called “El Lazo” or “El Lazo Criollo” (the native lasso). In Colombia the equipment is called “Rejo”, in Costa Rica “Coyunda”, in Ecuador “Beta”, and Peru “Guasca”. Meanwhile in Colombia, the term Reata or Riata means: hardened, firm, rigid, severe; it also refers to a belt for pants.

==History==


Cattle roping from horseback originated in Hispanic America between the late 16th and early 17th centuries, although the precise origin is unknown, and developed throughout the next 200 years. Before the development of roping, the original tool of the early cowherds (vaqueros) of the Americas was the &quot;desjarretadera&quot;, a lance with a crescent moon shaped blade at one of its ends used to incapacitate cattle by cutting their hocks or hamstrings. Known in English as a “hocking knife”, “desjarretadera” comes from the Spanish prefix “des-“ meaning “to remove”, and “jarrete” meaning “hock” (dehocker); it was also known as a ”lanza de media luna” (crescent-moon blade lance) or simply &quot;luna&quot; (moon). 

A vaquero on horseback, carrying the desjarretadera, would gallop at full speed behind a wild bull and, potitioning himself slightly to one side, would hit the back, the hock, of one of its legs, slicing through the flesh and cutting the nerves, thus, incapacitating the bull. The vaquero would then dismount and finish the bull off by stabbing it at the base of its neck, and would then skin it and remove the tallow, leaving the rest to rot. This activity was done in the early stages of cattle ranching in the Americas when the only thing valuable were the hides and tallow. The desjarretadera would later on be used as a weapon used primarily by militias.

The oldest mention of anything close to “roping from horseback” in the Americas was not about cattle but about wild horses. In Friar Diego de Ocaña’s travels through the province of Paraguay in 1601, he wrote about the great quantities of wild horses that inhabited the area and how the natives would capture them on horseback, bareback, by a rudimentary roping method utilizing a rope of which one end was tied behind the horse’s &quot;brazuelos&quot; (the forearm or gaskin) while the other end was made into a noose fastened to a pole, Ocaña writes: Neither Ocaña nor other writers before or after him ever mentioned this method being used to rope cattle in that region. The method sounds similar to the Mongolian method of capturing horses using the “uurga” with the exception that the rope was fastened to the horse’s body. If this method was independently developed here or brought from the outside is unknown since there is no evidence whatsoever of its existence in Spain before the arrival of the Spanish to the Americas.

The first documented evidence of cattle roping from horseback would appear until 1643, in the book —Exercicios de la Gineta— a book about jineta horsemanship by Gregorio de Tapia y Salcedo a &quot;Caballero&quot; of the Order of Santiago. In it he describes how two Black slaves from the Americas performed an extraordinary feat in a bullring in Madrid during a bullfight. They entered on horseback each carrying in his hand a pole of 13 palmos (approx. 1.5 meters), that had one end of a rope made into a noose tied around it while the other end was fastened to their horse’s tail. As the bull was let out, the Black horsemen approached it and one placed the noose around the bull’s horns. He goes on to say that even though they sometimes failed at “roping” the bull they kept trying until they succeeded. Salcedo says that this peculiar feat caused great sensation among the people and the Royal Court indicating it was completely unknown in Spain, and continues on to say:

The precise origin of these two Black slaves who performed this extraordinary feat is unknown as Salcedo never went into detail just stating they were from the Americas (the Indies). As such, we can never exactly pinpoint where such a method originated and we can also never know how wide spread it was.

Andrew Sluyter, a social scientist and professor at the Louisiana State University, argues that roping cattle from horseback originated in Mexico. He asserts that certain ranching laws enacted by the Mexican Mesta, the government association regulating ranching, targeted Black, Mulatto Indian and Mestizo vaqueros disproportionately with harsher punishments for violating them, including corporal punishment. Due to the indiscriminate killing of female cattle and, as a result, the subsequent decline of the herds, the great set of laws passed by the Mesta in January 1574 included a law that ordered that no Blacks, Mulattos, Mestizos or Indians who are or had been employed as vaqueros were allowed to own or keep desjarretaderas and garrochas (lances), under penalty of 20 gold pesos, a 10 month salary or more for the average vaquero. For those that were unable to pay, the punishment was at least 100 lashes in public. Black and mulatto slaves fared worst since they received no salary, so the automatic punishment was lashing. According to Sluyter, black and mulatto vaqueros developed roping from horseback as an alternative way for capturing cattle, circumventing the law.

Sluyter also argues that the invention of the saddle-horn also points to Mexico as the origin of roping from horseback. According to him, the saddle with a horn for roping was the invention of these Black and Mulatto vaqueros, whose African elite ancestors knew about horns on saddles, not for roping or even herding cattle, but for hanging bags. The West African saddles, says Sluyter, look strikingly similar to the saddles developed in Mexico. The fact that there is no evidence whatsoever of the existence of horned saddles in Spain nor in any other European country, points to an African-Mexican origin. Another possible clue is that many Mexican herdsmen in the 18th century would fastened their lasso on their horses&#x27; tails, as those Black horsemen in Madrid did, a method that would continue into the 19th century in Veracruz by the Jarochos, the vaqueros of that region, who were mostly of Black descent. Although the Llaneros of Venezuela also use this method, and continue to do so, they never developed the intricate form of roping that Mexican herdsmen did.
By the 18th century, roping from horseback for the purpose of herding and capturing cattle was widely spread throughout Hispanic-America, from the Pampas in South America to the northern frontier of New Spain. The cumbersome pole once used was discarded, they were now roping more dexterously by throwing the lasso. Nonetheless, it was still very rudimentary as the herdsmen were roping in conjunction with garrochas (lances) and desjarretaderas which were still being used to drive and incapacitate cattle, respectively. One vaquero would lasso and hold a bull while another one with a desjarretadera would perform the necessary tasks. Jesuit priest Rafael Landivar vividly described in epic verse how bull hunts were performed in the Province of Mexico in 1782, stating that vaqueros would armed themselves with different weapons, some with garrochas, others with desjarretaderas and most with lassos fastened to their horses’ tails.

Also, a great deal of the roping was done on foot, including in Mexico where most of the well known roping techniques, like team roping hadn’t been invented yet. If a bull had to be captured and laid down, one vaquero had to first rope it, either by the horns or head, while another one, on foot, had to grab its tail and pull it down. Ignaz Pfefferkorn, a Jesuit missionary who visited Sonora in the 1760’s explained how the capturing and slaughtering of cattle was done at the time with roping, garrochas and tailing:

From the rudimentary roping of the 18th century, various distinct roping styles would emerge: Charro, Gaucho, Huaso, Llanero, Chagra and Montubio and Qorilazo.

*Charro: a more intricate or “refined” form of roping that implements and executes distinct loops in different situations, either for work or for simple showmanship, and it’s supported by the use of the saddle-horn to which the lasso is secured. For this reason all roping can be done on horseback.

*Gaucho: a straightforward yet effective form of roping that emphasizes speed over everything else, with no concern for the well-being of the animal. Due to the lack of a saddle-horn, the lasso is secured on the cinch underneath the saddle. This provides less stability and for this reason a large amount of the roping has to be done on foot.

*Huaso: similar to Gaucho roping, simple yet effective, limited by the lack of a saddle-horn.

*Llanero: an extremely simple and tedious form of roping, very slow, described by Scottish writer and journalist Cunninghame Graham as “not lassoing but fishing” with the rope.They’re also limited by the fact that their lassos are fastened to their horses’ tails.

*Chagra: Similar to both Gaucho and Huaso roping as they implement the same methods, even though they have saddle-horns they do a great deal of their roping on foot as they never developed and don’t use the methods used in Mexico for roping the legs such as &quot;piales&quot; (heel shots) and &quot;manganas&quot; (forefoot shots) from horseback.

*Qorilazo: Similar to the Chagra, they have saddle-horns but do a lot of their roping from horseback in conjunction with roping on foot.
===Before the Americas===

Lasso were known to the indigenous peoples of Latin America who employed them as weapons. Lassos are not only part of North American culture; relief carvings at the ancient Egyptian temple of Pharaoh Seti I at Abydos, built c.1280 BC, show the pharaoh holding a lasso, then holding onto a bull roped around the horns. Huns are recorded as using lassos in battle to ensnare opponents prepared to defend themselves in hand-to-hand combat around AD 370. They were also used by Tatars and are still used by the Sami people and Finns in reindeer herding. In Mongolia, a variant of the lasso called an uurga () is used, consisting of a rope loop at the end of a long pole.

Lassos are also mentioned in the Greek &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus; seventh book. Polymnia 7.85 records: &quot;The wandering tribe known by the name of Sagartians – a people Persian in language, and in dress half Persian, half Pactyan, who furnished the army as many as eight thousand horse. It is not the wont of this people to carry arms, either of bronze or steel, except only a dirk; but they use lassos made of thongs plaited together, and trust to these whenever they go to the wars. Now the manner in which they fight is the following: when they meet their enemy, straightway they discharge their lassos, which end in a noose; then, whatever the noose encircles, be it man or be it horse, they drag towards them; and the foe, entangled in the toils, is forthwith slain. Such is the manner in which this people fight; and now their horsemen were drawn up with the Persians&quot;. Lasso is mentioned by some sources as being one of the pieces of equipment of the Aswaran, the cavalry force of the Sasanian Empire.

In the vast majority of these cases the lassos were used as weapons for war. When used for herding purposes it was generally done on foot, typically within the confines of an enclosure, in very rudimentary ways. Other such examples include the &quot;maut&quot; or &quot;arkan&quot; lasso of the Siberian natives for herding reindeer.

==Overview==
A lasso is made from stiff rope so that the noose stays open when the lasso is thrown. It also allows the cowboy to easily open up the noose from horseback to release the cattle because the rope is stiff enough to be pushed a little. A high quality lasso is weighted for better handling. The lariat has a small reinforced loop at one end, called a &quot;honda&quot; or &quot;hondo&quot;, through which the rope passes to form a loop. The &quot;honda&quot; can be formed by a honda knot (or another loop knot), an eye splice, a seizing, rawhide, or a metal ring. The other end is sometimes tied simply in a small, tight, overhand knot to prevent fraying. Most modern lariats are made of stiff nylon or polyester rope, usually about 5/16 or 3/8 in (8 or 9.5 mm) diameter and in lengths of 28, 30, or 35 ft (8.5, 9 or 11 m) for arena-style roping and anywhere from for Californio-style roping. The reata is made of braided (or less commonly, twisted) rawhide and is made in lengths from to over . Mexican maguey (agave) and cotton ropes are also used in the longer lengths.

The lasso is used today in rodeos as part of the competitive events such as calf roping and team roping. It is also used on working ranches to capture cattle or other livestock when necessary. After catching the cattle, the lasso can be tied or wrapped (dallied) around the &quot;horn&quot;, a typical feature on the front of a western saddle. With the lasso around the horn, the cowboy can use his horse analogously to a tow truck with a winch.

Part of the historical culture of both the vaqueros of Mexico and the cowboys of the Western United States is a related skill now called &quot;trick roping&quot;, a performance of assorted lasso spinning tricks. The Hollywood film star Will Rogers was a well-known practitioner of trick roping and the natural horsemanship practitioner Buck Brannaman also got his start as a trick roper when he was a child.

<text>Probation in criminal law is a period of supervision over an offender, ordered by the court often in lieu of incarceration. In some jurisdictions, the term &quot;probation&quot; applies only to community sentences (alternatives to incarceration), such as suspended sentences. In others, probation also includes supervision of those conditionally released from prison on parole. An offender on probation is ordered to follow certain conditions set forth by the court, often under the supervision of a probation officer. During the period of probation, an offender faces the threat of being incarcerated if found breaking the rules set by the court or probation officer.

Offenders are ordinarily required to maintain law-abiding behavior, and may be ordered to refrain from possession of firearms, remain employed, participate in an educational program, abide by a curfew, live at a directed place, obey the orders of the probation officer, or not leave the jurisdiction. The probationer might be ordered as well to refrain from contact with the victims (such as a former partner in a domestic violence case), with potential victims of similar crimes (such as minors, if the instant offense involves child sexual abuse), or with known criminals, particularly co-defendants. Additionally, offenders can be subject to refrain from the use or possession of alcohol and other drugs and may be ordered to submit to alcohol/drug tests or participate in alcohol/drug psychological treatment. Offenders on probation might be fitted with an electronic tag (or monitor), which signals their movement to officials. Some courts permit defendants of limited means to perform community service in order to pay off their probation fines.

== History ==
The concept of probation, from the Latin, &quot;probatio,&quot; &quot;testing&quot;, has historical roots in the practice of &quot;judicial&quot; &quot;reprieve&quot;. In English common law, prior to the advent of democratic rule, the courts could temporarily suspend the execution of a sentence to allow a criminal defendant to appeal to the monarch for a pardon.

===United States===
Probation first developed in the United States when John Augustus, a Boston cobbler, persuaded a judge in the Boston Police Court in 1841 to give him custody of a convicted offender, a &quot;drunkard&quot;, for a brief period and to help the man to appear rehabilitated by the time of sentencing.

Even earlier, the practice of suspending a sentence was used as early as 1830 in Boston, Massachusetts, and became widespread in U.S. courts, although there was no statutory provision for such a practice. At first, judges, most notably Peter Oxenbridge Thatcher of Boston, used &quot;release on recognizance&quot; or bail and simply refrained from taking any further action. In 1878, the mayor of Boston hired a former police officer, the ironically named &quot;Captain Savage&quot;, to become what many recognize as the first official probation officer. By the mid-19th century, however, many Federal Courts were using a judicial reprieve to suspend sentences and this posed a legal question. In 1916, the United States Supreme Court, in &quot;Ex parte United States Petitioner Mandamus Judge Killets&quot; (also known as the Killets Case), held that Federal Judge Killets was without power to suspend a sentence indefinitely. This decision led to the passing of the National Probation Act of 1925, thereby, allowing courts to suspend the imposition of incarceration and place an offender on probation. 

Massachusetts developed the first statewide probation system in 1878, and by 1920, 21 other states had followed suit. With the passage of the National Probation Act on March 5, 1925, signed by President Calvin Coolidge, the U.S. Federal Probation Service was established. At the state level, pursuant to the Crime Control and Consent Act of 1936, a group of states entered into an agreement wherein they would supervise probationers and parolees who resided in each other&#x27;s jurisdictions on each other&#x27;s behalf. Known as the Interstate Compact For the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers, this agreement was originally signed by 25 states in 1937. By 1951, all the states in the United States of America had a working probation system and ratified the Interstate Compact Agreement. In 1959, the new states of Alaska and Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories of the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa ratified the act as well.

==== Probation in child support in the United States ====

When child support nonpayment was criminalized in the early 20th century, probation was the primary punishment levied on nonsupporters. Those in favor of criminalizing nonsupport wanted a penalty that &quot;would maximize deterrence, preserve the family (at least in a financial sense), and lighten the burden on charities and the state to support women and children.&quot; When New York authorized probation as a punishment in 1901, the New York City magistrates cited four benefits to probation as opposed to incarceration: &quot;(1) &#x27;Punishment without disgrace, and effective without producing embitterment, resentment or demoralization,&#x27; (2) judicial discretion to make the punishment fit the crime, (3) &#x27;[p]unishment that is borne solely by the guilty and displacing a system that frequently involved the innocent and helpless,&#x27; and (4) punishment attended by increased revenue to the City and by a saving in expense.&#x27;&quot; The existence of probation officers in child support cases made it so the state was involved in family life in previously unprecedented ways. Probation officers would often attempt to reconcile separated couples, encourage husbands to drink less alcohol, and teach wives housekeeping skills. Employing probation in nonsupport cases also led to more revenue captured by nonsupporting spouses. The National Probation Association (NPA) was instrumental in the creation of designated family courts in the United States as well, which subsequently assumed jurisdiction of nonsupport cases.

== Arming and increased authority ==

In the United States, most probation agencies have armed probation officers. In 39 states, territories and federal probation, such arming is either mandated or optional. Arming is allowed in an increasing number of jurisdictions.

Probation officers are commonly peace officers who possess limited police powers and in some instances, are employed via the court system and take on a more bureaucratic, social worker role.

== Types ==

===Intensive===
Home detention, GPS monitoring and computer management are highly intrusive forms of probation in which the offender is very closely monitored. It is common for violent criminals, higher-ranking gang members, habitual offenders, and sex offenders to be supervised at this level. Some jurisdictions require offenders under such supervision to waive their constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment regarding search and seizure, and such probationers may be subject to unannounced home or workplace visits, surveillance, and the use of electronic monitoring or satellite tracking. Under terms of this kind of probation, an offender may not change their living address and must stay at the address that is known to probation. GPS monitoring and home detention are common in juvenile cases, even if the underlying delinquency is minor. Some types of supervision may entail installing some form of monitoring software or conducting computer searches to ascertain what an offender is doing online. Cybercrime specialist in corrections, Art Bowker, noted: &quot;This is an area more and more community corrections officers are going to have to get up to speed on, learning how to enforce conditions that restrict and/or monitor cyber offenders&#x27; computer and internet use.&quot; Bowker, also observed that &quot;The use of social media is taking off in the field of community corrections&quot;.

===Standard===
Offenders under standard supervision are generally required to report to an officer, most commonly between biweekly and quarterly, and are subject to any other conditions as may have been ordered, such as alcohol/drug treatment, community service, and so on.

===Unsupervised===
Some probation does not involve direct supervision by an officer or probation department. The probationer is expected to complete any conditions of the order with no involvement of a probation officer, and perhaps within a period shorter than that of the sentence itself. For example, given one year of unsupervised probation, a probationer might be required to have completed community service and paid court costs or fines within the first six months. For the remaining six months, the probationer may be required merely to refrain from unlawful behavior. Probationers are allowed to go to their workplaces, educational institutions, or places of worship. Such probationers may be asked to meet with an officer at the onset or near the end of the probationary period, or not at all. If terms are not completed, an officer may file a petition to revoke probation.

===Informal===
Informal probation may occur with deferred adjudication, without the defendant&#x27;s having been convicted of a criminal offense, or may occur following a guilty plea pending the completion of terms set forth in a plea agreement. As with other forms of probation, terms may include drug testing or waiver of Fourth Amendment rights for the duration of the term of probation. At the end of the informal period, the case is typically dismissed. This is usually offered as part of a plea bargain or pre-trial diversion.

===Shock===
Some programs give a sentencing judge the power to reconsider an original jail sentence. The judge may recall the inmate from jail and put him or her on probation within the community instead. The courts have a theory that a short term in jail may &quot;shock&quot; a criminal into changing their behavior. Shock probation can be used only between a specific period of 30–120 days after the original sentence, and is not available in all states.

== Grant of probation ==
Community corrections officials are key personnel in helping decide whether a criminal is granted probation. They determine whether the offender is a serious risk to the public and recommend to the court what action to take. Correction officials first go through an investigation process during the pretrial period. They assess the offender&#x27;s background and history to determine whether the offender can be released safely back into the community. The officers then write a report on the offender. The courts use the report to determine whether the offender shall be put on probation instead of going to jail. After the offender is found guilty, the probation officer puts together a pre-sentence investigation report (PSI). Courts base their sentencing on it. Finally, courts make their decisions as to whether to imprison the convict or to assign him or her probation. If a court decides to grant a person probation, they must then determine how to impose the sentence based on the seriousness of the crime, , the circumstances of the convict, and the recommendations from the corrections officials.

== Violation ==
A probation officer may imprison a probationer and petition the court to find that the probationer committed a violation of probation. The court will request that the defendant appear at a show cause hearing at which the prosecutor must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed a probation violation. If the defendant pleads guilty to a probation violation, or is found guilty of a probation violation after the hearing, the officer or prosecutor may request that additional conditions of probation are imposed, the duration is extended or that a period of incarceration is ordered, possibly followed by a return to probation. No law specifies when probation violation proceedings must be commenced, although probation violation proceedings are nearly certain to occur following the defendant&#x27;s conviction of a subsequent offense or failure to report to the probation officer as ordered.

If a violation is found, the severity of the penalties may depend upon the facts of the original offense, the facts of the violation, and the probationer&#x27;s criminal history. For example, if an offender is on probation for a gang-related offense, subsequent &quot;association with known criminals&quot; may be viewed as a more serious violation than if the person were on probation for driving a car with a suspended license; the reverse may be true if the initial offense were for driving under the influence. Similarly, penalties for violation may be greater if a subsequent offense is of greater severity (such as a felony, following a misdemeanor), or if the original offense and subsequent offense are of the same type (such as a battery following an assault, or retail theft following retail theft).

=== Failing a drug test ===
Court-ordered drug and alcohol testing may be included as a standard or special condition of probation.

A failed drug test while on probation may be reported by the probation officer to the court and may result in probation violation proceedings. At the hearing a judge will determine if the violation warrants revocation of probation, incarceration, additional probation time, or other sanctions.

=== Revocation ===
When a probation violation is extremely severe, or after multiple lesser violations, a probation revocation hearing could be scheduled. A judge at the hearing will consider reports from the probation officer, and if probation is revoked, the probationer will often be incarcerated in jail or prison. However, the term of incarceration might be reduced from the original potential sentence for the alleged crime(s). It is possible that an innocent defendant would choose to accept a deferred sentence rather than incur the risk of going to trial. In such a case, a probation revocation can result in conviction of the original criminal charges and a permanent record of conviction.

== Early release ==
Judges may have the power to alter and amend the probation terms, conditions and period. Such powers are commonly held by judges in the United States. Pursuant to the authority of a court, it may be possible for a defendant to apply for early discharge from probation after some of the probation period has been completed. For example, in the U.S. state of Georgia an offender may apply for early termination of felony probation after serving at least three years of the sentence. 

In the U.S., when deciding whether to grant early discharge a judge will typically consider factors such as whether the probationer has complied with all the terms of probation, paid all fines, fees, court costs and restitution and would experience a hardship if the probation period continued.

<text>A fugitive or runaway is a person who is fleeing from custody, whether it be from jail, a government arrest, government or non-government questioning, vigilante violence, or outraged private individuals. A fugitive from justice, also known as a wanted person, can be a person who is either convicted or accused of a crime and hiding from law enforcement in the state or taking refuge in a different country in order to avoid arrest.

A fugitive from justice alternatively has been defined as a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control of the national or sub-national government or international criminal tribunal with an interest in their arrest. This latter definition adopts the perspective of the pursuing government or tribunal, recognizing that the charged (versus escaped) individual does not necessarily realize that they are officially a wanted person (e.g., due to a case of mistaken identity or reliance on a sealed indictment), and therefore may not be fleeing, hiding, or taking refuge to avoid arrest. The fugitive from justice is ‘international’ (versus ‘domestic’) if wanted by law enforcement authorities across a national border.
Interpol is the international organization with no legal authority to directly pursue or detain fugitives of any kind. Europol is the European authority for the pursuit of fugitives who are on the run within Europe, and coordinates their search, while national authorities in the probable country of their stay coordinate their arrest. In the United States, the U.S. Marshals Service is the primary law enforcement agency that tracks down federal fugitives, though the Federal Bureau of Investigation also tracks fugitives.

As a verbal metaphor and psychological concept, one might also be described as a &quot;fugitive from oneself&quot;. The literary sense of &quot;fugitive&quot; includes the meaning of simply &quot;fleeing&quot;. In many jurisdictions, a fugitive who flees custody while a trial is underway loses the right to appeal any convictions or sentences imposed on him, since the act of fleeing is deemed to flout the court&#x27;s authority. In 2003, convicted rapist Andrew Luster had his appeals denied on the basis that he spent six months as a fugitive (he was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot;).

==Terminology==
While a person is being sought for potential arrest, the person may be described variously as being &quot;at large&quot; or as a &quot;person of interest&quot; to law enforcement. The latter term is frequently used in an &quot;All-points bulletin&quot; issued to other law enforcement persons or agencies. A person who has jumped bail after arraignment in court may be hunted or pursued by his bail bondsman, and a bounty may be &quot;on his head.&quot; The act of fleeing from the jurisdiction of a court is described colloquially as &quot;fleeing justice&quot; or &quot;running from the Law.&quot; A &quot;wanted poster&quot; may be issued, especially by the FBI, culminating in the &quot;FBI&#x27;s Most Wanted List&quot; of fugitives.

&quot;On the lam&quot; or &quot;on the run&quot; often refers to fugitives. Mencken&#x27;s &quot;The American Language&quot; and &quot;The Thesaurus of American Slang&quot; proclaim that lam, lamister, and &quot;on the lam&quot;—all referring to a hasty departure—were common in thieves&#x27; slang before the turn of the 20th century. Mencken quotes a newspaper report on the origin of &#x27;lam&#x27; which actually traces it indirectly back to Shakespeare&#x27;s time.

Mencken also quotes a story from the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; newspaper in 1938 which reported that &quot;one of the oldest police officers in New York said that he had heard &#x27;on the lam&#x27; thirty years ago.&quot;

==Detection methods==
Various methods can be used to find fugitives. Phone taps and pen registers can be used on relatives. Credit card and cell phone activities and electronic transfer of money can also be traced. Wanted posters and rewards can also be used. Jail records are also sometimes used; for instance, after the U.S. Government determined that Timothy McVeigh had perpetrated the Oklahoma City Bombing, he was found in a local jail.

Other methods include using anonymous tips from members of the public who may have seen sight of the fugitive; CCTV and other modes of technology; news broadcasting of public awareness (depending on the severity of the crime the fugitive has committed), and co-operation with local law enforcement teams.

<text>Luminol (C8H7N3O2) is a chemical that exhibits chemiluminescence, with a blue glow, when mixed with an appropriate oxidizing agent. Luminol is a white-to-pale-yellow crystalline solid that is soluble in most polar organic solvents but insoluble in water.

Forensic investigators use luminol to detect trace amounts of blood at crime scenes, as it reacts with the iron in hemoglobin. Biologists use it in cellular assays to detect copper, iron, and cyanides as well as specific proteins via western blotting.

When luminol is sprayed evenly across an area, trace amounts of an activating oxidant make the luminol emit a blue glow that can be seen in a darkened room. The glow only lasts about 30 seconds but can be documented photographically. The glow is stronger in areas receiving more spray; the intensity of the glow does not indicate the amount of blood or other activator present.

==Synthesis==
Luminol is synthesized in a two-step process, beginning with 3-nitrophthalic acid. First, hydrazine (N2H4) is heated with the 3-nitrophthalic acid in a high-boiling solvent such as triethylene glycol and glycerol. A condensation reaction occurs, with loss of water, forming 3-nitrophthalhydrazide. Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group with sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), via a transient hydroxylamine intermediate, produces luminol.

The compound was first synthesized in Germany in 1902 but was not named &quot;luminol&quot; until 1934.

==Chemiluminescence==

To exhibit its luminescence, the luminol must be activated with an oxidant. Usually, a solution containing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxide ions in water is the activator. In the presence of a catalyst such as an iron or periodate compound, the hydrogen peroxide decomposes to form oxygen and water:

:2 H2O2 → + 2 H2O
:H2O2 + KIO4 → KIO3 + O2 + H2O

Laboratory settings often use potassium ferricyanide or potassium periodate for the catalyst. In the forensic detection of blood, the catalyst is the iron present in hemoglobin. Enzymes in a variety of biological systems may also catalyse the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.

The exact mechanism of luminol chemiluminescence is a complex multi-step reaction, especially in aqueous conditions. A recent theoretical investigation has been able to elucidate the reaction cascade as shown below. Luminol is first deprotonated in basic conditions then oxidized to the anionic radical, which in turn has two paths available to give the key intermediate α-hydroxy- peroxide. After cyclization to the endoperoxide, the mono-anion will undergo decomposition &quot;without&quot; luminescence if the pH is too low (&lt; 8.2) for a second deprotonation. The endoperoxide dianion, however, can give the retro-Diels–Alder product: 1,2-dioxane-3,6-dione dianion, and after &quot;chemiexcitation&quot; by two single-electron transfers (SET) gives 3-aminophthalate dianion in its first singlet excited state (S1). This highly instable molecule relaxes to the ground state, thereby emitting light of around 425 nm wavelength (purple-blue), thus &quot;chemiluminescence&quot;.
==Use in criminal investigation==

===History===
In 1928, German chemist H. O. Albrecht found that blood, among other substances, enhanced the luminescence of luminol in an alkaline solution of hydrogen peroxide. In 1936, Karl Gleu and Karl Pfannstiel confirmed this enhancement in the presence of haematin, a component of blood. In 1937, German forensic scientist Walter Specht made extensive studies of luminol&#x27;s application to the detection of blood at crime scenes. In 1939, San Francisco pathologists Frederick Proescher and A. M. Moody made three important observations about luminol:
# although the test is presumptive, large areas of suspected material can be examined rapidly;
# dried and decomposed blood gave a stronger and more lasting reaction than fresh blood; and
# if the luminescence disappears, it may be reproduced by the application of a fresh luminol–hydrogen-peroxide solution; dried bloodstains may thus be made luminescent repeatedly.

===Theory===
Crime scene investigators use luminol to find traces of blood, even if someone has cleaned or removed it. The investigator sprays a solution of luminol and the oxidant. The iron in blood catalyses the luminescence. The amount of catalyst necessary to cause the reaction is very small relative to the amount of luminol, allowing detection of even trace amounts of blood. The blue glow lasts for about 30 seconds per application. Detecting the glow requires a fairly dark room. Any glow detected may be documented by a long-exposure photograph.

===Drawbacks===
Luminol&#x27;s use in a crime scene investigation is somewhat hampered by the fact that it reacts to iron- and copper-containing compounds, bleaches, horseradish, fecal matter, and cigarette smoke residue. Application of luminol to a piece of evidence may prevent other tests from being performed on it; however, DNA has been successfully extracted from samples exposed to luminol.

<doc id="406800" wikidata="Q211939" url="?curid=406800" title="Auld Lang Syne">
<text>&quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; () is a Scottish song. In the English-speaking world, it is traditionally sung to bid farewell to the old year at the stroke of midnight on Hogmanay/New Year&#x27;s Eve. It is also often heard at funerals, graduations, and as a farewell or ending to other occasions; for instance, many branches of the Scouting movement use it to close jamborees and other functions.

The text is a Scots-language poem written by Robert Burns in 1788 but based on an older Scottish folk song. In 1799, it was set to a traditional pentatonic tune, which has since become standard. &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is listed as numbers 6294 and 13892 in the Roud Folk Song Index.

The poem&#x27;s Scots title may be translated into standard English as &quot;old long since&quot; or, less literally, &quot;long long ago&quot;, &quot;days gone by&quot;, &quot;times long past&quot; or &quot;old times&quot;. Consequently, &quot;For auld lang syne&quot;, as it appears in the first line of the chorus, might be loosely translated as &quot;for the sake of old times&quot;.

The phrase &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (1570–1638), Allan Ramsay (1686–1757), and James Watson (1711), as well as older folk songs predating Burns.

In modern times, Matthew Fitt uses the phrase &quot;in the days of auld lang syne&quot; as the equivalent of &quot;once upon a time&quot; in his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language.

==Lyrics==
The song begins by posing a rhetorical question: Is it right that old times be forgotten? The answer is generally interpreted as a call to remember long-standing friendships.

George Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Select Songs of Scotland&quot; was published in 1799 in which the second verse about greeting and toasting was moved to its present position at the end.

Most common usage of the song involves only the first verse and the chorus. The last lines of both of these are often sung with the extra words &quot;For the sake of&quot; or &quot;And days of&quot;, rather than Burns&#x27;s simpler lines. This makes these lines strictly syllabic, with just one note per syllable.

==History==

Robert Burns sent a copy of the original song to the Scots Musical Museum in 1788 with the remark, &quot;The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man.&quot;

Some of the lyrics were indeed &quot;collected&quot; rather than composed by the poet; the ballad &quot;Old Long Syne&quot; printed in 1711 by James Watson shows considerable similarity in the first verse and the chorus to Burns&#x27;s later poem, and is almost certainly derived from the same &quot;old song&quot;.
To quote from the first stanza of the James Watson ballad:
It is a fair supposition to attribute the rest of the poem to Burns himself.

The song originally had another melody, which can be traced to around 1700 and was deemed &quot;mediocre&quot; by Robert Burns. The first documented use of the melody commonly used today was in 1799, in the second volume of George Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Select Songs of Scotland&quot;. The tune is a pentatonic Scots folk melody, which was probably originally a sprightly dance with a much quicker tempo. There is some doubt as to whether this melody is the one Burns originally intended his version of the song to be sung to.

Singing the song on Hogmanay or New Year&#x27;s Eve very quickly became a Scots custom that soon spread to other parts of the British Isles. As Scots (as well as English, Welsh and Irish people) emigrated around the world, they took the song with them.

Versions of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; which use other lyrics and melodies have survived as folk songs in isolated Scottish communities. The American folk song collector James Madison Carpenter collected a version of the song from a man named William Still of Cuminestown, Aberdeenshire in the early 1930s, who can be heard singing the song on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website.

==Settings and quotations of the melody==

English composer William Shield seems to quote the &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; melody briefly at the end of the overture to his opera &quot;Rosina&quot; (1782), which may be its first recorded use. The contention that Burns borrowed the melody from Shield is for various reasons highly unlikely, although they may very well both have taken it from a common source, possibly a strathspey called &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Wedding&quot; or &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. The problem is that tunes based on the same set of dance steps necessarily have a similar rhythm, and even a superficial resemblance in melodic shape may cause a very strong apparent similarity in the tune as a whole. For instance, Burns&#x27; poem &quot;Comin&#x27; Thro&#x27; the Rye&quot; is sung to a tune that might also be based on the &quot;Miller&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. The origin of the tune of &quot;God Save the King&quot; presents a very similar problem and for just the same reason, as it is also based on a dance measure. (See the note in the William Shield article on this subject.)
In 1792, the Austrian composer Joseph Haydn arranged Auld Lang Syne as one of over 400 Scottish folk song arrangements commissioned by George Thomson and the publishers William Napier and William Whyte; his arrangement may have helped popularise the song. Ludwig van Beethoven also wrote an arrangement of Auld Lang Syne (WoO 156/11) published as part of his &quot;12 Scottish Folksongs&quot; (1814). Both of these classical versions use the original brisk strathspey rhythm.

In 1855, different words were written for the Auld Lang Syne tune by Albert Laighton and titled, &quot;Song of the Old Folks&quot;. This song was included in the tunebook, &quot;Father Kemp&#x27;s Old Folks Concert Tunes&quot; published in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1860. For many years it was the tradition of the Stoughton Musical Society to sing this version in memory of those who had died that year.

Songwriter George M. Cohan quotes the first line of the &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; melody in the second to last line of the chorus of “You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag”. It is plain from the lyrics that this is deliberate; the melody is identical except the first syllable of the word &quot;forgot&quot;.

John Philip Sousa quotes the melody in the Trio section of his 1924 march &quot;Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company&quot;.

English composer of light music Ernest Tomlinson wrote a &quot;Fantasia on Auld Lang Syne&quot; (1976), which in its 20 minutes weaves in 152 quotations from pieces by other popular and classical composers.

In the Sacred Harp choral tradition, an arrangement of it exists under the name &quot;Plenary&quot;. The lyrics are a &quot;memento mori&quot; and begin with the words &quot;Hark! from the tomb a doleful sound&quot;. Another Christian setting, using the name &quot;Fair Haven&quot; for the same tune, uses the text &quot;Hail! Sweetest, Dearest Tie That Binds&quot; by Amos Sutton. In a similar vein, in 1999 Cliff Richard released a setting of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (as &quot;The Millennium Prayer&quot;) to the melody.

British soldiers in World War I trenches sang &quot;We&#x27;re Here Because We&#x27;re Here&quot; to the tune of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.

==When sung==
===At New Year===
&quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is traditionally sung at the conclusion of New Year gatherings in Scotland and around the world, especially in English-speaking countries.

At Hogmanay in Scotland, it is common practice that everyone joins hands with the person next to them to form a great circle around the dance floor. At the beginning of the last verse (&quot;And there&#x27;s a hand, my trusty fiere!/and gie&#x27;s a hand o&#x27; thine!&quot;), everyone crosses their arms across their breast, so that the right hand reaches out to the neighbour on the left and vice versa. When the tune ends, everyone rushes to the middle, while still holding hands. When the circle is re-established, everyone turns under the arms to end up facing outwards with hands still joined. The tradition of singing the song when parting, with crossed hands linked, arose in the mid-19th century among Freemasons and other fraternal organisations.

Outside Scotland the hands are often crossed from the beginning of the song, at variance with Scottish custom. The Scottish practice was demonstrated by Queen Elizabeth II at the Millennium Dome celebrations for the year 2000. Some press outlets berated her for not &quot;properly&quot; crossing her arms, unaware that she was correctly following the Scottish tradition.

===At other times===
As well as celebrating the New Year, &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is very widely used to symbolise other &quot;endings/new beginnings&quot; – including farewells, funerals (and other memorials of the dead), graduations, the end of a (non-New Year) party, jamborees of the Scout Movement, the election of a new government, the last lowering of the Union Jack as a British colony achieves independence and as a signal that a retail store is about to close for the day. The melody is also widely used for other words, especially hymns, the songs of sporting and other clubs, and national anthems (South Korea in the 1940s, and the Maldives until 1972). In Scotland and other parts of Britain, in particular, it is associated with celebrations and memorials of Robert Burns. The following list of specific uses is far from comprehensive.

====In the English-speaking world====

*In Scotland, it is often sung at the end of a cèilidh, a dance, and at weddings. At weddings, it is performed in the same way as at New Year, but the bride and groom are often lifted up in the centre of the circle.
*The tune is played, and sung by the crowd, in the final stages of the annual Edinburgh Military Tattoo.
*In many Burns Clubs, it is sung at the end of the Burns supper.
*In Great Britain, it is played at the close of the annual Congress (conference) of the Trades Union Congress. It is also usually the final song of the Liberal Democrat Glee Club.
*The song is sung at the end of the Last Night of the Proms. Depending on whether an &quot;official&quot; performance is planned it may not be listed on the programme but in this case the audience will maintain the tradition and sing it themselves, with or without backup from the performers.
*The song is played at the Passing Out Parade of Young Officers in the Royal Navy as they march up the steps of the Britannia Royal Naval College; for Royal Air Force officers at Royal Air Force College Cranwell, and at the Sovereign&#x27;s Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst for young officers joining the British Army, as the cadets march up the steps of their famous Old College building – to the beat of the slow march, after the tune &quot;Will ye no come back?&quot;. This custom (or something very like it) is also followed in Naval and Military colleges in many other countries, especially members and former members of the Commonwealth of Nations. Examples include the Royal Military College of Canada, the Royal Military College (Malaysia), the National Defence Academy (India), the Pakistan Military Academy, Bangladesh Military Academy, Sri Lanka Military Academy, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA-India) and at the equivalent colleges in Singapore, Burma and Nigeria.
*The song is very widely used by the international Scout Movement, where it is a popular closing song for jamborees and other occasions.

====In non-English-speaking countries====
&quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; has been translated into many languages, and the song is widely sung all over the world. The song&#x27;s pentatonic scale matches scales used in Korea, Japan, India, China and other Asian countries, which has facilitated the popularity of the melody in the East. The following list of particular examples details things that are special or unusual about the use of the song in a particular country, and is (necessarily) not comprehensive.

*In France, Jesuit priest and scouting pioneer Jacques Sevin translated the song in 1920. It has become a standard farewell song under the title &quot;Ce n&#x27;est qu&#x27;un au revoir&quot; (just saying goodbye). A catholic hymn entitled &quot;Restons toujours unis&quot; was also written on the same tune. Masonic lodges use it widely too, remembering the fact that Burns was a mason.
*In Denmark, the song was translated in 1927 by the Danish poet Jeppe Aakjær. Much like Robert Burns&#x27; use of dialect, Aakjær translated the song into , a form of the Jutlandic dialect. The song &quot; is an integral part of the Danish Højskole tradition, and often associated with more rural areas and old traditions.
*In the Netherlands, the melody is used as the Dutch football song &quot; (&quot;We Love Orange&quot;), performed by André Hazes.
*In West Bengal and Bangladesh, the melody was the direct inspiration for the Bengali folk song &quot;Purano shei diner kotha&quot; (&quot;Memories of the Good Old Days&quot;), composed by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, and forms one of the more recognisable tunes in &quot;Rabindra Sangeet&quot; (&quot;Rabindra&#x27;s Songs&quot;), a body of work of 2,230 songs and lyrical poems that form the backbone of Bengali music.
*In Thailand, the song &quot;Samakkhi Chumnum&quot; (, &#x27;together in unity&#x27;) is set to the same melody. It is mainly sung after sporting fixtures and at the end of Boy Scout jamborees. The Thai lyrics are a patriotic song about the King and national unity, and many Thais are not aware of the song&#x27;s Western origin.
*In Japan, the melody is used for the song &quot;Hotaru no Hikari&quot; (The Light of the Fireflies), which has different lyrics. &quot;Hotaru no Hikari&quot; is played at many school graduation ceremonies, and at the end of the New Year&#x27;s Eve show &quot;NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;. It is played in various establishments such as bars, restaurants, or department stores in Japan to let the customers know that the establishment is closing soon.

*In Korea, the song is known as &quot;Jakbyeol&quot; (작별, Farewell) or (less commonly) as &quot;Seokbyeol-ui Jeong&quot; (석별의 정, The Feeling of Farewell). From 1919 to 1945 it served as the national anthem of the Korean exile government and from 1945 to 1948, it was the melody of Korea&#x27;s national anthem. The lyrics used then were the same as the current South Korean national anthem.
*Before 1972, it was the tune for the anthem of the Maldives (with the current words).
*In Sweden the artist Thomas Stenström made an interpretation of the song for the Swedish cancer association. The Swedish name is &quot;Ser du månen där du är ikväll? (Tillsammans igen)&quot; 

===Use in films===
The strong and obvious associations of the song and its melody have made it a common staple for film soundtracks from the very early days of &quot;talking&quot; pictures to the present—a large number of films and television series&#x27; episodes having used it for background, generally but by no means exclusively to evoke the New Year.

==Notable performances==
===Recordings===
The first recording of the song was made on wax cylinder in 1898 by the Englishmen Charles Samuel Myers and Alfred Cort Hadden, who sang it in a demonstration of the new technology whilst on an expedition to record Aboriginal Australian music with figures including Charles Seligman, W. H. R Rivers and Sidney Herbert Ray. The original 1898 recording can be heard online via the British Library Sound Archive website.

As a standard in music, &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; has since been recorded many times, in every conceivable style, by many artists, both well-known and obscure. The first commercial recording was probably that of Frank C Stanley, who recorded the song in 1910 (which can be heard above). In late 1999, an instrumental rendition by American saxophonist Kenny G reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 upon release as a single. At the time of charting it was the oldest-written song to make the Hot 100 charts. Kenny G&#x27;s recording incorporates an audio collage of sound bites taken from throughout 20th century history.

===Live and broadcast===
*1929: Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians performed it on New Year&#x27;s Eve for decades until at least 1977: The intro to Lombardo&#x27;s 1947 Decca Records version is played in Times Square every New Year&#x27;s immediately following the dropping of the ball.
*1980: Auld Lang Syne was the last song to be marched to by the Rhodesian Light Infantry in its final military parade before the regiment was disbanded.
*1997: On 30 June, the day before Hong Kong was handed over from the United Kingdom to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the tune was played by the silver and pipe bands from the Royal Hong Kong Police Force, at the departure of Hong Kong&#x27;s 28th and last British Governor, Chris Patten, from his official residence, Government House, Hong Kong. It was also later played in the British Farewell Ceremony later that night when the last British troops of the Black Watch marched away from the Tamar, Hong Kong site.
*2009: On 30 November – St. Andrew&#x27;s Day – students and staff at the University of Glasgow sang the song in 41 languages simultaneously.
*2015: On 25 March, the song was performed by a bagpiper from the Singapore Police Force&#x27;s Gurkha Contingent Pipes and Drums Platoon at The Istana as a form of respect to the late prime minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew during his state funeral.
*2020: On 29 January, the song was sung by members of the European Parliament when the Brexit withdrawal agreement was passed, ending the UK&#x27;s membership in the European Union, finalised two days later on 31 January.
*2022: On 20 February, at 21:40 CST, the song was sung in Mandarin Chinese to mark the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics closing ceremony.

<doc id="406801" wikidata="Q2713698" url="?curid=406801" title="William Habington">
<text>William Habington (4 November 1605 – 30 November 1654) was an English poet.

==Life==
Habington was born at Hindlip Hall, Worcestershire, and belonged to a well-known Catholic family. His father, Thomas Habington, an antiquary and historical scholar, had been implicated in the plots on behalf of Mary, Queen of Scots; his uncle, Sir Edward Habington, was beheaded in 1586 on the charge of conspiring against Elizabeth I in connection with Sir Anthony Babington; while to his mother, Mary Habington, was attributed the revelation of the Gunpowder Plot.

The poet received his education in Paris and Saint-Omer. The information given by Anthony à Wood in his &quot;Athenae&quot; that Habington returned to England &quot;to escape the importunity of the Jesuits to join their order&quot; rests only on a vague statement made by the ex-Catholic James Wadsworth in his &quot;English Spanish Pilgrim&quot;. He married about 1632 Lucy, second daughter of Sir William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis, the dedicatee of his first book of poems.

==Writings==
His volume of lyrical poems arranged in two parts and entitled &quot;Castara&quot; was published anonymously in 1634, and celebrated his marriage to Lucy. In 1635 appeared a second edition enlarged by three prose characters, fourteen new lyrics and eight touching elegies on his friend and kinsman, George Talbot, 9th Earl of Shrewsbury. The third edition (1640), issued for the first time in his name, contains a third part consisting of a prose character of &quot;A Holy Man&quot; and twenty-two devotional poems.

He also wrote a tragi-comedy, &quot;The Queen of Arragon&quot; (1640), published without his consent by his kinsman, Philip Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, and revived at the Restoration; six essays on events in modern history, &quot;Observations upon History&quot; (1641); and, along with his father, ‘’The History of Edward IV’’ (1640). 

Thoreau in the introspective conclusion to &quot;Walden&quot; quotes from Habington’s poem ‘To My Honoured Friend, Sir Ed. P. Knight’:

“Direct your eye right inward, and you’ll find

A thousand regions in your mind

Yet undiscovered. Travel them, and be

Expert in home-cosmography”.

<doc id="406802" wikidata="Q376835" url="?curid=406802" title="Interstate 580 (California)">
<text>Interstate 580 (I-580) is an approximately east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway in Northern California. The heavily traveled spur route of I-80 runs from US Route 101 (US 101) in San Rafael in the San Francisco Bay Area to I-5 at a point outside the southern city limits of Tracy in the Central Valley. I-580 forms a concurrency with I-80 between Albany and Oakland, the latter of which is the location of the MacArthur Maze interchange immediately east of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. I-580 provides a connection from the Bay Area to the southern San Joaquin Valley and Southern California via I-5, as I-5 bypasses the Bay Area to the east.

A portion of I-580 is called the MacArthur Freeway, after General Douglas MacArthur. Other portions are named the John T. Knox Freeway (after a former speaker pro tempore of the California State Assembly), the [[Eastshore Freeway]] (after its location on San Francisco Bay), the Arthur H. Breed Jr. Freeway (after a former California State assemblyperson and senator—the stretch itself lying between the cities of Castro Valley and Dublin), the William Elton &quot;Brownie&quot; Brown Freeway (after a Tracy resident instrumental in determining the route of I-5 through the San Joaquin Valley), the Sgt. Daniel Sakai Memorial Highway (after the Castro Valley resident and Oakland SWAT officer killed in the 2009 shootings of Oakland police officers), and the John P. Miller Memorial Highway (after the Lodi resident and California Highway Patrol officer killed while chasing down a DUI driver).

==Route description==



The western terminus of I-580 is roughly north of San Francisco in the city of San Rafael (Marin County), at the junction with US 101. The interchange with US 101 is incomplete, only allowing continuous travel from southbound US 101 to eastbound I-580 (via exit 451B) and from westbound I-580 to northbound US 101. Traffic headed the other two directions is encouraged to use Sir Francis Drake Blvd. Heading eastward through the light industrial portion of eastern San Rafael, I-580 provides access to San Quentin State Prison at the eastern tip of land before joining the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge to cross San Francisco Bay. I-580 enters the city of Richmond in Contra Costa County midspan, then continues through Richmond to join I-80 in Albany at the &quot;Hoffman Split&quot;.

After joining I-80, I-580 runs directly south for several miles along the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay in the segment known as the Eastshore Freeway, then enters the MacArthur Maze. The segment between the Hoffman Split and the MacArthur Maze is a wrong-way concurrency, meaning I-580 east is signed as I-80 west, and vice versa. From the MacArthur Maze, I-580 is known as the MacArthur Freeway, which runs through Oakland and San Leandro to Castro Valley. About halfway to Castro Valley from the Maze, is an interchange with the Warren Freeway (State Route 13). Between this interchange and Castro Valley, I-580 runs near or along the trace of the Hayward Fault, a major branch of the San Andreas Fault.

In Castro Valley, I-580 turns eastward toward Dublin Canyon before descending into Dublin and Pleasanton. After passing through Livermore, the freeway enters the Altamont Pass. The road emerges in the Central Valley west of Tracy, where, after I-205 splits near Altamont Raceway Park, it turns southeastward and terminates by merging with I-5 south of Tracy just shy of the Stanislaus County line.

I-580 through Altamont Pass is a major crossing of the Diablo Range, linking the Central Valley to the Bay Area, and also a major route to Southern California. I-580 is the only freeway that crosses the Diablo Range, making it the safest route through the mountains. Prior to the construction of this route, traffic was detoured to Pacheco (SR 152) and Polonio (SR 46) passes.

I-580 provides Interstate Highway access between San Francisco and Los Angeles since I-5 runs east of the Bay Area. However, the primary control city listed on freeway signs along eastbound I-580 between I-80 and I-205 is instead Stockton, a vestige of when this segment used to be part of US 50.

I-580 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The route is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System and is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) from the San Leandro city limits to SR 24 and from I-5 to I-205, meaning that these are substantial sections of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

==Truck ban through Oakland==
Trucks over are prohibited through Oakland between Grand Avenue and the San Leandro border. Specifically, eastbound trucks cannot travel beyond Grand Avenue/Lakeshore Avenue (exit 21B), and those going westbound must get off at MacArthur Boulevard/Foothill Boulevard (exit 30). They are instead instructed to take I-238 in Castro Valley and then I-880 through Oakland as an alternative route. The California Highway Patrol may however temporarily lift the ban for short periods to reduce traffic congestion when major accidents occur on I-880 or I-238.

The truck prohibition has been in effect since before the freeway was built in 1963 as part of US 50. Both the FHWA and Caltrans imposed the restriction, partly because the city of Oakland already had a truck ban through the area prior to the freeway&#x27;s construction. Since then, the restriction was grandfathered in when the freeway was both renumbered and added to the Interstate Highway System.

As a result, it is the only segment of Interstate Highway in California that is not part of the National Truck Network (several other California state highways have similar truck bans such as SR 2 and SR 85, but not any other Interstates). With trucks normally rerouted onto I-880 instead of I-580 through Oakland, the former generally gets more traffic than the latter. For decades, the trucking industry lobbied to have the ban removed but was unsuccessful due to local opposition. In 2000, the California State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 500, adding the I-580 truck restriction into the California Vehicle Code.

A collaborative study by the Environmental Defense Fund, Google, and the University of Texas at Austin used Google Street View cars equipped with air quality monitors to measure pollution data through Oakland. It found that along I-880, concentrations of black carbon were 80 percent higher, concentrations of nitrogen dioxide were 60 percent higher, and concentrations of nitric oxide were at least double than those along I-580. This has led community leaders to revisit the truck ban, particularly because I-880 runs along minority communities while I-580 runs through middle and upper middle class neighborhoods. Once a proponent of the ban when he served on the Oakland City Council in the 1990s, Alameda County Supervisor Nate Miley held a December 2021 virtual town hall on the issue, and asked both Caltrans and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to conduct studies on the ban. He did however concede that the California State Legislature would have to eventually repeal the aforementioned rule in the California Vehicle Code for any change to occur.

== Tolls ==
===Richmond–San Rafael Bridge===

Tolls are collected only for westbound traffic on the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge headed to San Rafael. All-electronic tolling is used on the bridge, and they can be paid by either a FasTrak transponder or license plate tolling. The high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane leading to the bridge requires a car with three or more people.

===Express lanes===
High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes along I-580 between Pleasanton and Livermore opened in February 2016. The eastbound express lanes stretch between Hacienda Drive and North Greenville Road. The westbound express lanes extend an additional west to San Ramon Road/Foothill Road.

, the HOT lanes&#x27; hours of operation is weekdays between 5:00 am and 8:00 pm; they are otherwise free and open to all vehicles at other times. Solo drivers are tolled using a congestion pricing system based on the real-time levels of traffic. Carpools, motorcycles, and clean air vehicles are not charged. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak &quot;Flex&quot; transponder with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants (1, 2, or 3+). Those with clean air vehicles need to apply for a special FasTrak &quot;CAV&quot; tag. Solo drivers may also use the FasTrak standard tag without the switch. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for free.

==History==
===I-5W and the San Francisco Bay Area===

Interstate 5W (I-5W) was originally conceived as part of a loop Interstate with a directional suffix and was what is now I-580 from I-5 to Oakland. However, I-5W and most of the other Interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated, except for I-35E and I-35W in Texas and Minnesota, and more recently in Texas, the designations of I-69W, I-69C, and I-69E, along with proposed suffixed segments for future extensions of I-14 and I-27. The former route of I-5W now corresponds to I-580 from I-5 to Oakland, I-80 from Oakland to Vacaville, and I-505 from Vacaville to I-5 near Dunnigan.

===I-5 to Castro Valley===
For the most part, the I-580 freeway in this segment was constructed over or alongside the right-of-way of US 50, previously part of the old Lincoln Highway, during the course of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The segment which begins at the split with I-205 was constructed during the same period of time over a new right-of-way to a junction with I-5 at the San Joaquin county line, running through some low hills on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley near the city of Patterson.

In the 1990s, the freeway segment from Castro Valley through Pleasanton was enlarged and otherwise reengineered in conjunction with the construction of the Blue Line of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). The BART tracks were placed in a new median between the westbound and eastbound lanes of I-580 as was the new Dublin/Pleasanton station. The interchange with I-238 and the Hayward exit ramps was also reengineered at this time.

Significant expansion to the segment between I-680 and I-205 began in 2006. Among the projects along this segment were the high-occupancy vehicle lanes in each direction, a westbound auxiliary lane between Fallon and Tassajara roads, a new interchange at Isabel Avenue in Livermore, the reconstruction of several interchanges, the construction of additional truck climbing lanes for the eastward ascent to the Altamont Pass, and plans to preserve the right-of-way to accommodate a future BART extension in the median of the freeway. In 2017, citing lack of interest from the Bay Area Rapid Transit District in bringing BART service east to Livermore, the Livermore City Council proposed a newly established local entity to undertake planning and construction of the extension, which was also recommended by the California State Assembly Transportation Committee. Assembly Bill 758 was signed by then-Governor of California Jerry Brown on October 13, 2017, formally establishing the Tri-Valley–San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority to construct and maintain the alternative Valley Link commuter rail.

===MacArthur Freeway: Castro Valley to Oakland===
The I-580 freeway in this segment was constructed starting in February 1960, adjacent to the city streets which were part of US 50 between Castro Valley and the large interchange along the eastern approach to the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge in Oakland now called the MacArthur Maze. The freeway was named in honor of World War II General Douglas MacArthur. Prior to the construction of this freeway, the various city streets of Oakland that were designated for US 50 (principally 38th Street, Hopkins Street, Moss Avenue, Excelsior Avenue, and part of Foothill Boulevard) had been renamed for the General as &quot;MacArthur Boulevard&quot; which, for the most part, still parallels the MacArthur Freeway. The renaming occurred on March 26, 1942, by a resolution of the Oakland City Council.

The freeway was opened to traffic in eight segments until its completion in May 1966 (last segment, connecting with SR 238 (now I-238), in Castro Valley, opened May 20, 1966).

===Oakland to San Rafael===
The segment of I-580 running from the MacArthur Maze to San Rafael is the most recent to be signed as I-580, beginning in 1984. Before 1984, this segment was part of SR 17.

From the Maze to the interchange locally known as the &quot;Hoffman Split&quot; in Albany, just north of the Gilman Street interchange (Hoffman Boulevard was the predecessor of I-580 in this section), I-580 follows the Eastshore Freeway, a wrong-way concurrency with I-80 for its entirety: northward on the Eastshore is signed I-80 east and I-580 west; headed southward, one finds signs indicating I-80 west and I-580 east.

At the Hoffman Split, I-580 leaves the Eastshore Freeway in a northwesterly direction through the cities of Albany and Richmond. It then crosses San Francisco Bay over the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge. The freeway in this section, officially named the John T. Knox Freeway, was constructed from 1987 to 1991. It replaced a number of city streets which comprised the earlier highway leading to the San Rafael Bridge, principally, Hoffman and Cutting boulevards.

After crossing the bridge, I-580 runs west to San Rafael, ending at an interchange with US 101. This freeway segment supplanted an earlier boulevard constructed as part of SR 17.

===Interstate 180===
Interstate 180 (I-180) was a temporary designation used in 1978 for the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge, now part of I-580. At the time, the bridge had been identified as part of SR 17 but was marked for inclusion in the Interstate Highway System.

Briefly the bridge used the number 180, despite the Fresno-area SR 180&#x27;s use of the number. The California Streets and Highways Code has a policy against using one route number for multiple noncontiguous highways. Unless the existing SR 180 is renumbered, which is unlikely due to its familiarity as the road to Kings Canyon National Park, there will not be an I-180 in California.

==In popular culture==
* I-580 features prominently throughout the &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; series. The backstory of the series establishes that &quot;First 9&quot; (SAMCRO cofounder) John Teller died in a collision on November 13, 1993, 15 years before the pilot episode takes place, and SAMCRO establishes a roadside memorial to Teller near the crash site. In the final scenes of the series finale, Jax rides his father&#x27;s restored classic motorcycle to visit that memorial, before taking a last ride on I-580.
* I-580 through the Altamont Pass is a stage in the 2011 racing video game &quot;Need for Speed: The Run&quot;.

<text>The district councils, formerly district boards until 1999, are the local councils for the 18 districts of Hong Kong.

== History ==
===Before establishment===

An early basis for the delivery of local services were the Kaifong associations, set up in 1949. However, by the 1960s, these had ceased to represent local interests, and so, in 1968, the government established the first local administrative structure with the city district offices, which were intended to enable it to mobilise support for its policies and programmes, such as in health and crime-reduction campaigns. An aim was also to monitor the grass roots, following the 1967 riots.

Under the Community Involvement Plan, launched in the early 1970s, Hong Kong and Kowloon were divided into 74 areas, each of around 45,000 people. For each, an &#x27;area committee&#x27; of twenty members was then appointed by the city district officers, and was comprised, for the first time, of members from all sectors of the local community, led by an unofficial member of the Legislative Council (Legco). The initial purpose was to help implement the &#x27;Clean Hong Kong&#x27; campaign, by distributing publicity material to local people. This was held to be a success.

A next stage in the government&#x27;s effort to increase local engagement and influence was the setting up, in June 1973, of mutual aid committees (MACs) in high-rise residential buildings. These were described in Legco as &quot;a group of responsible citizens, resident in the same multi-storey building who work together to solve common problems of cleanliness and security.&quot; In fact, they were tightly controlled by the government. With government encouragement, the number of such committees increased rapidly in these private buildings, from 1,214 in 1973 to 3,463 in 1980. The scheme was extended to public housing estates, of which 800 had MACs in 1980, as well as factories and in the New Territories.

The next development was the establishment of eight district advisory boards in the districts of the New Territories, starting with Tsuen Wan in 1977. The boards, whose members were appointed, were more formally constituted than the city district boards, charged with advising on local matters, recommending minor district works, and conducting cultural and recreational activities.

===Establishment to present===
Then in 1982, under the governorship of Sir Murray MacLehose, the district boards were established under the District Administration Scheme. The aim was to improve co-ordination of government activities in the provision of services and facilities at the district level and the boards initially took over the roles of the district advisory boards.

At first, the boards comprised only appointed members and government officials, but from 1982, a proportion of each was elected. In an attempt to inject a democratic element into the Legislative Council, the government introduced a model where some legislators were elected indirectly by members of the district councils. Twelve legislators were returned by an &#x27;electoral college&#x27; of district councillors in 1985. The practice was repeated in 1988 and 1995.

After the HKSAR was established in 1997, as part of the &quot;through train&quot;, the district boards became provisional district boards, composed of all the original members of the boards supplemented by others appointed by the chief executive. (Under the British administration, the Governor had refrained from appointing any member.)

Later in early 1999 a bill was passed in the Legislative Council providing mainly for the establishment, composition and functions of the District Councils, which would replace the Provisional District Boards. The 27 &quot;ex officio&quot; seats of Rural Committees, abolished by the colonial authorities, were reinstated. The government rejected any public survey or referendum on the issue, saying that it had been studying the issue since 1997, and had received 98 favourable submissions. The self-proclaimed pro-democracy camp dubbed the move &quot;a setback to the pace of democracy&quot; because it was a throwback to the colonial era.

In 2010, the government proposed that five legislators be added to district council functional constituencies, and be elected by proportional representation of elected DC members. In a politically controversial deal between the Democratic Party and the Beijing government, this was changed to allow the five seats to be elected by those members of the general electorate who did not otherwise have a functional constituency vote.

Under the district councillor appointment system, 102 district councillors out of 534 were picked by the Chief Executive, while the remainder were democratically elected by voters in each district. The system was abolished in 2013, and the new District Councils after the 2015 election no longer have appointed members.

In 2023, the government proposed to cut the direct elect seats of district councilors from 452 to 88 seats while the total seats cut from 479 to 470 seats. Besides, all district councilors candidate who opt for election must be vetted and passed by the new District Council Eligibility Review Committee. The proposal has been approved by Legislative Council in July 2023.

==Operation==

=== Functions ===
The councils are mandated to advise the Government on the following:

* matters affecting the well-being of people in the District;
* the provision and use of public facilities and services within the District;
* the adequacy and priorities of Government programmes for the District;
* the use of public funds allocated to the District for local public works and community activities; and

District councils also undertake the following within the respective districts with its available funds allocated by the government:

* environmental improvements;
* the promotion of recreational and cultural activities; and
* community activities

=== Councils ===

There is a district council for each of the following eighteen districts. The number in parentheses corresponds to the number shown on the map at the right.
=== Composition ===
Following revamp of District Councils announced by the Government in 2023, the number of the elected seats is significantly reduced to around 20%, while each of the 40 per cent of the seats will be returned by indirect elections and by revived government&#x27;s appointment. Single non-transferable vote replaced &quot;first past the post&quot; system, as previously implemented in the 2021 reform.

Before the drastic change, there were a total of 479 district council members in the sixth District Councils. Except 27 ex-officio seats occupied by Chairmen of Rural Committees in the New Territories, all were returned by direct election.

District Councils are chaired by District Officers starting from 2024, and had been the case in the first three years of District Boards (name of District Councils before handover), i.e. between 1982 and 1985. Since 1985 and until 2023 chairmen of District Boards are elected from amongst the members.

&quot;Source: Review of the Roles, Functions and Composition&quot;

===Political make-up of the councils===
== Independence ==
The party affiliations and politics in the Legislative Council can be echoed in the district councils, who have sometimes been accused of slavishly supporting the government. Professor Li Pang-kwong, of Lingnan University, says that the problematic framework of the councils, being under the Home Affairs Bureau, has led them to work too closely with the government. He cites the example of the &quot;copy and paste&quot; Queen&#x27;s Pier motions passed by thirteen councils to support government decisions as a rubber-stamp, and a clear sign that councils lacked independence. Li recalled a similar government &quot;consultation&quot; on universal suffrage in 2007, in which two-thirds of the councils passed a vote in support of its position. After it was revealed that the government was behind the concerted district councils&#x27; motions in 2008 supporting the relocation of Queen&#x27;s Pier, Albert Ho condemned the government for tampering with district councils to &quot;create public opinion&quot;, and for turning district officers into propagandists.

== Elections ==
=== 1999 District council elections ===

In 1999, Tung Chee Hwa appointed 100 members to the district councils. These included 41 from various political parties, namely the Liberal Party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), and the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance. No democrats were appointed.

=== 2003 District council elections ===

In 2003, Tung appointed 21 political party appointees to the district councils to dilute the influence of the pan-democrats as follows:
* eight members of the Liberal Party
* six members of the DAB
* six members from the Progressive Alliance
* one from the New Century Forum

Professor of politics and sociology at Lingnan University, Dr. Li Pang-kwong said &quot;As in the past, most of the appointees were pro-government or persons without a clear political stance... ensur[ing] that no district council is in the hands of the democrats.&quot; A spokesman for the democrats said the appointees &quot;will have an unfair advantage in that they are getting financial support from the government which will help them run for office in future elections.&quot; After this election, this election would abolish the appointed members of the Hong Kong district councils.

=== 2007 District council elections ===

In December 2007, Donald Tsang named 27 government-appointed council members.
* 13 members of the Liberal Party
* 11 members of the DAB
* three members from the Federation of Trade Unions

Tsang was criticised for not appointing a single member of the pan-democrats in either 2003 or 2007.

=== 2011 District council elections ===

After the election, Donald Tsang appointed 68 members, none of them from the pan-democrat camp.

=== 2015 District council elections ===
=== 2019 District council elections ===

=== 2023 District council elections ===

<doc id="406804" wikidata="Q2302880" url="?curid=406804" title="Unexploded ordnance">
<text>Unexploded ordnance (UXO, sometimes abbreviated as UO) and unexploded bombs (UXBs) are explosive weapons (bombs, shells, grenades, land mines, naval mines, cluster munition, and other munitions) that did not explode when they were deployed and remain at detonative risk, sometimes many decades after they were used or discarded. When unwanted munitions are found, they are sometimes destroyed in controlled explosions, but accidental detonation of even very old explosives might also occur, sometimes with fatal consequences.

For example, UXO from World War I continues to be a hazard, with poisonous gas filled munitions still a problem. Also, UXO does not always originate from conflict; areas such as military training bases can also hold significant numbers, even after the area has been abandoned.

Seventy-eight countries are contaminated by land mines, which kill or maim 15,000–20,000 people every year. Approximately 80% of casualties are civilian, with children being the most affected age group. An average estimate of 50% of deaths occur within hours of the blast. In recent years, mines have been used increasingly as weapons of terror; especially against local populations, such as in the Syrian civil war.

In addition to the obvious danger of explosion, buried UXO can cause environmental contamination. In some heavily used military training areas, munitions-related chemicals such as explosives and perchlorate (a component of pyrotechnics and rocket fuel) may enter soil and groundwater, thereby contaminating the water supply, likewise with preventing agrarian uses such as farming and food distribution.

==Risks and problems==

Unexploded ordnance, no matter how old, may explode. It might seem that the dangers of UXO decrease over time, but this is not always the case. Corrosion and damages sustained on impact might make it impossible to defuse UXO safely and also make the consequences harder to predict. Mixed explosive agents might separate or migrate over time and leave contact explosives like nitroglycerine at random places in the shell. Sometimes components of the original explosives, in the presence of moisture, can form new explosive compounds with the metals in the shells like picrates that can leave a shell highly explosive, even when it is defused and the detonator destroyed or removed.

Even if unexploded ordnance does not explode, environmental pollutants are released as it degrades. The toxic compounds and heavy metals can contaminate water and soil over time. Recovery, particularly of deeply-buried projectiles, is difficult and hazardous—jarring may detonate the charge. Once uncovered, explosives can often be transported safely to a site where they can be destroyed; if this is not possible, they must be detonated on site which might require hundreds of homes to be evacuated.

Unexploded ordnance going back as to the mid-19th century still poses a hazard worldwide, both in current and former combat areas and at military firing ranges. A major problem with unexploded ordnance is that over the years, the detonator and main charge deteriorate to such an extent, that they frequently become more sensitive to disturbance, and therefore more dangerous to handle. Construction works may disturb unsuspected unexploded bombs, which may then explode. Forest fires may be aggravated if buried ordnance explodes and heat waves, causing the water level to drop severely, may increase the danger of immersed ordnance. There are countless examples of people tampering with unexploded ordnance that is many years old, often with fatal results. For this reason, it is universally recommended that unexploded ordnance should not be touched or handled by unqualified persons. Instead, the location should be reported to the local police so that bomb disposal or Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) professionals can render it safe.

Although professional EOD personnel have expert knowledge, skills and equipment, they are not immune to misfortune because of the inherent dangers: in June 2010, construction workers in Göttingen, Germany discovered an Allied bomb dating from World War II buried approximately below the ground. German EOD experts were notified and attended the scene. Whilst residents living nearby were being evacuated and the EOD personnel were preparing to disarm the bomb, it detonated, killing three of them and severely injuring six others. The dead and injured each had over 20 years of hands-on experience, and had previously rendered safe between 600 and 700 unexploded bombs. The bomb which killed and injured the EOD personnel was of a particularly dangerous type because it was fitted with a delayed-action chemical fuze (with an integral anti-handling device) which had not operated as designed, but had become highly unstable after over 65 years underground. The type of delayed-action fuze in the Göttingen bomb was commonly used: a glass vial containing acetone was smashed after the bomb was released; the acetone was intended, as it dripped downwards, to disintegrate celluloid discs holding back a spring-loaded trigger that would strike a detonator when the discs degraded sufficiently after some minutes or hours. These bombs, when striking soft earth at an angle, often end their trajectory not pointing downwards, so that the acetone did not drip onto and weaken the celluloid; but over many years the discs degraded until the trigger was released and the bomb detonated spontaneously, or when weakened by being jarred.

In November 2013, four US Marines were killed by an explosion whilst clearing unexploded ordnance from a firing range at Camp Pendleton. The exact cause is not known, but the Marines had been handing grenades they were collecting to each other, which is permitted but discouraged, and it is thought that a grenade may have exploded after being kicked or bumped, setting off hundreds of other grenades and shells.

A dramatic example of munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) threat, is the wreck of the SS &quot;Richard Montgomery&quot;, which was sunk in shallow water about from the town of Sheerness and from Southend, still contains 1,400 tons of explosives. In comparison with the World War II wreck of the SS &quot;Kielce&quot; which rests at a higher depth, with a smaller load of explosives, it still exploded after a salvaging operation in 1967 and produced a tremor measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale.

==Around the world==
===Africa===


==== Effects of the North African campaign of World War II ====
During the fighting in North Africa between the Axis and Allied forces, much of North Africa was heavily mined to prevent military advances. During the conflict, in addition to the millions of mines that were placed, some of the millions of shells which were fired did not explode, and remain deadly to this day. Algeria, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia are all affected by this issue, with civilians being injured and killed every year. UXO also slows progress, with areas having to be demined before being developed.

==== Algeria ====
Algeria has been contaminated with large numbers of mines and UXO throughout several wars, starting from World War II. During the Algerian war for independence, French forces laid up to 10 million mines on the Morice and Challe lines, on the eastern and western sides of the country. In 2007, France officially handed over maps to Algerian authorities showing the locations of minefields. The lack of these maps had previously severely hampered Algerian demining efforts.

Further mines were laid in the Algerian civil war by both warring parties, requiring further demining efforts. However, these mining operations were not on nearly as large a scale as French operations.

By July 2016, Algeria reported that it had cleared all major minefields it had identified to clear. Thereafter, Algeria called on French authorities to provide compensation to the families of the 4000 people who are estimated to have been killed by mines, and thousands who have been left disabled from French ordnance.

==== Chad ====
Chad has been dealing with contamination issues stemming from its numerous conflicts between the 1960s and the 1980s. A significant portion of this contamination comes from the presence of anti-personnel mines, many of which are believed to have originated from Libyan sources during that period. As of 2020, estimates provided by the Mine Action Review indicated that approximately 10 square kilometers (or 3.9 square miles) of Chadian territory remained contaminated with these dangerous antipersonnel mines. Additionally, a smaller portion of unexploded ordnance (UXO) related to cluster munitions continues to affect some regions in the northern part of the country.

In recent years, the ongoing jihadist insurgency led by Boko Haram has further complicated the situation. According to the Chadian government, Boko Haram and similar insurgent groups are likely responsible for laying additional mines. These groups are also known for scavenging explosives from pre-existing UXO in order to manufacture improvised explosive devices (IEDs), making the clearance of these remnants of war even more critical for national security. Effective mine clearance and UXO removal are essential not only to reduce the threat of accidental detonation, but also to limit the availability of materials that insurgents might use for their attacks.

==== Egypt ====
Egypt is the most heavily mined country in the world (by number) with as many as 22.7 million mines as of 2024. It is estimated that 22% of Egypt&#x27;s territory is mined. These mines are from both World War II and wars that Egypt has fought with Israel. Mines contaminate large amounts of agricultural land, slowing development efforts. De-mining is a priority in the country to open up more land for agriculture purposes, oil drilling and mining. Nevertheless, Egypt stresses its need to deploy mines in order to protect its borders.

==== Ethiopia ====
Ethiopia was heavily mined in World War II, the Eritrean War of Independence, the Eritrean-Ethiopian War, and the Tigray War. The most heavily affected regions are Afar, Somali, and Tigray regions which have seen repeated conflict. A study in 2004 found that landmines and UXO affected an estimated 1.5 million people. Between 2000 and 2004, they caused 588 fatalities and 1,300 injuries.

==== Libya ====
Libya was first contaminated with UXO in World War II, in areas such as Tobruk, where heavy fighting took place. The contamination from World War II is largely unexploded ordnance and anti vehicle mines.

Libya was contaminated during its wars with Egypt and Chad, and it is also believed that the border with Tunisia is contaminated. While Muammar Gaddafi was in power in Libya, mines were placed around military facilities and other key infrastructure.

In the first Libyan civil war that began in 2011, both government and opposition forces used mines. According to the Libyan mine action centre, 30–35,000 mines were laid; however, these were largely cleared after the downfall of the Gaddafi regime by ex-soldiers. With the downfall of the Gaddafi regime, in March 2011 large ammunition depots were left unatetended, and easily accessible by the civilian population, as well as soldiers and paramilitary forces. The government did not regain control of these depots, and munitions from the same depots were spread across the country. Several of the stores also exploded, spreading dangerous ordnance over a wide area. Many military vehicles were also destroyed in fighting all across the country, and these often contained ordnance in an unstable condition.

With hostilities breaking out again in 2014, there were reports of both landmines and IED&#x27;s being laid by opposition groups, particularly in urban areas. This complicated clearance operations as these areas are often densely populated.

In 2019, clashes between the Libyan National Army (LNA) and government forces around Tripoli escalated, with the LNA surrounding Tripoli in January 2020 and launching constant rocket and artillery attacks. Both sides were also reported to be using weapons indiscriminately against international law and endangering civilian lives. Weapons such as drones from Turkey and China were used, violating the UN arms embargo placed on Libya. When the LNA forces withdrew from the east of Tripoli in June 2021, they left behind an unspecified amount of IED&#x27;s. It was reported by the UN mine action service that booby traps were left in civilian homes with their only purpose being to cause civilian casualties. In January 2020, the UN estimated that Libya was contaminated by up to 20 million mines and pieces of UXO.

The Russian paramilitary organisation Wagner which was operating in the area, also reportedly left munitions and mines in southern Tripoli. Human Rights Watch said that the Wagner Group and other militias left behind &quot;enormous&quot; amounts of ordnance. In August 2021, the BBC reported receiving an electronic tablet containing information on Wagner operators role in laying mines. Deminers in Tripoli reported finding documents in Russian in rooms that they were demining. On 24 May 2022, the Human Rights Watch wrote to the Russian foreign minister, asking to review their findings connecting with the Wagner group operations in laying mines in Tripoli, and clarify on the group&#x27;s role in the conflict. The Russian authorities did not respond.

==== Mali ====
Major contamination of Mali with UXO stems from the resurgence of conflict in 2012 Mali. Mines and IED&#x27;s were laid more heavily in the north of the country. The situation deteriorated in 2019; however, the extent of the contamination is unknown, as there has been no clear mapping of the country&#x27;s minefields.

==== Mauritania ====
Mine and UXO contamination stems from Mauritania&#x27;s 1976-78 war in the Western Sahara, while fighting against the Polisario front over the region. UXO is largely concentrated in the north of the country, around urban centres, where heavy fighting took place.

Following the urbanisation of 70% of the country&#x27;s nomadic population, urban expansion has strayed into mine belts. As many of these nomads still follow pastoral practises, valuable livestock and people can stray into contact with mines. Despite this, people are unwilling to move due to the fact that Northern Mauritania is known as the best place to raise camels. It is also difficult to precisely mark mines, due to the fact that dunes can rapidly change their location.

Although the country was declared mine free in 2018, Mauritania reported the discovery of previously unknown mined areas. As of 2023, an estimated of Mauritania was contaminated with mines.

==== Morocco ====
The contamination of Moroccan territory is a consequence of the conflict between the Royal Moroccan Army and the Polisario Front over the Western Sahara. The majority of the contamination is confined to the area around the Moroccan Western Sahara wall. All along the length of the wall (on the Eastern side) runs a minefield, sometimes claimed to be the world&#x27;s longest continual minefield. During the 1975-91 conflict, the Moroccan army used cluster munitions, unexploded bomblets still kill and maim uneducated citizens to this day.

Prior to the resumption of hostilities in November 2020, both the UN and the Moroccan army claimed to have destroyed tens of thousands of land mines, and cleared hundreds of square kilometres of land.

==== Niger ====
In 2018 Niger reported a known contaminated area near Madama military base, totalling just over . Clearance of approximately took place up to March 2020, however no clearance is thought to have taken place since then. In 2023, Niger reported that there were just under 0.2 km2 of contaminated areas near the Madama military base.

The spread of conflicts in the Lake Chad and Liptako-Gourma regions has contributed new UXO to the regions, with some insurgencies spreading to Niger. IED&#x27;s have seen increased use, some victim activated and so indiscriminate. Many of the mines used by insurgencies such as Boko Haram are used to target military convoys and vehicles, however inevitably there are civilian casualties. Between 2016 and the end of 2022, the National Commission for the Collection and Control of Illicit weapons reported 183 explosive ordnance incidents, killing 203 and wounding 204. 80% of the incidents occurred in the Tillabéri and Diffa regions.

==== Sudan ====
Sudan&#x27;s mine contamination largely stems from its civil war and other wars since the country&#x27;s independence from Britain. In 2005, a peace agreement between the rebel forces (mainly the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement) and the government brought an end to fighting, and along with it mine laying. In 2009, the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) reported that across 16 Sudanese states, contamination totalled . Despite conflict breaking out in 2011, by early 2023 it was reported that only just over of Sudanese land was contaminated with mines, and slightly more contaminated with ERW.

In April 2023, heavy fighting broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and the Rapid Support Forces, (RSF), a paramilitary organisation. The SAF alleges that the RSF has laid mines, but as of April 2024 no evidence has emerged to support that claim.

===Americas===
==== Canada ====
After World War II, much unused ordnance in Canada was dumped along the country&#x27;s eastern and western coasts at sites selected by the Canadian military. Other UXO in Canada is found on sites used by the Canadian military for operations, training and weapons tests. These sites are labeled under the &quot;legacy sites&quot; program created in 2005 to identify areas and quantify risk due to UXO. As of 2019, the Department of National Defence has confirmed 62 locations as legacy sites, with a further 774 sites in assessment. There has been controversy because some lands appropriated by the military during World War II were owned by First Nations, such as that make up Camp Ipperwash in Ontario, which was given with the understanding that the land would be given back at the end of the war. These lands have required and still need extensive clean-up efforts due to the possible presence of UXO.

====Colombia====
During the long Colombian conflict that began around 1964, a large number of landmines were deployed in rural areas across Colombia. The landmines are homemade and were placed primarily during the last 25 years of the conflict, hindering rural development significantly. The rebel groups of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the smaller ELN are usually blamed for having placed the mines. All departments of Colombia are affected, but Antioquia, where the city of Medellín is located, holds the largest amounts. After Afghanistan, Colombia has the second-highest number of landmine casualties, with more than 11,500 people killed or injured by landmines since 1990, according to Colombian government figures.

In September 2012, the Colombian peace process began officially in Havana and in August 2016, the US and Norway initiated an international five-year demining program, now supported by another 24 countries and the European Union. Both the Colombian military and FARC are taking part in the demining efforts. The program intends to rid Colombia of landmines and other UXO by 2021 and it has been funded with nearly US$112 million, including US$33 million from the US (as part of the larger US foreign policy Plan Colombia) and US$20 million from Norway. Experts however, have estimated that it will take at least a decade due to the difficult terrain.

====United States====
Unlike many countries in Europe and Asia, the United States has not been subjected to significant aerial bombardment. Nevertheless, according to the Department of Defense, &quot;millions of acres&quot; of US territory may contain UXO, discarded military munitions (DMM) and munitions constituents (e.g., explosive compounds).

According to United States Environmental Protection Agency documents released in late 2002, UXO at 16,000 domestic inactive military ranges within the United States pose an &quot;imminent and substantial&quot; public health risk and could require the largest environmental cleanup ever, at a cost of at least US$14 billion. Some individual ranges cover , and, taken together, the ranges comprise an area the size of Florida.

On Joint Base Cape Cod (JBCC) on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, decades of artillery training have contaminated the only drinking water for thousands of surrounding residents. A costly UXO recovery effort is under way.

UXO on US military bases has caused problems for transferring and restoring Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) land. The Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s efforts to commercialize former munitions testing grounds are complicated by UXO, making investments and development risky.

The area around Fort St. Philip, Louisiana is also covered in UXO from the naval bombardment, and caution would be taken when visiting the ruins.

UXO cleanup in the US involves over of land and 1,400 different sites. Estimated cleanup costs are tens of billions of dollars. It costs roughly $1,000 to demolish a UXO on site. Other costs include surveying and mapping, removing vegetation from the site, transportation, and personnel to manually detect UXOs with metal detectors. Searching for UXOs is tedious work and often 100 holes are dug to every 1 UXO found. Other methods of finding UXOs include digital geophysics detection with land and airborne systems.

=====Examples=====
In December 2007, UXO was discovered in new development areas outside Orlando, Florida, and construction had to be halted. Other areas nearby are also affected; for example boaters avoid the Indian River Lagoon, which contains UXO thought to be left from live bombing runs performed during World War II by pilots from nearby DeLand Naval Air Station.

Plum Tree Island National Wildlife Refuge in Poquoson, Virginia, was heavily used as a bombing range by pilots from nearby Langley Air Force Base from 1917 through the 1950s. The former bombing range was transferred to the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1972. Air Force records show that of various-sized bombs were dropped in just one exercise in December 1938. Because the area is alternately marshy or sandy, many of the bombs did not explode, and were partly or completely buried in mud and sand or lie in the surf just offshore. In 1958, three teenage boys who landed their boat on the island were seriously injured when a practice bomb exploded. As of 2007, the US military had not removed a single bomb from the island, which is adjacent to the Poquoson Flats, a popular destination for fishermen and recreational boaters. Signs placed offshore to warn the public of the hidden danger posed by buried UXO have not been consistently replaced after being blown down by storms. According to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the cleanup of the UXO on the island could take years and cost tens of millions of dollars.

In 1917, in response to other nations&#x27; extensive use of chemical weapons in World War I, the US Army Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) opened a weapons research laboratory and production facility at American University in Washington, D.C. CWS troops at the station routinely fired incendiary and chemical projectiles into a nearby undeveloped area that became known as &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. When the station was deactivated after the war in 1919, UXO in No Man&#x27;s Land was abandoned there, and unused projectiles and toxic chemicals were buried in deep, poorly mapped pits. Collegiate athletic fields, businesses and homes were subsequently built in the area. Chemical UXO continues to be periodically found on and near campus, and in 2001, the USACE began cleanup efforts after arsenic was found in soil at the athletic fields. In 2017, the USACE was cautiously excavating a university-owned property in an adjacent neighborhood where investigators believed that a large unmapped cache of mustard gas projectiles was buried.

Although comparatively rare, unexploded ordnance from the American Civil War is still occasionally found and is still deadly over 150 years later. Union and Confederate troops fired an estimated 1.5 million artillery shells at each other from 1861 to 1865. As many as one in five did not explode. In 1973, during the restoration of Weston Manor, an 18th-century plantation house in Hopewell, Virginia, that was shelled by Union gunboats during the Civil War, a live shell was found embedded in the dining room ceiling. The ball was disarmed and is shown to visitors to the plantation. In late March 2008, a , mortar shell was uncovered at the Petersburg National Battlefield, the site of a 292-day siege. The shell was taken to the city landfill where it was safely detonated by ordnance disposal experts. Also in 2008, a Civil War enthusiast was killed in the explosion of a , naval shell he was attempting to disarm in the driveway of his home near Richmond, Virginia. The explosion sent a chunk of shrapnel crashing into a house away.

According to Alaska State Troopers, an unexploded aerial bomb, found at a home off Warner Road, was safely detonated by Fort Wainwright soldiers on September 19, 2019.

===Asia===
====Japan====

Thousands of tons of UXOs remain buried across Japan, particularly in Okinawa, where over 200,000 tons of ordnance were dropped during the final year of World War II. From 1945 until the end of the U.S. occupation of the island in 1972, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and the US military disposed of 5,500 tons of UXO. Over 30,000 UXO disposal operations have been conducted on Okinawa by the JSDF since 1972, and it is estimated it could take close to a century to dispose of the remaining UXOs on the islands. No injuries or deaths have been reported as a result of UXO disposal, however. Tokyo and other major cities, including Kobe, Yokohama and Fukuoka, were targeted by several massive air raids during World War II, which left behind numerous UXOs. Shells from Imperial Army and Navy guns also continue to be discovered.

On 29 October 2012, an unexploded US bomb with a functioning detonator was discovered near a runway at Sendai Airport during reconstruction following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, resulting in the airport being closed and all flights cancelled. The airport reopened the next day after the bomb was safely contained, but closed again on 14 November while the bomb was defused and safely removed.

In March 2013, an unexploded Imperial Army anti-aircraft shell measuring long was discovered at a construction site in Tokyo&#x27;s Kita Ward, close to the Kaminakazato Station on the JR Keihin Tohoku Line. The shell was detonated in place by a JGSDF UXO disposal squad in June, causing 150 scheduled rail and Shinkansen services to be halted for three hours and affecting 90,000 commuters. In July, an unexploded US bomb from an air raid was discovered near the Akabane Station in the Kita Ward and defused on site by the JGSDF in November, resulting in the evacuation of 3,000 households nearby and causing several trains to be halted for an hour while the UXO was being defused.

On 13 April 2014, the JGSDF defused an unexploded US oil incendiary bomb discovered at a construction site in Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, which required the evacuation of 740 people living nearby.

On 16 March 2015, a bomb was found in central Osaka.

In December 2019, 100 buildings were evacuated to remove a World War II bomb found on Okinawa&#x27;s Camp Kinser.

On 2 October 2024, more than 80 flights were cancelled at Miyazaki Airport after a previously unknown World War II bomb detonated under a taxiway, leaving a substantial crater. No aircraft were nearby and no injuries were reported. Officials launched an investigation into what caused the bomb to suddenly explode.

==== Indian Administered Kashmir ====
Tosa Maidan, a scenic meadow in the Budgam district of Indian-administered Kashmir, was used as a military firing range by the Indian Army and Air Force from 1964 to 2014. Decades of artillery exercises left the area littered with unexploded ordnance (UXO), resulting in civilian casualties. Official records attribute at least 63 deaths and over 150 injuries to UXO explosions, though local reports suggest higher figures. In 2014, after significant public protests, the government declined to renew the military’s lease. The Indian Army subsequently initiated &quot;Operation Falah&quot; to clear the area of UXOs. Despite these efforts, sporadic explosions continue to pose risks, leading to ongoing demands for thorough demining and compensation for affected families.

====South Asia====
=====Afghanistan=====
According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, since 2001, the coalition forces dropped about 20,000 tonnes of ammunition over Afghanistan with an estimated 10% of munitions not detonated according to some experts. Many valleys, fields and dry riverbeds in Macca have been used by foreign soldiers as firing ranges, leaving them peppered with undetonated ammunition. Despite the removal of 16.5 million items since mine-clearing programmes were established in 1989 after the Soviet withdrawal, Macca and its predecessors have recorded 22,000 casualties in the same period.

=====Sri Lanka=====
According to The HALO Trust, following the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009, over 1,600,000 landmines were left in the country. Since 2009 over 270,000 landmines have been safely destroyed and 280,000 people have been able to return to their homes. Following the signing of the Ottawa Treaty, Sri Lanka has committed to clearing all known landmines by 2028.

====Southeast Asia====
=====Cambodia=====
=====Laos=====
Laos is considered the world&#x27;s most heavily bombed nation per capita. During the period of the Vietnam War, over half a million American bombing missions dropped more than 2 million tons of ordnance on Laos, most of it anti-personnel cluster bombs. Each cluster bomb shell contained hundreds of individual bomblets, &quot;bombies&quot;, about the size of a tennis ball. An estimated 30% of these munitions did not detonate. Around 30% of Laos is considered heavily contaminated with UXOs and ten of the eighteen Laotian provinces have been described as &quot;severely contaminated&quot; with artillery and mortar shells, mines, rockets, grenades, and other devices from various countries of origin. These munitions pose a continuing obstacle to agriculture and a special threat to children, who are attracted by the toylike devices.

At least 25,000 civilians have died post 1975 as a result of UXOs in Laos, with nearly half being children.

Some 288 million cluster munitions and about 75 million unexploded bombs were left across Laos after the war ended. Estimates are that present rate of defining will require nearly 100 years to clear. From 1996 to 2009, more than 1 million items of UXO were destroyed, freeing up 23,000 hectares of land. Between 1999 and 2008, there were 2,184 casualties (including 834 deaths) from UXO incidents.

UXOs continue to be a contentious issue as it has impeded infrastructure development and railway construction within the nation, including the Boten–Vientiane railway which required clearing thousands of hectares for UXO and shrapnel.

=====Vietnam=====
In Vietnam, 800,000 tons of landmines and unexploded ordnance is buried in the land and mountains. From 1975 to 2015, up to 100,000 people have been injured or killed by bombs left over from the second Indochina war. Nearly one-fifth of the land is contaminated by UXOs.

At present, all 63 provinces and cities are contaminated with UXO and landmines. However, it is possible to prioritize demining for the Northern border provinces of Lang Son, Ha Giang and the six Central provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien and Quang Ngai. Particularly in these 6 central provinces, up to 2010, there were 22,760 victims of landmines and UXO, of which 10,529 died and 12,231 were injured.

One of the most heavily contaminated province, Quảng Trị, has seen at least 3500 deaths since the end of the war and ongoing efforts will require over a decade to clear.

&quot;The National Action Plan for the Prevention and Fighting of Unexploded Ordnance and Mines from 2010 to 2025&quot; has been prepared and promulgated by the Vietnamese Government in April 2010.

===Middle East===

====Iraq====
Iraq is widely contaminated with unexploded remnants of war from the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), the Gulf War (1990–1991), the Iraq War (2003–2011) and the Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017). The UXO in Iraq poses a particularly serious threat to civilians as millions of cluster bomb munitions were dropped in towns and densely populated areas by Coalition forces, mostly in the first few weeks of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. An estimated 30% of the munitions failed to detonate on impact and small unexploded bombs are regularly found in and around homes in Iraq, frequently maiming or killing civilians and restricting land use. From 1991 to 2009, an estimated 8,000 people were killed or maimed by cluster bomblets alone, 2,000 of which were children. Land mines are another part of the UXO problem in Iraq as they litter large areas of farmland and many oil fields, severely affecting economic recovery and development.

Reporting and monitoring is lacking in Iraq and no completely reliable survey and overview of the local threat levels exists. Useful statistics on injuries and deaths caused by UXO are also missing; only singular local reports exist. UNDP and UNICEF however, issued a partial survey report in 2009, concluding that the entire country is contaminated and more than 1.6 million Iraqis are affected by UXO. More than in total are saturated with unexploded ordnance (including land mines). The south-east region and Baghdad are the most heavily contaminated areas and UNDP has designated around 4,000 communities as &quot;hazard areas&quot;.

====Kuwait====
The government of Kuwait has launched the Kuwait Environmental Remediation Program, a set of deals of the scale of US$3 billion to promote, among other initiatives, the clearance of unexploded ordnance remaining from the First Gulf War.

Kuwait has the largest amount of landmines per square mile in the world. Following the start of UXO removal, an estimated 1,486 casualties have occurred.

There are numerous mines, bombs and other explosives left from the Persian Gulf war, which makes a simple U-turn on a dirt road a life-threatening maneuver, unless performed entirely in an area covered by fresh tire tracks. Risking walking or driving in unknown areas puts oneself in danger of detonating those forgotten explosives.

In Kuwait City, there are some signs that warn people to keep distance from the broad and gleaming beaches, for example. Although, even the experts still have trouble. According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article: Several Saudi soldiers involved in mine clearing have been killed or wounded. Two were hurt while demonstrating mine clearing for reporters.

Weeks right after the Gulf, hospitals in Kuwait reported that mines did not appear to be a major cause of injury. Six weeks after the Iraqi retreat, at Ahmadi Hospital, in an area thick with cluster bombs and Iraqi mines, the only injury was a hospital employee who had picked up an anti-personnel bomb as a souvenir.

====Lebanon====
Lebanon was initially contaminated by mines during its civil war, with both sides laying mines in the conflict. During several Israeli invasions of South Lebanon, up to 400,000 anti-personnel and anti-tank mines were laid along the Blue line, the 75 mile long demarcation line drawn up by the UN to mark the withdrawal of Israeli forces.

In 2014, fighting from the Syrian civil war spilled over into Lebanon when members of the Al-Nusra Front militant group attacked the town of Arsal, after one of their leaders was arrested. Fighting ensued for several days, and improvised explosive devices (IED&#x27;s) were left behind when the militants retreated. In 2015, the al-Nusra front attacked and seized some Israeli territory, and it took until 2017 for the LBF to fully dislodge them. They left behind IED&#x27;s to harm civilians, but these were fully cleared by 2023.

During the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces used large amounts of cluster weapons. For the majority of the war, they were used to target Hezbollah rocket launch points after they were detected by radar. Civilian casualties were reasonably low at this time, as many civilians had fled or were sheltering in basement.

However, during the final 72 hours of this war, before the ceasefire, both Hezbollah and Israeli rates of fire greatly increased. It is estimated that 90% cluster bombs used during the war were used in this time. Large areas were affected. It is thought that the Israeli bomblets have a failure rate of about 40%, which is much higher compared to other weapons. For this reason, hundreds of thousands of bomblets still litter the Israeli countryside, killing and maiming people every year.

====Yemen====
Since the start of the Yemen Civil War (2014), the country has been plagued with UXOs. In 2022 alone The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), The Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (YEMAC), and the Yemen Mine Action Co-ordination Centre (Y-MACC) destroyed or removed 81,000 explosive devices, including 9,054 anti-vehicle landmines, 861 anti-personnel landmines, and 3,149 improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Which in turn entirely removed the risk, or a significant portion of risk, of death or injury from IED&#x27;s over .

===Europe===

Despite massive demining efforts, Europe is still affected to some extent by UXO from mainly World War I and World War II, some countries more than others. However, newer and present military conflicts are also affecting some areas severely, in particular the countries of former Yugoslavia in western Balkans and Ukraine. Unexploded ordnance was disposed in the baltic sea and the north sea after WWII in large quantities to a smaller extend in lakes and rivers, and still represents a threat to fishers and marine wild life.

====Austria====
Unexploded ordnance from World War II in Austria is blown up twice a year in the military training area near Allentsteig. Moreover, explosives are still being recovered from lakes, rivers and mountains dating back to World War I on the Italian Front between Austria-Hungary and Italy.

====Balkans====
As a result of the Yugoslav Wars (1991–2001), the countries of Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo have all been affected by UXOs, mostly land mines in regions where intense fighting took place. Due to the lack of awareness of these post-war landmines, civilian casualties have risen since the end of the wars. As many as 2,000 people have been killed by these landmines alone, with countless others dying due to different unexploded munitions. Many efforts made by peacekeeping forces in Bosnia such as IFOR, SFOR (and its successor EUFOR ALTHEA), and in Kosovo with KFOR in order to contain these landmines have been met with some difficulty. Landslides caused by heavy rainfall and flooding have led to migration of landmines, further complicating efforts. 

The Federal Civil Protection Administration (FUCZ) team deactivated and destroyed four World War II bombs found at a construction site in the centre of Sarajevo in September 2019.

In November 2023, a US-funded project cleared over 395 acres of mined land in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s sixth-largest city, and declared the area mine-free. As of September 2023, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Center estimates that over 200,000 acres in the country are still hazardous in contrast to the over 1 million acres considered unsafe in 1996. The US is also supporting the government in an effort to clear Brčko District by the end of 2024.

====France and Belgium====

In the Ardennes region of France, large-scale citizen evacuations were necessary during MEC removal operations in 2001. In the forests of Verdun, French government &quot;démineurs&quot; working for the &quot;Département du Déminage&quot; still hunt for poisonous, volatile, and/or explosive munitions and recover about 900 tons every year. The most feared are corroded artillery shells containing chemical warfare agents such as mustard gas. French and Flemish farmers still find many UXOs when ploughing their fields, the so-called &quot;iron harvest&quot;.

In Belgium, Dovo, the country&#x27;s bomb disposal unit, recovers between 150 and 200 tons of unexploded bombs each year. Over 20 members of the unit have been killed since it was formed in 1919.

In February 2019, a bomb was found at a construction site at Porte de la Chapelle, near the Gare du Nord in Paris. The bomb, which led to a temporary cancellation of Eurostar trains to Paris and evacuation of 2,000 people, was probably dropped by the RAF in April 1944, targeting the Nazi-occupied Paris before the D-Day landings in Normandy.

====Germany====
In Germany, the responsibility for UXO disposal falls to the states, each of which operates a bomb disposal unit. These are known as the (&quot;KMBD&quot;) or (KRD) (&quot;Explosive Ordnance Disposal Service&quot;) and are commonly part of the state police or report directly to a mid-level administrative district. Germany&#x27;s bomb squads are considered some of the busiest worldwide, deactivating a bomb every two weeks.

The presence of UXO is an ongoing task. Areas that have been subjected to aircraft bombs and artillery shells or were known battle grounds are mapped. The reconnaissance photos of the allies taken after airstrikes may show UXO and are still used to this day for location. In mapped areas New road projects, demolition, new land developments require clearing with metal detectors by the authorities to get the permits.

An estimated 5,500 UXOs from World War II are still uncovered each year in Germany, an average of 15 per day. Concentration is especially high in Berlin, where many artillery shells and smaller munitions from the Battle of Berlin are uncovered each year. One of the largest individual pieces ever found was an unexploded &#x27;Tallboy&#x27; bomb uncovered in the Sorpe Dam in 1958.

=====2010s=====
In 2011, a RAF bomb from World War II was uncovered in Koblenz on the bottom of the Rhine River after a prolonged drought. It caused the evacuation of 45,000 people from the city. While most cases only make local news, one of the more spectacular finds in was an American aerial bomb discovered in Munich on 28 August 2012. As it was deemed too unsafe for transport, it had to be exploded on site, shattering windows over a wide area of Schwabing and causing structural damage to several homes despite precautions to minimize damage. In February 2015, a British unexploded bomb was discovered near Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. In May 2015, some 20,000 people had to leave their homes in Cologne in order to be safe while a bomb was defused.

On December 20, 2016, another 1,800 kg RAF bomb was found in the city centre of Augsburg and prompted the evacuation of 54,000 people on December 25, which was considered the biggest bomb-related evacuation in Germany&#x27;s post-war history at the time. In May 2017, 50,000 people in Hanover had to be evacuated in order to defuse three British unexploded bombs.

On 29 August 2017, a British HC 4000 bomb was discovered during construction work near the Goethe University in Frankfurt, requiring the evacuation of approximately 70,000 people within a radius of . This was the largest evacuation in Germany since World War II. Later, it was successfully defused on 3 September. In the meantime, 21,000 residents in Koblenz were evacuated due to an unexploded bomb dropped by the United States.

On 8 April 2018, a 1,800 kg bomb was defused in Paderborn, which caused the evacuation of more than 26,000 people. On 24 May 2018, a bomb was defused in Dresden after the initial attempts of deactivation failed, and caused a small explosion. On 3 July 2018, a 250 kg bomb was disabled in Potsdam which caused 10,000 people to be evacuated from the region. In August 2018, 18,500 people in the city of Ludwigshafen had to be evacuated, in order to detonate a bomb dropped by American forces.

In Summer 2018, high temperatures caused a decrease in the water level of the Elbe River in which grenades, mines and other explosives founded in the eastern German states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony were dumped. In October 2018, a World War II bomb was found during construction work in Europaviertel, Frankfurt, 16,000 people were affected within a radius of . In November 2018, 10,000 people had to be evacuated, in order to defuse an American unexploded bomb found in Cologne. In December 2018, a World War II bomb was discovered in Mönchengladbach.

On 31 January 2019, a World War II bomb was detonated in Lingen, Lower Saxony, which caused property damage of shattering windows and the evacuation of 9,000 people. In February 2019, an American unexploded bomb was found in Essen, which led to the evacuation of 4,000 residents within a radius of of defusing work. A few weeks later, a bomb led to the evacuation of 8,000 people in Nuremberg. In March 2019, another 250 kg bomb was found in Rostock. In April 2019, a World War II bomb was found near the U.S. military facilities in Wiesbaden.

On 14 April 2019, 600 people were evacuated when a bomb was discovered in Frankfurt&#x27;s River Main. Divers with the city&#x27;s fire service were participating in a routine training exercise when they found the 250 kg device. Later in April, thousands were evacuated in both Regensburg and Cologne, upon the discovery of unexploded ordnance.

On 23 June 2019, a World War II aerial bomb that was buried underground in a field in Limburg self-detonated and left a crater that measured wide and deep. Though no one was injured, the explosion was powerful enough to register a minor tremor of 1.7 on the Richter scale. In June 2019, a World War II bomb, weighing , was found near the European Central Bank in Frankfurt am Main. More than 16,000 people were told to evacuate the location before the bomb was defused by the ordnance authorities on July 7, 2019. On September 2, 2019, over 15,000 people were evacuated in Hanover, after a World War II aerial bomb, weighing , was found at a construction site.

=====2020s=====
In January 2020, 14,000 residents in Dortmund were ordered to leave their homes, during the disposal of two bombs dropped by American and British forces. On August 2, 2021, 3,000 residents had to evacuate a radius of the discovery site of a unexploded bomb in Borsigplatz area of Dortmund.

On October 29, 2021, a five-year-old boy discovered a British hand grenade from World War II on the playground of his kindergarten &quot;An der Beverbäke&quot; in Oldenburg. He took it home in his backpack. The kindergarten is located on a former barracks site used by the Bundeswehr until 2007, which was converted into a residential area. On December 1, 2021, an old aircraft bomb exploded in the city of Munich during construction near Donnersbergerbruecke station.

On October 11, 2023, authorities ordered residents in Huckarde, Dortmund to leave their homes, with a radius from the discovery site of a unexploded ordnance. A month later, on November 10, a security perimeter was established in Nordhausen, following the discovery of a unexploded bomb. On April 26, 2024, authorities defused a unexploded American bomb that had been discovered two days earlier at a university expansion site in Mainz. The discovery prompted the evacuation of residents within a radius of , affecting approximately 3,500 people.

In August and October 2024, four bombs were found and safely defused in Cologne, including a 1-ton U.S. WWII bomb which was discovered during construction work in Merheim. Authorities initially tried to defuse the bomb but could only remove one of its two fuses, leading to a controlled detonation on October 11, 2024. The operation, described as the most complex since 1945, required evacuating 6,400 residents and clearing three nearby hospitals.

====Malta====
Malta, then a British colony, was heavily bombarded by Italian and German aircraft during World War II. During the war the Royal Engineers had a Bomb Disposal Section which cleared about 7,300 unexploded bombs between 1940 and 1942. UXO is still being found intermittently in Malta as of the early 21st century, and the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit of the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) is responsible for removing such ordnance. In July 2021, a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar which likely fell off a British warship during the war was discovered on a beach in Marsaxlokk and it was successfully removed by the AFM.

====Poland====
In October 2020, Polish Navy divers discovered a six-ton &quot;Tallboy&quot; British bomb. During the attempt to remotely neutralise the bomb, it exploded in a shipping canal off the Polish port city of Świnoujscie. The Polish Navy considered it a success because the divers were able to ultimately destroy the munition with zero casualties reported. The government reportedly took all necessary measures before they started to defuse the bomb, which included evacuating 750 residents from the site.

====Spain====
Since the 1980s, more than 750,000 pieces of UXO from the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) has been recovered and destroyed by the Guardia Civil in Spain. In the 2010s, around 1,000 bombs, artillery shells and grenades have been defused every year.

====Ukraine====
Ukraine is contaminated with UXO from World War II, former Soviet military training and the current Russo-Ukrainian War. Most of the UXO from the World Wars has presumably been removed by demining efforts in the mid-1970s, but sporadic remnants may remain in unknown locations. The UXO from the recent military conflicts includes both landmines and cluster bomblets dropped and set by both Ukrainian, anti-government and Russian forces. Reports of booby traps harming civilians also exist. Ukraine reports that Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast are the regions mostly affected by unexploded submunitions. Proper, reliable statistics are currently unavailable, and information from the involved combatants are possibly politically biased and partly speculative. However, 600 deaths and 2,000 injured due to UXO in 2014 and 2015 alone have been accounted for.

Since the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, both Russia and Ukraine have extensively used mines. As of the 22 July 2023, it is estimated that an area of of Ukraine are mined. The World Bank estimates that it will take $37.4 billion to clear the currently mined areas of Ukraine over a period of ten years. As of September 10, 2023, the estimated number of civilians killed by mines and unexploded ordinance is 989, and this number will increase as the conflict continues and well after the conflict has ended.

The Ukraine Mine Action Conference (UMAC2024) hosted by Switzerland and Ukraine aims to clear 10 million hectares (12.3 million acres) of land from land mines and UXO, this equates to roughly 10% of Ukraine&#x27;s arable land. Before the invasion of Ukraine, agriculture made up some 11% of Ukraine&#x27;s GDP, at the end of 2023 this figure had fallen to 7.4%. According to data presented in a Tony Blair Institute report, land mines are &quot;suppressing Ukraine’s GDP by $11.2 billion (€10.27 billion) each year — equivalent to roughly 5.6% of GDP in 2021&quot;.

====United Kingdom====

UXO is standard terminology in the United Kingdom, although in artillery, especially on practice ranges, an unexploded shell is referred to as a &quot;blind&quot;, and during the Blitz in World War II an unexploded bomb was referred to as a &quot;UXB&quot;.

Most current UXO risk is limited to areas in cities, mainly London, Sheffield and Portsmouth, that were heavily bombed during the Blitz, and to land used by the military to store ammunition and for training. According to the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA), from 2006 to 2009 over 15,000 items of ordnance were found in construction sites in the UK. It is not uncommon for many homes to be evacuated temporarily when a bomb is found. In April 2007, 1,000 residents were evacuated in Plymouth when a World War II bomb was discovered, and in June 2008 a bomb was found in Bow in East London. In 2009 CIRIA published &quot;Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) – a guide for the construction industry&quot; to provide advice on assessing the risk posed by UXO.

The burden of Explosive Ordnance Disposal in the UK is split between Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal Officers, Royal Logistic Corps Ammunition Technicians in the Army, Clearance Divers of the Royal Navy and the Armourers of the Royal Air Force. The Metropolitan Police of London is the only force not to rely on the Ministry of Defence, although they generally focus on contemporary terrorist devices rather than unexploded ordnance and will often call military teams in to deal with larger and historical bombs.

In May 2016, a bomb was found at the former Royal High Junior School in Bath which led to 1,000 houses being evacuated. In September 2016, a bomb was discovered on the seabed in Portsmouth Harbour. In March 2017, a bomb was found in Brondesbury Park, London. In May 2017, a device was detonated in Birmingham. In February 2018, a bomb was discovered in the Thames which forced London City Airport to cancel all the scheduled flights. In February 2019, a explosive device was located and destroyed in Dovercourt, near Harwich, Essex.

On September 26, 2019, Invicta Valley Primary School in Kings Hill was reportedly evacuated after an unexploded World War II bomb was discovered in its vicinity.

In February 2021, thousands of residents of Exeter were evacuated from their homes prior to the detonation of a World War II bomb; the ensuing blast blew out windows and caused structural damage to nearby homes, leaving some uninhabitable.

On 20 February 2024, a bomb from World War II was found in the garden of a residential property in Keyham, Plymouth. This prompted one of the largest evacuations in the UK since World War II, with more than 10,000 people evacuated. On 24 February, the bomb was taken out to sea and detonated, and the cordon in the area lifted.

===Pacific===

Buried and abandoned aerial and mortar bombs, artillery shells, and other unexploded ordnance from World War II have threatened communities across the islands of the South Pacific. the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement in the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs invested more than $5.6 million in support of conventional weapons destruction programs in the Pacific Islands.

On the battlefield of Peleliu Island in the Republic of Palau UXO removal made the island safe for tourism. At Hell&#x27;s Point Guadalcanal Province in the Solomon Islands an explosive ordnance disposal training program was established which safely disposed of hundreds of items of UXO. It trained police personnel to respond to EOD call-outs in the island&#x27;s highly populated areas. On Mili Atoll and Maloelap Atoll in the Marshall Islands removal of UXO has allowed for population expansion into formerly inaccessible areas.

In the Marianas, World War II-era unexploded ordnance is still often found and detonated under controlled conditions.

In September 2020, two Norwegian People&#x27;s Aid employees were killed in an explosion in a residential area of Honiara, Solomon Islands, while clearing unexploded ordnance left over from the Pacific War of World War II.

==In international law==
Protocol V of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons requires that when active hostilities have ended the parties must clear the areas under their control from &quot;explosive remnants of war&quot;. Land mines are covered similarly by Protocol II. In addition to clearance obligations, Protocol V of the CCW requires parties to record information on the use and location of explosive ordnance and to provide this data to facilitate post-conflict clearance. It also encourages cooperation and assistance, allowing affected states to request international help with resources or expertise for ERW (Explosive Remnants of War) removal. Protocol V aims to reduce the long-term dangers posed by unexploded munitions to civilians and supports safer post-conflict recovery.

The Ottawa Treaty, signed in 1997 by 122 countries and effective in 1999, sought to eliminate anti-personnel landmines. It prohibits use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of Anti-personnel mines and mandates affected countries to clear mined areas within 10 years. While the treaty does not cover UXO (unexploded ordinance) directly, its principles indirectly influence UXO management, with clearance, victim assistance, and transparency obligations encouraging similar actions for UXO. Over 160 countries are now parties, with major non-signatories including the United States, China, and Russia.

The Geneva Conventions and International humanitarian law address UXO indirectly through principles focused on civilian protection. Under Protocol I (1977), parties to a conflict are required to take precautions to minimize harm to civilians, which includes managing the risks posed by UXO with an emphasis on preventing long-term civilian casualties.

==Detection technology==
Many weapons, including aerial bombs in particular, are discovered during construction work, after lying undetected for decades. Having failed to explode while resting undiscovered is no guarantee that a bomb will not explode when disturbed. Such discoveries are common in heavily bombed cities, without a serious enough threat to warrant systematic searching.

Where there is known to be much unexploded ordnance, in cases of unexploded subsoil ordnance a remote investigation is done by visual interpretation of available historical aerial photographs. Modern techniques can combine geophysical and survey methods with modern electromagnetic and magnetic detectors. This provides digital mapping of UXO contamination with the aim to better target subsequent excavations, reducing the cost of digging on every metallic contact and speeding the clearance process. Magnetometer probes can detect UXO and provide geotechnical data before drilling or piling is carried out.

In the U.S., the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) Department of Defense programs fund research into the detection and discrimination of UXO from scrap metal. Much of the cost of UXO removal comes from removing non-explosive items that the metal detectors have identified, so improved discrimination is critical. New techniques such as shape reconstruction from magnetic data and better de-noising techniques will reduce cleanup costs and enhance recovery.
The Interstate Technology &amp; Regulatory Council published a Geophysical Classification for Munitions Response guidance document in August 2015.
UXO or UXBs (as they are called in some countries – unexploded bombs) are broadly classified into buried and unburied. The disposal team carries out reconnaissance of the area and determines the location of the ordnance. If is not buried it may be dug up carefully and disposed of. But if the bomb is buried it becomes a huge task. A team is formed to find the location of the bomb using metal detectors and then the earth is dug carefully.

==Effects post-conflict==
There are a variety of effects unexploded ordnance contamination has on post-conflict societies other than physical harm from detonation. Segments of society which are also negatively affected include foreign direct investment, education, aid distribution, industrialization, and the environment.

===Industrialisation===
UXO presence reduces farming communities’ ability to use industrial machinery due to higher likelihood of triggering a buried munition. As well as this, large scale infrastructure projects such as road, rail, dam, or bridge building which require heavy machinery are prevented due to the risk of setting off UXO. These two factors in turn reduce road building and therefore prevent other more remote communities from industrializing themselves

===Aid distribution===
Contaminated areas experience more difficulties in providing humanitarian aid to rural or remote communities. Infrastructure for transportation is either impossible to develop, or preexisting infrastructure is difficult to demine.

===Environmental effects===
Demining procedures destroy topsoil. This causes increased erosion and can reduce the fertility of arable land.

Munitions which are left over a long period of time degrade and eventually poison the soil or groundwater around them.

===Education===
The inhibition of necessary resources correlates with decreases in education. Injuries experienced by older members of the community take children away from classrooms to support a family&#x27;s subsistence agriculture techniques.

===Foreign direct investment===
Foreign direct investment from more developed nations is discouraged due to difficulty in clearing contaminated areas

<text>Tannaim (Amoraic Hebrew: תנאים &quot;repeaters&quot;, &quot;teachers&quot;, singular &quot;tanna&quot; , borrowed from Aramaic) were the rabbinic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah, from approximately 10–220 CE. The period of the Tannaim, also referred to as the Mishnaic period, lasted about 210 years. It came after the period of the Zugot &quot;Pairs&quot; and was immediately followed by the period of the Amoraim &quot;Interpreters&quot;.

The root &quot;tanna&quot; () is the Aramaic equivalent of the Hebrew root &quot;shanah&quot; (), which also is the root word of &quot;Mishnah&quot;. The verb &quot;shanah&quot; means &quot;to repeat [what one was taught]&quot; and is used to mean &quot;to learn&quot;.

The Mishnaic period is commonly divided into five periods according to generations. There are approximately 120 known Tannaim.

The Tannaim lived in several areas of the Land of Israel. The spiritual center of Judaism at that time was Jerusalem, but after the destruction of the city and the Second Temple, Yohanan ben Zakkai and his students founded a new Council of Jamnia. Other places of learning were founded by his students in Lod and in Bnei Brak.

Some Tannaim worked as laborers (e.g., charcoal burners, cobblers) in addition to their positions as teachers and legislators. They were also leaders of the people and negotiators with the Roman Empire.
== History==
The &quot;Tannaim&quot; operated under the occupation of the Roman Empire. During this time, the &quot;Kohanim&quot; (priests) of the Temple became increasingly corrupt and were seen by the Jews as collaborators with the Romans, whose mismanagement of Iudaea province (composed of Samaria, Idumea and Judea proper) led to riots, revolts and general resentment. 

Until the days of Hillel and Shammai, the last generation of the Zugot, there were few disagreements among Rabbinic scholars. After this period, though, the Houses of Hillel and Shammai came to represent two distinct perspectives on Jewish law, and disagreements between the two schools of thought are found throughout the Mishnah.

The &quot;Tannaim&quot;, as teachers of the Oral Law, are said to be direct transmitters of an oral tradition passed from teacher to student that was written and codified as the basis for the Mishnah, Tosefta, and tannaitic teachings of the Talmud. According to rabbinic tradition, the &quot;Tannaim&quot; were the last generation in a long sequence of oral teachers that began with Moses.

== Language of the Mishnah ==
The language in which the Tannaim of Israel and Babylonia wrote is referred to as Mishnaic Hebrew (MH), or in Hebrew &quot;Lešon hakhamim&quot;, meaning &quot;the language of the Sages.&quot; Texts were written in MH between roughly 70 CE and 500 CE. Tannaitic literature, which includes the Mishnah, the Tosefta, the halachic midrashim, and Seder &#x27;olam Rabba was redacted between roughly 70 CE to 250 CE. Research has demonstrated that Hebrew was spoken in Israel until about 200 CE, and it is generally agreed that tannaitic literature reflects the language and speech used in various regions of Israel during that time period.

== Prominent &quot;Tannaim&quot; ==
=== Titles ===
The &quot;Nasi&quot; (plural &quot;Nesi&#x27;im&quot;) was the highest-ranking member and presided over the Sanhedrin. &quot;Rabban&quot; was a higher title than &quot;Rabbi&quot;, and it was given to the &quot;Nasi&quot; starting with Rabban Gamaliel Hazaken (Gamaliel the Elder). The title &quot;Rabban&quot; was limited to the descendants of Hillel, the sole exception being Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai, the leader in Jerusalem during the siege, who safeguarded the future of the Jewish people after the Great Revolt by pleading with Vespasian. Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah, who was also &quot;Nasi&quot;, was not given the title &quot;Rabban&quot;, perhaps because he only held the position of &quot;Nasi&quot; for a short while and it eventually reverted to the descendants of Hillel. Prior to Rabban Gamliel Hazaken, no titles were used before someone&#x27;s name, which gave rise to the Talmudic adage &quot;Gadol miRabban shmo&quot; (&quot;Greater than the title &quot;Rabban&quot; is a person&#x27;s own name&quot;). This is seen as the reason that Hillel has no title before his name: his name in itself is his title, just as Moses and Abraham have no titles before their names. (An addition is sometimes given &quot;after&quot; a name to denote significance or to differentiate between two people with the same name. Examples include &quot;Avraham Avinu&quot; (Abraham our father) and &quot;Moshe Rabbeinu&quot; (Moses our teacher). Similarly, Hillel is often referred to as &quot;Hillel Hazaken&quot; (Hillel the elder). Starting with Rabbi Judah haNasi (Judah the &quot;Nasi&quot;), often referred to simply as &quot;Rabbi&quot;, not even the &quot;Nasi&quot; is given the title &quot;Rabban&quot;, but instead, Judah haNasi is given the lofty title &quot;Rabbeinu HaKadosh&quot; (&quot;Our holy rabbi [teacher]&quot;).

===Generations===
The Mishnaic period is commonly divided into five generations, listed below:
#First Generation before and shortly after the Destruction of the Temple (c. 40 BCE – 80 CE):&lt;br&gt;Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, Shimon ben Gamliel and Judah ben Baba
#Second Generation between the destruction of the Temple and Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt:&lt;br&gt;Rabban Gamaliel II of Yavneh, Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah and Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus, the teachers of Rabbi Akiva, as well as Gamaliel of Yavne and Eleazar ben Arach
#Third Generation around Bar Kochba&#x27;s revolt:&lt;br&gt;Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi Tarfon, Ishmael ben Elisha, Eleazar ben Azariah, Jose the Galilean, Nathan the Babylonian and Elisha ben Abuyah (the &quot;Other&quot; or apostate)
#Fourth Generation after the revolt:&lt;br&gt;Shimon ben Gamliel of Yavne, Rabbi Meir, Shimon bar Yochai (who, according to traditional lore, wrote the Zohar), Jose ben Halafta, Yehuda ben Ilai and Rabbi Nehemiah
#Fifth Generation: the generation of Rabbi Judah haNasi, who compiled the Mishnah.
#Sixth Generation, an interim generation between the Mishnah and the Gemara:&lt;br&gt; Rabbi Hiyya, Shimon ben Judah HaNasi and Yehoshua ben Levi.

<doc id="406810" wikidata="Q1890261" url="?curid=406810" title="Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race">
<text>The Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race is an annual oceanic yacht racing event hosted by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, starting in Sydney, New South Wales, on Boxing Day and finishing in Hobart, Tasmania. The race distance is approximately . The race is run in conjunction with the Royal Yacht Club of Tasmania, and is widely considered to be one of the most difficult yacht races in the world.

The race was initially planned to be a cruise by Peter Luke and some friends who had formed a club for those who enjoyed cruising as opposed to racing; however, when a visiting British Royal Navy Officer, Captain John Illingworth, suggested it be made a race, the event was born. Since the inaugural race in 1945, the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race has grown over the decades to become one of the top three offshore yacht races in the world, and it now attracts maxi yachts from all around the globe. The 2019 race was the 75th edition.

Australia&#x27;s foremost offshore sailing prize is The George Adams Tattersall Cup, awarded to the ultimate winner of the handicap competition based on the length, shape, weight and sail dimensions of the yacht. Much public attention however, focuses on the race for &quot;line honours&quot; – the first boat across the finishing line, typically the newest and largest Maxi yacht in the fleet.

Along with the Newport-Bermuda Race and the Fastnet Race, it is considered one of the classic big offshore races with each distance approximately .

In 2017, &quot;LDV Comanche&quot; set a new race record finishing in 1 day, 9 hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds, beating &quot;Perpetual Loyal&#x27;s&quot; record of 1 day, 13 hours, 31 minutes and 20 seconds, set the previous year. &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot;, who crossed the line first, received a 1-hour penalty for her role in a near-miss collision at the beginning of the race and disregard of the starboard rule, handing &quot;LDV Comanche&quot; line honours. &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; completed the course in an unofficial record time of 1 day, 08 hours, 48 minutes and 50 seconds.

&quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; has won line honours on 9 separate occasions (2005–2008, 2010, 2012–2014, 2018) and is the first boat to have claimed the treble – race record, line honours and overall winner.

==History==

The Bass Strait, and the waters of the Pacific Ocean immediately to its east are renowned for their high winds and difficult seas. Although the race mostly takes place in the Tasman Sea, the shallowness of Bass Strait and the proximity to the race course means that the fleet is very much under the influence of the Strait as they transit from the mainland to Flinders Island. Even though the race is held in the Australian summer, southerly buster storms often make the Sydney–Hobart race cold, bumpy, and very challenging for the crew. It is typical for a considerable number of yachts to retire, often at Eden on the New South Wales south coast, the last sheltered harbour before Flinders Island.

The first Sydney to Hobart race was held in 1945. The race was initially planned to be a cruise by Peter Luke and some friends who had formed a club for those who enjoyed cruising as opposed to racing; however, when a visiting British Royal Navy Officer, Captain John Illingworth, suggested it be made a race, the event was born. The inaugural race had nine starters, including the &quot;Kathleen Gillett,&quot; captained by renowned marine artist Jack Earl. John Illingworth&#x27;s &quot;Rani&quot;, built at Speers Point was the winner, taking six days, 14 hours and 22 minutes. Race records for the fastest (elapsed) time dropped rapidly. However, it took 21 years for the 1975 record by &quot;Kialoa&quot; from the United States to be broken by the German yacht &quot;Morning Glory&quot; in 1996, and then only by a dramatic 29 minutes, as she tacked up the River Derwent against the clock. In 1999 Denmark&#x27;s &quot;Nokia&quot; sailed the course in one day, 19 hours, 48 minutes and two seconds, a record which stood until 2005 when &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; won line and handicap honours in 1 day 18 hr 40 min 10 sec.

There have been some notable achievements by yachts over the years. Sydney yacht, &quot;Morna&quot;, won the second, third and fourth races (1946–1948) and then, under new owners Frank and John Livingston from Victoria, took a further four titles as &quot;Kurrewa IV&quot; in 1954, 1956, 1957 and 1960. Other yachts to win three or more titles are Astor (1961, 1963 and 1964) and &quot;Bumblebee IV&quot; firstly in 1979 and then again in 1988 and 1990 as &quot;Ragamuffin&quot;. When &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; won back-to-back titles in 2006, it was the first yacht to do so since &quot;Astor&quot; in the 1960s. &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; claimed its third consecutive line honours title in the 2007 race, re-writing history by being only the second yacht after &quot;Rani&quot; in the inaugural 1945 race to win line and handicap honours and break the race record in the same year (2005) and then only the second yacht after &quot;Morna&quot; to win three line honours titles in a row. In 2008, &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; broke &quot;Morna&quot;&#x27;s long-standing record of three titles in a row, by completing a four-in-a-row, the first yacht to achieve that remarkable achievement.
For the handicap race the highly respected Halvorsen brothers&#x27; &quot;Freya&quot; won three titles back-to-back (the only yacht in history to do so) between 1963 and 1965. Although not consecutive, &quot;Love &amp; War&quot; equalled &quot;Freya&#x27;s&quot; three titles by winning its third in 2006 to add to its 1974 and 1978 titles.

In the 1994 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, the making waves foundation&#x27;s crew were the first fully disabled team to compete in an ocean race and Australian Paralympic sitting volleyball player Albert Lee was a part of this team.

The 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race was marred by tragedy when, during an exceptionally strong storm (which had similar strength winds to a lower-category hurricane), five boats sank and six people died. Of the 115 boats that started, only 44 made it to Hobart. As a result, the crew eligibility rules were tightened, requiring a higher minimum age and experience. G. Bruce Knecht wrote a book about this race, &quot;The Proving Ground&quot;. A coronial enquiry into the race was critical of both the race management at the time and the Bureau of Meteorology.

In 1999 the race record was broken by &quot;Nokia&quot;, a water-ballasted Volvo Ocean 60 (VO60) yacht. She sailed the course in 1 day, 19 hours, 48 minutes and 2 seconds. &quot;Brindabella&quot; reached Hobart just under one hour later (1 day, 20 hours, 46 minutes, 33 seconds) and &quot;Wild Thing&quot; was a close third (1 day, 21 hours, 13 minutes, 37 seconds). The previous Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race record had been set by &quot;Morning Glory&quot; (2 days, 14 hours, 7 minutes, 10 seconds) in 1996.


In 2004 only 59 yachts completed the course of the 116 who set out from Sydney. Storms hit the race. The super maxi &quot;Skandia&quot; capsized after losing her keel. In 2005, &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; became the first boat since &quot;Rani&quot; to win the &quot;treble&quot;, taking Line Honours, winning the Corrected Handicap (IRC), and breaking the course record. (1d 18h 40 m 10s, over 1hr off of &quot;Nokia&#x27;s&quot; record.)

In 1982 &quot;Condor of Burmuda&quot; won the Sydney to Hobart (1981) which was the closest ever finish, winning by just seven seconds against &quot;Apollo III&quot; during a gruelling match race up the River Derwent.

In 2006, 78 boats started the race, including entrants from the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, New Zealand, every Australian state and the Australian Capital Territory. The race started on schedule at 13:00 Australian Eastern Daylight Saving Time. &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot;, owned by Bob Oatley and skippered by Mark Richards, crossed the finish line at 21:52 on 28 December 2006 to take line honours with an elapsed time of 2 days, 8 hours, 52 minutes and 33 seconds. &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; became the first yacht to win the race in consecutive years since 1964 and only the sixth yacht to achieve this since the race&#x27;s inception. &quot;Love &amp; War&quot;, owned by Peter Kurts and skippered by Lindsay May, won the race overall (IRC Handicap) in a corrected time of 3 days, 22 hours 2 minutes and 37 seconds. &quot;Love &amp; War&quot; became only the second yacht to win the race three times (1974, 1978 and 2006). The yacht &quot;Freya&quot; won the race in three consecutive years between 1963 and 1965. &quot;Gillawa&quot; from the Australian Capital Territory, skippered by David Kent, was the sixty-ninth and last boat to complete the 2006 race, making it the third consecutive year that the yacht was last in the fleet.

The longest surviving skipper from the inaugural race, Peter Luke, who contributed to the formation of the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia and the establishment of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, died on 23 September 2007 aged 92. His yacht, &quot;Wayfarer&quot;, still holds the record for the slowest elapsed time. One of two surviving sailors from the original race – Geoffrey Ruggles from the &quot;Wayfarer&quot; crew, died in July 2019, leaving John Gordon from the &quot;Horizon&quot; crew.

By the November 2007 race entry deadline, 90 yachts had nominated for entry including four 90-foot maxis, three of them wanting to prevent &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; creating history and winning three line honours titles in a row. A little over a week prior to the race, New Zealand maxi &quot;Maximus&quot; withdrew after cracking its keel. Three-time and 2006 handicap winner, Love &amp; War, was not one of the applications for entry and may have raced her last Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in 2006. &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; went on to create history by winning its third consecutive line honours title and becoming only the second yacht to do so. &quot;Rosebud&quot; (USA) won the race on corrected time. John Walker became the oldest skipper in the history of the race at age 85 and Phillip&#x27;s Foote &quot;Witchdoctor&quot; bettered its own record and set a mark of 27 races as the most by a yacht.
On 3 November 2008 at the close of entries, 113 yachts had nominated for entry with only one other 90-foot maxi &quot;(Skandia)&quot; to challenge &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; and stop it creating history by winning four consecutive line honours titles and becoming the only yacht to do so. &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; achieved this and Bob Steel won his second Tattersall Cup with &quot;Quest&quot;, the second yacht with the same name to win the handicap title.

The 2009 fleet comprised 99 starters. In the 2008 race, &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; had equalled &quot;Morna&quot;/&quot;Kurrewa IV&quot;″s record of three consecutive line honours victories, which &quot;Morna&quot; achieved in 1946, 1947 and 1948, and was attempting to pass the record in its own right in 2009.

In the event however, Neville Crichton&#x27;s New Zealand entry &quot;Alpha Romeo II&quot; passed &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; early on and never relinquished her lead, finishing in an elapsed time of 2 days, 9 hours, 2 minutes and 10 seconds. &quot;Wild Oats XI&quot; came in second and United Kingdom-based &quot;ICAP Leopard&quot; came in third.

Sailors who have achieved outstanding commitment to the race are represented most of all by John Bennetto (dec), Lou Abrahams and Tony Cable who, after the 2007 race, had each sailed 44 races. Skippers Frank and John Livingston won four line honours titles while Claude Plowman, Peter Warner, S.A &quot;Huey&quot; Long, Jim Kilroy and Bob Bell have each won three. Trygve and Magnus Halvorsen have won four handicap honours titles while a number of skippers have won two handicap titles.

Rolex has been the naming rights sponsor of the race since 2002, and since then the race has been known as the &quot;Rolex Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race&quot;. Traditionally, crews of yachts celebrate on New Year&#x27;s Eve at Constitution Dock in Hobart, with the Customs House Hotel a favourite venue for Sydney–Hobart yachtsmen.

The 2020 race was cancelled due to an outbreak of COVID-19 in Sydney&#x27;s north. The Cruising Yacht Club said it was &quot;unrealistic&quot; to proceed with the race after the Tasmanian government declared Greater Sydney a &quot;medium risk&quot; zone, requiring all participants to quarantine for 14 days on arrival in Tasmania. It was the first time the race was not conducted in its 76-year history.

2020 saw the introduction of a two-handed division (only two crew members permitted) with its own trophy, the Two-Handed IRC Trophy. Due to the race being cancelled in 2020, the first two-handed entrants competed in the 2021 race.

The death of two sailors in separate incidents during the 2024 race (the first deaths since 1998) has led some to argue for a review of the race&#x27;s safety protocols.

==&quot;Holy Grail&quot;==
With the smashing of the Sydney–Hobart Race record in 1999 by Nokia—and a host of other super-fast boats that completed the course in less than two days for the first time—the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of the Sydney–Hobart race, a completion of the course in a time under the 40-hour mark, became a possibility. Many of the skippers competing in the Sydney–Hobart race in the 21st century have expressed a desire to be the first to record a time under the once thought of as impossible mark of 40 hours. In 2017, this goal was met when the race record was set by LDV Comanche to 33 hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds.

Comanche won again in 2019 and 2022 without breaking the 40-hour mark. In 2024, she was in the lead but retired when the mast broke. LawConnect took line honours with a time of 37 hours, 35 minutes, 13 seconds, breaking the 40-hour mark but not breaking Comanche&#x27;s record.

==Women&#x27;s involvement==
Women first participated in the race in 1946. The first woman to take part was Jane Tate, whose boat &quot;Active&quot; was the only one to reach Hobart in 1946. Dagmar O&#x27;Brien, with boat &quot;Connella&quot;, also took part in that year but retired from the race before finishing. Thus, the Jane Tate Memorial Trophy is awarded each year to the first female skipper to complete the race.

In 1975, the first all-women crew sailed was the boat &quot;Barbarian&quot;, skippered by Vicki Willman.

In 1996, Kathy Collingridge crewed on &quot;One Time Sidewinder&quot;. She was the first Indigenous woman to take part in the race.

Since then up to 2021, there have been another 12. The following is the list of all female crews to compete:

In 2005, 24 women took part, including Adrienne Cahalan, who is famed for her around-the-world sailing, has been nominated several times for World Yachtswoman of the Year and was Australian Yachtswoman of the Year for 2004–05. In 2005 she was part of the crew for the winning &quot;Wild Oats&quot;.

In 2011, Jessica Watson, known for her solo unassisted sail around the world at age 16, skippered the Sydney Hobart yacht race with a crew of six other young Australians and three Britons all aged 21 or under, making them some of the youngest ever to compete in the blue water classic.

In 2018, skippered by Stacey Jackson, Ocean Respect Racing (on Wild Oats X) became the first fully professional all women&#x27;s crew to compete in the Sydney Hobart.

In 2022, Kathy Veel and Bridget Canham, whom had met on Kerry Goudge&#x27;s Nadia IV in 1993, raced Currawong to the finish line, becoming the first all women&#x27;s crew to complete the race in the Two-Handed division.

In total, over a thousand women have taken part in the race.

==Rules==

The exact rules for the Tattersall Cup have changed over the years. In general, each boat&#x27;s time is adjusted on the expected speed of the boat based on its size and other characteristics. The International Offshore Rules were superseded by the International Measurement System (IMS), and the IRC. For 1991, 1992 &amp; 1993 races, the winners of the IOR and IMS categories were both declared Overall winners during the transition from IOR to IMS. However, the Tattersall Cup was awarded only to the Overall IOR winner during this period. Since 1994 there has been only one Overall winner, from 1994 to 2003 being decided using IMS, but from the 2004 onwards the Overall winner of the Tattersall Cup has been decided using IRC, with IMS dropped altogether as a handicap system. In theory, this should make for an even competition between yachts of all sizes, however in practice often only the newest and most advanced boats (regardless of size) can sail fast relative to their rating. In addition, in a race of the length of the Sydney–Hobart weather conditions after the maxi yachts have finished can often determine whether they will win on handicap – if the winds become more favourable after they finish, they will lose on handicap, if they become less favourable they will win.

The race is conducted under the Racing Rules of Sailing determined and published by the International Sailing Federation. For the 2005 race, the event organisers removed certain restrictions on the boats. As successful sailing is based on a good power-to-weight ratio, larger sails are expected to help break race records.

== Two-handed division ==
2020 saw the introduction of a two-handed division (only two crew members permitted) with its own trophy, the Two-Handed IRC Trophy.

Due to the race being cancelled in 2020, the first two-handed entrants competed in the 2021 race, which attracted 18 entrants. Two-handed yachts were not included in the Tattersall Cup because organisers could not establish an equitable handicap due to two-handed yachts’ use of autopilots.

In 2021 rough conditions meant that just seven two handers made it through the first night, with the others retiring at port. The first two-handed category was won by Disko Trooper-Contender Sailcloth, a J/99.

In 2022, two-handed yachts were allowed to contend for the Tattersalls Cup. There were 22 entries making it the fastest growing section of the race. The 2022 2-handed IRC was won by &#x27;Mistral&#x27;, a Lombard 34. &#x27;Mistral&#x27; finished 29th in the Tattersalls Cup. By 2023, two-handed entries comprised 17.5% of the total fleet.

==Yachts==
The fleet comprises mostly sloops; that is, yachts with a single mast on which is hoisted a fore-and-aft rigged mainsail and a single jib or Genoa, plus extras such as a spinnaker.

The race has encouraged innovation in yacht design. Between 1945 and 2005, the most successful yacht designer has been the New Zealand designer Bruce Farr, who has designed 15 overall winners.

==Winners and fleet sizes==

Notes:
*Time in bold denotes new race record time.

== Sponsors, supporters and prizes ==

Rolex has been the naming rights sponsor of the race since 2002. Other sponsors of the race include Appliances Online, Nortel Networks and TasPorts.

It generally costs each of the major contenders for line honors millions of dollars to equip themselves for the race, however there is no prize money. The only award is a Rolex watch from the race sponsor for the fastest and handicap winning yacht captains. Entrants compete for the honour of the title.

The overall (handicap) winner on corrected time is awarded The George Adams Tattersall Cup, first awarded to the winner of the 1946 race (and retrospectively to the 1945 winner).

Among the other trophies awarded during the race are the J H Illingworth Challenge Cup for the line honours boat and the Jane Tate Memorial Trophy for the first female skipper.

==In popular culture==
The race features in the 2007 novel &quot;The Storm Prophet&quot; by Hector Macdonald.

<text>The Udmurts (, ) are a Permian (Finno-Ugric) ethnic group in Eastern Europe, who speak the Udmurt language. They mainly live in the republic of Udmurtia in Russia.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Udmurt&quot; comes from * &#x27;meadow people,&#x27; where the first part represents the Permic root * meaning &#x27;meadow, glade, turf, greenery&#x27;. The second part, &quot;murt&quot;, means &#x27;person&#x27; (cf. Komi , Mari , Mordvin &quot;mirď-&quot;), probably an early borrowing from an Iranian language (such as Scythian): * or * meaning &#x27;person, man&#x27; (cf. Persian ). This, in turn, is thought to have been borrowed from the Indo-Aryan term * &#x27;man&#x27;, literally &#x27;mortal, one who is bound to die&#x27; (&lt; PIE &#x27;to die&#x27;), compare Old Indic &#x27;young warrior&#x27; and Old Indic &#x27;chariot warrior&#x27;, both connected specifically with horses and chariots. This is supported by a document dated 1557, in which the Udmurts are referred to as &quot;lugovye lyudi&quot; &#x27;meadow people&#x27;, alongside the traditional Russian name .

On the other hand, in the Russian tradition, the name &#x27;meadow people&#x27; refers to the inhabitants of the left bank of a river in general. Most relevant in this regard is the recent theory proposed by V. V. Napolskikh and S. K. Belykh, who suppose that the ethnonym was borrowed from Proto-Iranian entirely: meaning &#x27;resident of outskirts, border zone&#x27; (cf. &quot;Antes&quot;) → Proto-Permic * → Udmurt .

During the course of the Russian Empire, Udmurts have been referred to mainly as &#x27; (), Otyaks, Wotyaks or Votyaks, all being exonyms. Today such exonyms are considered offensive by Udmurts themselves and are mainly used against those who have forgotten the Udmurt language. The Udmurts are closely related to Komis to their north, both linguistically and culturally.

==Distribution==

Most Udmurt people live in Udmurtia. Small groups live in the neighboring areas of Kirov Oblast and Perm Krai, Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, and Mari El.

The Udmurt population is shrinking; the Russian Census reported 552,299 in 2010, down from the 2002 Russian census figure of 637,000, in turn down from 746,562 in 1989.
The 2021 census counted fewer Udmurts than had the 1926 census.
==Culture==

The Udmurt language belongs to the Uralic family.

The Udmurts have a national epic called &quot;Dorvyzhy&quot;. Their national musical instruments include the &quot;krez&quot; zither (similar to the Russian &quot;gusli&quot;) and a pipe-like wind instrument called the .

A chapter in the French from 1776 is devoted to the description of the Wotyak people.
James George Frazer also mentions a rite performed by the people in his book &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;.

Many Udmurt people have red hair, and a festival to celebrate the red-haired people has been held annually in Izhevsk since 2004.

The Udmurts used to be semi-nomadic forest dwellers that lived in riverside communities. However, most Udmurts now live in towns. Although the clan-based social structure of the Udmurts no longer exists, its traces are still strong and it continues to shape modern Udmurt culture.

== Genetics ==
According to the data gathered by Kristiina Tambets and others (2018), the majority (about 70 %) of Udmurt men carry the haplogroup N. The high frequency of this East Eurasian-related haplogroup is a common pattern among Uralic-speaking peoples. Most Udmurt men belong to the subclade N1c and 16.8 percent of them belong the subclade N1b-P43. The second most common Y-DNA haplogroup among Udmurts is R1a (19 %).

The most common maternal haplogroup for Udmurts is U (23.5%). Most Udmurts who have it belong to its subclades U2 (10.4 %) and U5 (9.3 %). Nearly as common is H (22.5 %). Other mtDNA haplogroups among Udmurts include T (16.5 %), D (11 %) and Z (6 %).When it comes to the autosomal ancestry of Udmurts, around 30 percent of it is Nganasan-like. This Siberian component is typical for Uralic-speaking peoples. The rest can be modelled to be mostly Steppe-like with a smaller eastern hunter-gatherer component, or Srubnaya-like. It is common for Northeastern Europeans to have a high level of Steppe-related admixture.

<text>Call waiting is a telephone service where a subscriber can accept a second incoming telephone call by placing an in-progress call on hold—and may also switch between calls. With some providers it can be combined with additional features such as conferencing, call forwarding, and caller ID. Call waiting is intended to alleviate the need to have more than one telephone line or number for voice communications.

==History==
Call waiting was introduced to North America in the early 1970s when the first generation of electronic switch machines built by Western Electric, Electronic Signaling System 1 started to replace older mechanical equipment in the old Bell System local telephone companies. At first, some smaller municipalities were able to offer customers call waiting only on a specific phone exchange (e.g., phone customers in Trenton, Michigan initially had to have a phone number starting with 671 to have call waiting, since 671 was at that time the only exchange in that area served by one of the new ESS switches), but as demand for it became more widespread, it eventually became available on all phone exchanges as the older equipment was phased out.

In Europe, call waiting was also introduced in the 1970s with the introduction of the first digital switching systems such as the Ericsson AXE, Alcatel E10 and System 12. It was also available on some Ericsson crossbar exchanges, such as the ARE11 which, while electromechanical, was also computerised. Other digital systems such as the UK&#x27;s System X also supported the service. Switching systems developed in the 1980s such as the German Siemens/Bosch EWSD also had call waiting.

==Star codes==

In North America, the NANP uses the *70 star code prefix to suspend call waiting for a dialed call. A stutter dial tone confirms the de-activation.

On most European telephone networks, and GSM or UMTS mobile phones, call waiting is activated by dialing the following codes:
* To activate: *43#
* To deactivate: #43#
* To check status: *#43#
A voice announcement, tone or a message on your phone&#x27;s screen will confirm the service status.

Call waiting in Europe uses an &quot;R&quot; (recall) button on the phone. This performs a similar function to a North American hook flash button but is much shorter duration, typically 80ms to 100ms, vs. 250ms in North America. In some networks, pressing R toggles between the calls, similar to North America. However, in most countries there are further options:
* R1 – Answer the waiting call and hang up on the current call.
* R2 – Toggle between the calls.
* R3 – Merge the two calls for conference calling.
* R0 – Reject call waiting – This will send the call to voice mail or a busy tone.
Type II Caller ID also works with call waiting.

==Line sharing==
Since the waiting call uses a zip tone (for example, a beep every ten seconds in North America), call waiting can cause dial-up Internet access connections to terminate, unless the modem supports the most recent V.92 modem standard. For this reason, call waiting is often disabled on shared voice lines used for dial-up modem or fax purposes. However, Call Waiting has no impact on DSL connections.

==Call waiting deluxe==
Call waiting deluxe is the Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies) term for Type II caller ID with Disposition Options.

This CLASS-based POTS-telephone calling feature works by combining the services of call waiting with caller ID but also introduces an &quot;options&quot; feature that, in conjunction with certain screen-based telephones, or other capable equipment, gives a telephone user the option to:

* Switch: Place the current call on hold to take the second call (not a new feature)
* Hang-up: Disconnect the current call and take the second call 
* Please Hold: Send the caller either a custom or telephone-company-generated voice message asking the caller to hold
* Forward to Voice Mail: Send the incoming caller to the recipient’s voice mail service.
* Join: Add the incoming caller to the existing conversation.

<doc id="406816" wikidata="Q240215" url="?curid=406816" title="Call forwarding">
<text>Call forwarding, or call diversion, is a telephony feature of all telephone switching systems which redirects a telephone call to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. Call forwarding was invented by Ernest J. Bonanno. 

In North America, the forwarded line usually rings once to remind the customer using call forwarding that the call is being redirected. More consistently, the forwarded line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. Call forwarding typically can redirect incoming calls to any other domestic telephone number, but the owner of the forwarded line must pay any toll charges for forwarded calls. Call forwarding is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which calls should be forwarded. Once someone answers, call forwarding is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect call forwarding. Call forwarding is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to call forwarding, which permit the control over call forwarding from telephones other than the subscriber&#x27;s telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also allow call forwarding to be set up and directed via their web portals. Call forwarding can be Conditional or Unconditional. Conditional call forwarding only works when the conditions set by the customers met while Unconditional call forwarding works in all cases irrelevant of network coverage.

In Europe, most networks indicate that unconditional call forwarding is active with a special dial tone. When the phone is picked up it is immediately apparent that calls are being forwarded, while in other countries same system is being followed now.

==Terminology==
The ISDN Diversion supplementary services standards document uses &quot;diversion&quot; as a general term to encompass specific features including &quot;Call Forwarding Busy&quot;, &quot;Call Forwarding No Reply&quot; and &quot;Call Deflection&quot;.

The terms &quot;call forwarding&quot; and &quot;call diversion&quot; are both used to refer to any feature that allows a call to be routed to a third party, and the terms are generally interchangeable.

==Keypad codes==
===North America===
Special types of call forwarding can be activated only if the line is busy, or if there is no answer, or even only for calls from selected numbers. In North America, the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) generally uses the following vertical service codes to control call forwarding:

The Sprint Nextel cellphone company uses these:

* , Sprint charges 20 cents per minute for unconditional call forwarding; conditional call forwarding is included, however.
* Some carriers (including Verizon Wireless) use *71 for conditional forwarding although this is not standard.
* Sometimes, to deactivate call forwarding, *720 will work on cellphones.

===Europe===
Most EU fixed-line carriers use the following codes based on CEPT and ETSI standards developed in the 1970s on both POTS and ISDN lines. (There may be some variation to these, but the unconditional code *21* is very much universally standard on EU telephone lines.) The general syntax for all European service codes always follows the pattern below:

===Mobile (cell) phones===
For GSM/3GSM (UMTS) phones, the GSM standard defines the following forwarding Unstructured Supplementary Service Data. These were developed by ETSI and are based on standard European diversion codes and are similar to those used on most landlines in the EU:

If the prefix to the forwarding command is &quot;**&quot; (instead of the usual &quot;*&quot;), then the phone number in that command is registered in the network. If after that the forwarding is deactivated using a command with a single &quot;#&quot;, then later it will be possible to re-activate this forwarding again with a simple &quot;*&quot; command without a phone number in it. The forwarding will be re-activated to the number registered in the network. For example, if one uses the out-of-reach code in a forwarding command:

codice_1

and after that one deactivates the forwarding:

codice_2

then later it will be possible to re-activate the out-of-reach forwarding without specifying a number:

codice_3

After the above command, all calls made to the phone, while it is out of reach, will be forwarded to 7035551212. It is possible to activate the feature to a number other than the registered number, while still retaining the registered number for later use. For example, issuing the command:

codice_4

will result in calls being forwarded to 7185551212 (and not to the &quot;registered number&quot; 7035551212). However, if later a command is issued:

codice_3

then the calls will again be forwarded to the registered number 7035551212 (and not to the number from the previous forwarding command 7185551212).

===Forwarding delay===
In GSM networks of some US carriers, and in all mobile networks in Europe, it is possible to set a number of seconds for the phone to ring before forwarding the call. This is specified by inserting &quot;*SC*XX&quot; prior to the final &quot;#&quot; of the forwarding command, where &quot;&quot;SC&quot; is a &quot;service type code&quot; (11 for &quot;voice&quot;, 25 for &quot;data&quot;, 13 for &quot;fax&quot;), and &quot;XX&quot; is the number of seconds in increments of 5 seconds. If &quot;SC&quot; is omitted (just &quot;**XX&quot;&quot;) then by default &quot;all service types&quot; will be forwarded. For example, forwarding on no-answer can be set with:

codice_6

Forwarding voice calls only can be set with:

codice_7

In some networks there may be a limit of not more than thirty seconds before forwarding (i.e. “&quot;XX&quot;” can only be 05, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30; all greater values, like 45 and 60, will result in the forwarding command being rejected and an error message returned).

==Uses==
Diverting calls can increase one&#x27;s availability to callers. The main alternative is an answering machine or voicemail, but some callers do not wish to leave a recorded message, but want to have a two-way conversation.

Some businesses have their calls forwarded to a call center, so that the client can reach an operator instead of an answering machine or voice mail. Before the availability of call forwarding, commercial answering services needed to physically connect to every line for which they provided after-hours response; this required their offices to be located near the local central exchange and be fed by a huge multi-pair trunk in which a separate pair of wires existed for each client subscriber. With call forwarding, there is no physical connection to the client&#x27;s main telephone service, which is merely call-forwarded to the answering service (usually on a direct inward dial number) at the end of the business day.

Often, a suburb of a large city is a toll call from many suburban exchanges on the opposite side of the same city, even though all of these suburbs are a local call to the city centre. A business located in such a suburb may therefore benefit from obtaining a downtown number as an &quot;extender&quot;, to be permanently forwarded to their geographic suburban number.

Where unlimited local calls are flat-rated and long-distance incurs high per-minute charges, the downtown number&#x27;s wider local calling area represents a commercial advantage. Markham (directly north of Toronto) is long-distance to Mississauga (directly west of Toronto). A Markham business with a forwarded 416 number could receive calls from Toronto&#x27;s entire local calling area without incurring long-distance tolls (as both legs, Mississauga → Toronto and Toronto → Markham, are each a local call).

Some services offer international call forwarding by allocating for the customer a local virtual phone number which is forwarded to any other international destination. The number was permanently forwarded and had no associated telephone line. As a means to obtain an inbound number from another town or region for business use, remote call forwarding schemes tend to be far less expensive than foreign exchange lines but more costly than using voice over IP to obtain a local number in the chosen city.

Call forwarding can also assist travelers who do not have international cell phone plans and who wish to continue to receive their voicemails through VoIP easily while abroad.

<doc id="406829" wikidata="Q400010" url="?curid=406829" title="Interstate 780">
<text>Interstate 780 (I-780) is an east–west auxiliary Interstate Highway in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California. It runs from the intersection of Curtola Parkway and Lemon Street in Vallejo east to I-680 just north of the Benicia–Martinez Bridge in Benicia. It closely parallels the Carquinez Strait for its entire route. Originally, this segment was part of I-680 before that Interstate was extended and rerouted to Fairfield. The city-maintained Curtola Parkway continues west to State Route 29 (SR 29) in Vallejo.

==Route description==
The I-780 state-maintained freeway begins at Lemon Street and Curtola Parkway, quickly crossing underneath I-80 at a cloverleaf interchange. The freeway passes through parts of unincorporated Solano County, then heads southeast along the Benicia State Recreation Area (a marsh). It then bypasses downtown Benicia through the hills to the north. I-780 ends at I-680 at the north end of the Benicia–Martinez Bridge, with I-680 heading south through the East Bay to San Jose.

I-780 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and, as with every Interstate Highway, is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

==History==
By 1914, a paved county road connected Vallejo and Benicia north of the Carquinez Strait, following the present Maine Street, Benicia Road, Columbus Parkway, and K Street. Although state highways were designated to Benicia in 1910 (Legislative Route (LRN) 7, now I-680) and Vallejo in 1931 (LRN 74, now SR 29), this connection was not added until 1935, when LRN 74 (an unsigned designation) was extended east from Vallejo to Benicia and north along former LRN 7 to Fairfield. (A short spur connecting Vallejo to the Carquinez Bridge was added to LRN 74 in 1937.) LRN 74 initially entered Benicia on K Street and left on East 5th Street, making several turns in between. Two realignments were built in the 1940s, reducing the number of turns to one, at the corner of L and East 2nd streets.

On September 15, 1955, the Bureau of Public Roads approved the Interstate Highway System spurs and connections in urban areas. Among these was a loop around the San Francisco Bay, soon numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) incorporated a number of existing legislative routes, including LRN 69, LRN 108, LRN 107, LRN 75, and LRN 74, crossing the Carquinez Strait on the proposed Benicia–Martinez Bridge and ending at I-80 near downtown Vallejo. The first piece of this freeway north of the Carquinez Strait was at the I-80 cloverleaf interchange, built in the late 1950s when I-80 was upgraded through Vallejo. This was an extremely short roadway, beginning at Lemon Street, crossing under I-80 and Laurel Street and ending at Reis Avenue and Cedar Street. In about 1960, it was extended east to the old highway (Columbus Parkway) between the cities and was completed to the new bridge in about 1962, the year the bridge opened.
In the 1964 state highway renumbering, the legislative designation of the completed Vallejo–Benicia freeway was changed from LRN 74 to LRN 680, reflecting its Interstate designation. The short piece of nonfreeway in Vallejo, extending west from I-80 to SR 29, became State Route 141 (SR 141). This route followed Benicia Road and Maine Street, the same alignment the state highway had always taken; it initially connected with I-780 via Lemon Street but later followed Benicia Road from I-80 north of I-780. In 1975, a proposed (and never constructed) extension west and north to SR 37 east of the Napa River was added to LRN 141. The route was to be the Waterfront Freeway, scaled down to a boulevard in 1974.

The FHWA approved a relocation of I-680 onto the SR 21 freeway between Benicia and Fairfield in July 1973. To keep the route to Vallejo in the Interstate system, it was renumbered I-780; the corresponding legislative changes were made in 1976. As part of the project to construct a new northbound Benicia–Martinez Bridge, the I-680/I-780 interchange was rebuilt; the new span opened in August 2007. LRN 141 was deleted from the state highway system in 1988, soon after the city of Vallejo constructed Curtola Parkway over (replacing Maryland Street) just to the south, directly connecting I-780 with a surface road to SR 29.

==Exit list==
Mileage was measured from east-to-west based on the alignment of LRN 680 as it existed at that time. Exit numbers were still assigned the conventional west-to-east ascension.

<doc id="406831" wikidata="Q317803" url="?curid=406831" title="Matt Le Tissier">
<text>Matthew Paul Le Tissier (; born 14 October 1968) is a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Le Tissier spent his entire professional club career with Southampton, before turning to non-League football in 2002; his loyalty garnered special affection from Southampton&#x27;s fans who nicknamed him &quot;Le God&quot;.

A creative attacking midfielder with exceptional technical skills, Le Tissier is the second-highest-ever scorer for Southampton behind Mick Channon, and was voted PFA Young Player of the Year in 1990. He was the first midfielder to score 100 goals in the Premier League. He is notable for his record at scoring penalty kicks – converting from the spot 47 times from 48 attempts – and is considered one of the greatest ever from the 12-yard spot. Born in Guernsey, Le Tissier opted to represent England, winning eight caps from 1994 to 1997. In 2011, he became honorary president of Guernsey F.C., and briefly came out of retirement to play for the club in 2013.

Following his retirement as a player, Le Tissier became a football pundit, and worked as a panellist on the Sky Sports show &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; until August 2020. In his retirement, he has made several posts on social media, concerning COVID-19 and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which were met with criticism.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Le Tissier was born in Guernsey, a British crown dependency, and played youth football on the island with Vale Recreation between the ages of seven and sixteen. At fifteen, he had a trial at English club Oxford United, but nothing came of it.

===Southampton===
Signing for Southampton on YTS forms in 1985 and then signing professional forms in October 1986, Le Tissier made his club debut in a 4–3 defeat at Norwich City in the First Division, and by the end of that season had scored six goals in 24 league games, including a hat-trick against Leicester City in the league. He scored his first two competitive goals in a League Cup third-round replay at home to Manchester United on 4 November 1986, a game which Southampton won 4–1 and was Ron Atkinson&#x27;s last in charge of the visitors, his sacking coming within 48 hours of the result. Le Tissier made 19 first team league appearances in the 1987–88 season, failing to score, but in the 1988–89 season, scored nine times in 28 league games.

Le Tissier was voted PFA Young Player of the Year for the 1989–90 season, in which he was one of the league&#x27;s top goalscorers with 20 goals as Southampton finished seventh in the First Division, the club&#x27;s highest finish for five years.

Le Tissier&#x27;s highest-scoring league season was in the 1993–94 season, in which he scored 25 league goals. The following season, he won the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; Goal of the Season award for his drifting 40-yard chip against Blackburn Rovers, scoring against his long-term friend, and former Southampton keeper, Tim Flowers.

Le Tissier&#x27;s goal tally for the season regularly went well into double figures for the league alone throughout the 1990s, playing a major role in Southampton preserving their top flight status into the new millennium as they came close to relegation on five occasions in the first seven seasons of the Premier League – including one season when they only survived on goal difference. He was the subject of interest from many big clubs in England and overseas during this time, particularly from Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United, but the transfer never happened and Le Tissier would ultimately remain a Southampton player until his retirement. In August 1995, Chelsea reportedly made a £10 million bid for Le Tissier which would have made him the most expensive player in English football at the time. Shortly afterwards, defending league champions Blackburn Rovers were reportedly planning to sign him for a similar-sized fee.

On 2 April 2000, Le Tissier scored a last-minute penalty for Southampton in a 2–1 defeat to Sunderland. This brought his tally of Premier League goals to 100, making him only the sixth player and first midfielder to reach this milestone.

Le Tissier scored the last goal in the final competitive match played at The Dell on 19 May 2001, against Arsenal. This turned out to be his last goal for Southampton. He played several games for the club during the 2001–02 season, the first season at the new St Mary&#x27;s Stadium, in an eventual 11th-place finish. His final competitive appearance for the &quot;Saints&quot; came against West Ham United on 30 January 2002. He announced on 29 March 2002 that he would retire from playing at the season&#x27;s end after limping off with a recurrence of a calf strain during a reserve team game against Charlton Athletic.

Le Tissier&#x27;s final match, a testimonial against an England XI in May 2002, ended in a 9–9 draw, with Le Tissier playing 45 minutes for each side, while his ten-year-old son Mitchell came on as a substitute in the second half, scoring four times.

Throughout his career, Le Tissier had a fearsome reputation for scoring from the spot, converting 47 of the 48 penalties that he took for Southampton. His sole failure to convert came on 24 March 1993 in a match against Nottingham Forest, his spot kick being saved by Forest keeper Mark Crossley, the feat being so unique that Crossley describes it as the save of which he is most proud.

===Eastleigh===
After leaving Southampton, Le Tissier had a two-season-long spell with non-league side Eastleigh, where he played alongside his former Southampton teammate David Hughes. He made his debut in a 3–0 victory over Newport (IOW) in the Hampshire Senior Cup in October 2002. He played his last match for the club early in August 2003, starring in the Hampshire Chronicle Cup Final second-leg victory against Winchester City.

===Guernsey===
On 7 April 2013, ten years after retiring from football, Le Tissier announced he had come out of retirement and signed with his hometown club Guernsey. A number of fixture postponements meant that they had to play 17 league fixtures in a month, and Le Tissier announced that he would be able to play in four or five games, also saying he was unable to play Saturday games due to his job as a television pundit on &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot;. He made his only appearance for the club on 24 April, as a substitute for Ollie McKenzie, in a 4–2 defeat in their Combined Counties League Premier Division clash with Colliers Wood United.

==International career==
Le Tissier represented Guernsey&#x27;s under-15 side, playing in the 1983 Muratti Vase final against Jersey U15.

Le Tissier chose to play for England, joining a relatively small group of players who were not born in the country, and earned eight caps over three years. Guernsey, although largely self-governing, does not have an official FIFA national team, which made Le Tissier eligible to play for England. He was picked by the manager Terry Venables to start the ill-fated friendly match against the Republic of Ireland at Lansdowne Road, on 15 February 1995. With Ireland leading from a 22nd-minute goal by David Kelly, a group of England fans began to riot, causing the Dutch referee Dick Jol to abandon the match.

In the run-up to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Le Tissier scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 victory for England B against Russia B at Loftus Road; despite this, he was overlooked by manager Glenn Hoddle for the final squad. He never played for England again after the tournament.

==Style of play==
Le Tissier was a creative and technically gifted attacking midfielder, with an eye for goal, known for his ball striking, and ability to get into good attacking positions, in addition to his vision, and ability to create chances for teammates; these abilities also enabled him to play as a supporting striker on occasion, or even on the right wing, although this was not his favoured position. Despite his poor work-rate, and lack of notable pace or stamina, he was known for his excellent control, technique, balance, and dribbling skills, as well as his intelligence on the ball, and his use of tricks and feints, which allowed him to beat opponents. He was also known for his extreme accuracy on penalties.

Former FC Barcelona player and manager, Xavi Hernandez idolised Le Tissier in his youth.

==Post-retirement==
On the former site of The Dell, which was Southampton F.C.&#x27;s old stadium, the names of apartment blocks honour Southampton Football Club players; one is named Le Tissier Court. At Southampton F.C.&#x27;s current ground, St Mary&#x27;s Stadium, one of the hospitality suites is named after him.

On 7 February 2007, a plane in the Flybe fleet was named after him on his home island of Guernsey. It was withdrawn from use in July 2011.

After Southampton&#x27;s relegation to level three in 2008–09, Le Tissier initially offered to help with a bid to take over the club, but later withdrew, amidst some controversy.

In September 2009, Le Tissier revealed in his autobiography that he had placed a spread bet on a match he was involved in during his playing career. During an April 1995 match at Wimbledon, Le Tissier stood to win &quot;well into four figures&quot; after betting on the time of the first throw-in. After kicking off, he tried to overhit a pass to unsuspecting teammate Neil Shipperley, but due to nerves, underhit it and Shipperley was able to keep the ball in play. Le Tissier revealed he had &quot;never run so much&quot; in his life as he tried to put the ball out of play to avoid losing money, with the ball eventually going out of play after 70 seconds, meaning Le Tissier and his associates neither won nor lost money. The event was investigated by Hampshire Police but the Crown Prosecution Service refused to take the case further, citing that it did &quot;not represent appropriate use of police resources&quot; and &quot;would not be in the public interest&quot;.

Le Tissier made a cameo appearance for Southampton in Claus Lundekvam&#x27;s testimonial against Celtic, on 18 July 2008. Lundekvam had previously played with him at Southampton from 1996 to 2002.

In 2011, Le Tissier accepted the position of Honorary President of Guernsey F.C.

In August 2016, Le Tissier and ex-Southampton teammate Francis Benali announced that they had gone into business as football agents. Speaking about their joint business venture, Le Tissier commented that their aim was to provide &quot;guidance and support on every aspect of a footballer&#x27;s career – on and off the field&quot;. Benali added: &quot;We&#x27;ve got a real passion for football and are keen to impart our experience and knowledge to help players make the right decisions for their careers.&quot; He was a long-term panellist on Sky Sports show &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; until August 2020 when he was dropped. Whilst working for Sky Sports, Le Tissier said that he was required to wear a Black Lives Matter badge and was only told this &quot;about a minute&quot; before the show started. After wearing the badge for one show he subsequently refused to, and he believed that this contributed to his dismissal.

In 2019 and 2020, Le Tissier featured in both seasons of ITV show &quot;Harry&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends.

In 2020, Le Tissier became an outspoken critic of the reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. He issued several tweets criticising what he deemed to be an &quot;overreaction&quot; by the government and media, among others, opposing lockdowns and mask orders. An image he posted on Twitter which implied a comparison between the Holocaust and having to wear masks during the pandemic was deleted. In 2021, Le Tissier drew widespread criticism again for promoting unverified correlations, when he suggested that Christian Eriksen&#x27;s on-pitch cardiac arrest was an adverse reaction to being vaccinated, despite Eriksen not being vaccinated. In November 2021 he faced further criticism, this time by epidemiologists, as one of several former professional footballers &quot;demanding investigations into links&quot; between onfield collapses and COVID vaccinations, after three footballers collapsed in one week.

Le Tissier controversially retweeted a post on Twitter concerning the Bucha massacre, committed during Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, suggesting the media was lying in its coverage of the event. Following backlash, Le Tissier stepped down from his role as a Club Ambassador at Southampton on 6 April.

On 4 May 2022, Jersey Bulls cancelled an appearance of Le Tissier after he was previously announced as the special guest at their awards dinner following fan backlash.

In February 2024, Le Tissier was probed by the Advertising Standards Authority for misconduct while promoting and advertising Supreme CBD, owned by ex-boxer Anthony Fowler. Fowler along with other celebrities including Paul Merson, Le Tissier and John Hartson have all been investigated and issued with a warning by the ASA. The ASA investigation concluded that their social media posts have been found to be commercial in nature, and not &quot;honest&quot; opinions about the benefits of CBD, since they were being financially rewarded for their posts. The investigation also concluded that the posts made by these celebrities were making unlawful medical claims about the use of CBD, which is prohibited by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

In June 2024, Le Tissier joined non-league club Sholing as an associate director.

==Personal life==
Le Tissier married his childhood sweetheart Cathy, and had two children. The couple divorced in 1997; Cathy and the children moved back to Guernsey, after which he had a relationship with &quot;Home and Away&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; actress Emily Symons, before marrying Angela Nabulsi in April 2008 in a small ceremony. Together, they have one daughter. All three of Le Tissier&#x27;s brothers – Mark, Kevin and Carl – also played football, but never professionally. Mark is currently secretary of Guernsey F.C.

Le Tissier is not related to fellow Guernsey born football player Maya Le Tissier, although her father did play football with him.

<text>Interstate 980 (I-980) is a short auxiliary Interstate Highway entirely within Oakland in Northern California, connecting I-580 and State Route 24 (SR 24) to I-880 near Downtown Oakland. I-980 passes the Oakland Convention Center and near the famous Jack London Square. I-980 is commonly considered the dividing line between Downtown Oakland and West Oakland. The freeway was planned as the eastern approach to the Southern Crossing. The segment between I-880 and 17th Street is officially known as the John B. Williams Freeway, after the former director of the city of Oakland&#x27;s Office of Community Development. In addition, I-980 and SR 24 in Oakland are both designated as part of the &quot;Grove-Shafter Freeway&quot;, after streets the route travels along (Grove Street was later renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Way).

I-980 was used as an alternate route between Oakland and San Francisco when the Cypress Viaduct carrying I-880 collapsed in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Traffic headed from the south would have to use I-980 to I-580 west to I-80 west to get across the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge to reach San Francisco. This ended when I-880 reopened on a new alignment in 1997 (1998 to and from I-80 east).

==Route description==
Although I-980 physically goes north and south, it is signed as an east–west route like SR 24. Immediately after traffic leaves I-880 on elevated connector ramps, I-980 then descends below grade to pass under downtown city streets. The freeway then ascends above grade to pass over SR 123 (San Pablo Avenue) and 27th Street before reaching I-580 and SR 24.

The freeway itself lacks overhead guide signs mentioning I-980. Immediately after exit 1B (SR 123/17th Street) going eastbound on I-980 is a guide sign mentioning the junction with I-580. Likewise, the guide signs on westbound I-980 at exit 1D (18th Street) list I-880 and San Jose as a control city. Since 2018, Jackson Street and I-880 south have been signed as exits 1B and 1A in the westbound direction.

I-980 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

==History==
I-980 was added to the state highway system in 1947 as part of Legislative Route 226 (LRN 226) and to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959. This segment of LRN 226 became part of SR 24 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. The FHWA approved the addition of the roadway to the Interstate Highway System in January 1976, with Interstate funding only used west of SR 123, and the number was legislatively changed to I-980 in 1981.

Construction on I-980 began in the 1960s but was not completed until 1985; officially the freeway was designated as I-980 from its opening. The surface roads which existed prior to the completion of the freeway had been designated as SR 24. The highway was intended to serve the Southern Crossing and a regional shopping mall in Oakland, neither of which were ever built.

==Future==
The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported in November 2015 about a grassroots organization of local architects and planners, supported by Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf, that propose to replace I-980 with a landscaped city boulevard. ConnectOakland is coordinating the push for a replacement. Arguments for replacement focus on the freeway&#x27;s low volume of traffic and negative impact on surrounding neighborhoods. In January 2017, I-980 was included in Congress for the New Urbanism &quot;Freeways without Futures&quot; report.

Caltrans and the city of Oakland received a $680,000 Reconnecting Communities planning grant, funded by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, to study rebuilding or removing I-980. BART may use the corridor as an approach for a second Transbay Tube.

<text>The Heron Dinghy is a dinghy designed by Jack Holt of the United Kingdom as the Yachting World Cartopper (YW Cartopper). The Heron dinghy was designed to be built by a home handyman out of marine ply over a timber frame, but can now also be constructed from marine ply using a stitch and glue technique or from fibreglass. Modern dinghies will usually have built in buoyancy tanks; older craft will have bags or retrofitted tanks.

Since about 1980 boats have been increasingly made of fibreglass, although the Australian association has approved stitch and glue construction .

The Heron is sailed in the UK and Australia and New Zealand, with a few others spread around the world. UK class rules vary slightly from the Australian Rules. In the UK a spinnaker is permitted and a larger genoa can be used. The UK also permits the use of different rudder shapes and a Bermudan Mast. Other more minor differences exist between the rules. The Heron cartop dinghy was popular in Ireland from the late 1950s until the arrival of the Mirror which was lighter, easier to build, and had built in buoyancy.

They are mainly used as adult/child racing dinghies. For state and national titles the Olympic triangle course is often used.

The Heron has a Portsmouth Yardstick of 1346 when sailed single handed. In the US Sailing scheme it has a D-PN of 120.0.

Over 10,500 Heron sail numbers have been issued since the design first appeared in the late 1950s.

The first Heron, No 1 &quot;Flook&quot;, still exists and is now owned by the National Maritime Museum Cornwall.

<doc id="406840" wikidata="Q1712327" url="?curid=406840" title="Prophage">
<text>A prophage is a bacteriophage (often shortened to &quot;phage&quot;) genome that is integrated into the circular bacterial chromosome or exists as an extrachromosomal plasmid within the bacterial cell. Integration of prophages into the bacterial host is the characteristic step of the lysogenic cycle of temperate phages. Prophages remain latent in the genome through multiple cell divisions until activation by an external factor, such as UV light, leading to production of new phage particles that will lyse the cell and spread. As ubiquitous mobile genetic elements, prophages play important roles in bacterial genetics and evolution, such as in the acquisition of virulence factors.

== Prophage induction ==
Upon detection of host cell damage by UV light or certain chemicals, the prophage is excised from the bacterial chromosome in a process called prophage induction. After induction, viral replication begins via the lytic cycle. In the lytic cycle, the virus commandeers the cell&#x27;s reproductive machinery. The cell may fill with new viruses until it lyses or bursts, or it may release the new viruses one at a time in an exocytotic process. The period from infection to lysis is termed the latent period. A virus following a lytic cycle is called a virulent virus. Prophages are important agents of horizontal gene transfer, and are considered part of the mobilome. Genes are transferred via transduction as the prophage genome is imperfectly excised from the host chromosome and integrated into a new host (specialized transduction) or as fragments of host DNA are packaged into the phage particles and introduced into a new host (generalized transduction). All families of bacterial viruses that have circular (single-stranded or double-stranded) DNA genomes or replicate their genomes through rolling circle replication (e.g., Caudovirales) have temperate members.

During infections by the bacterial pathogen &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, spontaneous prophage release from the bacterial chromosome is common. The presence of deoxycholic acid in the intestinal environment can promote induction of &quot;C. difficle&quot; biofilm formation as well as the induction of prophage release.

==Zygotic induction==

Zygotic induction occurs when a bacterial cell carrying the DNA of a bacterial virus transfers its own DNA along with the viral DNA (prophage) into the new host cell. This has the effect of causing the host cell to break apart. The DNA of the bacterial cell is silenced before entry into the cell by a repressor protein which is encoded for by the prophage. Upon the transfer of the bacterial cell&#x27;s DNA into the host cell, the repressor protein is no longer encoded for, and the bacterial cell&#x27;s original DNA is then turned on in the host cell. This mechanism eventually will lead to the release of the virus as the host cell splits open and the viral DNA is able to spread. This new discovery provided key insights into bacterial conjugation and contributed to the early repression model of gene regulation, which provided an explanation as to how the lac operon and λ bacteriophage genes are negatively regulated.

==Prophage reactivation==

Bacteriophage λ is able to undergo a type of recombinational repair called prophage reactivation. Prophage reactivation can occur by recombination between a UV-damaged infecting phage λ chromosome and a homologous phage genome integrated into the bacterial DNA and existing in a prophage state. Prophage reactivation in the case of phage λ appears to be an accurate recombinational repair process that is mediated by the recA+ and red+ gene products.

== Cost/benefit to the host ==
Lysis of host cells during prophage induction can cause the collapse of a microbial population. On the other hand, induction, transduction and superinfection exclusion mechanisms confer many beneficial functions to the host. Induction of prophages allows hosts to compete in the microbial ecology by infecting and lysing susceptible bacteria. Phages also enable the host to pick up and integrate antibiotic resistance genes from nearby cells. Additionally, phages can enable the host to acquire virulence and pathogenicity genes. Modulation of biofilm formation is also affected by infection by lysogenic phages. Superinfection exclusion, or protection against infection by multiple phages, can be conferred by prophage integration. Additionally, phage-mediated recombination mechanisms may remodel the host chromosome and provide new ways for cells to regulate metabolism and gene expression, such as those involved in sporulation and competence.

== Applications ==
Prophages can tell researchers a lot about the relationship between a bacterium and a host. With data from more nonpathogenic bacteria, researchers will be able to gather evidence as to whether or not prophages contribute to the survival value of the host. Prophage genomics has the potential to lead to ecological adaptations of the relationships between bacteria. Another important area of interest is the control of prophage gene expression with many of the lysogenic conversion genes (gene conversion) being tightly regulated. This process is capable of converting non-pathogenic bacteria into pathogenic bacteria that can now produce harmful toxins such as in staph infections. Since the specific mechanisms of prophage are not yet detailed, this research could provide the community with this tool for future research.

==Economic impact==
Exotoxins encoded by prophages cause pathogenic outcomes in agriculture and aquaculture.

<text>STS-41-C (formerly STS-13) was NASA&#x27;s eleventh Space Shuttle mission, and the fifth mission of Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;. The launch, which took place on April 6, 1984, marked the first direct ascent trajectory for a Space Shuttle mission. During the mission, &quot;Challenger&quot;″s crew captured and repaired the malfunctioning Solar Maximum Mission (&quot;Solar Max&quot;) satellite, and deployed the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) experimental apparatus. STS-41-C was extended one day due to problems capturing the Solar Max satellite, and the landing on April 13, 1984, took place at Edwards Air Force Base, instead of at Kennedy Space Center as had been planned. The flight was originally numbered STS-13.

== Mission summary ==

STS-41-C launched successfully at 8:58 a.m. EST on April 6, 1984. The mission marked the first direct ascent trajectory for the Space Shuttle; &quot;Challenger&quot; reached its - high orbit using its Orbiter Maneuvering System (OMS) engines only once, to circularize its orbit. During the ascent phase, the main computer in Mission control center (MCC) failed, as did the backup computer. For about an hour, the controllers had no data on the orbiter.

The flight had two primary objectives. The first was to deploy the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), a passive, retrievable, 12-sided experimental cylinder. The LDEF was in diameter and long, and carried 57 scientific experiments. The second objective of STS-41-C was to capture, repair and redeploy the malfunctioning Solar Maximum Mission satellite (&quot;Solar Max&quot;), which had been launched in 1980.

On the second day of the flight, the LDEF was grappled by the Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) and successfully released into orbit. Its 57 experiments, mounted in 86 removable trays, were contributed by 200 researchers from eight countries. Retrieval of the passive LDEF was initially scheduled for 1985, but schedule delays and the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster of 1986 postponed the retrieval until January 12, 1990, when &quot;Columbia&quot; retrieved the LDEF during STS-32.

On the third day of the mission, &quot;Challenger&quot;″s orbit was raised to about , and it maneuvered to within of the stricken Solar Max satellite. Astronauts Nelson and van Hoften, wearing space suits, entered the payload bay. Nelson, using the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), flew out to the satellite and attempted to grasp it with a special capture tool, called the Trunnion Pin Acquisition Device (TPAD). Three attempts to clamp the TPAD onto the satellite failed. Solar Max began tumbling on multiple axes when Nelson attempted to grab one of the satellite&#x27;s solar arrays by hand, and the effort was called off. Crippen had to perform multiple maneuvers of the orbiter to keep up with Nelson and Solar Max, and nearly ran out of RCS fuel.

During the night of the third day, the Solar Max Payload Operations Control Center (POCC), located at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland, was able to establish control over the satellite by sending commands ordering the satellite&#x27;s magnetorquers to stabilize its tumbling. This was successful, and Solar Max went into a slow, regular spin. The next day, Crippen maneuvered &quot;Challenger&quot; back to Solar Max, and Hart was able to grapple the satellite with the RMS. They placed Solar Max on a special cradle in the payload bay using the RMS. Nelson and van Hoften then began the repair operation, replacing the satellite&#x27;s attitude control mechanism and the main electronics system of the coronagraph instrument. The ultimately successful repair effort took two separate spacewalks. Solar Max was deployed back into orbit the next day. After a 30-day checkout by the Goddard POCC, the satellite resumed full operation.

Other STS-41-C mission activities included a student experiment located in a middeck locker which found that honeybees can successfully make honeycomb cells in a microgravity environment. Highlights of the mission, including the LDEF deployment and the Solar Max repair, were filmed using an IMAX movie camera, and the results appeared in the 1985 IMAX movie &quot;The Dream is Alive&quot;.

The 6 days, 23 hours, 40 minutes, and 7 seconds mission ended on April 13, 1984, at 5:38 a.m. PST, when &quot;Challenger&quot; landed safely on Runway 17, at Edwards Air Force Base, having completed 108 orbits. &quot;Challenger&quot; was returned to KSC on April 18, 1984.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<text>John Septimus Roe (8 May 1797 – 28 May 1878) was the first Surveyor-General of Western Australia. He was a renowned explorer, a member of Western Australia&#x27;s legislative and executive councils for nearly 40 years, but also a participant in the Pinjarra massacre on 28 October 1834.

==Early life==
John Septimus Roe was born at Newbury, Berkshire on 8 May 1797. He was the seventh son of James Roe, the rector of Newbury. At 10 years of age, Roe was sent to Christ&#x27;s Hospital School (which is still standing today) in London, to study for a career as a school teacher. There, he showed a great aptitude for mathematics, and was selected for training by the Mathematical School, which trained selected students for service in the Royal Navy. He was an outstanding student, and was apprenticed to the Navy at the age of 15.

==Naval service==
John Septimus Roe entered the Naval service on 11 June 1813. His first appointment was as a midshipman on , captained by Sir Christopher Cole. Over the next year, the &quot;Rippon&quot; was engaged in a blockade of the French coast. After the Napoleonic wars ended in 1814, the &quot;Rippon&quot; returned to England, and Roe was appointed as a midshipman to under Captain William Henry Dillon on 17 August. One of their first assignments was to escort a valuable convoy to North America and to then patrol the waters off Newfoundland, protecting the fisheries, under then Governor and Commander-in Chief, Vice Admiral Richard Goodwin Keats. Roe travelled with &quot;Horatio&quot; until January 1817.

At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the prospects for a junior officer were limited. On the recommendation of his former captain, Dillon, his former Commander in chief, Richard Goodwin Keats recognising his aptitude for navigation and cartography provided a letter of recommendation to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office. On 4 February 1817, the Admiralty appointed him to the surveying service in New South Wales, under the command of Captain Phillip Parker King; Roe sailed for New South Wales on the troopship &quot;Dick&quot;, arriving on 3 September 1817.

===New South Wales survey service===
Roe&#x27;s first survey journey as assistant to King was the King expedition of 1817, a rough survey of the northern and north-west coast of Australia. The party sailed from Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) on board the on 21 December 1817, sailing south then west along the south coast of Australia. While anchored at King George Sound in January 1818, Roe nearly drowned in the Kalgan River while trying to circumnavigate Oyster Harbour.

Later, Roe was permitted to name a bay on the northwest coast, which he named Nickol Bay in honour of a man who had been lost overboard. On the north coast, King named a point on the peninsula called Mount Roe in Roe&#x27;s honour. The &quot;Mermaid&quot; eventually returned down the west coast and back along the south coast to Sydney, arriving on 29 July.

At the end of December 1818, the &quot;Mermaid&quot; sailed to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) to survey the Derwent River and the eastern coast to Macquarie Harbour. It was a simple task, and they were back in Sydney by the middle of February 1819.

The King expedition two years later (1819) was expected to last eight or nine months. Their mission was to make a proper survey of the northern coast. After leaving Sydney on 8 May 1819, the &quot;Mermaid&quot; rounded Cape York and crossed the Gulf of Carpentaria. They then spent a substantial period exploring and surveying the coast and islands of Arnhem Land, before surveying Bathurst Island, then exploring and surveying Cambridge Gulf. They then continued their survey of the coast, past Cape Londonderry and westwards as far as the Bonaparte Archipelago. Again they crossed to Timor for provisions, then returned to Sydney.

Roe&#x27;s following voyage the following year was again intended to survey along the north coast, but they ran into violent weather almost as soon as they left Sydney. &quot;Mermaid&quot;″s bowsprit was lost, and she was forced to return to Sydney with three feet of water in the hold. After taking repairs, she left without incident, rounded Cape York and again headed west along the coast of Arnhem Land.

At Goulburn Island, Roe was ambushed by natives and narrowly escaped with his life. Continuing west, &quot;Mermaid&quot; developed such a bad leak that King decided to careen her at a bay that was consequently named Careening Bay. Upon completion of repairs, the &quot;Mermaid&quot; was still found to be leaking, so the decision was taken to return to Sydney along the west and south coasts. Two rivers were discovered in York Sound and traced, one of them being named Roe River in honour of Roe&#x27;s father.

On return to Port Jackson, the &quot;Mermaid&quot; was found to be no longer seaworthy, and was replaced by the brig . In the May 1821 King expedition, Roe sailed in the &quot;Bathurst&quot;. They sailed north up the coast, anchoring at Cairncross Island in bad weather on 30 June. When the sails were hauled in, the fore top-mast stay-sail halliards were accidentally let go, and Roe, who was at the masthead holding onto them, fell onto the deck. He was knocked unconscious, but was not badly hurt; he recovered quickly, but in later years would attribute to this accident the loss of sight in his right eye.

Despite the accident, the expedition proceeded to the west coast, which was surveyed as far as Roebuck Bay. At the end of August, they sailed for Mauritius. After three weeks there, they headed south to King George Sound. They then sailed north up the west coast, surveying as they went, before returning to Port Jackson. During this voyage, Roe was promoted to lieutenant. Back in Sydney, Roe carried out a survey of Sydney Harbour. Despite the capsizing of his boat on 19 August 1822, with the loss of four lives, the survey was completed, to be published by the Admiralty in 1826. Shortly after completion of the survey, Roe returned to England on the &quot;Bathurst&quot;, arriving in June 1823.

Roe received his next commission on 2 February 1824. His instructions were to return to Australia on board the , which arrived in Sydney in July, and the following month was sent to help establish a settlement at Melville Island. The Fort Dundas settlement was officially established on 21 October, and shortly afterwards the &quot;Tamar&quot; sailed for Bombay, where she was refitted and reprovisioned. She then spent some time in surveying and naval duties between Ceylon, India and Rangoon.

Whilst on &quot;Tamar&quot; Roe served in the First Anglo-Burmese War. After a number of other excursions, &quot;Tamar&quot; returned to England, arriving late in November 1827.

==Surveyor-General of Western Australia==

Back in England, Roe spent some time recovering his health, which had been poor, and visiting his family. When the position of Surveyor-General of New South Wales became vacant, he expressed interest, but was informed it had already been filled. Shortly afterwards, however, he was offered the position of Surveyor-General of Western Australia, to be attached to an intended new settlement at the Swan River. Roe accepted on the condition that the position be a civilian appointment, as he was keen to leave the navy.

Having accepted the position, Roe had little time to set his affairs in order, as the official party would soon be leaving on the . He then set about the purchase of equipment for his own requirements and for the surveying office. The Roes embarked upon the barque &quot;Parmelia&quot; on 3 February 1829.

==Marriage and family==
Roe proposed to Matilda Bennett and they married before leaving for Australia in February 1829. Matilda Roe&#x27;s fondness for gardening is claimed to be the reason for the kink between St Georges Terrace and Adelaide Terrace, the main streets through Perth&#x27;s central business district. Their home in Western Australia for many years was &quot;Mandalay&quot;, Middle Swan, later the home of the art dealer and benefactor Claude Hotchin.

Roe and his wife had thirteen children. The fifth son, Frederick Mackie Roe, was second-in-command on Charles Cooke Hunt&#x27;s 1866 expedition to Lake Lefroy in the Coolgardie region.

==Establishing the Swan River Colony==

The &quot;Parmelia&quot; arrived at the Swan River on 1 June 1829. Roe immediately set about making preliminary surveys of the harbour, river and surrounding land. The sites of Perth and Fremantle were chosen on his recommendation, and he was responsible for laying out the towns. During this period, Roe had only a single assistant to help him. Because of the immediate need to survey the harbour and lay out the towns, no rural blocks were surveyed until September. The unexpected arrival of three shiploads of settlers in August, all of whom expected to take up land immediately, put Roe&#x27;s department under extreme pressure. By April the following year 36 ships had brought settlers to the colony, and Roe&#x27;s department had a massive backlog of blocks to survey. Roe later said of this period:
===Exploring Western Australia===
John Septimus Roe conducted numerous exploring expeditions between 1829 and 1849:
* In June 1829, he explored the Swan and Canning River
* In January 1830, he explored the country around Leschenault, the Collie, Ferguson and Preston rivers, Cape Naturaliste and Geographe Bay
* In November 1831, he explored the area around Doubtful Island Bay, the Kalgan River, Albany, Torbay, Wilsons Inlet, and Kojonup
* In 1832 he explored around the Hotham and Williams rivers
* In 1834, he explored to Pinjarra on the Murray River, then Bunbury, Kojonup, Albany and back to Perth; the Pinjarra Massacrein which Roe was involvedoccurred during this expedition
* In 1835, he explored the area around Moorilup on the Kalgan River, then explored the Hay and Sleeman rivers
* In October and November 1835, he was part of the Great Southern Expedition, which explored the country between Perth and Albany by two different routes, with a view to deciding on a route for a road between the two towns
* In October and November the following year, he explored the land east and north from Perth
* In December 1837 he discovered and surveyed Peel Harbour and Warnbro Sound
* In January 1838 he explored the coast between the Swan River and Cape Naturaliste
* In June 1838 he explored from the Swan River to Bunbury via the Murray, Harvey, Collie and Preston rivers, then returned along the base of the Roe and Darling ranges
* In May 1839 he passed through unexplored country on an expedition to rescue from starvation three men who had been part of George Grey&#x27;s disastrous expedition to Shark Bay
* In December the same year, he travelled overland with Governor Hutt to Albany and back, using new routes
* In June 1847, he explored the country around and north of Champion Bay
* From September 1848, he conducted a five-month-long expedition &quot;from Avon River to Stirling Range, and thence eastward to Russell Range and Capes Pasley and Arid on the south coast, and inland, returning by different routes on this occasion and discovering coal on the Fitzgerald and Phillips rivers.&quot; Roe was seriously injured on this expedition, and undertook no more.

==Later life==

With the death of Matilda in 1871, Roe sought permission to retire. At 73 years of age, he had served the colony for more than 40 years.

Already blind in one eye, he became increasingly infirm over the next five years. He died on 28 May 1878, and was honoured by a public funeral and burial at East Perth Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Arguably the most significant legacy left by Roe was the setting aside of Kings Park. As early as December 1830, Roe responded to a request to cut timber below Mount Eliza with: &quot;Mr. Mews to be informed that the neighbourhood of Mt. Eliza is reserved for public purposes&quot;.

Although it is widely accepted that Roe&#x27;s successors Malcolm Fraser and John Forrest were most instrumental in the establishment of Kings Park, Roe was clearly responsible for the initial setting aside of the park.

Roe was the founding president of the Swan River Mechanics&#x27; Institute, holding the position until his death. Both the Western Australian Museum and the State Library of Western Australia emerged from the institute, Roe&#x27;s large scientific collection forming the basis for the museum&#x27;s collection. Jackson (1982) has argued that Roe can be regarded as the founder of both institutions.

During Roe&#x27;s time in term in the Survey Office, he attempted to transcribe every journal of exploration in Western Australia. His &quot;Letterbook of Explorers&#x27; Journals&quot; survives to this day, as a result of which Western Australia has an exceptionally good record of its early explorations, nearly every significant journal being extant from 1827 until Roe&#x27;s retirement in 1870.

In 1955 the State Library obtained on indefinite loan a large collection of log books, diaries and letters left by Roe. The collection constitutes one of the most important private collections ever to be lodged with the library.

John Septimus Roe was honoured in numerous place names: 
* Roebourne, first town in the north of Western Australia
* Mount Roe, near Walpole 
* Roelands, a town near Bunbury
* Roe Range, near Brunswick Junction
* Roe Highway, a major highway in Perth
* Roe&#x27;s poison (&quot;Oxylobium spectabile&quot; Endl.), first collected by Roe at Emu Hill near Narembeen, Western Australia
* Roe Street, Perth
* The electoral district of Roe in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia
* John Septimus Roe Anglican Community School in Mirrabooka
*&quot;Caladenia roei&quot;, a species of orchid cited in Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Flora Australiensis&quot; 
*&quot;Haliotis roei&quot;, Roe&#x27;s abalone, a species of abalone from the southern Australian coast, from Western Australia to Victoria

<doc id="406844" wikidata="Q3256467" url="?curid=406844" title="Unlisted number">
<text>In telephony, an unlisted number (United States, New Zealand), ex-directory number (United Kingdom) silent number, silent line (Australia), or private number (New Zealand, and Canada) is a telephone number that, for a fee, is intentionally not listed in telephone books. Although an unpublished number is not included in the phone book, an unlisted number may be available from the phone company&#x27;s information operator. When used for residential households, they&#x27;re primarily for privacy concerns.

Another form of anonymity is being listed with just a first initial, for those with a relatively common family name; sometimes these listings also lack an address. No fee is charged for initially being so-listed.

==Unlisted numbers as a paid service==
NYNEX was charging $1.95 per month in 1994; in 1976 the same service was 93 cents monthly. In 1971 &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that some users of this service needed it to hide from bill collectors. Silent numbers are often plant test numbers that link to specific tests or control apparatus for network maintenance staff such as ringback and automatic number announcement circuit and are generally not for public use.

In Norway,(and some other countries), the directory services in the 1970s distinguished between secret number, unlisted number and listed number with a hidden address. The first type secret number was typically used by celebrities (in this case the address was hidden as well). The second type unlisted number was not listed in the (paper based) phone book, but was listed on the directory service (a voice call to 018 in the 1970s). Listed number with a hidden address is useful for women&#x27;s shelter etc., where the number needs to be listed, but where the address is to be hidden from the general public. Naturally, there are many changes when directory services became available on the Internet, but this case shows that separate user groups may have different needs to hide various parameters relating to privacy.

These unlisted numbers are made known to call recipients who have caller ID, and are captured and recorded when used to call toll-free numbers.

<text>Plaid () are an English electronic music duo composed of Andy Turner and Ed Handley. They were founding members of The Black Dog and used many other names, such as Atypic (Andy Turner) and Balil (Ed Handley), before settling on Plaid. They have collaborated with singers Mara Carlyle, Nicolette and Björk, and have released records on the labels Clear, Peacefrog, Black Dog Productions, and Warp (along with Trent Reznor&#x27;s label Nothing Records).

Aside from their own material, Plaid have done extensive remix work for many other artists, including Red Snapper, Björk, Goldfrapp, and The Irresistible Force. &quot;Parts in the Post&quot; (2003) and &quot;Stem Sell&quot; (2021) contains a lot of Plaid&#x27;s remix work to date.

Plaid collaborated with video artist Bob Jaroc for their live performances and on the 5.1 audio/visual project entitled &quot;Greedy Baby&quot;. The project was completed on 20 July 2005, and was first shown at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in the South Bank Centre, and subsequently at the BFI Imax cinema in Waterloo, London. &quot;Greedy Baby&quot; was released on DVD from Warp on 26 June 2006.

In 2006, Plaid composed and performed the original score to Michael Arias&#x27; anime film &quot;Tekkonkinkreet&quot;, and then went on to rejoin Arias for his second feature, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, as well as two of his subsequent short films.

In 2009, they contributed a cover of a Plone song to the &quot;Warp20 (Recreated)&quot; compilation.

Plaid&#x27;s music has been used in the LittleBigPlanet series. In 2014, they helped produce some of the soundtrack for LittleBigPlanet 3.

== Musical style ==
Plaid&#x27;s style crosses a number of genres - electronica, dance, ambient, experimental - and is sometimes to referred to by some critics as &quot;post-techno.&quot; They are known to employ a variety of time-signatures in their music and often create syncopated beats and melodies using a variety of real instruments and samples.

<doc id="406856" wikidata="Q984146" url="?curid=406856" title="Katanning, Western Australia">
<text>Katanning is a town located south-east of Perth, Western Australia on the Great Southern Highway. At the census of 2021 the population was 4,057. At the 2016 census, Katanning had a population of 3,687.

==History==
The name &quot;Katanning&quot; is derived from the native name for a camping place. That native name for the camp was &#x27;Kartannup&#x27; - &#x27;Kart&#x27; meaning head and &#x27;annup&#x27; meaning meeting or camping place. In the very early days before town settlement, a big group of traditional custodians lived in the area. When the community of another district would visit annually, Kartannup was the head camp or meeting place. Some sources say that &quot;Kartanup&quot; means &quot;clear pool of sweet water&quot;, or that &quot;Katanning&quot; means &quot;spiders on your back&quot;. Others suggest that the place is named after a local Aboriginal woman.

The first Europeans to explore the Katanning area were Governor James Stirling and Surveyor General John Septimus Roe who travelled through the area in 1835 en route from Perth to Albany.

In about 1870, sandalwood cutters moved into the area but they did not settle. It was not until the development of the Great Southern Railway, a land grant railway built by the West Australian Land Company from Beverley to Albany in 1889, that the township came into existence.

The townsite was initially developed by the West Australian Land Company. The state government purchased the railway and the townsite in 1896 and later formally gazetted the town in 1898, when the population of the town was 226, 107 males and 119 females.

In April 1891 the Premier Roller Flour Mill was opened in the centre of the town by brothers Frederick Henry Piesse and Charles Austin Piesse. The mill provided an important cash market for local wheat growers. Initially the mill supplied flour to the whole of the Albany district, replacing more expensive imports from Adelaide. At that time Albany was Western Australia&#x27;s principal port. The ground-floor street frontages of the mill were converted into shops from the 1930s, including a music shop, butchers&#x27;, dress shops, a barber, and tearooms. By 2008 the building was owned by the Shire of Katanning, which sold it for $1 to a private developer who renovated the by-then dilapidated building and turned it into a hotel and restaurant that opened in 2018.

Katanning remains an important centre on the Great Southern Railway to Albany.

==Features==
A statue of Frederick Henry Piesse (by sculptor Pietro Porcelli) was erected in 1916 and stands beside the railway line in Austral Terrace. The Piesse family constructed a regal mansion which was named &quot;Kobeelya&quot; and after being used for many years as a girls&#x27; boarding school, is now a conference centre managed by the local Baptist church.

Katanning features a unique playground of oversized structures named the &quot;All Ages Playground&quot;. The town has many other attractions, including a state of the art recreation, leisure and function centre.

Katanning has a relatively large Muslim population, of about 350 people, and consequently has a mosque, the Katanning Mosque. The vast majority of local Muslims originated in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and travelled to Katanning to work in the local abattoir, which was established in the late 1970s.

Other religious buildings include churches from Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Seventh Day Adventist, Uniting, and Wesleyan denominations, along with a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness Kingdom Hall.

<doc id="406859" wikidata="Q45578" url="?curid=406859" title="2008 United States presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in the United States on November 4, 2008. The Democratic ticket of Barack Obama, the junior senator from Illinois, and Joe Biden, the senior senator from Delaware, defeated the Republican ticket of John McCain, the senior senator from Arizona, and Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska. Obama became the first African American to be elected to the presidency. This was the first election since 1952 in which neither the incumbent president nor vice president was on the ballot, as well as the first election since 1928 in which neither ran for the nomination.

Incumbent Republican President George W. Bush was ineligible to pursue a third term due to the term limits established by the Twenty-second Amendment. McCain secured the Republican nomination by March 2008, defeating his main challengers Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee, and selected Palin as his running mate. The Democratic primaries were marked by a sharp contest between Obama and the initial front-runner, former first lady and Senator Hillary Clinton, as well as other challengers who dropped out before most of the primaries were held, including Senators John Edwards and Joe Biden. Clinton&#x27;s victory in the New Hampshire primary made her the first woman to win a major party&#x27;s presidential primary. After a long primary season, Obama narrowly secured the Democratic nomination in June 2008 and selected Biden as his running mate.

Bush&#x27;s popularity had significantly declined during his second term, which was attributed to the growing disdain for the Iraq war, his response to Hurricane Katrina, the Abu Ghraib torture controversy, and the 2008 financial crisis. McCain opted to distance himself from Bush and did not campaign with him, nor did Bush appear in person at the 2008 Republican National Convention, although he did endorse McCain. Obama strongly opposed the Iraq war, as well as a troop surge that had begun in 2007, while McCain supported the war. Obama campaigned on the theme that &quot;Washington must change&quot;, while McCain emphasized his experience. McCain&#x27;s decision to suspend his campaign during the height of the financial crisis backfired as voters viewed his response as erratic.

Obama won a decisive victory over McCain, winning the Electoral College and popular vote by sizable margins, as well as flipping nine states that had voted Republican in 2004: Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia, as well as Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. Obama won every state in the Great Lakes region. Obama received the largest share of the popular vote won by a Democrat since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and was the first Democrat to win an outright majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976. At the time, Obama also received the most popular votes in history, a record which would be broken in 2020. 

As of the 2024 presidential election, this is the most recent time a Democrat carried Indiana and North Carolina in a presidential election and the most recent time a Democrat won the male vote in a presidential election. McCain remains the last presidential candidate to receive fewer than 200 electoral votes.

== Background ==

Article Two of the United States Constitution says that the President and Vice President of the United States must be natural-born citizens of the United States, at least 35 years old, and residents of the United States for at least 14 years. Candidates for president typically seek the nomination of a political party, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose a candidate for the position. Traditionally, the primaries are indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party&#x27;s delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party&#x27;s behalf. The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president. President George W. Bush, a Republican and former Governor of Texas, was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the Twenty-second Amendment; in accordance with Section1 of the Twentieth Amendment, his term expired at noon Eastern Standard Time on January 20, 2009.

==Nominations==
===Democratic Party nomination===
==== Candidate ====

====Withdrawn candidates====
==== Before the primaries ====
Media speculation had begun almost immediately after the results of the 2004 presidential election were released. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as the most popular potential Democratic candidates. Nevertheless, the media speculated on several other candidates, including Al Gore, the runner-up in the 2000 election; John Kerry, the runner-up in the 2004 election; John Edwards, Kerry&#x27;s running mate in 2004; Delaware Senator Joe Biden; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson; Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack; and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh.

Edwards was one of the first to formally announce his candidacy for the presidency, on December 28, 2006. This run would be his second attempt at the presidency. Clinton announced intentions to run in the Democratic primaries on January 20, 2007. Obama announced his candidacy on February 10 in his home state of Illinois.

====Early primaries and caucuses====

Early in the year, the support for Barack Obama started to increase in the polls and he passed Clinton for the top spot in Iowa; he ended up winning the caucus in that state, with Edwards coming in second and Clinton in third. Obama&#x27;s win was fueled mostly by first time caucus-goers and Independents and showed voters viewed him as the &quot;candidate of change&quot;. Iowa has since been viewed as the state that jump-started Obama&#x27;s campaign and set him on track to win both the nomination and the presidency. After the Iowa caucus, Biden and Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd withdrew from the nomination contest.

Obama became the new front runner in New Hampshire, when his poll numbers skyrocketed after his Iowa victory. The Clinton campaign was struggling after a huge loss in Iowa and no strategy beyond the early primaries and caucuses. According to &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot;, campaign strategists had &quot;mapped a victory scenario that envisioned the former first lady wrapping up the Democratic presidential nomination by Super Tuesday on Feb. 5.&quot; In what is considered a turning point for her campaign, Clinton had a strong performance at the Saint Anselm College, ABC, and Facebook debates several days before the New Hampshire primary as well as an emotional interview in a public broadcast live on TV. Clinton won that primary by 2% of the vote, contrary to the predictions of pollsters who consistently had her trailing Obama for a few days up to the primary date. Clinton&#x27;s win was the first time a woman had ever won a major American party&#x27;s presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection.

On January 30, 2008, after placing in third in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, Edwards announced that he was suspending his campaign for the presidency, but he did not initially endorse any remaining candidates.

====Super Tuesday====

Super Tuesday was February 5, 2008, when the largest-ever number of simultaneous state primary elections was held. Super Tuesday ended up leaving the Democrats in a virtual tie, with Obama amassing 847 delegates to Clinton&#x27;s 834 from the 23 states that held Democratic primaries.

California was one of the Super Tuesday states that could provide a large number of delegates to the candidates. Obama trailed in the California polling by an average of 6.0% before the primary; he ended up losing that state by 8.3% of the vote. Some analysts cited a large Latino turnout that voted for Clinton as the deciding factor.

The Louisiana, Nebraska, Hawaii, Wisconsin, U.S. Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia primaries and the Washington and Maine caucuses all took place after Super Tuesday in February. Obama won all of them, giving him 10 consecutive victories after Super Tuesday.

====Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania====
On March 4, Hillary Clinton carried Ohio and Rhode Island in the Democratic primaries; some considered these wins, especially Ohio, a &quot;surprise upset&quot; by 10%, although she did lead in the polling averages in both states. She also carried the primary in Texas, but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton.

Only one state held a primary in April. This was Pennsylvania, on April 22. Although Obama made a strong effort to win Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton won that primary by nearly 10%, with approximately 55% of the vote. Obama had outspent Clinton three to one in Pennsylvania, but his comment at a San Francisco fundraiser that small-town Americans &quot;cling&quot; to guns and religion drew sharp criticism from the Clinton campaign and may have hurt his chances in the Keystone State. In addition, Clinton had several advantages in Pennsylvania. Throughout the primary process, she relied on the support of older, white, working class voters. Pennsylvania held a closed primary, which means that only registered Democrats could vote, and, according to Ron Elving of NPR, the established Democratic electorate &quot;was older, whiter, more Catholic and more working-class than in most of the primaries to date.&quot; After Pennsylvania, Obama had a higher number of delegates and popular votes than Clinton did and was still in a stronger position to win the nomination. Clinton, however, had received the endorsement of more superdelegates than Obama.

====Indiana and North Carolina====
On May 6, North Carolina and Indiana held their Democratic presidential primaries. Clinton and Obama campaigned aggressively there before the voting took place. Polling had shown Obama a few points ahead in North Carolina and Clinton similarly leading in Indiana. In the actual results, Obama outperformed the polls by several points in both states, winning by a significant margin in North Carolina and losing by only 1.1% in Indiana (50.56% to 49.44%). After these primaries, most pundits declared that it had become &quot;increasingly improbable,&quot; if not impossible, for Clinton to win the nomination. The small win in Indiana barely kept her campaign alive for the next month. Although she did manage to win the majority of the remaining primaries and delegates, it was not enough to overcome Obama&#x27;s substantial delegate lead.

====Florida and Michigan====
During late 2007, the two parties adopted rules against states&#x27; moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year. For the Republicans, the penalty for this violation was supposed to be the loss of half the state party&#x27;s delegates to the convention. The Democratic penalty was the complete exclusion from the national convention of delegates from states that broke these rules. The Democratic Party allowed only four states to hold elections before February 5, 2008. Clinton won a majority of delegates and popular votes from both states (though 40% voted uncommitted in Michigan) and subsequently led a fight to seat all the Florida and Michigan delegates.

There was some speculation that the fight over the delegates could last until the convention in August. On May 31, 2008, the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic Party reached a compromise on the Florida and Michigan delegate situation. The committee decided to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida at the convention in August, but to only award each a half-vote.

====Clinching the nomination====

The major political party nomination process (technically) continues through June of an election year. In previous cycles, the candidates were effectively chosen by the end of the primaries held in March, but, in this cycle, Barack Obama did not win enough delegates to secure the nomination until June 3, after a 17-month campaign against Hillary Clinton. He had a wide lead in states won, while Clinton had won majorities in several of the larger states. Now, because a form of proportional representation and popular vote decided Democratic state delegate contests, numbers were close between Clinton and Obama. By May, Clinton claimed to hold a lead in the popular vote, but the Associated Press found that her numbers were &quot;accurate only&quot; in one close scenario.

In June, after the last of the primaries had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for president, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed). He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States. For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York. She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7. She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed to do everything she could to help him get elected.

===Republican Party nomination===
Not only was the 2008 election the first time since 1952 that neither the incumbent president nor the incumbent vice president was a candidate in the general election, but it was also the first time since the 1928 election that neither sought his party&#x27;s nomination for president; as Bush was term-limited from seeking another nomination, the unique aspect was Vice President Cheney&#x27;s decision not to seek the Republican nomination. The 2008 election was also the third presidential election since 1896 in which neither the incumbent president, the incumbent vice president, nor a current or former member of the incumbent president&#x27;s Cabinet won the nomination of either major party the others being 1920 and 1952. With no members of the Bush administration emerging as major contenders for the Republican nomination, the Republican race was as open as the Democratic race.

====Candidate====

====Withdrawn candidates====
====Before the primaries====
Immediately after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for president in 2008. In November 2006, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain. The media speculated that Giuliani&#x27;s pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain&#x27;s age and support of the unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies. Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place. Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Giuliani, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, and Texas Representative Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively. McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements. In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul. MSNBC&#x27;s Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007.

====Early primaries/caucuses====
Huckabee, winner of Iowa, had little to no money and hoped for at least a third-place finish in New Hampshire. McCain eventually displaced Rudy Giuliani and Romney as the front runner in New Hampshire. McCain staged a turnaround victory, having been written off by the pundits and polling in single digits less than a month before the race.

With the Republicans stripping Michigan and Florida of half their delegates for moving their primaries into January 2008 against party rules, the race for the nomination was based there. McCain meanwhile managed a small victory over Huckabee in South Carolina, setting him up for a larger and more important victory over Romney in Florida, which held a closed primary on January 29. By this time, after several scandals, no success in the early primaries, and a third-place finish in Florida, Giuliani conceded the nomination and endorsed John McCain the next day.

====Super Tuesday====
McCain was also endorsed in February by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger before the California primary took place on Super Tuesday. This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state&#x27;s primary, which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states. On Super Tuesday, McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 delegates. He also won nearly all of California&#x27;s 173 delegates, the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes. McCain also scored wins in seven other states, picking up 574 delegates. Huckabee was the &quot;surprise performer&quot;, winning 5 states and 218 delegates. Romney won 7 states and 231 delegates. Two days later, Romney suspended his presidential campaign, saying that if he stayed in the race, he would &quot;forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win&quot;. His departure left Huckabee and Paul as McCain&#x27;s only major challengers in the remaining primaries and caucuses. Romney endorsed McCain on February 14.

Louisiana, the District of Columbia, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Washington held primaries in February after Super Tuesday. Despite McCain picking up big victories, Huckabee won Louisiana and Kansas. McCain narrowly carried the Washington caucuses over Huckabee and Paul, who amassed a large showing. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico closed February for the Republicans. After Super Tuesday, John McCain had become the clear front runner, but by the end of February, he still had not acquired enough delegates to secure the nomination. In March, John McCain clinched the Republican nomination after sweeping all four primaries, Texas, Ohio, Vermont, and Rhode Island, putting him over the top of the 1,191 delegates required to win the GOP nomination. Mike Huckabee then conceded the race to McCain, leaving Ron Paul, who had just 16 delegates, as his only remaining opponent. Romney would eventually become the Republican presidential nominee 4 years later, which he then lost to Barack Obama.

===Third party and other nominations===

Along with the Democratic and Republican parties, three other parties nominated candidates with ballot access in enough states to win the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. These were the Constitution Party, the Green Party, and the Libertarian Party. In addition, independent candidate Ralph Nader ran his own campaign.

The Constitution Party nominated writer, pastor, and conservative talk show host Chuck Baldwin for president, and attorney Darrell Castle from Tennessee for vice president. While campaigning, Baldwin voiced his opposition to the Iraq War, the Sixteenth Amendment, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve.

The Green Party nominated former Democratic representative Cynthia McKinney from Georgia for president, and political activist Rosa Clemente from New York for vice president. McKinney campaigned on a platform that supported single-payer universal health care, the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, reparations for African Americans, and the creation of a Department of Peace.

The Libertarian Party nominated former Republican representative Bob Barr from Georgia for president, and his former rival for the Libertarian nomination Wayne Allyn Root from Nevada, for vice president. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barr advocated a reworking or abolition of the income tax and opposed the war in Iraq and the Patriot Act.

==General election campaign==
===Issues===
====Iraq====
Until the onset of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the unpopular Iraq War was a key issue during the campaign. John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it (Obama&#x27;s early and strong opposition to the war helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries, as well as stand out to a war-weary electorate during the general campaign). Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after World War II, his statement that the United States could be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly. Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush.

John McCain&#x27;s support for the troop &#x27;surge&#x27; employed by General David Petraeus, which was one of several factors credited with improving the security situation in Iraq, may have boosted McCain&#x27;s stance on the issue in voters&#x27; minds. McCain (who supported the invasion) argued that his support for the successful surge showed his superior judgment. However, Obama was quick to remind voters that there would have been no need for a &quot;surge&quot; had there been no war at all, thus questioning McCain&#x27;s judgment.

====Bush&#x27;s unpopularity====
George W. Bush had become increasingly unpopular among Americans by late 2005 due in part by the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War domestically and internationally, as well as Bush&#x27;s handling of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. By the time Obama was elected as President of the United States on November 4, 2008, Bush&#x27;s approval rating was in the low to mid 20s and his disapproval grew increasingly significant, being in the high 60s, and even low 70s in some polls. Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among American voters had averaged around 30 percent. In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, but did not make a single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav. Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed in an interview that he voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office.

====Age issue====

Similar to Senator Bob Dole&#x27;s 1996 presidential campaign, one of the more widely leveled charges against McCain was the issue of his age—he turned 72 in August and there was widespread concern about the idea of electing a man who would be 80 years old if he completed two full terms in office (the oldest president, Ronald Reagan, had been a month shy of 78 when he left office in January 1989). In addition, McCain suffered from the ill effects of his captivity in North Vietnam and reportedly had difficulty lifting his arms above his head. His age in particular was considered a liability against the youthful Senator Obama, who was the first Generation Xer to run for president on a major party ticket. McCain for comparison was born before World War II and belonged to the Silent Generation. Much like Bob Dole, McCain attempted to counter these charges by releasing all of his medical records, something Obama did not do. McCain&#x27;s wife Cindy dismissed concerns about his health by arguing that &quot;We went hiking the Grand Canyon last summer and [John] did great and had no trouble keeping up with us.&quot; McCain also appeared at several campaign stops with his still-active 95-year-old mother. In a speech on the House floor, Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha criticized McCain&#x27;s age by saying &quot;Seven presidents have come and gone since I&#x27;ve been in Congress, and I saw the toll the job took on each one of them.&quot; If elected, McCain would have been the first president born in the 1930s. McCain ultimately died in 2018, just one year after the completion of Obama&#x27;s second term.

Like the Clinton campaign in 1996, Obama avoided discussing McCain&#x27;s age directly, instead preferring to simply call his ideas and message &quot;old&quot; and &quot;old hat&quot;. He also made a strong appeal to youth voters and back during his primary contest with Hillary Clinton, had stated &quot;When I watched the feud between the Clintons and [Newt Gingrich] unfold during the 1990s, I was reminded of old quarrels started on college campuses long ago. It&#x27;s time for a new generation to take over.&quot; Obama&#x27;s active use of a Blackberry and other modern technology also stood in contrast to the Arizona Senator&#x27;s admission that he was an infrequent user of email and the internet. McCain&#x27;s service in Vietnam, while marketable to baby boomers, was referred to as &quot;unimportant&quot; to younger voters.
Obama promised &quot;universal health care, full employment, a green America, and an America respected instead of feared by its enemies&quot;.

Polls regularly found the general electorate as a whole divided more evenly between &#x27;change&#x27; and &#x27;experience&#x27; as candidate qualities than the Democratic primary electorate, which split in favor of &#x27;change&#x27; by a nearly 2–1 margin. Advantages for McCain and Obama on experience and the ability to bring change, respectively, remained steady through the November 4 election. However, final pre-election polling found that voters considered Obama&#x27;s inexperience less of an impediment than McCain&#x27;s association with sitting president George W. Bush, an association which was rhetorically framed by the Obama campaign throughout the election season as &quot;more of the same&quot;.

McCain appeared to undercut his line of attack by picking first-term Alaska governor Sarah Palin to be his running mate. Palin had been governor only since 2006, and before that had been a council member and mayor of Wasilla. The choice of Palin was controversial; however, it appeared to solve two pressing concerns—McCain&#x27;s age and health (since a youthful vice president would succeed him to office if he died or became incapacitated) and appealing to right-wing conservatives, a group that had been comparatively unmoved by McCain. Palin also came off as more down-to-earth and relatable to average Americans than McCain, widely criticized as a &quot;Beltway insider&quot;. However, media interviews suggested that Palin lacked knowledge on certain key issues, and they cast doubt among many voters about her qualifications to be vice president or president. In this regard, her inexperience was also a liability when McCain&#x27;s age and health were factored in—there was a higher-than-normal probability of Palin succeeding to the presidency. &quot;One 72-year-old heartbeat away from the presidency&quot; became a popular anti-GOP slogan. She also came under attack on everything from her 17-year-old daughter giving birth to a child out of wedlock to actively participating in hunting moose and other animals. Because of Palin&#x27;s conservative views, there was also concern that she would alienate independents and moderates, two groups that pundits observed McCain would need to win the election.

====Economy====
Polls taken in the last few months of the presidential campaign and exit polls conducted on Election Day showed the economy as the top concern for voters. In the fall of 2008, many news sources were reporting that the economy was suffering its most serious downturn since the Great Depression. During this period, John McCain&#x27;s election prospects fell with several politically costly comments about the economy.

On August 20, John McCain said in an interview with &quot;Politico&quot; that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife, Cindy, owned; &quot;I think—I&#x27;ll have my staff get to you,&quot; he told the media outlet. Both on the stump and in Obama&#x27;s political ad, &quot;Seven&quot;, the gaffe was used to portray McCain as somebody unable to relate to the concerns of ordinary Americans. This out-of-touch image was further cultivated when, on September 15, the day of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, at a morning rally in Jacksonville, Florida, McCain declared that &quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong,&quot; despite what he described as &quot;tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street.&quot; With the perception among voters to the contrary, the comment appeared to cost McCain politically.

On September 24, 2008, after the onset of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, McCain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington so he could help craft a $700 billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry, and he stated that he would not debate Obama until Congress passed the bailout bill. Despite this decision, McCain was portrayed as somebody not playing a significant role in the negotiations for the first version of the bill, which fell short of passage in the House. He eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on September 26, despite Congress&#x27; lack of immediate action on the bill. His ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray McCain as erratic in his response to the economy. Days later, a second version of the original bailout bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with Obama, his vice presidential running mate Joe Biden, and McCain all voting for the measure (Hillary Clinton would as well).

All the aforementioned remarks and campaign issues hurt McCain&#x27;s standing with voters. All these also occurred after the onset of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and after McCain&#x27;s poll numbers had started to fall. Although sound bites of all of these &quot;missteps&quot; were played repeatedly on national television, many pundits and analysts say that the actual financial crisis and economic conditions caused McCain&#x27;s large drop in support in mid-September and severely damaged his campaign.

====Health care====
John McCain&#x27;s proposals focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. At the heart of his plan were tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer. To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain proposed working with states to create what he calls a &quot;Guaranteed Access Plan&quot;.

Barack Obama called for universal health care. His health care plan proposed creating a National Health Insurance Exchange that would include both private insurance plans and a Medicare-like government run option. Coverage would be guaranteed regardless of health status, and premiums would not vary based on health status either. It would have required parents to cover their children, but did not require adults to buy insurance.

Critics of McCain&#x27;s plan argued that it would not significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans, would increase costs, reduce consumer protections and lead to less generous benefit packages. Critics of Obama&#x27;s plan argued that it would increase federal regulation of private health insurance without addressing the underlying incentives behind rising health care spending. Mark Pauly suggested that a combination of the two approaches would work better than either one alone.

A poll released in early November 2008 found that voters supporting Obama listed health care as their second priority; voters supporting McCain listed it as fourth, tied with the war in Iraq. Affordability was the primary health care priority among both sets of voters. Obama voters were more likely than McCain voters to believe government can do much about health care costs.

===Presidential debates===

The United States presidential election of 2008 was sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a bipartisan organization that sponsored four debates that occurred at various locations around the United States (U.S.) in September and October 2008. Three of the debates involved the presidential nominees, and one involved the vice-presidential nominees.

Another debate was sponsored by the Columbia University political union and took place there on October 19. All candidates who could theoretically win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election were invited, and Ralph Nader, Cynthia McKinney, and Chuck Baldwin agreed to attend. Amy Goodman, principal host of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, moderated. It was broadcast on cable by C-SPAN and on the Internet by Break-the-Matrix.

===Campaign costs===

The reported cost of campaigning for president has increased significantly in recent years. One source reported that if the costs for both Democratic and Republican campaigns were added together (for the presidential primary election, general election, and the political conventions), the costs have more than doubled in only eight years ($448.9 million in 1996, $649.5 million in 2000, and $1.01 billion in 2004). In January 2007, Federal Election Commission Chairman Michael E. Toner estimated that the 2008 race would be a $1 billion election, and that to be taken seriously, a candidate would have needed to raise at least $100 million by the end of 2007.

====Expense summary====
According to required campaign filings as reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), 148 candidates for all parties collectively raised $1,644,712,232 and spent $1,601,104,696 for the primary and general campaigns combined through November 24, 2008. The amounts raised and spent by the major candidates, according to the same source, were as follows:
===Notable expressions and phrases===
* Drill, baby, drill: Republican self-described energy policy
* Yes We Can: Obama&#x27;s campaign slogan
* That one: McCain&#x27;s reference to Obama during the 2nd debate.
* Lipstick on a pig: Obama used this phrase to insinuate that any changes that McCain was advocating from the policies of George W. Bush would only be slight modifications of Bush&#x27;s policies but the underlying policies would be the same, and in Obama&#x27;s opinion, bad. Some called it sexist, claiming it was a reference to Sarah Palin, who cracked a joke during the Republican convention that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick.

=== Electoral College forecasts ===
Elections analysts and political pundits issue probabilistic forecasts of the composition of the Electoral College. These forecasts use a variety of factors to estimate the likelihood of each candidate winning the Electoral College electors for that state. Most election predictors use the following ratings:
* &quot;tossup&quot;: no advantage
* &quot;tilt&quot; (used by some predictors): advantage that is not quite as strong as &quot;lean&quot;
* &quot;lean&quot; or &quot;leans&quot;: slight advantage
* &quot;likely&quot;: significant, but surmountable, advantage
* &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;solid&quot;: near-certain chance of victory

Below is a list of states considered by one or more forecast to be competitive; states that are deemed to be &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;solid&quot; by forecasters &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot;, &quot;RealClearPolitics&quot;, and &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;.


==Internet campaigns==

===Fundraising===
Howard Dean collected large contributions through the Internet in his 2004 primary run. In 2008, candidates went even further to reach out to Internet users through their own sites and such sites as YouTube, MySpace, and Facebook.

On December 16, 2007, Ron Paul collected $6 million, more money on a single day through Internet donations than any presidential candidate in US history.

===Promotion===

The 2008 election was the first time that a majority of the voting-age population preferred to get their news from the Internet. Not only did the Internet allow candidates to raise money, but also it gave them a tool to appeal to newer and younger demographics. Political pundits were now evaluating candidates based on their social media following.
Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s victory is credited to his competitive edge in social media and Internet following. Obama had over 2 million American supporters on Facebook and 100,000 followers on Twitter, while McCain attracted only 600,000 Facebook supporters (likes) and 4,600 followers on Twitter. Obama&#x27;s YouTube channel held 115,000 subscribers and more than 97 million video views. Obama had maintained a similar advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary.

Obama&#x27;s edge in social media was crucial to the election outcome. According to a study by the Pew Internet and American Life project, 35 percent of Americans relied on online video for election news. Ten percent of Americans used social networking sites to learn about the election. The 2008 election showed huge increases in Internet use.

Another study done after the election gave a lot of insight on young voters. Thirty-seven percent of Americans ages 18–24 got election news from social networking sites. Almost a quarter of Americans saw something about the election in an online video. YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before. The Republican Party in particular was criticized for not adequately using social media and other means to reach young voters.

Anonymous and semi-anonymous smear campaigns, traditionally done with fliers and push calling, also spread to the Internet. Organizations specializing in the production and distribution of viral material, such as Brave New Films, emerged; such organizations have been said to be having a growing influence on American politics.

==Controversies==

===Voter suppression allegations===

Allegations of voter list purges using unlawful criteria caused controversy in at least six swing states: Colorado, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina. On October 5, 2008, the Republican Lt. Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger, accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties which trend Democratic. Allegations arose in Michigan that the Republican Party planned to challenge the eligibility of voters based on lists of foreclosed homes. The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama filed a lawsuit challenging this. The House Judiciary Committee wrote to the Department of Justice requesting an investigation.

Libertarian candidate Bob Barr filed a lawsuit in Texas to have Obama and McCain removed from the ballot in that state. His campaign alleged that both of the candidates had missed the August 26 deadline to file and had been included on the ballot in violation of Texas election law. Neither Obama nor McCain had been confirmed as the candidate of their respective parties at the time of the deadline. The Texas Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit without explanation.

In Ohio, identified by both parties as a key state, allegations surfaced from both Republicans and Democrats that individuals from out of state were moving to the state temporarily and attempting to vote despite not meeting the state&#x27;s requirement of permanent residency for more than 29 days. The Franklin County Board of Elections referred 55 cases of possible voting irregularities to the local prosecutor. Three groups attracted particular notice: &#x27;Vote from Home,&#x27; &#x27;Vote Today Ohio,&#x27; and &#x27;Drop Everything and Come to Ohio.&#x27; Vote from Home attracted the most attention when thirteen of the group&#x27;s members moved to the same location in eastern Columbus. Members of the group organized by Marc Gustafson, including several Marshall and Rhodes scholars studying at Oxford University, settled with Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O&#x27;Brien to have their challenged ballots withdrawn. The Obama campaign and others alleged that members of the McCain campaign had also voted without properly establishing residency. Since 1953, only six people in Ohio have gone to prison for illegal voting.

===Media bias===
Republicans and independents leveled significant criticism at media outlets&#x27; coverage of the presidential election season. An October 22, 2008 Pew Research Center poll estimated 70% of registered voters believed journalists wanted Barack Obama to win the election, as opposed to 9% for John McCain. Another Pew survey, conducted after the election, found that 67% of voters thought that the press fairly covered Obama, versus 30% who viewed the coverage as unfair. Regarding McCain, 53% of voters viewed his press coverage as fair versus 44% who characterized it as unfair. Among affiliated Democrats, 83% believed the press fairly covered Obama; just 22% of Republicans thought the press was fair to McCain.

At the February debate, Tim Russert of NBC News was criticized for what some perceived as disproportionately tough questioning of Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton. Among the questions, Russert had asked Clinton, but not Obama, to provide the name of the new Russian President (Dmitry Medvedev). This was later parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In October 2007, liberal commentators accused Russert of harassing Clinton over the issue of supporting drivers&#x27; licenses for illegal immigrants.

On April 16, ABC News hosted a debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Moderators Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos were criticized by viewers, bloggers and media critics for the poor quality of their questions. Many viewers said they considered some of the questions irrelevant when measured against the importance of the faltering economy or the Iraq War. Included in that category were continued questions about Obama&#x27;s former pastor, Senator Hillary Clinton&#x27;s assertion that she had to duck sniper fire in Bosnia more than a decade ago, and Senator Obama&#x27;s not wearing an American flag pin. The moderators focused on campaign gaffes and some believed they focused too much on Obama. Stephanopoulos defended their performance, saying &quot;Senator Obama was the front-runner&quot; and the questions were &quot;not inappropriate or irrelevant at all.&quot;

In an op-ed published on April 27, 2008, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Elizabeth Edwards wrote that the media covered much more of &quot;the rancor of the campaign&quot; and &quot;amount of money spent&quot; than &quot;the candidates&#x27; priorities, policies and principles.&quot; Author Erica Jong commented that &quot;our press has become a sea of triviality, meanness and irrelevant chatter.&quot; A Gallup poll released on May 29, 2008, also estimated that more Americans felt the media was being harder on Hillary Clinton than they were towards Barack Obama. &quot;Time&quot; magazine columnist Mark Halperin stated that the media during the 2008 election had a &quot;blind, almost slavish&quot; worship of Obama.

The Project for Excellence in Journalism and Harvard University&#x27;s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy conducted a study of 5,374 media narratives and assertions about the presidential candidates from January 1 through March 9, 2008. The study found that Obama received 69% favorable coverage and Clinton received 67%, compared to only 43% favorable media coverage of McCain. Another study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University found the media coverage of Obama to be 72% negative from June 8 to July 21 compared to 57% negative for McCain. An October 29 study found 29% of stories about Obama to be negative, compared to 57% of stories about McCain being negative.

== Timeline ==
==Conduct==
Election Day was on November 4, 2008. The majority of states allowed early voting, with all states allowing some form of absentee voting. Voters cast votes for listed presidential candidates but were actually selecting representatives for their state&#x27;s Electoral College slate.

A McCain victory quickly became improbable as Obama amassed early wins in his home state of Illinois, the Northeast, and the critical battleground states of Ohio (which no Republican has ever been elected president without winning) and Pennsylvania by 9:30 pm Eastern Standard Time. Obama won the entire Northeast by comfortable margins and the Great Lakes states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota by double digits. McCain held on to traditionally Republican states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska (though notably, Obama did win an electoral vote from Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd congressional district), Kansas, Oklahoma, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, and his home state of Arizona. Out of the southern states, Obama won Florida, North Carolina, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Obama also won the hotly contested states of Iowa and New Mexico, which Al Gore had won in 2000 and George W. Bush in 2004. Also, for only the second time since 1936 (1964 being the other), Indiana went Democratic, giving Obama all eight Great Lakes states, the first time a presidential candidate had won all of them since Richard Nixon in 1972.

CNN and Fox News called Virginia for Obama shortly before 11:00 pm, leaving him only 50 electoral votes shy of victory with only six West Coast states (California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Alaska, and Hawaii) still voting. All American networks called the election in favor of Obama at 11:00 pm as the polls closed on the West Coast. Obama was immediately declared the winner in California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii, McCain won Idaho, and the Electoral College totals were updated to 297 for Obama and 146 for McCain (270 are needed to win). McCain gave a concession speech half an hour later in his hometown of Phoenix, Arizona. Obama appeared just before midnight Eastern Time in Grant Park, Chicago, in front of a crowd of 250,000 people to deliver his victory speech.

Following Obama&#x27;s speech, spontaneous street parties broke out in cities across the United States including Philadelphia, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Chicago, Columbus, Detroit, Boston, Los Angeles, Portland, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Denver, Atlanta, Madison, and New York City and around the world in London; Bonn; Berlin; Obama, Japan; Toronto; Rio de Janeiro; Sydney; and Nairobi.

Later on election night, after Obama was named the winner, he picked up several more wins in swing states in which the polls had shown a close race. These included Florida, Indiana, Virginia, and the western states of Colorado and Nevada. All of these states had been carried by Bush in 2004. North Carolina and the bellwether state of Missouri remained undecided for several days. Eventually Obama was declared the winner in North Carolina and McCain in Missouri, with Obama pulling out a rare win in Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. This put the projected electoral vote count at 365 for Obama and 173 for McCain. Obama&#x27;s victories in the populous swing states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Virginia contributed to his decisive win. The presidential electors cast their ballots for president and vice president, and Congress tallied these votes on January 8, 2009.

===Turnout===

The voter turnout for this election was broadly predicted to be high by American standards, and a record number of votes were cast. The final tally of total votes counted was 131.3 million, compared to 122.3 million in 2004 (which also boasted the highest record since 1968, the last presidential election before the voting age was lowered to 18). Expressed as a percentage of eligible voters, 131.2 million votes could reflect a turnout as high as 63.0% of eligible voters, which would be the highest since 1960. This 63.0% turnout rate is based on an estimated eligible voter population of 208,323,000. Another estimate puts the eligible voter population at 213,313,508, resulting in a turnout rate of 61.6%, which would be the highest turnout rate since 1968.

Broken down by age group, voters under 35 voted for Obama by a large majority with McCain most popular among voters over 60. Voters between 35 and 59 were nearly split 50/50 between the two candidates.

American University&#x27;s Center for the Study of the American Electorate released a report on November 6, 2008, two days after the election, which concluded that the anticipated increase in turnout had failed to materialize. That report was the basis for some news articles that indicated voter turnout failed to meet expectations. When the remaining votes were counted after the release of the report, the total number of votes cast in the presidential election was raised to 131.2 million, which surpassed the American University report&#x27;s preliminary estimate of 126.5 to 128.5 million voters by a factor of between 2% and 4%.

The election saw increased participation from African Americans, who made up 13.0% of the electorate, versus 11.1% in 2004. According to exit polls, over 95% of African Americans voted for Obama. This played a critical role in Southern states such as North Carolina. 74% of North Carolina&#x27;s registered African American voters turned out, as opposed to 69% of North Carolinians in general, with Obama carrying 100% (with rounding) of African-American females and African Americans age 18 to 29, according to exit polling. This was also the case in Virginia, where much higher turnout among African Americans propelled Obama to victory in the former Republican stronghold. Even in southern states in which Obama was unsuccessful, such as Georgia and Mississippi, due to large African American turnout he was much more competitive than John Kerry in 2004.

===Ballot access===

No other candidate had ballot access in enough states to win 270 electoral votes. All six candidates appeared on the ballot for a majority of the voters, while the 17 other listed candidates were available to no more than 30% of the voters.

The following candidates and parties had ballot listing or write-in status in more than one state:
* Alan Keyes (America&#x27;s Independent Party) received 47,746 votes; listed in three states: Colorado and Florida, plus California (listed as American Independent), and also had write-in status in Kentucky, Ohio, Texas, and Utah.
* Ron Paul received 42,426 votes; listed in Louisiana (Louisiana Taxpayers) and in Montana (Constitution), with write-in status in California.
* Gloria La Riva (Party for Socialism and Liberation) received 6,808 votes nationally; listed in 12 states: Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
* Brian Moore (Socialist Party, see Brian Moore presidential campaign, 2008) received 6,538 votes; listed in eight states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin, and Tennessee (independent) and Vermont (Liberty Union). He also filed for write-in status in 17 other states: Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming.
* Róger Calero (Socialist Workers Party) received 5,151 votes; listed in ten states. He was listed by name in Delaware, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont. James Harris was listed as his stand-in in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, and Washington, and also had write-in status in California.
* Charles Jay (Boston Tea Party) received 2,422 votes; listed in Colorado and Florida, and in Tennessee (as independent), with write-in status in Arizona, Montana, and Utah.
* Tom Stevens (Objectivist) received 755 votes; listed in Colorado and Florida.
* Gene Amondson (Prohibition) received 653 votes; listed in Colorado, Florida, and Louisiana.
* Jonathan Allen (Heartquake) received 483 votes; listed only in Colorado, with write-in status in Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Texas, and other states.

The following candidates (parties) were listed on the ballot in only one state:
* Richard Duncan (Independent) – Ohio; 3,905 votes.
* John Joseph Polachek (New Party) Illinois; 1,149 votes.
* Frank McEnulty (New American Independent) – Colorado (listed as unaffiliated); 829 votes.
* Jeffrey Wamboldt (We the People) – Wisconsin; 764 votes.
* Jeff Boss (Vote Here) – New Jersey; 639 votes.
* George Phillies – New Hampshire (also listed with the label Libertarian); 531 votes.
* Ted Weill (Reform) – Mississippi; 481 votes.
* Bradford Lyttle (U.S. Pacifist) – Colorado; 110 votes.

In Nevada, 6,267 votes were cast for &quot;None of These Candidates&quot;. In the three states that officially keep track of &quot;blank&quot; votes for president, 103,193 votes were recorded as &quot;blank&quot;. More than 100,000 write-in votes were cast and recorded for a scattering of other candidates, including 62 votes for &quot;Santa Claus&quot; (in ten states) and 11 votes for &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; (in five states).

According to the Federal Election Commission, an unusually high number of &quot;miscellaneous&quot; write-ins were cast for president in 2008, including 112,597 tallied in the 17 states that record votes for non-listed candidates. There were more presidential candidates on the ballot than at any other time in U. S. history, except for the 1992 election, which also had 23 candidates listed in at least one state.

==Results==
Of the 3,154 counties/districts/independent cities making returns, McCain won the most popular votes in 2,270 (71.97%) while Obama carried 884 (28.03%).

Popular vote totals are from the official Federal Election Commission report. The results of the electoral vote were certified by Congress on January 8, 2009.




===Results by state===

The following table records the official vote tallies for each state for those presidential candidates who were listed on ballots in enough states to have a theoretical chance for a majority in the Electoral College. State popular vote results are from the official Federal Election Commission report. The column labeled &quot;Margin&quot; shows Obama&#x27;s margin of victory over McCain (the margin is negative for states and districts won by McCain).


Note: Maine and Nebraska each allow for their electoral votes to be split between candidates. In both states, two electoral votes are awarded to the winner of the statewide race and one electoral vote is awarded to the winner of each congressional district.

==Analysis==
Obama, having a white mother and Kenyan father of the Luo ethnic group, became the first African American as well as the first biracial president. Several black people had previously run for president, including Shirley Chisholm, Jesse Jackson, Lenora Fulani, Carol Moseley Braun, Alan Keyes, and Al Sharpton, though Obama was the first one ever to win the nomination of a major party, let alone the general election. The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history in which neither candidate was a white Protestant, as Biden is Roman Catholic and the first Roman Catholic to be elected vice president; all previous tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984). The Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning ticket consisting of two sitting senators since 1960 (John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents Bush and Cheney), and Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy. Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. Obama became the first Northern Democrat to win any state in the former Confederacy since Hubert Humphrey won Texas in 1968. This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major-party nominees was the incumbent president or vice-president.

Prior to the election, commentators discussed whether Senator Obama would be able to redraw the electoral map by winning states that had been voting for Republican candidates in recent decades. In many ways, he was successful. He won every region of the country by double digits except the South, which John McCain won by nine percent, although Obama nonetheless carried Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, Florida, and Virginia (the South as defined by the US Census Bureau). McCain won every state in the Deep South, where white voters had generally supported Republican candidates by increasingly large margins in the previous few decades. Obama won all of the 2004 swing states (states that either Kerry or Bush won by less than 5%) by a margin of 8.5 percent or more except for Ohio, which he carried by 4.5 percent.

Obama also defied political bellwethers, becoming the first person to win the presidency while losing Missouri since 1956 and while losing Kentucky and Tennessee since 1960. He was the first Democrat to ever win the presidency without carrying Missouri, to win without carrying Arkansas since that state joined the Union in 1836, and the first to win without West Virginia since 1916 (and, because one West Virginia elector had voted Democratic in 1916, Obama became the first Democrat to win the White House without any of the state&#x27;s electors since its founding in 1863). Indiana and Virginia voted for the Democratic nominee for the first time since 1964, as did a solitary electoral vote from Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. Indiana would return to being a reliably red state in subsequent elections; Virginia, however, has been won by Democrats in every presidential election since and would grow increasingly Democratic at the state level. North Carolina, which Obama was the first Democrat to carry since 1976, would return to the Republican column in the following elections, though only by narrow margins each time.

Obama was also relatively competitive in some traditionally Republican states he lost, notably Montana, which he lost by under 3%, and Georgia, which he lost by just 5%. He is also the only 21st-century Democrat to lose North Dakota and South Dakota by just single digits.

This was the first presidential election in which Nebraska split its electoral votes between two candidates. Together with Maine, which would not split its votes until 2016, Nebraska is one of two states that allow a split in electoral votes without faithless electors: a candidate receives one electoral vote for each congressional district won (Nebraska has three, Maine two), while the statewide winner receives an additional two electoral votes. Obama won the electoral vote from Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, largely comprising the city of Omaha. Nebraska&#x27;s other four electoral votes went to John McCain. This would not happen again until 2020.

, this election is the last time that Indiana or North Carolina voted Democratic, and is also the most recent election where one of the nominees has since died. Until 2024 this was also the most recent election in which any of the major presidential nominees had any military experience.

This election exhibited the continuation of some of the polarization trends evident in the 2000 and 2004 elections. McCain won whites 55–43 percent, while Obama won blacks 95–4 percent, Hispanics 67–31 percent, and Asians 62–35 percent. Voters aged 18–29 voted for Obama by 66–32 percent while elderly voters backed McCain 53–45 percent. The 25-year age gap between McCain and Obama was the widest in U.S. presidential election history among the top two candidates.

<doc id="406877" wikidata="Q343983" url="?curid=406877" title="Henry Winkler">
<text>Henry Franklin Winkler (born October 30, 1945) is an American actor, producer, director, and author. Widely known as Arthur &quot;Fonzie&quot; Fonzarelli on the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1974–1984), Winkler has distinguished himself as a character actor for roles on stage and screen. His many accolades include three Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards and two Critics Choice Awards.

Winkler studied theater at both Emerson College and the Yale School of Drama and spent a year and half with the Yale Repertory Theater. After getting cast in a small role in &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, he became a star playing the role of &quot;Fonzie&quot; on the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1974–1984). He then helped develop the original &quot;MacGyver&quot; television series and directed &quot;Memories of Me&quot; (1988) and &quot;Cop and a Half&quot; (1993).

Winkler acted in films such as &quot;Heroes&quot; (1977), &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1982), &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), &quot;The Waterboy&quot; (1998), &quot;Holes&quot; (2003), &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; (2021), and &quot;Black Adam&quot; (2022). He also found a career resurgence in television portraying humorous characters such as Barry Zuckerkorn in &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2003–2019), Eddie R. Lawson in &quot;Royal Pains&quot; (2010–2016), Dr. Saperstein in &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2013–2015), and Gene Cousineau in &quot;Barry&quot; (2018–2023). The last earned him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Winkler was a member of the main cast of the reality series &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot; (2016–2018).

Winkler has drawn upon his childhood struggles with dyslexia to co-write the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Hank Zipzer&quot; (2003–2010), which was adapted into the &quot;Hank Zipzer&quot; television series (2014–2016) in which Winkler appears as Mr. Rock. He has also written three memoirs: &quot;The Other Side of Henry Winkler: My Story&quot; (1976), &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Met an Idiot on the River&quot; (2011), and &quot;Being Henry: The Fonz ... and Beyond&quot; (2023).

== Early life ==
=== 1939–1945: Family history ===

Winkler&#x27;s parents, Ilse Anna Marie (née Hadra) and businessman Harry Irving Winkler were German Jews living in Berlin during the rise of Nazi Germany. By 1939, rising hostilities against Jews led his father to conclude that it was time to leave Germany. He arranged to take his wife on a six-week business trip to the United States. Although Winkler&#x27;s uncle Helmut was supposed to join them, at the last minute he decided to leave at a later date, and was eventually murdered during the Holocaust. Soon after arriving, his parents settled in New York City, where his father established a new version of his German company, which bought and sold wood.

=== 1945–1963: Early life and education ===
Henry Franklin Winkler was born on October 30, 1945, on the West Side of New York City&#x27;s Manhattan borough. The &quot;H&quot; in his first name is a reference to his Uncle Helmut, while his middle name refers to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He has an older sister named Beatrice.

Although his family did not keep kosher, Winkler was raised in the traditions of Conservative Judaism. During his childhood, Winkler and his family spent their summers at Lake Mahopac, New York, and as a teenager he was a water skiing instructor at Blue Mountain camps.

While growing up, Winkler had a difficult relationship with his father, who wanted him to continue the family business. When his father grew frustrated with Winkler&#x27;s focus on acting, he would ask his son why he had brought the business over from Germany to the United States. Winkler would respond: &quot;Besides being chased by the Nazis, Dad, was there a bigger reason than that?&quot;

==== Difficulties in school ====
Winkler first attended P.S. 87 on West 78th Street, Manhattan, and then the McBurney School on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. Although he was &quot;outgoing&quot; and &quot;the class comedian&quot; in school, he also lived in a state of &quot;constant anxiety&quot; over his struggles with schoolwork. His parents were perpetually frustrated by his poor grades, referred to him as &quot;dummer Hund&quot; (dumb dog), and repeatedly punished him for his inability to excel in school. Winkler has said that this time period was &quot;excruciating&quot; as his &quot;self-image was almost nonexistent&quot;. In addition, his consistently poor academic performance made it difficult to be involved in the theater, as he was &quot;grounded most of my high school career&quot; and was almost never academically eligible. However, he did manage to appear in two theatrical productions: &quot;Billy Budd&quot; when he was in the eighth grade and &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; in the eleventh grade.

Although Winkler graduated from the McBurney School in 1963, he was not allowed to attend graduation, as he had to repeat geometry for the fourth time during summer school. After finally passing the course, he received his diploma in the mail.

=== 1963–1967: Emerson College ===
Winkler applied to 28 colleges but was admitted to only two of them. He enrolled in Emerson College in Boston in 1963, where he majored in theater and minored in child psychology, as he considered becoming a child psychologist if he did not succeed as an actor. He was also a member of the Alpha Pi Theta fraternity, and appeared in Emerson&#x27;s production of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; as the title character. Winkler later recalled that he had nearly failed his first and second years but managed to stay for four years and graduated in 1967. In 1978, Emerson awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL).

=== 1967–1970: Yale School of Drama ===
During his senior year at Emerson, Winkler decided to audition for the Yale School of Drama. Although his then-undiagnosed dyslexia led to his forgetting the Shakespearean monologue he was supposed to perform, forcing him to improvise, Winkler was still admitted to the M.F.A. program in 1967.

He appeared in &quot;They Told Me That You Came This Way&quot;; &quot;Any Day Now, Any Day Now&quot;; and &quot;The Bacchae&quot; (as a member of the chorus). During the summers, he and his Yale classmates stayed in New Haven and opened a summer stock theater called the &quot;New Haven Free Theater&quot;. They performed various plays including &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, where he portrayed the title role, and &quot;Just Add Water&quot; for improv night. He also performed in the political piece, &quot;The American Pig&quot; at the Joseph Papp Public Theater for the New York Shakespeare Festival in New York City, with classmates James Keach, James Naughton, and Jill Eikenberry. In addition, he also appeared in a number of Yale Repertory Theatre productions while still a student, including, &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, &quot;The Rhesus Umbrella&quot;, &quot;Don Juan&quot;, &quot;Endgame&quot;, and &quot;The Physicists&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Sweeney Agonistes&quot; and &quot;Hughie&quot;. Winkler would later credit his time at Yale as critical to his future success.

Out of his original cohort of 25 actors at Yale, Winkler was one of 11 who graduated when he received his MFA in 1970. Over two decades later, in May 1996, he served as the Senior Class Day Speaker for Yale University&#x27;s graduating seniors.

== Career ==
=== 1970–1973: Early career ===
====Yale Repertory Theatre company====
After receiving his MFA in 1970, Winkler was one of three students from his graduating class of 11 who were invited to become a part of the Yale Repertory Theatre company. He joined on June 30, 1970, was paid $173 a week, and appeared throughout the 1970–71 season. He performed in &quot;Story Theater Reportory&quot;, &quot;Gimpel the Fool&quot; and &quot;Saint Julian the Hospitaler&quot; and &quot;Olympian Games&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone?&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and &quot;Woyzeck and Play&quot;. He also appeared in a double feature of two works by Bertolt Brecht, &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins (ballet chanté)&quot;, and &quot;The Little Mahagonny&quot; during May–June 1971 and January 20–29, 1972.

====New York and California====

In the fall of 1971, Winkler was invited to be a part of the play &quot;Moonchildren&quot; which would open at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. Three weeks into rehearsals, director Alan Schneider fired him as Winkler had been hired to fill the space until the actor that Schneider really wanted was available. At the time, Winkler was certain that because he had been fired, he would never be hired as an actor again.

Winkler moved back to New York, and began to audition for plays, movies, and commercials. He was able to earn a living through performing in commercials, thus, he was able to perform with the Manhattan Theater Club for free.

Winkler&#x27;s first appearance on Broadway was as &quot;John&quot; in &quot;42 Seconds from Broadway&quot;, a play that opened and closed on March 11, 1973. He swore to himself that one day he would &quot;make that right&quot;. By 1973, he had roles in two independent films, &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot; and &quot;Crazy Joe&quot;. He also performed with the improv group, &quot;Off the Wall New York&quot;. He continued to feel anxiety, however, with the process of cold reading during auditions and depended upon compensation strategies.

By 1973, his agent told him that it was time to leave New York and explore possibilities in California. Although Winkler was initially resistant, thinking he was not a good fit for Hollywood, his agent was persistent. Winkler ultimately decided that he had earned enough money through his work in commercials to try Hollywood for one month. He and his &quot;Lords of Flatbush&quot; co-star, Perry King, thus traveled to Los Angeles on September 18, 1973. After meeting with his agency&#x27;s west coast branch, and spending five days going to auditions, Winkler was hired for a small part on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, appearing in Season 4, Episode 10, &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;.

=== 1973–1984: &quot;Happy Days&quot; and stardom ===
During his second week in Los Angeles, Winkler auditioned for the part of Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli, better known as &quot;Fonzie&quot; or &quot;The Fonz&quot;, on a new show called &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Although he was an unknown and not the first choice for the role, he was asked to return after his first audition for a second one in costume. In costume, and with a different voice, Winkler said his six lines, threw his script in the air, and left the room. He was offered the role on his birthday, and accepted it based on his condition that the producers would show who the character was when he took his jacket off. Winkler appeared on the first episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; in January 1974, and was with the series continuously until it ended in July 1984.

&quot;The Fonz&quot; was initially written as a minor role and developed as the foil for the central protagonist of the series, Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard). Winkler made his own interpretation of the character during the first episode, choosing not to comb his hair, chew gum, or keep a box of cigarettes rolled in his sleeve like actors typically did with this type of character. Although he tried to explain this philosophy to the producers, he was told he had to follow the script and comb his hair. He thus stood at the mirror, motioned in a way that suggested &quot;Hey I don&#x27;t have to because it&#x27;s perfect,&quot; and in doing so, created the seminal moment which defined the character. ABC executives did not want to see Fonzie wearing leather, thinking it would imply that the character was a criminal. Thus, during the first season, Winkler wore two different windbreaker jackets, one of which was green. Director Garry Marshall argued with the executives about the jacket, and eventually they made a compromise: Fonzie could wear the leather jacket, but only in scenes with his motorcycle. Marshall thus made certain that his motorcycle was written into every scene. In reality, Winkler did not know how to ride a motorcycle. As he almost crashed it the first time he tried, he subsequently never rode the motorcycle during the series.

By the middle of the second season in December 1974, &quot;The Fonz&quot; began his transition as a breakout character when he was featured as the central protagonist in the episode, &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Christmas&quot;. By the third season, he became the lead of the series, as the storylines shifted away from the original protagonist, Richie Cunningham, to &quot;The Fonz&quot;. Winkler recalled in a 2018 interview that he directly addressed the issue with Ron Howard, who portrayed Cunningham. According to Winkler, Howard told him that although he &quot;was signed on as the star, you did nothing except be as good as you could be. It&#x27;s good for the show, we&#x27;re friends.&quot; In 2021, Howard reiterated these points by stating that Winkler had been &quot;sort of a big brother&quot; to him.

In a 2018 interview with Winkler, journalist Michael Schneider suggests that it was at this point that the character &quot;became the biggest icon on television&quot; at that time. Winkler responded by stating that he &quot;went from somebody who had no sense of self&quot; to a situation that was &quot;scary&quot;. He has also admitted that while he shares some characteristics with &quot;The Fonz&quot; such as loyalty to friends and an undercurrent of anger that he drew from his struggles with school as a child, they were fundamentally different from one another.
During his decade on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, Winkler also appeared in a variety of roles in film and on television. In film, he appeared in &quot;Heroes&quot; (1977) with Harrison Ford and Sally Field and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. He later appeared in Carl Reiner&#x27;s &quot;The One and Only&quot; (1978) and in Ron Howard&#x27;s 1982 directorial debut, &quot;Night Shift&quot; with Shelley Long before she appeared in &quot;Cheers&quot; and a then-unknown Michael Keaton. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his work in &quot;Night Shift&quot;.

In television, he served as executive producer and host for the 50-minute television version of the documentary, &quot;Who Are the DeBolts? And Where Did They Get Nineteen Kids?&quot; (1978), which was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series or Special. He was also an executive producer for the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special: Run, Don&#x27;t Walk&quot; (1981), based on the novel of the same name by Harriet May Savitz, and featuring his &quot;Happy Days&quot; co-star, Scott Baio. He further directed Baio in the 13th episode of the &quot;Happy Days&quot; spin-off, &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot;, also starring Erin Moran.

In addition, Winkler starred in &quot;An American Christmas Carol&quot; (1979), and served as a co-host for the &quot;Music for UNICEF Concert&quot; (1979). He also appeared as &quot;Fonzie&quot; on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; to promote the letter &quot;A&quot; (ayyyy), later recalling that it was &quot;the only time I ever appeared as the Fonz on something else. I had a strict rule about that, but they asked me and it was my pleasure.&quot;

=== Post &quot;Happy Days&quot; ===
After &quot;Happy Days&quot; ended in 1984, Winkler was typecast, and could not get acting roles until 1991. He later stated that his &quot;agent would put me out there and people would say, &#x27;You know, he&#x27;s great, he&#x27;s a wonderful guy, really good actor. Funny, So funny. But he was the Fonz.&#x27;&quot; Winkler, who desired to be a working actor, felt &quot;rudderless&quot; during this period; desiring to continue a presence in the industry, he started the production company Fair Dinkum Productions in the late 1970s. The name &quot;&quot; was taken from Australian English slang, meaning something is &quot;honest&quot; or &quot;authentic&quot;. In 1987, he inked a new feature film and development pact with the studio.

In 1984, Winkler directed, and was executive producer for, the &quot;CBS Schoolbreak Special: &quot;All the Kids Do It&quot;&quot; starring Scott Baio, which won the 1985 Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Special and was nominated for the 1985 Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Directing in Children&#x27;s Programming. In addition to a few episodes of television sitcoms that he directed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Winkler directed his first theatrical release in 1988, &quot;Memories of Me&quot; with Billy Crystal. In 1993, he directed his second theatrical release, &quot;Cop and a Half&quot;, a film produced by Ron Howard&#x27;s company, Imagine Entertainment, and starring Burt Reynolds.

Winkler was an executive producer for Rob Reiner&#x27;s second film as a director, &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; (1985). He was also the executive producer for the original &quot;MacGyver&quot; television series, which won the Genesis Award for Best TV Drama in 1991, and for &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Gun&quot;, which won the Bronze Wrangler in 1998. In 1988, he was the executive producer for the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special: A Family Again&quot; starring Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker. In addition, he was the executive producer for a number of series, including &quot;Sightings&quot; and &quot;So Weird&quot;. In 2002, he partnered with Michael Levitt to revamp and update The &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; for the fifth season of the 1998 reboot. It was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show in 2003.

=== 1991–2003: Acting roles ===
Winkler returned to acting in the early 1990s. He starred in the 1991 television film, &quot;Absolute Strangers&quot;, and in the short-lived 1994 television series &quot;Monty&quot; with David Schwimmer (before his debut on &quot;Friends&quot;). He also starred in the 1994 television film &quot;One Christmas&quot;, with Katharine Hepburn in her last role and Swoosie Kurtz.

In 1996, he appeared in his friend Wes Craven&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Scream&quot; as foul-mouthed high school principal Arthur Himbry. His role was uncredited, however, as the producers were concerned that he would only be seen as The Fonz, and thus distract from the film. After the screening, he received positive feedback for his role and was subsequently asked to participate in the publicity campaign for &quot;Scream&quot;.

In 2000, Winkler was nominated for a Primetime Emmy, Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, for his portrayal of Dr. Henry Olson in three episodes of &quot;The Practice&quot;. He also portrayed Stanley Yelnats III in &quot;Holes&quot; (2003).

====Work with Adam Sandler====
Winkler began to collaborate with Adam Sandler in the 1990s, after Sandler included Fonzie in the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit, &quot;The Chanukah Song&quot; (1994). Winkler called Sandler to thank him, which led first to a friendship, and later to the role of Coach Klein in the 1998 film &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, and as Sandler&#x27;s father in &quot;Click&quot; (2006). He also made cameo appearances in &quot;Little Nicky&quot; (2000), &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot; (2008), and &quot;Sandy Wexler&quot; (2017).

====Work with John Ritter====

Winkler worked on a few projects with his longtime friend, actor John Ritter, whom he first met in 1978 at ABC&#x27;s 25th anniversary party, when Winkler was still on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and Ritter was Jack Tripper on the television series &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. He directed Ritter in the 1986 television movie &quot;A Smoky Mountain Christmas&quot; starring Dolly Parton, and in 1993, they co-starred in the made-for-television movie, &quot;The Only Way Out&quot;.

Later in 1999, Neil Simon gave Winkler the chance to be involved with his first theatrical production since 1973, when he asked him to do a read-through of &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;. Given the problems he had with cold-readings, Winkler initially panicked. However, he asked for the script in advance in order to memorize it, and managed to get through the reading. Simon eventually contacted Winkler again, and asked him to be in the theatrical version he was staging, to which Winkler agreed. He was also excited to be working with Ritter again. Although their initial debut was not well-received, they were invited to perform the play in Washington, D.C. with a few casting changes, and it received positive reviews. The play then moved to Broadway, and again received positive reviews.

In September 2003, he was slated for a guest appearance on Ritter&#x27;s show, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;. However, during the filming of the episode, Ritter became ill and had to be taken to the hospital, dying hours later. The episode was never completed, and Winkler&#x27;s role was dropped.

=== 2003–2019: &quot;Arrested Development&quot; ===
In 2003, Mitch Hurwitz wanted Winkler to portray the incompetent lawyer Barry Zuckerkorn on one episode of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. However, as Winkler notes, he &quot;went for one episode and...stayed for five years&quot;. He also returned for the later seasons in 2013 and 2018. For his portrayal of Barry Zuckerkorn, Winkler won a Gold Derby Award: Comedy Guest Actor in 2004. In 2014, Winkler was nominated as part of the cast for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.

&quot;Arrested Development&quot; is known for its &quot;inside jokes&quot;. In three episodes of the 2013 reboot, Winkler&#x27;s son Max portrayed &quot;young Barry Zuckerkorn&quot; in flashbacks. In addition, there were a number of references to &quot;Happy Days&quot;, such as in the season three episode &quot;Forget-Me-Now&quot;, where Scott Baio joined the cast as the potentially new lawyer Bob Loblaw, stating, &quot;look, this is not the first time I&#x27;ve been brought in to replace Barry Zuckerkorn.&quot; &quot;Vulture&quot; argues that this statement is &quot;a nod to &quot;Happy Days&quot;, where [Baio] was brought on as Chachi, to be a new teen idol as Henry Winkler got older&quot;. In addition, Barry&#x27;s &quot;hopping&quot; over the shark on the pier in &quot;Motherboy XXX&quot; is a reference to Jon Hein&#x27;s phrase jumping the shark. Hein coined the phrase in 1985, in response to a 1977 &quot;Happy Days&quot; episode in which Fonzie jumps over a shark while on water skis.

=== 2003–2019: Hank Zipzer ===
Winkler&#x27;s career as an author began with the &quot;Hank Zipzer&quot; series of children&#x27;s books about the adventures of a dyslexic child, which he co-wrote with Lin Oliver. During the early 2000s, when Winkler experienced &quot;a lull in [his] acting career&quot;, his manager Alan Berger suggested that he write children&#x27;s books about the difficulties he experienced as a child before he knew that he was dyslexic. Winkler was resistant to the idea until Berger suggested that Winkler co-write the books with an experienced author.

Berger introduced Winkler to Oliver, and the two met for lunch and created the character of Hank Zipzer. Winkler chose the name Hank from the nickname for Henry, and Zipzer from the name of a neighbor in the apartment building that he grew up in. Winkler and Oliver&#x27;s writing process, which involved developing ideas during in-person discussions, drew upon their mutual background in television. According to Winkler, the system drew upon his strengths as an actor, allowing him to work through ideas out loud.

The original series spanned 17 books, published from 2003 to 2010. Following that, Winkler and Oliver wrote a prequel series, &quot;Here&#x27;s Hank&quot; (2014 to 2019), which explores Hank&#x27;s life as a second-grader before he was diagnosed as dyslexic. The &quot;Here&#x27;s Hank&quot; series uses a dyslexic-friendly font called Dyslexie, marking the first time that this font was used in a book published in the United States.

Winkler and Oliver also created the television adaptation &quot;Hank Zipzer&quot;, which ran for three seasons, from 2014 to 2016. The series appeared on the children&#x27;s BBC Channel, as they could not find an American buyer for it. After the series was successful on the BBC, it was broadcast on the Universal Kids Channel in the United States. Winkler played the music teacher Mr. Rock, who was based a teacher at McBurney who encouraged Winkler. They also produced the 2016 stand-alone television film &quot;Hank Zipzer&#x27;s Christmas Catastrophe&quot;.

===2004–present: Acting roles===

====Theater====
Winkler returned to the stage in 2006 as Captain Hook in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the New Wimbledon Theatre, London. He reprised the role in Woking for Christmas 2007. For the 2008/2009 season, he played Captain Hook at the Milton Keynes Theatre, and once again for the 2009/2010 panto season at the Liverpool Empire. A few years later in 2012, Winkler made his third Broadway appearance as &quot;Chuck Wood&quot; in &quot;The Performers&quot; (November 14–18).

====Television and film====

Winkler has continued his work as a character actor in television and film. In television, he was nominated in 2004 for a Daytime Emmy, Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program, and in 2005, he won the Daytime Emmy, Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program, for his voice-work as Norville in &quot;Clifford&#x27;s Puppy Days&quot;. Additional television roles include Dr. Stewart Barnes in &quot;Out of Practice&quot; (2005–2006), Eddie R. Lawson in &quot;Royal Pains&quot; (2010–2016), Sy Mittleman in &quot;Childrens Hospital &quot;(2010–2016), Dr. Saperstein in &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2013–2015), the villainous Uncle King Julien in animated series &quot;All Hail King Julien&quot; and its spinoff season &quot;Exiled&quot; (2014–2017), and Fritz in the 2021–present animated streaming television series &quot;Monsters at Work&quot;.

His film roles include Uncle Ralph in the Christmas film &quot;The Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot; (2008), Marty Streb in &quot;Here Comes the Boom&quot; (2012), Ed Koch in &quot;Donald Trump&#x27;s The Art of the Deal: The Movie&quot; (2016), Grandpa Bill in &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; (2017), Uncle Joe in Wes Anderson&#x27;s 2021 release &quot;The French Dispatch&quot;, and a cameo appearance as Al Pratt (Uncle Al) in the 2022 release &quot;Black Adam&quot;.

==== 2016–2018: &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot; ====
Winkler was both an executive producer for and star of the American reality-travel show, &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot;. He starred along with William Shatner, Terry Bradshaw, George Foreman, and Jeff Dye, in this adaptation of the South Korean reality series, &quot;Grandpas Over Flowers&quot;.

Winkler was the focus of the Season 2 episode &quot;Berlin: How Do You Say Roots in German?&quot; as the group explored the city from which his parents escaped in 1939. The journey culminated at the site of a brass memorial plaque, known as a stolperstein, embedded in the pavement in front of the workplace and home of his uncle, Helmut Winkler. The discovery came as a complete surprise to Winkler, as Jeff Dye had secretly enlisted the help of Winkler&#x27;s children, who planned the surprise.

==== 2018–2023: &quot;Barry&quot; ====
When Bill Hader developed the HBO comedy &quot;Barry&quot; with Alec Berg, he asked HBO if they could &quot;get&quot; Winkler for the part of acting teacher Gene Cousineau. According to Hader, he was &quot;out of [his] mind&quot; when HBO told him that Winkler was coming to audition for the role. In addition, Winkler&#x27;s son Max, who is a director, helped him to prepare for this audition.

Work for the first season of &quot;Barry&quot; began in 2016. Winkler has noted parallels between &quot;Barry&quot; and his time on &quot;Happy Days&quot;. He &quot;was 27 when I did the Fonz, and now, I&#x27;m 72. I just flipped the numbers.&quot; In his role as Cousineau, he wears Garry Marshall&#x27;s tie as &quot;a tribute to my mentor&quot;. Cousineau was originally written to be &quot;much darker, much colder—really cynical&quot;, but after Winkler added his own insight, the character became more affectionate. Portraying Cousineau allowed Winkler to draw upon decades of experience with acting teachers. Winkler continued his lifelong habit of improvising when he forgot his lines, something he has &quot;done my whole career—except I drove Bill mad&quot;.

Winkler received his first Primetime Emmy Award in 2018 for his portrayal of Gene Cousineau. He also won two Critics&#x27; Choice Television Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2019 and 2023. In addition, he received three Primetime Emmy nominations, three Golden Globe nominations, and four Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations for the role.

==Filmography and accolades==
Winkler states that during his lifetime, he has worked with &quot;five directing geniuses&quot;: Garry Marshall (&quot;Happy Days&quot;), Adam Sandler, Mitch Hurwitz (&quot;Arrested Development&quot;), Bill Hader and Alec Berg (&quot;Barry&quot;).

After portraying Fonzie on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, Winkler evolved into a character actor, with roles that include the high school principal Arthur Himbry in &quot;Scream&quot;, Coach Klein in &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, Barry Zuckerkorn in &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, Sy Mittleman in &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot;, Dr. Saperstein in &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, Mr. Rock in the &quot;Hank Zipzer&quot; BBC series, Eddie R. Lawson in &quot;Royal Pains&quot;, Fritz in &quot;Monsters at Work&quot;, Uncle Joe in &quot;The French Dispatch&quot;, Al Pratt in &quot;Black Adam&quot;, and Gene Cousineau in &quot;Barry&quot;. He is also the recipient of a Primetime Emmy, two Golden Globe Awards, two Critics Choice Awards, and two Daytime Emmys.

==Philanthropy==
In March 2020, Winkler contributed via Zoom to social justice issues during COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. On May 7, 2020, the Office of the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, posted a video of Winkler on Facebook and Twitter reminding Californians to practice social distancing and to follow stay-at-home orders.

During this time, Winkler also offered aid &quot;to SAG-AFTRA artists and their families&quot; through the virtual table read of Season 3, Episode 2 (&quot;The Motorcycle&quot;, 1975) of &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Winkler reprised the role of &quot;Fonzie&quot;, while SAG members Glenn Close, John Carroll Lynch, Eli Goree, Aldis Hodge, Jamie Chung, Luke Newton, and Nicola Coughlan read the roles of Marion Cunningham, Howard Cunningham, Richie Cunningham, Ralph Malph, Joanie Cunningham, Potsie, and a waitress at Al&#x27;s diner.

==Personal life==
Winkler met Stacey (formerly Weitzman (née Furstman) in a Beverly Hills clothing store in 1976 and they married in 1978 in the synagogue where he had his bar mitzvah. They have two children, including Max.

His cousin, the late actor and comedian Richard Belzer, starred as John Munch in the TV series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999–2013).

In 2018, almost 80 years after his parents had left Germany, Winkler visited Berlin for the television show &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot; and shared their story on the Season 2 episode &quot;Berlin: How Do You Say Roots in German?&quot;

Winkler continues to remain close with members of the &quot;Happy Days&quot; cast, telling the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; in November 2021 that &quot;I loved the people. They are still my friends.&quot;

=== Dyslexia ===

During his time on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, Winkler realized that he was dyslexic after his stepson was diagnosed with a learning disability. Previously, Winkler had known that aspects of reading and memorizing were difficult for him but not why. He had developed coping mechanisms that allowed him to mask the difficulties he had with cold-reading scripts. He later recalled that prior to learning about dyslexia, he frequently embarrassed himself in front of his fellow cast members as he would &quot;stumble at least once or twice a paragraph&quot;.

== Additional books and legacy ==
Winkler&#x27;s 2011 memoir &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Met an Idiot on the River&quot; explores his interest in fly fishing. The next year, he and his writing partner Lin Oliver created the &quot;Ghost Buddy&quot; book series (2012–2013), about the friendship between the protagonist Billy and a &quot;ghost buddy&quot;.

A few years later they wrote the science fiction trilogy &quot;Alien Superstar&quot; (2019–2021). The adventures of &quot;Alien Superstar&quot;″s protagonist are loosely based on Winker&#x27;s own experiences after arriving in Los Angeles.

Winkler released a new memoir, &quot;Being Henry: The Fonz...and Beyond&quot; in October 2023. He also began a new series of children&#x27;s books with Lin Oliver in 2023 called &quot;Detective Duck&quot;.

===The Fonz and &quot;Hank Zipzer&quot;===
&quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;The Fonz&quot; as No. 4 on its &quot;50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time&quot; list in 1999, and a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4 in the UK ranked him as 13th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. 

When asked which books influenced him in childhood, American journalist Anderson Cooper, who is dyslexic, responded that, &quot;I also loved the Fonz and read a book when I was around 8 called &quot;The Fonz: The Henry Winkler Story&quot;. I actually keep it in my office at CNN. Henry Winkler was very important to me when I was a child.&quot; This sentiment reflects National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution curator Eric Jentsch&#x27;s statement on the description of Fonzie&#x27;s leather jacket that Winkler donated to the Smithsonian in 1980: &quot;Fonzie was a representation of cool at a time when you were learning about what cool was.&quot;
Winkler won two Golden Globe Awards, and earned three Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for the role. In 1981, he received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (for Television), largely due to his portrayal of Fonzie. A few decades later, American artist Gerald P. Sawyer, unveiled the &quot;Bronze Fonz&quot; on the Milwaukee Riverwalk in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on August 18, 2008.

Winkler would eventually be recognized for contributing to a greater understanding of dyslexia through the &quot;Hank Zipzer&quot; series. He was given the Key to the City of Winnipeg for &quot;contributions to education and literacy&quot; in 2010, was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) &quot;for services to children with special educational needs and dyslexia in the UK&quot; by Queen Elizabeth in 2011, was named one of the &quot;United Kingdom&#x27;s Top 10 Literacy Heroes&quot; in 2013, and was awarded the Bill Rosendahl Public Service Award for Contributions to the Public Good for his children&#x27;s books in 2019 by the Los Angeles Press Club.

<doc id="406878" wikidata="Q12136088" url="?curid=406878" title="Operation Citadel">
<text>Operation Citadel () was the German offensive operation in July 1943 against Soviet forces in the Kursk salient, proposed by Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein during the Second World War on the Eastern Front that initiated the Battle of Kursk. The deliberate defensive operation that the Soviets implemented to repel the German offensive is referred to as the Kursk Strategic Defensive Operation. The German offensive was countered by two Soviet counter-offensives, Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev () and Operation Kutuzov (). For the Germans, the battle was the final strategic offensive that they were able to launch on the Eastern Front. As the Allied invasion of Sicily began, Adolf Hitler was forced to divert troops training in France to meet the Allied threats in the Mediterranean, rather than use them as a strategic reserve for the Eastern Front. Germany&#x27;s extensive loss of men and tanks during the operations ensured that the victorious Soviet Red Army enjoyed the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war.

The Germans hoped to weaken the Soviet offensive potential for the summer of 1943 by cutting off a large number of forces that they anticipated would be in the Kursk salient.
The Kursk salient or bulge was long from north to south and from east to west. The plan envisioned an envelopment by a pair of pincers breaking through the northern and southern flanks of the salient. Hitler believed that a victory here would reassert German strength and improve his prestige with his allies, who were considering withdrawing from the war. It was also hoped that large numbers of Soviet prisoners would be captured to be used as slave labour in the German armaments industry.

The Soviet government had foreknowledge of the German intentions, provided in part by the British intelligence services, the intelligence transmitted by the Lucy spy ring, and Tunny intercepts. Aware months in advance that the attack would fall on the neck of the Kursk salient, the Soviets built a defence in depth designed to wear down the German armoured spearhead. The Germans delayed the offensive while they tried to build up their forces and waited for new weapons, mainly the new Panther tank but also larger numbers of the Tiger heavy tank. This gave the Red Army time to construct a series of deep defensive belts. The defensive preparations included minefields, fortifications, artillery fire zones and anti-tank strong points, which extended approximately in depth. Soviet mobile formations were moved out of the salient and a large reserve force was formed for strategic counter-offensives.

== Background ==

After the conclusion of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.

Strategic discussions also occurred on the German side, with Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviet units to advance, while the German forces would launch a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition. But for political reasons, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler insisted that the German forces go on the offensive, choosing the Kursk salient for the attack. On 15 April 1943 the Führer authorized preparations for &quot;Unternehmen Zitadelle&quot; (Operation Citadel).

Operation Citadel called for a double envelopment, directed at Kursk, to surround the Soviet defenders of five armies and seal off the salient. Army Group Centre would provide General Walter Model&#x27;s 9th Army to form the northern pincer. It would cut through the northern face of the salient, driving south to the hills east of Kursk, securing the rail line from Soviet attack. Army Group South would commit the 4th Panzer Army, under Hermann Hoth, and Army Detachment &quot;Kempf&quot;, under Werner Kempf, to pierce the southern face of the salient. This force would drive north to meet the 9th Army east of Kursk. Von Manstein&#x27;s main attack was to be delivered by Hoth&#x27;s 4th Panzer Army, spearheaded by the II SS Panzer Corps under Paul Hausser. The XLVIII Panzer Corps, commanded by Otto von Knobelsdorff, would advance on the left while Army Detachment &quot;Kempf&quot; would advance on the right. The 2nd Army, under the command of Walter Weiss, would contain the western portion of the salient.

===Obstacles and postponements===
The German offensive, originally slated to commence in the beginning of May, was postponed several times as the German leadership reconsidered and vacillated over its prospects, as well as to bring forward more units and equipment.

As soon as Operations Order 6 was issued, which dictated that the operation should be ready to start on six days&#x27; notice after 28 April, the Ninth Army, which was to command the offensive in the Army Group Center zone, protested that its deployment could not be completed by 3 May. At a 3 May meeting, Hitler conferred with Manstein, Kluge, Zeitzler, Guderian, Speer, Chief of Staff OKL &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Hans Jeschonnek, and Commanding General, Ninth Army, &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Walter Model. There followed a discussion on the problems Model expected the Ninth Army to encounter in breaking through a &quot;well-fortified&quot; Soviet front and the inability of the Panzer IV tanks to stand up to the new Soviet antitank weapons. Hitler closed the meeting without giving a decision but indicated privately to Model that there would be a postponement. Manstein, Kluge, Zeitzler, Jeschonnek objected to the delay; Guderian and Speer objected to Citadel being executed at all because, even if successful, they argued, it would cause heavy tank losses and upset plans for an increase in armor strength for the German forces. Hitler decided to let Citadel wait until June, by which time he expected to have tanks of a newer model (Tiger 1) available in quantity. On 6 May, the OKH announced that Citadel was postponed to 12 June.

On 10 May, Guderian was summoned to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, for a discussion on the production of the Panther tank, and potential delays in its program. After the conference, Guderian asked for an audience with Hitler, in which Keitel, Guderian&#x27;s Chief of Staff Wolfgang Thomale, and Karl Saur of the Armaments Ministry were also present. There, as Guderian reports in his memoirs, he asked the Führer, &quot;Why do you want to attack in the East at all? How many people do you think even know where Kursk is? It is a matter of profound indifference to the world whether we hold Kursk or not. Why do we want to attack in the East at all this year?&quot; Hitler, according to Guderian, responded:

You&#x27;re quite right. Whenever I think of this attack my stomach turns over.

Hitler assured Guderian that there was as yet no commitment to the operation. However, at a May meeting of high Nazi Party officials, Hitler compared the current situation in the Eastern front to the predicament of the party in 1932, when it seemed to go down in political defeat at the hands of Franz von Papen and Hindenburg. He stated In 1932, we attained victory only by stubbornness that sometimes looked like madness; so, too, we will achieve it today.In the first weeks of June, the forces for Citadel were at their peak strength. On 18 June, the OKW Operations Staff submitted a proposal that Citadel be abandoned, and that all troops that could be spared should be deployed into strategic reserves for the defense of Italy and the Balkans, as well as Germany proper. On the same day, Hitler responded that he &quot;fully appreciated&quot; the General Staff&#x27;s view, but had decided to go ahead; two days later, he set the time for 5 July.

The Soviet leadership, through their intelligence agencies and foreign sources, had been informed about the German intentions, and therefore the multiple delays by the German high command, OKW, allowed them a great deal of time to prepare their defences. Employing defence in depth, they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking panzer formations. Three belts made up of extensive minefields, anti-tank ditches and anti-tank gun emplacements were created. Behind those were an additional three belts, which were mostly unoccupied and less fortified. The Voronezh Front, commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin, was tasked with defending the southern face of the salient. The Central Front, commanded by Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky, defended the northern face. Waiting in reserve was the Steppe Front, commanded by Ivan Konev. In February 1943, the Central Front had been reconstructed from the Don Front, which had been part of the northern pincer of Operation Uranus and had been responsible for the destruction of the 6th Army at Stalingrad.

=== Preliminary actions ===
Fighting started on the southern face of the salient on the evening of 4 July 1943, when German infantry launched attacks to seize high ground for artillery observation posts before the main assault. During these attacks a number of Red Army command and observation posts along the first main belt of defence were captured. By 16:00, elements of the Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Großdeutschland&quot;, 3rd and 11th Panzer Divisions had seized the village of Butovo and proceeded to capture Gertsovka before midnight. At around 22:30, Vatutin ordered 600 guns, mortars and Katyusha rocket launchers, of the Voronezh Front, to bombard the forward German positions, particularly those of the II SS Panzer Corps.

To the north, at Central Front headquarters, reports of the anticipated German offensive came in. At around 02:00 5 July, Zhukov ordered his preemptive artillery bombardment to begin. The hope was to disrupt German forces concentrating for the attack, but the outcome was less than hoped for. The bombardment delayed the German formations, but failed in the goal of disrupting their schedule or inflicting substantial losses. The Germans began their own artillery bombardment at about 05:00, which lasted 80 minutes in the northern face and 50 minutes in the southern face. After the barrage, the ground forces attacked, aided by close air support provided by the Luftwaffe.

In the early morning of 5 July, the VVS launched a large raid against German airfields, hoping to destroy the Luftwaffe on the ground. This effort failed, and the Red Army air units suffered considerable losses. The VVS lost 176 aircraft on 5 July, compared to the 26 aircraft lost by the Luftwaffe. The losses of the VVS 16th Air Army operating in the northern face were lighter than those suffered by the 2nd Air Army. The Luftwaffe was able to gain and maintained air superiority over the southern face until 10–11 July, when the VVS began to obtain ascendency but the control of the skies over the northern face was evenly contested until the VVS began to gain air superiority on 7 July, which it maintained for the rest of the operation.

== Operation along the northern face ==

Model&#x27;s main attack was delivered by XLVII Panzer Corps, supported by 45 Tigers of the attached 505th Heavy Tank Battalion. Covering their left flank was XLI Panzer Corps, with an attached regiment of 83 &quot;Ferdinand&quot; tank destroyers. On the right flank, XLVI Panzer Corps consisted at this time of four infantry divisions with just 9 tanks and 31 assault guns. To the left of XLI Panzer Corps was XXIII Army Corps, which consisted of the reinforced 78th Assault Infantry Division and two regular infantry divisions. While the corps contained no tanks, it did have 62 assault guns. Opposing the 9th Army was the Central Front, deployed in three heavily fortified defensive belts.

===Initial German advance===
Model chose to make his initial attacks using infantry divisions reinforced with assault guns and heavy tanks, and supported by artillery and the Luftwaffe. In doing so he sought to maintain the armoured strength of his panzer divisions to be used for exploitation once the Red Army defences were breached. Once a breakthrough had been achieved the panzer forces would move through and advance towards Kursk. Jan Möschen, a major in Model&#x27;s staff, later commented that Model expected a breakthrough on the second day. If a breakthrough was achieved, the briefest delay in bringing up the panzer divisions would give the Red Army time to react. His corps commanders, however, thought a breakthrough extremely unlikely.

Following a preliminary bombardment and Red Army counter bombardments, the 9th Army opened its attack at 05:30 on 5 July. Nine infantry divisions and one panzer division, with attached assault guns, heavy tanks, and tank destroyers, pushed forward. Two companies of Tiger tanks were attached to the 6th Infantry Division, and were the largest single grouping of Tigers employed that day. Opposing them were the 13th and 70th Armies of the Central Front.

The 20th Panzer and 6th Infantry Divisions of the XLVII Panzer Corps, spearheaded the advance of the XLVII Panzer Corps. Behind them the remaining two panzer divisions followed, ready to exploit any breakthrough. The heavily mined terrain and fortified positions of the 15th Rifle Division slowed the advance. By 08:00 safe lanes had been cleared through the minefield. That morning information obtained from prisoner interrogation identified a weakness at the boundary of the 15th and 81st Rifle Divisions caused by the German preliminary bombardment. The Tigers were redeployed and struck towards this area. Red Army formations countered with a force of around 90 T-34s. In the resulting three-hour battle, Red Army armoured units lost 42 tanks while the Germans lost two Tigers and a further five more immobilized with track damage. While the Red Army counterattack was defeated and the first defensive belt breached, the fighting had delayed the Germans long enough for the rest of 29th Rifle Corps of the 13th Army – initially deployed behind the first belt – to move forward and seal the breach. Red Army minefields were covered by artillery fire, making efforts to clear paths through the fields difficult and costly. Goliath and Borgward IV remote-controlled engineer mine-clearing vehicles met with limited success. Of the 653rd Heavy Panzerjäger Battalion&#x27;s 45 Ferdinands sent into battle, all but 12 of them were immobilized by mine damage before 17:00. Most of these were later repaired and returned to service, but the recovery of these very large vehicles was difficult.

On the first day, the XLVII Panzer Corps penetrated into the Red Army defences before stalling, and the XLI Panzer Corps reached the heavily fortified small town of Ponyri, in the second defensive belt, which controlled the roads and railways leading south to Kursk. In the first day, the Germans penetrated into the Red Army lines for the loss of 1,287 men killed and missing and a further 5,921 wounded.

===Red Army counterattack===
Rokossovsky ordered the 17th Guards and 18th Guards Rifle Corps with the 2nd Tank Army and 19th Tank Corps, backed up by close air support, to counterattack the German 9th Army the following day on 6 July. However, due to poor coordination, only the 16th Tank Corps of the 2nd Tank Army commenced the counterattack on the dawn of 6 July after the preparatory artillery barrage. The 16th Tank Corps, fielding about 200 tanks, attacked the XLVII Panzer Corps and ran into the Tiger tanks of the 505th Heavy Tank Battalion, which knocked out 69 tanks and forced the rest to withdraw to the 17th Guards Rifle Corps of the 13th Army. Later that morning, the XLVII Panzer Corps responded with its own attack against the 17th Guards Rifle Corps entrenched around the village Olkhovatka in the second defensive belt. The attack commenced with an artillery barrage and was spearheaded by the 24 serviceable Tigers of the 505th Heavy Tank Battalion, but it failed to break the Red Army defence at Olkhovatka, and the Germans suffered heavy casualties. Olkhovatka was on a high ground that provided a clear view of much of the frontline. At 18:30, the 19th Tank Corps joined the 17th Guards Rifle Corps further bolstering resistance. Rokossovsky also decided to dig in most of his remaining tanks to minimize their exposure. Ponyri, defended by the 307th Rifle Division of the 29th Rifle Corps, was also concertedly attacked on 6 July by the German 292nd and 86th Infantry, 78th Assault Infantry and 9th Panzer Divisions, but the Germans were unable to dislodge the defenders from the heavily fortified village.

===Ponyri and Olkhovatka===
Over the next three days from 7 to 10 July, Model concentrated the effort of the 9th Army at Ponyri and Olkhovatka, which both sides considered as vital positions. In response, Rokossovsky pulled forces from other parts of the front to these sectors. The Germans attacked Ponyri on 7 July, and captured half of the town after intense house-to-house fighting. A Soviet counterattack the following morning forced the Germans to withdraw, and a series of counterattacks ensued by both sides with control of the town being exchanged several times over the next few days. By 10 July, the Germans had secured most of the town, but Soviet counterattacks continued. The back and forth battles for Ponyri and the nearby Hill 253.5 were battles of attrition, with heavy casualties on both sides. It became referred to by the troops as &quot;mini-Stalingrad&quot;. The war diary of the 9th Army described the heavy fighting as a &quot;new type of mobile attrition battle&quot;. German attacks on Olkhovatka and the nearby village of Teploe failed to penetrate the Soviet defences; including a powerful concerted attack on 10 July by about 300 Germans tanks and assault guns from the 2nd, 4th, and 20th Panzer Divisions, supported by all available Luftwaffe air power in the northern face.

On 9 July a meeting between Kluge, Model, Joachim Lemelsen and Josef Harpe was held at the headquarters of the XLVII Panzer Corps. It had become clear to the German commanders that the 9th Army lacked the strength to obtain a breakthrough, and their Soviet counterparts had also realized this, but Kluge wished to maintain the pressure on the Soviets in order to aid the southern offensive.

While the operation on the northern side of the salient began with a attack front, by 6 July it had been reduced to . The following day the attack frontage dropped to , and on both the 8 and 9 July penetrations of only occurred. By 10 July, the Soviets had completely halted the German advance.

On 12 July the Soviets launched Operation Kutuzov, their counter-offensive upon the Orel salient, which threatened the flank and rear of Model&#x27;s 9th Army. The 12th Panzer Division, thus far held in reserve and slated to be committed to the northern side of the Kursk salient, along with the 36th Motorized Infantry, 18th Panzer and 20th Panzer Divisions were redeployed to face the Soviet spearheads.

== Operation along the southern face ==
At around 04:00 on 5 July, the German attack commenced with a preliminary bombardment. Manstein&#x27;s main attack was delivered by Hoth&#x27;s 4th Panzer Army, which was organized into densely concentrated spearheads. Opposing the 4th Panzer Army was the Soviet 6th Guards Army, which was composed of the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 23rd Guards Rifle Corps. The Soviets had constructed three heavily fortified defensive belts to slow and weaken the attacking armoured forces. Though they had been provided superb intelligence, the Voronezh Front headquarters had still not been able to pinpoint the exact location where the Germans would place their offensive weight.

===Initial German advance===

==== XLVIII Panzer Corps ====

The panzergrenadier division &quot;Großdeutschland&quot;, commanded by Walter Hörnlein, was the strongest single division in the 4th Panzer Army. It was supported on its flanks by the 3rd and 11th Panzer Divisions. &quot;Großdeutschland&#x27;s&quot; Panzer IIIs and IVs had been supplemented by a company of 15 Tigers, which were used to spearhead the attack. At dawn on 5 July, &quot;Großdeutschland&quot;, backed by heavy artillery support, advanced on a three-kilometre front upon the 67th Guards Rifle Division of the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps. The Panzerfüsilier Regiment, advancing on the left wing, stalled in a minefield and subsequently 36 Panthers were immobilized. The stranded regiment was subjected to a barrage of Soviet anti-tank and artillery fire, which inflicted numerous casualties. Engineers were moved up and cleared paths through the minefield, but suffered casualties in the process. The combination of fierce resistance, minefields, thick mud and mechanical breakdowns took its toll. With paths cleared, the regiment resumed its advance towards Gertsovka. In the ensuing battle, heavy casualties were sustained including the regimental commander Colonel Kassnitz. Due to the fighting, and the marshy terrain south of the village, surrounding the Berezovyy stream, the regiment once more bogged down.

The panzergrenadier regiment of &quot;Großdeutschland&quot;, advancing on the right wing, pushed through to the village of Butovo. The tanks were deployed in an arrow formation to minimise the effects of the Soviet Pakfront defence, with the Tigers leading and the Panzer IIIs, IVs and assault guns fanning out to the flanks and rear. They were followed by infantry and combat engineers. Attempts by the VVS to impede the advance were repulsed by the Luftwaffe.

The 3rd Panzer Division, advancing on the left flank of &quot;Großdeutschland&quot;, made good progress and by the end of the day had captured Gertsovka and reached Mikhailovka. The 167th Infantry Division, on the right flank of the 11th Panzer Division, also made sufficient progress, reaching Tirechnoe by the end of the day. By the end of 5 July, a wedge had been created in the first belt of the Soviet defences.

==== II SS Panzer Corps ====

To the east, during the night of 4–5 July, SS combat engineers had infiltrated no-man&#x27;s land and cleared lanes through the Soviet minefields. At dawn, 5 July, the three divisions of II SS Panzer Corps – SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler&quot;, 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Das Reich&quot; and the 3rd SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot; – attacked the 6th Guards Army&#x27;s 52nd Guards Rifle Division. The main assault was led by a spearhead of 42 Tigers, but in total 494 tanks and assault guns attacked across a twelve-kilometre front. &quot;Totenkopf&quot;, the strongest of the three divisions, advanced towards Gremuchhi and screened the right flank. The 1st SS Panzergrenadier Division advanced on the left flank towards Bykovka. The 2nd SS Panzer Division advanced between the two formations in the center. Following closely behind the tanks were the infantry and combat engineers, coming forward to demolish obstacles and clear trenches. In addition, the advance was well supported by the Luftwaffe, which greatly aided in breaking Soviet strong points and artillery positions.

By 09:00 hours, the II SS Panzer Corps had broken through the Soviet first belt of defence along its entire front. While probing positions between the first and second Soviet defensive belts, at 13:00, the 2nd SS Panzer Division&#x27;s vanguard came under fire from two T-34 tanks, which were destroyed. Forty more Soviet tanks soon engaged the division. The 1st Guards Tank Army clashed with the 2nd SS Panzer Division in a four-hour battle, resulting in the Soviet tanks withdrawing. However, the battle had bought enough time for units of the 23rd Soviet Guards Rifle Corps, lodged in the Soviet second belt, to prepare itself and be reinforced with additional anti-tank guns. By the early evening, 2nd SS Panzer Division had reached the minefields that marked the outer perimeter of the Soviet second belt of defence. The 1st SS Division had secured Bykovka by 16:10. It then pushed forward towards the second belt of defence at Yakovlevo, but its attempts to break through were rebuffed. By the end of the day, the 1st SS Division had sustained 97 dead, 522 wounded, and 17 missing and lost about 30 tanks. Together with the 2nd SS Panzer Division, it had forced a wedge far into the defences of the 6th Guards Army.

The 3rd SS Panzer Division was making slow progress. They had managed to isolate the 155th Guards Regiment, of the 52nd Guards Rifle Division (of the 23rd Guards Rifle Corps), from the rest of its parent division, but its attempts to sweep the regiment eastward into the flank of the neighbouring 375th Rifle Division (of the 23rd Guards Rifle Corps) had failed when the regiment was reinforced by the 96th Tank Brigade. Hausser, the commander of II SS Panzer Corps, requested aid from the III Panzer Corps to his right, but the panzer corps had no units to spare. By the end of the day, the 3rd SS Division had made very limited progress due in part to a tributary of the Donets river. The lack of progress undermined the advance made by its sister divisions and exposed the right flank of the corps to Soviet forces. The temperatures, reaching over 30 degrees Celsius, and frequent thunderstorms made fighting conditions difficult.

The 6th Guards Army, which confronted the attack by the &quot;XLVIII Panzer Korps&quot; and &quot;II SS Panzer Korps&quot;, was reinforced with tanks from the 1st Tank Army, the 2nd Guards Tank Corps and the 5th Guards Tank Corps. The 51st and 90th Guards Rifle divisions were moved up to the vicinity of Pokrovka (not Prokhorovka, site of one of future confrontations, to the north-east), in the path of the 1st SS Panzer Division. The 93rd Guards Rifle Division was deployed further back, along the road leading from Pokrovka to Prokhorovka.

==== Army Detachment &quot;Kempf&quot; ====

Facing Army Detachment &quot;Kempf&quot;, consisting of III Panzer Corps and &quot;Corps Raus&quot; (commanded by Erhard Raus), were the 7th Guards Army, dug in on the high ground on the eastern bank of the Northern Donets. The two German corps were tasked with crossing the river, breaking through the 7th Guards Army and covering the right flank of the 4th Panzer Army. The 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion, equipped with 45 Tigers, was also attached to the III Panzer Corps, with one company of 15 Tigers attached to each of the corps&#x27; three panzer divisions.

At the Milkhailovka bridgehead, just south of Belgorod, eight infantry battalions of the 6th Panzer Division crossed the river under heavy Soviet bombardment. Part of a company of Tigers from the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion was able to cross before the bridge was destroyed. The rest of the 6th Panzer Division was unable to cross further south due to a traffic jam at the crossing, and remained on the western bank of the river throughout the day. Those units of the division that had crossed the river attacked Stary Gorod, but were unable to break through due to poorly cleared minefields and strong resistance.

To the south of the 6th Panzer Division, the 19th Panzer Division crossed the river but was delayed by mines, moving forward by the end of the day. Luftwaffe bombed the bridgehead in a friendly fire incident, wounding 6th Panzer Division commander Walther von Hünersdorff and Hermann von Oppeln-Bronikowski of the 19th Panzer Division. Further south, infantry and tanks of 7th Panzer Division crossed the river. A new bridge had to be built specifically for the Tigers, causing further delays. Despite a poor start, the 7th Panzer Division eventually broke into the first belt of the Soviet defence and pushed on between Razumnoe and Krutoi Log, advancing , the furthest &quot;Kempf&quot; got during the day.
Operating to the south of 7th Panzer Division, were the 106th Infantry Division and the 320th Infantry Division of Corps &quot;Raus&quot;. The two formations attacked across a front without armour support. The advance began well, with the crossing of the river and a swift advance against the 72nd Guards Rifle Division. &quot;Corps Raus&quot; took the village of Maslovo Pristani, penetrating the first Red Army defence line. A Soviet counterattack supported by about 40 tanks was beaten off, with the assistance from artillery and flak batteries. After having suffered 2,000 casualties since the morning and still facing considerable resistance from the Soviet forces, the corps dug in for the night.

Delaying the progress of &quot;Kempf&quot; allowed Red Army forces time to prepare their second belt of defence to meet the German attack on 6 July. The 7th Guards Army, which had absorbed the attack of III Panzer Corps and &quot;Corps Raus&quot;, was reinforced with two rifle divisions from the reserve. The 15th Guards Rifle Division was moved up to the second belt of defence, in the path of the III Panzer Corps.

=== Development of the battle ===

By the evening of 6 July, the Voronezh Front had committed all of its reserves, except for three rifle divisions under the 69th Army; yet it could not decisively contain the 4th Panzer Army. The XLVIII Panzer Corps along the Oboyan axis, where the third defensive belt was mostly unoccupied, now had only the Red Army second defensive belt blocking it from breakthrough into the unfortified Soviet rear. This forced the Stavka to commit their strategic reserves to reinforce the Voronezh Front: the 5th Guards and 5th Guards Tank Armies, both from the Steppe Front, as well as the 2nd Tank Corps from the Southwestern Front. Ivan Konev objected to this premature piecemeal commitment of the strategic reserve, but a personal call from Stalin silenced his complaints. In addition, on 7 July Zhukov ordered the 17th Air Army – the air fleet serving the Southwestern Front – to support the 2nd Air Army in serving the Voronezh Front. On July 7, the 5th Guards Tank Army began advancing to Prokhorovka. 5th Guards Tank Army commander, Lieutenant General Pavel Rotmistrov, described the journey:

The 10th Tank Corps, then still subordinate to the 5th Guards Army, was rushed ahead of the rest of the army, arriving at Prokhorovka on the night of 7 July, and 2nd Tank Corps arrived at Korocha, southeast of Prokhorovka, by morning of 8 July. Vatutin ordered a powerful counterattack by the 5th Guards, 2nd Guards, 2nd and 10th Tank Corps, in all fielding about 593 tanks and self-propelled guns and supported by most of the Front&#x27;s available air power, which aimed to defeat the II SS Panzer Corps and therefore expose the right flank of XLVIII Panzer Corps. Simultaneously, the 6th Tank Corps was to attack the XLVIII Panzer Corps and prevent it from breaking through to the free Soviet rear. Although intended to be concerted, the counterattack turned out to be a series of piecemeal attacks due to poor coordination. The 10th Tank Corps&#x27; attack began on the dawn of 8 July but they ran straight into the antitank fire of the 2nd and 3rd SS Divisions, losing most of its forces. Later that morning, the 5th Guards Tank Corps&#x27; attack was repelled by the 3rd SS Division. The 2nd Tank Corps joined in the afternoon and was also repelled. The 2nd Guards Tank Corps, masked by the forest around the village Gostishchevo, north of Belgorod, with its presence unknown to the II SS Panzer Corps, advanced towards the 167th Infantry Division. But it was detected by German air reconnaissance just before the attack had materialized, and was subsequently decimated by German ground-attack aircraft armed with MK 103 anti-tank cannons and at least 50 tanks were destroyed. This marked the first time in military history an attacking tank formation had been defeated by air power alone. Although a fiasco, the Soviet counterattack succeeded in stalling the advance of the II SS Panzer Corps throughout the day.

By the end of 8 July, II SS-Panzer Corps had advanced about since the start of Citadel and broken through the first and second defensive belts. However, slow progress by the XLVIII Panzer Corps caused Hoth to shift elements of the II SS-Panzer Corps to the west to help the XLVIII Panzer Corps regain its momentum. On 10 July the full effort of the corps was shifted back to its own forward progress. The direction of their advance now shifted from Oboyan due north to the northeast, toward Prokhorovka. Hoth had discussed this move with Manstein since early May, and it was a part of the 4th Panzer Army&#x27;s plan since the outset of the offensive. By this time, however, the Soviets had shifted reserve formations into its path. The defensive positions were manned by the 2nd Tank Corps, reinforced by the 9th Guards Airborne Division and 301st Anti-tank Artillery Regiment, both from the 33rd Guards Rifle Corps.

Though the German advance in the south was slower than planned, it was faster than the Soviets expected. On 9 July, the first German units reached the Psel River. The next day, the first German infantry crossed the river. Despite the deep defensive system and minefields, German tank losses remained lower than the Soviet&#x27;s. At this point, Hoth turned the II SS Panzer Corps away from Oboyan to attack toward the northeast in the direction of Prokhorovka. The main concern of Manstein and Hausser was the inability of Army Detachment &quot;Kempf&quot; to advance and protect the eastern flank of the II SS Panzer Corps. On 11 July, Army Detachment &quot;Kempf&quot; finally achieved a breakthrough. In a surprise night attack, the 6th Panzer Division seized a bridge across the Donets. Once across, Breith made every effort to push troops and vehicles across the river for an advance on Prokhorovka from the south. A linkup with the II SS Panzer Corps would result with the Soviet 69th Army becoming encircled.

=== Battle of Prokhorovka ===
Throughout 10 and 11 July, the II-SS Panzer Corps continued its attack toward Prokhorovka, reaching within of the settlement by the night of 11 July. That same night, Hausser issued orders for the attack to continue the next day. The plan was for the 3rd SS Panzer Division to drive northeast until it reached the Karteschewka-Prokhorovka road. Once there, they were to strike southeast to attack the Soviet positions at Prokhorovka from the flanks and rear. The 1st and 2nd SS Panzer divisions were to wait until 3rd SS Panzer Division attack had destabilised the Soviet positions at Prokhorovka; and once underway, the 1st SS Panzer Division was to attack the main Soviet defences dug in on the slopes southwest of Prokhorovka. To the division&#x27;s right, the 2nd SS Panzer Division was to advance eastward, then turn southward away from Prokhorovka to roll up the Soviet lines opposing the III Panzer Corps&#x27; advance and force a gap. During the night of 11 July, Rotmistrov moved his 5th Guards Tank Army to an assembly area just behind Prokhorovka in preparation for a massive attack the following day. At 5:45 Leibstandarte headquarters started receiving reports of the ominous sound of tank engines as the Soviets moved into their assembly areas. Soviet artillery and Katyusha regiments were redeployed in preparation for the counterattack.
At around 08:00, a Soviet artillery barrage began. At 08:30, Rotmistrov radioed his tankers: &quot;Steel, Steel, Steel!&quot;, the order to commence the attack. Down off the west slopes, before Prokhorovka, came the massed armour of five tank brigades from the Soviet 18th and 29th Tank Corps of the 5th Guards Tank Army. The Soviet tanks advanced down the corridor, carrying mounted infantrymen of the 9th Guards Airborne Division on the tanks. To the north and east, the 3rd SS Panzer Division was engaged by the Soviet 33rd Guards Rifle Corps. Tasked with flanking the Soviet defences around Prokhorovka, the unit first had to beat off a number of attacks before they could go over onto the offensive. Most of the division&#x27;s tank losses occurred late in the afternoon as they advanced through mine fields against well-hidden Soviet anti-tank guns.

Although the 3rd SS succeeded in reaching the Karteschewka-Prokhorovka road, their hold was tenuous and it cost the division half of its armour. The majority of German tank losses suffered at Prokhorovka occurred here. To the south, the Soviet 18th and 29th Tank Corps had been thrown back by the 1st SS Panzer Division. The 2nd SS Panzer Division also repelled attacks from the 2nd Tank Corps and the 2nd Guards Tank Corps. Luftwaffe local air superiority over the battlefield also contributed to the Soviet losses, partly due to the VVS (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily – the Soviet Air Force) being directed against the German units on the flanks of II SS Panzer Corps. By the end of the day, the Soviets had fallen back to their starting positions.

Neither the 5th Guards Tank Army nor the II SS Panzer Corps accomplished their objectives. Though the Soviet counterattack failed with heavy losses, and were thrown back onto the defensive, yet they did enough to stop a German breakthrough.

== Termination of Operation Citadel ==

On the evening of 12 July, Hitler summoned Kluge and Manstein to his headquarters at Rastenburg in East Prussia. Two days earlier, the Western Allies had invaded Sicily. The threat of further Allied landings in Italy or along southern France made Hitler believe it was essential to move forces from Kursk to Italy and to discontinue the offensive. Kluge welcomed the news, as he was aware that the Soviets were initiating a massive offensive against his sector, but Manstein was less welcoming. Manstein&#x27;s forces had just spent a week fighting through a maze of defensive works and he believed they were on the verge of breaking through to more open terrain, which would allow him to engage and destroy the Soviet armoured reserves in a mobile battle. Manstein stated, &quot;On no account should we let go of the enemy until the mobile reserves he [has] committed [are] completely beaten.&quot; Hitler agreed to temporarily allow the continuance of the offensive in the southern part of the salient, but the following day he ordered Manstein&#x27;s reserve – the XXIV Panzer Corps – to move south to support the 1st Panzer Army. This removed the force Manstein believed was needed to succeed.

The offensive continued in the southern part with the launch of Operation Roland on 14 July. But after three days, on 17 July, the II SS Panzer Corps was ordered to end its offensive operations and begin withdrawing. This marked the end of Operation Roland. One of the panzer corps&#x27; divisions was transferred to Italy and the other two were sent south to meet new Soviet offensives. The strength of the Soviet reserve formations had been greatly underestimated by German intelligence, and the Red Army soon went onto the offensive. In his post-war memoirs &quot;Lost Victories&quot;, Manstein was highly critical of Hitler&#x27;s decision to call off the operation at the height of the tactical battle. The veracity of Manstein&#x27;s claims of a near victory is debatable. The extent of Soviet reserves was far greater than he realised. These reserves were used to re-equip the mauled 5th Guards Tank Army, which launched Operation Rumyantsev a couple of weeks later. The result was a battle of attrition for which the Germans were ill-prepared and which they had little chance of winning.

During Operation Citadel, Luftwaffe units in the area made 27,221 flying sorties with 193 combat losses (0.709% loss rate per sortie). Soviet units from 5 July to 8 July made 11,235 flying sorties with combat losses of 556 aircraft (4.95% per sortie). From a tactical perspective this might have been viewed as a success for the Germans, as they were surely destroying Soviet armor and aircraft with a better kill ratio of 1:6. The problem was that then the Germans were lacking strategic reserves when Western air power began viciously devastating the Luftwaffe and penetrating into Italy. By the fall of 1943 just 25% of Luftwaffe day fighters were in the Eastern Front, ending any hopes of German air superiority in the east.

<text>An odds ratio (OR) is a statistic that quantifies the strength of the association between two events, A and B. The odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the odds of event A taking place in the presence of B, and the odds of A in the absence of B. Due to symmetry, odds ratio reciprocally calculates the ratio of the odds of B occurring in the presence of A, and the odds of B in the absence of A. Two events are independent if and only if the OR equals 1, i.e., the odds of one event are the same in either the presence or absence of the other event. If the OR is greater than 1, then A and B are associated (correlated) in the sense that, compared to the absence of B, the presence of B raises the odds of A, and symmetrically the presence of A raises the odds of B. Conversely, if the OR is less than 1, then A and B are negatively correlated, and the presence of one event reduces the odds of the other event occurring.

Note that the odds ratio is symmetric in the two events, and no causal direction is implied (correlation does not imply causation): an OR greater than 1 does not establish that B causes A, or that A causes B.

Two similar statistics that are often used to quantify associations are the relative risk (RR) and the absolute risk reduction (ARR). Often, the parameter of greatest interest is actually the RR, which is the ratio of the probabilities analogous to the odds used in the OR. However, available data frequently do not allow for the computation of the RR or the ARR, but do allow for the computation of the OR, as in case-control studies, as explained below. On the other hand, if one of the properties (A or B) is sufficiently rare (in epidemiology this is called the rare disease assumption), then the OR is approximately equal to the corresponding RR.

The OR plays an important role in the logistic model.

==Definition and basic properties==

=== Intuition from an example for laypeople ===

If we flip an unbiased coin, the probability of getting heads and the probability of getting tails are equal — both are 50%. Imagine we get a biased coin that makes it two times more likely to get heads. But what does &quot;twice as likely&quot; mean in terms of a probability? It cannot literally mean to double the original probability value, because doubling 50% would yield 100%. Rather, it is the &quot;odds&quot; that are doubling: from 1:1 odds, to 2:1 odds. The new probabilities would be 66⅔% for heads and 33⅓% for tails.

===A motivating example, in the context of the rare disease assumption===

Suppose a radiation leak in a village of 1,000 people increased the incidence of a rare disease. The total number of people exposed to the radiation was formula_1 out of which formula_2 developed the disease and formula_3 stayed healthy. The total number of people not exposed was formula_4 out of which formula_5 developed the disease and formula_6 stayed healthy. We can organize this in a contingency table:

:formula_7

The &quot;risk&quot; of developing the disease given exposure is formula_8 and of developing the disease given non-exposure is formula_9. One obvious way to compare the risks is to use the ratio of the two, the &quot;relative risk&quot;.

:formula_10

The odds ratio is different. The &quot;odds&quot; of getting the disease if exposed is formula_11 and the odds if &quot;not&quot; exposed is formula_12 The &quot;odds ratio&quot; is the ratio of the two,

:formula_13
As illustrated by this example, in a rare-disease case like this, the relative risk and the odds ratio are almost the same. By definition, rare disease implies that formula_14 and formula_15. Thus, the denominators in the relative risk and odds ratio are almost the same (formula_16 and formula_17.

Relative risk is easier to understand than the odds ratio, but one reason to use odds ratio is that usually, data on the entire population is not available and random sampling must be used. In the example above, if it were very costly to interview villagers and find out if they were exposed to the radiation, then the prevalence of radiation exposure would not be known, and neither would the values of formula_18 or formula_19. One could take a random sample of fifty villagers, but quite possibly such a random sample would not include anybody with the disease, since only 2.6% of the population are diseased. Instead, one might use a case-control study in which all 26 diseased villagers are interviewed as well as a random sample of 26 who do not have the disease. The results might turn out as follows (&quot;might&quot;, because this is a random sample):

:formula_20

The odds in this sample of getting the disease given that someone is exposed is 20/10 and the odds given that someone is not exposed is 6/16. The odds ratio is thus formula_21, quite close to the odds ratio calculated for the entire village. The relative risk, however, cannot be calculated, because it is the ratio of the risks of getting the disease and we would need formula_22 and formula_19 to figure those out. Because the study selected for people with the disease, half the people in the sample have the disease and it is known that that is more than the population-wide prevalence.

It is standard in the medical literature to calculate the odds ratio and then use the rare-disease assumption (which is usually reasonable) to claim that the relative risk is approximately equal to it. This not only allows for the use of case-control studies, but makes controlling for confounding variables such as weight or age using regression analysis easier and has the desirable properties discussed in other sections of this article of invariance and insensitivity to the type of sampling.

===Definition in terms of group-wise odds===

The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it occurring in another group. The term is also used to refer to sample-based estimates of this ratio. These groups might be men and women, an experimental group and a control group, or any other dichotomous classification. If the probabilities of the event in each of the groups are &quot;p&quot;1 (first group) and &quot;p&quot;2 (second group), then the odds ratio is:

:formula_24

where &quot;q&quot;x = 1 − &quot;p&quot;&quot;x&quot;. An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the condition or event under study is equally likely to occur in both groups. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that the condition or event is more likely to occur in the first group. And an odds ratio less than 1 indicates that the condition or event is less likely to occur in the first group. The odds ratio must be nonnegative if it is defined. It is undefined if &quot;p&quot;2&quot;q&quot;1 equals zero, i.e., if &quot;p&quot;2 equals zero or &quot;q&quot;1 equals zero.

===Definition in terms of joint and conditional probabilities===

The odds ratio can also be defined in terms of the joint probability distribution of two binary random variables. The joint distribution of binary random variables and can be written

:formula_25

where 11, 10, 01 and 00 are non-negative &quot;cell probabilities&quot; that sum to one. The odds for within the two subpopulations defined by = 1 and = 0 are defined in terms of the conditional probabilities given , &quot;i.e.&quot;, :

:formula_26

Thus the odds ratio is

:formula_27

The simple expression on the right, above, is easy to remember as the product of the probabilities of the &quot;concordant cells&quot; divided by the product of the probabilities of the &quot;discordant cells&quot; . However in some applications the labeling of categories as zero and one is arbitrary, so there is nothing special about concordant versus discordant values in these applications.

===Symmetry===

If we had calculated the odds ratio based on the conditional probabilities given &quot;Y&quot;,

:formula_28

we would have obtained the same result

:formula_29

Other measures of effect size for binary data such as the relative risk do not have this symmetry property.

===Relation to statistical independence===

If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are independent, their joint probabilities can be expressed in terms of their marginal probabilities and , as follows

:formula_30

In this case, the odds ratio equals one, and conversely the odds ratio can only equal one if the joint probabilities can be factored in this way. Thus the odds ratio equals one if and only if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are independent.

===Recovering the cell probabilities from the odds ratio and marginal probabilities===

The odds ratio is a function of the cell probabilities, and conversely, the cell probabilities can be recovered given knowledge of the odds ratio and the marginal probabilities and . If the odds ratio &quot;R&quot; differs from 1, then

:formula_31

where , and

:formula_32

In the case where , we have independence, so .

Once we have , the other three cell probabilities can easily be recovered from the marginal probabilities.

==Example==
Suppose that in a sample of 100 men, 90 drank wine in the previous week (so 10 did not), while in a sample of 80 women only 20 drank wine in the same period (so 60 did not). This forms the contingency table:

:formula_33

The odds ratio (OR) can be directly calculated from this table as:

:formula_34

Alternatively, the odds of a man drinking wine are 90 to 10, or 9:1, while the odds of a woman drinking wine are only 20 to 60, or 1:3 = 0.33. The odds ratio is thus 9/0.33, or 27, showing that men are much more likely to drink wine than women. The detailed calculation is:

:formula_35

This example also shows how odds ratios are sometimes sensitive in stating relative positions: in this sample men are (90/100)/(20/80) = 3.6 times as likely to have drunk wine than women, but have 27 times the odds. The logarithm of the odds ratio, the difference of the logits of the probabilities, tempers this effect, and also makes the measure symmetric with respect to the ordering of groups. For example, using natural logarithms, an odds ratio of 27/1 maps to 3.296, and an odds ratio of 1/27 maps to −3.296.

==Statistical inference==
Several approaches to statistical inference for odds ratios have been developed.

One approach to inference uses large sample approximations to the sampling distribution of the log odds ratio (the natural logarithm of the odds ratio). If we use the joint probability notation defined above, the population log odds ratio is

:formula_36

If we observe data in the form of a contingency table
:formula_37

then the probabilities in the joint distribution can be estimated as

:formula_38

where , with being the sum of all four cell counts. The sample log odds ratio is

:formula_39.

The distribution of the log odds ratio is approximately normal with:

: formula_40

The standard error for the log odds ratio is approximately

:formula_41.

This is an asymptotic approximation, and will not give a meaningful result if any of the cell counts are very small. If &quot;L&quot; is the sample log odds ratio, an approximate 95% confidence interval for the population log odds ratio is . This can be mapped to to obtain a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio. If we wish to test the hypothesis that the population odds ratio equals one, the two-sided p-value is , where &quot;P&quot; denotes a probability, and &quot;Z&quot; denotes a standard normal random variable.

An alternative approach to inference for odds ratios looks at the distribution of the data conditionally on the marginal frequencies of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. An advantage of this approach is that the sampling distribution of the odds ratio can be expressed exactly.

==Role in logistic regression==

Logistic regression is one way to generalize the odds ratio beyond two binary variables. Suppose we have a binary response variable &quot;Y&quot; and a binary predictor variable &quot;X&quot;, and in addition we have other predictor variables &quot;Z&quot;1, ..., &quot;Zp&quot; that may or may not be binary. If we use multiple logistic regression to regress &quot;Y&quot; on &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Z1&quot;, ..., &quot;Zp&quot;, then the estimated coefficient formula_42 for &quot;X&quot; is related to a conditional odds ratio. Specifically, at the population level

:formula_43

so formula_44 is an estimate of this conditional odds ratio. The interpretation of formula_44 is as an estimate of the odds ratio between &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;X&quot; when the values of &quot;Z&quot;1, ..., &quot;Zp&quot; are held fixed.

==Insensitivity to the type of sampling==

If the data form a &quot;population sample&quot;, then the cell probabilities formula_46 are interpreted as the frequencies of each of the four groups in the population as defined by their &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; values. In many settings it is impractical to obtain a population sample, so a selected sample is used. For example, we may choose to sample units with with a given probability &quot;f&quot;, regardless of their frequency in the population (which would necessitate sampling units with with probability ). In this situation, our data would follow the following joint probabilities:

:formula_47

The &quot;odds ratio&quot; for this distribution does not depend on the value of &quot;f&quot;. This shows that the odds ratio (and consequently the log odds ratio) is invariant to non-random sampling based on one of the variables being studied. Note however that the standard error of the log odds ratio does depend on the value of &quot;f&quot;.

This fact is exploited in two important situations:

* Suppose it is inconvenient or impractical to obtain a population sample, but it is practical to obtain a convenience sample of units with different &quot;X&quot; values, such that within the and subsamples the &quot;Y&quot; values are representative of the population (i.e. they follow the correct conditional probabilities).
* Suppose the marginal distribution of one variable, say &quot;X&quot;, is very skewed. For example, if we are studying the relationship between high alcohol consumption and pancreatic cancer in the general population, the incidence of pancreatic cancer would be very low, so it would require a very large population sample to get a modest number of pancreatic cancer cases. However we could use data from hospitals to contact most or all of their pancreatic cancer patients, and then randomly sample an equal number of subjects without pancreatic cancer (this is called a &quot;case-control study&quot;).

In both these settings, the odds ratio can be calculated from the selected sample, without biasing the results relative to what would have been obtained for a population sample.

==Use in quantitative research==

Due to the widespread use of logistic regression, the odds ratio is widely used in many fields of medical and social science research. The odds ratio is commonly used in survey research, in epidemiology, and to express the results of some clinical trials, such as in case-control studies. It is often abbreviated &quot;OR&quot; in reports. When data from multiple surveys is combined, it will often be expressed as &quot;pooled OR&quot;.

==Relation to relative risk==

As explained in the &quot;Motivating Example&quot; section, the relative risk is usually better than the odds ratio for understanding the relation between risk and some variable such as radiation or a new drug. That section also explains that if the rare disease assumption holds, the odds ratio is a good approximation to relative risk and that it has some advantages over relative risk. When the rare disease assumption does not hold, the unadjusted odds ratio will be greater than the relative risk, but novel methods can easily use the same data to estimate the relative risk, risk differences, base probabilities, or other quantities.

If the absolute risk in the unexposed group is available, conversion between the two is calculated by:

: formula_48

where &quot;R&quot;&quot;C&quot; is the absolute risk of the unexposed group.

If the rare disease assumption does not apply, the odds ratio may be very different from the relative risk and should not be interpreted as a relative risk.

Consider the death rate of men and women passengers when a ship sank. Of 462 women, 154 died and 308 survived. Of 851 men, 709 died and 142 survived. Clearly a man on the ship was more likely to die than a woman, but how much more likely? Since over half the passengers died, the rare disease assumption is strongly violated.

To compute the odds ratio, note that for women the odds of dying were 1 to 2 (154/308). For men, the odds were 5 to 1 (709/142). The odds ratio is 9.99 (4.99/.5). Men had ten times the odds of dying as women.

For women, the probability of death was 33% (154/462). For men the probability was 83% (709/851). The relative risk of death is 2.5 (.83/.33). A man had 2.5 times a woman&#x27;s probability of dying.

===Confusion and exaggeration===
Odds ratios have often been confused with relative risk in medical literature. For non-statisticians, the odds ratio is a difficult concept to comprehend, and it gives a more impressive figure for the effect. However, most authors consider that the relative risk is readily understood. In one study, members of a national disease foundation were actually 3.5 times more likely than nonmembers to have heard of a common treatment for that disease – but the odds ratio was 24 and the paper stated that members were ‘more than 20-fold more likely to have heard of’ the treatment. A study of papers published in two journals reported that 26% of the articles that used an odds ratio interpreted it as a risk ratio.

This may reflect the simple process of uncomprehending authors choosing the most impressive-looking and publishable figure. But its use may in some cases be deliberately deceptive. It has been suggested that the odds ratio should only be presented as a measure of effect size when the risk ratio cannot be estimated directly, but with newly available methods it is always possible to estimate the risk ratio, which should generally be used instead.

While relative risks are potentially easier to interpret for a general audience, there are mathematical and conceptual advantages when using an odds-ratio instead of a relative risk, particularly in regression models. For that reason, there is not a consensus within the fields of epidemiology or biostatistics that relative risks or odds-ratios should be preferred when both can be validly used, such as in clinical trials and cohort studies 

==Invertibility and invariance==

The odds ratio has another unique property of being directly mathematically invertible whether analyzing the OR as either disease survival or disease onset incidence – where the OR for survival is direct reciprocal of 1/OR for risk. This is known as the &#x27;invariance of the odds ratio&#x27;. In contrast, the relative risk does not possess this mathematical invertible property when studying disease survival vs. onset incidence. This phenomenon of OR invertibility vs. RR non-invertibility is best illustrated with an example:

Suppose in a clinical trial, one has an adverse event risk of 4/100 in drug group, and 2/100 in placebo... yielding a RR=2 and OR=2.04166 for drug-vs-placebo adverse risk. However, if analysis was inverted and adverse events were instead analyzed as event-free survival, then the drug group would have a rate of 96/100, and placebo group would have a rate of 98/100—yielding a drug-vs-placebo a RR=0.9796 for survival, but an OR=0.48979. As one can see, a RR of 0.9796 is clearly not the reciprocal of a RR of 2. In contrast, an OR of 0.48979 is indeed the direct reciprocal of an OR of 2.04166.

This is again what is called the &#x27;invariance of the odds ratio&#x27;, and why a RR for survival is not the same as a RR for risk, while the OR has this symmetrical property when analyzing either survival or adverse risk. The danger to clinical interpretation for the OR comes when the adverse event rate is not rare, thereby exaggerating differences when the OR rare-disease assumption is not met. On the other hand, when the disease is rare, using a RR for survival (e.g. the RR=0.9796 from above example) can clinically hide and conceal an important doubling of adverse risk associated with a drug or exposure.

==Estimators of the odds ratio==

===Sample odds ratio===
The sample odds ratio &quot;n&quot;11&quot;n&quot;00 / &quot;n&quot;10&quot;n&quot;01 is easy to calculate, and for moderate and large samples performs well as an estimator of the population odds ratio. When one or more of the cells in the contingency table can have a small value, the sample odds ratio can be biased and exhibit high variance.

===Alternative estimators===
A number of alternative estimators of the odds ratio have been proposed to address limitations of the sample odds ratio. One alternative estimator is the conditional maximum likelihood estimator, which conditions on the row and column margins when forming the likelihood to maximize (as in Fisher&#x27;s exact test). Another alternative estimator is the Mantel–Haenszel estimator.

==Numerical examples==

The following four contingency tables contain observed cell counts, along with the corresponding sample odds ratio (&quot;OR&quot;) and sample log odds ratio (&quot;LOR&quot;):

The following joint probability distributions contain the population cell probabilities, along with the corresponding population odds ratio (&quot;OR&quot;) and population log odds ratio (&quot;LOR&quot;):

== Related statistics ==
There are various other summary statistics for contingency tables that measure association between two events, such as Yule&#x27;s &quot;Y&quot;, Yule&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot;; these two are normalized so they are 0 for independent events, 1 for perfectly correlated, −1 for perfectly negatively correlated. studied these and argued that these measures of association must be functions of the odds ratio, which he referred to as the cross-ratio.

==Odds Ratio for a Matched Case-Control Study==

A case-control study involves selecting representative samples of cases and controls who do, and do not, have some disease, respectively. These samples are usually independent of each other. The prior prevalence of exposure to some risk factor is observed in subjects from both samples. This permits the estimation of the odds ratio for disease in exposed vs. unexposed people as noted above. Sometimes, however, it makes sense to match cases to controls on one or more confounding variables. In this case, the prior exposure of interest is determined for each case and her/his matched control. The data can be summarized in the following table.

===Matched 2x2 Table===
This table gives the exposure status of the matched pairs of subjects. There are formula_49 pairs where both the case and her/his matched control were exposed, formula_50 pairs where the case patient was exposed but the control subject was not, formula_51 pairs where the control subject was exposed but the case patient was not, and formula_52 pairs were neither subject was exposed. The exposure of matched case and control pairs is correlated due to the similar values of their shared confounding variables.

The following derivation is due to Breslow &amp; Day. We consider each pair as belonging to a stratum with identical values of the confounding variables. Conditioned on belonging to the same stratum, the exposure status of cases and controls are independent of each other. For any case-control pair within the same stratum let

formula_53 be the probability that a case patient is exposed,

formula_54 be the probability that a control patient is exposed,

formula_55 be the probability that a case patient is not exposed, and

formula_56 be the probability that a control patient is not exposed.

Then the probability that a case is exposed and a control is not is formula_57, and the probability that a control is exposed and a case in not is formula_58. The within-stratum odds ratio for exposure in cases relative to controls is

formula_59

We assume that formula_60 is constant across strata. 

Now concordant pairs in which either both the case and the control are exposed, or neither are exposed tell us nothing about the odds of exposure in cases relative to the odds of exposure among controls. The probability that the case is exposed and the control is not given that the pair is discordant is 

formula_61

The distribution of formula_50 given the number of discordant pairs is binomial  ~  Bformula_63 and the maximum likelihood estimate of formula_64 is 

formula_65

Multiplying both sides of this equation by formula_66 and subtracting formula_67 gives

formula_68 and hence

formula_69.

Now formula_70 is the maximum likelihood estimate of formula_64, and formula_60 is a monotonic function of formula_70. It follows that formula_74 is the conditional maximum likelihood estimate of formula_74 given the number of discordant pairs. Rothman et al. give an alternate derivation of formula_74 by showing that it is a special case of the Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the intra-strata odds ratio for stratified 2x2 tables. They also reference Breslow &amp; Day as providing the derivation given here. 

Under the null hypothesis that formula_77.

Hence, we can test the null hypothesis that formula_78 by testing the null hypothesis that formula_79. This is done using McNemar&#x27;s test.

There are a number of ways to calculate a confidence interval for formula_64. Let formula_81 and formula_82 denote the lower and upper bound of a confidence interval for formula_64, respectively. Since formula_84, the corresponding confidence interval for formula_60 is

formula_86.

Matched 2x2 tables may also be analyzed using conditional logistic regression. This technique has the advantage of allowing users to regress case-control status against multiple risk factors from matched case-control data.

=== Example ===

McEvoy et al.
 studied the use of cell phones by drivers as a risk factor for automobile crashes in a case-crossover study. All study subjects were involved in an automobile crash requiring hospital attendance. Each driver&#x27;s cell phone use at the time of her/his crash was compared to her/his cell phone use in a control interval at the same time of day one week earlier. We would expect that a person&#x27;s cell phone use at the time of the crash would be correlated with his/her use one week earlier. Comparing usage during the crash and control intervals adjusts for driver&#x27;s characteristics and the time of day and day of the week. The data can be summarized in the following table.
There were 5 drivers who used their phones in both intervals, 27 who used them in the crash but not the control interval, 6 who used them in the control but not the crash interval, and 288 who did not use them in either interval. The odds ratio for crashing while using their phone relative to driving when not using their phone was

formula_87.

Testing the null hypothesis that formula_88 is the same as testing the null hypothesis that formula_89 given 27 out of 33 discordant pairs in which the driver was using her/his phone at the time of his crash. McNemar&#x27;s formula_90. This statistic has one degree of freedom and yields a &quot;P&quot; value of 0.0003. This allows us to reject the hypothesis that cell phone use has no effect on the risk of automobile crashes (formula_78) with a high level of statistical significance.

Using Wilson&#x27;s method, a 95% confidence interval for formula_64 is (0.6561, 0.9139). Hence, a 95% confidence interval for formula_60 is

formula_94

(McEvoy et al. analyzed their data using conditional logistic regression and obtained almost identical results to those given here. See the last row of Table 3 in their paper.)
