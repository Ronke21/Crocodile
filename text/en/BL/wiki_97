<text>A minister without portfolio is a government minister without specific responsibility as head of a government department. The sinecure is particularly common in countries ruled by coalition governments and a cabinet with decision-making authority wherein ministers without portfolio, while they may not head any particular offices or ministries, may still receive a ministerial salary and have the right to cast a vote in cabinet decisions. The office may also exist to be given to party leaders whose offices (such as a parliamentary leader) would not otherwise enable them to sit in Cabinet.

== Albania ==

In Albania, &quot;Minister without portfolio&quot; are considered members of the government who generally are not in charge of a special department, do not have headquarters or offices and usually do not have administration or staff. This post was first introduced in 1918 during the Përmeti II government, otherwise known as the Government of Durrës. The members of this cabinet were referred to as &quot;Delegatë pa portofol&quot; (delegate without portfolio). The name &quot;minister&quot; was used two years later, during the government of Sulejman Delvina. In the 1990s it was common the usage of the name &quot;Sekretar Shteti&quot; (Secretary of State) to refer to such a position. Mostly these roles were given to smaller allies by the leading parties. Nowadays the name &quot;Ministër i Shtetit&quot; (State Minister or Minister of State) is used.

== Australia ==
Willie Kelly was given the title in the Cook Ministry from June 1913 to September 1914.

Stanley Bruce was given the title of minister without portfolio when he took up his position in 1932 as the Commonwealth Minister in London. He was given the title by Lyons&#x27; Cabinet so that he could better represent the PM and his colleagues free from the limitations of a portfolio. In this case the title was a promotion and carried considerable responsibilities.

== Bangladesh ==
Bangladesh appoints ministers without portfolio during cabinet reshuffles or fresh appointments. Ministers are not usually appointed without portfolio as a coalition negotiation – all long run ministers end up with a portfolio. Suranjit Sengupta was a minister without portfolio in Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s second government. The most recent minister without portfolio is from the Interim government of Bangladesh, Mahfuz Alam who is also an adviser to the chief adviser

The Constitution determines that the Ministries (and also other bodies headed by a Minister of State) are provided for by law, so the Federal Government has less freedom to create and reformulate portfolios as it happens in other cabinets.

=== Extraordinary minister ===
During the brief parliamentary experience, the position of &quot;&quot;Extraordinary Minister&quot; was instituted to provide for political and administrative affairs within the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, it was equivalent in prerogatives, advantages and salaries to a Minister of State. There were no nominations after the return to presidentialism, but a 1964 law created an &quot;Extraordinary Ministry&quot; to coordinate some related bodies that would be equivalent to a ministry of the interior. The reorganization of federal public administration in 1967 provided for the appointment of up to four Extraordinary Ministers to perform temporary duties of a relevant nature.

Currently, the legislation requires that the Coordinator of the Government Transition Cabinet (the team of the candidate elected to the office of President of the Republic) be appointed as an Extraordinary Minister if the nominee is a Senator or a Federal Deputy. In 2018, then President Michel Temer issued a provisional measure creating an &quot;Extraordinary Ministry of Public Security&quot;&quot;, it became a common ministry after National Congress converted the provisional measure into law.

==Canada==
While the minister without portfolio is seen by some as a mere sinecure appointment, it has been a role that numerous political notables have played over time, including future Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, who filled the role in a Pearson cabinet in the 1960s; John Turner also &quot;kept a seat warm&quot; in a Pearson cabinet. Notable Conservatives who filled the role include R. B. Bennett, and Arthur Meighen; however, Meighen served this role after he had been prime minister.

The title of minister without portfolio has been used off and on; in recent times, though, the title has fallen out of favour, and the penultimate minister without portfolio, Gilles Lamontagne, was promoted to postmaster general in 1978. The practice has continued primarily under the guise of ministers of state without responsibilities in the ministers&#x27; titles.

The position has also been filled on the federal or provincial level by experienced politicians near the end of their careers as a way of allowing them to counsel the government and take on projects without the burdens associated with administering a government department.

In January 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Jim Carr as a minister without portfolio, in addition to his role as special representative to the Prairies. Carr had previously served as a cabinet minister until November 2019, leaving as a consequence of his diagnosis with multiple myeloma.

==Denmark==
Three &quot;control ministers&quot; served as ministers without portfolio during World War I.

After the Liberation of Denmark in May 1945, the first Danish cabinet included four ministers without portfolio. Among these were Danish ambassador to the U.S. Henrik Kauffmann, who had conducted his own foreign policy throughout the war and refused to follow orders from Copenhagen as long as Denmark remained occupied by a foreign power. Kauffmann served in this capacity from 12 May to 7 November 1945. The three other holders of this title had joined the cabinet a few days before – Aksel Larsen (Communist Party of Denmark), Kr. Juul Christensen (Danish Unity) and Frode Jakobsen (Social Democrats).

Lise Østergaard held a position as minister without portfolio with special attention to foreign policy issues in Anker Jørgensen&#x27;s cabinet from 26 February 1977 to 28 February 1980.

Anders Fogh Rasmussen appointed Bertel Haarder as minister without portfolio, but effectively Minister for European Affairs. Haarder served in this capacity from 27 November 2001 to 18 February 2005. The reason for appointing a minister without a ministry was the Danish European Union Presidency of 2002. Haarder was considered the most experienced Danish politician on European affairs.

Since 1949, a Federal Minister for Special Affairs (&quot;Bundesminister für besondere Aufgaben&quot;) is a member of the Federal Government that does not have charge of a Federal Ministry, although the ministry is now commonly assigned to the Heads of the German Chancellery to give this important government functionary cabinet-rank. The ministry was first created in October 1953 to give a ministry level position to Franz Josef Strauss, but has been used almost exclusively for the Head of the Federal Chancellery since the 1960s. A notable exception occurred in the course of German reunification when four members of East Germany&#x27;s last government were made &quot;Minister for Special Affairs&quot; from October 3, 1990, to January 1991.

== Greece ==
The position of a Minister without portfolio was first created in 1918, with Emmanouil Repoulis being the first Minister without portfolio. Previously, the term had been used to describe Prime Ministers who had not undertaken any secondary Ministerial position (e.g. Ministry of Foreign Affairs). Prominent politicians like Georgios Papandreou, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Napoleon Zervas and Spyros Markezinis served as Ministers without portfolio during their career, while novelist Nikos Kazantzakis had a brief, 46-day-long tenure as Minister without portfolio in Sofoulis&#x27; 1945 cabinet.

In 1991, the position was renamed to Minister of State; the last person to be designated Minister without portfolio and simultaneously the first Minister of State, is Mikis Theodorakis.

==Indonesia==
Since the inception of the state, Indonesia had ministers without portfolio, usually given the title &quot;Menteri Negara&quot; (&#x27;State Minister&#x27;). The number was not fixed, entirely depended on the behest of the President. Although not explicitly forbidden, Law No. 39/2008 on State Ministries mandated that a ministry must have specific function and responsibilities and also must have minimum number of directorates and other ministerial apparatuses, thus formation of minister without portfolio is currently unlikely in post-Reformation Indonesia.

Below is the list of ministers without portfolio that ever existed in Indonesian history.

===Presidential Cabinet (19 August – 14 November 1945)===
* Mohammad Amir
* Sartono 
* Alexander Andries Maramis
* Oto Iskandar di Nata

===First Sjahrir Cabinet (11 November 1945 – 28 February 1946)===

* Danoedirdja Setiaboedi

===Sixth Development Cabinet (6 June – 1 October 1997) ===
The cabinet was unique, with President Suharto moved the Minister of Information Harmoko to the office of State Minister of Special Affairs () on 6 June 1997. The Ministry of Special Affairs was dissolved on 1 October 1997, following the inauguration of next-term&#x27;s parliament and the appointment of Harmoko as its speaker.

==Ireland==
The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939 allows a Minister to be a member of the Government of Ireland who does not have charge of a Department of State, such a person to be known as a &quot;Minister without portfolio&quot;. Such a minister may be given a specific style or title. The only substantive minister without portfolio has been Frank Aiken, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures during World War II. By the Emergency Powers Act 1939 then in force, the Minister for Defence was able to delegate some competences to him.

On a number of occasions a minister has been appointed to an incoming government with the title of a new Department of State. Between the date of appointment and the date of creation of the department, such a minister is formally a minister without portfolio.
When Helen McEntee took six months&#x27; maternity leave on 28 April 2021, her portfolio as Minister for Justice was reassigned to Heather Humphreys, in addition to Humphreys&#x27;s existing portfolio as Minister for Social Protection and Minister for Rural and Community Development. McEntee remained a member of the coalition government as minister without portfolio, and was reassigned to the Department of Justice on 1 November 2021. On 25 November 2022, Heather Humphreys was again appointed as Minister for Justice to facilitate a second period of six months&#x27; maternity leave from December.

==Israel==
It is common practice in Israel to appoint ministers without portfolio as part of the coalition negotiations, as it allows small coalition partners a seat at the cabinet table. All cabinets in recent years have had at least some such appointment. The Governance Law passed in 2013 forbade ministers without portfolio effectively ending the practice, however in spite of some objections, after the 2015 elections this issue was revisited in the Knesset and it was allowed for the practice to resume.

==Japan==
In Japan, is not defined by law. The does not forbid ministers who do not serve any ministries, establishing the existence of minister without portfolio.

There are two meanings of minister without portfolio in Japan: The broader sense is a minister who is neither Prime Minister of Japan or ministers of Cabinet of Japan, while the narrower sense is further from the broader sense - which specifically refers to ministers without ministries and certain titles such as Chair of the National Public Safety Commission, Chief Cabinet Secretary, or Minister of State for Special Missions (ja). In Japan, a minister without portfolio usually refers to the narrower sense.

There has not been minister without portfolio since Takashi Sasagawa of the Mori Cabinet in 2001. Most ministers without serving ministries in a cabinet will be Ministers of State for Special Missions in practice.

==Kenya==
In Kenya, ministers without portfolio are not common. However three individuals have held the position in the country&#x27;s history. They are:
*Chunilal Madan (1956–1957) He was the first Kenyan minister with Asian descent and also country&#x27;s first minister without portfolio. He was appointed to oversee Kenya&#x27;s Colonial government operations prior to being appointed as a judge in the country&#x27;s Supreme court in 1957.
*Raphael Tuju (2018–2022). He was appointed by Uhuru Kenyatta to oversee government operations in his second term of presidency.
*Cleophas Wakhungu Malala (2023-to date). He was appointed as the secretary general of the ruling party UDA to oversee the operations of the ruling party and push the hustler agenda for the next five years.

== Malta ==
* Carmelo Abela (2020–2022)
* Joe Mizzi (1996–1998)

==Netherlands==
A minister without portfolio in the Netherlands is a minister that does not head a specific ministry, but assumes the same power and responsibilities as a minister that does. The minister is responsible for a specific part of another minister&#x27;s policy field. In that sense, a minister without portfolio is comparable to a &quot;staatssecretaris&quot; (state secretary or junior minister) in Dutch politics, who also falls under another ministry and is responsible for a specific part of that minister&#x27;s policy field. However, one distinct difference is that a minister without portfolio is a member of the council of ministers and can vote in it, whereas a state secretary is not. The minister for development cooperation has always been a minister without portfolio.

In the second Balkenende cabinet there were three ministers without portfolio: Agnes van Ardenne (Development Cooperation), Rita Verdonk (Integration and Immigration) and Alexander Pechtold (Government Reform and Kingdom Relations).

The third Rutte cabinet had four ministers without portfolio: Sigrid Kaag (Development Cooperation), Sander Dekker (Legal Protection), Martin van Rijn (Medical Care), and Arie Slob (Primary and Secondary Education and Media).

The fourth Rutte cabinet has eight ministers without portfolio: Carola Schouten (Poverty, Participation and Pensions), Liesje Schreinemacher (Development Cooperation), Rob Jetten (Climate and Energy), Conny Helder (Long-Term healthcare and Sport), Christianne van der Wal (Nature and Nitrogen reduction), Franc Weerwind (Legal Protection), Hugo de Jonge (Housing and Urban Development), and Dennis Wiersma (Primary and Secondary Education and Media).

==New Zealand==

In the Third National Government, Keith Holyoake was made a Minister of State 1975–77 after he had retired as party leader, and in the Fourth National Government Robin Gray was made a Minister of State 1993–96 after he was replaced as Speaker (though he was also Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs). Both appointments were considered sinecures to avoid their return as &#x27;backbenchers&#x27;.

* Vítor Alves (2nd, 3rd provisional government)

After the 1st Constitutional Government (1976–1978), there haven&#x27;t been any appointments of ministers without portfolio.

A similar but not sinecural cabinet position, that of Minister Adjunct (&quot;ministro adjunto&quot;), who does not head a particular ministry but is instead tasked with the general interministerial measures found in the government programme, has been created in some Portuguese governments.

==Serbia==

From 2007 to 2008, Dragan Đilas was a &quot;minister without portfolio&quot; in charge of the National Investment Plan.
* Milan Krkobabić (2016)
* Slavica Đukić Dejanović (2017)
* Nenad Popović (2017)

== Singapore ==
In Singapore, the appointment holder is known as a &#x27;Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office&#x27;.

== Spain ==
In Spain, in addition to the Ministers in charge of a Department, there may be Ministers without a portfolio, who will be responsible for certain government functions. In the event that there are Ministers without a portfolio, the scope of their powers, the administrative structure, as well as the material and personal resources attached to it will be determined by Royal Decree.

==Sweden==
* Dag Hammarskjöld (1951–1953).

==United Kingdom==

==United States==
The Vice President of the United States is a member of the Cabinet but heads no department. As such, the Vice President may be assigned to policy areas of the President&#x27;s choosing such as foreign diplomacy (Richard Nixon), space programs (Lyndon B. Johnson) or public health (Mike Pence). Prior to the mid-19th century, the Vice President&#x27;s position as President of the Senate caused the office to be seen as primarily legislative in nature, and as such they were not assigned to deal with public policy.

Cabinet-level officials are president-designated additional members of the Cabinet, which can vary under each president. Most of them head no department, and some of them are not officers of the United States. For example, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget is the head of the Office of Management and Budget, which is an office within a department, namely the Executive Office of the President of the United States headed by the White House Chief of Staff. Similar situations apply (or applied) for the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Trade Representative, Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, National Security Advisor, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

An individual who has great influence on government affairs without holding formal office might be described as a &quot;minister without portfolio&quot;. Such an appellation is completely unofficial (possibly intended jokingly or disparagingly) and merely serves to underscore the extent of the individual&#x27;s already-existing influence; it does not grant any new influence or power. Examples include Bernard Baruch, Arthur Burns, and Ivanka Trump.

Herbert Hoover, the Secretary of Commerce under presidents Harding and Coolidge, took the position on the understanding that he would have input on all matters pertaining to the economy. He used this concession so eagerly that Treasury official S. Parker Gilbert dubbed him &quot;Under-Secretary of all other departments.&quot;

== Vietnam ==
In the first government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam founded by Hồ Chí Minh after the August Revolution in September 1945, Cù Huy Cận and Nguyễn Văn Xuân were assigned the &quot;Minister without Portfolio&quot; positions. In January 1946, the &quot;Provisional Coalition Government&quot; was installed, and Nguyen Van Xuan retained the post of Minister without Portfolio while Cu Huy Can was elevated to the Ministry of Agriculture. From November 1946 to early 1955, the Viet Minh (and later the Worker&#x27;s Party)-led &quot;New Government&quot; fought against the return of France to Indochina and the post Ministers without Portfolio was held by Nguyễn Văn Tố, Đặng Văn Hướng and Bồ Xuân Luật. Since the 1954 Geneva Convention, the position has been vacant, except briefly during the 1960–1964 cabinet elected by the 2nd National Assembly, where Lê Văn Hiến occupied the post &quot;Minister without Portfolio and Deputy Chair of the State Planning Commission.&quot;

In 2014, Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng tasked the Cabinet Office to examine the possibility of re-introducing the post &quot;Minister without Portfolio.&quot; There have been no further developments since.

<doc id="410165" wikidata="Q357832" url="?curid=410165" title="John B. Larson">
<text>John Barry Larson (born July 22, 1948) is an American politician and businessman serving as the U.S. representative for since 1999. The district is based in the state capital, Hartford. A member of the Democratic Party, Larson chaired the House Democratic Caucus during the 111th and 112th United States Congress.

==Early life, education, and career==
Larson was born in Hartford, but has spent most of his life in nearby East Hartford. He grew up in a public housing project. He was educated at East Hartford High School and Central Connecticut State University. He worked as a high school history teacher and an assistant athletics coach at George J. Penney High School (Penney High later merged with East Hartford High School).

Larson began his career as the co-owner of an insurance agency in East Hartford before entering public service. In 1971, he was selected as a Senior Fellow to the Yale University Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy by Head Start Program founder Edward Zigler. He transitioned into politics in 1977, when he served one term on the East Hartford Board of Education. He then served two terms on the East Hartford Town Council.

In 1982, Larson was elected to the Connecticut Senate from the 3rd district, based in East Hartford. He served six terms in that body, the last four as president pro tempore.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1994, Larson left the state senate and sought the Democratic nomination for governor of Connecticut, losing to Bill Curry in the primary. After being defeated for governor, Larson entered private business for several years but was able to maintain his political credentials.

Due in part to service in the Democratic Party and his local connections in the state, he narrowly defeated Secretary of State Miles S. Rapoport in the Democratic primary for the 1st district when 17-year incumbent Barbara Kennelly gave up the seat to run for governor in 1998. The 1st has long been the most Democratic district in Connecticut, and Larson&#x27;s victory in November was a foregone conclusion. He has been reelected eleven times with no substantive opposition.

On February 1, 2006, Larson was elected vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus. The previous vice chair, Jim Clyburn, became chair when Bob Menendez was appointed to the United States Senate. After the Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 elections, Larson opted not to run for caucus chair—a post that went to former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Rahm Emanuel—instead running unopposed for reelection as vice chair. After being reelected in 2008, Larson was elected chair of the caucus for the 111th Congress, after Emanuel was named White House Chief of Staff.

===Tenure===

====Energy and the environment====
Larson has introduced various pieces of legislation in attempts to nationalize the US&#x27;s energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to protect the environment. He cosponsored the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 &quot;to move the United States toward greater energy independence and security, to increase the production of clean renewable fuels, to protect consumers, to increase the efficiency of products, buildings, and vehicles, to promote research on and deploy greenhouse gas capture and storage options, and to improve the energy performance of the Federal Government, and for other purposes.&quot; According to Larson, &quot;I have become convinced of the need for comprehensive legislation to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we are emitting into the environment.&quot; His stances on environmental protection have earned him a rating of 100% with the League of Conservation Voters.

====Economic issues====
In 2010 Larson introduced the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, authorizing the creation of the Small Business Lending Fund Program administered by the Treasury Department to make capital investments in eligible institutions, in order to increase the availability of credit for small businesses. Larson was a strong advocate for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which increased federal spending in infrastructure, education, health and energy while expanding some welfare and social security programs. His liberal stance on government spending has earned him a rating of 9% with Citizens Against Government Waste, a conservative anti-government spending interest group.

Larson received media attention for scolding members of Congress for shutting down the government on September 30, 2013.

Larson was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

<doc id="410168" wikidata="Q334163" url="?curid=410168" title="Patrick Mayhew">
<text>Patrick Barnabas Burke Mayhew, Baron Mayhew of Twysden, (11 September 1929 – 25 June 2016) was a British barrister and politician.

==Early life==
Mayhew was born in Cookham, Berkshire, on 11 September 1929. His father, George Mayhew, was a decorated army officer turned oil executive; his mother, Sheila Roche, descended from members of the Anglo-Irish Protestant ascendancy, was a relative of James Roche, 3rd Baron Fermoy, an Irish National Federation MP for Kerry East. Through his father, Mayhew was descended from the Victorian social commentator Henry Mayhew. He was educated at Tonbridge School, an all boys public school in Tonbridge, Kent.

He then served as an officer in the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards, studied law at Balliol College, Oxford, and was president of the Oxford University Conservative Association and of the Oxford Union. He was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1955.

==Political career==
Mayhew contested Dulwich in 1970, but the incumbent Labour member, Sam Silkin, beat him by 895 votes. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Tunbridge Wells constituency from its creation at the February 1974 general election, standing down at the 1997 election.

He was Under Secretary of Employment from 1979 to 1981, then Minister of State at the Home Office from 1981 to 1983. After this, he served as Solicitor General for England and Wales from 1983 to 1987, and then Attorney General for England and Wales and simultaneously Attorney General for Northern Ireland from 1987 to 1992.

He was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 1992 to 1997.

He was one of only five Ministers (Tony Newton, Kenneth Clarke, Malcolm Rifkind and Lynda Chalker are the others) to serve throughout the whole 18 years of the Governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major. This represents the longest uninterrupted Ministerial service in Britain since Lord Palmerston in the early 19th century.

==Honours and awards==
Mayhew was knighted in 1983. On 12 June 1997, he was given a life peerage as Baron Mayhew of Twysden, of Kilndown in the County of Kent. He retired from the House of Lords on 1 June 2015.

==Personal life==
In 1963, Mayhew married the Rev. Jean Gurney, and they had four sons. His son Jerome Mayhew is the Conservative MP for the constituency of Broadland and Fakenham (previously Broadland) in Norfolk since the 2019 general election.

Mayhew, a devout Anglican, was a churchwarden at Christ Church, Kilndown.

Mayhew suffered from cancer and Parkinson&#x27;s disease in his later years. He died from cancer at his home on 25 June 2016, aged 86.

<doc id="410169" wikidata="Q2603131" url="?curid=410169" title="Rob Simmons">
<text>Robert Ruhl &quot;Rob&quot; Simmons (born February 11, 1943) is an American politician and retired U.S. Army colonel who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007, representing Connecticut&#x27;s 2nd congressional district as a Republican.

Simmons unsuccessfully ran as a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator from Connecticut in 2010.

Simmons was formerly Chairman of the Yankee Institute for Public Policy. On November 3, 2015, he was elected First Selectman in his hometown of Stonington, Connecticut, which he once represented in Congress. He defeated the incumbent, George Crouse. He did not seek reelection in 2019.

==Military career==
Simmons was born in New York City and attended Haverford College, graduating in 1965. He enlisted in the United States Army as a private, serving in active duty from 1965 to 1969. He graduated from Infantry Officer Candidate School in 1967 and became a commissioned officer. He fought in the Vietnam War and earned two Bronze Star Medals for his service. He was in Vietnam for 19 months.

Simmons served in the United States Army Reserve as a Military Intelligence Officer from 1969 to 2003, retiring at the rank of full colonel. He led the 434th Military Intelligence Detachment (Strategic) affiliated with Yale University, and in this capacity led the writing of the &quot;Open Source Intelligence Guide for the Military Intelligence Officer.&quot; Under his command, the unit was selected as the best small unit in the U.S. Army Reserve in 1996 by the Reserve Officers Association.

==Early political career==
Simmons joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1969, working as an Operations Officer for a decade, including five years on assignment overseas in East Asia. He ran the Phu Yen Province Interrogation Center from November 1970 to June 1972, according to an article by Douglas Valentine in &quot;Everything You Know is Wrong&quot;, and he &quot;mounted numerous paramilitary and psychological warfare operations against&quot; the Viet Cong. Simmons was awarded the CIA&#x27;s Agency Seal Medal in 1985. In 1979, he earned a Master of Public Administration from Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

In 1979, he became a staff member for Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, and then the Staff Director for the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1981 under the chairmanship of Senator Barry Goldwater (R-AZ).

Simmons then became a professor of political science at Yale College and at the University of Connecticut. In 1991, he became a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives, replacing incumbent Frank Turek who died in office. He represented the 43rd district before running for Congress.

==U.S. Congressional tenure==
===Overview===

Simmons was a member of the House Armed Services Committee and was involved in issues concerning the district&#x27;s major defense presence at the Electric Boat submarine shipyard in Groton and the nearby Naval Submarine Base New London. In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) targeted the United States Navy&#x27;s Groton submarine base for closure. Simmons led the successful fight to save the base and the BRAC removed it from its closure list on August 24, 2005.

Simmons also served on the House Homeland Security Committee as chairman of the Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment. He was a strong advocate of improved intelligence-sharing among federal, state, and local authorities. Simmons also championed Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) on Capital Hill, where he helped to legally define open source intelligence in the 2006 National Defense Authorization Act, requiring the Department of Defense to establish an OSINT program. He also spearheaded an effort to establish an open source intelligence unit at the Department of Homeland Security.

Despite being in the most Democratic GOP-held seat in the nation and being targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a possible pickup in 2002, Simmons fought off a challenge from Democrat Joe Courtney, a former state representative from Vernon, winning 54% to 46%.

In 2004, Simmons defeated his Democratic challenger, Norwich City Councilman Jim Sullivan, by a margin of 54% to 46%.

In 2005, the NRCC listed Simmons as one of their most vulnerable members and his seat was widely seen as a possible Democratic pickup in 2006. Courtney was once again the Democratic nominee in 2006 and the race was considered a toss-up.

On election night Simmons trailed Courtney by 167 votes out of over 242,000 votes cast. This margin was small enough to trigger an automatic recount under Connecticut law. During this recount, elections officials discovered several errors in the original vote. The recount concluded on November 14 giving Courtney an 83-vote victory over Simmons.

As Simmons fared far better than other defeated Republican incumbents it was speculated he would try for a political comeback in 2008, which he did not rule out in conceding the 2006 election to Courtney. However, on March 4, 2007, on an episode of Face the State, he stated that he would not challenge Courtney in 2008. Simmons was the last Republican to garner even 40 percent of the vote in this district until 2022.

==Post congressional career==
===Business advocate===
On February 26, 2007, Simmons was nominated by Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell to become the State&#x27;s first Business Advocate. The Office of the Business Advocate was established as part of the Governor&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Jobs for the 21st Century&quot; Act (PA 06-83), for the purpose of providing centralized assistance to businesses in the state, and to pro-actively provide assistance to businesses of broader economic significance to the State. He served until December 2008.

===2010 U.S. Senate campaign===
On March 15, 2009, Simmons announced his intention to challenge Senator Chris Dodd for the United States Senate in 2010. A May 2009 poll showed Simmons leading Dodd by six points, with the lead growing to 13 points in a December 2009 poll. Sen. Chris Dodd however announced in January 2010 that he would not be seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate due to high pressure from the Democratic Party leaders, falling poll numbers, and controversy over business dealings with Countrywide Financial.

While Simmons originally led in the polls early on, Linda McMahon gained traction on him in the primary and won at the Republican convention. McMahon, a billionaire, spent more than $22 million through the primary, while Simmons spent under $3 million. Simmons was deeply disappointed by his loss and later suspended his campaign. In late July – two weeks before the primary – however, he re-entered the race by airing TV ads, participating in debates, and accepting interviews with editorial boards. Simmons, however, went on to lose the primary to McMahon. General election polls showed Simmons as the more electable candidate, and McMahon would lose the election by 12%.

== Later career ==
In 2014, he controversially endorsed Democrat Andrew Maynard for re-election to the Connecticut State Senate, despite the fact that Maynard was incapable of fulfilling his duties due to a brain injury that he had suffered. This was done so that Senator Maynard would be able to enjoy the retirement benefits of a state employee, which he otherwise would not have been entitled to as a four-term senator. On the Lee Elcee Show radio program, Simmons reflected on how Maynard had introduced his daughter and her husband. 

===Stonington First Selectman===
In 2015, Simmons was elected First Selectman of Stonington, Connecticut. He was sworn into office on November 16, 2015. In 2019, he did not seek reelection for First Selectman. He was succeeded by Danielle Chesebrough. She took over on November 18, 2019.

==Personal life==
Simmons is married to the former Edith Heidi Paffard. They have a son, Robert, and a daughter, Jane. He is an Episcopalian.

<doc id="410170" wikidata="Q1968113" url="?curid=410170" title="Duke of St Albans">
<text>Duke of [[St Albans]] is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1684 for Charles Beauclerk, 1st Earl of Burford, then 14 years old. King Charles II had accepted that Burford was his illegitimate son by Nell Gwyn, an actress, and awarded him the dukedom just as he had conferred those of Monmouth, Southampton, Grafton, Northumberland, and Richmond and Lennox on his other illegitimate sons who married.

The subsidiary titles of the Duke are Earl of Burford, in the County of Oxford (1676), Baron Heddington, in the same (1676) and Baron Vere, of Hanworth in the County of Middlesex (1750). The Earldom and the Barony of Heddington are in the Peerage of England, and the Barony of Vere is in the Peerage of Great Britain. The dukes hold the hereditary title of Grand Falconer of England, and until the end of the 18th century they were Hereditary Registrars of the Court of Chancery.

By tradition, the Earldom and Vere barony are used as courtesy titles by the duke&#x27;s heir apparent and &quot;his&quot; heir apparent respectively.

Until the 20th century, the country seats of the dukes of St Albans included Bestwood Lodge in Nottinghamshire, which was given to the 1st Duke&#x27;s mother, the celebrated actress and mistress to Charles II Nell Gwyn. The 10th Duke made it his principal residence, but in 1939 the 12th Duke sold it. It is now a hotel. Another seat was Upper Gatton Park in Surrey. The 12th Duke also inherited Newtown Anner House (near Clonmel, County Tipperary), which continued to be a family seat in the 1940s until it was sold in the mid-20th century. Today the house is privately owned and not open to the public.

The 13th and present dukes have not inherited landed estates or country houses.

The accepted pronunciation of Beauclerk is reflected in frequent early renderings Beauclaire: .

<text>Rosa Luisa DeLauro ( ; born March 2, 1943) is an American politician who is in her 18th term as the U.S. representative for , having served since 1991. She is a member of the Democratic Party. The district is based in New Haven and includes most of its suburbs. DeLauro is the dean of Connecticut&#x27;s congressional delegation.

In 2020, DeLauro was selected as chair of the House Appropriations Committee for the 117th Congress, succeeding Nita Lowey and becoming the second woman to hold the position. She co-chaired the House Democratic Steering Committee from 2003 to 2021. 

In Congress, DeLauro is known for the bright colors and bold patterns of her fashion, as well as her cropped bob hairstyle, which also features standout colors.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
DeLauro was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to an Italian-American family, the daughter of Luisa &quot;Louise&quot; (née Canestri), a New Haven alderwoman, and Theodore J. &quot;Ted&quot; DeLauro, an Italian immigrant. She earned her high school diploma from The Academy of Our Lady of Mercy, Lauralton Hall in Milford, Connecticut. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York, attended the London School of Economics and earned a master&#x27;s degree in international politics from Columbia University. Before entering the House, DeLauro worked as Senator Chris Dodd&#x27;s chief of staff and campaign manager, was the executive director of EMILY&#x27;s List, and coordinated 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis&#x27;s tristate area campaign.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1990, four-term incumbent U.S. Representative Bruce Morrison of Connecticut&#x27;s 3rd congressional district retired in order to run for governor of Connecticut. DeLauro sought the open seat and quickly consolidated Democratic support behind her, earning Morrison&#x27;s endorsement and prompting State Representative Mike Lawlor&#x27;s withdrawal from the campaign. DeLauro defeated Republican State Senator Thomas Scott 52%–48% in a particularly brutal general election, in which Scott said that DeLauro had kept her maiden name only to appeal to the region&#x27;s Italian voters, and state Republican chair Richard Foley called DeLauro &quot;Walter Mondale in drag&quot;. The campaign was equally combative over policy matters, with both candidates&#x27; microphones cut off during a radio debate after repeated attacks over abortion and capital punishment.

The district has since reverted to form, and DeLauro has never faced another contest nearly as close as her first. She has been reelected 16 times, never with less than 56% of the vote.

====2006====

In 2006, DeLauro was reelected to a ninth term, defeating Republican nominee Joseph Vollano with 76% of the vote.

====2008====

DeLauro was reelected to a tenth term with 77% of the vote.

====2010====

DeLauro was reelected to an 11th term with 65% of the vote against Connecticut Republican Party treasurer Jerry Labriola Jr.

====2012====

DeLauro was reelected to a 12th term with 74.6% of the vote against Republican nominee Wayne Winsley, a former member of the U.S. Navy.

====2014====

DeLauro was reelected to a 13th term with 67.1% of the vote against Republican nominee James Brown, a high school math teacher.

====2016====

DeLauro was reelected to a 14th term with 69% of the vote against Republican nominee Angel Cadena, a former candidate for Connecticut State Comptroller.

====2018====

DeLauro was reelected to a 15th term with 64.6% of the vote against Cadena.

====2020====

DeLauro was reelected to a 16th term with 58.7% of the vote to Margaret Streicker&#x27;s 39.8%.

====2022====
DeLauro was reelected to a 17th term with 56.8% of the vote to Lesley DeNardis&#x27;s 40.7%.

====2024====
DeLauro was reelected to an 18th term with 58.9% of the vote to Michael Massey&#x27;s 41.1%.

=== Tenure ===
DeLauro is part of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and one of the Congressional Progressive Caucus&#x27;s founding members.

DeLauro is interested in health policy issues, particularly women&#x27;s health. She has introduced bills aimed at improving cancer treatment and research and women&#x27;s health policies. As chair of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Food and Drug Administration, she has criticized the FDA&#x27;s failures to protect the public from unsafe foods and medical products.

On February 2, 2008, DeLauro endorsed Barack Obama for President.

On October 3, 2008, DeLauro voted a second time for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. She worked to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. She has urged politicians to be &quot;big thinkers&quot; on universal health care.

On December 17, 2008, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that DeLauro was &quot;a top contender&quot; for Labor Secretary in the Obama administration. Obama nominated Hilda Solis for the position.

DeLauro was critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act.

DeLauro was a supporter of David Bonior in his race against Steny Hoyer for House Majority Whip in 1991, seconding his nomination at a meeting of the Democratic caucus. DeLauro cited their work together during the Iran-Contra scandal, and said that Bonior&#x27;s &quot;position as whip will not impact the momentum the choice issue has in Congress right now.&quot;

DeLauro has spoken about child care, arguing, &quot;It is time to build a permanent child care infrastructure that respects and values women in the workforce&quot; in a July 2021 article published in &quot;The American Prospect&quot; and on her official website.

DeLauro was among the 46 Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.

In December 2024, DeLauro garnered attention for a speech in the House during debate on H.R. 10515, a bill to avert a government shutdown, where she called Elon Musk &quot;President Musk&quot; and called attention to his investments in China. Musk shot back at DeLauro by calling her an “awful creature” and saying that he believes the Democratic congresswoman “needs to be expelled from Congress!”

**In addition to the below, as Ranking Member of the committee, Rep. DeLauro is entitled to sit as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member in all subcommittee meetings, per the committee rules.

== Political positions ==

=== Abortion ===
DeLauro supports abortion rights. As chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, she has opposed the Hyde Amendment based on evidence of its discriminatory impact.

In 2006, she voted against the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act.

=== Guns ===
DeLauro has voted for stronger regulation of firearms. In 2006 she voted against the Trigger Lock Amendment that ends the use of funds from the Commerce Department FY2007 Appropriation bill to enforce laws requiring guns to be sold with locks. In 1999 DeLauro voted to increase the amount of time given to perform background checks from 24 hours to 72 hours. In 1998 she voted to increase the minimum gun crime sentence. On January 14, 2013, she introduced a bill allowing for the voluntary surrender of assault-type weapons with compensation in the form of tax credits. She has an F rating from the NRA.

=== Campaign finance and government reform ===
In 2010, DeLauro voted for a bill mandating new disclosure requirements for political advertising. She voted against the 527 Reform Act of 2005, an act that put an end to party spending limits for candidates during general elections, and against the 527 Reform Act of 2006. DeLauro also helped to pass the Lobbying and Donation Regulations bill that put in place new regulations on lobbyists and donations to Congress members.

In 2002 DeLauro voted for the Help America Vote Act of 2002. This act provided $3.9 billion to modernize technology and create new programs to reach a higher standard and to make voting an easier process for disabled citizens, military personnel, citizens living abroad, and first-time voters without valid identification. In 2006 DeLauro voted against the Federal Election Integrity Act of 2006, which required voters to show a government-issued photo ID before voting.

=== Sponsored bills ===
DeLauro sponsored the Birth Defects Prevention, Risk Reduction, and Awareness Act of 2010 (H.R. 5462). This bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a birth defects prevention, risk reduction, and awareness program. The program aims to increase awareness of pregnancy and breastfeeding by starting a nationwide media campaign and provides grants for research on certain exposures that affect pregnancy and breastfed infants. In November 2010, it was received by the Senate and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. It was not voted on by the Senate.

=== HR 875 ===
DeLauro introduced HR 875, the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009. This legislation is aimed at reforming the food safety responsibilities handled by the FDA. The introduction of this bill represents a potential conflict of interest because of her husband Stanley Greenberg&#x27;s connection to agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto.

=== Hurricane Irene ===
In August 2011, the 3rd district suffered extreme damage when Hurricane Irene made landfall along the Connecticut coastline. Many homes were destroyed in East Haven and other shore communities and many Connecticut residents lost power for days. When Irene hit the state and during the immediate aftermath, DeLauro was vacationing along Italy&#x27;s Amalfi Coast and was not anticipated to return until five days after the storm had passed. A &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; column rated DeLauro&#x27;s storm response an &quot;F&quot;. DeLauro told the &quot;New Haven Register&quot; she had &quot;no apology for taking a vacation&quot; and being out of state during the storm.

=== Health care ===
In July 2014, DeLauro introduced the &quot;Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tax Act&quot;, also known as the &quot;SWEET Act&quot;, which would impose a one-cent excise tax per teaspoon of caloric sweetener in soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, and sweet teas (roughly nine cents on a 12-ounce soda). &quot;This act is intended to discourage excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by increasing the price of these products&quot;, according to the text of the legislation. DeLauro and other supporters of the act argued that it could help address the national epidemics of obesity and diabetes by discouraging consumers from consuming the products and also raise money to fund prevention, treatment programs, research and dietary education to help reduce the costs of related health problems. The bill was co-sponsored by several House members and progressed on to the House Energy and Commerce committee for Health and the House Ways and Means committee, but went no further. It was opposed by the American Beverage Association and the National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA), which said, &quot;People don&#x27;t support taxes and bans on common grocery items, like soft drinks&quot; and that sweetened beverages &quot;are not the main source of added sugars for children and teens and that a tax on sugary drinks unfairly singles out the industry.&quot;

=== 2020 House Appropriations Committee ===
After Nita Lowey announced her retirement, DeLauro, Marcy Kaptur and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz were candidates for chair of the Appropriations Committee. DeLauro&#x27;s caucus chose her to lead the committee in a 148–79 vote in December 2020.

===Israel===
DeLauro voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

==Personal life==
DeLauro is married to political strategist Stan Greenberg. DeLauro has three children and is a grandmother of five. At age 80, DeLauro got a tattoo, a purple and red rose design, to celebrate her eldest granddaughter&#x27;s 18th birthday. As of 2023, she possibly plans to get more tattoos when her four other grandchildren reach age 18, as well.

DeLauro was treated for ovarian cancer in 1986 . Because the cancer was caught extremely early at stage 1 , she made a full recovery and has been cancer-free for over 30 years. She continues to support biomedical research, including efforts to develop a reliable screening test for ovarian cancer.

She is an honorary board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women. She is a leader in the group Catholic Democrats. She is a close friend of former U.S. president Joe Biden, whom she met when serving as chief of staff to Chris Dodd in the U.S. Senate. She is also credited with being a mentor to his son, Hunter Biden, when he attended Yale Law School.

<text>Richard George Caborn (born 6 October 1943) is a British politician who served as Minister of Sport from 2001 to 2007 and later as the prime minister&#x27;s ambassador for England&#x27;s 2018 FIFA World Cup bid. He previously served as a junior minister in the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions and Department of Trade and Industry. A member of the Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Sheffield Central from 1983 to 2010.

==Early life==
Richard Caborn was born in Sheffield and was educated at the Hurlfield Secondary Modern Boys School until 1958 (now Sheffield Springs Academy) on East Bank Road, Intake in Sheffield; Granville College of Further Education (now Castle College, part of Sheffield College); and Sheffield Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University), where he qualified as an engineer. He began an engineering apprenticeship in 1959 and became a convenor of shop stewards at Firth Brown in 1967 where he worked as a fitter. He was elected as the Vice-President of Sheffield Trades Council between 1968 and 1979. He became a governor of the BBC for three years in 1975. He is a member of the Co-operative Party and of Amicus (formerly AEEU).

==Parliamentary career==
In 1979, he was elected as a Member of the European Parliament for Sheffield, where he remained until 1984. He contested the new parliamentary seat of Sheffield Central at the 1983 general election, following the decision to retire of the Labour MP for Sheffield Park and former Cabinet member Fred Mulley, and was elected somewhat easily with a majority of 16,790, and remained the MP there until 2010.

Caborn joined the frontbench under Neil Kinnock in 1988 when he became an opposition spokesman on Trade and Industry, becoming a spokesman of Regional Affairs in 1990. After the 1992 general election he became the chairman of the Trade and Industry Select committee where he served until 1995 when he became an opposition spokesman on the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department. Following Labour&#x27;s return to power at the 1997 general election, he entered the government of Tony Blair as the Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, in which role he was closely involved in establishing the English Regional Development Agencies. He was also a strong supporter of English regional government, but after negative responses from referendums in the north of England in 2004 this was dropped by government. He then moved with the same position at the Department of Trade and Industry in 1999. He became a Member of the Privy Council in 1999, and from the 2001 general election until 2007 he served as the Minister of Sport. In relation to the Wembley Stadium rebuilding project, he announced in October 2005: &quot;They say the Cup Final will be there, barring six feet of snow or something like that&quot;.

Caborn was seen as a close ally of John Prescott, running his campaigns for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party in 1992 (whilst supporting Bryan Gould for leader). He also ran Prescott&#x27;s campaign for both deputy and leader in 1994. He is a former Bennite, and was very active on South Africa issues, being pro-Mandela and anti-apartheid; he ran concerts in support of the African National Congress. He was an active supporter of Arthur Scargill during the 1984–1985 miners&#x27; strike.

In March 2003, Caborn supported Tony Blair in voting for the controversial Iraq War. On 30 December 2005, Caborn publicly announced his support for capped wages in British football.

On 28 June 2007, it was announced he would step down as Minister for Sport to become the prime minister&#x27;s ambassador for Britain&#x27;s unsuccessful 2018 FIFA World Cup bid. In this role, he lobbied FIFA, oversaw the appointment of the bid&#x27;s senior team and liaised between ministers and the Football Association.

Caborn announced on 13 September 2007 that he would stand down at the next general election.

Caborn is a director of Nuclear Management Partners, which manages the Sellafield nuclear complex, a consultant to AMEC, a construction firm in the nuclear industry, and also a consultant to the Fitness Industry Association.

In March 2010, Caborn faced accusations in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that he accepted money in exchange for influencing policy, implicating him in the &quot;Lobbygate&quot; affair. On 9 December 2010, Stephen Byers, Geoff Hoon and himself were banned from Parliament. The Standards and Privileges Committee banned him for six months whilst Byers received two years and Hoon five years.

==Caborn principles==
The Caborn principles, a list of criteria used by a Secretary of State in deciding whether to use their power to call in a planning application, are named after Caborn, who as Planning Minister first established them in June 1999.

<text>Cisalpine Gaul (, also called &quot;Gallia Citerior&quot; or &quot;Gallia Togata&quot;) was the name given, especially during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, to a region of land inhabited by Celts (Gauls), corresponding to what is now most of northern Italy.

After its conquest by the Roman Republic in the 200s BC, it was considered geographically part of Roman Italy but remained administratively separated until 42 BC. It was a Roman province from c. 81 BC until 42 BC, when it was &quot;de jure&quot; merged into Roman Italy as already planned by Julius Caesar. 

Cisalpine means &quot;on this side of the Alps&quot; (from the perspective of the Romans), as opposed to Transalpine Gaul (&quot;on the far side of the Alps&quot;).

Gallia Cisalpina was further subdivided into &quot;Gallia Cispadana&quot; and &quot;Gallia Transpadana&quot;, i.e., its portions south and north of the Po River, respectively.

The Roman province of the 1st century BC was bounded on the north and west by the Alps, in the south as far as Placentia by the river Po, and then by the Apennines and the river Rubicon, and in the east by the Adriatic Sea. 

In 49 BC, all inhabitants of Cisalpine Gaul received Roman citizenship, and eventually the province was divided among four of the eleven regions of Italy: &quot;Regio VIII Gallia Cispadana&quot;, &quot;Regio IX Liguria&quot;, &quot;Regio X Venetia et Histria&quot;, and &quot;Regio XI Gallia Transpadana&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===

The Canegrate culture (13th century BC) may represent the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). They brought a new funerary practice—cremation—which supplanted inhumation. It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age (16th–15th century BC), when, regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, North Western Italy appears to have been closely linked to the western groups of the Tumulus culture (Central Europe, 1600 BC – 1200 BC). The bearers of the Canegrate culture maintained its homogeneity for only a century, after which it melded with the Ligurian aboriginal populations and with this union gave rise to a new phase called the Golasecca culture, which is nowadays identified with the Celtic Lepontii. According to Livy (v. 34), the Bituriges, Arverni, Senones, Aedui, Ambarri, Carnutes, and Aulerci led by Bellovesus, arrived in northern Italy during the reign of Tarquinius Priscus (7th–6th century BC) and occupied the area between Milan and Cremona. Milan (&quot;Mediolanum&quot;) itself was presumably founded by Gauls in the early 6th century BC; its name has a Celtic etymology: &quot;[city] in the middle of the [Padanic] plain&quot;. Polybius, in the 2nd century BC, wrote that the Celts in northern Italy co-existed with Etruscan nations during a period before the Sack of Rome in 390 BC.

Ligures lived on the Northern Mediterranean Coast straddling southeast French and North-west Italian coasts, including parts of Tuscany, Elba island and Corsica. Ligurian tribes were also present in Latium (see Rutuli) and in Samnium. According to Plutarch they called themselves &quot;Ambrones&quot;, which suggests a possible relationship between them and the Ambrones of northern Europe. Little is known of the Ligurian language. Only place names and personal names remain. It appears to be an Indo-European language with both Italic and particularly strong Celtic affinities. Because of the strong Celtic influences on their language and culture, they were known in antiquity as Celto-Ligurians (in Greek , Keltolígues). Modern linguists, like Xavier Delamarre, argue that Ligurian was a Celtic language with some similarity to Gaulish. The Ligurian-Celtic question is also discussed by Barruol (1999). Ancient Ligurian is listed either as Celtic (epigraphic) or Para-Celtic (onomastic).

The Veneti were Indo-European people who inhabited north-eastern Italy, in an area corresponding to the modern-day region of the Veneto, Friuli, and Trentino. By the 4th century BC the Veneti had been so Celticized that Polybius wrote that the Veneti of the 2nd century BC were identical to the Gauls except for their language. The Greek historian Strabo (64 BC–AD 24), on the other hand, conjectured that the Adriatic Veneti were descended from Celts, who in turn were related to a later Celtic tribe of the same name whose members lived on the Armorican coast and fought against Julius Caesar. He further suggested that the identification of the Adriatic Veneti with the Paphlagonian Enetoi led by Antenor — which he attributes to Sophocles (496–406 BC) — had been a mistake caused by the similarity of the names.

===Gallic expansion and Roman conquest===

In 391 BC, Celts &quot;who had their homes beyond the Alps, streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine mountains and the Alps&quot; according to Diodorus Siculus. The Roman army was routed in the battle of Allia, and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.

The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War ending in 290 BC sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe. At the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.

In the Second Punic War, the Boii and Insubres allied themselves with the Carthaginians, laying siege to Mutina (Modena). In response, Rome sent an expedition led by L. Manlius Vulso. Vulso&#x27;s army was ambushed twice, and the Senate sent Scipio with an additional force to provide support. These were the Roman forces encountered by Hannibal after he crossed the Alps. The Romans were defeated in the Battle of the Ticinus, leading all the Gauls except for the Cenomani to join the insurgency. Rome then sent the army of Tiberius Sempronius Longus who engaged Hannibal in the Battle of the Trebia, also resulting in a Roman defeat, forcing Rome to temporarily abandon Gallia Cisalpina altogether, returning only after the defeat of Carthage in 202 BC.

Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica completed the conquest of the Boii in 191 BC, although the Ligurians were only finally subdued when the Apuani were defeated by Marcus Claudius Marcellus in 155 BC.

===Roman province===

Sometimes referred to as &quot;Gallia Citerior&quot; (&quot;Hither Gaul&quot;), &quot;Provincia Ariminum&quot;, or &quot;Gallia Togata&quot; (&quot;Toga-wearing Gaul&quot;, indicating the region&#x27;s early Romanization). &quot;Gallia Transpadana&quot; denoted that part of Cisalpine Gaul between the Padus (now the Po River) and the Alps, while &quot;Gallia Cispadana&quot; was the part to the south of the river.

Probably officially established around 81 BC, the province was governed from Mutina (modern-day Modena), where, in 73 BC, forces under Spartacus defeated the legion of Gaius Cassius Longinus, the provincial governor.

In 49 BC, with the Lex Roscia, Julius Caesar granted to the populations of the province full Roman citizenship.

The Rubicon River marked its southern boundary with Italia proper. By crossing this river in 49 BC with his loyal XIII Legion, returning from the conquest of Gaul, Julius Caesar precipitated the civil war within the Roman Republic which led, eventually, to the establishment of the Roman Empire. To this day the term &quot;crossing the Rubicon&quot; means, figuratively, &quot;reaching the point of no return&quot;.

The province was merged into Italia about 42 BC, as part of Octavian&#x27;s &quot;Italicization&quot; program during the Second Triumvirate. The dissolution of the &quot;provincia&quot; required a new governing law or &quot;lex&quot;, although its contemporary title is unknown. The parts of it inscribed on a bronze tablet preserved in the museum at Parma are entirely concerned with arranging the judiciary: the law appoints two &quot;viri&quot; and four &quot;viri juri dicundo&quot; and also mentions a Prefect of Mutina.

Virgil, Catullus and Livy, three famous sons of the province, were born in &quot;Gallia Cisalpina&quot;.

==Archaeology==

===Canegrate culture===
The Canegrate culture reflects a late Bronze Age to early Iron Age culture in the Pianura Padana. These areas are now known as western Lombardy, eastern Piedmont and Canton Ticino.

The Canegrate culture testifies to the arrival of Urnfield migratory wave of populations from the northwest part of the Alps that, crossing the alpine passes, had infiltrated and settled in the western Po area between Lake Maggiore and the Lake of Como (see Scamozzina culture). They were bearers of a new funerary practice, which supplanted the old culture of inhumation and instead introduced cremation.

The population of Canegrate maintained its own homogeneity for a limited period, approximately a century, after which it blended with the Ligurian aboriginal populations to create the new Golasecca culture.

===Golasecca culture===

The Culture of Golasecca (9th to 4th centuries BC) spread between the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age in the areas of northwestern Lombardy and Piedmont, and the Canton Ticino. At the end of the prehistoric period, this was an area where travellers frequently stopped and had contact with the Hallstatt culture to the west, the Urnfield culture to the north and with the Villanova culture to the south. The Golasecca culture was initially concentrated in the foothills area south of the Alps. It later spread throughout the lakes area, and established many settlements representing this original culture. The oldest remains found thus far can be dated from the 9th century BC.

==Language==

There is some debate whether the Lepontic language should be considered as a Gaulish dialect or an independent branch within Continental Celtic. Apart from Lepontic, the &quot;Cisalpine Gaulish language&quot; proper would be the Gaulish language as spoken by the Gauls invading northern Italy in the 4th century BC. This is a dialect of the larger Gaulish language, with some known phonetic features distinguishing it from Transalpine dialects, such as &quot;-nn-&quot; replacing &quot;-nd-&quot; and &quot;s(s)&quot; replacing &quot;-χs-&quot;.

<text>Givenchy-en-Gohelle (, ; ) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France. The village was destroyed during World War I but was rebuilt after the war.

==Geography==
Givenchy-en-Gohelle is a large farming village situated north of Arras, at the junction of the D51 and the D55 roads. Its neighboring communes are Souchez to the west, Angres to the northwest, Liévin to the north, Avion to the east and Vimy to the southeast.

The &quot;Bois de Givenchy&quot; or Givenchy Forest, covers much of the commune on its northern side. To further the agricultural range of products, the commune of Givenchy-en-Gohelle have planted grapes (chardonnay and pinot gris). The first grape harvest took place in 2000.

==First World War==
During the First World War, Givenchy-en-Gohelle was on the front line between German and Allied forces during the battles of Arras and was severely damaged, particularly during the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917. For much of the First World War, the village also was the site of sustained underground fighting between German and British tunneling units. Givenchy-en-Gohelle was taken by the 2nd Canadian Division on 13 April 1917. Over 150 war casualties (1914–1918) are commemorated at the Canadian cemetery here and 109 from the Battle of Vimy Ridge are buried here.

The centennial commemoration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge was held at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial near the village on 9 April 2017. Estimates before the event indicated that up to 30,000 would attend.

By early April 2017, the village had been decorated with 500 Canadian flags.

<doc id="410184" wikidata="Q6474567" url="?curid=410184" title="Lakas–CMD (1991)">
<text>Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats (), abbreviated as Lakas–CMD and popularly known as Lakas, was a political party in the Philippines. Its ideology and that of its successor is heavily influenced by Christian and Islamic democracy. The party&#x27;s influence on Philippine society is very strong, especially after the People Power Revolution, which has led the country to elect two presidents from the party, namely Fidel V. Ramos, a United Methodist, and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a Roman Catholic.

In May 2009, Lakas–CMD merged with Arroyo&#x27;s Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino, thereby being known as Lakas Kampi CMD, a completely new entity. In May 2012, Lakas Kampi CMD renamed itself again as Lakas–CMD after the separation of KAMPI.

==History==

=== Formation ===
In November 1991, former National Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos joined the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) in order to gain its support for his 1992 presidential bid. The LDP National Convention was held to nominate the party&#x27;s presidential and vice presidential candidates for 1992. After losing the presidential nomination to Mitra, Ramos bolted the LDP and organized the United People Power Movement (UPPM) with then Pangasinan Representative Jose de Venecia Jr. The new organization was officially named Lakas ng Tao (or Lakas ng EDSA) and formally launched on January 3, 1992, at the Club Filipino in Greenhills, San Juan.

Upon de Venecia&#x27;s initiative, Ramos merged Lakas ng Tao with the National Union of Christian Democrats (NUCD), a cluster of the defunct Progressive Party, to form Lakas–National Union of Christian Democrats (Lakas–NUCD). Some of LDP members were raided by Ramos and De Venecia to join their newly-formed party, which LDP co-founder Peping Cojuangco criticized.

=== 1992 elections: Ramos administration ===
Ramos won the presidential election, defeating former Agrarian Reform Secretary Miriam Defensor Santiago of the People&#x27;s Reform Party, Mitra and four other presidential candidates. On the other hand, Osmeña lost the vice presidential race to Senator Joseph Estrada of the Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition (NPC). But since he got a low plurality in the election, de Venecia created the &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot; and converged Lakas, LDP, NPC and other national parties. In 1995, Lakas–NUCD formed an alliance with LDP for the 1995 legislative elections. This coalition, called the Lakas-Laban Coalition, won a majority in both houses of Congress.
Ramos invited Cebu Governor Lito Osmeña to serve as his running-mate. 
===1998 elections===
In 1997, Lakas–NUCD was joined by the United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (UMDP) of former Ambassador Sanchez Ali, thereby changing the party&#x27;s name to Lakas–National Union of Christian Democrats–United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (Lakas–NUCD–UMDP). In November that year, Lakas held a national convention to select its nominees for the 1998 national elections. The long list of contenders for the presidential nomination had been abridged into a close fight between Ramos&#x27; two leading political lieutenants, House Speaker de Venecia and former Defense Secretary Renato de Villa. After rounds of secret balloting, de Venecia won the nomination and was officially proclaimed as the Lakas presidential nominee for the 1998 election.After losing the nomination, de Villa bolted Lakas and formed the Partido para sa Demokratikong Reporma with Pangasinan Governor Oscar Orbos as his running mate for vice president. Lito Osmeña, who also lost the presidential nomination, launched his presidential bid under the Probinsya Muna Development Initiative (PROMDI) with Ismael Sueno as his running mate.

Meanwhile, Lakas nominated then Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as its candidate for vice president. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino (KAMPI).

De Venecia lost the presidential election to Vice President Joseph Estrada of Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino by a significant plurality. Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner as Estrada, defeating Estrada&#x27;s running mate, Senator Edgardo Angara. Arroyo emerged victorious in the vice presidential race while KAMPI was in hiatus.

===2004: Arroyo administration===
==== Renaming ====
In early 2004, the party&#x27;s name was changed into the current Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas–CMD). However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name was now referred to as &quot;Lakas ng EDSA&quot; (&quot;The Strength of EDSA&quot;) from the original &quot;Lakas ng Tao&quot; (&quot;People Power&quot;). This was also the name that the party used when it participated in the 2004 Philippine general election as the leading member of the K4 Coalition. 

==== Presidential nomination ====
By 2003, Arroyo stated that she will not run for a full term. Because of her statements, Senators Jun Magsaysay, Dr. Juan Flavier, and Loren Legarda declared their intention to get the Lakas presidential nomination. But only Magsaysay and Flavier are those party members who is contenders are willing to give way if Arroyo retracted her statement and run for presidential elections. Flavier also said that if Legarda campaign for presidential nomination, he will withdraw. Legarda that time finds her potential running mate with the likes of Raul Roco, and President Arroyo.

Legarda and Vice President Tito Guingona later leave Lakas to join the opposition, with Legarda as the vice presidential candidate.

==== Gloria Arroyo&#x27;s campaign ====

President Arroyo was the K4 candidate for president in the 2004 Philippine presidential election, eventually winning over actor Fernando Poe Jr. and Senator Panfilo Lacson.

After Poe&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to the presidency, his supporters viewed the election results as fraudulent and came under legal protest by Poe and his running-mate, former Senator Loren Legarda. The poll protests were later thrown out by the Supreme Court acting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET).

At the onset of 2006, Lakas–CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President Fidel V. Ramos. Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap the 2007 midterm elections (&quot;no-el&quot;) and calls for her to step down in time for the elections. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting in January 2006 to discuss these matters.

There are no official results available of the 2007 elections released by Lakas–CMD but according to the House of Representatives, the party held 79 out of 235 seats.

On January 16, 2008, Lakas–CMD spokesman and legal counsel Raul Lambino stated that Lakas officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010. Except for Parañaque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified. However, Lambino named incumbent Senators Bong Revilla and Lito Lapid, former senator Ralph Recto and former Congressman Prospero Pichay as among those considered.

De Venecia&#x27;s resignation

Jose de Venecia resigned his post as president of Lakas on March 10, 2008, and rejected the proposition of Ramos to give him the title of chairman emeritus. House Speaker Prospero Nograles and former House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. were sworn as party president and vice president for Metro Manila affairs on the same day, respectively.

====Merger with KAMPI====
On June 18, 2008, President Gloria Arroyo confirmed the historical merger of the Lakas–CMD and the Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI) parties. Both parties adopted the “equity of the incumbent” principle, as the merger will account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid Arroyo&#x27;s prediction of victory in the 2010 elections. Nograles and KAMPI Chairman Ronaldo Puno signed the covenant at the regional caucus held in Davao City. Ramos, the party chairman-emeritus, announced on February 6, 2008, that Lakas–CMD would be the surviving entity after its merger with KAMPI.

On August 9, 2009, de Venecia and Ramos led fifty members from the Lakas–Kampi–CMD in objecting to its merger with KAMPI. The faction elected de Venecia as president and Ramos as chairman emeritus. However, Ramos later refused the offer of being named in the interim party organization. De Venecia has filed a resolution at the Commission on Elections to declare the merger &quot;null and void&quot;. However, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the legality of the merger, citing the failure of de Venecia “to sufficiently show that any grave abuse of discretion was committed by the Commission on Elections in rendering the challenged resolution.”

The logo is still used by its merger .

==Ideology==
Lakas-CMD has always focused on economic growth and development, stronger ties with the United States, creation of jobs, and strong cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. It is known for its advocacy of a shift from the present presidential system to a parliamentary form of government through constitutional amendments and through establishing peace talks with Muslim separatists and communist rebels. The party democracy is distinct in its ecumenical inclusion of Muslim leaders in its political alliance.

<doc id="410187" wikidata="Q1086964" url="?curid=410187" title="Chris Shays">
<text>Christopher Hunter Shays (born October 18, 1945) is an American politician. He previously served in the United States House of Representatives as representative of the 4th District of Connecticut from 1987 to 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Shays was the only Republican congressman from New England elected to the 110th United States Congress in the 2006 midterm elections. His loss to Jim Himes in the 2008 election made New England&#x27;s House delegation entirely Democratic in the 111th Congress. He was the most senior member of the House of Representatives to be defeated in the 2008 election.

In 2009, Shays was appointed to co-chair the Commission on Wartime Contracting. The commission is an independent, bipartisan legislative commission established to study wartime contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Created in Section 841 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, this eight-member commission is mandated by Congress to study federal agency contracting for the reconstruction, logistical support of coalition forces, and the performance of security functions in Iraq and Afghanistan. He co-chaired the government watchdog commission that identified and raised alarm over $60 billion of waste, fraud, and abuse in wartime contingency contracting and presented to Congress reforms to address this wasteful spending.

Shays was a candidate for the 2012 Republican U.S. Senate nomination to replace retiring Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman.
However, he lost the August 14 primary to Linda McMahon. To date, he is the last Republican to have represented Connecticut in Congress.

==Background==

Shays was born in Stamford, Connecticut, the son of Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; (née Oliver) and Thurston Crane Shays. His maternal grandmother was born in Scotland. He grew up in Darien, and graduated from Darien High School in 1964. He attended the Christian Science Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, and received both a Master of Business Administration and a Master of Public Administration from New York University. He lives in the Black Rock section of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Shays has always remained a Christian Scientist—a system of thought and practice derived from the writings of Mary Baker Eddy and the Bible—throughout his life.

Shays married Betsi DeRaismes in 1968. They served together in the Peace Corps in Fiji from 1968 to 1970. They have one daughter.

===Connecticut General Assembly===
At the age of 29, Shays was first elected to the Connecticut House where he served from 1975 to 1987. He served simultaneously as the ranking member of both the Appropriations Committee and the Committee on Finance, Revenue, and Bonding. He also served as a member of the Judiciary Committee. He served six days in jail on a contempt charge when he was a member of the Connecticut Legislature protesting judicial corruption.

===Member of the United States Congress===
In 1987, Shays won a special election to fill the vacant seat of the late Congressman Stewart McKinney. He represented the 4th congressional district (southwestern Connecticut) until losing to Jim Himes in 2008.

During his 21 years in Congress, Christopher served on the Government Reform, Financial Services, Budget and Homeland Security committees and was the first congressman to enter Iraq after the war.

===Police incident===
In 2007, during an incident at the Capitol, a staff member under Shays&#x27; supervision attempted to bring a family through a restricted-access door. When a United States Capitol Police officer intervened and prevented their entry, Shays engaged in a heated exchange with the officer. He raised his voice, using profanities, and attempted to inspect the officer&#x27;s badge for identification. Following the incident, Shays publicly acknowledged his regret for his behavior and accepted full responsibility for his actions.

==Voting record==
Shays is a moderate Republican. From 1990 onward, Shays voted with the Republican majority 76.8% of the time, voted with the Democratic majority 57.9% of the time and missed 2.5% of the votes. A &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; analysis of Shays&#x27; voting record found that he is a moderate, having voted historically more often with liberals than with conservatives, although it noted he voted with Congressional Republicans 80% of the time in 2002.

Shays is labeled by his supporters as a &quot;maverick&quot; and &quot;independent thinker&quot;, while conservative detractors regard him as a RINO (&quot;Republican In Name Only&quot;). He and Marty Meehan were the lead sponsors of the House version of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2002. Shays is pro-choice on abortion but voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Shays was endorsed by the Brady Campaign for his support for gun control and was one of only six Republicans to vote against banning lawsuits against gun manufacturers and distributors in 2005. Despite having voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, Shays voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment in both 2004 and 2006 that would constitutionally ban same-sex marriage, and co-sponsored a bill to overturn the military&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy that prohibited LGBT troops from serving openly. He was one of the few Republicans to oppose amending the Constitution to ban flag-burning. In 1999 he was one of 20 Republicans to vote against an ultimately failed bill to ban physician-assisted suicide. Shays has long been known for environmental regulations, and was endorsed in the past by the League of Conservation Voters. He also advocates humane treatment of animals and ending discrimination in the workplace. Shays was also one of only four Republicans to vote against all four articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton.

In April 2005, he broke with most of his party over House Majority Leader Tom DeLay&#x27;s alleged ethics violations. January 2011, DeLay was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to three years in prison but was freed on bail while appealing his conviction. His comments in 2005 made Shays the first Republican to say DeLay should step down from the Majority Leader post. He fought to maintain the Republican Party rule that requires an indicted leader to step down — the rule that ultimately resulted in Tom DeLay&#x27;s resignation. Shays stated that he should resign, saying, &quot;Tom&#x27;s conduct is hurting the Republican Party, is hurting this Republican majority and it is hurting any Republican who is up for re-election.&quot;

Shays is a member of or supported by the Republican Main Street Partnership, The Republican Majority for Choice, Republicans for Environmental Protection, It&#x27;s My Party Too, and the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.

===Views on Iraq===
Shays voted in favor of the 2003 congressional resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. In 2003, he was the first U.S. Congressman to visit Iraq after the outbreak of war and he has traveled to Iraq 21 times overall, more than any other U.S. legislator.

From 2003 until August 24, 2006, Shays was a &quot;stalwart supporter&quot; of the War in Iraq, and of a continued U.S. military presence there. Shays has faced a continued political challenge to his views in a district where recent polls show a solid majority of voters disapprove of the 2003 US decision to invade Iraq.
On April 10, 2003, Shays told the &quot;Connecticut Post&quot; that &quot;&#x27;The successes to date are extraordinary. The war plan has been nearly flawless. Now we need to make sure the peace plan rises to the same level,&#x27; Shays said. &#x27;If we are able to help them form a government quickly, we will be viewed as liberators. If we are there too long, we will be viewed basically as conquerors.&#x27;&quot; On August 19, 2004, Shays told reporters, &quot;We&#x27;re on the right track now.&quot; On June 24, 2005, Shays said &quot;We&#x27;ve seen amazing progress [in Iraq].&quot; On July 27, 2005, Shays said on a local radio program that he was optimistic about the future of Iraq, and that he opposed any timetable for troop withdrawal. On June 11, 2006 Shays told the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; that his position on the war was a matter of principle and he was not going to stop talking about it.

On October 11, 2006, at a debate Shays sparked outrage from critics with comments about the &quot;Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse&quot; scandal. &quot;Now I&#x27;ve seen what happened in Abu Ghraib, and Abu Ghraib was not torture. It was outrageous, outrageous involvement of National Guard troops from [Maryland] who were involved in a sex ring and they took pictures of soldiers who were naked, and they did other things that were just outrageous. But it wasn&#x27;t torture.&quot;

Upon returning from an August 2006 Iraq trip, Shays became the first Congressional Republican to call for a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. Shays said he was still a supporter of the war, but supported a timetable in order to &quot;encourage some political will on the part of Iraqis&quot;.

Shays has staunchly disputed media claims that he has flip-flopped his position on Iraq. &quot;I am not distancing myself from the President,&quot; he told the Los Angeles Times on August 25, 2006. That same day, he told other reporters, &quot;I totally support the war,&quot; and Shays supported the President&#x27;s decision to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq on February 17, 2007, when he voted in favor of the surge.

On February 16, 2007, Shays voted against H. Con. Res. 63 (which disapproved of increasing troop levels in Iraq), claiming that &quot;The resolution sends the wrong message to the President, to our troops, and to our enemies&quot; 
On July 13, 2007 Shays called on Congress to approve withdrawing virtually all American troops from Iraq by December 2008. &quot;I believe we need a timeline. I believe the president&#x27;s wrong,&quot; said Shays. Shays&#x27; latest plan marks the first time he has specified dates. On April 13, 2008, Shays defended President Bush&#x27;s Iraq policy to a town meeting in his home district, telling them, &quot;I support the President on Iraq.&quot;

==Elections==
Shays served as a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1975 to 1987, representing part of Stamford (he has since moved to Bridgeport). Just a few months after starting his seventh term in the state house, Shays entered a special election for the 4th District after 16-year incumbent Stewart McKinney died of AIDS, and won with 57 percent of the vote. He won the seat in his own right in 1988 and was reelected nine times.

From 1988 to 2002, Shays was reelected fairly handily, never dropping below 57 percent of the vote even as the 4th turned more Democratic at the national level. The district, once a classic &quot;Yankee Republican&quot; district, swung heavily Democratic along with the rest of Connecticut from the early 1990s onward; the last Republican presidential candidate to carry it was George H. W. Bush in 1988. However, in 2004, Westport First Selectwoman Diane Farrell held him to only 52 percent of the vote, his closest contest in two decades.

===2006 election===
In 2006, Shays was in &quot;the fight of his political life&quot;, facing a rematch with Farrell. According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;With money pouring in from the district and from national groups (Farrell expects to raise close to $3 million, Shays a bit less) and unregulated political interest groups targeting Shays with automated calls and negative telemarketing designed as polls, this one already has the odor of ugly.&quot; According to the &quot;U.S. News&quot; report, Farrell says that, in 2002, Shays voted in support of Bush&#x27;s post-9/11 agenda 80% of the time, but other analyses of his voting record revealed that historically he voted more often with liberals.

Despite the strong challenge from Farrell, Shays was re-elected to Congress in the 2006 election by a slim margin of 6,645 votes (3%). Shays lost Bridgeport, Stamford, Norwalk, Westport, and Weston to Farrell, but her margin in those communities was insufficient to overcome Shays&#x27; lead in the more Republican towns in the district.

After the defeats of Nancy Johnson and Rob Simmons, Shays was the only Republican member of the Connecticut congressional delegation, and the only Republican House member from New England.

===2008 election===

In the 2008 election, Shays faced Democratic nominee Jim Himes, an affordable housing executive and businessman; Libertarian nominee M.A. Carrano, an experimental philosopher, systems consultant and author; and Green Party nominee Richard Duffee. Shays was defeated by Himes 51% to 48%. Himes was likely assisted by Barack Obama&#x27;s landslide victory in the 4th; Obama carried the district with 60% of the vote, one of the largest margins for a Republican-held district. Shays&#x27; defeat resulted in there being no Republicans representing New England in the House for the first time since the GOP&#x27;s inception in the 1850s.

Shays carried 14 of the 17 towns in his district. However, Himes took the three largest towns—Bridgeport, Norwalk and Stamford. Ultimately, Shays could not overcome a landslide loss in Bridgeport, the largest city in the district, where he won only 19% of the vote.

==2012 U.S. Senate candidacy==

Shays officially entered the 2012 U.S. Senate race on August 22, 2011, to replace retiring senator Joe Lieberman. At the Connecticut State Republican Convention, Linda McMahon earned the endorsement of the state Republican Party by a delegate vote of 658 to 351 over Shays. The two were the only candidates to qualify for the primary, which would take place on August 14, 2012.

A series of independent polls had shown Shays defeating or in dead heat with the top Democratic contenders in the general election, while those same polls show McMahon losing handily to each of the top Democratic contenders. The Shays campaign asserted the former Congressman showed more electability than McMahon, due to her loss in an open Senate seat contest in 2010 by a large margin despite spending $50 million of her own money, also citing her high unfavorable numbers among state voters, and the weak fundraising numbers of the McMahon campaign.

Despite support among Independents and even some Democrats, Shays faced a significant obstacles in the primary trailing in both campaign funds and poll results. Outspent by more than $60 million, Shays was defeated by a three-to-one margin in the primary. She faced Democratic Representative Chris Murphy in the general election and lost, marking her second consecutive defeat in two years.

==Subsequent career==

In 2013, Shays was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. He was mentioned as a potential candidate for Governor of Connecticut in 2014, but ultimately did not enter that race.

In the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Shays originally endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich. After Donald Trump won the Republican primary, he announced in August 2016 that he would vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election.

He served as a Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics in Spring 2017.

He endorsed Joe Biden, for President of the United States of America in the 2020 United States elections.

In 2020, Shays, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

In August 2024, he joined the &quot;Republicans for Harris&quot; group along with other former Republican officials in opposition to Trump.

<text>Rosanna Bella Victoria Eriksdotter Munter (born 26 September 1987) is an actress and recording artist from Sweden. She is best known as a member of the Swedish girl group Play, and she was in a collaborative project with White Lies bassist Charles Cave titled K.I.D.S.

She quit the music industry as a recording artist in 2015, and works A&amp;R at Universal Music in Stockholm as of 2022. She founded and runs a music management company called Logic &amp; Heart.

==Career==

===Early career===
Munter&#x27;s first introduction to stardom, prior to joining Play, was at the age of 12, with the supporting role of Petra in the successful Swedish film &quot;Eva &amp; Adam – Fyra Födelsedagar och ett Fiasko&quot;, directed by Catti Edfeldt. The film was based on the popular Scandinavian sitcom &quot;Eva &amp; Adam&quot;.

===2000–2005: Play===
Munter was one of hundreds of teen girls who auditioned for a spot in Play, an all-girl pop group formed by Laila Bagge, Anders Bagge, and Andreas Karlsson in Stockholm, Sweden. While rehearsing at Laila&#x27;s house, Tommy Mottola (who was speaking with Laila on the phone) overheard the group in the background. He was so impressed with their sound that he flew them to Los Angeles a few days later. After performing for label executives, Play was signed to Columbia Records.

In December 2001, Play released their first album entitled &quot;Us Against the World&quot;. The album peaked at number 74 on the Billboard Top 200 and their debut single, &quot;Us Against the World&quot;, found success on Radio Disney and Nickelodeon. Play also made a cameo appearance in Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen&#x27;s movie Holiday in the Sun performing &quot;Us Against the World&quot;. To promote the album, the group toured nearly non-stop for a year, opening for Destiny&#x27;s Child, Aaron Carter, and touring with Chris Trousdale and A-Teens. Their song &quot;Disco Hippie&quot; was featured on a commercial for Build-A-Bear Workshop. In 2002, they recorded a song and later a filmed a video with Lil&#x27; Fizz, formerly of B2K, for the Master of Disguise film.

In 2003, the group released their second album titled &quot;Replay&quot; which debuted at number 67 on the Billboard Top 200, and remained on the chart for several weeks. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;I Must Not Chase The Boys&quot; reached Number 10 on MTV&#x27;s TRL. The group later went on to perform &quot;I Must Not Chase The Boys&quot; on Live with Regis and Kelly. After nearly a year hiatus, it was officially reported in October 2003 that Faye had left the group, and was replaced by Janet Leon, a 13-year-old singer from Gothenburg.

The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, was released in 2004. The group partnered with clothing brand Limited Too and became the official spokes models. Clothing and jewellery from the line was featured in the Swedish version of their music video for their single &quot;everGirl&quot;. Limited Too used the song in commercials, and Play later toured various Limited Too stores across the U.S.. The following year, they released &quot;Play Around the Christmas Tree&quot;, and shortly after, a compilation of their singles was released on an album titled &quot;Girl&#x27;s Mind&quot;. In late 2005, Play released an official statement on their website, stating that the girl&#x27;s were going their &quot;separate ways&quot;.

While in Play, Rosie generally sang Soprano Harmonies and had occasional solos.

===2005–2010: solo career===
After Play disbanded, Munter dabbled in modeling in New York City before moving back to Sweden. She enrolled in College and majored in Music.

In 2007 Munter partnered with Swedish artist and producer Kocky. She lent her vocals to Kocky&#x27;s debut album &quot;Kingdom Came&quot; (released 2007). She is featured in three songs off the album: &quot;My Grandma,&quot; &quot;Be Part of It All,&quot; and &quot;Tricks&quot; – the latter being released as a single. The single &quot;Tricks&quot; was released 10 September 2007 and Munter also appeared in the song&#x27;s music video.

Munter was once again featured heavily on Kocky&#x27;s second album, &quot;Stadium Status&quot;, singing on four of the ten tracks. Featured on &quot;We&#x27;re Back,&quot; &quot;4-ever Juvenile,&quot; and &quot;Oh!&quot; (which she co-wrote with Kocky). To promote the &quot;Stadium Status&quot;, Munter and Kocky performed on various Swedish television programs including the morning news show Nyhetsmorgon.

In 2009 Munter launched an official Myspace page and official website (both of which have been disbanded). She released several demo songs &quot;The First Time,&quot; &quot;Gameboy,&quot; &quot;Heart Attack,&quot; &quot;Tick Tock,&quot; &quot;Under Attack,&quot; and &quot;Flashing Lights.&quot; She posted a homemade music video for her song &quot;Flashing Lights&quot; on her Myspace page. By 2009 Munter was alternating between Stockholm and London pursuing her solo career and songwriting career. Munter signed with EMI Publishing as a songwriter in 2009. EMI Publishing later went on and became Sony/ATV Publishing and Munter continued working close with Sony/ATV for the next 6 years.

In 2010 Munter signed with U.K.-based label Popjustice Hi-Fi which worked out distribution with Virgin Records. On 22 August 2010 Munter released the single (and subsequent music video) &quot;Waterfall&quot; which was produced and co-written by Jim Eliot (Kylie, Ladyhawke). Popjustice Hi-Fi also made available for downloading a B-Side titled &quot;Runaway.&quot; Munter described her sound as &quot;big emotional, chaotic, beautiful pop&quot; while The Guardian has described her debut single &quot;Waterfall&quot; as &quot;gorgeously gloomy sugar-pop&quot; and &quot;Sylvia Plath in American Apparel.&quot;

Throughout 2010 and 2011, Munter formed and performed with a DJ collective called XOXO with her friends Malin Cumzelius, Aino Neneh Jawo, and Caroline Hjelt. Aino and Caroline are best known as Icona Pop. They described themselves as &quot;Best friends playing their favorite songs and whose constant goal is to make you euphoric and sweaty! Patti Smith and Stevie Nicks are household gods!&quot;

===2013–2015: K.I.D.S.===
Along with friend Charles Cave, Munter debuted a new collaborative project at South by Southwest in March 2013. Their performances at SXSW marked the first live performance for the duo. The debut was accompanied by a music video release of their song &quot;Ragged Old Angels.&quot; According to the duo, they have finished recording an album and expect it to be released early 2014.

Nylon has described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;dark-edged electro-pop&quot; while Idolator has described their material as &quot;rich and dramatic, avoiding overwrought theatricality thanks to an expert sense of sonic balance: driving bass grooves and moody, billowy synth textures underpin Rosanna’s sweetly inviting vocal melodies.&quot;

===2015–present===
In early 2015 Munter started a management company called Logic &amp; Heart and has since then worked with artists such as Icona Pop and Lune and producer/songwriter Elias Kapari.

In September 2017 Munter became engaged to her boyfriend and the couple married in August 2018. Munter gave birth to her first child, a daughter in June 2021

<doc id="410189" wikidata="Q2299911" url="?curid=410189" title="Workers' Party (Singapore)">
<text>The Workers&#x27; Party (abbreviation: WP) is a major social democratic political party in Singapore and one of the three contemporary political parties represented in Parliament, alongside the governing People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) and the other opposition Progress Singapore Party (PSP). The WP sits on the centre-left of the political spectrum and is currently the largest and oldest opposition party in Parliament, having contested every parliamentary election since 1959 against the dominant PAP. Since the 2011 general election, the WP has been the only political party, other than the PAP, with elected Members of Parliament (MPs).

The WP was founded in 1965 by David Marshall, having previously led the more left-wing Labour Front (LF) to victory in 1955, forming a minority government and becoming the first Chief Minister of Singapore. After the British initially rejected his proposal for home rule, he resigned as leader of the LF and from his seat in 1957. After creating the WP, Marshall returned as its first representative in the Legislative Assembly as a Member for Anson in 1961, before resigning in 1963 after disagreements with some members of the party. The party would thereafter decline in prominence during the 1960s and 1970s before its re-emergence in 1981, when party leader J. B. Jeyaretnam became the first opposition MP to be elected since Singapore&#x27;s independence, having defeated the PAP&#x27;s candidate at a by-election in Anson. Jeyaretnam was re-elected in 1984, but subsequently lost his seat in 1986 following a conviction for falsely accounting the party&#x27;s funds, a conviction which he claimed was politically motivated. Former members of the WP also include former Law Society President Francis Seow as well as socialist activist Lee Siew Choh.

Since 1991, the party&#x27;s safe seat has been the constituency of Hougang, which was represented by Low Thia Khiang for two decades. The popularity of the party in Hougang has been attributed to the area&#x27;s Teochew heritage and Low&#x27;s personal affability. Low moved to the constituency of Aljunied in 2011, where he led the first team from an opposition party to win a group representation constituency (GRC). In 2020, the WP become the first opposition party to win multiple GRCs in a single general election. Positioning itself as a &quot;check-and-balance&quot; in Parliament, it supports a progressive approach to civic nationalism, reducing the voting age from 21 to 18, establishing a universal minimum wage, and providing more flexibility in regard to the Central Provident Fund. In recent years, members of the WP have worn light blue uniforms during political campaigns to represent the party&#x27;s support for blue-collar workers.

==History==
=== 1956-1965: Pre-independence and beginnings ===

In 1956, Singapore&#x27;s first Chief Minister, David Saul Marshall, resigned his leadership post for Labour Front (the largest party in the assembly at the time) following the failure of the Merdeka Talks that had sought self-governance for Singapore. Marshall remained as the party&#x27;s backbencher in the Legislative Assembly until his resignation in 1957. On 3 November that year, Marshall went on to found the Workers&#x27; Party.

Following the adoption of the Rendel and McNeice Commission recommendations, the six wards in the city area consisting of 18 elected seats was carved into 32. In 1957, the pro-communists backed two new entrants, the Workers&#x27; Party and the People&#x27;s Action Party, which later went on to become the long-running governing party in Singapore. Their electoral debut was mostly a success as the party elected four members (out of the five contested) to the City Council; however, in 1958, Kallang ward incumbent Chang Yuen Tong resigned, and subsequently lost their seat to PAP as a result of their by-election defeat.

The party&#x27;s first Legislative election in 1959 did not see success unlike the 1957 City Election, as Marshall failed to retake his seat from 1955 to 1957, Cairnhill constituency; it was won by former Chief Minister and Singapore People&#x27;s Alliance leader Lim Yew Hock, and the WP did not win any of the three contested seats. That same election also saw PAP became the majority party for the very first time.

In May 1961, a by-election was precipitated due to the passing of Anson constituency&#x27;s incumbent MP Baharuddin Mohammed Ariff. Marshall then went to declare his candidacy with the statement:

&quot;... effective, vigorous and constructive opposition and to protect them against the arrogant dictatorship of unchallenged power. Marshall was also eager to assist the workers to prevent the political enslavement of trade unions and to revive the struggle against colonialism in seeking complete independence preferably within and, if necessary, without the Federation.&quot;

On 15 July, Marshall won the by-election and subsequently returned to the Legislative Assembly.

David Marshall, as Chairman of the party, made his views known on merger at public rallies and radio talks. Marshall&#x27;s stand on merger was that:
&quot;... Singapore should seek equal privileges and rights for its citizens in the new federation but surrender autonomy in education and labour, since different policies in these crucial areas would undermine the stability of Malaysia in the long run. He further maintained that if Singapore could not negotiate for a complete merger, she should seek independence on her own, a proposition which drew gales of laughter from the Legislative Chamber at that time. Marshall&#x27;s strongest objection to the White Paper merger terms was on the point of citizenship and the implications of citizenship in the new federation. He saw the provisions as denying the Singapore citizen who was a federal national, the right of political participation in terms of being allowed to organise or contest in an election in the other states of the Federation. Singaporeans would in his view, be no more than favoured foreigners in the Federation, permitted to live and work there without visas, but also without the important constitutional guarantees that immigration barriers would not be raised against them.&quot;

The party concerned Marshall&#x27;s issue of common citizenship and the rights of Singapore citizens when they joined the Federation. Marshall later stated on 20 August 1962:

&quot;... issued a statement to advise his Executive Council and party members to accept the White Paper proposals for merger, but continued to oppose the Government on the referendum urging the people to cast blank votes on the grounds that it was undemocratically conducted.&quot;

===1965–1986: Post-independence, debut of J.B. Jeyaretnam===

On 9 August 1965, Singapore was declared as an independent sovereign state, and the Legislative was reformed as Parliament of Singapore. 1968 was the first post-independence election, which saw PAP winning every one of 58 contested seats (51 by a walkover, and the other seven on polling day), due to the election boycotting of the main opposition party at the time, the Barisan Sosialis, leading to the mass arrests of most of its leadership since 1963.

Having become a small and fairly insignificant party by the late-1960s, the party saw a rejuvenation by recruiting a group of lawyers, including J.B. Jeyaretnam, who became the party&#x27;s Secretary-General. Despite fielding a large slate of candidates in succeeding elections, the ruling PAP still managed to retain the monopoly by winning every contested seats for the next three general elections (including by-elections) until 1981.

On 13 October 1981, Devan Nair vacated his Anson seat to assume his role as the nation&#x27;s third President, and precipitated the by-election; on 31 October, the party&#x27;s victory was noted as historic as candidate Jeyaretnam became the first opposition MP-elect to be elected in Parliament with 51.9% (7,012) of the valid votes cast, beating PAP&#x27;s Pang Kim Hin&#x27;s 47.1% (6,359) and UPF&#x27;s Harbans Singh&#x27;s 1.0% (131), marking the first time since 1961 the Anson electorate voted the WP into the assembly. Jeyaretnam then went on to hold the constituency in the 1984 elections with an increased margin of 56.8%.

However, two months later, Jeyaretnam was charged with falsely accounting the party&#x27;s funds. In 1986, Senior District Judge Michael Khoo found Jeyaretnam innocent of all charges but one. The prosecution later appealed a retrial to be held in a different district court, which saw Jeyaretnam found guilty on all charges and resulted in his disqualification, though he subsequently remained as the party&#x27;s Secretary-General, he was also barred from standing in elections until 1991.

===1987–1997: Barisan Sosialis merger, debut of Low Thia Khiang===

In 1987, some members were among a group of 22 people arrested by Singapore&#x27;s Internal Security Department as part of Operation Spectrum, accused of being Marxists. They were released on condition that they kept out of politics.

Prior to the 1988 general elections, the party merged Barisan Sosialis and the Singapore United Front. The party did not win any constituency but came very close to winning the Eunos Group Representation Constituency (which was then a three-member constituency), in which the party&#x27;s team, consisting of Francis Seow (a former head of the Bar Society who had become a thorn in the government&#x27;s side and had briefly been detained under the Internal Security Act prior to the general election), Lee Siew Choh (a former chairman of the Barisan Sosialis and former PAP Assemblyman from 1959 to 1961) and Mohd Khalit bin Mohd Baboo, scored 49.1%; only one opposition MP was returned to Parliament (Chiam See Tong of the Singapore Democratic Party), and since the team garnered the highest percentage of the vote secured by losing opposition candidates at the election, the party was eligible to nominate two members of its team become Non-constituency MPs. The party had refused to nominate NCMPs in the past, but this time they nominated Lee and Seow to become NCMPs. While Lee accepted the offer, Seow however declined doing so and fled the United States following espionage accusations. The election also marked its debut of the party&#x27;s Organising Secretary Low Thia Khiang, who first contested the three-seat Tiong Bahru GRC, and would capture its eventual safe seat of Hougang SMC in the 1991 general election.

Jeyaretnam was for slander by the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew for comments he made at an election rally in 1988; Jeyaretnam was ordered to pay Lee damages of S$260,000 including costs following an unsuccessful lawsuit. Jeyaretnam was agained sued and paid damages of S$465,000 and S$250,000 in court costs for an article he wrote in an issue of the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Hammer&quot;, calling the PAP&#x27;s Indian leaders a bunch of stooges.

During the 1991 election campaign, one of the WP&#x27;s candidates in Eunos GRC, Jufrie Mahmood, drew particular fire from the PAP and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, accusing him of being a Malay chauvinist, an accusation Jufrie strongly denied. Unlike the last election, despite their team polled strongly in Eunos GRC, but lost to the PAP&#x27;s team with 47.6% of the votes to 52.4%, no NCMPs were offered as the opposition (including Low) elected a combined four seats in parliament. Following the election, Low became the Assistant Secretary-General.

A by-election in the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency in 1992 was expected to mark the return of Jeyaretnam to electoral politics after his Parliamentary ban had expired; however, the team ultimately did not participate due to one of the candidates turned up late on the nomination day. In 1993, Jeyaretnam and another candidate, Tan Soo Phuan (now a member of Democratic Progressive Party), attempted to seek candidacy in the first-ever presidential election, but both candidates were denied from granting the Certificate of Eligibility, an item presidential candidates was required to complete their nominations. In 1996, Lee Siew Choh resigned from the party, citing differences with Jeyaretnam, therefore confirmed his political retirement in 1993.

===1997–2006: Renewal in the new millennium ===
In the 1997 elections, Low was re-elected as Hougang MP at the 1997 general election. Besides Low, only one other opposition MP was elected (Chiam See Tong, who left SDP to join the Singapore People&#x27;s Party); one NCMP was offered to the WP team for Cheng San Group Representation Constituency, who polled better than any other opposition losing candidates, with 45.2%; the party selected secretary-general (and candidate) Jeyaretnam as the NCMP, marking his return to the Parliament after 11 years.

During the election campaign, another candidate part of the WP&#x27;s team in Cheng San, lawyer Tang Liang Hong, drew particular attention from the PAP, who accused him of being an anti-Christian and anti-Muslim Chinese chauvinist. Tang, who insisted all he was trying to do was to &quot;better represent the Chinese community and ask questions on their behalf&quot;, vigorously denied this charge and accused the PAP of trying to win votes by sowing fear into the electorate. Tang also attacked the PAP on the issue of the Hotel Properties Ltd case (which started when the Stock Exchange of Singapore criticised Hotel Properties Ltd for its &quot;tardiness&quot; in disclosing details of sales of its condominium units to directors and their family members). Lee who had purchased one of the units, claimed that Tang was trying to milk this issue for political capital; the PAP sued Tang for both defamation and branding the PAP leadership as a bunch of liars, for a total of S$13.6 million of damages, and Tang shortly fled to Australia after the election.

Prior to the 2001 election, Jeyaretnam was discharged from his NCMP seat due to an undischarged bankruptcy (failing to keep up with payments of S$120,000 worth of damages owed from a libel suit brought by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and other PAP leaders following comments he had made at an election rally in 1997, but since fulfilled and discharged from bankruptcy in May 2007); Jeyaretnam relinquished his Secretary-General post to Low, which saw the party in bitter acrimony as Jeyaretnam later accused Low of not doing enough to help him pay the damages from the libel suit. In response, Low claimed that he had always looked upon Jeyaretnam as an elder and had done everything possible to help him. Following the renewal, a few members (including Jeyaretnam) left the party, and went to form Reform Party in 2008, which would be Jeyaretnam&#x27;s final involvement in politics until his death three months after the founding.

Many observers speculated that with Low at the helm, WP would tone down its more hard-line stance and take on a more centrist outlook at the 2001 election. After Low assumed leadership, Low recruited a series of young members to the party, which include James Gomez, Yaw Shin Leong and Sylvia Lim (who would become the party&#x27;s long-serving (and current) chairperson). Although Low was re-elected as Hougang MP at the 2001 general election, the party&#x27;s fortunes reached a low as it only contested in two seats, in Hougang and Nee Soon East SMCs and had its entire Aljunied GRC team disqualified on Nomination Day.

===2006–2011: Major electoral breakthroughs, debut of Pritam Singh ===
WP launched an updated manifesto in January 2006 entitled &quot;You Have a Choice&quot;. The 52-page booklet outlined the party&#x27;s stand on issues and policies, covering areas from economic and judicial policies to media and sports and recreation. The manifesto, which had last been updated in 1994, took one year to work on according to Low. PAP then panned the party&#x27;s manifesto citing &quot;time-bombs&quot;, in which the party quipped that its manifesto contained only time bombs which threatened the PAP&#x27;s power.

At the 2006 general election, Low was elected as Hougang MP for the fourth time by an increased margin of 62.7%. The party also polled strongly in the Aljunied GRC, losing to the PAP&#x27;s team with 43.9% of the vote to 56.1%, allowing the party to elect an NCMP seat by-virtue for their team being best-performing opposition losers, and the party&#x27;s Chairman Lim was selected to become its first female NCMP. Another team of young first-time candidates, led by Yaw Shin Leong in Ang Mo Kio GRC helmed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, garnered a respectable 33.4% or one-third of the votes, slightly higher than the opposition&#x27;s national average. Combining from all the votes received from the seven constituencies contested by 20 candidates, their popular vote was 38.4%; as compared to the second opposition party, the Singapore Democratic Alliance (the party also fielded the same number of candidates contesting the same number of constituencies), where the party got 32.5%, the party then became the largest opposition for the election, and leader Low succeeded Chiam as the new leader of the opposition.

The manifesto for the General Election 2011 was titled &quot;Towards a First World Parliament&quot;, which also became their campaign slogan. One key proposal was for more affordable public housing such that Housing Development Board (HDB) lessees should be able to pay off their mortgage loans within 20 years rather than 30 years. Prior to nomination day (27 April 2011), Low announced that he would vacate his Hougang seat to former Ang Mo Kio GRC candidate Yaw Shin Long, and would contest in Aljunied GRC in the forthcoming election along with Lim and three of his &quot;A-List&quot; candidates (Taiwanese-born corporate lawyer Chen Show Mao, law postgraduate and former SAF major Pritam Singh, and freelance councillor Faisal Manap). The party fielded a total of 23 candidates contesting in eight constituencies, the largest slate since 1988 (WP had the second-largest opposition slate, second only to another opposition party, National Solidarity Party (NSP), which fielded 24 candidates in eight constituencies).

On 7 May, the team in Aljunied GRC achieved another breakthrough for the party, with the first-ever GRC victory for any opposition party in history, with a score of 54.71% to unseat the PAP team led by Foreign Minister George Yeo and Minister of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office Lim Hwee Hua. The Hougang ward was also retained by Yaw with its best performance for the party at 64.80% of the votes (second only to Chiam&#x27;s score of 69.6% back in 1991), resulting in six seats elected in Parliament. Their party&#x27;s overall vote was its best performance in history, with 46.58% of the votes combined from the eight constituencies contested (second only to SDP&#x27;s popular vote of 48.6% in 1991). Additionally, the election of chairwoman Lim and Manap, became the first female and former NCMP and Malay opposition MP, respectively, to be elected into Parliament.

Due to an increase of minimum opposition seats from three to nine, the party also won two of the three NCMP seats, which they elect Gerald Giam and Yee Jenn Jong (who contested East Coast Group Representation Constituency and Joo Chiat Single Member Constituency, respectively), bringing a total representation of eight seats, the most for any opposition party in Singapore since independence. Following the elections on 12 June, the party launched its grassroots arm for Aljunied GRC, called the Aljunied Constituency Committee. It also combined the Hougang and Aljunied town councils to form the Aljunied–Hougang Town Council.

=== 2012–2013: Success in by-elections and start of AHTC lawsuit ===
On 15 February 2012, the party expelled Hougang SMC MP Yaw Shin Leong, for failing to account for allegations made against him. Prior to his expulsion, Yaw was accused of several indiscretions in his private life, as well as party misconduct surfaced earlier that year; Yaw had up to 24 February to appeal against his expulsion, but declined, eventually precipitated the by-election which was due to be held on 26 May. The seat was retained by former East Coast GRC candidate Png Eng Huat with a majority of 62.08%. Shortly after the elections, Poh Lee Guan was also expelled from the party after Poh attempt to contest the by-election as a &quot;backup candidate&quot; without consulting the party&#x27;s CEC, and the CEC condemned Poh&#x27;s reason as unacceptable.

On 12 December, another by-election was called due to the vacation of Punggol East SMC&#x27;s MP and former speaker Michael Palmer for indiscretions with a People&#x27;s Association staff; the party announced the candidacy shortly after the announcement.

Prior to nomination day, the party announced plans to purchase its own premises as its current rented premises at Syed Alwi Road was too small for its operations. Sufficient funds were eventually raised and the new HQ was opened in 2017, coinciding the party&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

On 16 January 2013, the party fielded Lee Li Lian, a candidate previously contested the same ward on the 2011 election. On 26 January, Lee was elected to the parliament with 54.52% of the votes (her PAP rival Koh Poh Koon got 43.71%, and two other smaller parties 1.77%), marking their second by-election since 1981 the party won another parliamentary seat from the PAP.

Ahead of the two by-elections, WP calls for a tender for managing agent services for their town council, and only FMSS submits a bid. Their town council AHTC was briefly renamed to Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) from the by-election until the 2015 election. In February 2015, the Auditor-General&#x27;s Office (AGO) carried out an audit of AHPETC and found several lapses in governance and compliance, which became the subject of parliamentary debate. The trial is still ongoing as of 2025.

=== 2015–2016: Leadership renewal ===

Ahead from the 2015 elections, coinciding the nation&#x27;s golden jubilee, the party announced that it would contest 28 seats (from the ten constituencies), slightly under a third of the 89 parliamentary seats. They revealed their slogan for the election entitled &quot;Empower Your Future&quot;. In August 2015, chairwoman Lim confirmed the first batch of candidates, consist of all seven elected MPs, would defend their respective constituencies. By the end of the month, the party&#x27;s line-up were unveiled and finalised.

On 11 September, the team for Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC were re-elected for another term in Parliament, but by a reduced winning margin of 50.95% and 57.69%, respectively, while Punggol East SMC&#x27;s candidate Lee was defeated in her re-election bid to PAP&#x27;s candidate and Deputy Speaker Charles Chong by a vote count of 51.76%–48.24%. Their party&#x27;s overall vote (based on the ten constituencies contested, all of them were higher than the opposition&#x27;s national average of 30.14%) fell from 46.58% down to 39.75% as well.

Consequently, the party became the only opposition party to represent in the Parliament for the first time since 1981–84, as the party won all the three NCMPs and formed an opposition of nine. Lee was the first of the three NCMPs but declined the offer; Fengshan SMC&#x27;s candidate Dennis Tan was next in line for the second NCMP seat, while the party&#x27;s East Coast GRC team nominated Leon Perera for the third seat. Following Lee&#x27;s decline of offer, the party announced that they would nominate Daniel Goh as the third NCMP should the Parliament allow another appointment for NCMP. The appointment was approved by the PAP legislature on 29 January 2016, allowing Goh to be elected NCMP on an announcement from the Election Department on 4 February.

On 29 May 2016, leader Low successfully fended off an unprecedented challenge for his Secretary-General post by Chen for the first time in the party&#x27;s history. Chen was re-appointed by Low in his previous position as Treasurer for another three months from 7 June 2016 until 9 September 2016, as he had already served two terms in the post. On 7 June, the party appointed Pritam Singh as Assistant Secretary-General.

=== 2016–2019: Continued AHTC lawsuits and handover to Pritam Singh ===

On 26 July 2017, the Aljunied–Hougang Town Council, which had appointed an independent panel of three lawyers at the behest of MND and HDB, was suing town council chairman Singh, vice-chairman Lim, party&#x27;s leader Low, and three others including the town council&#x27;s former managing agent, for improper payments made to the MA.

On 29 September, the party&#x27;s headquarters were relocated from Syed Alwi Road to the Teambuild Centre, located at Geylang Road.

On 3 November, an anniversary dinner was held on Harbourfront Centre, marking a milestone of 60 years since the founding of the party on 3 November 1957. On the same night, Low announced on his speech that he would step down from his role of Secretary-General and would not seek candidacy for the next CEC&#x27;s election the following year. A commemorative biographical book for the party, &quot;Walking With Singapore&quot;, was launched at bookstores the following day.

Singh was elected to the post of Secretary-General unopposed on 8 April 2018 after Low decided to step down for leadership renewal.

On 26 July, the Party was among the nine opposition parties invited for a gathering led by former PAP member and Presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock, but the party did not attend. WP later revealed that the party was &quot;going through a leadership transition and is focused on organisation building to better serve Singaporeans&quot;.

On 3 October, a $33.7 million trial between Aljunied–Hougang Town Council and former leader Low, Chair Lim, secretary-general Singh as well as two other town councillors was initiated. The trial went on until 25 October, where the three politicians launched an appeal to fund their legal fees, citing that they had depleted their personal resources after paying their lawyers close to S$600,000 for work done before the trial. Three days later, they closed their fundraising appeal after raising more than S$1 million for legal fees, while thanking the public for their support.

===2020–2025: Further gains and inroads, member exits and Khan&#x27;s controversy===

Ahead of the elections on 10 July 2020, the party introduced their slogan, &quot;Make Your Vote Count&quot; along with 12 new party members, which included ex-NSP candidate Nicole Seah. During nominations, they fielded a total of 21 candidates to contest in six constituencies, including the newly formed Sengkang GRC, as well as Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC.

Low Thia Khiang, along with two incumbents Chen Show Mao and Png Eng Huat, did not contest the election, marking Low&#x27;s retirement after a 32-year career. Low was earlier hospitalised on 30 April due to a head injury he sustained and was on rehabilitation. They were respectively replaced by NCMPs Gerald Giam, Leon Perera and Dennis Tan to complete the team line-up. Former NCMP Daniel Goh and former Punggol East MP Lee Li Lian also did not stand for the election.

During campaigning, Sengkang GRC candidate Jamus Lim received critical acclaim during the live debate which was held on 1 July for his debating skills and charisma. On 5 July, two separate police reports were lodged against Raeesah Khan (another Sengkang GRC candidate) both for alleged comments relating to discrimination of race and religion, in which she explained to the media to promote awareness while also expressing remorse on posting insensitive comments. Raeesah was eventually warned by the Singapore Police Force on 17 September 2020.

On 10 July, the Workers&#x27; Party became the best performing opposition party to date, having won a total of 10 seats and garnering 50.49% of votes in constituencies they contested, surpassing the previous record held by SDP in 1991, which got 48.6%. The party increased their margins in Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC with 59.95% and 61.21% respectively, while also capturing the new Sengkang GRC with a 52.12% vote, making it the second GRC to be captured by any opposition party. Unlike in the past three elections, the party was not offered NCMPs seats as their result for the best performing losing constituency of East Coast GRC (46.61%) was not enough to be awarded a seat, falling behind West Coast GRC (led by the Progress Singapore Party), which garnered 48.32%.

Following the election, Hougang SMC became the first constituency to be elected by the opposition for seven terms, while Singh was appointed as the official Leader of the Opposition by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the role previously being unofficial in the past.

On 27 December, five months after the elections, another CEC election was held at Clarke Quay, with Lim and Singh re-elected as Chair and Secretary-General respectively. All four Sengkang GRC members, as well as Nicole Seah and Kenneth Foo were elected into the CEC, while former MPs Chen, Goh and Lee, as well as Firuz Khan, John Yam and Terence Tan, stepped down.

On 30 November 2021, Sengkang MP Raeesah Khan resigned from the Workers&#x27; Party and Parliament after investigations into lying during parliamentary speeches on women&#x27;s empowerment, which happened three months earlier. Two days later, the Workers&#x27; Party Central Executive Committee said they knew about the lies the week after her speech, but they decided to let her set the record straight after knowing her circumstances. Furthermore, the Party leaders voted overwhelmingly to ask Raeesah to resign even before she did so, with expulsion if she did not resign. Instead, Raeesah informed Pritam she would resign, before the Central Executive Committee met on the matter. In addition, the MPs of Sengkang GRC will not step down for a by-election, with the responsibilities of Compassvale divided accordingly. Workers&#x27; Party Vice-Chair and Aljunied GRC MP Faisal Manap will also act as an advisor to the Sengkang MPs. Former NCMP Daniel Goh then publicly questioned Khan&#x27;s resignation on Facebook in several posts and also requested that the party leadership take some responsibility for &quot;allowing the transgression to persist&quot;. Goh was subsequently expelled from the party in 2023.

On 17 July 2023, a video of MP Leon Perera and the party&#x27;s youth wing president Nicole Seah behaving intimately in a restaurant surfaced online. Perera&#x27;s former personal driver collaborated in the alleged relationship in a press interview. While he had approached the party leaders about this between 2020 and 2021, they deferred to the pair&#x27;s denials. Seah and Perera resigned on 18 July and 19 July 2023 respectively, acknowledging the extramarital affair had happened and &quot;stopped sometime ago&quot;. Both members had since denied any accusations. The responsibilities of Perera were subsequently divided among the remaining MPs of Aljunied GRC. On 11 September, Perera revealed that his Facebook account had been hacked with posts dating after 17 June 2021 deleted, and he had since reported the hack to Meta. While Perera had since surfaced to Progress Singapore Party sometime in January 2025, he had since resided in New York City, implying that he would unlikely contest in the election; PSP also confirmed that Perera had not yet joined the party.

On 7 July 2023, the Supreme Court of Singapore found both Lim and Low, and not Singh, liable for control failures in regards to payment processes in both Aljunied-Hougang and Sengkang Town Councils, leading to a risk of overpayment. The court found them to have breached their fiduciary duties in 2019, but a subsequent appeal in 2022 revealed that its party councillors and the town employees did not owe fiduciary duties. On 22 August, the Ministry of National Development brought considerations for regulatory action pending clarification from AHTC, under witness of its three party leaders, as well as town councillors Chua Zhi Hon, Kenneth Foo, How Weng Fan and Danny Loh, to ensure the safekeeping of the money totaling S$33.7 million in improper payments. In a statement from the Court of Appeal on 29 November, both town councils were ordered to pay a combined total of about S$388,800 (S$176,241.11 and S$212,543.52 for AHTC and SKTC, respectively) to the town councillors as a result of the appeals, where the court determined that most issues in their appeals were not found from AHTC, and that liabilities of certain duties has since persisted. The three aforementioned MPs, however, had also been liable for negligence to SKTC for permitting control failures as well.

On 19 March 2024, Pritam Singh was charged in court for two counts on falsely testifying to a parliamentary committee in relating to Raeesah Khan&#x27;s mishandling of a case dating back to November 2021; Singh took a four-week adjournment to engage a lawyer prior to a pre-trial, to be held on April 17. He would remain, however, as an MP when he was on trial. The other WP member involved, Faisal Manap, was not charged. Singh was given a verdict on 17 February 2025 where he pleaded guilty for these charges and given a $7,000 fine for both counts and had since lodged for appeal, Under constitution that a candidate would face disqualification from election and a vacation of a seat, however, Singh retains the eligibility as each of the separate charges does not meet the threshold requirements for disqualification (of at least a $10,000 fine or a year imprisonment).

On 3 November 2022, a three-minute trailer on a documentary titled &quot;Hougang&quot; was uploaded on their YouTube page to commemorate the 65th anniversary of founding. A full video of the documentary was released exactly two years later.

=== 2025-present: WP after Low&#x27;s retirement ===
Ahead of the 2025 Singaporean general election, on 7 December 2024, Low Thia Khiang announced that he would retire from politics but would remain a member of the party&#x27;s central executive committee, despite initially expressed interest on his return. In a recent CEC update on 30 June 2024, former MP Lee Li Lian, who was working as a councilor in Sengkang Town Council at the time, was reinstated into the CEC after a three-year absence.

==Ideology==

The Workers&#x27; Party brands itself as a credible, constructive and rational opposition party in Parliament that does not simply &quot;oppose for the sake of opposing&quot;. It wishes to hold the government into account for any issues concerning Singaporeans and where Singaporeans are able to exercise their rights in political participation.

For starters, when policies presented in Parliament benefit Singaporeans on both sides of the political spectrum, it pledges to support it. However, if such policies are insufficient and does not benefit or put Singaporeans at a disadvantage, it will voice out on behalf of Singaporeans in parliamentary debates to seek a compromise. The party has also promised that its MPs will ask &quot;hard questions&quot; that the governing PAP MPs will not mention in Parliament, such as the 2017 corruption scandal in Brazil of the Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine branch of Keppel Corporation, a government-linked corporation conglomerate which was founded by Temasek Holdings.

Historically influenced by Keynesian economics, the party favours government intervention in the economy and some redistribution of wealth. Taxation was seen as a means to achieve a &quot;major redistribution of wealth and income&quot; in previous manifestos. The party also desires increased rights for Singaporean workers and a welfare state, such as allocating greater expenditures towards the country&#x27;s public healthcare system.

In general, the Workers’ Party&#x27;s core ideology is centre-left, with some more leftist factions. The Workers&#x27; Party pledged in its manifesto to support the middle, working and other lower classes. Whereas the party leans left in general, it has also advocated for a more centrist calibrated approach in regards to immigration. It has, for instance, proposed that the overall number of foreign workers should be capped if Singapore can achieve a 1% annual growth rate in the local workforce.

<text>Fanny Matilda Dagmar Hamlin (born 23 October 1987 in Stockholm, Sweden), known professionally as Faye, is a former Swedish singer, songwriter, and model. She was the lead singer of the Swedish pop group Play in the early 2000s. In 2012, she debuted as a solo artist. Hamlin quit the music industry in 2014.

==Early life==
Fanny &quot;Faye&quot; Matilda Dagmar Hamlin grew up in Täby, a suburb outside of Stockholm with her parents, older sister, and older brother. When she was 11 years old, she won a national talent contest. Hamlin attended Rytmus, a performing arts high school in Stockholm. She has referenced Beyonce and Destiny&#x27;s Child as influences.

==Career==

===2000–2003: Play===
In 2000, at the age of 13, Faye was one of hundreds of young girls to audition for a spot in Play, an all-girl pop group formed by Laila Bagge, Anders Bagge, and Andreas Carlsson in Stockholm, Sweden. After nationwide auditions, Faye and her best friend Rosanna were selected to be a part of the group. While rehearsing at Laila&#x27;s home, Tommy Mottola (who was involved in a phone conversation with Bagge) overheard the group in the background. He was so impressed with their sound that he flew them to Los Angeles a few days later. After performing for label executives, Play was signed to Columbia Records. Faye was considered to be the lead voice of Play and, as a mezzo-soprano, she was often heard singing the melody and doing the ad-libs in songs.

In December 2001, Play released their first album entitled &quot;Us Against the World&quot;. The album peaked at number 74 on the Billboard Top 200 and their debut single, &quot;Us Against the World&quot;, found success on Radio Disney and Nickelodeon. Play also made a cameo appearance in Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen&#x27;s movie Holiday in the Sun performing &quot;Us Against the World&quot;. To promote the album, the group toured nearly non-stop for a year, opening for Destiny&#x27;s Child, Aaron Carter, and touring with Eden&#x27;s Crush and A-Teens. Their song &quot;Disco Hippie&quot; was featured on a commercial for Build-A-Bear Workshop. In 2002, they recorded a song and later a filmed a video with Lil&#x27; Fizz, formerly of B2K, for the Master of Disguise film.

In June 2003, the group released their sophomore album titled &quot;Replay&quot;, which debuted at number 67 on the Billboard Top 200, and remained on the chart for several weeks. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;I Must Not Chase The Boys&quot; reached Number 10 on MTV&#x27;s &quot;TRL&quot;. The group later went on to perform &quot;I Must Not Chase The Boys&quot; on Live with Regis and Kelly. After nearly a year hiatus, it was officially reported in October 2003 that Faye had left the group to return to college, and was replaced by Janet Leon, a 13-year-old singer from Gothenburg.

In 2010, Faye recalled her decision to leave the group saying, &quot;In autumn 2003, I chose to drop out of Play. The sense of feeling lost, tired and alone had been around for a while, but it was in the autumn that I became fed up and made the decision to leave. Strangely enough, it was loneliness that was most evident towards the end, although I had always had people around me, it was still short of securing the pillars. I was far from home and just wanted to be with family and friends. I chose to invest all my time in high school. Luckily, my mom helped me with applications to the music school Rytmus.&quot;

===2004–2009: Modeling and music===
After leaving Play, Faye returned to college and modeling, attending the music school Rytmus and signing with Swedish modeling agency Synkcasting. Faye appeared in several photo shoots and runway shows. She also kept her foot in the music business, releasing occasional singles through modeling campaigns and providing background vocals.

In 2004 Faye performed a duet with Adam Appel titled &quot;Ready for Love&quot; that was featured on the soundtrack to the Swedish film &quot;Kärlekens Språk&quot;. In 2006 Faye provided background vocals for Swedish artist Velvet&#x27;s album &quot;Finally&quot;, most notably on the track &quot;Mi Amore.&quot;

In February 2008, Faye appeared in commercials for Swedish clothing chain MQ. The commercials featured Faye performing the Fleetwood Mac hit &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; in a style all her own. Behind the scene videos were posted to MQ&#x27;s website and the full song and music video were made available for download.

In November 2008, Faye was once again featured in an MQ campaign. This campaign saw Faye perform the Supertramp hit &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; alongside some of Sweden&#x27;s most popular stars including Nina Persson of The Cardigans, Darin and Marie Serneholt. The full version of the song was made available for purchase and proceeds benefited The Red Cross.

===2009–2011: Play&#x27;s reunion===
In 2009, Play was reported to have reunited, without original member Anna Sundstrand. Two weeks before they were scheduled to go back into the studio, member Rosanna Munter decided not to continue with the group, saying in a statement she &quot;has worked hard on my own music, and I want to give it the chance to be heard.&quot;. The group continued as a trio with Faye Hamlin, Anaïs Lameche, and a new member, Sanne Karlsson via the popular Swedish television program, &quot;Made in Sweden&quot;. The group achieved a number one single with &quot;Famous&quot; and a top ten album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; in Sweden. The comeback was a success. Shortly after the group came to promote the album in the U.S., Faye, now going by her birth name, Fanny, left the group for a second time to pursue her own music career in late 2010. She later stated that the atmosphere in the group had changed, and that she no longer wanted to be part of it. In January 2011, it was officially announced that Faye had left Play; she was replaced by Swedish singer Emelie Norenberg. No new music with Norenberg was ever released. The group split for the third time in mid-2011. Plans for the group&#x27;s subsequent album and a promo tour in the U.S. were cancelled.

===2011–2014: Solo career===
In January 2012, it was announced that Faye had signed with Scandinavian record label Hybris. Working with Swedish producing duo Montauk, her debut single, &quot;Come to Me,&quot; was released for digital download in Sweden and in the United States on 29 February 2012. The single showed a new direction for Faye that was more mature and complex electropop than her previous work.

In late May 2012, Faye signed with UK-based record label Best Fit Recordings. Her second single, &quot;Water Against The Rocks,&quot; was released in the UK on 25 June 2012. The official music video for &quot;Water Against The Rocks&quot; premiered on 28 May 2012 on &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; official website. On 20 September 2012 Best Fit Recordings announced two new singles &quot;Mad Dog&quot; and &quot;Breathe Out.&quot; and on 12 December 2012, Best Fit Recordings released a fifth teaser track, &quot;Silent.&quot;

In January 2013, Faye opened a sold out show as support for British singer-songwriter Jessie Ware at New York City&#x27;s Bowery Ballroom. This performance was followed by two additional performances at Pianos and Glasslands. In March 2013 Faye set her sights on Los Angeles, performing three shows.

In March 2013, Faye performed a set of shows at South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. Her experience at SXSW was featured in an episode of the American late night television program &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;, marking her debut on US television as a solo artist.

She wrote a complete album with producing duo Montauk and has co-written a song, &quot;The Fever Keeps Me Breathing,&quot; for Swedish producer Kleerup&#x27;s upcoming album. She has said her debut album was written during &quot;a low period in [her] life&quot; which influenced the dark pop elements.

On 9 March 2014 Faye announced via a Facebook post that she has signed to Capitol Records and has been working with producers Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins (Mary J. Blige, Natasha Bedingfield, Janet Jackson) and Daniel Heath (Lana Del Rey). Hamlin quit the music industry in 2014 and plans for her solo debut album were shelved indefinitely.

==Personal life==
After leaving the music industry in 2014, Hamlin returned to her previous work as a fashion and commercial model in her native Sweden. In 2016, she revealed via her personal Instagram account that she had changed careers and is now a home interior stylist and set designer. In May 2017, her work was featured in a collaboration with the Swedish headphones and accessories brand, Urbanears. She works as a stylist for the Swedish home design magazine &quot;Plaza Interiör&quot;. On 21 September 2017, she announced on her Instagram page the birth of her first child, a daughter named Joni Florence Kerstin. Hamlin married her longtime boyfriend in June 2019 in Flatön, Sweden. In April 2021, she gave birth to her second child, a daughter named Fleur. She resides in the suburbs of Stockholm with her husband and their children.

<text>The cliff swallow or American cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) is a member of the passerine bird family Hirundinidae, the swallows and martins. The generic name &quot;Petrochelidon&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;stone&quot; and () &quot;swallow&quot;, and the specific name &quot;pyrrhonota&quot; comes from &quot;purrhos&quot; meaning &quot;flame-coloured&quot; and &quot;-notos&quot; &quot;-backed&quot;.

Cliff swallows are extremely social songbirds that can be found in large nesting colonies reaching over 2,000 nests. They are frequently seen flying overhead in large flocks during migration, gracefully foraging over fields for flying insects or perching tightly together on a wire preening under the sun.

Cliff swallows build gourd-shaped nests made from mud with small entrance holes. They build their nests tightly together, on top of one another, under bridges or alongside mountain cliffs. Living in large populations, these aerial insectivores use extensive vocalizations to communicate warnings or food availability to the other individuals.

== Description ==
The cliff swallow&#x27;s average body length is , and they have short legs and small bills with relatively long pointed wings. Adult cliff swallows have an overall dark brownish plumage covering both their back and wings, and they have a characteristic white forehead, rich red-coloured cheeks with a dark throat, basic white underparts and a buffy-coloured rump. In good lighting conditions, their crowns and mantle feathers are iridescent. The Northern population is slightly larger in body size and also differs in facial markings from the Mexican population of cliff swallows, which have a chocolate-brown patch on their foreheads.

The male and female have identical plumage, therefore sexing them must be done through palpation of the cloaca. During the breeding season, the males will have a harder cloaca that is more pronounced because the seminal vesicles are swollen. In addition, during incubation females will lose feathers on their lower breast to create a warm patch for sitting on their eggs. Cliff swallows are similar in body plumage colouring to the related barn swallow species but lack the characteristic fork-shaped tail of the barn swallow prominent during flight. The cliff swallows have a square-shaped tail.

Juvenile cliff swallows have an overall similar body plumage colouring to the adults, with paler tones. The juveniles lack the iridescent adult plumages, and their foreheads and throats appear speckled white. The juvenile cliff swallows&#x27; white forehead and throat markings have high variance between unrelated individuals compared with those from the same clutch. These distinctive white facial markings disappear during maturity following their complex-basic moult pattern, because their pre-formative plumage is different from the basic plumage. The pre-formative facial plumage has been suggested as a possible way for parents nesting in large colonies to recognize their chicks.

== Taxonomy ==

The cliff swallow belongs to the largest order and dominant avian group – &quot;Passeriformes&quot;. They are the perching birds, or the passerines. All the bird species in this order have four toes, three pointing forward and one pointing backwards (anisodactylous), that enable them to perch with ease. The sub-order that the cliff swallow belongs to is &quot;Oscines&quot; (or Passeri), for the songbirds. The family that encompasses approximately 90 species of swallows and martins, &quot;Hirundinidae&quot;, includes birds that have small stream-lined bodies made for great agility and rapid flight. Furthermore, those in the family Hirundinidae have short-flat bills for their largely insectivorous diets, small feet because they spend much of their time in flight and long wings for energy-efficient flight.

There are five subspecies of cliff swallow distinguished on the basis of plumage colour, body size, and distribution – &quot;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota pyrrhonota&quot;, &quot;P. p. melanogaster&quot;, &quot;P. p. tachina&quot;, &quot;P. p. hypopolia&quot;, &quot;P. p. ganieri&quot;. In addition, three core genera of &quot;hirundo&quot; were established on the basis of molecular studies: &quot;Hirundo sensu stricto&quot;, containing the barn swallow; &quot;Cecropis&quot;, containing the red-rumped swallow; and &quot;Petrochelidon&quot;, containing the cliff swallow. The genetic tests deemed &quot;Petrochelidon&quot; and &quot;Cecropis&quot; sister to each other and both closest to &quot;Delichon&quot;, the house martins. Finally, the cave swallow was identified as the nearest living relative in North America of the cliff swallow. The cave swallow has a similar plumage to the cliff swallow; however, the former has a dark cap and pale throat, and also a much smaller distribution in North America, most likely due to a decline in suitable cave sites.

== Habitat and distribution ==
As their name suggests, throughout history the cliff swallows concentrated their nesting colonies along mountain cliffs, primarily by the western North American coast. Today, with the development of highways, concrete bridges, and buildings this adaptable bird species is rapidly adjusting its common nesting sites, with populations expanding further east and building their mud nests on these concrete infrastructures. Thus, the cliff swallow&#x27;s breeding range includes large areas across Canada and the United States, excluding some Southern and Northern areas. The majority of nesting colonies are situated in close proximity to fields, ponds, and other ecosystems that would hold a large variety of flying insect populations to sustain their energy requirements during the breeding season.

The cliff swallows&#x27; wintering grounds have been recorded as South American countries, such as Southern Brazil, Uruguay, and parts of Argentina. However, their behavior and populations have yet to be extensively studied on their wintering grounds leaving room for new information about this species. The cliff swallows are long-distance day-migrants that generally travel along the North American coastlines. The Eastern populations travel through Florida, and the Western populations through Mexico and Central America down to their destinations. Flocks containing large numbers of cliff swallows have been recorded migrating together, but whether they stay together or disperse to different locations is unknown.

==Swallows of Capistrano==
The cliff swallow is famous for their regular migration to San Juan Capistrano, California. They nest at the church of Mission San Juan Capistrano, where their annual migration is culturally celebrated. A 1940 song by Leon René, &quot;When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano&quot;, celebrates this event.

== Behavior ==
Cliff swallows live in a colonial lifestyle during the breeding season, composed of a large number of pairs per nesting site. This group-style life can present the birds with some benefits and disadvantages; valuable information can be shared through group learning about food location and habitat preferences, but it is also much easier to transmit parasites or diseases when living in close proximity. The cliff swallows have an unusually large parasite community that includes ectoparasites, ticks, fleas and swallow bugs, among others. These parasite infestations have been shown to negatively affect juvenile growth and developmental rates.

Cliff swallows are socially monogamous, one pair will look after each nest, but many occurrences of sexual polygamy have been noted because of the varying genetics throughout the colony and within many individual nests. Both the female and the male cliff swallows will contribute to the colony&#x27;s genetic variability by performing various actions of brood parasitism. The cliff swallows have an &quot;aggressive and fearless&quot; personality in comparison to their relatives the barn swallows, who were noted as being &quot;timid and fearful&quot;.

=== Diet ===

The cliff swallows feed on a diet consisting of flying insects, particularly swarming species such as: flies, bees, lacewings, mayflies, butterflies, moths, grasshoppers, and damselflies. The birds forage high (usually 50 m or higher) over fields or marshes, and tend to rely on bodies of water like ponds during bad weather with high winds. These birds are day-hunters (diurnal), returning to their nesting sites at dusk, and are not very active during cold or rainy weather because of the low number of prey available. Foraging behaviors related closely to their reproduction cycle; when the birds first arrive at the nesting site they will forage as far as 10 miles from the colony, in the hopes of increasing body fat reserves to prepare for cold-windy days and their energy extensive egg-laying stage. When the swallows return to the nesting site at dusk, they often fly in a tightly coordinated flock overhead, in such close synchronization that they may appear as one large organism. These large group formations are called creches.

The cliff swallows&#x27; social behavior does not end with these &quot;synchronized flying&quot; displays; they use special vocalizations to advise other colony members of a good prey location where ample food is available. It has been thought that colony sites located close to marshes would have larger quantities of insects to support big populations; however, there are equally large nesting colonies located at a great distance from marshes.

=== Vocalisations ===
The social structure of these cliff swallow colonies has evolved a complex vocalisation system. Five vocalisations have been identified, which are used by both juveniles and adults for different reasons. These vocalisations are structurally similar across the age groups and can be described as begging, alarm, recognition, and squeak calls, all with some variations. Juvenile cliff swallows are said to have established a unique call by the approximate age of 15 days, which allows the parents to identify their chick from others in the colony.

The &quot;squeak&quot; call is of great interest to researchers because this is the special vocalisation made at a distance from the colony when a bird encounters a good foraging area. When this call is heard, large groups of their colony &quot;neighbours&quot; will arrive at the location. This &quot;squeak&quot; call is used greatly during bad weather conditions. For this specific call, the cliff swallows are one of the few known vertebrates to make a &quot;competitively disadvantageous&quot; cue to their peers for food availability.

Alarm calls are heard at the colony while the birds are flying over and around the colony entrance way, and serve as a signal of danger close to the nests. When this call is heard by the other colony members, a mass fleeing of birds out and away from their nests is observed.
=== Reproduction ===
The breeding season of cliff swallows starts with the return of the birds from their wintering grounds. They usually arrive in large groups and start immediately to choose their nesting sites. The cliff swallows have been observed to skip from one to five years between breeding at the same place to avoid parasite infestations, but some pairs will return annually to the same site. Particularly for younger pairs, the size of the colony can affect their reproductive success, because they seem to rely on the valuable information that can be obtained from a large colony. Older birds are usually found in smaller colonies and exhibit earlier nesting times, avoiding the parasite manifestation that comes with the hot mid-summer season.
Cliff swallows decide upon arrival at their nesting site whether they will fix a nest from the previous season or build a new nest. Building a new nest may have the benefit of lower parasite numbers, but it is very energy expensive and time-consuming. Further, taking the extra time to build a nest from scratch will mean reproducing later which could negatively affect their chicks&#x27; survival. Nests constructed with sticky clay can last a number of years and are further supported by the cliff swallows&#x27; tier-stacking construction strategy. Cliff swallows from the same colony socially collect mud for nest building, being seen converging at small areas together and then carrying globs of mud in their bills back to their nests.

Each bird pair will have about 3–4 nestlings per brood; a clutch size of 4 has been identified as the most common and most successful. The cliff swallows brood-parasitize neighboring nests, where the females may move their eggs into or lay their eggs in other nests. The females who show intra-specific parasitism tend to have greater reproductive success than those that were brood-parasitized. The &quot;victims&quot; of brood-parasitism must nurture more chicks with higher energy costs and decreased fitness because they are raising young that will not pass on their own genetic material. The male cliff swallows will also take part in this gene-spread by mating with more than just one female, contributing to genetic variation throughout the colony.

The nesting sites can be vulnerable to predation by other cavity-nesting bird species, such as the house sparrow. These birds will search a number of swallow nests for the perfect place to make their own nest, destroying numerous eggs in the process. Nests, especially those at the periphery of colonies, are vulnerable to snake predation. Central nests are more coveted, have larger clutches, and are preferred for reuse in subsequent years 

Once the house sparrows pick their nest, they will bring in grass and other materials making it impossible for the cliff swallows to re-establish their place. Thus, the colonies with house sparrow predation have an overall lower success rate and fewer previous-year nests being used.

<text>Nancy Elizabeth Johnson (née Lee; born January 5, 1935) is an American lobbyist and politician from the state of Connecticut. Johnson was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 2007, representing the 6th district and later the 5th District after reapportionment.

In September 2007, Johnson began lobbying for Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell &amp; Berkowitz, PC in Washington, D.C.

== Early life, education, and early career ==
Nancy Johnson was born in Chicago. She graduated from the University of Chicago Laboratory School (high school) in 1953, and from Radcliffe College of Harvard University in 1957. She attended the University of London&#x27;s Courtauld Institute of Art in 1957 and 1958. She later moved to New Britain, Connecticut, where she lives today.

She was an active volunteer in the schools and social service agencies of her community, before serving in the Connecticut Senate from 1977 to 1983.

== House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===

Johnson was elected to the House of Representatives in 1982 with 52 percent of the vote, defeating Democratic state senator William E. Curry Jr. She replaced Democrat Anthony &quot;Toby&quot; Moffett, who made an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate that year.

She won narrowly in her re-election bid in 1996, defeating Democrat Charlotte Koskoff 50%–49%, her only close race for re-election. She attributed her decreased percentage to the time she had spent on the House ethics panel, dealing with ethics allegations against Speaker Newt Gingrich, which prevented her from getting around in her district. She won in 1998, again against Koskoff, with 59% of the vote, and got 63% of the vote in 2000 against Paul Valenti.

Had Al Gore won the 2000 presidential election, Johnson was widely considered to be the front runner to win the appointment of Governor John G. Rowland to serve in the United States Senate, filling the seat of Gore&#x27;s running mate Joe Lieberman. Lieberman had been reelected to the Senate at the same time as the presidential election.

In 2002, Johnson&#x27;s New Britain-based district was merged with the Waterbury-based 5th District of Democratic Congressman James H. Maloney. While the new district retained Maloney&#x27;s district number, its geography and demographics slightly favored Johnson. She won the general election over Maloney with 54% of the vote. In 2004, she defeated Democrat Theresa Gerratana, getting 60% of the vote.

=== 2006 re-election campaign ===

In the November 2006 general election, Johnson faced Democrat Chris Murphy, a state senator originally elected from the First District town of Southington, Connecticut, who now lives in Cheshire.

In April 2006, Johnson became the target of a negative ad campaign run by a political action committee, &quot;MoveOn.org&quot;, which alleged ties to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff and former Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX). Johnson responded with her own advertising campaign dismissing the charges and strongly attacking Murphy, accusing him of not disavowing the MoveOn attack ads.

Johnson had a large cash advantage over her challenger. In April 2006, Johnson reported that she had raised $436,000 in the first quarter of the year, with 60% of that coming from PACs, and 56% from contributors from outside Connecticut. In the second quarter of 2006 she raised almost $800,000, and had cash on hand, as of June 30, 2006, of $2.6 million.

In late October, Chris Murphy had a slight lead, and heading into the election, polls showed him ahead by four points. Johnson ultimately lost the race in November to Chris Murphy by 12 points; the only House incumbent to suffer a worse defeat was John Hostettler (IN-08).

Articles in the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; speculated that Johnson&#x27;s negative TV ads, which accused Murphy of coddling sex offenders and drug dealers, may have proven counterproductive. Johnson won only six of the district&#x27;s 41 towns, losing many areas that had reliably supported her in the past. For instance, she lost badly in New Britain, an area she had represented for 30 years at both the federal and state level. She had failed to carry New Britain in her last two elections.

=== Ideology ===
Johnson is a moderate Republican. She called herself &quot;an independent voice in Washington&quot;, although she frequently supported the mainstream Republican agenda. Some nonpartisan observers such as National Journal rated her near the ideological midpoint in the House, although others, like the American Conservative Union (ACU) rated her as a moderate conservative. The ACU gave Johnson&#x27;s 2005 voting record 40 points out of 100; the liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave her 35 points. In general, she was moderate-to-liberal on social issues and conservative on economic ones.

Johnson is a member of several socially moderate Republican groups including The Wish List, The Republican Main Street Partnership, Republicans for Choice, the Republican Majority for Choice, and Republicans for Environmental Protection, now known as ConservAmerica, although she has supported many elements of President George W. Bush&#x27;s agenda and the agenda of conservative House leaders.

In 1998, Johnson voted for two of the four articles of impeachment then-President Bill Clinton—the only member of the Connecticut delegation to support Clinton&#x27;s impeachment.

In 2003, Johnson voted with the House Democrats to oppose Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. The bill was passed by a large majority 281–142 on October 2, 2003.

In 2006, Johnson attracted considerable controversy after voting against a Republican budget reconciliation bill that passed the House by two votes. She was one of 14 moderate Republicans who crossed party lines to side with Democrats against it.

=== Issues ===
Johnson is a strong supporter of Republican policy on health care and the Iraq War, but opposed the Bush energy agenda, including oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) refuge. She has received favorable marks and awards from such groups as the National Education Association and the Sierra Club.

In 2005, Johnson supported the White House plan to partially privatize Social Security, and voted for a measure sponsored by then-Majority Leader Tom DeLay that would have weakened House ethics rules.

One of Johnson&#x27;s central issues is health care. She was one of the authors of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program, which took effect in 2006. On May 15, 2006, Johnson announced she would submit legislation to waive penalties for those who miss deadlines to enroll in Medicare Part D, reacting to widespread criticism of the Johnson-authored program. Her bill was unsuccessful but was supported by the AARP.

She also authored the legislation that allowed welfare recipients to remain eligible for Medicaid, adding a more moderate influence to the welfare reform law.

=== Committees ===
In 1988, Johnson became the first Republican woman to be named to the powerful Ways and Means Committee. She eventually rose to chair three separate Ways and Means subcommittees.

With the retirement of Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA) at the end of the 109th Congress in 2006, Johnson was a possible candidate to replace him as chairman if Republicans were to retain the House and Johnson retained her seat in the November elections. Neither happened.

In 1983, Johnson was one of the original congressional members of the United States House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families.

=== Campaign contributors ===
Connecticut is a center of the pharmaceutical industry with Pfizer and Bayer operating major facilities in the state. According to the nonpartisan OpenSecrets, Johnson had been one of the leading Congressional recipients of contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, receiving $534,830 in related contributions since 2000.

==Post-congressional career==
Following her career in Congress, in 2007 Johnson became a resident fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Institute of Politics. She also served as co-chair of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a public policy think tank.

In October 2007, Johnson endorsed former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s bid for the Republican presidential nomination.

In 2013, Johnson was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

==Personal life==
Johnson is married to Theodore Johnson, an obstetrics and gynaecology (OBGYN) physician; and has three adult daughters.

<doc id="410194" wikidata="Q4752472" url="?curid=410194" title="Anaïs Lameche">
<text>Anaïs Helena Lameche Bonnier (née Kretz Lameche; born 19 August 1987) is a Swedish former singer and one of the original members of the Swedish pop group Play. She is the only member of Play out of its seven different members to appear in all four different line-ups of the group. Before the band&#x27;s split, she was also the last remaining original member of the group since Faye&#x27;s second departure in January 2011. She quit the music industry in 2011.

==Early life==
Lameche was born in the French Alps. Her father is French. The family eventually moved back to Täby, Sweden. where Lameche&#x27;s mother is from. She has an older sister, Amanda, who previously had a solo career as a singer. She has three younger half sisters and a younger half brother, following her parents&#x27; divorce.

==Music career: Play (2001–2005)==
In 2001, Play&#x27;s first single &quot;Us Against the World&quot; was featured on the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie &quot;Holiday In The Sun&quot;. &quot;Us Against the World&quot; was followed by &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; a cover of a Diana Ross song. The song featured Chris Trousdale from Dream Street and received heavy rotation on Radio Disney.

Their first album dropped in 2001. &quot;Us Against the World&quot; included both singles plus 5 additional songs.

In 2003, &quot;Replay&quot; was released with 2 big hits &quot;Whole Again&quot; and &quot;I Must Not Chase the Boys.&quot; It also featured another Diana Ross cover &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough.&quot; After Replay&#x27;s release, Faye Hamlin left the group to pursue education and modeling and was replaced by Janet Leon.

In 2004, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; was released with the single being &quot;everGirl&quot; for a Nickelodeon series that was filmed but not greenlit. There was also a duet with Aaron Carter &quot;Every Little Step.&quot; They also redid &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High&quot; with Janet Leon.

In late 2004, the Christmas album &quot;Play Around the Christmas Tree&quot; was released. It has 10 of their favorite Christmas songs. It also was their last recorded album.

Anaïs was asked to join Play by the group&#x27;s manager, Laila Bagge, who discovered Anaïs at her dancing school after the Lameche family settled in Näsbypark, Sweden. Anaïs&#x27; older sister, Amanda Lameche, had already worked with Laila Bagge and had released a pop record in the United States.

In Play, Anaïs sang alto harmonies and was considered to be one the Lead Vocalist. After the band&#x27;s first split, Anaïs studied at the University of Stockholm and the University of Lund.

In 2009, Lameche, along with Faye Hamlin and a new member, Sanne Karlsson, returned as Play, but as a trio. They were managed once more by Laila Bagge. They took part in &quot;Made in Sweden&quot; 2010, which documented their revival, search for a new third member, and recording and working on a new album. Their debut single from the album, &quot;Famous&quot;, entered the Swedish music charts at No. 1. The group&#x27;s fifth album and first with Sanne Karlsson, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, was released in April 2010. It peaked in the Swedish music charts at No. 7. An EP and promotion in the US was expected, but plans were later shelved. In May 2011, the band announced their separation, and Lameche left the music industry.

<text>Anna Maria Karolina Sundstrand (born 22 February 1989) is a Swedish singer. She is an original member of the Swedish pop group, Play.

== Early life ==
Sundstrand was born on 22 February 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden. She began dancing when she was four years old and attended Sway Dance School in Stockholm as well as her bandmate Anaïs Lameche. She is a relative of the Swedish actress Greta Garbo.

== Play (2001–2005) ==
Sundstrand was asked to join Play by the group&#x27;s manager, Laila Bagge, who discovered Sundstrand at her dancing school after seeing her performing at the school. Sundstrand was the first member of the new group, in which she sang alto harmonies and solos.

In 2001, Play&#x27;s first single &quot;Us Against the World&quot; was featured on the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen film &quot;Holiday in the Sun&quot; and Disney Channel show Lizzie McGuire. &quot;Us Against the World&quot; was followed by &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me,&quot; a cover of a song by Diana Ross and the Supremes and The Temptations. The song featured Chris Trousdale from Dream Street and received high rotation on Radio Disney. Their debut album, Us Against the World, was released in 2001.

In 2003, &quot;Replay&quot; was released, including two singles, &quot;Whole Again&quot; (a cover of the Atomic Kitten song) and &quot;I Must Not Chase the Boys,&quot; It also featured another Diana Ross cover, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough.&quot; After &quot;Replay&quot;&#x27;s release, Faye Hamlin left the group and was replaced by Janet Leon.

In 2004, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; was released, including the single &quot;everGirl,&quot; a tie-in to a Nickelodeon show that was never aired. They also re-recorded &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot; with Leon. Later that year, the Christmas album &quot;Play Around the Christmas Tree&quot; was released. It was Sundstrand&#x27;s final album with the group. After the band&#x27;s first split, Sundstrand moved to NYC after being signed to New York-based modeling agency Model Management Group (MMG).

=== Play reunion (2009–2011) ===
In 2009, Play announced their reunion with original members Hamlin and Anaïs Lameche, as well as new member Sanne Karlsson. Sundstrand was not part of the reunion: Lameche claimed she was unable to participate in the reunion as she lived in the United States. However, Sundstrand claimed that she had wanted to participate, but was told &quot;they did not want [her] included.&quot;

== Solo career (2005–present) ==
Since Play ended in 2005, Sundstrand was signed to Model Management Group (MMG) based in New York (the same agency her bandmate Rosanna Munter was signed). Sundstrand did some modeling for a while and even did some benefit fashion shows. However, in 2005 and 2006 Sundstrand performed around New York City with friend singer Chris Trousdale (who she previously worked with in Play).

Between 2005 and 2006, Sundstrand was back in the studio where she went to work recording her debut solo album. She recorded two solo songs, &quot;Say It Again&quot; and &quot;Press Rewind&quot; which she debuted during concerts with Trousdale. In 2006, the duo recorded a duet titled &quot;If Only&quot; which they recorded in Sweden. The music video for the song was released via their choreographer Claudia Swan&#x27;s YouTube account a few years after they filmed it.

In 2008, Sundstrand moved from New York to Los Angeles, California, where she starred in two indie films. &quot;Gone Astray&quot;, which was filmed in 2008. It is a horror, thriller, and religious film about a group of teens who go on a trip to find their inner faith and end up getting terrorized. Sundstrand starrs as Tara Nigel along with her friend and bandmate Chris Trousdale and Kaila Amariah (&quot;The Biggest Fan&quot;). In 2009, Sundstrand along with Kaila and &quot;7th Heaven&quot; actress Catherine Hicks starred the drama &quot;Split Second&quot;, which is about a girl who is trying to find out how a car accident that claimed her father&#x27;s life happened. Sundstrand stars as a police officer named Cathy. Both films were directed by Kaila&#x27;s father Michael Criscione. The films were scheduled for release sometime in 2010 but were put on hold.

In 2010, after moving back to New York, Sundstrand signed with DampCellar Music and released her debut solo single &quot;Brand New Me&quot; on iTunes. And, in February 2012 it was announced that Sundstrand was being represented by New York-based ColbyModels with which Sundstrand has worked closely for many years.

Currently, Sundstrand has moved back to Sweden where she is continuing with her solo music and writing a non-fiction book based on her life and her struggles as a child in the entertainment industry. In June 2018 Sundstrand announced that she has signed with a Sweden-based publishing company and that her book will be released worldwide in 2018. It has also been confirmed that she is working on new music. Sundstrand released her book &quot;Du Är Utybtbar&quot; in Sweden on 25 February 2020

== Personal life ==
Sundstrand has one older brother. She announced the birth of her first child, a daughter, born in November 2022, to fans on her Instagram page. In 2016, Sundstrand announced that she has been diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder called Addison&#x27;s Disease.

<text>Poul Kjærholm (1929–1980) was a Danish designer. Born in Østervrå, Denmark, Kjærholm began his career as a cabinetmaker&#x27;s apprentice with Gronbech in 1948, attending the Danish School of Arts and Crafts in Copenhagen in 1952. In 1953, he married Hanne Kjærholm who became a successful architect. While working as a designer, he also became an educator continuing studies with Prof. Erik Herløw and Prof. Palle Suenson.

==Life==

From the mid-1950s he worked for his friend Ejvind Kold Christiansen, for whom he produced an extensive range of his furniture. His distinctive style is evident as early as 1952 in his PKO minimalist plywood series. The PK61 coffee table of &#x27;55 is a playfully irrational supporting frame visible through the glass top.

In 1958 he attracted international acclaim for his contributions to the &#x27;Formes Scandinaves&#x27; exhibition in Paris and the award of the legendary &#x27;Lunning Award&#x27;, the same year for his PK22 chair. In both 1957 and 1960 he won the Grand Prize at the Milan Triennale.

In 1959 he became assistant at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen and lecturer.In 1965 his PK24 Chaise Longue typified his mature style. Its simple flowing lines combine steel and woven cane. In 1967 he was awarded the Danish ID Prize for product design.

He became head of the Institut for Design in 1973 and finally professor in 1976 until his death 4 years later.

==Works==

Most of his furniture was initially produced by his friend E. Kold Christensen in Hellerup. Since 1982 a wide selection of those products have been produced by Republic of Fritz Hansen, a leading Danish furniture manufacturing firm. His designs are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and other museum collections in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Germany.In typically Scandinavian fashion, most of Kjærholm’s contemporaries opted for wood as their primary furniture construction material. Kjærholm chose steel as his primary, but always combined it with other materials such as wood, leather, cane or marble. &quot;Steel’s constructive potential is not the only thing that interests me; the refraction of light on its surface is an important part of my artistic work. I consider steel a material with the same artistic merit as wood and leather,&quot; he commented.

He has been referred to as a “furniture architect” as he used functional models to make his finalized works. Furniture that he created between 1951 and 1980 has been described as “profound essays on the relationship between the body, materials, and space.”

In 2004, Kjærholm&#x27;s son established Kjærholm Productions to produce those items of his father&#x27;s furniture that Fritz Hansen had discontinued production of in 2003.

In 2008, Gregory R. Miller &amp; Co. published the comprehensive and definitive reference work, &quot;The Furniture of Poul Kjærholm: Catalogue Raisonné&quot;, by Michael Sheridan.

Some works:
*Lounge chair &quot;PK25&quot; (1951/52, production start in 1956): made on one single sheet of steel. cover done using sailing cord/rope like called &quot;flag halyard&quot;

<doc id="410201" wikidata="Q170504" url="?curid=410201" title="Pope John VIII">
<text>Pope John VIII (; died 16 December 882) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 14 December 872 to his death. He is often considered one of the ablest popes of the 9th century.

John devoted much of his papacy attempting to halt and reverse the Muslim gains in southern Italy and their march northwards. When his efforts to obtain assistance from either the Franks or the Byzantines failed, John strengthened the defences of Rome. He supported Methodius of Thessalonica in his mission to the Slavs, defended him against the Carolingian rulers and Bavarian clergy, and authorized the translation of the Bible into Slavonic. John also extended diplomatic recognition to the Duchy of Croatia and resolved the Photian schism. John&#x27;s pontificate ended with his assassination, and the papacy became significantly weaker in the aftermath.

==Slavonic liturgy==

Pope Adrian II consecrated Methodius of Thessalonica as archbishop and supported his mission to the Slavs. Unbeknownst to Rome, Methodius was imprisoned in 870 by the Carolingian King Louis the German and Bavarian bishops, who objected to his use of the Slavonic language in the liturgy and his encroachment on their jurisdiction in Moravia. Adrian II died in 872, and John VIII, a Roman native, was selected to succeed him. When Bishop Anno of Freising visited Rome, John inquired about the whereabouts of the missing Methodius, but Anno lied to him. In the summer of 873, John finally learned the truth. Furious, he forbade the celebration of mass in Bavaria until Methodius was released. After his release, Methodius came to Rome and convinced John to allow him to translate the Bible to Slavonic as well as to perform liturgy in Slavonic. John wrote: &quot;He who made three main languages – Hebrew, Greek, and Roman – also made all other languages to sing his praise and glory.&quot;

==Saracen incursions==
As a young man, John witnessed the Arab raid against Rome. Their expansion into Italy was severely affecting the economy of the Papal States. After the raids against Campania and the Sabine Hills, Pope John asked for military aid from Emperor Charles the Bald and later Count Boso of Provence. His efforts failed and he was forced to pay tribute to the Emirate of Sicily. The threatening Muslim military presence (which he believed was God&#x27;s punishment against &quot;bad Christians&quot;), coupled with alliances they formed with the local Christians, prompted John to promote &quot;a new and uncompromisingly hostile view of the Saracens.&quot; This included a ban on forming alliances with the Muslims. However, his efforts proved unsuccessful, partly because Christian leaders viewed his calls for unity as an excuse to assert papal authority in southern Italy.
In 876, John VIII traveled throughout Campania in an effort to form an alliance among the cities of Salerno, Capua, Naples, Gaeta and Amalfi against Muslim raids. By 877, all five cities sent delegates to Traietto to formalize an alliance. Pope John VIII urged Charles to come to his defence in Italy. Charles again crossed the Alps, but this expedition was received with little enthusiasm by the nobles, and even by his regent in Lombardy, Boso, and they refused to join his army. At the same time Carloman of Bavaria, son of Louis the German, entered northern Italy. Charles, ill and in great distress, started on his way back to Gaul, but died while crossing the pass of Mont Cenis on 6 October 877.

Obtaining relatively little support from outside sources, John fell back on what resources he could command. He reinforced the walls previously restored by Pope Leo IV. As the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls was located outside the Aurelian Walls, and had been damaged in a Saracen raid, the pope fortified the basilica, the monastery, and the nearby dwellings of the peasants. He also founded a papal fleet.

==Constantinople problems==
In 879, John recognised the reinstatement of Photios I as the legitimate patriarch of Constantinople. Photius had been condemned in 869 by Adrian II. This was undertaken mainly to appease the Byzantines, since in them he saw the only hope of removing the Arabs from Italy. It was commonly believed that some time afterward John VIII re-confirmed the excommunication of Photius, which eventually enabled Emperor Leo VI to move against Photius. However, modern scholarship particularly influenced by Catholic scholar Francis Dvornik has demonstrated this to be a Latin myth, as Photius died in visible perfect communion within the Roman Church.

John was anxious that the Duchy of Croatia would follow in the steps of Bulgaria, which had recently accepted the spiritual authority of Constantinople rather than that of Rome. After the overthrow of the pro-Byzantine Zdeslav in 879, John thanked the new duke, Branimir, for returning Croatia to papal jurisdiction. In return, John recognized Croatian independence from the Carolingians.

== Death ==
John VIII was assassinated in 882 by his own clerics; he was first poisoned, and then clubbed to death. The motives may have been his exhaustion of the papal treasury, his lack of support among the Carolingians, his gestures towards the Byzantines, and his failure to stop the Saracen raids. Without the protection of powerful magnates or the Carolingian emperor, the papacy after John VIII&#x27;s reign became increasingly subject to the machinations and greedy ambition of the rival clans of the local nobility.

<text>Amy Marcy Cheney Beach (September 5, 1867December 27, 1944) was an American composer and pianist. She was the first successful American female composer of large-scale art music. Her &quot;Gaelic&quot; Symphony, premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1896, was the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. She was one of the first American composers to succeed without the benefit of European training, and one of the most respected and acclaimed American composers of her era. As a pianist, she was acclaimed for concerts she gave featuring her own music in the United States and in Germany.

==Biography==

===Early years and musical education===
Amy Marcy Cheney was born in Henniker, New Hampshire, on September 5, 1867 to Charles Abbott Cheney (nephew of Oren B. Cheney, who co-founded Bates College) and Clara Imogene (Marcy) Cheney. Artistic ability ran in the family: Clara was reputedly an &quot;excellent pianist and singer,&quot; while Amy showed every sign of being a child prodigy. She was able to sing forty songs accurately by age one, she was capable of improvising counter-melody by age two, and she taught herself to read at age three. At four, she composed three waltzes for piano during one summer at her grandfather&#x27;s farm in West Henniker, NH, despite the absence of a piano; instead, she composed the pieces mentally and played them when she returned home. She could also play music by ear, including four-part hymns. These extraordinary musical talents at such a young age can be associated with certain innate conditions she possessed. Firstly, she may have possessed perfect pitch, which enabled her to play music entirely by ear. Additionally, she may have experienced synesthesia, a condition where each key was associated with a particular color. As a young girl, Beach would ask her parents to play music based on the color she associated the music with. For Beach, each key may have had a certain color. She did not have a color for every major key, and could only associate color with two minor keys. This heightened sensitivity to keys made playing by ear more feasible for her compared to musicians without such abilities. These inherent abilities not only defined her as a noteworthy prodigy but also fueled her desire for musical excellence. The family struggled to keep up with her musical interests and demands. Her mother sang and played for her, but attempted to prevent the child from playing the family piano herself, believing that to indulge the child&#x27;s wishes in this respect would damage parental authority. Amy often commanded what music was played in the home, becoming enraged if it did not meet her standards.

Amy Beach began formal piano lessons with her mother at age six, and soon gave public recitals of works by Handel, Beethoven, and Chopin, as well as her own pieces. One such recital was reviewed in arts journal &quot;The Folio,&quot; and multiple agents proposed concert tours for the young pianist, which her parents declined – a decision for which Beach was later grateful.

In 1875, the Cheney family moved to Chelsea, a suburb just across the Mystic River from Boston. They were advised there to enroll Amy in a European conservatory, but opted instead for local training, hiring Ernst Perabo and later Carl Baermann (himself a student of Franz Liszt) as piano teachers. In 1881–82, the fourteen-year-old also studied harmony and counterpoint with Junius W. Hill. This would be her only formal instruction as a composer, but &quot;[s]he collected every book she could find on theory, composition, and orchestration ... she taught herself ... counterpoint, harmony, fugue,&quot; even translating Gevaert&#x27;s and Berlioz&#x27;s French treatises on orchestration, considered &quot;most composers&#x27; bibles,&quot; into English for herself.

===Early career===
Amy Cheney made her concert debut at age sixteen on October 18, 1883, in a &quot;Promenade Concert&quot; conducted by Adolph Neuendorff at Boston&#x27;s Music Hall, where she played Chopin&#x27;s Rondo in E-flat and was piano soloist in Moscheles&#x27;s piano concerto No. 3 in G minor, to general acclaim: as biographer Fried Block comments, &quot;[i]t is hard to imagine a more positive critical reaction to a debut,&quot; and her audience was &quot;enthusiastic in the extreme.&quot; The next two years of her career included performances in Chickering Hall, and she starred in the final performance of the Boston Symphony&#x27;s 1884–85 season.

Beach would later recall one rehearsal for a Mendelssohn concerto in 1885, when the conductor slowed the orchestra during the last movement, attempting to go easy on the teenage soloist. When she began the piano part, however, she played at full prescribed tempo: &quot;I did not know that he was sparing me, but I did know that the tempo dragged, and I swung the orchestra into time&quot;.

===Marriage===
Beach was married the same year (1885) to Dr. Henry Harris Aubrey Beach (1843–1910)), a Boston surgeon, Harvard lecturer, and amateur singer twenty-four years her senior (she was eighteen at the time). Her name would subsequently be listed on concert programs and published compositions as &quot;Mrs. H. H. A. Beach.&quot;

The marriage was conditioned upon her willingness &quot;to live according to his status, that is, function as a society matron and patron of the arts. She agreed never to teach piano, an activity widely associated with women&quot; and regarded as providing &quot;pin money.&quot; She further agreed to limit performances to two public recitals per year, with profits donated to charity, and to devote herself more to composition than to performance (although, as she wrote, &quot;I thought I was a pianist first and foremost.&quot;) Her self-guided education in composition was also necessitated by Dr. Beach, who may have disapproved of his wife studying with a tutor. Restrictions like these were typical for middle- and upper-class women of the time: as it was explained to a European counterpart, Fanny Mendelssohn, &quot;Music will perhaps become his [Fanny&#x27;s brother Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s] profession, while for &quot;you&quot; it can and must be only an ornament.&quot;.

In recollecting her married life in 1942, Beach stated, &quot;I was happy and he was content&quot; and &quot;I belonged to a happy period that may never come again.&quot; Performing in Germany after Henry&#x27;s death in 1910, she dropped the &quot;Mrs. H. H. A.&quot; for &quot;Amy&quot;, apparently because the &quot;Mrs.&quot; mystified German audiences, but thereafter she used Mrs. H. H. A. Beach for the rest of her life.

===Rise to prominence===
A major compositional success came with her Mass in E-flat major, which was performed in 1892 by the Handel and Haydn Society orchestra, which since its foundation in 1815 had never performed a piece composed by a woman. Newspaper music critics responded to the Mass by declaring Beach one of America&#x27;s foremost composers, comparing the piece to Masses by Cherubini and Bach.
Beach followed this up with an important milestone in music history: her Gaelic Symphony, the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. It premiered October 30, 1896, performed by the Boston Symphony &quot;with exceptional success,&quot; although &quot;whatever the merits or defects of the symphony were thought to be, critics went to extraordinary lengths in their attempts to relate them to the composer&#x27;s sex.&quot; Composer George Whitefield Chadwick (1854–1931) wrote to Beach that he and his colleague Horatio Parker (1863–1919) had attended the Gaelic Symphony&#x27;s premiere and much enjoyed it: &quot;I always feel a thrill of pride myself whenever I hear a fine work by any of us, and as such you will have to be counted in, whether you [like it] or not – one of the boys.&quot; These &quot;boys&quot; were a group of composers unofficially known as the Second New England School, and included not only Chadwick and Parker but also John Knowles Paine (1839–1926), Arthur Foote (1853–1937), and Edward MacDowell (1860–1908). With the addition of Beach, they collectively became known as the Boston Six, of whom Beach was the youngest.

In 1900, the Boston Symphony premiered Beach&#x27;s Piano Concerto, with the composer as soloist. It has been suggested that the piece suggests Beach&#x27;s struggles against her mother and husband for control of her musical life. In all, Beach was one of the first American women who received large popularity for composing symphonies.

===Widowhood, years in Europe===
Beach&#x27;s husband died in June 1910 (the couple had been childless) and her mother 7 months later. Her father, Charles Cheney, had died in 1895. Beach felt unable to work for a while. She went to Europe in hopes of recovering there. In Europe she changed her name to &quot;Amy Beach&quot;. She travelled together with Marcella (Marcia) Craft, an American soprano who was &quot;prima donna of the Berlin Royal Opera.&quot; Beach&#x27;s first year in Europe &quot;was of almost entire rest.&quot; In 1912 she gradually resumed giving concerts, Her European debut was in Dresden, October 1912, playing her violin and piano sonata with violinist &quot;Dr. Bülau,&quot; to favorable reviews.
In Munich in January 1913, she gave a concert, again with her violin sonata, but with three sets of songs: two of her own and one by Brahms, and solo piano music by Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms. Two critics were rather unfavorable, one calling Beach&#x27;s songs &quot;kitschy.&quot; She was unfazed, saying the audience was &quot;large and very enthusiastic.&quot; Demand arose for sheet music of Beach&#x27;s songs and solo piano pieces, beyond the supply that Beach&#x27;s publisher Arthur P. Schmidt had available for German music stores. Later In January, still in Munich, she performed in her Piano Quintet; a critic praised her composing, which he did not like all that well, more than her playing. In a further concert in Breslau, only three of Beach&#x27;s songs were on the program, fewer than in Munich.

In November–December 1913 she played the solo part in her Piano Concerto with orchestras in Leipzig, Hamburg, and Berlin. Her Gaelic Symphony was also performed in Hamburg and Leipzig. A Hamburg critic wrote &quot;we have before us undeniably a possessor of musical gifts of the highest kind; a musical nature touched with genius.&quot; She was greeted as the first American woman &quot;able to compose music of a European quality of excellence.&quot;

===Return to America and later life===
Beach returned to America in 1914, not long after the beginning of World War I. Beach and Craft made pro-German statements to the American press, but Beach said her allegiance was to &quot;the musical, not the militaristic Germany.&quot; She gave some manuscripts of music she had written in Europe to Craft, who brought them back to the U.S. Beach delayed her own departure until September 1914 and so had a further trunkful of manuscripts confiscated at the Belgian border. Beach eventually recovered the trunk and contents in 1929.

In 1915, the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco commemorated the opening of the Panama Canal and the city&#x27;s recovery from the 1906 earthquake and fire. Amy Beach was honored often by concerts of her music and receptions during 1915, and her &quot;Panama Hymn&quot; was commissioned for the occasion. In 1915, and again in 1916, Beach visited her aunt Franc and cousin Ethel in San Francisco, who by then were her closest living relatives. About August 6, 1916, Beach, Franc, and Ethel left San Francisco together, leaving Franc&#x27;s husband Lyman Clement behind, a &quot;fifty-year-old marriage broken apart&quot; for unknown reasons. The three women took up residence in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, where Franc and Beach&#x27;s mother had been born. Beach&#x27;s uncle, Clement, &quot;was settled&quot; in a Veterans&#x27; Home in California from 1917 until his death in 1922. After 1916, &quot;Hillsborough was Beach&#x27;s official residence: there she voted in presidential elections.&quot; In 1918, her cousin Ethel &quot;developed a terminal illness,&quot; and she spent time taking care of her, as Franc, at age 75, &quot;could hardly&quot; do so by herself.

Aside from concert tours and the time of Ethel&#x27;s illness until her death in 1920, Beach also spent part of her time in New York City. Someone had asked her if she was the daughter of Mrs. H. H. A. Beach. She resumed using that married name, but used &quot;Amy Beach&quot; on bookplates and stationery. For a few summers, she composed at her cottage in Centerville, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.

While continuing to get income from her compositions published by Arthur P. Schmidt, during 1914–1921, she had new compositions published by G. Schirmer. The Centerville cottage had been built on a five-acre property Beach had bought with royalties from one song, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, 1892, her most successful composition up until then.

From 1921 on, she spent part of each summer as a Fellow at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, where she composed several works and encountered other women composers and/or musicians, including Emilie Frances Bauer, Marion Bauer, Mabel Wheeler Daniels, Fannie Charles Dillon, and Ethel Glenn Hier, who &quot;were or became long-time friends&quot; of Beach. But there were &quot;generational and gender divisions&quot; among the Fellows in music at the Macdowell Colony, with some feeling that Beach&#x27;s music was &quot;no longer fashionable&quot;.

In 1924, Beach sold the house in Boston she had inherited from her husband. Her aunt Franc had become &quot;feeble&quot; around 1920, developed dementia in 1924, and died in November 1925 in Hillsborough, after which Beach had no surviving relatives as close as Ethel and Franc had been. In the fall of 1930, Beach rented a studio apartment in New York. There, she became the virtual composer-in-residence at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church. Her music had been used during the previous 20 years in services at the church, attributed to &quot;H. H. A. Beach&quot;, with &quot;Mrs.&quot; added only since 1931.

She used her status as the top female American composer to further the careers of young musicians. While she had agreed not to give private music lessons while married, Beach was able to work as a music educator during the early 20th century. She served as President of the Board of Councillors of the New England Conservatory of Music. She worked to coach and give feedback to various young composers, musicians, and students. Beach acted as a mentor for these young composers, encouraging them to spend time perfecting their craft through laborious practices. Written in her document, &quot;Music’s Ten Commandments as Given for Young Composers,&quot; Beach suggested young musicians spare no time analyzing works from every genre, their technical progress, and to employ variety whenever possible. From 1904 to 1943, Beach published numerous articles focusing on programming, preparation, and studying techniques for serious piano players, basing many of her findings on her own practice routine. Given her status and advocacy for music education, she was in high demand as a speaker and performer for various educational institutions and clubs, such as the University of New Hampshire, where she received an honorary master&#x27;s degree in 1928. She also worked to create &quot;Beach Clubs,&quot; which helped teach and educate children in music. She served as leader of some organizations focused on music education and women, including the Society of American Women Composers as its first president.

Beach spent the winter and spring of 1928–29 in Rome. She went to concerts &quot;almost daily&quot; and found Respighi&#x27;s Feste Romane to be &quot;superbly brilliant,&quot; but disliked a piece by Paul Hindemith. In March 1929 she gave a concert to benefit the American Hospital in Rome, in which her song &quot;The Year&#x27;s at the Spring&quot; was encored and a &quot;large sum of money&quot; was raised. Beach, like her friends in Rome, briefly became an admirer of the Italian dictator Mussolini. She returned to the United States with a two-week stopover in Leipzig, where she met her old friend, the singer Marcella Craft. In 1942, Boston sculptor Bashka Paeff created a bust of her as a commission by the League of American Pen-Women. The piece was donated to Washington&#x27;s Phillips Collection.

She was a member of Chapter R (New York City) of the P.E.O. Sisterhood. Late in her life, she collaborated on the &quot;Ballad of P.E.O.&quot; with the words written by Ruth Comfort Mitchell, Chapter BZ/California. Heart disease led to Beach&#x27;s retirement in 1940, around the time of which she was honored at a testimonial dinner by 200 of her friends in New York. Beach died in New York City in 1944. Amy Beach is buried with her husband in the Forest Hills Cemetery in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.

==Compositions==

Beach was a member of the &quot;Second New England School&quot; or &quot;Boston Group&quot;; the other members were composers John Knowles Paine, Arthur Foote, George Chadwick, Edward MacDowell, George Whiting, and Horatio Parker. Her writing is mainly in a Romantic idiom, often compared to that of Brahms or Rachmaninoff. In her later works she experimented, moving away from tonality, employing whole tone scales and more exotic harmonies and techniques.

Beach&#x27;s compositions include a one-act opera, &quot;Cabildo&quot;, and a variety of other works.

===Symphonic works===
Beach wrote the &quot;Gaelic Symphony&quot; (1896) and the Piano Concerto in C-sharp minor (1898−99). Another orchestral piece, &quot;Bal masque&quot;, has a solo piano version. Two further pieces, &quot;Eilende Wolken&quot; and &quot;Jephthah&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, are for orchestra with voice.

===Choral works===
Beach&#x27;s sacred choral works are mainly for four voices and organ, but a few are for voices and orchestra, two being the Mass in E-flat major (1892) and her setting of St. Francis&#x27;s Canticle of the Sun (1924, 1928), first performed at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s in New York. A setting of the Te Deum with organ was first performed by the choir of men and boys at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Boston. The Capitol Hill Choral Society of Washington, D.C., recorded the Canticle of the Sun, seven Communion Responses, and other pieces by Beach in 1998, led by its Musical Director Betty Buchanan, who founded the Society in 1983.

There are some tens of secular choral works, accompanied by orchestra, piano, or organ. Publisher Arthur P. Schmidt once complained to Beach that her &quot;choral pieces had practically no sale&quot;.

===Chamber music===
Beach&#x27;s chamber music compositions include a violin sonata (recorded on seven different labels), a romance and three further pieces for violin and piano, a piano trio, a string quartet, and a piano quintet.

Of the over 300 works by Amy Beach which were published during her lifetime and included almost every genre, the largest category is her art songs and vocal chamber music. Beyond these, she wrote many chamber works and transcriptions for piano, including &quot;Variations on Balkan Themes&quot;, Beach&#x27;s &quot;longest and most important solo&quot; piano work, which was composed in 1904, in response to revolts in the Balkans against the then ruling Ottoman Empire. Twelve are instrumental chamber works. One notable aspect of Beach&#x27;s musicianship was her role as a virtuoso pianist, in which she regularly performed both her own compositions and those of others. She toured extensively in Germany, New England, and all the way to the Pacific Coast, where she brought European-American concert music to the western states. Among two of Beach&#x27;s most frequently performed instrumental works are the Sonata in A Minor for Piano and Violin, Op. 34 and the Quintet in F♯ minor, Op. 67, as both were programmed extensively in the United States and Germany. Another noteworthy work which illustrates Beach&#x27;s skill and adherence to tradition as a composer is her String Quartet, Op. 89.

==== Sonata in A minor for piano and violin, Op. 34 ====
In January 1897 Beach played with Franz Kneisel the premiere of her Sonata for Piano and Violin, Op. 34, which she had composed in the spring of 1896. Franz Kneisel was a leading violinist in Boston and beyond, having been hired at about age 20 by Wilhelm Gericke, conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, as concertmaster of the orchestra. Soon after arriving in Boston, he formed the Kneisel String Quartet with three other string players of the Boston Symphony. (The Quartet lasted until 1917. Meanwhile, Kneisel moved to New York in 1905.) In 1894 Beach had joined the quartet in performing Robert Schumann&#x27;s Piano Quintet in E-flat, Op. 44. The Sonata is written in four movements, which are interconnected musically by using the first movement&#x27;s opening theme as a germinating source to be developed on in the following three. They are thoroughly crafted to follow conventions of the form while implementing each musical element in a precise and well-constructed way.

The premiere was quickly followed by several other recital performances of the piece in various New York cities, where critical reception was mixed; some reviewers described the piece as immature and lacking in substance, although they acknowledged her skillful use of contrapuntal movement and affective principal themes. The third movement, &quot;Largo con dolore,&quot; was the most controversial among critics, with some praising its beauty and passionately evocative nature, while others derided its length as being too far extended and monotonous. Audiences, however, were captivated and spellbound by the slow movement; at one performance it was reported that they broke out into enthusiastic applause in between the third and fourth movements out of an abundance of emotion. In Europe, the piece was generally well received. The composer and pianist Teresa Carreño performed the piece with violinist Carl Halir in Berlin, October 1899 and wrote to Beach:I assure you that I never had a greater pleasure in my life than the one I had in working out your beautiful sonata and having the good luck to bring it before the German public...(I)t really met with a &quot;decided success&quot; and this is said to the credit of the public.Reviewers in Berlin were fairly positive in their response to the Sonata, hailing its technical development and brilliant use of the violin and piano as individual parts. Where criticized, they noted that it was perhaps too virtuosic for chamber music, while another reviewer for the &quot;Berliner Volks-Zeitung&quot; characterized Beach&#x27;s compositional style as being too derivative of Schumann and Brahms—yet allowed Beach&#x27;s gender as a caveat for this supposed shortcoming (sexism was common and extreme in classical music). He wrote:In style, she is not individual; her dependence upon Schumann and Brahms is unmistakable, which is a weakness, for which the feminine character furnishes ground and excuse. The sonata is sonorous and graceful in both violin and piano parts, though the latter in the last movement somewhat oversteps the allotted bounds of chamber music.

==== Quintet in F-sharp minor for Piano and Strings, Op. 67 ====
In 1900, with the Kneisel Quartet, Beach performed the Brahms Piano Quintet in F minor, Op. 34. Beach wrote her own three-movement Quintet for Piano and Strings in F-sharp minor, Op. 67, in 1905. The quintet came to be frequently performed during Beach&#x27;s lifetime, both in concert and over the radio. These performances were often given by established string quartets accompanied by the pianist-composer, including many times during an extended tour with the Kneisel Quartet in 1916–17, which was the 33rd and last season for the quartet. Beach performed her quintet with them in Boston, Brooklyn, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

Among all of Beach&#x27;s chamber works, this work has been described as one of the most distinctly representative of a Brahmsian influence in her music, from the jagged chromatic melody and contrasting lyrical passages, irregularly phrase lengths, its key changes and lush texture, to its strict adherence to the sonata-allegro form. The primary theme throughout all three works, in fact, is borrowed from the last movement of the Brahms quintet, albeit adapted and reworked in a variety of ways. All three movements feature frequent distinct developments in meter, tempo, and key signature. The entire work carries an affective character of lamentation throughout, demonstrated not only by the overall emotive qualities of the work itself but also its use of the Phrygian tetrachord cadence frequently associated with mourning, which in this work outlines the notes F#-E-D-C#.

Generally speaking, the work was received quite well by audiences and reviewers as belonging to an important compositional tradition. Critics noted its aesthetically flexible imagination while adhering to traditional expectations, bringing a variety of expressive moods and tone colors to a work of substantial form. They also commented on the modernity and skill the work displayed in that it achieved a highly expressive nature and orchestral texture while maintaining the intimate, technically developed character of the chamber ensemble voicing. This work added to her reputation as a composer of serious high art music, although still deemed slightly beneath the works of similar male composers by some reviewers.

==== String Quartet, Op. 89 ====
Beach&#x27;s String Quartet is a single movement and is one of her more mature works. It was originally labeled as Op. 79, but over the course of a decade, the work evolved, and Beach finally re-designated the piece as Op. 89 in 1929. The significance Beach bestowed on this piece is notable, given that it did not feature a piano part which she would perform, as did many of her other works. Because of the timing of the piece&#x27;s composition, there is some evidence that Beach may have been inspired to write the work as part of Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge&#x27;s chamber music competition in 1922. Numerous painstaking attempts demonstrate both Beach&#x27;s devotion to the composition of this piece and her unfamiliarity with writing in this genre. The final work, completed in Rome, consists of a single movement divided into three sections, and thematically speaking, follows an arch form (A B C B1 A1). The piece uses three different Eskimo or Inuit melodies throughout the work: &quot;Summer Song&quot;, &quot;Playing at Ball&quot;, and &quot;Itataujang&#x27;s Song&quot;, taken from Franz Boas&#x27; book on the Alaskan Inuit tribes. Beach integrates these borrowed tunes within a framework of Austro-Germanic extended quasi-tonality and dissonance, first through more straightforward statements of the melodies and then as assimilated into a horizontal harmonic structure. Elements of the melodies are abstracted and developed into contrapuntal lines which propel the work forward in the absence of clear tonal direction. The texture and harmony is fairly stark in places, lacking the lush Romanticism of her earlier works and representing more Modernist inclinations of a developing composer.

The piece was premiered at the American Academy in April 1929, but Beach reported little on whether or not this performance was satisfactory. Nonetheless, it was followed by a number of private performances and small recitals in New York, Cincinnati, and Massachusetts. A 1937 performance arranged by Roy Harris was particularly disappointing, as the performers were ill-prepared and sight-read the work poorly. No performance of the quartet was fully satisfactory to Beach, and the work did not gain the recognition that she seemed to hope it would gather.

Because the quartet was so different from many of Beach&#x27;s previous works, and given that Beach was unable to perform it herself, there is little known concerning both audience and critic response to the piece. Composer and biographer Burnet Corwin Tuthill offered praise of it, saying that while it was unusual for Beach and lacked the emotionalism usually prevalent in her music, it demonstrated remarkable technical sophistication and skill in its handling of both string writing and engagement with thematic material that was not European in origin. In fact, Beach&#x27;s use of Inuit and Native American tunes became a marked feature in several of her other works, which she used as a means of bringing stylistic modernity to her sound through the appropriation and recontextualization of these melodies.

===Songs===
Beach was most popular for her about 150 songs. The words of about five each are her own and those of H. H. A. Beach, for the rest by other poets. &quot;The Year&#x27;s At the Spring&quot; from &quot;Three Browning Songs, Op. 44&quot; is perhaps Beach&#x27;s best-known work. Despite the volume and popularity of the songs during her lifetime, no single-composer collection of Beach&#x27;s songs exists. Some may be purchased through Hildegard Publishing Company and Masters Music Publication, Inc.

In the early 1890s, Beach started to become interested in folk songs. She shared that interest with several of her colleagues, and this interest soon came to be the first nationalist movement in American music. Beach&#x27;s contributions included about thirty songs inspired by folk music, including Scottish, Irish, Balkan, African-American, and Native American origins.

==Writings==
Beach was a musical intellectual who wrote for journals, newspapers, and other publications. She gave advice to young musicians and composers – especially female composers. From career to piano technique advice, Beach readily provided her opinions in articles such as &quot;To the Girl who Wants to Compose&quot; and &quot;Emotion Versus Intellect in Music.&quot; In 1915, she had written &quot;Music’s Ten Commandments as Given for Young Composers&quot;, which expressed many of her self-teaching principles.

==Late 20th century and early 21st century revival and reception==
Despite her fame and recognition during her lifetime, Beach was largely neglected after her death in 1944 until the late 20th century. Efforts to revive interest in Beach&#x27;s works have been largely successful during the last few decades.

===Gaelic Symphony===
The symphony has received praise from modern critics, such as Andrew Achenbach of &quot;Gramophone&quot;, who in 2003 lauded the work for its &quot;big heart, irresistible charm and confident progress.&quot; In 2016, Jonathan Blumhofer of &quot;The Arts Fuse&quot; wrote: To my ears, it is by far the finest symphony by an American composer before Ives and, by a wide margin, better than a lot that came after him. It surely is the most exciting symphony penned by an American before World War I. [...] Her command of instrumentation throughout the Symphony was consistently excellent and colorful. The manner in which she balanced content and form succeeds where her contemporaries like George Whitefield Chadwick, John Knowles Paine, and Horatio Parker so often came up short: somehow Beach’s Symphony is never daunted by the long shadows Brahms and Beethoven cast across the Atlantic. It’s a fresh, invigorating, and personal statement in a genre that has offered plenty of examples of pieces that demonstrate none of those qualities.

===Piano Concerto===
Beach&#x27;s Piano Concerto has been praised as an overlooked masterwork by modern critics. In 1994, Phil Greenfield of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; called it &quot;a colorful, dashing work that might become extremely popular if enough people get a chance to hear it. In 2000 Joshua Kosman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; also lauded the composition, writing:

Andrew Achenbach of &quot;Gramophone&quot; similarly declared it &quot;ambitious&quot; and &quot;singularly impressive... a rewarding achievement all round, full of brilliantly idiomatic solo writing ... lent further autobiographical intrigue by its assimilation of thematic material from three early songs&quot;.

===Tributes and memorials===
In 1994, the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail placed a bronze plaque at her Boston address, and in 1995, Beach&#x27;s gravesite at Forest Hills Cemetery was dedicated. In 1999, she was put into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 2000, the Boston Pops paid tribute by adding her name as the first woman joining 87 other composers on the granite wall of Boston&#x27;s Hatch Shell.
In honor of Beach&#x27;s 150th birthday Marty Walsh, Mayor of the City of Boston, declared September 5, 2017, to be &quot;Amy Beach Day.&quot; Also commemorating Beach&#x27;s sesquicentennial, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article by William Robin, &quot;Amy Beach, a Pioneering American Composer, Turns 150&quot;.

<doc id="410206" wikidata="Q1850580" url="?curid=410206" title="Hambleden">
<text>Hambleden is a small village and civil parish in southwest Buckinghamshire, England. The village is around west of Marlow, and around northeast of Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.

The civil parish also includes the villages of Fingest and Frieth, and the hamlets of Colstrope, Mill End, Parmoor, Pheasant&#x27;s Hill and Skirmett. At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 1,445.

== History ==
The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and means &#x27;crooked or irregularly-shaped hill&#x27;. It was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Hanbledene&quot;, though previously in 1015 it was known as &quot;Hamelan dene&quot;. St Thomas Cantilupe, the Lord Chancellor and Bishop of Hereford, was born in Hambleden in 1218. In 1315 a Royal charter was granted to hold a market in the village, and a fair on St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day (24 August) every year. The charter was reconfirmed in 1321, though appears to have not lasted much longer than this.

The village was a base for US soldiers during the buildup to D-Day in 1944.

=== Parish ===
Hambleden was a large ancient parish, covering the area of the modern civil parish except for the village of Fingest. It extended over , stretching to Skirmett, north of the village of Hambleden, and Frieth north-east of the village. The ancient parish became a civil parish in 1866. In 1934 a small area in the north of the parish was transferred to the parish of Fingest and Lane End. In the 1980s the village of Fingest was added to the parish when the parish of Fingest and Lane End was abolished.

== Village and church ==
The brick and flint cottages in the centre of the village conform to a similar design and have dormer windows topped with red tiles. Saint Mary the Virgin&#x27;s church dates from the 14th century and includes a conspicuous memorial to Cope D&#x27;Oyley (who died in 1633) and his family. The tower contains eight bells and the ceiling is quite intricately decorated in parts. The post office in the village serves also as the local shop and café.

== Manor house ==
The Elizabethan manor house opposite the church, formerly the home of Maria Carmela Viscountess Hambleden, was built in 1603 of flint and brick for Emanuel, 11th Baron Scrope, who became Earl of Sunderland. Charles I stayed there overnight in 1646 while fleeing from Oxford. The Manor House, Hambleden is also the former home of James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan who led the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade. Another notable (Listed Grade II*) building is Kenricks which overlooks the cricket ground and was the previous manor house and the home of Philadelphia Scrope, a cousin and Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Elizabeth I. On her death in 1627 it became The Rectory and was altered in 1724 by the Rector Rev Dr Scawen Kenrick. It ceased to be The Rectory in 1938 and was acquired by the 3rd Viscount Hambleden and renamed Kenricks.

==Yewden villa excavation==
Yewden, an archaeological site consisting of the remains of a Roman villa, was discovered to the south of Hambleden in 1912. A contested theory was put forward by Jill Eyers from Chiltern Archaeology in 2010 that a military brothel might have formed part of the Yewden villa site, after archaeologists discovered skeletal remains of what appeared to be 97 newborn babies. The investigation features in the inaugural part of the archaeology series, &quot;Digging for Britain&quot; presented by Dr Alice Roberts. The first part of the second series promised to resolve some of the controversy.

In 2012, an alternate theory for the presence of the infant skeletons was put forward; as the skeletons showed signs of cut marks carried out using a non-serrated blade, features consistent of embryotomy procedures used to remove deceased fetuses in breech position, it was argued that the remains may indicate that obstetric surgeries were carried out at Yewden.

== Notable residents ==
Saint Thomas Cantilupe was born in the old Manor House (now Kenricks) in 1218. He became Chancellor of Oxford University, Bishop of Hereford and Lord Chancellor of England. He was canonised by Pope John XXII in 1320 and was the last Englishman to be canonised before the Reformation. Thomas D&#x27;Oylie (died 1603), physician and linguist, was the uncle of Sir Cope D&#x27;Oylie, whose memorial can be seen in the church of St. Mary the Virgin. The Hambleden Estate was held by the Scrope family from 1365 to 1627; Philadelphia Carey, Lady Scrope was a granddaughter of Mary Boleyn, the sister of Queen Anne Boleyn who was executed by Henry VIII in 1536. 

Lord Cardigan, famous for his role in leading the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade, was born in the Manor House in 1797. The sea chest that he took to the Crimea can be seen in the church. The Estate was acquired in 1925 by Frederick Smith, 2nd Viscount Hambleden, who owned the adjoining Greenlands Estate. The Smith family sold the western part of the Estate in 2008 to the Swiss financier Urs Schwarzenbach.

Major General Miles Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk, lived in the parish until his death in 2002 and his widow Anne continued to live there. Roger Marquis, 2nd Earl of Woolton lived at Kenricks in the 1960s. Musician Jon Lord, of Deep Purple, lived at Yewden Lodge in Hambleden and is buried in Saint Mary&#x27;s churchyard. Phil Vickery, London Wasps player and England 2003 World Cup Winner, lived in Hambleden

==Localities==

===Mill End===
Mill End is the southern small hamlet in the civil parish on the main A4155 road between Henley-on-Thames and Marlow, by the River Thames. Mill End consists of 32 houses, some on the river bank and others on the northern side of the main road. The largest historic home is at the heart of its cluster of buildings, Yewden Manor, listed grade II for architecture.

The name clearly comes from the mill that is situated near the lock, on the fast-flowing, narrow, high-sided Hambleden Bourne, which discharges here. Mill End Farm, which has been run by the Bowden family since at least 1965, is opposite the lock and has farmed most of the land in and around the southern Hambleden area. This part of the Thames is characterised by willow trees and a large biodiversity of wildlife including mute swans, great crested grebes, ducks, grey herons, common terns and kingfishers. The footpath next to Hambleden Lock, the public towpath, provides a significant amenity to Mill End.

Anne Petrie, daughter of the famous Egyptian archaeologist Flinders Petrie lived in Mill End; she is buried in Hambleden church-yard.

=== Landmarks ===
In the Mill End part of the village are a watermill, lock and villa. Adjacent to the converted barns and the ordinary home named Mill House, which had served for centuries as home to the moderately wealthy miller of the district, is the much larger, often-photographed Hambleden Mill, which has been converted into flats; this is downstream of a pedestrianised weir from Hambleden Lock.

The site of an unusually immediately Thameside Roman villa adjoins the east of the development.

In Ridge Wood atop the hill opposite the village is a large avenue of giant sequoia and tall pine trees.

===Nearby by the Thames===
Henley Management College lies west and is also on the Thames.

Danesfield House, a hotel and spa is east of the village on a hillside of the same relatively steep bank.

==In popular culture==
Hambleden Lock is mentioned in Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s novel &quot;Three Men In A Boat&quot;.

=== Filming location ===

The village has only one shop-cum-Post Office, and other properties have facades that are more in keeping with a traditional country village. This has long made it a popular shooting location for films, including &quot;The Captive Heart&quot; (1946), &quot;The Witches&quot; (1966), &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978),&quot;The Legacy&quot; (1979), &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (1981), &quot;Dance with a Stranger&quot; (1985), &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1996), &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1999), &quot;Into The Woods&quot; (2014) and &quot;Disenchanted&quot; (2022). It was also used in the opening scenes of the remake of &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1998).

===Television===

Hambleden was used in the HBO mini-series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; to depict Easy Company&#x27;s training in England. In 1979 Hambleden church was the setting for a programme featuring Harry Secombe called &quot;Cross on the Donkey&#x27;s Back&quot;. It was an Easter programme by Thames Television and also featured a group of school children from Hambleden C of E School. 

The 2010 film &quot;Nanny McPhee Returns&quot; also used parts of the village in some of their scenes. The church was also used in the &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; episode &quot;Sad Cypress&quot;. In 2017, Hambleden was the location for the fictional village of Bramford in the fourth episode of series 4 of the ITV detective drama &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Hambleden played the role of Tadfield, home of the Anti-Christ and his friends, in the 2019 mini-series &quot;Good Omens&quot;.

<doc id="410210" wikidata="Q254798" url="?curid=410210" title="Deborah Lipstadt">
<text>Deborah Esther Lipstadt (born March 18, 1947) is an American historian and diplomat, best known as author of the books &quot;Denying the Holocaust&quot; (1993), &quot;History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier&quot; (2005), &quot;The Eichmann Trial&quot; (2011), and &quot;&quot; (2019). She served as the United States Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism from 2022 to 2025. Since 1993 she has been the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish History and Holocaust Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, US.

Lipstadt was a consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 1994, President of the United States Bill Clinton appointed her to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, and she served two terms. On July 30, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated her to be the United States Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism. She was confirmed by voice-vote on March 30, 2022, and sworn in on May 3, 2022. She served in that position until January 2025. Lipstadt was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2023.

==Life and career==
Lipstadt was born in New York City to a Jewish family, the daughter of Miriam (née Peiman; 1915–2013) and Erwin Lipstadt (1903–1972). Her mother was born in Canada, and her father, a salesman, was born in Germany. Her parents met at their neighborhood synagogue. She has an older sister, Helene, a historian, and a younger brother, Nathaniel, an investor on Wall Street.

In her youth, she studied at the Hebrew Institute of Long Island, and grew up in Far Rockaway, Queens. She studied with Rabbi Emanuel Rackman at Temple Shaarei Tefillah. Lipstadt spent summers at Camp Massad.

She spent her junior year of college — which turned out to include the Six-Day War — in Israel, where she stayed as an exchange student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She completed a Bachelor of Arts in American history at the City College of New York in 1969. She then enrolled at Brandeis University where she completed her master&#x27;s degree in 1972 and then her Ph.D. in Near Eastern and Judaic Studies in 1976. Her doctoral dissertation was entitled &quot;The Zionist Career of Louis Lipsky, 1900–1921&quot;.

After receiving her Ph.D., Lipstadt began teaching, first at the University of Washington in Seattle from 1974 to 1979, then as an assistant professor at UCLA. When she was denied tenure there, she left in 1985 to be the director of the independent Brandeis-Bardin Institute for two years, during which time she also wrote a monthly column for &quot;The Jewish Spectator&quot;. Lipstadt then received a research fellowship from the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, during which she studied Holocaust denial, and taught at Occidental College part time.

Lipstadt then became an assistant professor of religion at Emory University in Atlanta in January 1993, becoming the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies that fall. She helped to create the Institute for Jewish Studies there.

===US Antisemitism Envoy===
In May 2021, Lipstadt was considered for an ambassadorship position at the Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism in the Biden administration.

On July 30, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Lipstadt for this role. Opposition from Senator Ron Johnson, whom she had tweeted was advocating &quot;white supremacy/nationalism&quot;, delayed her nomination for many months. Her initial nomination expired at the end of the year and was returned to President Biden on January 3, 2022.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on her nomination on February 8, 2022. On March 29, 2022, the committee favorably reported her nomination out of committee. Her nomination was supported by all committee Democrats, as well as senators Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio. It was confirmed by voice vote on March 30, 2022, and she was sworn in on May 3, 2022.

Lipstadt was part of the Biden administration team that launched the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism on May 25, 2023.

On October 17, 2023, in a joint statement with Michal Cotler-Wunsh (Israel&#x27;s antisemitism envoy), published by the U.S. State Department, Lipstadt condemned the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.

In September 2024, Lipstadt attended the Jewish New Year ceremony at the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. with Israeli Ambassador Michael Herzog, Zioness founder Amanda Berman, and cybertechnology official Anne Neuberger.

==David Irving libel suit==
On September 5, 1996, author David Irving sued Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books for libel in an English court for characterizing some of his writings and public statements as Holocaust denial in her book &quot;Denying the Holocaust&quot;.

Lipstadt&#x27;s legal defense team was led by Anthony Julius of Mishcon de Reya while Penguin&#x27;s was led by Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman of Davenport Lyons. Both defendants instructed Richard Rampton QC, while Penguin also instructed Heather Rogers as junior counsel. The expert witnesses for the defence included Cambridge historian Richard J. Evans, Christopher Browning, Robert Jan van Pelt, and Peter Longerich.

English libel law places the burden of proof on the defendant rather than the plaintiff. using the justification defense, namely by demonstrating in court that Lipstadt&#x27;s accusations against Irving were substantially true and therefore not libelous. The case was argued as a bench trial before Mr Justice Gray, who produced a written judgment 349 pages long detailing Irving&#x27;s systematic distortion of the historical record of World War II. &quot;The Times&quot; (April 14, 2000, p. 23) said of Lipstadt&#x27;s victory, &quot;History has had its day in court and scored a crushing victory.&quot;

Despite her acrimonious history with Irving, Lipstadt has stated that she is personally opposed to the three-year prison sentence Austria imposed on Irving for two speeches he made in 1989, where he claimed there had been no gas chambers at Auschwitz. In Austria, minimizing the atrocities of the Third Reich is a crime punishable with up to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment. Speaking of Irving, Lipstadt said, &quot;I am uncomfortable with imprisoning people for speech. Let him go and let him fade from everyone&#x27;s radar screens ... Generally, I don&#x27;t think Holocaust denial should be a crime. I am a free speech person, I am against censorship.&quot;

==Commentary==
In February 2007, Lipstadt warned of &quot;soft-core denial&quot; at the Zionist Federation&#x27;s annual fundraising dinner in London. Referring to groups such as the Muslim Council of Britain, reportedly she stated: &quot;When groups of people refuse to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day unless equal time is given to anti-Muslim prejudice, this is soft-core denial.&quot; According to Jonny Paul, &quot;She received huge applause when she asked how former United States President Jimmy Carter could omit the years 1939–1947 from a chronology in his book&quot;; referring to his recently published and controversial book &quot;&quot;, she said: &quot;When a former president of the United States writes a book on the Israeli–Palestinian crisis and writes a chronology at the beginning of the book in order to help them understand the emergence of the situation and in that chronology lists nothing of importance between 1939 and 1947, that is soft-core denial.&quot;

Along the same lines, Lipstadt has criticized the German philosopher and historian Ernst Nolte for engaging in what she calls &quot;soft-core denial&quot; of the Holocaust, arguing that Nolte practices an even more dangerous form of negationism than the Holocaust deniers. Speaking of Nolte in a 2003 interview, Lipstadt stated:

In late 2011, Lipstadt attacked American and Israeli politicians for what she called their invocation of the Holocaust for contemporary political purposes, something she thought mangled history. She rebuked Republican Party presidential candidates for speeches that &#x27;pandered&#x27; to the Evangelical constituency, as much as it did to the Republican Jewish Coalition. She also judged Howard Gutman&#x27;s remarks on causal links between Muslim antisemitism and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as &quot;stupid&quot;. According to &quot;Haaretz&quot;, &quot;She decried the &#x27;hysteria&#x27; and &#x27;neuroses&#x27; of many Jews and Israelis who compare the current situation in Europe and in the Middle East to the Holocaust-era&quot;:

In the same interview, she argued that &quot;If anti-Semitism becomes the reason through which your Jewish view of the world is refracted, if it becomes your prism, then it is very unhealthy. Jewish tradition never wanted that.&quot; She said &quot;You listen to Newt Gingrich talking about the Palestinians as an &#x27;invented people&#x27;—it&#x27;s out-Aipacking AIPAC, it&#x27;s out-Israeling Israel&quot;. On a visit to London in September 2014, Lipstadt criticized the Israeli government and said that the government had &quot;cheapened&quot; the memory of the Holocaust by using it to justify war. She has also rejected the view that Israeli military actions during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict constituted a genocide.

Lipstadt returned to the theme of soft-core Holocaust denial in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; when responding to the Trump administration&#x27;s statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, January 27, 2017, which was condemned for the absence of a specific mention of Jews, as the principal victims of the Holocaust or of antisemitism itself. &quot;The Holocaust was de-Judaized. It is possible that it all began with a mistake. Someone simply did not realize what they were doing. It is also possible that someone did this deliberately.&quot;

In February 2019, Lipstadt resigned her membership in the Young Israel synagogue movement because its national council president defended Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s facilitation of a merger between the Bayit Yehudi party and the extremist Otzma Yehudit party.

In October 2019, Lipstadt had a letter to the editor published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, prompted by the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Peter Handke, in which she wrote that the Nobel Committee awarded Handke a platform &quot;he does not deserve&quot; and that &quot;the public does not need him to have&quot;, adding that such a platform could convince some that his &quot;false claims must have some legitimacy&quot;.

In September 2024, she came under criticism by CAIR over a joke made about the 2024 Lebanon pager explosions.

==Awards and honors==
After the publication of &quot;Denying the Holocaust&quot; in June 1993, Lipstadt received the 1994 National Jewish Book Award. Already a consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, President Bill Clinton appointed her in 1994 to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. In 1997, Lipstadt received the Emory Williams teaching award for excellence in teaching. She is also a recipient of the Albert D. Chernin Award from the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, which is given to &quot;an American Jew whose work best exemplifies the social justice imperatives of Judaism, Jewish history and the protection of the Bill of Rights, particularly the First Amendment.&quot; Previous recipients of the Award include Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Alan Dershowitz. Lipstadt was awarded the 2005 National Jewish Book Award in the Holocaust category for &quot;History on Trial: My Day in Court with a Holocaust Denier&quot; &quot;and the&quot; 2019 National Jewish Book Award in Education and Jewish Identity for &quot;Antisemitism: Here and Now.&quot;

Lipstadt has received honorary doctorates from a number of institutions, including Ohio Wesleyan University, John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of New York, Yeshiva University, and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, among others.

<text>Samuel Taliaferro Rayburn (January 6, 1882 – November 16, 1961) was an American politician who served as the 43rd speaker of the United States House of Representatives. He was a three-time House speaker, former House majority leader, two-time House minority leader, and a 24-term congressman, representing Texas&#x27;s 4th congressional district as a Democrat from 1913 to 1961. He holds the record for the longest tenure as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, serving for over 17 years (among his three separate tenures).

Born in Roane County, Tennessee, Rayburn moved with his family to Windom, Texas, in 1887. After a period as a school teacher, Rayburn won election to the Texas House of Representatives and graduated from the University of Texas School of Law. He won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1912 and continuously won re-election until his death in 1961, serving a total of 25 terms. Rayburn was a protégé of John Nance Garner and a mentor to Lyndon B. Johnson.

Rayburn was elected House Majority Leader in 1937 and was elevated to the position of Speaker of the House after the death of William B. Bankhead. He led the House Democrats from 1940 to 1961, and served as Speaker of the House from 1940 to 1947, 1949 to 1953, and 1955 to 1961. Rayburn also served twice as House Minority Leader (1947 to 1949 and 1953 to 1955) during periods of Republican House control. He preferred to work quietly in the background and successfully used his power of persuasion and charisma to get his bills passed due to having to navigate the post-Joseph Cannon era when each individual committee chairman had immense power in the House.

Along with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson and most of the Texan Representatives, Rayburn refused to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto and helped shepherd the passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, the first civil rights bills passed by the U.S. Congress since the Enforcement Acts and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 during Reconstruction (1865–1877). Rayburn was also influential in the construction of U.S. Route 66. He served as Speaker until his death in 1961, and was succeeded by John W. McCormack. He is the most recent Speaker of the House to die in office.

== Early life ==
Rayburn was born in Roane County, Tennessee, on January 6, 1882. He was the son of Martha Clementine (Waller) and William Marion Rayburn, a former Confederate cavalryman. The Rayburn family descended from Ulster Scots immigrants who emigrated to the Province of Pennsylvania in 1750. In 1887, the Rayburn family moved to a 40-acre cotton farm near Windom, Texas. Rayburn grew up in poverty as he, his nine siblings, and his parents all participated in running the farm. Toiling in the fields made Rayburn determined to get a good education and help the poor and downtrodden.

Rayburn went to co-educational East Texas Normal College (now East Texas A&amp;M University) in Commerce, Texas, in 1900 with $25 (around $750 in 2020) that his father saved up to help take care of his first few months of college expenses. To help cover tuition and room and board, Rayburn rang the school bell to signal the end of classes and swept out Commerce&#x27;s public school buildings, earning $3 a month. Rayburn obtained his teaching credentials before completing his bachelor of science degree, and earned additional income by teaching in the public school of Greenwood, a small community in Hopkins County. He graduated in 1903 in a class of 13 (9 men and 4 women) and taught school for two years.

==Texas State Legislature==
In 1906, at the age of 24, Rayburn won by a narrow 163 vote margin an election to the 34th district of the Texas House of Representatives. While serving in the legislature, he studied at the University of Texas School of Law, and he was admitted to the bar in 1908. As a representative, Rayburn helped pass laws that made textbooks more widely available to Texas schoolchildren, established the State Board of Health alongside the Texas State Department of Health, and created the Texas Department of Agriculture. Due to his power of persuasion when he was a very young legislator for four years on January 10, 1911, at 29 years of age, Rayburn became the youngest Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives in history. He defeated Clarence E. Gilmore 70 to 63 in the speaker election. Texas speakers from the beginning of statehood until Rayburn&#x27;s tenure were mostly ceremonial and powerless, similar to the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate. Under Texas state law the office actually had immense powers but the previous speakers never exercised them due to deference to party bosses. Upon election as Speaker, Rayburn requested the appointment of a special committee to determine &quot;the duties and rights of the speaker&quot;. This became the first ever codification of the speaker&#x27;s power. He helped pass numerous legislation as Speaker such as shorter working hours for women, child labor laws, and appropriations for a Confederate widows home and a tuberculosis sanitarium. Many decades later Rayburn rated his service as Texas House Speaker as the most enjoyable period in his long political career. He said, &quot;that job had real power—that&#x27;s what a man wants—but power&#x27;s no good unless you have the guts to use it.&quot;

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Due to a series of lucky events for Rayburn, the House district of his home county of Fannin County, the fourth district, was open for him to run. Senator Joseph Weldon Bailey was rocked by allegations of corruption and bribery involving oil companies so he announced his resignation effective January 1913. The longtime incumbent representative of the fourth district, Choice B. Randell, ran for Bailey&#x27;s open senate seat in the July 1912 primary election and lost. Rayburn won election to the House of Representatives in 1912 after a bruising Democratic primary where he won by only 490 votes. He won the general election afterwards and became a Representative. He entered Congress in 1913 at the beginning of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s presidency and served in office for almost 49 years (more than 24 terms), until the beginning of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidency.

Rayburn was a protégé of then-Representative John Nance Garner. Despite Rayburn&#x27;s freshman status, in 1913, Garner helped him become a member of the powerful House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, which handled legislation pertaining to commerce, bridges, coal, oil, communication, motion pictures, securities exchanges, holding companies and the Coast Guard. Rayburn learned how to make deals and how to deal with adversity during his first two decades in the House. While he was a young representative he introduced and helped pass numerous anti-trust and railroad-related legislation such as the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and the Esch–Cummins Transportation Act (The Railway Stock and Bond Bill that was originally introduced in 1914 was the first ever major legislation that was crafted and proposed by Rayburn. In 1920 it finally became law in the Esch-Cummins Act).

As a signal of things to come for Rayburn, after only eight years in the House he was elected to be House Democratic Caucus Chairman. He served as chairman from 1921 to 1923. At only age 39 when he was elected chairman he was the youngest person ever elected to that position. During the 1920s, Rayburn kept a low profile due to the Republican dominance of Congress and the Presidency under Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. Rayburn&#x27;s biggest contribution in this decade was to help create the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the first major victory of his lifelong dream to make paved roads available for all Americans.

Rayburn worked as Garner&#x27;s campaign manager during the 1932 presidential election and released Garner&#x27;s delegates to vote for Roosevelt after a deal was made to make Garner the vice-presidential nominee.

From 1931 to 1937, Rayburn was Chairman of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. Due to his position and influence on this committee he helped pass landmark New Deal bills such as the Truth in Securities Act, the bills that established the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, the Public Utilities Holding Company Act, the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act, and the Rural Electrification Act.

Rayburn was a big supporter of projects that helped make life easier for farmers and rural Americans like dams and farm-to-market roads. His role in creating new lakes such as Lake Texoma and changing old rural dirt roads into fully paved roads ensured lifelong support from his congressional district constituents. The dams in rural America controlled rivers from flooding and also generated electricity. The Flood Control Act of 1936 combined with the Rural Electrification Act helped to bring electricity to 90% of rural America by 1959, compared to only 3% in the early 1930s. In 1943–44, Rayburn helped to establish in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Louisiana the Southwestern Power Administration, which became a &quot;mini-Tennessee Valley Authority&quot; in the region. The main difference from the TVA was the SWPA only involved federal dams constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He also helped pass laws that established the Soil Conservation Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps. These two agencies were primarily engaged in water and soil erosion control due to the negative effects of farming in America that led to catastrophes like the Dust Bowl.

== Speaker of the House ==

On September 16, 1940, at the age of 58, and while serving as House Majority Leader, Rayburn became Speaker of the House upon the sudden death of Speaker William Bankhead. Rayburn&#x27;s ascension to the speakership was surprisingly rapid; that including Bankhead, the three Speakers prior to Rayburn died in office within six years. (Henry Thomas Rainey died in 1934 and Jo Byrns in 1936.)

Rayburn&#x27;s first major crisis after assuming the speakership was World War II. In the decade prior to the war, the United States was isolationist and decided not to participate in the war when war broke out in 1937 in Asia and 1939 in Europe. Rayburn helped pass the Lend-Lease Act in March 1941. This act allowed the U.S. to distribute food, oil, and materiel to the United Kingdom, China, and the Soviet Union. In August 1941, he helped pass the Service Extension Act of 1941. In 1940, a 12-month peacetime draft was instituted by the government to prepare for possible war. The isolationists in the House wanted to not get involved in the war though and wanted to let the peacetime draft expire after 12 months in 1941. After Rayburn talked to all representatives who were anti-draft and tried to persuade them to change their minds, the bill was passed by a vote of 203–202, a one-vote margin. If this bill had been defeated, the U.S. Army stood to lose about two-thirds of its strength and three-fourths of the officer corps due to the end of the draft.
In early 1944, top Roosevelt officials approached Rayburn and asked him to work discreetly with Congress to gain funding for the production of an atomic bomb. Later that year, Rayburn secured $1.6 billion to fund the Manhattan Project, the code name for the secret project that led to the creation of the atomic bomb. This secret operation was done with most of the President&#x27;s own cabinet, all of Congress save for a few members, and even the vice president not knowing about the atomic bomb. Only Rayburn, the Senate Majority Leader, and five other congressmen were aware of this operation. Rayburn had to hide the Manhattan Project through fake names and other deceptive means in appropriation bills until the bombs were used in 1945.

During the 1944 presidential campaign, President Roosevelt offered Speaker Rayburn the vice presidential nomination. Rayburn might have become president had he accepted Roosevelt&#x27;s offer, but he rejected it. As the Speaker, Rayburn had already reached the pinnacle of his ambition. Ultimately, the Democratic vice presidential nomination went to Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman.

In 1946, the Republicans swept the Democrats in the midterm elections, winning both the House and Senate. The Democrats lost 54 seats in the House. Rayburn felt that because he lost in such an overwhelming manner he should step down as House Democratic Leader and not be the Minority Leader in the upcoming congress (this would have likely ended in an early retirement for him before the end of the 1940s). He endorsed the northern Democrat John W. McCormack for Minority Leader, but there was a &quot;draft Rayburn&quot; movement initiated by President Truman, McCormack himself, and all the northern and southern Democrats. Democrats feared that, without Rayburn as their leader, the Democratic Party would have been torn apart by inter-factionalism between northern and southern Democrats and liberal and conservative Democrats. Many people in Washington were then aware of how important Speaker Rayburn was to hold the Democratic Party together. Rayburn accepted the Minority Leader position and remained the House Democratic Leader for the rest of his life. To show how much they appreciated Rayburn&#x27;s decision to stay in office as House Democratic Leader, 142 House Democrats and 50 House Republicans surprised Rayburn with a special gift, a 1947 Cadillac. The House Speaker was provided a government-funded vehicle and the representatives felt bad that now Minority Leader Rayburn would have no car in Washington. Rayburn had a strict personal rule to never accept gifts more than $25 to avoid being bribed. The congressmembers circumvented this rule by combining their single $25 checks together to pay for the car. Rayburn returned all 50 Republican representatives&#x27; checks (to avoid a conflict of interest) but graciously thanked them for their gesture.
In 1947–1948, Rayburn as Minority Leader helped pass the Marshall Plan and the aid package that supported the Truman Doctrine that supported non-communist European countries and helped to stop the spread of communism. He also had to deal with the southern Democrats&#x27; (Dixiecrats&#x27;) reaction to President Truman&#x27;s call for very swift civil rights legislation. The committees were dominated by very powerful southern Democrats who were pro-segregation so these civil rights bills were dead on arrival. Rayburn had to be the moderate between the conservatives and liberals as well as the northern and southern Democrats so he rebuffed Truman&#x27;s civil rights bills that many party members considered very fast but also rejected the southern Democrats&#x27; calls for a pro-segregation candidate to run in place of Truman in the 1948 presidential election. Rayburn was against a swift poll tax repeal and other fast-track civil rights legislation but also ordered the pro-segregation Democrats to run as a third-party due to his fears that the northern Democrats would boycott the election and help the Republicans win the election. Rayburn was a staunch supporter of Truman and was for a gradual civil rights legislation rollout that wouldn&#x27;t be too fast and immediate due to the fears of the backlash by southern Democrats. In 1949, after his successful efforts to win back the House, Senate, and Truman&#x27;s re-election he became Speaker again and supported a repeal of the Texas poll tax. He said that a repeal of the poll tax in Texas would aid the United States in its battle with the Soviet Union for the world&#x27;s hearts and minds.

From 1949 to 1953, Rayburn was Speaker again. He supported Truman&#x27;s Fair Deal but the Conservative Coalition of conservative Republicans and conservative Democrats blocked the Fair Deal legislation from being passed. During his second tenure as Speaker he focused mostly on passing anti-Soviet legislation and getting House support for Truman and the military in the Korean War. By 1952 the Korean War bogged down and Truman&#x27;s popularity crashed. He chose not to run for re-election as a result and the Republicans won the House, Senate, and presidency.
Rayburn&#x27;s second time as Minority Leader coincided with President Eisenhower&#x27;s first two years of his presidency. McCarthyism was in full swing so both parties were trying their best to portray themselves as anti-communist. The Communist Control Act of 1954 and the continuing defense of South Korea and Taiwan and South Vietnam were supported by Rayburn and most Democrats. Rayburn and the Democrats won back the House and Senate in the 1954 elections.

Rayburn&#x27;s third and final tenure as Speaker from 1955 to 1961 was one of the greatest moments of his career. His protégé Senator Lyndon B. Johnson became Majority Leader mostly thanks to Rayburn maneuvering the Senate leadership and making deals to make sure Johnson became Senate Democratic Leader. The trio of Rayburn, Eisenhower, and Johnson worked together well and passed numerous landmark bills such as the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act that established the Interstate Highway System, the National Aeronautics and Space Act that established NASA, the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 that established the FAA, the National Defense Education Act, the Colorado River Storage Project Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which were the first civil rights acts passed since Reconstruction.
In 1958–1959, Rayburn helped admit Alaska and Hawaii into the United States as the 49th and 50th states. Rayburn heavily fought for Alaska after realizing that then-Democratic Alaska would counter then-Republican Hawaii in the Senate and Electoral College. In 1961, Rayburn wanted to pass more civil rights legislation along with President Kennedy but the powerful House Rules Committee was dominated by a conservative coalition of Democrats and Republicans who rejected any socially liberal legislation. Rayburn sought to end the impasse by changing House rules to add three spots (two majority and one minority) to the committee. Rayburn defended his plan in a rare speech on the House floor. &quot;I think this House should be allowed on great measures to work its will and it cannot work its will if the Committee on Rules is so constituted as not to allow the House to pass on those things.&quot; In a 217–212 vote, Rayburn and the Democratic leadership won a narrow but significant victory.
Himself a protégé of Vice President of the United States John Nance Garner, Rayburn was a close friend and mentor of Lyndon B. Johnson and knew Johnson&#x27;s father, Sam, from their days in the Texas Legislature. Rayburn was instrumental to Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s ascent to power, particularly his rapid rise to the position of Minority Leader. Johnson had been in the Senate for a mere four years when he assumed the role. Johnson also owed his subsequent elevation to Majority Leader to Rayburn. Like Johnson, Rayburn did not sign the Southern Manifesto.

As Speaker of the House, Rayburn forged close friendships and partnerships with legislatures of emerging independent countries and democracies on the continent of Africa, especially Nigeria, a rising political power on that continent. Rayburn was a good friend of Jaja Wachuku, the first indigenous Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives, from 1959 to 1960.

=== Personal integrity ===
Although many Texas legislators were on the payroll of public service corporations, Rayburn refused to be. As he recounted in a speech during his congressional campaign:
When I became a member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were representing the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad&#x27;s money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.

This practice of refusing to accept fees from clients with interests before the legislature was &quot;virtually unheard-of&quot; at the time. Later, while serving in Congress, a wealthy oil man had a very expensive horse delivered to Rayburn&#x27;s farm in Bonham. No one apparently knew the oil man delivered the horse except him, Rayburn, and a Rayburn staffer. Rayburn returned the horse.

H.G. Dulaney, an aide to Rayburn and later the director of the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum, said that after speaking in Texas on one occasion Rayburn learned his driver had been given an envelope with money inside from the sponsor of the speech. He said Rayburn made the driver turn around and return the money. Author Robert Caro said, &quot;No one could buy him. Lobbyists could not buy him so much as a meal. Not even the taxpayer could buy him a meal. He refused not only fees but travel expenses for out-of-town speeches; hosts who... attempted to press checks upon him quickly realized they had made a mistake... Rayburn would say, &#x27;I&#x27;m not for sale&#x27; - and then he would walk away without a backward glance.&quot;

=== Legacy ===

In shaping legislation, Rayburn preferred working quietly in the background to being in the public spotlight. As Speaker, he won a reputation for fairness and integrity. In his years in Congress, Rayburn always insisted on paying his own expenses, even going so far as to pay for his own travel expenses when inspecting the Panama Canal when his committee was considering legislation concerning it, rather than exercising his right to have the government pay for it. After he died his estate was valued at just under $300,000, which was mostly land he owned, and the amount of cash he had in various checking accounts was just over $26,000.

Rayburn was well known among his colleagues for his after business hours &quot;Board of Education&quot; meetings in hideaway offices in the House. During these off-the-record sessions, the speaker and powerful committee chairmen would gather for poker, bourbon, and a frank discussion of politics. Rayburn alone determined who received an invitation to these gatherings; to be invited to even one was a high honor. On April 12, 1945, Vice President Harry Truman, a regular attendee since his Senate days, had just arrived at the &quot;Board of Education&quot; when he received a phone call telling him to immediately come to the White House, where he learned that Franklin D. Roosevelt was dead and he was now President of the United States.

Rayburn coined the term &quot;Sun Belt&quot; while strongly supporting the construction of Route 66. It originally ran south from Chicago, through Oklahoma, and then turned westward from Texas to New Mexico and Arizona before ending at the beach in Santa Monica, California. Arguing in favor of the project, he stated famously that America absolutely must connect &quot;the Frost Belt with the Sun Belt&quot;.

Rayburn also had a knack for dressing to suit his occasion. While in Washington, D.C., he would sport expensive suits, starched shirts, and perfectly shined shoes. However, while back in his poorer district in Texas, Rayburn would wear simple shirts, blue jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. Several politicians have imitated this pattern, including Ronald Reagan&#x27;s example of clearing brush when at home in California, while wearing fine suits in Washington.

The phrase &quot;A jackass can kick a barn down, but it takes a carpenter to build one&quot; is attributed to Rayburn.

His home in Texas, now known as the Sam Rayburn House Museum, was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark. In 1957, Rayburn dedicated the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum in Bonham in the style of a presidential library to preserve his memory, library collection, honors, and mementos.

== Personal life and death ==

Rayburn married once, to Metze Jones (1901–1982), sister of Texas Congressman and Rayburn friend Marvin Jones. He had corresponded with her for nine years, and at the time of the wedding Rayburn was 45 and Jones was 26. Their 1927 marriage ended after only a few months; biographers D. B. Hardeman and Donald C. Bacon guessed that Rayburn&#x27;s work schedule and long bachelorhood, combined with the couple&#x27;s differing views on alcohol, contributed to the rift. The court&#x27;s divorce file in Bonham, Texas, has never been located, and Rayburn avoided speaking of his brief marriage. In 2014, the Associated Press reported the existence of a letter Rayburn wrote to Metze after her father died in June 1926.

In 2016, the &quot;Plano Star Courier&quot; published a story about an article in the October 2016 issue of Southwestern Historical Quarterly (a scholarly journal published by the Texas State Historical Association) profiling Sam Rayburn&#x27;s &quot;lady friend&quot; who was a woman named Margaret Fallon (Peggy) Palmer, the widow of former Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, and her close relationship with Rayburn.

In 1956, Rayburn was baptized by Elder H. G. Ball in the Primitive Baptist Church, also known as Old Line Baptist or Hard Shell Baptist Church.

One of his greatest, most painful regrets was that he did not have a son, or as he was quoted as saying in &quot;The Path to Power&quot;, Robert Caro&#x27;s biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, &quot;a towheaded boy to take fishing&quot;.

Rayburn died of pancreatic cancer in 1961 at the age of 79 and was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. His funeral in Bonham, Texas was a large spectacle attended by numerous VIPs, most notably President John F. Kennedy, former presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, and vice president (and future president) Lyndon B. Johnson. Hundreds of members of Congress and numerous other dignitaries attended the funeral. President Kennedy was an honorary pallbearer. By the time of his death, he had served as Speaker for nearly twice as long as any of his predecessors.

Sam Rayburn was close friends with the wood shop instructor Prof. Tarter of East Texas State Teachers College in Commerce, Texas (now East Texas A&amp;M University) and had his own room in the family&#x27;s house during his visits to the district. This house still stands at 1910 Monroe St., Commerce, TX.

Rayburn was a descendant of George Waller, a Revolutionary War militia officer from Henry County, Virginia, and was an honorary president of the Colonel George Waller Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution.

<text>Handy Cross is a hamlet in the parish of Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England. It is located on Marlow Hill, on the old road between Marlow and High Wycombe. At the 2011 Census the population of the hamlet was included in the civil parish of Great Marlow. Today the hamlet consists of a farm, several households and a Harvester pub &amp; restaurant.

The name Handy Cross is also used to refer to the neighbouring Handy Cross roundabout which is an M40 motorway junction (junction 4) linking the M40 to both Marlow and Wycombe. The junction was upgraded during 2006 and early 2007 to improve traffic flows between the M40 and A404.

<doc id="410218" wikidata="Q302545" url="?curid=410218" title="Duke of Manchester">
<text>Duke of Manchester is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain, and the current senior title of the House of Montagu. It was created in 1719 for the politician Charles Montagu, 4th Earl of Manchester. Manchester Parish in Jamaica was named after the 5th Duke, while its capital Mandeville was named after his son and heir. The current Duke is Alexander Montagu, 13th Duke of Manchester, a controversial British and Australian citizen who lives in the United States and has served several prison sentences. He succeeded to the peerage in 2002 following the death of his father Angus Montagu, 12th Duke of Manchester, the last of the dukes to hold a seat in the House of Lords.

== History ==
Their ancestor was Richard Ladde, grandfather of the Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward, who changed his name to Montagu around 1447. His descendants claimed a connection with the older house of Montagu or Montacute, Barons Montagu or Montacute and Earls of Salisbury, but there is no sound evidence that the two families were related. A case has been made out for the possibility that the Ladde alias came from a division among coheirs about 1420 of the remaining small inheritance of a line of Montagus at Spratton and Little Creton, also in Northamptonshire.

The judge Sir Edward Montagu&#x27;s grandson, Edward Montagu, was raised to the peerage as 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton. He is the ancestor of the Dukes of Montagu. His brother, Sir Henry Montagu (c. 1563–1642), who served as Lord Chief Justice as well as Lord High Treasurer and Lord Privy Seal, was in 1620 raised to the Peerage of England as &quot;Viscount Mandeville&quot;, with the additional title &quot;Baron Montagu of Kimbolton&quot;, of Kimbolton in the County of Huntingdon. In 1626, he was made &quot;Earl of Manchester&quot;, of Manchester in the County of Lancaster. It is sometimes said, erroneously, that the title refers to Godmanchester in Huntingdonshire, and that the word &quot;God&quot; was deliberately excluded from the title on the basis that the grantee thought it would be blasphemous for him to be known as &quot;Lord Godmanchester&quot;. However, the form of the creation makes it clear that the title refers to what is now the city of Manchester (at the time a town in Lancashire, formally known as the County of Lancaster).

His son, the 2nd Earl, was a prominent Parliamentary General during the Civil War, but later supported the restoration of Charles II. His son, the 3rd Earl, represented Huntingdonshire in the House of Commons. His son was the 4th Earl, who in 1719 was created &quot;Duke of Manchester&quot;.

Charles, 1st Duke of Manchester, was succeeded by his eldest son. The 2nd Duke notably served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard in the administration of Sir Robert Walpole. He was childless, and on his death, the titles passed to his younger brother, the 3rd Duke. He had earlier represented Huntingdonshire in Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the 4th Duke. He was Ambassador to France and served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household. His son, the 5th Duke, was Governor of Jamaica between 1827 and 1830 also held office as Postmaster General. He was succeeded by his son, the 6th Duke. He represented Huntingdon in the House of Commons as a Tory.

His eldest son, the 7th Duke, was Conservative Member of Parliament for Bewdley and Huntingdonshire. His son, the 8th Duke, briefly represented Huntingdonshire in Parliament. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the 9th Duke. He sat on the Liberal benches in the House of Lords and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard in the Liberal administration of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. In the twentieth century, mismanagement and profligacy resulted in the wholesale depletion of the Dukedom&#x27;s estates. Generational instability caused further damage to the family&#x27;s honour: the 9th, 12th and 13th Dukes all had a criminal record.

Angus Montagu, 12th Duke of Manchester was the last of the dukes to serve in the House of Lords, until the adoption of the House of Lords Act 1999.
Alexander Montagu, the oldest son of the 12th Duke, succeeded his father as the 13th Duke in July 2002; a British and Australian citizen who lives in the United States, he had been known by the courtesy title of the heir apparent, Viscount Mandeville, since his father&#x27;s succession to the peerage in 1985. He has not taken the required action to be included on the Roll of the Peerage, which was created two years after his succession in 2004; while this doesn&#x27;t change his status as a duke itself, which is legally established by the letters patent, inclusion in the roll is since 2004 a requirement to have his title included in his passport. Under the provisions of the 2004 royal warrant he may register with the roll at any time.

== Seats ==
The principal estate of the Dukes of Manchester was Kimbolton Castle. It was leased, together with of parkland, by the 10th Duke in 1951, and is now a private school. A remaining of the estate were sold by his eldest son and heir in 1975. The other family seat was Tandragee Castle, in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. It was sold in 1955, and the remaining estate in 1975, and is now the headquarters of Tayto (NI) Ltd.

== Arms ==

The arms of the Duke of Manchester have the following blazon: &quot;Quarterly, 1st &amp; 4th: Argent, 3 fusils conjoined in fess gules&quot; (Montagu)&quot;; 2nd &amp; 3rd: Or an eagle displayed vert beaked and membered gules&quot; (Monthermer). The &quot;fusils&quot; or diamond shapes in the Montagu arms were originally intended to represent a range of mountains, as the name comes from the old French &quot;mont agu&quot; meaning &quot;pointed hill&quot;. The arms represent a claim to be a cadet of the medieval Montagu (Montacute) family, earls of Salisbury, for which there is no proof (see above origins).

== Titles ==
The Duke of Manchester holds the subsidiary titles &quot;Earl of Manchester&quot;, &quot;Viscount Mandeville&quot;, and &quot;Baron Montagu of Kimbolton&quot;.

The heir apparent to the Dukedom takes the courtesy title &quot;Viscount Mandeville&quot;, and the heir apparent&#x27;s eldest son is styled &quot;Lord Kimbolton&quot;.

==Burial place==
Many members of the Montagu family (Earls and Dukes of Manchester and their family members) are buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Kimbolton, Cambridgeshire (historically in Huntingdonshire). Several Montagu monuments still exist in the South Chapel, while the Montagu Vault (extended in 1853) is located beneath the North Chapel. The Montagu Vault is accessed from the churchyard via a doorway surmounted by heraldic beasts, which was added to the building in 1893. The 12th Duke of Manchester, who died in 2002, was cremated at Bedford Crematorium after which his ashes were placed in the Montagu Vault.

== Viscount Mandeville (1620) ==
== Earls of Manchester (1626) ==
== Dukes of Manchester (1719) ==

The heir presumptive to the dukedom is the present Duke&#x27;s younger brother, Lord Kimble William Drogo Montagu (born 1964), whose heir is his only son William Anthony Drogo Montagu (born 2000).

<text>The  () is a level of administrative division in the French Republic. French are analogous to civil townships and incorporated municipalities in the United States and Canada, &#x27; in Germany,&#x27; in Italy, or &quot;&quot; in Spain. The UK equivalent are civil parishes. are based on historical geographic communities or villages and are vested with significant powers to manage the populations and land of the geographic area covered. The are the fourth-level administrative divisions of France.
 vary widely in size and area, from large sprawling cities with millions of inhabitants like Paris, to small hamlets with only a handful of inhabitants. typically are based on pre-existing villages and facilitate local governance. All have names, but not all named geographic areas or groups of people residing together are ( or ), the difference residing in the lack of administrative powers. Except for the municipal arrondissements of its largest cities, the are the lowest level of administrative division in France and are governed by elected officials including a mayor (&#x27;) and a [[Municipal council (France)|municipal council]] (&#x27;). They have extensive autonomous powers to implement national policy.

== Terminology ==
A &#x27; is the smallest and oldest administrative division in France. &quot;Commune&quot; in English has a historical association with socialist and collectivist political movements and philosophies. This association arises in part from the rising of the Paris Commune (1871) which could have more felicitously been called, in English, &quot;the rising of the City of Paris&quot;. There is nothing intrinsically different between &quot;town&quot; in English and &#x27; in French.

The French word &#x27; appeared in the 12th century, from Medieval Latin &#x27;, for a large gathering of people sharing a common life; from Latin &quot;&quot;, &#x27;things held in common&#x27;.

=== Number of communes ===
As of January 2021, there were 35,083 communes in France, of which 34,836 were in metropolitan France, 129 in the overseas departments, and 83 in the overseas collectivities and New Caledonia. This is a considerably higher total than that of any other European country, because French communes still largely reflect the division of France into villages or parishes at the time of the French Revolution.

The whole territory of the French Republic is divided into communes; even uninhabited mountains or rain forests are dependent on a commune for their administration. This is unlike some other countries, such as the United States, where unincorporated areas directly governed by a county or a higher authority can be found. There are only a few exceptions:
*COM (&quot;collectivité d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;, i.e., overseas collectivity) of Saint-Martin (33,102 inhabitants). It was previously a commune inside the Guadeloupe . The commune structure was abolished when Saint-Martin became an overseas collectivity on 22 February 2007.
*COM of Wallis and Futuna (14,944 inhabitants), which still is divided according to the three traditional chiefdoms.
*COM of Saint Barthélemy (6,852 inhabitants). It was previously a commune inside the Guadeloupe region. The commune structure was abolished when Saint-Barthélemy became an overseas collectivity on 22 February 2007.

Furthermore, two regions without permanent habitation have no communes:
*TOM (&quot;territoire d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;, i.e., overseas territory) of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (no permanent population, about 200 resident scientists, soldiers, and meteorologists)
*Clipperton Island in the Pacific Ocean (uninhabited)

=== Area of a typical commune ===
In metropolitan France, the average area of a commune in 2004 was . The median area of metropolitan France&#x27;s communes at the 1999 census was even smaller, at . The median area gives a better sense of the size of a &quot;typical&quot; mainland France commune than the average area since the average includes some very large communes.

In Italy, the median area of communes (&quot;comuni&quot;) is ; in Belgium it is ; in Spain it is ; and in Germany, the majority of &quot;Länder&quot; have communes (&quot;Gemeinden&quot;) with a median area above . Switzerland and the &quot;Länder&quot; of Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein in Germany were the only places in Europe where the communes had a smaller median area than in France.

The communes of France&#x27;s overseas &quot;départements&quot; such as Réunion and French Guiana are large by French standards. They usually group into the same commune several villages or towns, often with sizeable distances among them. In Réunion, demographic expansion and sprawling urbanization have resulted in the administrative splitting of some &quot;communes&quot;.

=== Population of a typical commune ===
The median population of metropolitan France&#x27;s communes at the 1999 census was 380 inhabitants. Again this is a very small number, and here France stands absolutely apart in Europe, with the lowest communes&#x27; median population of all the European countries (communes in Switzerland or Rhineland-Palatinate may cover a smaller area, as mentioned above, but they are more populated). This small median population of French communes can be compared with Italy, where the median population of communes in 2001 was 2,343 inhabitants, Belgium (11,265 inhabitants), or even Spain (564 inhabitants).

The median population given here should not hide the fact that there are pronounced differences in size between French communes. As mentioned in the introduction, a commune can be a city of 2 million inhabitants such as Paris, a town of 10,000 inhabitants, or just a hamlet of 10 inhabitants. What the median population tells us is that the vast majority of the French communes only have a few hundred inhabitants, but there are also a small number of communes with much higher populations.

In metropolitan France 57 percent of the 36,683 communes have fewer than 500 inhabitants and, with 4,638,000 inhabitants, these smaller communes constitute just 7.7 percent of the total population. In other words, just 8 percent of the French population live in 57 percent of its communes, whilst 92 percent are concentrated in the remaining 43 percent.

=== Example: Alsace ===
Alsace, with an area of , and now part of the Région Grand Est, used to be the smallest of the regions of metropolitan France, and still has no fewer than 904 communes. This high number is typical of metropolitan France but is atypical when compared with other European countries. It shows the distinctive nature of the French commune as a geo-political or administrative entity.

With its 904 communes, Alsace has three times as many municipalities as Sweden, which has a much larger territory covering and yet is divided into only 290 municipalities (&quot;kommuner&quot;). Alsace has more than double the total number of municipalities of the Netherlands which, in spite of having a population nine times larger and a land area four times larger than Alsace, is divided into just 390 municipalities ().

Most of the communes in Alsace, along with those in other regions of France, have rejected the central government&#x27;s calls for mergers and rationalization. By way of contrast, in the German states bordering Alsace, the geo-political and administrative areas have been subject to various re-organizations from the 1960s onward. In the state of Baden-Württemberg, the number of &quot;Gemeinden&quot; or communities was reduced from 3,378 in 1968 to 1,108 in September 2007. In comparison, the number of communes in Alsace was only reduced from 946 in 1971 (just before the Marcellin law aimed at encouraging French communes to merge with each other was passed, see Current debate section below) to 904 in January 2007. Consequently, the Alsace region—despite having a land area only one-fifth the size and a total population only one-sixth of that of its neighbor Baden-Württemberg—has almost as many municipalities. The small Alsace region has more than double the number of municipalities compared to the large and populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia (396 &quot;Gemeinden&quot; in September 2007).

=== Status of the communes ===
Despite differences in population, each of the communes of the French Republic possesses a mayor (&quot;maire&quot;) and a municipal council (&quot;conseil municipal&quot;), which jointly manage the commune from the municipal hall (&quot;mairie&quot;), with exactly the same powers no matter the size of the commune. This uniformity of status is a legacy of the French Revolution, which wanted to do away with the local idiosyncrasies and tremendous differences in status that existed in the kingdom of France.

French law makes allowances for the vast differences in commune size in a number of areas of administrative law. The size of the municipal council, the method of electing the municipal council, the maximum allowable pay of the mayor and deputy mayors, and municipal campaign finance limits (among other features) all depend on the population echelon into which a particular commune falls.

Since the PLM Law of 1982, three French communes also have a special status in that they are further divided into municipal arrondissements: these are Paris, Marseille, and Lyon. The municipal arrondissement is the only administrative unit below the commune in the French Republic but exists only in these three communes. These municipal arrondissements are not to be confused with the arrondissements that are subdivisions of French &quot;départements&quot;: French communes are considered legal entities, whereas municipal arrondissements, by contrast, have no official capacity and no budget of their own.

The rights and obligations of communes are governed by the &quot;Code général des collectivités territoriales (CGCT)&quot; which replaced the &quot;Code des communes&quot; (except for personnel matters) with the passage of the law of 21 February 1996 for legislation and decree number 2000-318 of 7 April 2000 for regulations.

From 1794 to 1977 — except for a few months in 1848 and 1870-1871 — Paris had no mayor and was thus directly controlled by the departmental prefect. This meant that Paris had less autonomy than certain towns or villages. Even after Paris regained the right to elect its own mayor in 1977, the central government retained control of the Paris police. In all other French communes, the municipal police are under the mayor&#x27;s supervision.

== History of the French communes ==
French communes were created at the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789–1790.

=== Kingdom of France ===

==== Parishes ====
Before the revolution, France&#x27;s lowest level of administrative division was the parish (&quot;paroisse&quot;), and there were up to 60,000 of them in the kingdom. A parish was essentially a church, the houses around it (known as the village), and the cultivated land around the village. France was the most populous country in Europe at this time, with a population of approximately 25 million inhabitants in the late 18th century (England in contrast had only 6 million inhabitants), which accounts for the large number of parishes. French kings often prided themselves on ruling over a &quot;realm of 100,000 steeples&quot;.

Parishes lacked the municipal structures of post-Revolution communes. Usually, one contained only a building committee (&quot;conseil de fabrique&quot;), made up of villagers, which managed the buildings of the parish church, the churchyard, and the other numerous church estates and properties, and sometimes also provided help for the poor, or even administered parish hospitals or schools. Since the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts of 1539 by Francis I, the priest in charge of the parish was also required to record baptisms, marriages, and burials. Except for these tasks, villages were left to handle other issues as they pleased. Typically, villagers would gather to decide over a special issue regarding the community, such as agricultural land usage, but there existed no permanent municipal body. In many places, the local feudal lord (&quot;seigneur&quot;) still had a major influence in the village&#x27;s affairs, collecting taxes from tenant-villagers and ordering them to work the corvée, controlling which fields were to be used and when, and how much of the harvest should be given to him.

==== Chartered cities ====
Additionally, some cities had obtained charters during the Middle Ages, either from the king himself or from local counts or dukes (such as the city of Toulouse chartered by the counts of Toulouse). These cities were made up of several parishes (up to 50 parishes in the case of Paris), and they were usually enclosed by a defensive wall. They had been emancipated from the power of feudal lords in the 12th and 13th centuries, had municipal bodies which administered the city, and bore some resemblance with the communes that the French Revolution would establish except for two key points:
* these municipal bodies were not democratic; they were usually in the hands of some rich bourgeois families upon whom, over time, nobility had been conferred, so they can be better labeled as oligarchies rather than municipal democracies.
* there was no uniform status for these chartered cities, each one having its own status and specific organization.

In the north, cities tended to be administered by &quot;échevins&quot; (from an old Germanic word meaning judge), while in the south, cities tended to be administered by &quot;consuls&quot; (in a clear reference to Roman antiquity), but Bordeaux was administered by &quot;jurats&quot; (etymologically meaning &quot;sworn men&quot;) and Toulouse by &quot;capitouls&quot; (&quot;men of the chapter&quot;). Usually, there was no mayor in the modern sense; all the &quot;échevins&quot; or &quot;consuls&quot; were on equal footing, and rendered decisions collegially. However, for certain purposes, there was one &quot;échevin&quot; or &quot;consul&quot; ranking above the others, a sort of mayor, although not with the same authority and executive powers as a modern mayor. This &quot;mayor&quot; was called provost of the merchants (&quot;prévôt des marchands&quot;) in Paris and Lyon; &quot;maire&quot; in Marseille, Bordeaux, Rouen, Orléans, Bayonne and many other cities and towns; &quot;mayeur&quot; in Lille; &quot;premier capitoul&quot; in Toulouse; &quot;viguier&quot; in Montpellier; &quot;premier consul&quot; in many towns of southern France; &quot;prêteur royal&quot; in Strasbourg; &quot;maître échevin&quot; in Metz; &quot;maire royal&quot; in Nancy; or &quot;prévôt&quot; in Valenciennes.

=== French Revolution ===
On 14 July 1789, at the end of the afternoon, following the storming of the Bastille, the provost of the merchants of Paris, Jacques de Flesselles was shot by the crowd on the steps of Paris City Hall. Although in the Middle Ages the provosts of the merchants symbolized the independence of Paris and even had openly rebelled against King Charles V, their office had been suppressed by the king, then reinstated but with strict control from the king, and so they had ended up being viewed by the people as yet another representative of the king, no longer the embodiment of a free municipality.

Following that event, a &quot;commune&quot; of Paris was immediately set up to replace the old medieval chartered city of Paris, and a municipal guard was established to protect Paris against any attempt made by King Louis XVI to quell the ongoing revolution. Several other cities of France quickly followed suit, and communes arose everywhere, each with their municipal guard. On 14 December 1789, the National Assembly (&quot;Assemblée Nationale&quot;) passed a law creating the commune, designed to be the lowest level of administrative division in France, thus endorsing these independently created communes, but also creating communes of its own. In this area as in many others, the work of the National Assembly was, properly speaking, revolutionary: not content with transforming all the chartered cities and towns into communes, the National Assembly also decided to turn all the village parishes into full-status communes. The Revolutionaries were inspired by Cartesian ideas as well as by the philosophy of the Enlightenment. They wanted to do away with all the peculiarities of the past and establish a perfect society, in which all and everything should be equal and set up according to reason, rather than by tradition or conservatism.

Thus, they set out to establish administrative divisions that would be uniform across the country: the whole of France would be divided into &quot;départements&quot;, themselves divided into arrondissements, themselves divided into cantons, themselves divided into communes, no exceptions. All of these communes would have equal status, they would all have a mayor at their head and a municipal council elected by the inhabitants of the commune. This was a real revolution for the thousands of villages that never had experienced organized municipal life before. A communal house had to be built in each of these villages, which would house the meetings of the municipal council as well as the administration of the commune. Some in the National Assembly were opposed to such a fragmentation of France into thousands of communes, but eventually Mirabeau and his ideas of one commune for each parish prevailed.

On 20 September 1792, the recording of births, marriages, and deaths also was withdrawn as a responsibility of the priests of the parishes and handed to the mayors. Civil marriages were established and started to be performed in the &quot;mairie&quot; with a ceremony not unlike the traditional one, with the mayor replacing the priest, and the name of the law replacing the name of God (&quot;Au nom de la loi, je vous déclare unis par les liens du mariage.&quot; – &quot;In the name of the law, I declare you united by the bonds of marriage.&quot;). Priests were forced to surrender their centuries-old baptism, marriage, and burial books, which were deposited in the &quot;mairies&quot;. These abrupt changes profoundly alienated devout Catholics, and France soon was plunged into the throes of civil war, with the fervently religious regions of western France at its center. It would take Napoleon I to re-establish peace in France, stabilize the new administrative system, and make it generally accepted by the population. Napoleon also abolished the election of the municipal councils, which now were chosen by the prefect, the local representative of the central government.

=== Trends after the French Revolution ===
Today, French communes are still very much the same in their general principles as those that were established at the beginning of the Revolution. The biggest changes occurred in 1831, when the French Parliament re-established the principle of the election of municipal councils, and in 1837 when French communes were given legal &quot;personality&quot;, being now considered legal entities with legal capacity. The Jacobin revolutionaries were afraid of independent local powers, which they saw as conservative and opposed to the revolution, and so they favored a powerful central state. Therefore, when they created the communes, they deprived them of any legal &quot;personality&quot; (as they did with the &quot;départements&quot;), with only the central state having legal &quot;personality.&quot; By 1837 that situation was judged impractical, as mayors and municipal councils could not be parties in courts. The consequence of the change, however, was that tens of thousands of villages which had never had legal &quot;personality&quot; (contrary to the chartered cities) suddenly became legal entities for the first time in their history. This is still the case today.

During the revolution, approximately 41,000 communes were created, on territory corresponding to the limits of modern-day France (the 41,000 figure includes the communes of the departments of Savoie, Haute-Savoie and Alpes-Maritimes which were annexed in 1795, but does not include the departments of modern-day Belgium and Germany west of the Rhine, which were part of France between 1795 and 1815). This was fewer than the 60,000 parishes that existed before the revolution (in cities and towns, parishes were merged into one single commune; in the countryside, some very small parishes were merged with bigger ones), but 41,000 was still a considerable number, without any comparison in the world at the time, except in the empire of China (but there, only county level and above had any permanent administration).

Since then, tremendous changes have affected France, as they have the rest of Europe: the Industrial Revolution, two world wars, and the rural exodus have all depopulated the countryside and increased the size of cities. French administrative divisions, however, have remained extremely rigid and unchanged. Today about 90 percent of communes and departments are exactly the same as those designed at the time of the French Revolution more than 200 years ago, with the same limits. Countless rural communes that had hundreds of inhabitants at the time of the French Revolution now have only a hundred inhabitants or fewer. On the other hand, cities and towns have grown so much that their urbanized area is now extending far beyond the limits of their commune which were set at the time of the revolution. The most extreme example of this is Paris, where the urbanized area sprawls over 396 communes.

Paris in fact was one of the very few communes of France whose limits were extended to take into account the expansion of the urbanized area. The new, larger, commune of Paris was set up under the oversight of Emperor Napoléon III in 1859, but after 1859 the limits of Paris rigidified. Unlike most other European countries, which stringently merged their communes to better reflect modern-day densities of population (such as Germany and Italy around 1970), dramatically decreasing the number of communes in the processthe &quot;Gemeinden&quot; of West Germany were decreased from 24,400 to 8,400 in the space of a few yearsFrance only carried out mergers at the margin, and those were mostly carried out during the 19th century. From 41,000 communes at the time of the French Revolution, the number decreased to 37,963 in 1921, to 36,569 in 2008 (in metropolitan France).

Thus, in Europe, only Switzerland has as high a density of communes as France, and even there an extensive merger movement has started in the last 10 years. To better grasp the staggering number of communes in France, two comparisons can be made: First, of the original 15 member states of the European Union there are approximately 75,000 communes; France alone, which comprises 16 percent of the population of the EU-15, had nearly half of its communes. Second, the United States, with a territory fourteen times larger than that of the French Republic, and nearly five times its population, had 35,937 incorporated municipalities and townships at the 2002 Census of Governments, fewer than that of the French Republic. The number of barangays in the Philippines, villages of Indonesia, and muban in Thailand also have a higher number than the French communes.

=== Communes nouvelles ===

There have long been calls in France for a massive merger of communes, including by such distinguished voices as the president of the Cour des Comptes (the central auditing administrative body in France). In 1971 the Marcellin law offered support and money from the government to entice the communes to merge freely with each other, but the law had only a limited effect (only about 1,300 communes agreed to merge with others). Many rural communes with few residents struggle to maintain and manage basic services such as running water, garbage collection, or properly paved communal roads.

Mergers, however, are not easy to achieve. One problem is that mergers reduce the number of available elected positions, and thus are not popular with local politicians. Moreover, citizens from one village may be unwilling to have their local services run by an executive located in another village, whom they may consider unaware of or inattentive to their local needs.

In December 2010 the law n° 2010-1563 regarding reform of territorial collectivities was adopted, which created the legal framework for the &quot;communes nouvelles&quot; (lit. &quot;new communes&quot;). A &quot;commune nouvelle&quot; can be created by merger of a number of communes at the request of the municipal councils of all the communes or at the initiative of the state representative in the department (the prefect). The municipal council of the new commune can decide to create &quot;communes déléguées&quot; (lit. &quot;delegated communes&quot;) in the place of the former communes, which are represented by a delegated mayor and a delegated council. Between 2012 and 2021, about 820 &quot;communes nouvelles&quot; have been established, replacing about 2,550 old communes.

=== Intercommunality ===

The expression &quot;intercommunality&quot; (&quot;intercommunalité&quot;) denotes several forms of cooperation between communes. Such cooperation first made its appearance at the end of the 19th century in the form of a law on 22 March 1890, which provided for the establishment of single-purpose intercommunal associations. French lawmakers having long been aware of the inadequacy of the communal structure inherited from the French Revolution for dealing with a number of practical matters, the so-called Chevènement law of 12 July 1999 is the most recent and most thoroughgoing measure aimed at strengthening and simplifying this principle.

In recent years it has become increasingly common for communes to band together in intercommunal consortia for the provision of such services as refuse collection and water supply. Suburban communes often team up with the city at the core of their urban area to form a community charged with managing public transport or even administering the collection of local taxes.

The Chevènement law tidied up all these practices, abolishing some structures and creating new ones. In addition, it offered central government finance aimed at encouraging further communes to join in intercommunal structures. Unlike the only partially successful statute enacted in 1966 and enabling urban communes to form urban communities or the more marked failure of the Marcellin law of 1971, the Chevènement law met with a large measure of success, so that a majority of French communes are now involved in intercommunal structures.

There are two types of these structures:
* Those without fiscal power, the loosest form of intercommunality. Mainly in this category are the traditional syndicates of communes. Communes gather and contribute financially to the syndicate, but the syndicate cannot levy its own taxes. Communes can leave the syndicate at any time. Syndicates can be set up for a particular purpose or to deal with several simultaneous matters. These structures have been left untouched by the Chevènement law, and they are on the decline.
* Structures with fiscal power. This is what the Chevènement law was concerned with, and it distinguished three structures with fiscal power:
** the community of communes (), aimed primarily at rural communes;
** the community of agglomeration (), aimed at towns and middle-sized cities and their suburbs;
** the urban community (&quot;communauté urbaine&quot;), aimed at larger cities and their suburbs.
** the metropolis (&quot;métropole&quot;), established in 2014, aimed at the largest cities and their suburbs.

:These three structures are given varying levels of fiscal power, with the community of agglomeration and the urban community having the most fiscal power, levying the local tax on corporations (&quot;taxe professionnelle&quot;) in their own name instead of those of the communes, and with the same level of taxation across the communes of the community. The communities must also manage some services previously performed by the communes, such as garbage collection or transport, but the law also makes it mandatory for the communities to manage other areas such as economic planning and development, housing projects, or environment protection. Communities of communes are required to manage the fewest areas, leaving the communes more autonomous, while urban communities are required to manage most matters, leaving the communes within them with less autonomy.

==== Allocation of government money ====
In exchange for the creation of a community, the government allocates money to them based on their population, thus providing an incentive for communes to team up and form communities. Communities of communes are given the least money per inhabitant, whereas urban communities are given the most money per inhabitant, thus pushing communes to form more integrated communities where they have fewer powers, which they might otherwise have been loath to do if it were not for government money.

The Chevènement law has been extremely successful in the sense that a majority of French communes now have joined the new intercommunal structures. On 1 January 2007, there were 2,573 such communities in metropolitan France (including five syndicats d&#x27;agglomération nouvelle, a category currently being phased out), made up of 33,327 communes (91.1 percent of all the communes of metropolitan France), and 52.86 million inhabitants, i.e., 86.7 percent of the population of metropolitan France.

These impressive results however may hide a murkier reality. In rural areas, many communes have entered a community of communes only to benefit from government funds. Often the local syndicate has been turned officially into a community of communes, the new community of communes in fact managing only the services previously managed by the syndicate, contrary to the spirit of the law which has established the new intercommunal structures to carry out a much broader range of activities than that undertaken by the old syndicates. Some say that, should government money transfers be stopped, many of these communities of communes would revert to their former status of syndicate, or simply completely disappear in places where there were no syndicates prior to the law.

In urban areas, the new intercommunal structures are much more a reality, being created by local decision-makers out of genuine belief in the worth of working together. However, in many places, local feuds have arisen, and it was not possible to set up an intercommunal structure for the whole of the urban area: some communes refusing to take part in it, or even creating their own structure. In some urban areas like Marseille there exist four distinct intercommunal structures! In many areas, rich communes have joined with other rich communes and have refused to let in poorer communes, for fear that their citizens would be overtaxed to the benefit of poorer suburbs.

Moreover, intercommunal structures in many urban areas are still new, and fragile: Tensions exist between communes; the city at the center of the urban area often is suspected of wishing to dominate the suburban communes; communes from opposing political sides also may be suspicious of each other.

Two famous examples of this are Toulouse and Paris. In Toulouse, on top of there being six intercommunal structures, the main community of Toulouse and its suburbs is only a community of agglomeration, although Toulouse is large enough to create an Urban Community according to the law. This is because the suburban communes refused an urban community for fear of losing too much power, and opted for a community of agglomeration, despite the fact that a community of agglomeration receives less government funds than an urban community. As for Paris, no intercommunal structure has emerged there, the suburbs of Paris fearing the concept of a &quot;Greater Paris&quot;, and so disunity still is the rule in the metropolitan area, with the suburbs of Paris creating many different intercommunal structures all without the city.

One major often raised problem with intercommunality, is the fact that the intercommunal structures are not subject to direct election by the people, so it is the representatives of each individual commune that sit in the new structure. As a consequence, civil servants and bureaucrats are the ones setting up the agenda and implementing it, with the elected representatives of the communes only endorsing key decisions.

== Classification ==
INSEE &quot;(Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques)&quot; gives numerical indexing codes to various entities in France, notably the communes (which do not coincide with postcodes). The complete code has eight digits and three spaces within, but there is a popular simplified code with five digits and no space within:
*Two digits (department) and three digits (commune) for the 96 departments of metropolitan France.
*Three digits (department or collectivity) and two digits (commune) for the Overseas departments, Overseas collectivities and Overseas countries.

== Administration ==
Each commune has a municipal council (&quot;conseil municipal&quot;) composed of municipal councilors (&quot;conseillers municipaux&quot;).
The municipal council is the legislative and deliberative organ of the commune.
The municipal councilors are elected by the inhabitants of the commune for a 6-year term.
Each commune is governed by a mayor (&quot;maire&quot;) elected for a 6-year term.

== Miscellaneous facts ==

=== Most and least populous communes ===
*Paris is the most populous commune of France with 2,187,526 residents as of 2017.
*Six of the French villages destroyed in the First World War have never been rebuilt. All are found in the &quot;département&quot; of Meuse and were destroyed during the Battle of Verdun in 1916. After the war, it was decided that the land previously occupied by the destroyed villages would not be incorporated into other communes, as a testament to these villages which had &quot;died for France&quot;, as they were declared, and to preserve their memory. The following communes are entirely unpopulated and are managed by a council of three members, appointed by the prefect of Meuse:
**Beaumont-en-Verdunois
**Bezonvaux
**Cumières-le-Mort-Homme
**Fleury-devant-Douaumont
**Haumont-près-Samogneux
**Louvemont-Côte-du-Poivre
*Apart from the above cases, the communes with the fewest inhabitants in the French Republic are:
**commune of Rochefourchat (Drôme), in southeastern France, one inhabitant as of 2021.
**commune of Leménil-Mitry (Meurthe-et-Moselle), in eastern France, two inhabitants as of 2021.
**commune of La Bâtie-des-Fonds (Drôme), three inhabitants as of 2021.

=== Communes with non-French names ===
In areas where languages other than French are or were spoken, most place-names have been translated into a French spelling and pronunciation, such as Dunkerque (&quot;Duinkerke&quot; in Dutch), Toulouse (&quot;Tolosa&quot; in Occitan), Strasbourg (&quot;Straßburg&quot; in German), Perpignan (&quot;Perpinyà&quot; in Catalan), and many place names derived from Gaulish or Latin. However, many smaller communes have retained their native name. Other examples of retained names in the languages once spoken, or still spoken, on French territory:

<text>Marlow ( ), historically Great Marlow or Chipping Marlow, is a town and civil parish within the Unitary Authority of Buckinghamshire, England. It is located on the River Thames, south-southwest of High Wycombe, west-northwest of Maidenhead and west of central London.

==Name==
The name is recorded in 1015 as &quot;Mere lafan&quot;, meaning &quot;Land left after the draining of a pond&quot; in Old English.

From Norman times the manor, parish, and later borough were formally known as Great Marlow, distinguishing them from Little Marlow. The ancient parish was large, including rural areas north and west of the town. In 1896 the civil parish of Great Marlow was divided into Great Marlow Urban District (the town) and Great Marlow civil parish (the rural areas). In 1897 the urban district was renamed Marlow Urban District, and the town has been known simply as Marlow.

==History==
Marlow is recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Merlaue&quot;.

Magna Britannia includes the following entry for Marlow: &quot;The manor of Marlow, which had belonged to the Earls of Mercia, was given by William the Conqueror, to his Queen Matilda. Henry the First, bestowed it on his natural son, Robert de Melhent, afterwards Earl of Gloucester, from whom it passed, with that title, to the Clares and Despencers, and from the latter, by female heirs, to the Beauchamps and Nevilles, Earls of Warwick. It continued in the crown from the time of Richard III&#x27;s marriage with Anne Neville, until Queen Mary granted it to William Lord Paget, in whose family it continued more than a century; after which, it passed, by purchase, to Sir Humphrey Winch, in 1670; to Lord Falkland in 1686; to Sir James Etheridge in 1690; to Sir John Guise in 1718; and to Sir William Clayton in 1736. It is now the property of Sir William Clayton bart. a descendant of the last purchaser&quot;.

Marlow owed its importance to its location on the River Thames, where the road from Reading to High Wycombe crosses the river. It had its own market by 1227 (hence the name Chipping Marlow), although the market lapsed before 1600. Marlow&#x27;s status as a regional commercial centre was present even before the first bridge in this area was built in the 13th century due to the settlement acting as an inland port.

A 14th century hall, known as &#x27;&quot;The Old Parsonage&quot;&#x27; built in Marlow on St Peters Street is currently the oldest inhabited building in Buckinghamshire.

From 1301 to 1307, the town had its own Member of Parliament, and it returned two members from 1624 to 1867.

The population of Great Marlow was 4,480 by 1841.

==Geography==
Marlow is adjoined by Marlow Bottom, a mile to the north. Little Marlow is nearby to the east along the A4155 Little Marlow Road and Bourne End is further along the same road. To the south across the Thames are Bisham (home of Bisham Abbey) and Cookham Dean, both in Berkshire.

==Landmarks==
There has been a Marlow Bridge over the Thames since the reign of King Edward III. The current bridge is a suspension bridge, designed by William Tierney Clark in 1832, and it was constructed by 1835. It was a prototype for and is twinned with the much larger Széchenyi Chain Bridge across the River Danube in Budapest.
Next to the bridge along the river is All Saints Church, in the centre of the town, at the bottom of the High Street. A church has been part of Marlow since the 11th century. The present building was constructed in the Victorian Era, as the spire of the previous Norman church collapsed in 1831. The new church is built of Bath stone, with a spire reaching . The church was completed in 1835, and was designed by Charles Frederick Inwood. Some stone monuments and statues were saved from the Norman style church.
The Junior Wing of the Royal Military College, which is now based at Sandhurst, was once based at Remnantz, a large house in West Street, built in the early 18th century.
Marlow Town Hall, which later became a hotel and then a shop, was completed in 1807.
The Hand &amp; Flowers, the first gastropub to hold two Michelin stars, is located on West Street. It is one of several local pubs serving award-winning beers brewed locally, in Marlow Bottom, by the Rebellion Beer Company.

Marlow is the location of Marlow Lock, originating from the 14th century.
==Twinning==

Marlow is twinned with
* Marly-le-Roi, France, since 1980.
* Budavár, a district of Budapest, Hungary.

==Transport==
The A4155 road runs through Marlow town centre, with the A404 lying one mile to the east, the M40 motorway further to the north, and the M4 motorway to the south.

Marlow is served by a railway station which is the terminus of a single-track branch line from Maidenhead. The train service is known as the Marlow Donkey, which was the nickname given to the steam locomotives that once operated on the line. There is also a pub with the same name, located close to the railway station.

Bus services are provided by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex to neighbouring towns, including High Wycombe, Henley-on-Thames and Reading.

==Education==
Education is provided by several schools, including:
*Great Marlow School (11–18)
*Sir William Borlase&#x27;s Grammar School (11–18)
*Burford School (4–11)
*Danesfield School (4–11)
*Foxes Piece School (4–11)
*Holy Trinity Church of England School (7–11)
*Marlow Church of England Infant School (4–7)
*Spinfield School (4–11)
*St Peter&#x27;s Catholic Primary School (4–11)

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Marlow, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Marlow Town Council, and Buckinghamshire Council.
Marlow Town Council was established in 1974 as a successor parish to the former Marlow Urban District Council, which had been created in 1896. The urban district council had been based at Court Garden House since 1934, and the town council continues to be based there. Between 1974 and 2020 the town was also included in the Wycombe District, based in High Wycombe. The county and district councils merged in 2020 to become the unitary Buckinghamshire Council.

Marlow is divided into three wards for electing town councillors: North &amp; West, South and South East. There are a total of twelve Marlow Town Councillors elected from these wards. The wards have seven, two and three seats respectively. Since 2011, the Town Council has been entirely Conservative with several councillors &quot;double-hatting&quot; across town and county council. The town forms a single ward with three councillors for electing councillors to Buckinghamshire Council.

In the 2021 local elections, a group of independent candidates contested eleven out of the twelve seats. They worked under the banner &quot;Independents for Marlow&quot; and were inspired by similar actions in Frome, High Wycombe, and other places, part of the &quot;flatpack democracy&quot; movement. None were successful and all twelve seats were held by Conservatives.

==Notable people==
Notable current and former residents in approximate birth order.

* Sir William Borlase, a British politician born in the 17th century. In 1624 he founded Sir William Borlase Grammar School in the town of Marlow in memory of his son Henry Borlase MP for Greater Marlow.
*Dr William Battie, an eminent 18th-century physician specialising in mental illness, built and lived in Court Garden House from 1758 until his death in 1776. Local lore has it that he forgot to include a staircase to the first floor, so it had to be added later. In 1789 his daughter sold the house to Richard Davenport, High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, who lived there for 10 years, during which, Court Garden was described in Boydells &quot;History of the River Thames&quot; (1793), as &quot;a fine Georgian house standing on a gentle eminence, a lawn of some extent descending gradually from it to the river.&quot; In 1926 the estate was saved for the people of Marlow, largely due to the efforts of local resident and Crimean War veteran General George Higginson, after whom Higginson Park is named.
*Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley moved into a house in West Street in 1816. He composed &quot;The Revolt of Islam&quot; there in 1817, while Mary worked on &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Thomas Love Peacock, who had suggested Shelley move to the town, wrote his novel &quot;Nightmare Abbey&quot; (1818) at a nearby house.

<doc id="410227" wikidata="Q2634308" url="?curid=410227" title="Shurikenjutsu">
<text>is a general term describing the traditional Japanese martial arts of throwing &quot;shuriken&quot;, which are small, hand-held weapons used primarily by the Samurai in feudal Japan, such as metal spikes &quot;bō shuriken&quot;, circular plates of metal known as &quot;hira shuriken&quot;, and knives (&quot;tantō&quot;).

Shurikenjutsu was usually taught among the &quot;sogo-bugei&quot;, or comprehensive martial arts systems of Japan, as a supplemental art to those more commonly practiced such as &quot;kenjutsu&quot;, &quot;sojutsu&quot;, &quot;bōjutsu&quot; and battlefield grappling &quot;kumi-uchi&quot; (old form &quot;jujutsu&quot;), and is much less prevalent today than it was in the feudal era.

==History==
There is a lack of reliable documentation regarding the art&#x27;s history when compared to other arts, however there are various oral traditions peculiar to each school (&quot;ryū&quot;), that describe how their art developed and came to be used within their system.

The art possesses many originators and innovators who discovered and developed their own various methods of adapting everyday objects into throwing weapons, hence the wide variety of both schools and blades. Furthermore, the art itself is typically quite secretive, as shurikenjutsu gains its tactical advantage by using stealth and surprise. Shuriken are small and easily concealed, yet they have the versatility of being used as a stabbing weapon at close range (called &quot;shoken&quot; if used in this manner), as well as a longer range thrown weapon.

==Types of shuriken==
Shuriken consist of two basic designs:
*&quot;Bo-shuriken&quot; - straight metal spikes, usually 4-sided but sometimes round or octagonal. They were normally single-pointed but variations exist that are double pointed. The average length was and the average weight was around . The bo shuriken is thrown by holding it in the palm with the shaft resting between the first and second fingers. They are thrown from either hand, overhand, underhand, or sidearm from standing, seated, and lying positions. This is the most common form of shuriken used in traditional shurikenjutsu.
*&quot;Hira-shuriken&quot;, &quot;shaken&quot; (or &quot;throwing stars&quot;) - flat, wheel-shaped plates of metal, with sharpened points. Usually thick or less, about wide, with a variety of tips ranging between 3-20. The hira-shuriken can be thrown either from overhead, or horizontally with a quick wrist-snap, depending on the weapon.

==Modern practice==
The decree to outlaw shurikenjutsu during Japan&#x27;s Tokugawa period drove the practice underground, and further shrouded it in secrecy. As the Edo-era drew to a close, the abolition of the Samurai caste system and the subsequent modernization of Japan&#x27;s military, led to the near extinction of shurikenjutsu. In fact, of the 50 or so styles which once existed, only a few remain fully intact today; passed down over the generations via an unbroken lineage. The only specialist school to have survived is the Negishi-ryū, which was founded by Negishi Shorei in the mid-19th century. 

Modern-day shurikenjutsu authorities, Naruse Kanji 成瀬関次(1888 - 1948) and Fujita Seiko 藤田西湖(1899 - 1966) also transmitted valuable information to future generations in the form of articles, books, photos and illustrations. Today, the largest organization focusing on the use of shuriken is the Meifu Shinkage-ryū, a modern-day school, founded by Someya Chikatoshi in the late 1970s.

==Popular culture==
* Shurikenjutsu is featured in many martial arts franchises, and is Best Depicted in the Japanese Manga and Anime media including &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;Sword of The Stranger&quot;.
Western Media has also tried to incorporate use of Shurinkenjutsu in some of their Martial art media drawing Heavy Influence from Japanese culture such as &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Ninja Storm&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Samurai&quot;, &quot;Digimon&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Ninja Steel&quot;, etc.
* Shurikenjutsu is used by Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
* Shurikenjutsu is used by Espio the Chameleon in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.
* The DC Comics superhero Batman uses shurikenjutsu when throwing batarangs. This was also done by Batgirl as well as many Robins such as Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, and Damian Wayne.

<text>Elisabeth of Wied (Pauline Elisabeth Ottilie Luise; 29 December 18432 March 1916) was the first Queen of Romania as the wife of King Carol I from 15 March 1881 to 27 September 1914. She had been the princess consort of Romania since her marriage to then-Prince Carol on 15 November 1869.

Elisabeth was born into a German noble family. She was briefly considered as a potential bride for the future British king Edward VII, but Edward rejected her. Elisabeth married Prince Carol of Romania in 1869. Their only child, Princess Maria, died aged three in 1874, and Elisabeth never fully recovered from the loss of her daughter. When Romania became a kingdom in 1881, Elisabeth became queen, and she was crowned together with Carol that same year. 

Elisabeth was a prolific writer under the name Carmen Sylva.

==Family and early life==
Born at Castle Monrepos in Neuwied, she was the daughter of Hermann, Prince of Wied, and his wife Princess Marie of Nassau.

Elisabeth had artistic leanings; her childhood featured seances and visits to the local asylum for the mentally ill.

==Marriage==

When she was about 16, Elisabeth was considered as a possible bride for Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (&quot;Bertie&quot;), the eldest son and heir apparent of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The Queen strongly favored Elisabeth as a prospective daughter-in-law and urged her daughter Victoria, Princess Royal, to look further into her. Elisabeth was spending the social season at the Berlin court, where her family hoped she would be tamed into a docile, marriageable princess. Princess Victoria told the Queen, &quot;I do not think her at all distinguée looking—certainly the opposite to Bertie&#x27;s usual taste&quot;, whereas the tall and slender Alexandra of Denmark was &quot;just the style Bertie admires&quot;. The Prince of Wales was also shown photographs of Elisabeth, but professed himself unmoved and declined to give them a second glance. In the end, Alexandra was selected for Albert Edward.

Elisabeth first met Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in Berlin in 1861. In 1869, Karl, who was now Prince Carol of Romania, traveled to Germany in search of a suitable consort. He was reunited with Elisabeth, and the two were married on 15 November 1869 in Neuwied. Their only child, a daughter, Maria, died in 1874 at age three — an event from which Elisabeth never recovered. She was crowned Queen of Romania in 1881 after Romania was proclaimed a kingdom.

In the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, also known as the Romanian War of Independence, she devoted herself to the care of the wounded, and founded the Decoration of the Cross of Queen Elisabeth to reward distinguished service in such work. She fostered the higher education of women in Romania, and established societies for various charitable objects. She was the 835th Dame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa. She died at the Golescu Mansion in Bucharest. 

She founded the National Society for the Blind and was the first royal patron of the Romanian Red Cross.

Early distinguished by her excellence as a pianist, organist and singer, she also showed considerable ability in painting and illuminating; but a lively poetic imagination led her to the path of literature, and more especially to poetry, folk-lore and ballads. In addition to numerous original works she put into literary form many of the legends current among the Romanian peasantry.

==Literary activity==

As &quot;Carmen Sylva&quot;, she wrote with facility in German, Romanian, French and English. A few of her voluminous writings, which include poems, plays, novels, short stories, essays, collections of aphorisms, etc., may be singled out for special mention:
*Her earliest publications were &quot;Sappho&quot; and &quot;Hammerstein&quot;, two poems which appeared at Leipzig in 1880.
*In 1888 she received the &quot;&quot;, a prize awarded triennially by the Académie française, for her volume of prose aphorisms &quot;Les Pensees d&#x27;une reine&quot; (Paris, 1882), a German version of which is entitled &quot;Vom Amboss&quot; (Bonn, 1890).
*&quot;Cuvinte Sufletesci&quot;, religious meditations in Romanian (Bucharest, 1888), was also translated into German (Bonn, 1890), as &quot;Seelen-Gespräche&quot;.

Several of the queen’s works as &quot;Carmen Sylva&quot; were written in collaboration with Mite Kremnitz, one of her maids of honor; these were published between 1881 and 1888, sometimes under the joint pseudonym Dito et Idem. These include:
* &quot;Aus zwei Welten&quot; (Leipzig, 1884), a novel
* &quot;Anna Boleyn&quot; (Bonn, 1886), a tragedy
* &quot;In der Irre&quot; (Bonn, 1888), a collection of short stories
* &quot;Edleen Vaughan&quot;, or &quot;Paths of Peril&quot; (London, 1894), a novel
* &quot;Sweet Hours&quot; (London, 1904), a collection of English poems

Among several translations by &quot;Carmen Sylva&quot; include:
* German versions of Pierre Loti&#x27;s romance &quot;Pecheur d&#x27;Islande&quot;
* German versions of Paul de St Victor&#x27;s dramatic criticisms &quot;Les Deux Masques&quot; (Paris, 1881–1884)
* &quot;The Bard of the Dimbovitza&quot;, an English translation of Elena Văcărescu&#x27;s collection of Romanian folk-songs, etc., entitled &quot;Lieder aus dem Dimbovitzathal&quot; (Bonn, 1889), translated in collaboration with British poet Alma Strettell. &quot;The Bard of the Dimbovitza&quot; was first published in 1891, and was soon reissued and expanded.

Translations of original works by &quot;Carmen Sylva&quot; have appeared in all principal languages of Europe and in Armenian.

A book of reminiscences, &quot;From Memory&#x27;s Shrine&quot;, was published in 1911.

==Văcărescu Affair==
In 1881, due to the lack of heirs to the Romanian throne, King Carol I adopted his nephew, Ferdinand. Ferdinand, a complete stranger in his new home, started to get close to one of Elisabeth&#x27;s ladies in waiting, Elena Văcărescu. Elisabeth, very close to Elena herself, encouraged the romance, although she was perfectly aware of the fact that a marriage between the two was forbidden by the Romanian constitution.

The result of this was the exile of both Elisabeth (in Neuwied) and Elena (in Paris), as well as a trip by Ferdinand through Europe in search of a suitable bride, whom he eventually found in Queen Victoria&#x27;s granddaughter, Princess Marie of Edinburgh. The affair helped reinforce Elisabeth&#x27;s image as a dreamer and eccentric.

Quite unusually for a queen, Elisabeth of Wied was personally of the opinion that a republican form of government was preferable to monarchy—an opinion which she expressed forthrightly in her diary, though she did not make it public at the time:&quot;&quot;I must sympathize with the Social Democrats, especially in view of the inaction and corruption of the nobles. These &quot;little people&quot;, after all, want only what nature confers: equality. The Republican form of government is the only rational one. I can never understand the foolish people, the fact that they continue to tolerate us.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="410231" wikidata="Q192498" url="?curid=410231" title="Administrative divisions of France">
<text>The administrative divisions of France are concerned with the institutional and territorial organization of French territory. These territories are located in many parts of the world. There are many administrative divisions, which may have political (local government), electoral (districts), or administrative (decentralized services of the state) objectives. All the inhabited territories are represented in the National Assembly, Senate and Economic and Social Council and their citizens have French citizenship and elect the President of France.

== Types of division ==
=== Regions, the most integrated territories ===
The French Republic is divided into 18 regions: 12 in mainland France and 6 elsewhere (1 in Europe: Corsica; 2 in the Caribbean (the Lesser Antilles): Guadeloupe and Martinique; 1 in South America: French Guiana; and 2 in the Indian Ocean near East Africa: Mayotte and Réunion). They are traditionally divided between the metropolitan regions, located on the European continent, and the overseas regions, located outside the European continent. Both have the same status and form the most integrated part of the French Republic.

==== Metropolitan regions ====
, metropolitan France is divided into the following:

* 13 regions, including Corsica; although Corsica is formally a single territorial collectivity, it is considered equivalent to a region (local authority).
* The regions are subdivided into 96 departments (local authority).
* The departments are subdivided into 320 arrondissements (not a public or legal entity).
* The departments are subdivided into 1,995 cantons (not a public or legal entity).
* The departments are subdivided into 34,826 communes (local authority).
** Three urban communes (Paris, Marseille, and Lyon) are further divided into municipal arrondissements. There are 20 arrondissements of Paris, 16 arrondissements of Marseille, and 9 arrondissements of Lyon.
** The city of Marseille is also divided into 8 municipal sectors. Each sector is composed of two arrondissements.
** There are also 710 associated communes (), formerly independent communes which were merged with larger communes but have retained some limited degree of autonomy (e.g., the commune of Lomme which was absorbed by Lille in 2000 and transformed into an &quot;associated commune&quot; inside the commune of Lille).

Furthermore, , there exist 2,585 intercommunal structures grouping 34,077 communes (93.2% of all the communes of metropolitan France), with 87.4% of the population of metropolitan France living in them. These intercommunal structures are:

* 16 urban communities (&quot;communautés urbaines&quot;, or CU)
* 167 agglomeration communities (&quot;communautés d&#x27;agglomération&quot;, or CA)
* 2,397 commune communities (&quot;communautés de communes&quot;, or CC)
* 21 metropolises (&quot;métropoles&quot;), established in 2014, aimed at the largest cities and their suburbs.
* 5 Syndicates of New Agglomeration (&quot;syndicats d&#x27;agglomération nouvelle&quot;, or SAN), a category being phased out

==== Overseas regions ====
Five overseas regions (&quot;régions d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;, or ROM), which have the same status as metropolitan regions. The overseas regions are as follows:

# French Guiana
# Guadeloupe
# Martinique
# Mayotte
# Réunion

* Each overseas region is coextensive with an overseas department (&quot;département d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;, or DOM), again with the same status as departments in metropolitan France. The first four overseas departments were created in 1946 and preceded the four overseas regions, Mayotte became a DOM in 2011. The dual structure of overseas region and overseas department, with two separate assemblies administering the same territory, results from the extension of the regional scheme to the overseas departments in the 1970s. Each overseas region or department may transform into a single territorial collectivity, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies, which voters in Martinique and French Guiana approved in two referendums in 2010. In Réunion, the creation of a second department for the southern part of the island has been debated for some time.
* The overseas departments are subdivided into 12 arrondissements (Mayotte does not have arrondissements).
* The 12 arrondissements are further subdivided into 153 cantons with Mayotte having another 19 cantons.
* The 172 cantons are composed of 129 communes. (In the five DOM, there are more cantons than communes, unlike in metropolitan France, because many communes are divided into several cantons, whereas in metropolitan France in general cantons are made up of several communes, except in large communes like Toulouse or Lille which are divided into several cantons.)
*Furthermore, as of 1 January 2009, there exist 16 intercommunal structures in the overseas departments, grouping 89 communes (79.5% of all the communes of the overseas departments), with 83.2% of the population of the overseas departments living in them intercommunal structures. These intercommunal structures are:
** 7 agglomeration communities
** 9 commune communities

=== Overseas collectivities, semi-autonomous territories ===


The French Republic includes five overseas collectivities (, or COM) with a semi-autonomous status:

# French Polynesia
# Saint Barthélemy
# Saint Martin
# Saint Pierre and Miquelon
# Wallis and Futuna

* French Polynesia (designated as an &quot;overseas country&quot;, French: ) is divided into 5 administrative subdivisions (). For elections, it is divided into six electoral districts (), which differ slightly from the 5 administrative subdivisions. The 5 administrative subdivisions are divided into 48 communes. There also exist some associated communes as in metropolitan France.
* Saint Barthélemy (designated as a &quot;collectivity&quot;, French: ) is a new overseas collectivity created on 22 February 2007. It was previously a commune inside the Guadeloupe department. The commune structure was abolished, and Saint Barthélemy is now one of only three permanently inhabited territories of the French Republic with no commune structure. There are no cantons and arrondissements either.
* Saint Martin (designated as a &quot;collectivity&quot;, French: ) is also a new overseas collectivity created on 22 February 2007. It was also previously a commune inside the Guadeloupe department. The commune structure was abolished and Saint Martin is now one of only three permanently inhabited territories of the French Republic with no commune structure. There are also no cantons or arrondissements.
* Saint Pierre and Miquelon (designated as a &quot;territorial collectivity&quot;, French: , the same designation as Corsica, a region and not an overseas collectivity) is divided into 2 communes with no arrondissements or cantons.
* Wallis and Futuna (designated as a &quot;territory&quot;, French: ) is divided into 3 districts (), which exactly match the three traditional chiefdoms () with their traditional kings still at their head, the only kings currently recognized in the French Republic. These 3 districts are Uvea, Sigave, and Alo. Uvea is the most populous and is further divided into 3 wards ( in French): Hahake, Mua, and Hihifo. Wallis and Futuna is one of only three permanently inhabited territories of the French Republic with no communes (the others being Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin). It also has no arrondissements or cantons.

=== New Caledonia, an autonomous territory ===
The French Republic includes one autonomous collectivity:

# New Caledonia

New Caledonia&#x27;s status is unique in the French Republic: it is the only French local government that is not a territorial collectivity (although its subdivisions are territorial collectivities). It is regarded as a sui generis collectivity, which means that local government and parliament have the power to pass and enforce specific laws without seeking the consent of the French Government; unless such laws are declared illegitimate by the Constitutional Council in a specific proceeding brought to the Constitutional Council. As agreed in the 1998 Nouméa Accord, a New Caledonian citizenship was established (in addition to the French citizenship which is kept in parallel, along with the consequent European citizenship) and a self-determination referendum was held in 2018. Two follow-up referendums were held in 2020 and 2021.

* It is divided into 3 provinces.
* The provinces are subdivided into 33 communes.

=== Territories without civilian population ===
These territories have no permanent civilian population. The residents consist of military personnel, scientific researchers, and support staff.

====Overseas territory====
1 overseas territory (, or TOM): the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, which have no permanent population and no communes.

* The French Southern and Antarctic Lands are divided into five districts ( in French):

# &quot;Adélie Land&quot;
# Crozet Islands
# Kerguelen Islands
# Saint Paul Island and Amsterdam Island
# The Scattered Islands (), a collection of five non-permanently inhabited island groups in the Indian Ocean: Bassas da India, Europa Island, the Glorioso Islands (including Banc du Geyser), Juan de Nova Island, and Tromelin Island. These were previously administered separately but they have been combined into the French Southern and Antarctic Lands since February 2007.

====Uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France====
* Clipperton Island: an uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico which is directly under the authority of the Minister of the Overseas in Paris (until February 2007 it was administered by the high-commissioner of the French Republic in French Polynesia). Since the Scattered Islands were also combined with the French Southern and Antarctic Lands in February 2007, Clipperton Island is now the only island left in this category.

== Territorial collectivities ==

French subdivisions that have a (limited) freedom of administration are called territorial collectivities. Among them are regions, departments, communes, overseas collectivities, provinces (only present in New Caledonia), and the territorial collectivity of Corsica which belongs to no category (but is usually grouped with the regions). New Caledonia is unique as it is not a territorial collectivity.

==General rules==
Citizens from all parts of France, including the overseas administrative divisions, vote in national elections (presidential, legislative), and all of the collectivities are represented in the Senate.

==Responsibilities==

Some areas are the clear responsibility of one level of government (e.g. the state is responsible for international issues), but in other areas it is shared across some or all levels of government (e.g. transport, parks, tourism, culture, and sport get different types of support from different levels).

* The national government is responsible for the military, foreign policy, immigration, economic policy, environment, agriculture, food and drug safety, health insurance, the justice system, National Police, military police (National Gendarmerie), Paris region emergency services, higher education, research, and national support for culture and sport
* Regions cannot write their own laws, but can raise taxes and are responsible for high schools, public transit, universities and research, and assistance to business owners.
* Departments are responsible for junior high schools, social and welfare allowances, local roads, school and rural buses, and a subsidy for municipal infrastructure.
* Communes are responsible for local roads, municipal police, water management, and garbage collection, vital records, local prosecutions, local elections, and registration for civil service and elections.

<text>The cantons of France () are territorial subdivisions of the French Republic&#x27;s departments and arrondissements.

Apart from their role as organizational units in relation to certain aspects of the administration of public services and justice, the chief purpose of the cantons today is to serve as constituencies for the election of members of the representative assemblies established in each of France&#x27;s territorial departments (departmental councils, formerly general councils). For this reason, such elections were known in France as &quot;cantonal elections&quot;, until 2015 when their name was changed to &quot;departmental elections&quot; to match the departmental councils&#x27; name.

As of 2015, there were 2,054 cantons in France.

Most of them group together a number of communes (the lowest administrative division of the French Republic), although larger communes may be included in more than one canton, since the cantons – in marked contrast to the communes, which have between more than two million inhabitants (Paris) and just one person (Rochefourchat) – are intended to be roughly equal in size of population.

The role of the &quot;canton&quot; is, essentially, to provide a framework for departmental elections. Each &quot;canton&quot; elects a woman and a man to represent it at the &quot;conseil départemental du département&quot; – or departmental council for the &quot;department&quot;, which is the principal administrative division of the French Republic.

In urban areas, a single &quot;commune&quot; generally includes several &quot;cantons&quot;. Conversely, in rural areas, a &quot;canton&quot; may comprise several smaller &quot;communes&quot;. In the latter case, administrative services, the &quot;gendarmerie&quot; headquarters for example, are often situated in the principal town () of the &quot;canton&quot;, although there are exceptions, such as &quot;cantons&quot; Gaillon-Campagne and Sarreguemines-Campagne, which have in common a &quot;chief-town&quot; which does not belong to either &quot;canton&quot;.

For statistical (INSEE) purposes, the twenty arrondissements of Paris – the administrative subdivisions of that city – are sometimes considered &quot;cantons&quot;, but they serve no greater electoral function.

&quot;Cantons&quot; also form legal districts, as seats of &quot;Tribunaux d&#x27;instance&quot; (&quot;TI&quot;) or Courts of First Instance. Historically, the &quot;cantons&quot; are called &quot;justices de paix&quot; or &quot;district courts&quot;.

== History ==
The &quot;cantons&quot; were created in 1790 at the same time as the &quot;départements&quot; by the Revolutionary Committee for the Division of Territory (&quot;Comité de division&quot;). They were more numerous than today (between 40 and 60 to each &quot;département&quot;).
&quot;Cantons&quot; were, at first, grouped into what were called &quot;districts&quot;. After the abolition of the &quot;district&quot; in 1800, they were reorganized by the Consulate into &quot;arrondissements&quot;. The number of &quot;cantons&quot; was then drastically reduced (between 30 and 50 units) by the &quot;Loi du 8 pluviôse an IX&quot; (28 January 1801), or the &quot;Law for the Reduction of the Number of District Courts&quot;, or &quot;Loi portant réduction du nombre de justices de paix&quot; in French. The &quot;département&quot; prefects were told by the government to group the &quot;communes&quot; within newly established &quot;cantons&quot;. The &quot;département&quot; lists, once approved by the government, were published in the &quot;Bulletin des lois&quot; in 1801 and 1802; these lists were the basis of the administrative divisions of France from then until 2015, although &quot;cantons&quot; with small populations were eliminated and new &quot;cantons&quot; created in areas of strong demographic growth. On the whole, their number increased appreciably.

In May 2013 a law was adopted that reduced the number of cantons drastically. This law came into effect at the French departmental elections in March 2015. Before the cantonal reform, there were 4,032 cantons; afterwards there were 2,054, with the cantons in Martinique and Guyana abolished. The 2013 reform law also changed the representation of the cantons in the departmental councils: each canton is now represented by a man and a woman.

== Statistics ==
The number of &quot;cantons&quot; varies from one &quot;département&quot; to another. The Territoire de Belfort has the fewest at 9, while Nord has the most at 41. The average figure is about 21.

<text>Sulina () is a town and free port in Tulcea County, Northern Dobruja, Romania, at the mouth of the Sulina branch of the Danube. It is the easternmost point of Romania.

==History==
During the mid-Byzantine period, Sulina was a small cove, and in the 14th century, a Genoese port inhabited by a handful of sailors, pirates and fishermen. In the 18th century, the Ottomans built a lighthouse there in order to facilitate communication between Constantinople (Istanbul) and the Danubian Principalities, the main breadbaskets for the Ottoman capital.

Thanks to the signing of the Treaty of Adrianoupolis (Edirne) on September 2, 1829, that unfettered the Danube grain trade, Sulina, by then under Russian control, became an important port. Great sailing boats could not sail fully loaded to Brăila and Galați, which were the main export centers of Wallachia and Moldavia, because of the shallow waters of the river; therefore, they had to transship at least part of their cargoes to smaller riverboats (shleps). The owners and crew of these shleps were almost always Greek.

Even greater development occurred after the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1856), which ended the Crimean War. One of the treaty&#x27;s terms determined the establishment of the European Commission of the Danube (CED), which would conduct infrastructure works on the mouth of the river in order to make it navigable for larger ships as well. The technical works allowed entrance to the Danube for a great number of &quot;foreign&quot;, i.e. non-Greek ships, leading to a higher level of competition. River trading, however, largely remained in Greek hands. The declaration by the Ottoman administration of Sulina as a free port in 1870 also boosted its development.

The Russo-Ottoman war of 1877–1878 led to many changes as well. The city was initially put under Russian control and after the signing of the Berlin Treaty was annexed to Romania, as was the whole Dobruja area. According to an 1878 estimate, the town then had a total population of 800, consisting of 350 Greeks, 150 Turks, 50 Romanians, 50 Russian Old Believers and 200 others. During World War I the city served as base for the Romanian cruiser &quot;Elisabeta&quot;, whose actions kept the Danube Delta under Romanian control throughout the war.

In November 1916, the German submarine &quot;UC-15&quot; was sent on a minelaying mission off Sulina and never returned, being sunk by her own mines. This was probably caused by an encounter with the Romanian torpedo boat &quot;Smeul&quot;, whose captain surprised a German submarine near Sulina in November 1916, the latter reportedly never returning to her base at Varna. This could only have been &quot;UC-15&quot;, whose systems most likely malfunctioned after being forced to submerge in the shallow waters, upon encountering the Romanian torpedo boat.

In World War II, the Soviet M-class submarine &quot;M-59&quot; was sunk by mines laid off Sulina by the Romanian minelayers &quot;Amiral Murgescu&quot;, &quot;Regele Carol I&quot; and &quot;Dacia&quot;.

==Climate==
Sulina has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;). 
==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, the town has 3,118 inhabitants. At the 2011 census, 82.82% of the population were Romanians, 11.43% Lipovans, 1.8% Greeks, 1.29% Ukrainians, and 2.3% of other or undeclared ethnicity. At the 2002 census, 93.0% spoke Romanian and 5.7% Russian as their first language. 94.3% were Orthodox, and 5.1% Old Believers.

At the 1930 census, 47.2% were Romanians, 20.8% Greeks, 17.7% Lipovans, 3.3% Serbs, 3.0% Turks, 1.6% Jews, 1.0% Germans, and 5.4% others.

<text>Curtea de Argeș () is a city in Romania on the left bank of the river Argeș, where it flows through a valley of the Southern Carpathians (the Făgăraș Mountains), on the railway from Pitești to the Turnu Roșu Pass. It is part of Argeș County. The city also administers one village, Noapteș.

On 7 July 1947 the total rainfall in Curtea de Argeș was in 20 minutes, which is a world record.

== Etymology and names ==
The present name, literally &quot;The Court upon (river) Argeș&quot;, refers to the former status of the town as the capital of Wallachia. Some historians identify the Argeș River with ancient &quot;Ordessos&quot;, however the name is unlikely to be derived from this name. The oldest Slavonic documents use an &quot;Arghiș&quot; form, which might suggest a Cuman or Pecheneg etymology, from the root &quot;arghiš&quot; (&quot;higher ground&quot;, &quot;heights&quot;).
The original name was Argeș, which was then used for the name of the river as well.

== History ==
=== Capital of Wallachia ===

One of the oldest towns in Wallachia, Curtea de Argeș was the capital of a small local state which was the start for the unification of the lands south of the Carpathians. The oldest archeological evidence of it being the seat of such a ruler date from the 13th century.

Câmpulung was the seat of Basarab I, the voivode of Wallachia, who was first mentioned in a document written in 1324 at the court of Charles I of Hungary. The next year, a conflict broke out between the two and in 1330, Charles I organized an expedition against the &quot;unfaithful&quot; Basarab and destroyed the Argeș stronghold.

The tradition of Wallachian chronicles differ from the Hungarian documents: they don&#x27;t mention Basarab I and instead, they claim that Argeș was founded in 1290 by Radu Negru who crossed the Carpathians from Transylvania to found the cities of Curtea de Argeș and Câmpulung.

While Câmpulung is sometimes credited as the first capital of Wallachia, the Wallachian chronicles mention only Curtea de Argeș as being the capital, this being supported by the fact that the Hungarian documents mention that Charles I attacked the Argeș stronghold and not the Câmpulung one.

After 1340, a new royal court was built at Argeș, containing a palace and a church, the whole compound having an area of . It was here that the Metropolitan Orthodox Church of Wallachia was founded in 1359.

The town traded with Transylvania, focusing on the town of Sibiu, to which it had a direct road crossing the Olt Valley and . The commercial area of the town was around the court and the &quot;St. Nicholas in Târg&quot; Church, where the &quot;bazar&quot; was located.

===Decline===
This Argeș court was the residence of the Wallachian hospodars until Mircea I of Wallachia, included. The following rulers used both Argeș and Târgoviște as the seats of the court and traveler Johann Schiltberger mentioned that in 1396 both cities were capitals.

From 1396 to 1460, Wallachia was tributary to the Sunni-Islamic Ottoman Empire, the hospodars being vassals of its Great Sultan.
During the 15th century, their court was used alternately with the one in Târgoviște, but in the 16th century, the capital was completely moved to Târgoviște and the Argeș court was rarely visited.

Argeș was one of the most important towns in Wallachia in the 14th and 15th centuries, but starting with the 16th century, its importance began to fade. The Orthodox Metropolitan&#x27;s seat was moved to Târgoviște in 1517, while the Catholic bishopric ended its activity in 1519. A fall in the trade with Sibiu and Brașov also led to a population decline.

After the Curtea de Argeș Monastery was built during the rule of Neagoe Basarab, the rulers of Wallachia favored it and, apart from donations (part of the town&#x27;s domain), they gave it rights over the town. The monastery presided over trials in the marketplace and it was allowed to build customs house and mills. This eroded the autonomy of the town and led to further economic slump.

===Modern era===
The united country&#x27;s first modern king, Carol I of Romania renovated the Curtea de Argeș Monastery and designated it as a royal necropolis in 1886. Curtea de Argeș became the burial place for the Royal House of Romania (a branch of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen dynasty), including Carol I, Ferdinand I and Queen Marie, and Michael I and Queen Anne. King Carol I also built a railway linking Curtea de Argeș to Bucharest; the city&#x27;s railway station, designed by architect and constructed by engineer Elie Radu in 1898, stands out as one of the distinctive architectural masterpieces of the city.

The Ștefănescu-Goangă brothers, Mihail and Florian, contributed to modernizing the city&#x27;s infrastructure during 1920s and 1930s. As a mayor, Mihail Ștefănesu Goangă oversaw the building of the city&#x27;s first paved roads, post office, and central market. Florian Ștefănescu-Goangă founded the summer school of the Babeș-Bolyai University in Curtea de Argeș, which later became the , one of the most prestigious high schools in Romania.

During the Communist regime, state-led industrialization led to the construction of several major factories in the city, which became a major producer of agricultural proteins, porcelain, and textiles. During the 1990s, most of the communist-era industries closed down, but Curtea de Argeș remains a manufacturing center for textiles and high-end fashion.

== Ecclesiastical History ==

=== Latin Bishopric of Argeș ===
In the first decades of the 14th century, a group of German Catholics from Saxony were brought under the authority of the Catholic bishop of (Hungarian) Transylvania and they were settled in the city. In 1381, the Latin Diocese of Argeș was founded as then-only Catholic bishopric in Wallachia, suffragan of the Hungarian Metropolitan Archdiocese of Kalocsa. No incumbent names are available.
It was suppressed in 1519/20 (just after the Orthodox Metropolis), its territory being used in 1590 to establish the Diocese of Bacău.

In the 17th century the bishopric moved to Bacău due to the decrease in the number of local Catholics.

=== Orthodox Archbishopric of Argeș ===

A Greek Orthodox archbishopric of Argeș was established in 1396, under authority of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople by Callistus I, but disputed by the Bulgarian Patriarchate of Ochrid.

The Orthodox Metropolitan&#x27;s seat was moved to Târgoviște in 1517, just before the Catholic bishopric ended its activity.

However, at the close of the 18th century, it again became the seat of the modern Romanian Orthodox Archdiocese of Argeș and Muscel, under the Metropolis of Wallachia and Dobrudja.

=== Landmark churches ===

The city is the site of several medieval churches (among them the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral) having been an Orthodox bishopric again since the close of the 18th century.

The most important church is the Princely Church of Saint Nicholas built by Basarab I, completely renovated in 2003–2004. It resembles a stone fortress, connected through catacombs to a guard tower on a nearby hill. Ruins of the Prince&#x27;s Palace Complex are still visible. It is mentioned in Alexandru Odobescu&#x27;s &quot;Doamna Chiajna&quot;. 
One of the most enduring and famous Romanian legends, the legend of Meșterul Manole, is related to the monastery&#x27;s construction.

<text>The Parliament of India or Indian Parliament, (ISO: ) is the supreme legislative body of the Government of India. It is a bicameral legislature composed of the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People). The president of the Republic of India, in their role as head of the legislature, has full powers to summon and prorogue either house of Parliament or to dissolve the Lok Sabha, but they can exercise these powers only upon the advice of the prime minister and the Union Council of Ministers.

Those elected or nominated (by the president) to either house of the Parliament are referred to as members of Parliament (MPs). The members of parliament in the Lok Sabha are directly elected by the voting of Indian citizens in single-member districts and the members of parliament in the Rajya Sabha are elected by the members of all state legislative assemblies by proportional representation. The Parliament has a sanctioned strength of 543 in the Lok Sabha and 245 in the Rajya Sabha including 12 nominees from the expertise of different fields of literature, art, science, and social service. The Parliament meets at Sansad Bhavan in New Delhi. The Parliament of India represents the largest democratic electorate in the world (the second being the European Parliament), with an electorate of 968 million eligible voters in 2024. On 28 May 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, unveiled and inaugurated the New Parliament Building (Sansad Bhavan), located adjacent to the previous one.

==History==

During British rule, the legislative branch of India was the Imperial Legislative Council, which was created in 1861 via the Indian Councils Act of 1861 and disbanded in 1947, when India gained independence. Following independence, the Constituent Assembly of India was elected to write the Constitution of India. In 1950 after the constitution came into force, the Constituent Assembly of India was disbanded, and succeeded by the Parliament of India, which is active to this day.

==Parliament House==
===Old premises (Samvidhan Sadan)===
The Old Parliament House (&quot;Samvidhan Sadan&quot;) is located in New Delhi. It was designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, who were made responsible for the planning and construction of New Delhi by the British government, as the home of the Central Legislative Assembly, the Council of State, and the Chamber of Princes. The construction of the building took six years, and the opening ceremony was performed on 18 January 1927 by the viceroy and governor-general of India, Lord Irwin. The construction cost for the building was .

The building is tall, in diameter and covers an area of . The Central Hall consists of the chambers of the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha, and the library hall. Surrounding these three chambers is the four-storied circular structure providing accommodations for members and houses parliamentary committees, offices and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. The center and the focus of the building is the Central Hall. It consists of chambers of the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha, and the Library Hall, and between them lie garden courts. Surrounding these three chambers is the four-storied circular structure providing office spaces for ministers, chairmen, parliamentary committees, party offices, important offices of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariat, and also the offices of the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. The Central Hall is circular in shape and the dome is in diameter.

It is a place of historical importance. The Indian Constitution was framed in the Central Hall. The Central Hall was originally used in the library of the erstwhile Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States. In 1946, it was converted and refurbished into the Constituent Assembly Hall.

===New premises (Sansad Bhavan)===

A new parliament building called the Sansad Bhavan was inaugurated on 28 May 2023. The old building, an 85-year-old structure suffers from inadequacy of space to house members and their staff and is thought to suffer from structural issues. The building also needs to be protected because of its heritage tag. The new building, with a built-up area of approximately 65,000 sq m and a distinctive triangular shape, optimally utilizes space. It houses an expanded Lok Sabha Hall, accommodating up to 888 seats, and a larger Rajya Sabha hall, accommodating up to 384 seats, with the Lok Sabha capable of accommodating up to 1,272 seats for joint sessions of Parliament. The Lok Sabha Hall draws inspiration from India&#x27;s national bird, incorporating a peacock theme, while the Rajya Sabha hall is designed with a lotus theme, reflecting India&#x27;s national flower. Additionally, a state-of-the-art Constitutional Hall symbolically and physically places Indian citizens at the heart of democracy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation for the new Parliament building on 10 December 2020. With an estimated cost of 9.71 billion, the new building was inaugurated in 2023. The first session in the New Parliament took place on 19 September 2023.

==Composition==
The Indian Parliament consists of two houses, namely, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, with the President of India acting as their head.

===President of India===
The President of India, the head of state, is a component of Parliament vide of the Constitution. Under and of the constitution, the president&#x27;s responsibility is to ensure that laws passed by the Parliament adhere to the relevant constitutional provisions and that the Constitution&#x27;s stipulated procedures are followed before granting approval to bills. The president of India is elected by the elected members of the Parliament of India and the state Legislative Assemblies and serves for a term of five years.

===Lok Sabha===

The Lok Sabha (House of the People) or the lower house has 543 members. Members are directly elected by citizens of India on the basis of universal adult franchise representing parliamentary constituencies across the country. Between 1952 and 2020, two additional members of the Anglo-Indian community were also nominated by the president of India on the advice of the Indian government, which was abolished in January 2020 by the 104th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2019.

Every citizen of India who is over 18 years of age, irrespective of gender, caste, religion, or race and is otherwise not disqualified, is eligible to vote for members of the Lok Sabha. The constitution provides that the maximum strength of the Lok Sabha be 550 members. The Lok Sabha has a term of five years. To be eligible for membership in the Lok Sabha, a person must be a citizen of India and must be 25 years of age or older, not hold any office of profit under union or state government, mentally sound, should not be bankrupt, and should not be criminally convicted. The total elective membership is distributed among the states in such a way that the ratio between the number of seats allotted to each state and the population of the state is, so far as practicable, the same for all states. Out of 543 seats of Lok Sabha, 84 seats are reserved for Scheduled castes and 47 seats are reserved for Scheduled tribe.

===Rajya Sabha===

The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) or the Upper House is a permanent body not subject to dissolution. One-third of the members retire every second year and are replaced by newly elected members. Each member is elected for a term of six years. Its members are indirectly elected by elected members of legislative assembly of the states. The Rajya Sabha can have a maximum of 250 members. It currently has a sanctioned strength of 245 members, of which 233 are elected from states, and union territories and 12 are nominated by the president. The number of members from a state depends on its population. The minimum age for a person to become a member of the Rajya Sabha is 30 years. There are no caste-based reservations in Rajya Sabha.

== Powers ==
As the primary institution responsible for lawmaking, the Indian Parliament possesses a wide array of powers that form the backbone of the country&#x27;s democratic governance.
* Legislative Powers:
*# Enacting Laws: The Parliament is vested with the authority to make laws on subjects enumerated in the Union List and Concurrent List under the Constitution of India. Bills can be introduced in either house, and upon approval, they become laws after receiving the President&#x27;s assent
*# Amending the Constitution: The Parliament can amend the Constitution with the support of a special majority, allowing for modifications to accommodate changing societal needs and aspirations.
*# Residuary Powers: The Parliament holds exclusive authority over matters not covered by the Union or State Lists, known as residuary powers.
* Financial Powers:
*# Formulation and Approval of the Union Budget: The Parliament plays a vital role in the development and endorsement of the Union Budget. It carefully examines the government&#x27;s proposals for revenue generation and expenditure, provides suggestions for modifications if necessary, and ultimately grants or withholds financial allocations accordingly.
*# Taxation: Parliament has the power to levy and collect taxes, including income tax, customs and excise duties, and goods and services tax (GST).
*# Control over Public Expenditure: The Parliament scrutinizes government expenditure through debates and discussions on budgetary allocations, ensuring accountability and transparency.
* Executive Powers:
*# Council of Ministers: The Parliament exercises executive powers indirectly through its control over the Council of Ministers. The government is collectively responsible to the Parliament, and its policies and actions are subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
*# Vote of No Confidence: The Parliament can remove the government from power through a vote of no confidence. If the government fails to enjoy the majority&#x27;s support (in Lok Sabha), it must resign.
*# Questions and Motions: Members of Parliament have the right to raise questions, seek clarifications, and move motions regarding the functioning of the government and its policies.
* Oversight Powers:
*# Question Hour: Members of Parliament can ask questions of ministers during the Question Hour, seeking clarifications on matters of public interest.
*# Committees: The Parliament appoints various committees, such as the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), the Estimates Committee, and the Committee on Public Undertakings, to oversee and examine government policies, programs, and their implementation.
*# Impeachment Power: The Parliament has the authority to initiate impeachment proceedings against the President, Vice President, and Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts for the violation of the Constitution.

==Sessions==
The period during which the House meets to conduct its business is called a session. The constitution empowers the president to summon each house at such intervals that there should not be more than a six-month gap between the two sessions. Hence the Parliament must meet at least twice a year. In India, the Parliament conducts three sessions each year.
* Budget session: The Budget Session is arguably the most crucial session of the Indian Parliament. It typically commences in February and concludes in May. The primary objective of this session is to discuss, debate, and pass the annual Union Budget, which outlines the government&#x27;s fiscal policies and priorities for the upcoming financial year. Members of Parliament scrutinize the budget proposals, propose amendments, and engage in comprehensive discussions to ensure transparency and accountability in the allocation of funds.
* Monsoon session: The Monsoon Session of Parliament usually takes place between July and August. It derives its name from the occurrence of the monsoon season during this time. This session primarily focuses on enacting legislation, as it provides an opportunity for Members of Parliament to introduce bills, engage in extensive debates, and collectively decide on their passage. Apart from legislative functions, this session also involves discussions on various issues of national importance, enabling the government to address concerns raised by the opposition and seek their support.
* Winter session: The Winter Session, held between November and December, serves as the last parliamentary session of the calendar year. Its main purpose is to ensure a comprehensive review of the government&#x27;s policies and initiatives, allowing Members of Parliament to critically analyze their effectiveness. This session witnesses the introduction of bills, discussions on pending legislation, and the examination of the government&#x27;s performance through questions, motions, and debates. The Winter Session is vital for fostering accountability and transparency in governance.
* Special Sessions&quot;:&quot; In addition to the regular sessions, the Indian Parliament also holds special sessions to address urgent matters or crises that require immediate attention. These sessions are convened outside the usual schedule and are dedicated to discussing specific issues of national importance. Special sessions provide a platform for focused deliberations, enabling swift decision-making and action in response to emergencies or critical circumstances.

==Functions==

=== Legislative functions ===
Legislative proposals are brought before either house of the Parliament in the form of a bill. A bill is the draft of a legislative proposal, which, when passed by both houses of Parliament and assented to by the president, becomes an act of Parliament. Money bills must originate in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can only make recommendations over the bills to the House, within a period of fourteen days.

==Parliamentary committees==

Parliamentary committees are formed to deliberate specific matters at length. The public is directly or indirectly associated, and studies are conducted to help committees arrive at the conclusions. Parliamentary committees are of two kinds: standing committees and ad hoc committees.

Standing committees are permanent committees constituted from time to time in pursuance of the provisions of an act of Parliament or rules of procedure and conduct of business in Parliament. The work of these committees is of a continuing nature. Ad hoc committees are appointed for a specific purpose, and they cease to exist when they finish the task assigned to them and submit a report.

== Privileges ==
Parliamentary privileges play a crucial role in safeguarding the functioning of the Indian Parliament and upholding its authority as the primary legislative body in the country. These privileges grant certain rights and immunize Members of Parliament, enabling them to perform their duties effectively, express their views freely, and ensure democratic accountability.
* &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot;: One of the most fundamental parliamentary privileges is the freedom of speech and expression granted to Members of Parliament. This privilege allows legislators to articulate their opinions and viewpoints without fear of legal consequences or outside interference. By protecting freedom of speech, parliamentary privileges ensure that parliamentarians can openly debate, discuss, and criticize government policies and actions, thus contributing to robust decision-making and democratic governance.
* &quot;Immunity from Legal Action&quot;: Parliamentary privileges grant lawmakers immunity from civil and criminal proceedings for any statements made or actions performed within the Parliament or its committees. This immunity allows Members of Parliament to express their opinions and engage in debates without the fear of legal repercussions. By safeguarding parliamentarians from external legal actions, these privileges facilitate open and uninhibited discussions, fostering an environment conducive to the free exchange of ideas.
* &quot;Access to Information&quot;: Parliamentary privileges also encompass the right to access information necessary for effective legislation and oversight. Members of Parliament have the authority to seek information from government officials, ministries, and public authorities to gather facts, scrutinize policies, and hold the government accountable. This privilege enables parliamentarians to obtain critical data, documents, and reports to make informed decisions and represent the interests of their constituents effectively.
* &quot;Control over Internal Affairs&quot;: Parliamentary privileges grant the legislature the power to regulate its internal affairs, proceedings, and discipline. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha exercise these privileges to maintain decorum, ensure orderly debates, and enforce rules of procedure. This control over internal affairs allows the Indian Parliament to function independently, protect its integrity, and maintain its authority as a legislative body.
* &quot;Protection from Arrest&quot;: Parliamentary privileges provide Members of Parliament with protection from arrest in civil cases during the session of Parliament, allowing them to discharge their legislative responsibilities without hindrance. This privilege ensures that lawmakers can attend parliamentary sessions, participate in debates, and fulfill their duties without the threat of detention or interference.

==Code of conduct==
To uphold the principles of transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct, the Indian Parliament focuses on some of the key behavioral aspects for parliamentarians.
* To maintain transparency:

# Parliamentarians should disclose their financial interests, including assets, investments, and sources of income, to ensure transparency and prevent conflicts of interest.
# Detailed records of parliamentary proceedings, including debates, voting records, and committee activities, should be made readily available to the public for scrutiny and accountability.
* Conflict of Interest:
*# Parliamentarians should avoid conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from discussions or decisions that may directly or indirectly benefit them, their family members, or their associates.
*# A clear definition of conflicts of interest and guidelines for disclosure and recusal are outlined to maintain the integrity of the legislative process.
* Respectful Discourse:
*# Parliamentarians should engage in respectful and constructive debates, adhering to decorum and avoiding personal attacks or derogatory language.
*# Speeches and interactions should be focused on the issues at hand, fostering a culture of healthy deliberation and informed decision-making.
* Attendance and Participation:
*# Parliamentarians should demonstrate a high level of commitment to their duties by attending sessions regularly and actively participating in debates, voting, and committee work.
*# Guidelines are established to ensure that absenteeism is minimal, and absence without valid reasons is addressed appropriately.
* Use of Parliamentary Privileges:
*# Parliamentarians should exercise their parliamentary privileges responsibly, recognizing that they are not immune to legal and ethical obligations outside the Parliament.
*# Misuse of privileges, such as obstructing justice or engaging in corrupt practices, are strictly prohibited and subjected to legal consequences.
* Accountability:
*# Parliamentarians are accountable to the public they represent, regularly communicating with constituents, listening to their concerns, and addressing their grievances.
*# A mechanism for public redressal and feedback are established to hold parliamentarians accountable for their actions and decisions.
* Prohibition of Corruption:
*# Parliamentarians should be bound by stringent anti-corruption measures, including the declaration of assets, income, and liabilities, and strict adherence to existing anti-corruption laws.
*# Strong penalties and disciplinary action should be imposed for any proven instances of corruption or unethical behavior, reinforcing a culture of integrity and zero tolerance for malpractice.
In 2022, the Lok Sabha secretariat released a booklet listing out unparliamentary words and expressions before the start of the Monsoon session on 18 July 2022. The banned words if used during debates or otherwise in both the houses would be expunged from the records of the parliament.
==Incidents==
===2001 Terrorist attack===
On 13 December 2001, the Indian Parliament was attacked by an Islamic terrorist group. The perpetrators were Lashkar-e-Taiba (Let) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists. The attack led to the deaths of five terrorists, six Delhi Police personnel, two Parliament Security Services personnel, and a gardener, which totaled 14 fatalities. The incident led to increased tensions between India and Pakistan, resulting in the 2001-02 India–Pakistan standoff.

===2023 Security breach===
On 13 December 2023, two protestors breached the new premises of parliament and entered the Lok Sabha section. The security breach was organized by six protestors. Two of the accused, Sagar Sharma and D Manoranjan, jumped into the chamber from the visitor&#x27;s gallery, and opened a yellow smoke canister, in an attempt to reach the Speaker&#x27;s Chair. While outside the parliament, two others, Neelam Devi and Amol Shinde, allegedly opened an aerosol canister, releasing a colored smoke.

The sixth individual, Vishal Sharma, was caught meters away from the parliament after filming and uploading the video of the protest outside Parliament to the social media platforms. The alleged leader of the protestors was Lalit Jha, who is affiliated with the Samyabadi Subhas Sabha, a non-governmental organisation in West Bengal, and calls himself a teacher on his Instagram profile. The Delhi police told the court that it was a well-planned conspiracy, and that the accused might also be associated with terrorist organisations. While the police have not officially revealed a motive, both media reports and statements from the families of the accused suggest that the protesters sought to articulate their frustration with the government&#x27;s policies. 

Rashtriya Loktantrik Party founder Hanuman Beniwal along with some MPs caught and overpowered the intruder and became ‘hero’ or ‘saviour’ of the Parliament. Beniwal told the media soon after - &quot;&quot;Herogiri unki utar di, trans. taught them a lesson]”.&quot; Beniwal soon after incident questioned BJP government on national security and called it a ‘big security lapse’ and demanded a thorough investigation. He also highlighted the timing, coinciding with the 22nd anniversary of the 2001 Indian Parliament attack.

Day after the security breach, Trinamool MP Derek O&#x27;Brien of the Rajya Sabha and 13 MPs of Lok Sabha from the Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam parties, were suspended until 22 December for protesting by bringing placards and hindering the proceedings of the parliament by demanding answers regarding the security breach and the home minister&#x27;s statement. A week after the breach, 78 more MPs were suspended, most of them part of the INDI alliance, after protesting the security breach.

<text>Oltenița () is a city in Călărași County, Muntenia, Romania, on the left bank of the river Argeș, where its waters flow into the Danube.

==Geography==
The city is located in the southwestern part of the county; it stands across the Danube from the Bulgarian city of Tutrakan.

The national road DN4 connects Oltenița to Bucharest, to the northwest. Road connects it to the county seat, Călărași, to the east, and road connects it to Giurgiu, to the west.

The Oltenița train station, located near the intersection of those three roads, serves the CFR Line 801, which connects the city to Bucharest (Titan Sud and Obor stations).

==History==
Excavations on Gumelnița hill near the city revealed a Neolithic settlement dating from the 4th millennium BC.

The first mention of a town bearing the name Oltenița appears in 1515 during the reign of Neagoe Basarab.

In November 1853, at the start of the Crimean War the Ottoman forces attempted to cross the river at this point and inflicted heavy losses on the Russian forces at the Battle of Oltenița.

During the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878, Oltenița was an important crossing point into Bulgaria for Romanian troops called to aid the Russian Army during the siege of the Pleven (&quot;Plevna&quot;) stronghold.

During World War I at Turtucaia, across the Danube from Oltenița, Battle of Turtucaia ended in a significant defeat for the Romanian Army and subsequently the garrisons of Oltenița and Turtucaia engaged in numerous artillery skirmishes.

==Education==
There are three high schools in Oltenița: Neagoe Basarab National College, Ion Ghica Technologic High School, and Nicolae Bălcescu Technologic High School.
==Sports==
Stadionul Municipal is the home ground of the football club CSM Oltenița and holds 2,500 people.

<text>Ming Yuzhen (; 2 October 1328 – 17 March 1366) was a peasant rebel leader who established the dynasty of Ming Xia during the late Yuan dynasty in China.

Ming was born in Suizhou (today Sui County, Hubei) in a farmer family. He changed the character of his surname to mean &quot;Brilliance&quot; later. In 1353 he joined the Red Turbans, a rebel group led by Xu Shouhui. He was blinded in the right eye during a battle.

In 1360, Xu was killed by Chen Youliang, so Ming left his group and proclaimed himself King of Longshu (隴蜀王). Two years later, he proclaimed himself Emperor of Great Xia in Chongqing, with the era name of &quot;Tiantong&quot; (天統). In Great Xia, there was taxation, imperial examination, and a state religion of Buddhism.

In 1363, he attacked Prince Liang, Bolud Temür (孛羅帖木兒) in Yunnan. His plans to expand did not work out and he died in of illness at the age of 35. He was succeeded by his son Ming Sheng (明昇), who changed the era name to &quot;Kaixi&quot; (開熙) and was exiled to Korea when Longshu was destroyed by the Ming Empire in 1371. The Korean official Yun Hui-chong&#x27;s daughter married Ming Sheng in March 1373. Ming Sheng was 17 and Chen Li was 21 when they were sent to Korea in 1372 by the Ming dynasty.

Also, Ming Yuzhen is the founder of Korean clans, the Yeonan Myeong clan, Seochok Myeong clan and Namwon Seung clan.

<text>Râmnicu Sărat (also spelled &quot;Rîmnicu Sărat&quot;, , or &quot;Rebnick&quot;; ) is a city in Buzău County, Romania, in the historical region of Muntenia. It was first attested in a document of 1439, and raised to the rank of &quot;municipiu&quot; in 1994.

The city rises from a marshy plain, east of the Carpathian Mountains, and west of the cornlands of southern Moldavia. It lies on the left bank of the river Râmnicul Sărat. Salt and petroleum are worked in the mountains, and there is a considerable trade in agricultural produce and preserved meat.

==History==
Râmnicu Sărat was the scene of battles between the Wallachians and Ottomans in 1634, 1434, and 1573.

It was also here that, in 1789 (during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792), an army of Imperial Russian and Habsburg troops, commanded by Alexander Suvorov, defeated the Ottoman forces in the Battle of Rymnik. For this victory, Suvorov was awarded the victory title of &quot;Count of Rymnik&quot; or &quot;Rimniksky&quot; (граф Рымникский) by empress Catherine the Great of Russia.

In 1854, Râmnicu Sărat was almost destroyed by fire and was rebuilt. From 1864 to 1950 (with the exception of 1938–1940), the city was the seat of Râmnicu Sărat County. From 1901 to 1963, the Râmnicu Sărat Prison operated in the city.

<text>Chen Youliang (陳友諒; 1320 – 3 October 1363) was the founder and first emperor of the dynastic state of Chen Han in Chinese history. He was one of the military leaders and heroes of the people&#x27;s revolution at the end of the Yuan dynasty.

==Biography==
Chen was born to a fishing family in Mianyang (沔陽) in present-day Hubei. Some say he was born with surname Chen (陳), while others say he was born with surname Xie (謝).

Vietnamese records say that Chen Youliang was the son of Chen Yiji (陳益稷) or Trần Ích Tắc, a Trần dynasty leader who settled in the Yuan dynasty.

In his childhood, he grew up poor, and he and his family were relatively unsuccessful fishermen. Chen once served as a district official before becoming a general under Ni Wenjun during the Red Turban Rebellion. Ni Wenjun planned to assassinate Xu Shouhui, the Red Turban rebels&#x27; leader, but Chen Youliang killed Ni Wenjun before Ni could kill Xu. At this time, Chen Youliang took over Fujian and Jiangxi. Upon hearing that Jiangxi had been captured, Xu Shouhui wished to move the capital there, but Chen Youliang feared that Xu Shouhui would threaten him there and sent an envoy to stop him. Still Xu and his troops arrived in Jiangxi, so he later turned on Xu Shouhui and assassinated him.

In 1357, Chen proclaimed himself &quot;King of Han&quot; in Jiangzhou (江州; present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi), and emperor after Xu Shouhui died. His era name, as well as his empire&#x27;s name, was &quot;Da Han&quot; (大漢; literally &quot;Great Han&quot;). Chen Youliang appointed Zou Pusheng (邹普胜) as Grand Preceptor and Zhang Bixian (张必先) as prime minister (丞相).

From 1359 to 1363 Chen&#x27;s fleet was the strongest on the upper Yangtze River. His power was at least as great as that of another rebel state, Wu, led by Zhu Yuanzhang, founder of the Ming dynasty.

In 1360 the Han fleet and army began a long war against Wu forces. At that time, the Wu forces were based in Jiqing (present-day Nanjing). The Wu was later renamed &quot;Ming&quot; in 1368. An attack on the Wu capital was defeated thanks to excellent Wu intelligence (likely due to the defection of part of the Han fleet earlier in the year). The war continued until the climactic Battle of Lake Poyang where the Wu fleet narrowly defeated the larger fleet of Han after three days of fighting.

A month after the battle at Lake Poyang, the Han fleet tried to break out from Lake Poyang. During the resulting ship battles Chen was killed (he was alleged to have died from an arrow wound in the head). He was 43 years old at the time of his death in 3 October 1363.

As his crown prince Chen Shan (陳善) had been captured, Chen Youliang was succeeded by his second son, Chen Li, who was soon attacked by the fleet and army of Wu. The conquest of Han took an additional two years but by April 1365 the Han empire was gone and all its lands were now part of the Wu power base.

==Family==
*Grand-ancestors: Chen Qianyi (陈千一)
*Father: Chen Pucai (陳普才) became Marquis of Cheng&#x27;en (承恩侯) by Zhu Yuanzhang after the downfall of Han
*Mother: from the Wu clan (吴氏)
*Brothers:
**Chen Youfu (陈友富) would be promoted to the title Marquis of Guiren (归仁伯) by Zhu Yuanzhang
**Chen Youzhi (陈友直) would be promoted to the title Marquis of Huaien (怀恩伯) by Zhu Yuanzhang
**Chen Youren (陳友仁), KIA in the Battle of Poyang Lake
**Chen Yougui (陳友貴), KIA in the Battle of Poyang Lake
*Spouses: Chen Youliang had several concubines respectively surnamed Yang (杨), Lou (娄), Tao (陶) and Du (阇). Consort Du was captured along with Chen Shan. Concubines Yang and Lou predeceased Chen Youliang.
*Children:
**Chen Shan (陈善), Crown Prince, joined Ming army
**Chen Li, his successor, started Yangsan Jin clan of Korea
*Grandchildren
**Chen Mingshan (陈明善), a descendant in Korea

===Controversial relationship with Trần Ích Tắc===
Vietnamese historical annals such as &quot;Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư&quot; recorded that Chen Youliang sent a diplomatic delegate to Đại Việt to ask for alliance, claiming that he had biological relationship with Trần dynasty (Trần is the Vietnamese pronunciation of Chen 陳). Chen claimed to be the biological son of Trần Ích Tắc (1254–1329; 66 years older than Chen Youliang), a Trần royal member who defected to the Yuan forces during the second invasion of Vietnam. However, Chinese history annals did not record any such relationship, instead claimed that Chen Youliang&#x27;s ancestor originally have the family name as &quot;Xiè&quot; (謝), later was married into a certain Chen clan and changed his name to the maternal family. Chen Youliang also descended from a fishermen family in Hubei, meanwhile Trần Ích Tắc was appointed as a court magistrate in Huguang, hence it was unlikely that a high-rank magistrate like Ích Tắc had a fishermen son. It is suspected that Chen Youliang pretended to be a Vietnamese royal family to earn support from Đại Việt.

The Trần dynasty, however, did not to respond to Chen&#x27;s request. Trần Ích Tắc was considered a traitor and was legally removed from the Trần royal family, it is unlikely for Đại Việt to ally with a traitor&#x27;s descendant. Đại Việt also had no reason to intervene into the affairs of her northern neighbor.

== Evaluations ==
Through his established empire Chen Han, Chen Youliang is remembered as a revolutionary, even hero, who helped resist Yuan rule and pave the way for the new Ming dynasty.

* Liu Ji: &quot;Youliang&#x27;s territory included Rao Prefecture and Xin Prefecture; and spanned from the Jing to the Xiang, nearing half of the world. Shicheng is occupied with defending himself against the barbarians, hence he is not a worry to us. Youliang betrayed his lord and threatens his subordinates; he has no legitimacy. He occupies the upriver territory, and we are always on his mind; hence, we should take him first. After the Chen family is eliminated, the Zhang family is isolated, and can be eliminated with one fell swoop.&quot;
* Zhu Yuanzhang: &quot;After Youliang&#x27;s death, the world was not difficult to pacify.&quot; &quot;I find Youliang to be arrogant and Shicheng to be narrow-minded; the arrogant are prone to conflicts, while the narrow-minded lack far-sighted plans.&quot;
* Yang Jing: &quot;In the past Chen and Zhang occupied the Wu and Chu regions, built boats to plug rivers, accumulated grain to cross mountains, built their armies and called themselves invincible. However, after the battle in Poyang, Youliang was killed, and Chen turned his army toward the east, while Zhang surrendered. This is not man&#x27;s choice; it is in fact destiny. &quot;
* Rao Hanxiang: &quot;Vanguard of the Jiang-Han, awe-inspiring man of the Three Chu regions.&quot; (“江汉先英、三楚雄风。”) 
* Cai Dongfan: &quot;I said that Youliang caused his own defeat. Jiangzhou was lost, his base was gone, and he fled to Wuchang; at this point he should build his army and bid his time. But he was impatient, put all his eggs in one basket, lost his children, lost his favorite mistress, and even died himself, becoming a mockery for the world. It is obvious that the rise and fall of a state is really related to man&#x27;s choices. One should not be like Xiang Yu who, at the moment of his suicide in Wujiang, claimed that he had never lost a battle.&quot;
* Historian Wu Han: &quot;Although Chen Youliang failed, he was, after all, a hero who opposed the rule of the Mongolian and Han landlord classes in the Yuan dynasty. He played a role in history. At that time, people sympathized with him and missed him. His grave is still preserved under the newly built Yangzi River Bridge for visitors to mourn.&quot;

== Memorial ==
Also see Tomb of Chen Youliang (陈友谅墓), a cenotaph (衣冠冢).

=== Tomb ===
On 3 October 1363, after Chen Youliang died in the Battle of Poyang Lake, his real remains disappeared. His clothes were taken back by his subordinates in a boat and sent to the south slope of Sheshan, approaching the Wuchang Bridge Head (武昌桥头) of Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan City, Hubei Province (next to the Yellow Crane Tower, a famous scenic spot in Wuhan, Hubei Province) for burial.

It faces south, has a rectangle with rounded corners and a height of 2.2 meters. The tomb base is 12 meters long. The tomb is built on the mountain. Here is There is a hexagonal unknown pavilion nearby, and the pillars of the pavilion are engraved with handwriting.

In the Qing dynasty, this place became a part of the garden &quot;Naiyuan&quot; (乃园) of Hubei Provincial Bureau of Supervision, and few people visited it. In 1908, Wan Yaohuang and Geng Zhongzhao discovered this tomb in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu in Qing dynasty.

In 1912, Hubei Provincial Department of Internal Affairs requested renovation, and built a 16-step tomb road and a tall archway in front of the tomb (between the archway and the tomb). On the forehead of the memorial archway, &quot;Jiang Han Xian Ying&quot; (&quot;江汉先英”), and on the back, &quot;San Chu Xiongfeng&quot; (“三楚雄风&quot;), a monument was erected in front of the tomb, &quot;Da Han Chen Youliang Tomb&quot;, and Rao Hanxiang of Guangji made an inscription. There is also a tablet pavilion on each side of the tomb. In 1913, the cemetery was renovated and surrounded by pines and cypresses.

In 1923 (after the Revolution of 1911), the Republic of China rebuilt it.

In 1949, after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, it was slightly repaired.

In 1956, the tomb was listed as a cultural relic protection unit in Hubei Province.

It was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the local government allocated funds to restore it. In June 1998, it was completely renovated, with brick cement tomb walls and the monument of &quot;Rebuilding Dahan Chen Youliang Tomb&quot;.

=== Memorial Palace ===
At 9:00 on 18 December 2013, the local government opened the &quot;Chen Youliang Memorial Hall&quot; (陈友谅纪念馆) at 90 Pier, Mian Street, Xiantao City, Hubei Province (formerly Mianyang, Hubei Province). This memorial hall has three floors of antique buildings, covering an area of 3,891 square meters, with a total construction area of 1,615 square meters. The first two floors have an exhibition hall of 920 square meters, and the last floor is an office rest area.

== Legends ==
Yuan Mei&#x27;s &quot;Zi Bu Yu&quot; (袁枚《子不語》), Volume 10, contains an article &quot;Destroying Chen Youliang Temple&quot;, which tells the story of the ruined Jingzhou Chen Youliang Temple when Zhao Xili (赵锡礼) was appointed as a county magistrate. Zhao only knew that it was an unknown Wangye Temple, and thought it was an obscene temple and destroyed the temple, but he didn&#x27;t know that the temple was dedicated to Chen Youliang, and he didn&#x27;t know it until he asked Zhang Tianshi (张天师).

<text>Xu Shouhui () (1320–1360) was a 14th-century Chinese rebel leader who proclaimed himself emperor of the Tianwan (天完) dynasty during the late Yuan dynasty period of China. He was also known as Xu Zhenyi (徐真一 or 徐真逸, romanized in Wade–Giles as Hsü Chen-i).

Born in Luotian (羅田, now in Hubei), Xu was a cloth vendor by profession.

==Emperor==
In August 1351, he worked with others in Qízhōu () to establish the rebel army of Red Turbans under the pretense of the Buddhist White Lotus Society. In the following months of the Red Turban Rebellion, they captured Qishui () and made it the command centre of the Red Turbans and the capital of the newly declared Empire of Tianwan (), originally called Song () with himself as the emperor with the era name of &quot;Zhiping&quot; ().

The number of his supporters increased rapidly as he claimed to be Maitreya Buddha () who sought to &quot;destroy the rich to benefit the poor&quot; (). In 1352, he invaded more of Hebei, and moved on to take Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Hunan.

After being temporarily defeated by the army of the Yuan dynasty, he fled to Huangmei Mountain (), but returned in 1355 to invade once again and move the capital to Hanyang District.

In 1358, after Chen Youliang took control of the city Longxing (now Nanchang 南昌市), Xu Shouhui wanted to move the capital from Hanyang to Longxing. Chen Youliang opposed this idea, as Longxing was not far from Jiangzhou, which would make Xu Shouhui a threat to him. However, Xu Shouhui insisted on the relocation, and in December of 1359 ordered his troops to sail down the Yangtze River to Jiangzhou. Anticipating this, Chen Youliang ordered his men to lay an ambush to the city. Once Xu Shouhui arrived, he and his men fell ambush and Chen Youliang detained him, killing the rest of his men before proclaiming himself King of the State of Han. Xu Shouhui would die shortly in 1360 in Chen Youliang&#x27;s captivity, however, it is not known if he was executed or died from an illness.

<text>Dorohoi () is a city in Botoșani County, Romania, on the right bank of the river Jijia, which broadens into a lake on the north. The city administers three villages: Dealu Mare, Loturi Enescu, and Progresul.

==History==
Dorohoi used to be a market for the timber and farm produce of the north Moldavian highlands; merchants from the neighboring states flocked to its great fair, held on the June 12. The settlement is first mentioned in documents from 1408, where a treaty was signed between Moldavian voievode, Alexandru cel Bun, and the King of Poland and Hungary.

Dorohoi was bombed by the Russians during World War I.

Dorohoi used to be the capital of Dorohoi County, but was downgraded to a municipality when the Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in late June 1940. On July 1, 1940, units of the Romanian Army attacked local Jews in a pogrom. These military actions against the Jews were not endorsed by the Romanian Government. When the conspiracy against the Jews was discovered by the military command, troops were sent to end the abuse.

==Geography==

===2010 Romanian floods===
The northeastern town of Dorohoi witnessed deaths during the night of June 28–29, 2010 as floods rose to just over in some places. Several roads into Dorohoi remained either washed away or under water. The heavy rain that had been falling for close to a week had forecasters warning that it would continue in northeast Romania. The unusually heavy rain killed 6 people, most in the town of Dorohoi on the 29th.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Dorohoi had a population of 22,893. At the census from 2011, the city had a population of 22,600, of which 98.13% were ethnic Romanians, 1.54% ethnic Romani, 0.07% ethnic Jews, and 0.02% ethnic Ukrainians.

=== Jews of Dorohoi ===
Jews first settled in Dorohoi in the 17th century. It was set up as a Jewish Guild under Moldavia. Jews suffered here during World War I:
*There were 600 Jewish families in Dorohoi in 1803.
*3,031 people in 1859 (roughly half of the population).
*6,804 in 1899 (more than half of the population).
*5,800 in the 1930s.

The Jewish population actually increased after the Holocaust as a result of refugees settling there. In 1947, there were 7,600 Jews living in Dorohoi. Following the establishment of Israel, the Jewish population of Dorohoi steadily decreased, due to emigration. In 1956, there were 2,753 Jews; in 1966, there were 1,013; and by 2000, there were only 49 Jews left in Dorohoi.

<text>Calafat () is a city in Dolj County, southern Romania, in the region of Oltenia. It lies on the river Danube, opposite the Bulgarian city of Vidin, to which it is linked by the Calafat-Vidin Bridge, opened in 2013. After the destruction of the bridges of late antiquity, for centuries Calafat was connected with the southern bank of the Danube by boat, and later by ferryboat.

The city administers three villages: Basarabi, Golenți, and Ciupercenii Vechi.

==History==
It was founded in the 14th century by Genoese colonists. These colonists generally employed large numbers of workmen (&quot;Calafatis&quot;) in repairing ships. This industry gave the town its name.

In January 1854, during the Crimean War, when Russian forces were headed up the Danube, Ahmed Pasha, commanding the Turkish forces at Calafat, made a surprise attack on the temporary Russian garrison nearby Cetate, which was under the command of Colonel . This diverted the initial Russian attack and allowed Ahmed Pasha to consolidate his forces in Calafat. On 28 January, the Russians under the command of General Joseph Carl von Anrep, reached Calafat and began the siege which lasted until May. Riddled by disease and unable to take the town, Anrep withdrew.

Calafat was declared a municipiu in 1997.

== Climate ==


==Transport==
Calafat lies on the river corridor VII-Danube and the pan-European corridor IV, which starts in Germany and ends in Istanbul and Thessaloniki. The city is at the crossroads of National Roads DN56, DN56A, and DN55A and European route E79. The city of Calafat and its neighbour, Vidin (Bulgaria), are linked by a bridge over the Danube in the area called Bașcov (Danube Bridge 2), built by the Spanish company FCC. The project of constructing a Danubian bridge in the area of Calafat–Vidin dates back to 1925. Road traffic between Vidin and Calafat was doubling every year, so it became necessary to construct a bridge with four lanes of road traffic, a railway line, a lane two meters wide for bikes and a pavement for pedestrians. The bridge has a total length of and its cost is estimated at US$200 million. It was officially opened on 14 June 2013.

==Newspapers==

Calafat has several city newspapers. One of them is called &quot;Ziarul De Calafat&quot;, which is also maintained online; another one is &quot;Calafat Live&quot;.

==International relations==
===Twin towns — Sister cities===
Calafat is twinned with:
* Vidin, Bulgaria
* Zaječar, Serbia
* Biñan, Philippines

<doc id="410254" wikidata="Q801455" url="?curid=410254" title="Southern Cross railway station">
<text>Southern Cross railway station (until 2005 known as Spencer Street station) is a major railway station in Docklands, Melbourne. It is on Spencer Street, between Collins and La Trobe streets, at the western edge of the Melbourne central business district. The Docklands Stadium sports arena is north-west of the station.

The station is owned, operated and maintained by Civic Nexus, a subsidiary of IFM Investors and operating as Southern Cross Station Pty Ltd, under a 30-year lease to 2036 from the Victorian State Government, as part of a public-private partnership. Southern Cross Station contracts Infranexus for management services. Infranexus is also wholly owned by IFM.

The station is the terminus of the state&#x27;s regional railway network, operated by V/Line, &quot;The Overland&quot; rail service to Adelaide, and NSW TrainLink XPT services to Sydney. It is also served by metropolitan rail services, operated by Metro Trains, and connects with Flinders Street station and the underground City Loop. It is the second-busiest railway station in Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network, with 14.019 million metropolitan passengers recorded in 2023/24 and 5.925 million regional passengers through the V/Line network.

Southern Cross also has a coach terminal underneath the Spencer Outlet shopping complex. SkyBus services to Melbourne Airport and since 2017 to Avalon Airport operate from there, as well as Firefly Express and Greyhound Australia interstate coach services, and V/Line coach services to Mildura, Yarram, Mansfield, and other parts of Victoria not served by rail.

== History ==

Opened as Spencer Street station in 1859, five years after the other major Melbourne rail terminus at Flinders Street, the station was a dead-end terminus, running parallel to Spencer Street, composed of a single main platform with a dock platform at the north end. It was not until 1874 that an extra platform was provided.

The two major city stations were not linked until 1879, when a single-track ground-level line was opened. It operated only at night, and only for freight trains. In the 1880s, it was proposed that Spencer Street station be removed in order to facilitate the westward expansion of the city, but the plan was subsequently rejected. 

===1880s: Passenger services commence===
The 1880s saw the first of several grand but unrealised plans for the station. The first accepted design, drafted by Albert Charles Cook in 1883, was a fanciful Palladian palazzo design of two and three storeys, with a central portico.

From 1888 to 1894, the layout of the platforms was altered, with new country platforms being built on an angle to Spencer Street itself. The current coach terminal location was the site of a number of new platforms built for suburban services.

In 1891, further plans were made for a significant new station complex, including three-storey office complex and dominant clock tower, reminiscent of the later Sydney Central station, but the 1890s depression put an end to such expensive schemes.

In 1888, work started on the double track Flinders Street Viaduct linking the station to Flinders Street station. The line was initially only used by freight trains, with passenger train operations commencing in 1894. It was at that time that the first through platform was provided at the station, used by suburban trains from Essendon and Williamstown. The viaduct to Flinders Street was expanded to four tracks in 1915 and, following the electrification of the suburban lines through the station, today&#x27;s platforms 11 to 14 were opened in 1924, along with a pedestrian subway providing access to them.

In 1938, it was announced that construction of an improved station entrance and new car park had been approved, designed by architects Messrs Stephenson and Meldrum, costing £2,000. Once again however, no construction took place.

===1960s: Modernisation===
In 1960, work started on a new Spencer Street station, as part of the construction of a new interstate standard gauge line to Sydney, New South Wales. A station building was constructed which largely replaced the 1880s iron sheds, and a new platform number 1 was built. The passenger subway which had been constructed as part of the 1918 works was extended to include access to country platforms. In connection with the construction of the underground loop, platforms 9 and 10 were rebuilt as part of the suburban section of the station, and a new double-track viaduct was constructed between Spencer Street and Flinders Street station, alongside the original one, bringing to six the number of tracks connecting the two stations. At the same time, the four older tracks were resignalled for bi-directional operation.

In 1962, a separate subway network was constructed to carry mail between the station and what was then the Melbourne General Post Office and main postal sorting office, situated on the other side of Spencer Street.

The mechanically interlocked signal box at the station opened in 1887, and was decommissioned in June 2008. Originally built with 120 levers, it had 191 when it closed, making it the world&#x27;s largest.

Artist Harold Freedman&#x27;s long and high &quot;History of Transport&quot; mural featured above the main concourse of the Spencer Street station and was unveiled by the premier of Victoria on 30 January 1978. During radical redevelopment (2002–2006) Freedman&#x27;s mural was removed, but due to bargaining by the CFMEU, it remains on display above shop-fronts in the adjacent retail centre, DFO.

=== 2000s: Redevelopment ===


Southern Cross was redeveloped by the Civic Nexus consortium, following an innovative design by Grimshaw Architects and Jackson Architecture which features an undulating roof. Construction began in October 2002 and was completed in late 2006, with the majority of the transport facilities finished in time for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The central features of the design include a wave-shaped roof, a new entrance and concourse on Collins Street, a new coach interchange, a new food court, a bar/restaurant, separate retail outlets inside the station and a separate shopping complex between Bourke and La Trobe streets.

This new shopping complex originally comprised a Direct Factory Outlet centre, a Virgin Megastore, along with food courts. This opened on 30 November 2006, although not all tenancies were occupied, and stage 2 was opened in March 2007. In 2009 the DFO relocated to a new site at South Wharf, the shopping centre being refitted by owner Austexx and rebranded simply as &quot;Spencer Street fashion station&quot;. In 2013 the shopping complex was rebranded as &quot;Spencer Outlet Centre&quot;.

In addition to the physical modifications, the station was renamed from Spencer Street to Southern Cross on 13 December 2005.

By July 2004, the project had fallen behind schedule and over budget by $200 million. This was covered extensively in the media. As a result of over-runs and design issues, some elements of the original design, including an additional proposed footbridge connecting Lonsdale Street with Docklands Stadium, were scrapped.

Complaints about access to platforms, empty trains occupying space during the day and lack of government support were raised by Leighton Contractors, the construction firm overseeing the project. This led to concerns that the station might not be ready in time for the Commonwealth Games, and the government arranged with the railway operators to provide more access to the work site.

The station&#x27;s redevelopment is part of the wider Melbourne Docklands development. The architect responsible for the design is Nicholas Grimshaw. The structural engineering design was performed by WSP Global. The station has been awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects&#x27; Lubetkin Prize for most outstanding building outside the European Union. The other buildings nominated were the Des Moines Public Library and the Hearst Tower, New York City.

The redevelopment has meant that passengers take more time to get to the suburban network platforms than before. The pedestrian subway access was removed in favour of street level and elevated concourses. The subway also continued underneath Spencer Street, and its closure means it is necessary for all pedestrians to wait for traffic lights to cross Spencer Street at street level. For all suburban and some country services, passengers using the main entrance on the corner of Collins and Spencer Streets have to ascend two escalators to a shopping concourse and then enter the paid area of the station, before descending again to the metropolitan platforms. There have been some accidents in which people have fallen from this elevated level. The ascent and descent is more than necessary to clear the height of trains, and more than the descent and ascent of the previous subway.

Local architects have cited some of the Southern Cross station&#x27;s shortcomings: the building&#x27;s poor connection to the surrounding streets; its awkward juncture at the pedestrian bridge that links Spencer Street to Docklands Stadium; and the baffling manner in which the grand architectural gesture of Southern Cross Station tapers off into an uninspired homage to the boxy 1980s shopping centre—Spencer Outlet Centre.

In 2024, air quality data for Southern Cross station was released for the first time, showing that nitrogen dioxide levels have exceeded the World Health Organization&#x27;s guidelines by 90 times; respiratory experts stated that both short-term and long-term human health is put at risk due to the high air pollution, which is caused by diesel emissions from regional trains and coaches at the station. Civic Nexus, the operator of the station, and the state government state that Southern Cross station meets Australian air quality guidelines. Civic Nexus added that they had no further comment, following a previous enquiry regarding the station&#x27;s air quality in 2007.

=== 2010s: Additional platforms ===
As part of the Regional Rail Link project an extra two platforms (15/16) were constructed and opened in December 2013. These are divided into 15a, 15b, 16a and 16b. They are often used for Gippsland Services, and the lines that use the RRL tracks to Sunshine (Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo lines). These platforms allow trains to avoid the North Melbourne Flyover, which is an inconvenience for trains as it has a maximum speed of , and has shown to cause abnormal wheel wear on the VLocity fleet, as confirmed by an independent report commissioned by V/Line in 2016 to find out the cause of the problem, which ultimately led to up to a month of cancellations of services.

=== Water Tower Clock ===
In May 2014, the historic Water Tower Clock was installed in the concourse of the station. The clock had originally been erected in 1882 at Flinders Street station, opposite the end of Elizabeth Street, atop a lattice tower about high. In 1902 the clock was moved to Princes Bridge station, and in 1910 it was relocated again, to Spencer Street station, where it remained until it was removed as part of the station&#x27;s redevelopment in the mid-1960s. The clock mechanism was given to Museum Victoria, but the characteristic turret that housed the clock was sold to a scrap metal merchant. It was later rescued by private collectors, and the clock was returned to public ownership, being put on display in 1999 at the Scienceworks Museum, Spotswood. The clock was extensively restored before its return to Southern Cross, but the original mechanism remains in the collection of Museum Victoria.

<text>The Imperial Guard (French: &quot;Garde Impériale&quot;) was the imperial guard formation of the French Imperial Army. Under the direct command of Napoleon, the formation expanded considerably over time and acted as his personal bodyguard and tactical reserve. The Imperial Guard was divided into a general staff and infantry, cavalry and artillery regiments along with battalions of sappers and marines. It distinguished between experienced veterans and less experienced members by being separated into three formations: the Old Guard, Middle Guard and Young Guard. The Young Guard was virtually annihilated in the Battle of Krasnoi during the French invasion of Russia.

==History==
The Guard had its origin in the Consular Guard (&quot;Garde des consuls&quot;), created on 28 November 1799 by the union of the Guard of the Directory (&quot;Garde du Directoire exécutif&quot;) and the Grenadiers of the Legislature (&quot;Grenadiers près de la Représentation nationale&quot;). These formations had for principal purpose the security of the executive and legislative branches of the French Republic and gathered a small number of soldiers, about a thousand. The Consular Guard changed its name to the Imperial Guard on 18 May 1804. Its headquarters were located at the Pentemont Abbey in Paris.

Napoleon took great care of his Guard, particularly the Old Guard. The Grenadiers of the Old Guard were known to complain in the presence of the Emperor, giving them the nickname &quot;Les&quot; &quot;Grognards&quot;, the Grumblers. The Guard received better pay, rations, quarters, and equipment, and all guardsmen ranked one grade higher than all non-Imperial Guard soldiers. Other French soldiers even referred to Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard as &quot;the Immortals&quot;.

The Guard played a major part in the climax of the Battle of Waterloo. It was thrown into the battle at the last minute to salvage a victory for Napoleon. Completely outnumbered, it faced terrible fire from the British lines, and began to retreat. For the first (and only) time in its history the Middle Guard retreated without orders. At the sight of this, Napoleon&#x27;s army lost all hope of victory. The Middle Guard broke completely but the Old Guard (and some of the Young Guard) battalions held their formation and secured the retreat of the remainder of the French Army before being almost annihilated by British and Prussian artillery fire and cavalry charges.
The phrase &quot;&quot;La Garde meurt mais ne se rend pas!&quot; (&quot;The Guard dies but does not surrender!&quot;) is generally attributed to General Pierre Cambronne. It has been suggested that this was in fact said by another general of the Guard, Claude-Étienne Michel, during their last stand at the Battle of Waterloo. The retort to a request to surrender may have been &quot;&quot;La Garde meurt, elle ne se rend pas!&quot; (&quot;The Guard dies, it does not surrender!&quot;). Letters published in &quot;The Times&quot; in June 1932 record that it may have been said by General Michel.

The Old Guard regiments were assigned to the Guard&#x27;s 3rd Division, while the remainder of the Guard&#x27;s foot regiments were assigned to the 1st and 2nd Divisions.

==Numbers==
In 1804, the Guard numbered 8,000 men. By the time of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia in 1812, it had swelled to just under 100,000 men. The Guard had its own artillery, infantry and cavalry components just like a normal army corps. The Old Guard was the elite within the wider Imperial Guard.

==General Staff==

Created soon after the creation of the Guard itself, the General Staff by 1806 included the four Colonel-Generals of the four divisions of the Guard, all Marshal of the Empire in field rank. It also included an Inspector of Reviews, a Commissioner of War, 24 aides-de-camp, and other specialist officers, NCOs, and privates.

==Foot regiments==
The Old Guard regiments served in the 3rd Division of the Guard, while the rest of the foot regiments of the Guard served in the 1st and 2nd Divisions.

=== Old Guard ===

====1st Regiment of Foot Grenadiers Musket====
The 1st Regiment of Foot Grenadiers () was founded from the Consular Guard Grenadiers (), which had been formed from the Guards of the Directory. The battalion was made up of the Imperial French Army&#x27;s most experienced and tallest men, and were essentially the army&#x27;s most senior unit. One of two Imperial Guard battalions carried the Imperial Eagle into battle. 
After Napoleon&#x27;s failure in the Invasion of Russia, only a few troops from the initial force remained, and the army had to be rebuilt using Peninsular War veterans.
Napoleon himself, called them &quot;The Immortals Of France&quot;.

====2nd Regiment of Foot Grenadiers====
Raised in 1806 from veterans of the , the was a unit within the Middle Guard. This particular unit was disbanded in 1810 and was replaced by the so-called Dutch Grenadiers until in 1811, upon the upcoming invasion of Russia, the 2nd Regiment of Foot Grenadiers was reraised with 1,500 veteran soldiers. By 1813, the unit was designated to join the Old Guard as a reward of their long service in both Spain and Russia.

====3rd Regiment of Foot Grenadiers====
Originally raised as part of the Dutch Royal Guard when Louis Bonaparte, brother to Napoleon, was made King of Holland. In 1810 the unit was incorporated into the Imperial Guard within the Middle Guard as the 2nd Regiment of Foot Grenadiers (&quot;&quot;). It was disbanded 15 February 1813 after certain issues with staff and personnel, however was re-raised on 8 April 1815 to the replace the Fusilier-Grenadiers de la Garde Impériale. It was finally disbanded on 24 September 1815 after Napoleon&#x27;s Second Abdication.

====4th Regiment of Foot Grenadiers====
The was the last grenadier guard regiment to be raised. Created on 9 May 1815, it saw action at Ligny and Waterloo. It was disbanded on 24 September 1815.

=== Chasseurs ===

====1st Regiment of Foot Chasseurs====

Being the second in seniority within the Imperial Guard Infantry, the was one of the most respected regiments within the ; classed as part of the Old Guard.

====2nd Regiment of Foot Chasseurs====

Raised in 1806, the was disbanded in 1809 and re-raised in 1811 for the invasion of Russia. As part of the Middle Guard, they engaged in numerous battles and by 1813 they were finally raised to be part of the Old Guard.

====3rd Regiment of Foot Chasseurs====
The briefly existed during the 100 days campaign after Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba.

====4th Regiment of Foot Chasseurs====
The was also raised during the 100 days campaign after Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba.

=== Middle Guard ===

====Fusiliers-Grenadiers====
The Fusiliers-Grenadiers were the second regiment of Fusiliers created on 15 December 1806 from the 1st battalions of the Grenadier and Chasseur Vélites, forming a regiment that was to be 1,800 men strong. Conscripts and men from the Compagnies de Reserve brought the new regiment up to four battalions of four companies each, 120 men per company. They were disbanded on 12 May 1814.
====Fusiliers-Chasseurs====
The Fusiliers-Chasseurs were created on 19 October 1806 from the 1st battalions of the Vélites of the Grenadiers and Chasseurs of the Guard; the regiment was to be 1,200 men strong. Men of the Compagnies de Reserve were added to bring the regiment up to four battalions of four companies each, 120 men to a company. In 1813, each battalion was enlarged by two more companies. They were destroyed on 12 May 1814.

=== Young Guard ===

====Tirailleurs-Grenadiers====
The first regiment to become known as the Young Guard, Tirailleurs Grenadiers () were raised in 1809 from conscripts, but they had to be able to read and write. A second regiment was formed later in the same year. In 1810 both were renamed &quot; &amp; &quot;.

====Tirailleurs-Chasseurs====

Two regiments of Tirailleurs-Chasseurs were formed at the same time as the Tirailleurs-Grenadiers, and were also included in the Young Guard. For the 1812 campaign in Russia these were expanded to six regiments. Both became &quot;&quot; &quot;&amp; &quot; in 1811.

During the 1813–14 campaigns the number of &quot;&quot; was increased to sixteen although they rarely equaled the regiments of the Young Guard of 1811.
The 7th, 8th and 9th were recruited from the &#x27;Pupilles de la Garde&#x27;, childsoldiers who were to become Napoleon&#x27;s son&#x27;s guard and who stayed in France during the Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia.

====Voltigeurs====

Created from the Tirailleurs-Chasseurs in late 1810, the &quot;Regiments de Voltigeurs de la Garde Impériale&quot; became one of the largest corps in the Guard, eventually absorbing the &quot;Regiments de Conscrits-Chasseurs&quot; to number sixteen regiments by 1814. The &quot;14e Régiment de Voltigeurs de la Garde Impériale&quot; was created from the Spanish volunteers that retreated with the French Army, and the &quot;Régiment de Voltigeurs de la Garde Royale Espagnol&quot;.

====Conscripts-Grenadiers====
Created in 1809, the two Conscripts-Grenadiers Regiments (&quot;Régiment de Conscrit-Grenadiers&quot;), though intended to provide a reserve for the Young Guard, were not included in the Guard, receiving line infantry pay. The regiments became &quot;3e &amp; 4e Régiment de Tirailleurs de la Garde Impériale&quot; in 1810.

====Conscripts-Chasseurs====

Created in 1809, the Conscripts-Chasseurs Regiment though intended to provide a reserve for the Young Guard, was not included in the guard, receiving line infantry pay. After 1811, the Conscrits-Chasseurs formed the 3rd and 4th regiments of the Voltigeurs of the Guard.

====National Guard Regiment of the Guard====
This regiment was created from the National Guard companies of the northern departments of France. The regiment was organized according to the line infantry tables, and in 1813 was renamed the 7th Regiment of Voltigeurs.

====Flanqueur Grenadiers and Chasseurs====
In preparation for the invasion of Russia, Napoleon ordered a further creation of units for the Guard that included &quot;Régiment de Flanqueurs-Grenadiers de la Garde Impériale&quot; and Flanqueur-Chasseurs Regiment (&quot;Régiment de Flanqueurs-Chasseurs de la Garde Impériale&quot;).


==Cavalry regiments==

The Imperial Guard cavalry constituted a corps in itself and had its own commander, with seasoned cavalrymen like Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières and generals Frédéric Henri Walther or Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty successively at its helm. Augustin Daniel Belliard was also interim commander for a few days in 1814, before giving command to Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta, who held it for a short while, until Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in April 1814. During the Hundred Days, there was no overall commander of the Guard cavalry, with command divided between Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes (light cavalry division) and Claude-Étienne Guyot (heavy cavalry division).

===Horse Grenadiers===

The Horse Grenadiers was the senior cavalry regiment of the Guard, and originated from the Consular Guard. Classed as heavy cavalry, the regiment did not wear a cuirass, but was known for its distinctive bearskin head-dress and black horses. It was known by the nickname of &quot;the Gods&quot;; also as &quot;the Big Heels&quot;.

===Chasseurs à Cheval===
The Regiment of Chasseurs a Cheval (&quot;1er Régiment de Chasseurs-a-Cheval de la Garde Impériale&quot;) was also created from the Consular Guard, and ranked second in seniority, although it was a light cavalry regiment. It was the Chasseurs that usually provided personal escort to Napoleon, and he often wore the uniform of the regiment in recognition of this service. The regiment was not only known for its lavish uniform, but its combat history, as well. A second regiment (&quot;2e Régiment de Chasseurs-a-Cheval de la Garde Impériale&quot;) was created briefly from &quot;Regiment d&#x27;Eclaireurs Lanciers&quot; in 1815.

===Empress&#x27; Dragoons===
The dragoon regiments of the line distinguished themselves in the German campaign of 1805, and so Napoleon decided (in a decree of 15 April 1806) to reorganize the cavalry of the Guard and create within it a regiment of dragoons (&quot;Régiment de Dragons de la Garde Impériale&quot;), made up of three squadrons, headed by 60 officers personally selected by Napoleon. The first squadron was to have 296 men, and be made up of &quot;vélites&quot;, whilst the other two were regular squadrons of 476 horsemen. To complete this new unit, each of the 30 dragoon regiments of the line provided 12 men, each of whom had done 10 years of service, and the brigadier, chasseur, and dragoon line regiments provided the &quot;sous-officiers&quot;. This regiment quickly became known as the &quot;Régiment de dragons de l&#x27;Impératrice&quot; (the Empress&#x27; Dragoons) in tribute to their patroness, Joséphine de Beauharnais, and up until its last member died, the Regiment marked the anniversary of her death.

The unit&#x27;s numbers rose to 1269 in 1807 with the addition of two new squadrons, and on 9 December 1813 it was attached to the Guard&#x27;s 3rd regiment of éclaireurs. The dragoons&#x27; uniform and weaponry was the same as those of the Guard&#x27;s mounted grenadiers, only in green rather than blue, and (in place of the bonnet à poil) a copper helmet with a hanging mane in the Neo-Greek &quot;Minerve&quot; style, and a red plume.

===Éclaireurs===

In the Russian campaign of 1812, the French Army had suffered badly from attacks by the Russian Cossack cavalry. About to fight on French soil for the first time since the French Revolutionary Wars, Napoleon decided to reorganize the Imperial Guard. In Article 1 of a decree of 4 December 1813, he created three regiments of &quot;Éclaireurs à Cheval de la Garde Impériale&quot; (mounted scouts of the Guard) as counterparts to the Cossacks. They were also known as &quot;Hussards Éclaireurs&quot; within the Guard.

They joined the army on 1 January 1814, just in time to participate in the Six Days Campaign, and were disbanded after Napoleon&#x27;s first abdication.

The &quot;1er Regiment d&#x27;Éclaireurs à Cheval&quot; was attached to the &quot;Grenadiers à Cheval&quot;, and was thus named the regiment of &quot;Éclaireurs-grenadiers&quot;.

The &quot;2e Regiment d&#x27;Eclaireurs à Cheval&quot; was attached to the &quot;Dragons de L&#x27;Imperatrice&quot; (Empress&#x27; Dragoons).

The &quot;3e Regiment d&#x27;Eclaireurs à Cheval&quot; was attached to the &quot;1er Régiment de Chevau-Legers-Lanciers&quot;.
===1st (Polish) Regiment of Lancers===
The regiment called the &quot;Régiment de Chevau-Légers Polonais de la Garde&quot; was created in 1807 after the 1806 defeat of the Allies, and the French creation of the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1811, with the raising of the Dutch Lancers of the Guard, the regiment was renamed &quot;1er Régiment de Chevau-Legers-Lanciers de la Garde Impériale&quot;.

===2nd (Franco-Dutch) Regiment of Lancers===

Raised in 1810 from former Dutch Army cavalry units as the &quot;2e Régiment de chevau-légers lanciers de la Garde Impériale&quot;, the regiment became known as the Red Lancers from their uniform.

===3rd (Lithuanian) Regiment of Lancers===

A Light Cavalry Lancers Regiment of the Imperial Guard () was raised in Lithuania from its nobles during the invasion of Russia in 1812, but was virtually destroyed in the retreat of the same year, and the survivors incorporated into . Incorporated into the regiment was a squadron of Lithuanian Tatars as the .

===Mamelukes===
A squadron of Mamelukes (&quot;Escadron de Mamelukes&quot;) returned with Napoleon from the Egyptian Campaign in 1799. They were inducted into the Guard, and usually attached to the &quot;Chasseurs à Cheval&quot;. The squadron was never increased to a regiment in strength. Over the years their casualties were replaced from French cavalry regiments, or from any vaguely Middle Eastern related nationalities.

===Elite Gendarmes===

Although technically classed as cavalry of the Guard, &quot;Legion de Gendarmerie d&#x27;Elite&quot; troops invariably served in detachments with the General Staff of the Guard, Napoleon&#x27;s personal headquarters, and the Guard field camps. The Legion included mounted and dismounted troops, the mounted component being two squadrons.

===Guards of Honour===

The Guards of Honour (&quot;Régiment de Garde d&#x27;Honneur&quot;) were four regiments of light cavalry which Napoleon created in 1813 for his campaigns in Germany to reinforce his Guard cavalry decimated in Russia. The regiments were dressed in the fashion of the hussars. They served alongside the other Guard cavalry, but were not technically part of the Old, Middle or Young Guard.


==Artillery==

Artillery of the Guard included the Foot Artillery Regiment (&quot;Régiment d&#x27;Artillerie à Pied de la Garde Impériale&quot;) batteries, Horse Artillery Regiment (&quot;Regiment d&#x27;Artillerie à Cheval de la Garde Impériale&quot;) batteries, the Artillery Train of the Guard (&quot;Train d&#x27;Artillerie de la Garde Consulaire&quot;) and the Artillery Park of the Guard (&quot;Parc d&#x27;Artillerie de la Garde Impériale&quot;), the latter two created in 1807. Despite shortages in artillery ordnance, in 1813 Napoleon created the &quot;Régiment d&#x27;Artillerie à Pied de la Garde Impériale&quot; of the Young Guard (&quot;Jeune Garde&quot;). The &quot;Parc du materiel de la Garde Impériale&quot; was created in 1813 to supplement the meager resources of the &quot;Bataillon du Train des équipages militaires&quot; after the losses of the 1812 campaign.

==Engineers==
Although not deployed in combat as a unit, the Engineers (&quot;Genie de la Garde Impériale&quot;) created in 1804 as the engineers of the Consular Guard, participated in combat more so than the combat units of the Guard which were usually held in reserve. By 1810 the Chief Engineer officer of the Guard had a company of &quot;Sapeurs de la Garde&quot; (140 sappers), all members of the Old Guard. In 1813 this was increased to two companies, and later one battalion of four companies totaling 400 sappers. The 1st and 2nd companies were classed as Old Guard, while the 3rd and 4th companies as the Young Guard.

==Sailors==

Raised from sailors of the French navy who had distinguished themselves, the battalion of &quot;Marins&quot; wore a distinctive, elaborate uniform resembling that of the hussars. Their officers bore titles of rank derived from their seagoing compatriots, and the overall commander of the marines bore the rank of &quot;Capitaine de Vaisseau&quot;. Their duties including manning boats and other watercraft used by the Emperor.

<doc id="410260" wikidata="Q1090129" url="?curid=410260" title="Duke of Sutherland">
<text>Duke of Sutherland is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom which was created by William IV in 1833 for George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Marquess of Stafford. A series of marriages to heiresses by members of the Leveson-Gower family made the dukes of Sutherland one of the richest landowning families in the United Kingdom. The title remained in the Leveson-Gower family until the death of the 5th Duke of Sutherland in 1963, when it passed to the 5th Earl of Ellesmere from the Egerton family.

The subsidiary titles of the Duke of Sutherland are Marquess of Stafford (created 1786), Earl Gower (1746), Earl of Ellesmere, of Ellesmere in the County of Shropshire (1846), Viscount Trentham, of Trentham in the County of Stafford (1746), Viscount Brackley, of Brackley in the County of Northampton (1846), and Baron Gower, of Sittenham in the County of York (1703). The marquessate of Stafford, the earldom of Gower and the viscountcy of Trentham are in the Peerage of Great Britain, the dukedom, the earldom of Ellesmere and the viscountcy of Brackley in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and the barony of Gower in the Peerage of England. The Duke is also a Baronet, of Sittenham in the County of York, a title created in the Baronetage of England in 1620. Between 1839 and 1963 the Dukes also held the titles of Lord Strathnaver and Earl of Sutherland, both in the Peerage of Scotland. The Scottish titles came into the family through the marriage of the first Duke to Elizabeth Sutherland, 19th Countess of Sutherland.

==Family history==
Thomas Gower was created a baronet, of Sittenham in the County of York, by James I of England in 1620. This title was in the Baronetage of England. His son Thomas, the second Baronet, married Frances, daughter of John Leveson. Their grandson William, the fourth Baronet (who succeeded his unmarried elder brother), assumed the additional surname of Leveson. William married Lady Jane (d. 1696), daughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath and sister of Grace Carteret, 1st Countess Granville (see Earl Granville). Their son John, the fifth Baronet, was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Gower, of Sittenham in the County of York, in 1706. His son, the second Baron, served three times as Lord Privy Seal. In 1746 he was created Viscount Trentham, of Trentham in the County of Stafford, and Earl Gower. Both titles are in the Peerage of Great Britain. His eldest surviving son from his first marriage, Granville, the second Earl, was also a prominent politician. In 1786 he was created Marquess of Stafford in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Stafford married secondly Lady Louisa Egerton, daughter of Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater. His son from his third marriage to Lady Susanna Stewart, Lord Granville Leveson-Gore, was created Earl Granville in 1833, a revival of the title created for his great-great-aunt in 1715.
Lord Stafford was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, George. He married Elizabeth Sutherland, 19th Countess of Sutherland. In 1803 he succeeded to the vast estates of his maternal uncle Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. In 1833 he was created Duke of Sutherland in the Peerage of the United Kingdom for his support for the Reform Act 1832.

==Clearances==

The 1st Duke and Duchess of Sutherland remain controversial for their role in the Highland Clearances, when thousands of tenants were evicted and resettled in coastal villages. This allowed the vacated land to be used for extensive sheep farming, replacing the mixed farming carried out by the previous occupants. This was part of the Scottish Agricultural Revolution. The changes on the Sutherland estate were motivated by two major objectives. The first was to increase the rental income from the estate: sheep farmers could afford much higher rents. The second was to remove the population from the recurrent risks of famine. Historical opinion differs on the relevance and severity of famine years, but most do not dispute that the Highland region remained the only part of mainland Britain that was affected in this way at this time.

The future 1st Duke became the proprietor of the Sutherland Estate (which comprised much of the county of Sutherland) on his marriage to Lady Elizabeth Sutherland, the Countess of Sutherland, in 1785. Despite the conventions of the day, Lady Sutherland retained control of the management of the estate, rather than passing this responsibility to her husband.

The Sutherland Clearances did not start until the 19th century, mainly due to insufficient capital – a problem that was solved when, in 1803, George Leveson-Gower, the future 1st Duke inherited a huge fortune from the Duke of Bridgewater. The remaining delay was that many leases did not expire until 1807 or later, but plans were put together for the interior of the estate to be devoted to large sheep farms, with new settlements to be built for the displaced inhabitants. A tentative start was made to this with the letting of the first big sheep farm at Lairg in 1807, involving the removal of about 300 people. Many of these did not accept their new homes and emigrated, to the dissatisfaction of the estate management and Lady Sutherland.

Lady Sutherland was not happy with the estate factor and, in 1811, replaced him with William Young and Patrick Sellar. Young had a proven track record of agricultural improvement in Moray and Sellar was a lawyer educated at the University of Edinburgh; both were fully versed in the modern ideas of Adam Smith. They provided an extra level of ambition for the estate. New industries were added to the plans, to employ the resettled population. A coal mine was sunk at Brora, and fishing villages were built to exploit the herring shoals off the coast. Other ideas were tanning, flax, salt and brick manufacturing. 

The next clearances were in Assynt in 1812, under the direction of Sellar, establishing large sheep farms and resettling the old tenants on the coast. Sellar had the assistance of the local tacksmen in this and the process was conducted without unrest – despite the unpopularity of events. However, in 1813, planned clearances in the Strath of Kildonan were accompanied by riots: an angry mob drove prospective sheep farmers out of the valley when they came to view the land, and a situation of confrontation existed for more than six weeks, with Sellar failing to successfully negotiate with the protesters. Ultimately, the army was called out and the estate made concessions such as paying very favourable prices for the cattle of those being cleared. This was assisted by landlords in surrounding districts taking in some of those displaced and an organised party emigrating to Canada. The whole process was a severe shock to Lady Sutherland and her advisers, who were, in the words of historian Eric Richards, &quot;genuinely astonished at this response to plans which they regarded as wise and benevolent&quot;.

Further clearances were scheduled in Strathnaver starting at Whitsun, 1814. These were complicated by Sellar having successfully bid for the lease of one of the new sheep farms on land that it was now his responsibility, as factor, to clear. (Overall, this clearance was part of the removal of 430 families from Strathnaver and Brora in 1814 – an estimated 2,000 people.) Sellar had also made an enemy of the local law officer, Robert Mackid, by catching him poaching on the Sutherland&#x27;s land. There was some confusion among the tenants as Sellar made concessions to some of them, allowing them to stay in their properties a little longer. Some tenants moved in advance of the date in their eviction notice – others stayed until the eviction parties arrived.

As was normal practice, the roof timbers of cleared houses were destroyed to prevent re-occupation after the eviction party had left. On 13 June 1814, this was done by burning in the case of Badinloskin, the house occupied by William Chisholm. Accounts vary, but it is possible that his elderly and bedridden mother-in-law was still in the house when it was set on fire. In James Hunter&#x27;s understanding of events, Sellar ordered her to be immediately carried out as soon as he realised what was happening. The old lady died six days later. Eric Richards suggests that the old woman was carried to an outbuilding before the house was destroyed. Whatever the facts of the matter, Sellar was charged with culpable homicide and arson, in respect of this incident and others during this clearance. The charges were brought by Robert Mackid.

As the trial approached, the Sutherland estate was reluctant to assist Sellar in his defence, distancing themselves from their employee. He was acquitted of all charges at his trial in 1816. The estate were hugely relieved, taking this as a justification of their clearance activity. (Robert Mackid became a ruined man and had to leave the county to rebuild his career elsewhere, providing Sellar with a grovelling letter of apology and confession.)

Despite the acquittal, this event, and Sellar&#x27;s role in it, was fixed in the popular view of the Sutherland Clearances. James Loch, the Stafford estate commissioner was now taking a greater interest in the Northern part of his employer&#x27;s holdings; he thought Young&#x27;s financial management was incompetent, and Sellar&#x27;s actions among the people deeply concerning. Both Sellar and William Young soon left their management posts with the Sutherland estate (though Sellar remained as a major tenant). Loch, nevertheless, also subscribed to the theory that clearance was beneficial for the tenants as much as for the estate.

Lady Sutherland&#x27;s displeasure with events was added to by critical reports in a minor London newspaper, the &quot;Military Register&quot;, from April 1815. These were soon carried in larger newspapers. They originated from Alexander Sutherland, who, with his brother John Sutherland of Sciberscross, were opponents of clearance. Alexander, after serving as a captain in the army had been thwarted in his hopes to take up leases on the Sutherland estate and now worked as a journalist in London. He was therefore well placed to cause trouble for the estate.

The (effective) dismissal of Sellar placed him in the role of scapegoat, thereby preventing a proper critical analysis of the estate&#x27;s policies. Clearances continued under the factorship of Frances Suther and the overall control of James Loch. Through 1816 and 1817, famine conditions affected most of the inland areas and the estate had to provide relief to those who were destitute. This altered policy on emigration: if tenants wanted to emigrate, the estate would not object, but there was still no active encouragement.

In 1818 a large (perhaps the largest) clearance program was put into effect, lasting until 1820. Loch gave emphatic instructions intended to avoid another public relations disaster: rent arrears could be excused for those who co-operated, time was to be taken and rents for the new crofts were to be set as low as possible.

The process did not start well. The Reverend David Mackenzie of Kildonan wrote to Loch on behalf of the 220 families due to be cleared from his parish. He challenged the basic premise of the clearance: that the people from an inland region could make a living on their new coastal crofts. Loch was adamant that the removals would go ahead regardless of objections. Yet, at the same time, Suther and the local ground officer of the estate were pointing out to Loch that few of the new crofts were of an acceptable quality. Some tenants were considering moving off the estate, either to Caithness or emigrating to America or the Cape of Good Hope, which Suther encouraged by writing off their rent arrears. More positively, cattle prices were high in 1818. Ultimately, that year&#x27;s clearances passed without serious protest.

The next two years had much bigger clearances: 425 families (about 2,000 people) in 1819 and 522 families in 1820. Loch was anxious to move quickly, whilst cattle prices were high and there was a good demand for leases of sheep farms. There was no resistance in 1819, but Suther, despite precise instructions to the contrary, used fire to destroy cleared houses.

==Estates==
According to the will of the Duke of Bridgewater, the Egerton estates passed on the death of the first Duke of Sutherland to his third but second-surviving son Lord Francis Leveson-Gower, who changed his surname to Egerton by Royal licence. In 1846 he was created Viscount Brackley and Earl of Ellesmere.

The Duke was succeeded by his eldest son and namesake George, the second Duke. In 1839 he also succeeded his mother in the ancient Scottish titles of Earl of Sutherland and Lord Strathnaver. His eldest son, the third Duke, married Anne Hay-Mackenzie, who in 1864 was created Countess of Cromarty, with remainder to their younger sons (see Earl of Cromarty).

His grandson, the fifth Duke, succeeded to the title at the age of 25 in 1913. In 1914 he decided on the outbreak of the First World War that it was unwise to have so much of his riches tied up in land and property. He sold the family&#x27;s Staffordshire estate except Lilleshall Hall and of gardens. He then decided he wanted to live closer to London, and sold the whole package in 1917 to John Lee. The Duke was childless; on his death in 1963, the line of the eldest son of the first Duke failed. He was succeeded in the earldom of Sutherland and lordship of Strathnaver, which could be inherited by females, by his niece Elizabeth. Elizabeth also inherited most of her uncle&#x27;s wealth, but the dukedom and other titles could only be passed on to male heirs, and they were inherited by his third cousin once removed, John Sutherland Egerton, 5th Earl of Ellesmere, who became the 6th Duke of Sutherland as well. He was a great-great-grandson of the first Earl of Ellesmere, third son of the first Duke of Sutherland. He also died childless and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, Francis Ronald Egerton, the seventh and present duke, a grandson of the Hon. Francis William George Egerton, second son of the third Earl of Ellesmere.

Today most of the duke&#x27;s wealth is in the form of the art collection put together by the first duke&#x27;s uncle, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, which had been inherited by the Ellesmere line of the family. In 2003 the new Duke sold Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus Anadyomene&quot; to the National Gallery of Scotland. In 2009 he sold the two other masterpieces by Titian: &quot;Diana and Callisto&quot; and &quot;Diana and Actaeon&quot;, but he is still the owner of other masterpieces, such as a 1657 self-portrait by Rembrandt, the &quot;Bridgewater Madonna&quot; by Raphael and the &quot;Sacraments&quot; series by French master Nicolas Poussin.

==Other family members==
William Gower, youngest son of William the fourth Baronet, was Member of Parliament for Ludlow.

William Leveson-Gower, second son of John, first Baron Gower and grandson of the fourth Baronet, was Member of Parliament for Stafford. Thomas Leveson-Gower, third son of the first Baron, was Member of Parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme. Baptist Leveson-Gower, fourth son of the first Baron, was also Member of Parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Richard Leveson-Gower, fourth son of the first Earl, was Member of Parliament for Lichfield. John Leveson-Gower (1740–1792), sixth son of the first Earl, was an Admiral in the Royal Navy.

Henry &#x27;Shrimp&#x27; Leveson Gower, was born in Titsey Place near Oxted in Surrey, the seventh of twelve sons of Granville William Gresham Leveson-Gower JP DL FSA, by his wife The Hon Sophia Leveson Gower LJStJ (née Leigh). Captain of England Cricket v South Africa in 1909–10, captained England in all three of the Test matches in South Africa. Leveson Gower became an England Test selector in 1909, and was chairman of selectors in 1924 and from 1927 to 1930.

==Seats==
The family seat was originally Lilleshall Hall and later, grander, family seats included Trentham Hall, Dunrobin Castle, and Cliveden. The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Sutherland from the Leveson-Gower family was Trentham Mausoleum, a grade I listed mausoleum in Trentham, Stoke-on-Trent.

In the 19th and early 20th century the family&#x27;s London residence was Stafford House, which was rated as the most valuable private residence in London.

The duke&#x27;s current seat is at Mertoun House in St. Boswells, in the Scottish Borders.

==Coat of arms==
When members of the Leveson-Gower family held the dukedom of Sutherland, the arms were: Quarterly, Gules a Cross Flory Sable (Gower), Azure three Laurel Leaves Or (Leveson); Gules three Mullets Or on a Bordure of the second a Double Tressure flory counterflory of the first (Sutherland); Crest: A Wolf passant Argent collared and lined Or; Supporters: a Wolf Argent plain collared and Line reflexed over the back Or.

Since the passing of the dukedom of Sutherland to the Egerton family in 1963, the 6th Duke and his successors have used the Egerton family coat of arms: Argent a Lion rampant Gules between three Pheons Sable.

<text>Huși (, Yiddish//&quot;Hush&quot;, , German: &quot;Hussburg&quot;) is a city in Vaslui County, Romania, former capital of the disbanded Fălciu County in the historical region of Western Moldavia, Romanian Orthodox episcopal see, and home of some of the best vineyards of Romania. The city is located on a branch of the Iași–Galați railway, west of the Prut River and the border with the Republic of Moldova. As of 2021, it had a population of 25,045.

== History ==

One theory states that Huși was founded in the 15th century by a colony of Hussites, from whom its name would have been derived; this has been disputed by scholars such as Nicolae Iorga and bishop Melchisedec Ștefănescu, who argued that the name of the city is older, originating with the boyar &quot;Hus&quot; (whose name is also rendered as &quot;Husul&quot; or &quot;Husea&quot;), who owned land in the area.

The first document mentioning the city is a letter of December 17, 1487, sent by the Prince of Moldavia, Stephen III the Great, to the influential Saxon traders of Brașov; the text indicates that the letter had been sent from Huși. Soon after, Huși became one of the favorite places of residence of Stephen III, a fact which led to a noted rise in economical and political status for the following period.

Princes who succeeded Stephen—such as Bogdan III cel Orb, Petru Rareș, Iliaș, Alexandru Lăpușneanu, and Ioan Vodă cel Cumplit—also chose Huși as one of their favorite residences, taking into consideration both its wines and the strategic location which allowed an efficient overseeing of several anti-Ottoman campaigns.

In 1598, during the reign of Ieremia Movilă, Huși was established as an episcopal see of the Eastern Orthodox Church, although the Huși cathedral had in fact been built by Stephen III (1491) as the church of his palace there. After 1598, the bishops became the owners of the city and its lands, and were thus the main agents behind the city&#x27;s development.

In 1711, Huși was the place of signing for the Treaty of the Pruth that ended the Russo-Turkish War.

=== Jewish history of Huși ===

According to local tradition, the first Jewish immigrants came to Huși some time after 1484 (documents mention &quot;five families, among them Frisof, Stofler and Gronic&quot;). In 1747 there were about 1,042 Jews in city; cca. 2,500 in 1859; 3,587 in 1897; 2,514 in 1930; 2,100 in 1942; 2,000 in 1992. In 2005, Huși was home to only 25 Jews (0–15 years old: 1 person; 16–35 years old: 3 persons; 36–60 years old: 6 persons; over 60 years old: 10 persons), the result of successive waves of &quot;aliyah&quot; after World War II.

The Jews of Huși have had an important role in the economic development of the city, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries, at a time when the city was considered one of the most important in Moldavia.

The first synagogue (&quot;Beth-Hanidras&quot;, the Great Synagogue) was built in the 18th century. In 1943 there were five synagogues (&quot;Beth-Hanidras&quot;, &quot;Ceaușul Mare&quot;, &quot;Blănari&quot;, &quot;Croitorilor&quot;, &quot;Postelnici&quot;). Only one synagogue serves the Jewish community nowadays. The first Jewish cemetery was founded in 1680, on Călărași Street. The second cemetery was opened in 1880, and it is still in use.

=== Hungarian history of Huși ===
According to some historians, Huși was established by hussite refugees from the Kingdom of Hungary in the 15th century. The town itself has a significant role in Hungarian history because the first Hungarian Bible translation was written in Huși. Its copies can be found in the Vienna-codex and the Apor-codex. During the Counter-Reformation the Hussite citizens were converted to Catholic faith; nevertheless, in the 17th century the majority of the town were Hungarian-Saxon Catholics. As archbishop Bandinus wrote in 1648 &quot;the inhabitants here are Hungarians and Romanians; Hungarians are in the majority. They share the leading positions between them: if in one year the judge is Hungarian, next year a Romanian will be the judge, so the leaders are changed alternately. The Hussites until now sang in Hungarian at holy masses and liturgies, what was a bad practice in that time. We arranged this in order to satisfy the need of the people, that the holy liturgies will be performed in Latin, and before and after the mass the hymns should be sung in Hungarian, to satisfy the devotion of the people.

In the early 2000s, a village on the river Prut had twelve Hungarian houses, but because of many difficulties the Hungarian people immigrated to the Tatar land, to the town called Csoborcsok, and others to Huși so the region remained abandoned. Catholics were 682 in number, and they had a Szekler priest named Michael Rabczony.&quot; After the 19th century, assimilation reached the Catholic population of Huși. In 1898 Gheorghe I. Lahovary wrote that the Hungarians numbered 1,838 out of total 12,600, however, they only spoke Romanian. In 1930, the town had 3,983 Catholics but only 324 Hungarian citizens. The result of assimilation that today only 9 Hungarians (out of 5,826 Roman Catholics) live in Huși. 

==Demographics==
In 2000, the city&#x27;s population was 33,320, more than double the 1900 population of 15,404. The 2011 census counted 24,997 inhabitants. At the 2021 census, Huși had a population of 25,045.

<text>Turnu Măgurele () is a city in Teleorman County, Romania, in the historical region of Muntenia. Developed nearby the site once occupied by the medieval port of Turnu, it is situated north-east of the confluence between the Olt River and the Danube, at the edge of the Wallachian Plain.

The first documentary attestation of the town appears in a diploma issued by Sigismund of Luxembourg, king of Hungary, on the occasion of the battles fought here in 1394. The fortress belonged to the Ottoman Empire, intermittently, between 1417 and 1829, being a Turkish raya. During the Iancu Jianu&#x27;s hajduk raids against the Vidin pasha Osman Pazvantoglu, the fortress was burned and destroyed. After the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-1829, the town became part of Wallachia, as a result of the Treaty of Adrianople. After 1829, the locality was relocated on a nearby hill, near the localities of Odaia and Măgurele, and the fortress was demolished. Turnu Măgurele was the residence of Teleorman County from 1839 to 1950, and once again from 1952 until 1968, when, following Romania&#x27;s administrative reorganization of that year, it lost the status of county residence in favor of the city of Alexandria.

The communist urban systematization had a major impact on the town&#x27;s urban planning and the establishment of the Chemical Fertilizer Plant (1962) transformed the city into an industrial one. Forced urbanization caused the city&#x27;s population to grow substantially to reach almost 37,000 in 1992.

After the 1989 Revolution, the municipality suffered a sharp decline as a result of the collapse of industrial and economic activities and the migration of the population to the larger cities as well as to other European states.

==Geography==
A ferry plies across the Danube to the Bulgarian city of Nikopol. There are some vestiges of a Roman bridge across the Danube, built in 330 by Constantine the Great. It is built in the Danube plain in a fertile land called Burnas plain. At south-west from it the river Olt joins the Danube. Its medium altitude is above sea level.

==History==
After the Daco-Roman wars of 101–106 AD, ended by the victory of the Roman armies led by Emperor Trajan and the conquest of Dacia. Emperor Trajan fortified the eastern border of Dacia on the Olt line, building the famous Limes Alutanus, consisting of fortresses and fortresses on either side of the Olt River, from the Danube to the Boița Mountains. Procopius of Caesarea, during the time of Justinian the Great, recalls the city of Turris and points to Trajan as its founder. Some historians identify the fortress with the one discovered at Turnu Măgurele. This assertion is not confirmed; according to archaeological research, the Turnu fortress dates from a later period. Historians and archaeologists have not yet agreed on when the construction of the Danube fortification began: there are theories about a construction from the time of Constantine the Great or even later, from the time of Justinian I, but none of them is fully accepted by historians. What is certain is that during the reign of Mircea the Elder, this settlement played an important role in the defensive strategy of Wallachia in the face of the Ottoman danger.

The first documentary attestation of the fortress of Turnu appears between the years 1393-1394 in a document (from 1397) of the chancellery of Sigismund of Luxembourg. The document describes the context and history of Sigsmund&#x27;s struggles in support of Mircea the Elder, his vassal, to return to the throne of Wallachia. In this diploma it is mentioned the recapture of the fortress by the troops allied to Mircea:

The fortress will remain under the rule of Wallachia during the reign of Mircea until around 1417, when Turnu came under Turkish rule and was transformed, together with a security zone (established in the depths of Wallachian territory with a radius of 15 km from the fortress), into Turnu raya. The Ottomans ruled Turnu (Kule in Turkish, Holavnik in Bulgarian) with some intermittencies (between 1462, 1594–1600, and 1772–1774), during the anti-Ottoman rebellions of Vlad III the Impaler and Michael the Brave, until 1826, when it was ceded to Wallachia through the 1826 Akkerman Convention, along with Giurgiu and Brăila. In 1829, following the Treaty of Adrianople the Turnu, Giurgiu, and Brăila rayas were definitively ceded to Wallachia. The fortress was severely damaged and burned by Iancu Jianu&#x27;s &quot;hajduks&quot; in their campaign (1809) against Osman Pazvantoğlu and was never rebuilt under Turkish rule. After the town finally became part of the Wallachia it was moved to the nearby hill and renamed Turnu Măgurele (&quot;măgurele&quot; meaning hillock in Romanian). By a decree issued by Alexandru Dimitrie Ghica, the Prince of Wallachia the town was refounded on 27th February 1836.

Towards the end of World War II, the city served as an unlikely submarine base, as Romania&#x27;s two modern submarines, &quot;Rechinul&quot; and &quot;Marsuinul&quot;, took refuge in the city&#x27;s port following the Soviet aerial bombardment of Constanța on 20 August 1944.

The village of Islaz, near Turnu Măgurele, was the initial center of the 1848 Wallachian revolution (&quot;see Proclamation of Islaz&quot;). During the Romanian War of Independence, the town served as a base for the campaign in Bulgaria. After the administrative reform of 1968, it became a municipality. Starting with the 1960s, new apartment blocks were built in the town, however, in smaller numbers as compared to other towns and cities in the country. The newest neighborhood in the town is the Taberei housing estate, nicknamed among the locals as &quot;Katanga&quot;, because it was built at the same time as the Katanga conflict in Congo.

==Tourist attractions==
The major tourist attraction is Saint Haralambios Cathedral in the center of the town. Built by Greek farmers at the beginning of the 20th century, the cathedral is based on the plans of the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral and constructed in a late renaissance style. Another city landmark is the independence monument, which was built in celebration of the major role that Turnu Măgurele played in the Romanian War of Independence of 1877–1878.

==Economy==
A chemical and textile industry center in the past, the city has more recently been diversifying its economy, with enterprises such as &quot;ElectroTurris&quot; (an electrical engine factory), and &quot;ConservTurris&quot; (a food processing plant).

The chemical plant is notorious for the air pollution it generates (issued gases contain ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, at times above current norms), and it quite possibly does not meet the EU ecological (air pollution) requirements.
