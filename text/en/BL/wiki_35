<text>Grantown-on-Spey () is a town in the Highland Council Area, historically within the county of Moray. It is located on a low plateau at Freuchie beside the river Spey at the northern edge of the Cairngorm mountains, about south-east of Inverness ( by road). 

The town was founded in 1765 as a planned settlement, and was originally called simply Grantown after Sir James Grant. The addition &#x27;on Spey&#x27; was added by the burgh council in 1898. The town has several listed 18th and 19th century buildings, including several large hotels, and serves as a regional centre for tourism and services in the Strathspey region. 

The town is twinned with Notre-Dame-de-Monts in the Vend√©e, Pays de la Loire, France.

==History==

The burgh was founded in 1765 during the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, to encourage both agricultural marketing and handicrafts, as well as to increase local land values and reduce unemployment and emigration. This was part of a wider effort at social and economic improvements brought about by some progressive landlords following the decades of peace after the Jacobite rising of 1745. 

Under the direction and funds of the landowner Sir James Grant, the site chosen for the town was to be a mile from Castle Grant and designed with space for a marketplace (known as the Square), with the High Street leading southwestwards. Large plots of land, 200 yards long, were set at right angles to the road. Old Grantown, an earlier small village near the castle, was demolished; and Kylintra Burn, a local stream, was diverted to become the local water source. The new town was advertised in newspapers and elsewhere as a site conveniently close to farms, forests and quarries, with persons and businesses invited to apply for feus and leases.

The official opening ceremony for the new town took place on 12 June 1766, with a procession and celebration party. By 1768 the town was considered established, and the first buildings had been constructed. By 1787 it was reported that there were over 300 inhabitants. To assist manufacturing, Grant paid for the construction of several small factories, linen manufacturing houses, and a bleachfield. During this period, new side roads, bridges, a town-house and jail were also built.

By 1800, the town had grown enough to satisfy the demand for a new church, and in 1803 Inverallan Church was built (originally named Grantown Church), itself replacing several previous churches, including one said to have dated back to medieval times. The church was rebuilt in the 1880s. By 1841 th town had a population of 1,000. By the 1860s, linen manufacture had declined and Grantown was primarily functioning as a market town for the surrounding agricultural district; then during the late Victorian era tourism began to develop. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert stayed for a night at the Grant Arms on 4 September 1860, as recorded in her diary - an extract from which is on display in the Grant Arms Hotel. In 1863, it was reported that Grantown had 21 merchants, two banks, three inns (the Grant Arms, the Black Bull and the New Inn) and several shops, along with the newly opened Strathspey Railway. In 1898 the town was granted Burgh status, and &#x27;on Spey&#x27; was added to the name by the Burgh council.

In 1900, the High Street consisted of numerous commercial shops, including a ironmonger, stationer, newsagent, photographer, art studio, and several clothes shops, selling tartan, tweeds and knitwear. By 1902, tourism to the town and region had grown significantly, and the same factor was responsible for much of its development and growth in the 20th century and into the 21st. 

The town war memorial to the First World War was erected in 1921, and takes the form of a granite column, designed by Alexander Marshall Mackenzie; the names of casualties from the Second World War were added in 1945. 

By 1965, the town had a population of just under 1,600, and could accommodate 800 visitors in tourist accommodation. 

In 2015 the town celebrated its 250th anniversary, with celebrations and a picnic involving foods reminiscent of those typically eaten in the 18th century.

In 2016, a charity fundraising event was held to honour the linen manufacturing history of the town.

==Economy==
The primary industries in the area are agriculture, forestry, and tourist-related services, including guided wildlife watching tours operated from local hotels, notably the Grant Arms. Birdwatching, red squirrels and some other mammals, and sea life on the nearby coast are among the notable outdoor attractions, as well as the landscapes and geological &amp; glacial history of the nearby Cairngorms and Moray coast.

Further afield, there are several whisky distilleries, including the new Cairn Distillery, by Gordon &amp; MacPhail, in the south-west of the town at Craggan. Millers&#x27; of Speyside is a large abattoir on the edge of the town. There is a large smokehouse, currently operated by the Meatsnacks Group - prior to 2016 it was operated by Young&#x27;s Seafood. The Cairngorms National Park Authority main office is located in the town.

===Accommodation===
There are various hotels and B&amp;Bs, and self-catering accommodation. A large caravan park is managed by the Caravan and Motorhome Club.

===Museum and other notable buildings===
Grantown Museum is located in Burnfield Avenue, near one of the town&#x27;s car parks. In 1861, the Grantown Female School (Burnfield House) was built with funds from Captain John Grant, a factor of Strathspey. The school closed in 1890 when its pupils transferred to Grantown Grammar School and Burnfield House is now the home of the Museum. Adjacent to the museum is a Bell tower that holds the old town bell.

The Speyside Orphanage (also known as the Speyside Charity/Free School) was established in 1795, with funds from Lady Grant of Monymusk. It was originally built by local builder John Russell, but was damaged by fire and rebuilt in 1824, it closed in 1975. The building was converted to a heritage centre, and then later to private flats in 1986. The building is Category A listed and has a small clock tower, with an electric public turret clock from 1975. (The earlier clock is in the town museum).

The High Street and Square contain several notable examples of Scottish baronial architecture and Georgian and Victorian-era buildings. At the corner of 1 High Street and 1 The Square is a Category B listed former bank, built by Matthews and Laurie. It was purpose-built in 1867, and originally housed the Caledonian Bank, then later the Bank of Scotland - which was the last remaining bank in Grantown, before finally closing in March 2021. A turreted building t nos. 3 &amp; 5 High Street formerly contained the Town Post Office and the premises of A.C. Grant, formerly supplier of tweeds to HM King George V.

At 57 High Street is the Ben Mhor hotel, dating to the 1880s, formerly the Temperance Hotel. The former Strathspey Hotel (also called Dunbar&#x27;s Hotel) is an early 19th century Category B listed building at 70/72 High Street, now converted into homes. Hastilow&#x27;s Palace Hotel is another former hotel with multiple dormer windows (built in 1894 on the site of the previous Black Bull Inn) on the High Street, and is now a care home. The Grant Arms Hotel is a listed hotel on the Square which in its current form was primarily built in 1875, with substantial additions in the 1880s. The earlier hotel building was built in 1765, and on 4 September 1860 hosted Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Garth Hotel, on the Square, dates back to 1769, when it was built for James Grant, clerk and factor to Sir James Grant, as a private residence, and was later converted to a hotel. Craiglynne Hotel is a late 19th century hotel on the western edge of the town, on Woodlands Terrace.

The Royal British Legion building on the Square is an Art Deco building that was formerly a cinema from the 1920s to the early 1960s, before becoming a hall for the legion.

===Community Facilities===
Ian Charles Community Hospital is an NHS Scotland community hospital.

Anagach Woods is located on the eastern edge of the town, and has numerous waymarked trails. It is home to a secretive capercaillie population (a species of bird which has suffered drastic declines in numbers in recent decades and is extremely susceptible to human disturbance, meaning that local guides may nowadays decline to direct enthusiasts to try to find them, either in this area or the wider region.

===Churches===

There are a number of churches in the town - none of which has a burial ground.

Inverallan Parish Church (Church of Scotland) is located on Mossie Road. The current Inverallan Church was rebuilt on the site of several earlier churches to a design by the architect Alexander Smith Cullen in 1886. The rebuilding was funded by Caroline Stuart, Countess of Seafield as a memorial to the death of her husband and son. The church is in Victorian Gothic in style and set out in a cruciform shape. The church incorporates details from the previous churches on the site, including carvings and woodwork from the 17th century. 

The Baptist church is at the junction of High Street and Chapel Road. A church in the High Street (opposite Dunstaffnage Brae) is shared by two congregations: Scottish Episcopalian (St Columba), and Roman Catholic (St Anne), who advertise the location as Woodlands Crescent. (Postcode PH26 3EN).
===Cemeteries===
There are two local cemeteries, both of which are maintained by the Highland Council:
*Inverallan, the original burial ground, is now only available for use by holders of existing vacant lairs. Most older inscriptions have been transcribed and published in book form; memorials with no events after 1855 are mostly unrecorded in published form. It is between the River Spey and Inverallan House at O.S. grid reference NJ 026 260, and is beside the car park at the end of a road leading from the B9102 road. Apart from the baptism font beside the entrance gate the original Inverallan parish church no longer remains. Official records for this burial ground were not started until the 1900s, when the gravedigger retired and it was realised that he was then the only source of information regarding burials not indicated on the memorials; the current burial register was founded upon the information supplied by him. Therefore, only burials recorded since that time have details supplied contemporaneously by relatives or undertakers.
*Grantown Cemetery (also known as the New Cemetery) has been in use since the early 20th century. It is located between the B9102 and the A95 roads south of Grantown at O.S. grid reference NJ 027 267. The main entrance and car parking is on the B9102 with an alternative access to the lower end from the A95 Grantown bypass.

==Transport==
===Road===

The town was built on an easily accessible site along the existing military road from Boat of Garten to Inverness and Fort George (built between 1728 and 1730). These are now respectively the A95, the B9102 (the High Street and Square), and the A939 to the north.

The Old Spey Bridge lies on the south-eastern edge of Grantown, at the locality of Speybridge. It dates from 1754, and was built as part of the military road from Grantown eastwards to Corgaff by the 33rd Regiment of Foot under Lord Charles Hay. The bridge has three arches. It was damaged by large floods in 1829, leading to the smallest arch being rebuilt. By 1931, the old bridge was considered insufficient, and a modern concrete bridge replaced it, upstream to the west. (The current A95 crossing). The new bridge was built by engineers Blyth &amp; Blyth, and consists of a single segmental concrete arch of 240¬†ft. The old bridge is now used only by pedestrians and cyclists.

===Rail===
There are now no rail services to Grantown. The closest main line stations are Aviemore and Carrbridge, from which trains travel north and south between Inverness and the Central Belt on the Highland Main Line. There is also a station at Forres, 22 miles to the north, from which trains run between Inverness and Aberdeen.

Grantown-on-Spey was connected by rail until the 1960s. The Inverness and Perth Junction Railway was completed in 1863, and increased the number of tourists and visitors to town. There were two stations, Grantown-on-Spey East and Grantown-on-Spey West. Grantown West station was rebuilt in 1887 to improve facilities for passengers. By October 1965, both stations were closed to passengers, and in 1968 freight services ended.

The Strathspey Railway is a heritage railway which currently runs between Aviemore and Broomhill (near Nethy Bridge), via Boat of Garten. The railway has been progressively reopening the line, and work is ongoing to extend the railway again to Grantown. This included the placement of a new bridge over the River Dulnain.

===Buses===
There are several local bus services, mainly concentrating on the route to and from Aviemore, but also serving surrounding places. Some services operate only on schooldays.

Occasional buses go to the Cairngorm Mountain Railway - especially in the winter, for skiers.

Various long distance bus services are available in Aviemore, Elgin and Keith. Current information for bus services of most of the operators is on the websites of Moray Council and the Stagecoach group.

==Education==

The first school in Grantown was planned from 1765 (on a middle lot to the south side of the Square), with two classrooms, but was not built until 1767 owing to insufficient children of school age in the town. The school was extended in 1879, and continued to expand, the senior years eventually becoming the current Grantown Grammar School - which in 1975 moved to a new large campus building at its present location. It provides education for children and young people between the ages of 11 and 18 years. Grantown Primary School remains on the site of the earlier school, in a newer building constructed following the 1872 Education Act.
 The Speyside Charity/Free School and the Grantown Female School were former schools of the town; their extant buildings have been repurposed.

==Sport==
Grantown-on-Spey golf course was created in 1890, with nine holes, on a partly woodland site, by golfer A.C. Brown. In 1911 it was extended to 18 holes, to a design by Open champion Willie Park Jr., and later altered by James Braid, US Open Champion. A prominent club member was Bobby Cruickshank, who won more than 20 tournaments in the US. The pavilion was built in the 1890s and refurnished in 1999.

The Craig MacLean Leisure Centre is a public leisure centre in the town, with a swimming pool and gym.

<text>Kinghorn (; ) is a town and parish in Fife, Scotland. A seaside resort with two beaches, Kinghorn Beach and Pettycur Bay, plus a fishing port, it stands on the north shore of the Firth of Forth, opposite Edinburgh.

Known as the place where King Alexander III of Scotland died, it lies on the A921 road and the Fife Coastal Path. Kinghorn railway station is on the Edinburgh to Aberdeen and Fife Circle railway lines. Kinghorn only has a primary school, so high school pupils must travel by bus to Balwearie High School in Kirkcaldy. Burntisland was in the past referred to as Little Kinghorn or Wester Kinghorn.

Kinghorn Lifeboat Station is one of Scotland&#x27;s busiest ‚Äì regularly getting called out to all sorts of emergencies in the Firth. Currently stationed at Kinghorn is an Atlantic 85 inshore lifeboat, B-836 &quot;Tommy Niven&quot;.

The civil parish has a population of 4,201 (in 2011). According to the 2008 population estimate, the town has a population of 2,930.

==History==
The meaning of the name Kinghorn (or Kingorn , with stress on the latter syllable, as it was pronounced locally until at least the early 20th century) comes .

The historic Royal Burgh of Kinghorn lies on the coast of Fife. The former royal castle at Kinghorn was frequently visited by the Scottish Court in the period of the House of Dunkeld. The King&#x27;s castle, controlling the seaway, stood on the headland above Pettycur. King Alexander III was returning on horseback to Kinghorn Castle to see his new wife Yolande of Dreux, when he fell and was found dead on the beach of Pettycur Bay in March 1286, creating the succession crisis that led to the Wars of Scottish Independence.

A later structure, Glamis Tower (or Glamis Castle), stood just behind the High Street. When Sir John Lyon married Princess Johanna in 1373, the daughter of King Robert II, her dowry included Glamis Castle. Rebuilt in 1543, the castle was besieged by James Kirkcaldy of Grange in 1546 and fell. Both buildings have totally disappeared and the sites built over in modern times.

During the Scottish Reformation, French troops commanded by Henri Cleutin and Captain Sarlabous sailed from Leith and fought with the Lords of the Congregation at Pettycur Bay on 7 January 1560. Kinghorn Castle remained an important possession of the Scottish Crown, and this was recognised by the creation of the Earldom of Kinghorne in 1606.

In October 1589 the minister of Kinghorn parish, John Scrimgeour, was chosen by King James VI to accompany him on his voyage to meet his bride, Anne of Denmark, in Norway.

A burn, fed from the freshwater Kinghorn Loch above the town, once provided the town with its water and subsequently provided the source of power to drive the machinery of flax mills.

The old town was dramatically transformed in 1846 by the construction of the railway viaduct across the valley of the burn and the opening of Kinghorn Station by the Edinburgh and Northern Railway which had its terminus at Burntisland for ferries across the Forth to Granton. Much of the former horse ferry traffic from Pettycur Bay was lost to Burntisland. The huge viaduct (mainly solid) splits the original town in two and totally dominates the lower (southern) section.

Following the opening of the Forth Railway Bridge in 1890, the North British Railway started to promote Kinghorn&#x27;s picturesque sheltered bay and beach as a resort, which led to considerable development of the town.

==Buildings of Note==

*Kinghorn Town Hall by Thomas Hamilton 1830.
*Kinghorn Parish Church (1774) with a dramatic tower added in 1895 by Sydney Mitchell
*Kinghorn War memorial (1923) designed by William Williamson of Kirkcaldy and sculpted by Alexander Carrick

The town contains a number of 18th-century houses in the Scots vernacular style, but the integrity of the streetscapes are seriously compromised by the &quot;town planning&quot; of the 1960s and 70s, which failed to respect the original character and form.

*Alexander Hannay McIlwraith, served 1908‚Äì1926
*John Heriot Ballingall, served the Free Church 1845 to 1879

==Education==
Kinghorn Primary School is the only school in Kinghorn. The school is housed in a building that was built in 1986. The school has currently achieved three of the four &quot;green flags&quot; available under the Eco-Schools scheme, with the third flag being achieved on 27 May 2009. The school has a long history. The original Parish School building of 1823 designed by Thomas Hamilton is now a library and community centre that retains the original octagonal Museum vestibule with replicas of the Elgin Marbles.

==Culture and sport==
An annual attraction is the Black Rock &#x27;5&#x27; Race, commonly referred to as the &quot;Black Rock &#x27;5&#x27;&quot; or the &quot;Black Rock Race&quot;, a road and beach running race of about that has been held in Kinghorn each year since 1987. Its distinguishing feature is the loop around the Black Rocks, over a mile from the shore, and largely under water except at low tide. The race is held on a suitable Friday in May or June, when the tide is out and the water is no more than knee deep. Over the years it has changed from a simple race into a full-blown social night in Kinghorn&#x27;s calendar.

The inaugural Black Rock &#x27;5&#x27;, held in 1987, was won by Gifford Kerr, ahead of 66 other finishers; a very small field by today&#x27;s standards - in 2005 there were over 600 participants, of a wide variety of abilities. The race has been staged every year since 1987, apart from 1991, and throughout the years the numbers have increased significantly, as did the quality of the top end of the field, with recent winners including Neil Renault and Ross Houston.

In the 21st century the race has been dominated by Edinburgh running club Hunters Bog Trotters (HBT) with both Phil Mowbray and Don Naylor having taken the spoils. The course record belongs to Ian Harkness, also of HBT, in a time of 22:03.

<text>Kinross (, ) is a burgh in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, around south of Perth and around northwest of Edinburgh. It is the traditional county town of the historic county of Kinross-shire.

==History==

Kinross&#x27;s origins are connected with the nearby Loch Leven and its islands whose history goes back to the 5th century AD. Kinross developed as a staging post on the Great North Road from North Queensferry to Perth. In time, local industry developed and by the early 18th century the town had grown to a population of around 600 people. By the mid-19th century, a thriving wool weaving industry had emerged. Kinross Town Hall was completed in 1841.

==Location and transport==
The site of the original Pre-Reformation parish church and churchyard is down a small wynd overlooking Loch Leven, a little away from the town. The church was dedicated to St. Serf and was under control of Dunfermline Abbey. Noteworthy ministers included John Colden from 1593 to 1640 and his son George Colden who served until 1665. The notorious Henry Christie was minister of Kinross 1679‚Äì89.

Rev Robert McGill served from 1698 until 1726, and recorded supernatural events in the manse in 1718. Rev Robert Stark was initially unpopular but served from 1732 to 1783.
Kinross was originally linked by railway to Perthshire, Fife and Clackmannanshire until the rail links gradually disappeared. At one time three independent railway companies had their termini at the town. The Fife and Kinross Railway came from the east, the Kinross-shire Railway came from the south and the Devon Valley Railway came from the west. Kinross Junction railway station stood on the main line between Perth and Edinburgh, but this was closed in 1970 to make way for construction of the M90 motorway. Since then, many people working within a commuting radius of Kinross have settled in the town owing to its central location and local amenities. Locals and Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) have also asked the Scottish Government to publish a Feasibility Study into re-establishing the Perth‚ÄìEdinburgh Direct Rail Link. , no such document has been published.

Kinross is served by local and long-distance bus services including Megabus services M90, M91 and M92 which call at the Sainsbury&#x27;s Park &amp; Ride site off Junction 6 of the M90 motorway.

==Tourism==
The burgh is located on the shores of Loch Leven. There are boat trips around the loch and to Lochleven Castle, where Mary, Queen of Scots was held prisoner in 1567.

Up to 2014 the annual T in the Park music festival, which was officially replaced by TRNSMT festival in Glasgow Green, was held nearby, at the former RAF Balado Bridge airfield. This was also the location of a now decommissioned NATO ICBM early warning radar, and until the late 1950s was a training base for the Royal Air Force.

==Climate==
Kinross has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;).

==Sport and recreation==
The Loch Leven Trails offer 21¬†km (13 miles) of walking and cycling heritage trails around the shoreline of Loch Leven. It runs from RSPB Vane Farm Nature Reserve via Findatie to Kinross Pier/Kirkgate Park.

There is a leisure centre located in Kinross, called Loch Leven Leisure.

Kinross Trout Fishery, situated just on the edge of the village, is one of Scotland&#x27;s premier trout fisheries, giving fly and bait anglers the opportunity to catch some of Scotland&#x27;s largest trout.

Kinross Colts FC is a community football club and registered charity with over 400 boys, girls, men and women playing in 16 teams within the club. They have two grounds locally, The Myre at Smith Street in Kinross and Donaldson Park in Milnathort.

Kinross is also home to Kinross Rugby Club, who play their games at King George V ground alongside Kinross Hockey Club. Locally the ground is known as KGV.

<text>Kirriemuir ( , ; ), sometimes called Kirrie or the &quot;Wee Red Toon&quot;, is a burgh in Angus, Scotland, United Kingdom. 

The playwright J. M. Barrie was born and buried here and a statue of Peter Pan is in the town square.

==History==
Some of the Kirriemuir Sculptured Stones, a series of late Pictish cross slabs, are on display at the Meffan Institute in Forfar, and the others can be seen in the Kirriemuir Gateway to the Glens Museum which now occupies the Kirriemuir Town House.

The lands of Ummarchie lay in the feudal barony of Kirriemure ‚Äì then in the Sheriffdom of Forfar ‚Äì and were owned for centuries by the Lauder of the Bass family. Alexander Lauder of Ummarchie, Co. Forfar, born about 1504 and a younger brother of Robert Lauder of the Bass, appears in many documents and died at some time in 1580. In October of this year, his younger son Walter had murdered his father&#x27;s Roman Catholic brother James in a religious dispute. Walter was found guilty at Edinburgh on 15 December and beheaded. The eldest son, another Alexander Lauder of Ummarchie, stood surety on 22 March 1600 in an Act of Caution in the Privy Council in a principal for 2000 merks for William Rynd of Kers, who was involved in violent armed feuds between the Lindsays and the Ogilvies. Alexander Lauder of Ummarchie was still living in 1608.

Kirriemuir has a history of witchcraft accusations dating back to the 16th century. A pond on the outskirts, known as the Witch Pool, was a millpond for the 19th-century Meikle Mill. Local amateur historians tend to think this referred to a &quot;mickle&quot; (small) mill, but the reference is to one of James or his son Andrew Meikle&#x27;s mills, based on ideas picked up in the Netherlands in the 1700s. The Meikles were a family of agricultural engineers from Haddington who were held in high esteem for many generations in . The adjacent &quot;Court Hillock&quot; was shown, during excavations for a housing development, to be no more than a spoil heap left after excavation and cleaning of the pond.

Though Kirrimuir&#x27;s importance as a market town has diminished, its former jute factories (now manufacturing synthetics) recall its 19th-century importance as a centre of a home-based weaving industry.

Historic features near Kirriemuir include a carved Pictish stone known as the Eassie Stone. It was found in a burn near the village of Eassie.

Kirriemuir claims the narrowest public footpath in Western Europe; Cat&#x27;s Close, situated between Grant&#x27;s Pend and Kirkwynd. It is a mere wide.

The family estate of Sir Hugh Munro, who created &quot;Munro&#x27;s Tables&quot; of Scottish mountains over in elevation (which are now called &quot;munros&quot;), is also located near the town.

Kirriemuir Gingerbread was created by the baker, Walter Burnett, around 1900, though the recipe was sold to what is now Bell&#x27;s Food Group, located in Shotts, in the 1940s.

==Governance==
Kirriemuir is represented within Angus Council by the Kirriemuir and Dean ward, from which three councillors are elected. As of 2019 these were: Julie Bell (Scottish National Party), George Meechan (Scottish National Party) and Ronnie Proctor (Scottish Conservative and Unionist). Kirriemuir Town Hall, which was the meeting place of the former burgh council, was completed in 1885.

==Culture==
The town has three museums: the Gateway to the Glens Museum, Barrie&#x27;s Birthplace, and the Tayside Police Museum. There was once a museum of aviation, whose artifacts are now in the Richard Moss Memorial Collection at the Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre. There is a camera obscura, donated by J. M. Barrie, on the hill, offering views to the south and south-west and of the higher hills to the north. Also on the hill and offering views from its southern slopes is the town cemetery, where Barrie is buried in the family grave. There is a silver granite war memorial in the centre of the cemetery, a column surmounted by a kilted soldier looking down across the town and over the broad fields of Strathmore to the Sidlaws.

Every August a local music team holds a music festival, Live in the Den, featuring local guitar bands. In 2011 it was not held due to flooding.

==Setting==
Kirriemuir consists mainly of two areas: Northmuir and Southmuir. It sits looking south towards Glamis and the Sidlaws over Strathmore (one of the most fertile fruit-growing areas in Scotland). Its position at the base of the Angus glens makes it an attractive centre for hill walking on nearby Munros, and for fishing, partridge, pheasant and grouse shooting, and deer-stalking. There is also an 18-hole golf course with views north to Glen Clova and Glen Doll.

==Schools==
Webster&#x27;s High School is located in Southmuir; Northmuir and Southmuir each have a primary school. Northmuir&#x27;s replaced Reform Street Primary School, which was in the town centre and demolished to build the Lyell Court Sheltered Housing complex. Southmuir&#x27;s moved to new premises in 2002, which had been built as part of an extension to Webster&#x27;s High School. The earlier Southmuir building (once the original Webster&#x27;s Seminary) was destroyed by fire on 29 October 2006 and has since been demolished.

==Parks==
The town&#x27;s two main parks lie in the Gairie Burn glen and on top of Kirriemuir Hill.

The Den can be split into two parts. The east Den lies to the east of Bellies Brae (The Commonty) and the west Den to the west of Bellies Brae. This park has a climbing frame and swing set. The Den is prone to flooding, as it lies in a deep valley. This last happened in October 2023. In the far west Den, there is a large Den Waterfall and the Cuttle Well.

The Hill with Neverland, or the Peter Pan Play Park as it is sometimes called, is located in Northmuir. This play park with a Peter Pan theme was laid out in November 2010. Smaller parks include Davidson Park in Southmuir and Martin Park off Slade Road.

==Sport==
Kirriemuir is home to the junior football club Kirriemuir Thistle. Although Kirriemuir lacks a senior team side, the nearest club in the Scottish Football League is Forfar Athletic in the neighbouring town, one of several Angus clubs to play in the official league system. Kirriemuir also has a wheeled sports area in Martin Park and an all-weather sports pitch at Webster&#x27;s Leisure Centre adjoining Webster&#x27;s High School.

In the 1880s, Lindertis F.C. from Kirriemuir played in the Scottish Cup for five seasons, and Kirriemuir F.C. for one.

==Notable people==
*John Ogilby (also Ogelby, Oglivie) was born in Kirriemuir in November 1600; publisher, translator, impresario and the pioneering cartographer who produced the first road map of England in 1675. 
*J. M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan and Rector of the University of St Andrews, was born in Kirriemuir. He called this &quot;wee red toonie&quot; &quot;Thrums&quot; in his novels &quot;Auld Licht Idylls&quot;, &quot;A Window in Thrums&quot;, and &quot;The Little Minister&quot;. &quot;Red&quot; refers to a reddish sandstone used on older buildings in the town, which became a minor tourism destination in response to Barrie. His birthplace on the Brechin road is now a museum owned by the National Trust for Scotland. A statue of Peter Pan stands in the square.
*Violet Jacob, poet and novelist, returned widowed from India in 1936, went to live in Kirriemuir, and died there in 1946. 
*Jean Cameron, a 1940s postwoman in Glen Clova, pressed successfully for the official dress-code to allow trousers for women delivering mail (commemorated in Kirriemuir). 
*Scott McKenna, professional footballer playing for Nottingham Forest and Scotland, grew up in Kirriemuir and attended Websters High School.
*David Niven, actor, claimed Kirriemuir as his birthplace, but was actually born in London.
*Bon Scott, vocalist of AC/DC, was born at the maternity hospital in nearby Forfar in 1946 and lived in Kirriemuir until 1952, when his family emigrated to Australia. A plaque to his memory stands in Cumberland Close. On 26 January 2016, town officials approved plans for a statue of Scott in the Bellies Brae car park. This was unveiled by former AC/DC bass player Mark Evans in April 2016 during the town&#x27;s annual &quot;Bonfest&quot; event.
*Sir David Wilkie, surgeon, was born here in 1882. He befriended Barrie in 1930, when he became Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, due to their common home town.
*Victoria Cross awardees: Captain Charles Lyell, Corporal Richard Burton, and Private Charles Melvin resided in Kirriemuir.
*Ryan Kopel, actor and singer.

<doc id="399957" wikidata="Q92993" url="?curid=399957" title="Jeff Hawkins">
<text>Jeffrey Hawkins is an American businessman, computer scientist, neuroscientist and engineer. He co-founded Palm Computing ‚Äî where he co-created the PalmPilot and Treo ‚Äî and Handspring.

He subsequently turned to work on neuroscience, founding in 2002 the Redwood Neuroscience Institute. In 2005 he co-founded Numenta, where he leads a team in efforts to reverse-engineer the neocortex and enable machine intelligence technology based on brain theory.

He is the co-author of &quot;On Intelligence&quot; (2004), which explains his memory-prediction framework theory of the brain, and the author of &quot;A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence&quot; (2021).

==Education==
Hawkins attended Cornell University, where he received a Bachelor of Science with a major in electrical engineering in 1979.

His interest in pattern recognition for speech and text input to computers led him to enroll in the biophysics program at the University of California, Berkeley in 1986. While there he patented a &quot;pattern classifier&quot; for handwritten text, but his PhD proposal on developing a theory of the neocortex was rejected.

==Career==
Hawkins joined GRiD Systems in 1982, where he developed rapid application development (RAD) software called &quot;GRiDtask&quot;. As vice president of research from 1988 to 1992, he developed their pen-based computing initiative that in 1989 spawned the GridPad, one of the first tablet computers.

Hawkins founded Palm Inc., in January 1992. In 1998 he left the company along with Palm co-founders Donna Dubinsky and Ed Colligan to start Handspring.

In March 2005, Hawkins, together with Dubinsky (Palm&#x27;s original CEO) and Dileep George, founded Numenta, Inc.

== Neuroscience ==
In 2002, after two decades of finding little interest from neuroscience institutions that he did not have a stake in, Hawkins founded the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park, California. 

In 2004, he co-authored &quot;On Intelligence&quot; with Sandra Blakeslee, laying out a theory on his &quot;memory-prediction framework&quot; of how the brain works.

One of Hawkins&#x27; areas of interest is cortical columns. In 2016, he hypothesized that cortical columns did not capture just a sensation, but also the relative location of that sensation, in three dimensions rather than two (situated capture), in relation to what was around it. Hawkins explains, &quot;When the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else&quot;.

In 2021, he published &quot;A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence&quot;, a framework for intelligence and cortical computation. The book details the advances he and the Numenta team made in the development of their theory of how the brain understands the world and what it means to be intelligent. It also details how the &quot;thousand brains&quot; theory can affect machine intelligence, and how an understanding of the brain impacts the threats and opportunities facing humanity. It also offers a theory of what&#x27;s missing in current AI.

==Board and institute memberships==
In 2003, Hawkins was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering &quot;for the creation of the hand-held computing paradigm and the creation of the first commercially successful example of a hand-held computing device.&quot; He also served on the Advisory Board of the Secular Coalition for America where he has advised on the acceptance and inclusion of nontheism in American life.

<text>The Bonus Army was a group of 43,000 demonstrators ‚Äì 17,000 veterans of U.S. involvement in World War I, their families, and affiliated groups ‚Äì who gathered in Washington, D.C., in mid-1932 to demand early cash redemption of their service bonus certificates. Organizers called the demonstrators the Bonus Expeditionary Force (B.E.F.), to echo the name of World War I&#x27;s American Expeditionary Forces, while the media referred to them as the &quot;Bonus Army&quot; or &quot;Bonus Marchers&quot;. The demonstrators were led by Walter W. Waters, a former sergeant.

Many of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression. The World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1945. Each certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier&#x27;s promised payment with compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates.

On July 28, 1932, U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance, shot at the protestors, and two veterans were wounded and later died. President Herbert Hoover then ordered the U.S. Army to clear the marchers&#x27; campsite. Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur commanded a contingent of infantry and cavalry, supported by six tanks. The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out, and their shelters and belongings burned.

A second, smaller Bonus March in 1933 at the start of the Roosevelt administration was defused in May with an offer of jobs with the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) at Fort Hunt, Virginia, which most of the group accepted. Those who chose not to work for the CCC by the May 22 deadline were given transportation home. In 1936, Congress overrode President Roosevelt&#x27;s veto and paid the veterans their bonus nine years early.

==Origin of military bonuses==
The practice of war-time military bonuses began in 1776, as payment for the difference between what a soldier earned and what he could have earned had he not enlisted. The practice derived from English legislation passed in the 1592‚Äì93 session of Parliament to provide medical care and maintenance for disabled veterans and bonuses for serving soldiers.

In August 1776, Congress adopted the first national pension law providing half pay for life for disabled veterans. Considerable pressure was applied to expand benefits to match the British system for serving soldiers and sailors but had little support from the colonial government until mass desertions at Valley Forge that threatened the existence of the Continental Army led George Washington to become a strong advocate.

In 1781, most of the Continental Army was demobilized. Two years later, hundreds of Pennsylvania war veterans marched on Philadelphia, then the nation&#x27;s capital, surrounded the State House, where the U.S. Congress was in session, and demanded back pay. Congress fled to Princeton, New Jersey, and several weeks later, the U.S. Army expelled the war veterans from Philadelphia. Congress progressively passed legislation from 1788 covering pensions and bonuses, eventually extending eligibility to widows in 1836.

Before World War I, the soldiers&#x27; military service bonus (adjusted for rank) was land and money; a Continental Army private received and $80.00 (2017: $1,968.51) at war&#x27;s end, while a major general received . In 1855, Congress increased the land-grant minimum to , and reduced the eligibility requirements to fourteen days of military service or one battle; moreover, the bonus also applied to veterans of any Indian war. The provision of land eventually became a major political issue, particularly in Tennessee where almost 40% of arable land had been given to veterans as part of their bonus. By 1860, had been issued and lack of available arable land led to the program&#x27;s abandonment and replacement with a cash-only system. Breaking with tradition, the veterans of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War did not receive a bonus and after World War I, that became a political matter when they received only a $60 bonus ($ in 2025). The American Legion, created in 1919, led a political movement for an additional bonus.
On May 15, 1924, President Calvin Coolidge vetoed a bill granting bonuses to veterans of World War I, saying: &quot;patriotism... bought and paid for is not patriotism.&quot; However, the Bonus Bill was endorsed by Henry Cabot Lodge and Charles Curtis. Congress overrode Coolidge&#x27;s veto of the Bonus Bill, enacting the World War Adjusted Compensation Act. Each veteran was to receive a dollar for each day of domestic service, up to a maximum of $500 (), and $1.25 for each day of overseas service, up to a maximum of $625 ($ in 2025). Deducted from this was $60, for the $60 they received upon discharge. Amounts of $50 or less were immediately paid. All other amounts were issued as Certificates of Service maturing in 20 years.

There were 3,662,374 Adjusted Service Certificates issued, with a combined face value of $3.64 billion (equivalent to $¬†billion in ). Congress established a trust fund to receive 20 annual payments of $112 million that, with interest, would finance the 1945 disbursement of the $3.638 billion for the veterans. Meanwhile, veterans could borrow up to 22.5% of the certificate&#x27;s face value from the fund; but in 1931, because of the Great Depression, Congress increased the maximum value of such loans to 50% of the certificate&#x27;s face value. Although there was congressional support for the immediate redemption of the military service certificates, Hoover and Republican congressmen opposed such action and reasoned that the government would have to increase taxes to cover the costs of the payout and so any potential economic recovery would be slowed.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars continued to press the federal government to allow the early redemption of military service certificates.

In January 1932, a march of 25,000 unemployed Pennsylvanians, dubbed &quot;Cox&#x27;s Army&quot;, had marched on Washington, D.C., the largest demonstration to date in the nation&#x27;s capital, setting a precedent for future marches by the unemployed.

==Campsite==

Most of the Bonus Army (Bonus Expeditionary Force or BEF) camped in a form of a &quot;Hooverville&quot; on the Anacostia Flats (now Section C of Anacostia Park), a swampy, muddy area away from the federal core of Washington. Other veterans lived much closer, in partially demolished buildings on Pennsylvania Avenue near the Third Street SW. Although occupation of Anacostia Flats was against federal law, D.C. police Superintendent 
Pelham D. Glassford obtained permission off the record from his friend Major General Ulysses S. Grant III, Director of Public Buildings and Public Parks in the Capital, who promised to make no objection. The chosen site was located in the historically African American side of Anacostia; nearby were tennis courts and a baseball diamond, the latter of which was used by children of the camp. The War Department had refused a request by Senator James Hamilton Lewis to set up billets, so veterans, women and children lived in the shelters they built from materials dragged out of a junk pile nearby, which included old lumber, packing boxes, and scrap tin covered with roofs of thatched straw. The shack city was nicknamed Camp Marks, after the friendly Police Captain S.J. Marks.

Camp Marks was tightly controlled by the veterans, who laid out streets, built sanitation facilities, set up an internal police force and held daily parades. A vibrant community arose revolving around several key sections, including the religious tent, where marchers could be heard expressing forbearance, trust in God and gratitude for what they had compared to other victims of the Depression. Also popular was the Salvation Army lending library, where marchers wrote letters home in its makeshift post office (postage stamps were more prized than cigarettes, it was said). To live in the camps, veterans were required to register and to prove they had been honorably discharged or provided a bonus certificate, at which point a membership card would be issued. The Superintendent of the D.C. Police, Pelham D. Glassford, worked with camp leaders to supply the camp with food and supplies.

On June 15, 1932, the US House of Representatives passed the Wright Patman Bonus Bill (by a vote of 211‚Äì176) to move forward the date for World War I veterans to receive their cash bonus. Over 6,000 bonus marchers massed at the U.S. Capitol on June 17 as the U.S. Senate voted on the Bonus Bill. The bill was defeated by a vote of 62‚Äì18.

== Police shooting ==

On July 28, under prodding from President Herbert Hoover, the D.C. Commissioners ordered Pelham D. Glassford to clear their buildings, rather than letting the protesters drift away as he had previously recommended. When the veterans rioted, an officer (George Shinault) drew his revolver and shot at the veterans, two of whom, William Hushka and Eric Carlson, died later.
* William Hushka (1895‚Äì1932) was an immigrant to the United States from Lithuania. When the US entered World War I in 1917, he sold his butcher shop in St. Louis, and joined the army. After the war, he lived in Chicago. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery a week after being shot and killed by police.
* Eric Carlson (1894‚Äì1932) was a veteran from Oakland, California, who fought in the trenches of France in World War I. He was interred in Arlington National Cemetery.

During a previous riot, the Commissioners asked the White House for federal troops. Hoover passed the request to Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley, who told MacArthur to take action to disperse the protesters. Towards the late afternoon, cavalry, infantry, tanks and machine guns pushed the &quot;Bonusers&quot; out of Washington.

===Reports on communist elements===
An Army intelligence report claimed that the BEF intended to occupy the Capitol permanently and instigate fighting, as a signal for communist uprisings in all major cities. It also conjectured that at least part of the Marine Corps garrison in Washington would side with the revolutionaries, hence Marine units eight blocks from the Capitol were never called upon. The report of July 5, 1932, by Conrad H. Lanza in upstate New York was not declassified until 1991.

The Department of Justice released an investigative report on the Bonus Army in September 1932, noting that communists had attempted to involve themselves with the Bonus Army from the start, and had been arrested for various offenses during protests:
As soon as the bonus march was initiated, and as early as May, 1932, the Communist party undertook an organized campaign to foment the movement, and induced radicals to join the marchers to Washington. As early as the edition of May 31, 1932, the Daily Worker, a publication which is the central organ of the Communist party in the United States, urged worker veteran delegations to go to Washington on June 8th.

In 1932, Hoover stated that the bulk of Bonus Army members behaved reasonably and a minority of what he described as communists and career criminals were responsible for most of the unrest associated with the events: &quot;I wish to state emphatically that the extraordinary proportion of criminal, Communist, and nonveteran elements amongst the marchers as shown by this report, should not be taken to reflect upon the many thousands of honest, law-abiding men who came to Washington with full right of presentation of their views to the Congress. This better element and their leaders acted at all times to restrain crime and violence, but after the adjournment of Congress a large portion of them returned to their homes and gradually these better elements lost control.&quot; In his 1952 memoir, Hoover stated that at least 900 of the Bonus Army were &quot;ex-convicts and Communists.&quot;

In his memoir &quot;The Whole of Their Lives&quot; (1948) Benjamin Gitlow of the Communist Party USA reported that a number of communists had joined the Bonus Army during their trek across the nation, with the goal of recruiting people to the communist cause.

A 2009 &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; blog post asserted these would-be communist organizers were largely rejected by the Bonus Army marchers: &quot;[T]here were communists present in the camps, led by John T. Pace from Michigan. But if Pace believed that Bonus Army was a ready-made revolutionary cadre, he was mistaken. The marchers routinely expelled avowed communists from the camps. They destroyed communist leaflets and other literature. And among their other slogans the veterans adopted a motto directed at the communists, &#x27;Eyes front‚Äînot left!&#x27;&quot;

==Army intervention==
At 1:40 pm, General Douglas MacArthur ordered General Perry L. Miles to assemble troops on the Ellipse immediately south of the White House. Within the hour the 3rd Cavalry led by George S. Patton, then a Major, crossed the Memorial Bridge, with the 12th Infantry arriving by steamer about an hour later. At 4 pm, Miles told MacArthur that the troops were ready, and MacArthur (like Eisenhower, by now in service uniform) said that Hoover wanted him to &quot;be on hand as things progressed, so that he could issue necessary instructions on the ground&quot; and &quot;take the rap if there should be any unfavorable or critical repercussions.&quot;

At 4:45¬†pm, commanded by MacArthur, the 12th Infantry Regiment, Fort Howard, Maryland, and the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, supported by five M1917 light tanks commanded by Patton, formed in Pennsylvania Avenue while thousands of civil service employees left work to line the street and watch. The Bonus Marchers, believing the troops were marching in their honor, cheered the troops until Patton ordered the cavalry to charge them.

After the cavalry charged, the infantry, with fixed bayonets and tear gas (adamsite, an arsenical vomiting agent) entered the camps, evicting veterans, families, and camp followers. No shots were fired. The veterans fled across the Anacostia River to their largest camp, and Hoover ordered the assault stopped. MacArthur chose to ignore the president and ordered a new attack, claiming that the Bonus March was an attempt to overthrow the US government. 55 veterans were injured and 135 arrested. A veteran&#x27;s wife miscarried. When 12-week-old Bernard Meyer died in the hospital after being caught in the tear gas attack, a government investigation reported he died of enteritis, and a hospital spokesman said the tear gas &quot;didn&#x27;t do it any good.&quot;

During the military operation, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower, served as one of MacArthur&#x27;s junior aides. Believing it wrong for the Army&#x27;s highest-ranking officer to lead an action against fellow American war veterans, he strongly advised MacArthur against taking any public role: &quot;I told that dumb son-of-a-bitch not to go down there,&quot; he said later. &quot;I told him it was no place for the Chief of Staff.&quot; Despite his misgivings, Eisenhower wrote the Army&#x27;s official incident report that endorsed MacArthur&#x27;s conduct.

Although the troops were ready, Hoover twice sent instructions to MacArthur not to cross the Anacostia bridge that night, both of which were received. Shortly after 9 pm, MacArthur ordered Miles to cross the bridge and evict the Bonus Army from its encampment in Anacostia. This refusal to follow orders was claimed by MacArthur&#x27;s assistant chief of staff George Van Horn Moseley. However, MacArthur&#x27;s aide Dwight Eisenhower, Assistant Secretary of War for Air F. Trubee Davison, and Brigadier General Perry Miles, who commanded the ground forces, all disputed Moseley&#x27;s claim. They said the two orders were never delivered to MacArthur and they blamed Moseley for refusing to deliver the orders to MacArthur for unknown reasons. The shacks in the Anacostia Camp were then set on fire, although who set them on fire is somewhat unclear.

==Aftermath==
Joe Angelo, a decorated hero from the war who had saved Patton&#x27;s life during the Meuse-Argonne offensive on September 26, 1918, approached him the day after to sway him. Patton, however, dismissed him quickly. This episode was said to represent the proverbial essence of the Bonus Army, each man the face of each side: Angelo the dejected loyal soldier; Patton the unmoved government official unconcerned with past loyalties.

Though the Bonus Army incident did not derail the careers of the military officers involved, it proved politically disastrous for Hoover, and it was a contributing factor to his losing the 1932 election in a landslide to Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Police Superintendent Glassford was not pleased with the decision to have the Army intervene, believing that the police could have handled the situation. He soon resigned as superintendent.

MGM released the movie &quot;Gabriel Over the White House&quot; in March 1933, the month Roosevelt was sworn in as president. Produced by William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s Cosmopolitan Pictures, it depicted a fictitious President Hammond who, in the film&#x27;s opening scenes, refuses to deploy the military against a march of the unemployed and instead creates an &quot;Army of Construction&quot; to work on public works projects until the economy recovers. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt judged the movie&#x27;s treatment of veterans superior to Hoover&#x27;s.

During the presidential campaign of 1932, Roosevelt had opposed the veterans&#x27; bonus demands. He became President in March, 1933, and soon a second bonus march was planned for May by the &quot;National Liaison Committee of Washington.&quot; It demanded that the Federal government provide marchers housing and food during their stay in the capital. Despite his opposition to the marchers&#x27; demand for immediate payment of the bonus, Roosevelt greeted them quite differently than Hoover had done. The Roosevelt administration set up a special camp for the marchers at Fort Hunt, Virginia, providing forty field kitchens serving three meals a day, bus transportation to and from the capital, and entertainment in the form of military bands.

Administration officials, led by presidential confidant Louis Howe, tried to negotiate an end to the protest. Roosevelt arranged for his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, to visit the site unaccompanied. She lunched with the veterans and listened to them perform songs. She reminisced about her memories of seeing troops off to World War I and welcoming them home. The most that she could offer was a promise of positions in the newly created Civilian Conservation Corps. One veteran commented, &quot;Hoover sent the army, Roosevelt sent his wife.&quot; In a press conference following her visit, the First Lady described her reception as courteous and praised the marchers, highlighting how comfortable she felt despite critics of the marchers who described them as communists and criminals.

On May 11, 1933, Roosevelt issued an executive order allowing the enrollment of 25,000 veterans in the CCC, exempting them from the normal requirement that applicants be unmarried and under the age of 25. Congress, with Democrats holding majorities in both houses, passed the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act in 1936, authorizing the immediate payment of the $2 billion in World War I bonuses, and then overrode Roosevelt&#x27;s veto of the measure. The House vote was 324 to 61, and the Senate vote was 76 to 19.

==In literature==
The shootings are depicted in Barbara Kingsolver&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lacuna&quot;.

The Bonus Marchers are detailed in John Ross&#x27;s novel &quot;Unintended Consequences (novel).&quot;

A fictionalized version of the Bonus March is depicted in the opening scenes of the 1995 movie &quot;In Pursuit of Honor.&quot;

The main character of Neal Stephenson&#x27;s 2024 novel, &quot;Polostan (novel)&quot; travels with a group of communists within the bonus army to Washington, and is embroiled in the army&#x27;s intervention.

<text>Belinda Kimberly &quot;Lindy&quot; Layton (born 7 December 1970) is an English singer. She was a founding member of and vocalist for dance music band Beats International. She has released a number of solo albums and singles and worked with other musicians, more recently including Hardknox and Dub Pistols.

==Career==
Layton attended the Barbara Speake Stage School in the 1980s and appeared as an actor in TV shows such as &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;Press Gang&quot; (though many people have mistaken the latter for an appearance in &quot;Grange Hill&quot; on BBC One, getting Layton mixed up with the actress Lindy Brill, who had also played a character called Cathy (Hargreaves)).
In the early 1990s, Layton was part of Norman Cook&#x27;s dance music collective Beats International, which featured her as lead vocalist on a couple of singles, including the number-one hit &quot;Dub Be Good to Me&quot;. Beats International&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Let Them Eat Bingo&quot;, sold moderately.

Following the success of the singles with Beats International in 1990, Layton signed a solo deal with Arista, and released her version of Janet Kay&#x27;s hit &quot;Silly Games&quot;. The single was a hit, and further releases followed from her 1991 debut album &quot;Pressure&quot;. However, these decreased in popularity. &quot;Pressure&quot; was mostly produced by Norman Cook and the dance-soul-funk outfit Driza Bone. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Echo My Heart&quot;, narrowly missed a UK Top 40 placing in January 1991, while &quot;Wait for Love&quot; produced by Norman Cook failed to reach the UK Top 75 Singles Chart altogether, in April of that year.

Layton&#x27;s summer 1991 release of &quot;Without You (One and One)&quot; followed, again produced by Driza Bone. &quot;Without You (One and One)&quot; sold better than Layton&#x27;s previous single, but failed to reach the Top 40. Layton released a one-off single for Debut Records in 1992. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be a Freak for You&quot; was not a UK Top 75 chart hit. The following year, Layton re-emerged with a new deal with PWL. The new material was more commercial, and two single releases of minor chart success were released in the UK: &quot;We Got the Love&quot; and &quot;Show Me&quot;. Without the expected profitable return, Layton parted company with PWL.

In Japan she released a pop-reggae album, &quot;No Other Star&quot;, in 1996, and went on to release other work as Hardknox with fellow DJ Steve Proctor the same year. They were signed to Skint Records and released their debut single &quot;Coz I Can&quot; which was given &quot;Single of the Week&quot; honours by &quot;NME&quot;. The group&#x27;s second effort, the &quot;Psychopath&quot; EP, received the same recognition. After various performing remixes for artists such as Orgy, Crystal Method, and Faith No More, plus appearing on a various compilations and mixes, a self-titled LP was released in 1999 by Jive Electro.

Layton guested on three tracks on the 2009 Groove Diggerz album &quot;Money for Good Times&quot;: &quot;Weirdness&quot;, &quot;Just Be Good to Me&quot; (a reworking of her Beats International hit &quot;Dub Be Good to Me&quot;), and &quot;Body Flow&quot;, for which she also shared a writing credit.

She guested with the Dub Pistols in May 2009, reprising &quot;Dub Be Good to Me&quot;, at their support slot to the Specials at the O2 Academy Brixton. She guested again with the Dub Pistols at Rock the River 2009, a wakeboard and music festival held on the quay of World Heritage Site, Conwy. She also appeared with the Dub Pistols at the last Glade Festival in 2009. Layton has also recorded with the band, appearing alongside Rodney P on the single &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot; from their 2009 album &quot;Rum &amp; Coke&quot; and &quot;Rock Steady&quot; from the 2013 LP &quot;Worshipping the Dollar&quot;. In 2013, she began a daytime radio show on Kane FM with Mel Foster, &quot;The Mrs&quot;, which ran for about a year. She is now a songwriter and composes with her writing partner Matt Kootchi, who owns and runs house label Good Lucky Recordings.

<doc id="399970" wikidata="Q736785" url="?curid=399970" title="Morpeth, Northumberland">
<text>Morpeth is a historic market town in Northumberland, England, lying on the River Wansbeck. Nearby towns include Ashington and Bedlington. In the 2011 census, the population of Morpeth was given as 14,017, up from 13,833 in the 2001 census. The earliest evidence of settlement is believed to be from the Neolithic period, and some Roman artifacts have also been found. 

The first written mention of the town is from 1080, when the de Merlay family was granted the barony of Morpeth. The meaning of the town&#x27;s name is uncertain, but it may refer to its position on the road to Scotland and a murder which occurred on that road. The de Merlay family built two castles in the town in the late 11th century and the 13th century. The town was granted its coat of arms in 1552. By the mid-1700s it had become one of the main markets in England, having been granted a market charter in 1200, but the opening of the railways in the 1800s led the market to decline. The town&#x27;s history is celebrated in the annual Northumbrian Gathering.

Morpeth is governed by Northumberland County Council and Morpeth Town Council. The town is split into three wards ‚Äì North, Kirkhill and Stobhill ‚Äì for the purposes of parish elections. In 2008 the town suffered a severe flood, which was repeated in 2012, resulting in the construction of new flood defences. Morpeth railway station is on the east coast line and a curve to the south of it has caused several rail crashes. Several sports teams compete in Morpeth, with Morpeth Town A.F.C. having been the winner of the FA Vase in 2016. The town hosted its own Olympics from 1873 to 1958. Two middle schools, a high school and seven first schools are situated in Morpeth, as well as several churches of Anglican, Roman Catholic, United Reformed and Methodist denominations. Morpeth&#x27;s Carlisle Park, the recipient of several awards, contains one of the four floral clocks in England.

== History ==
Morpeth was founded at a crossing point of the River Wansbeck. Remains from prehistory are scarce, but the earliest evidence of occupation found is a stone axe thought to be from the Neolithic period. There is a lack of evidence of activity during the Roman occupation of Britain, although there were probably settlements in the area at that time. The first written reference is from 1080 when William de Merlay was rewarded for his part in suppressing a rebellion in Northumbria with &quot;the Barony of Morthpeth stretching from the Tyne to the Coquet&quot;. The name derives from Old English &quot;mor√∞ p√¶√∞&quot; and literally means &quot;murder path&quot;; writing in 1666, the antiquarian John Stainsby attributed this moniker to &quot;the many robberies and murders in those parts committed&quot;.

The barony of Morpeth was granted to the de Merlay family in around 1080, and by 1095 a motte-and-bailey castle had been built by William de Merlay. It is uncertain whether there was any settlement at Morpeth at the time that the barony was created, and documents relating to the foundation of an abbey in 1137 refer to the &quot;new town of Morpeth&quot;. Newminster Abbey, located on the outskirts of Morpeth, was founded in 1138 by William&#x27;s son, Ranulf de Merlay, lord of Morpeth, and his wife, Juliana, daughter of Gospatric II, Earl of Lothian, as one of the first daughter houses of Fountains Abbey. King John granted a market charter for the town to Roger de Merlay in 1200. It became one of the main markets in Northern England by the mid-1700s and by the mid 18th century was one of the key cattle markets in England selling cattle driven by drovers over the border from Scotland; however, the opening of the railways made transport to Newcastle easier in the 19th century, and the market accordingly declined. The market is still held on Wednesdays.
The town was badly damaged by fire set by the barons in 1215 during the First Barons&#x27; War, in an attempt to block the military operations of King John. Whilst it is common report that the motte-and-bailey castle was burnt down by King John in 1216 and a new Morpeth Castle was built later in the 13th century by Ranulph de Merlay, to the south of Haw Hill, there is no firm evidence that King John destroyed the castle and an alternative narrative suggests that the second castle was in fact &quot;completed by William de Merlay (the 2nd) in the year of his death&quot; (). In the 13th century, a stone bridge was built over the Wansbeck in Morpeth, to the west of the current bridge, replacing the ford previously in use in Morpeth. For some months in 1515‚Äì16, Margaret Tudor (Henry VIII&#x27;s sister) who was the Queen Consort of Scotland (James IV&#x27;s widow), had laid ill in Morpeth Castle, having been brought there from Harbottle Castle. The only remains of the castle are the inner gatehouse, which was restored by the Landmark Trust, and parts of the ruined castle walls.

In 1540, Morpeth was described by the royal antiquary John Leland as &quot;long and metely well-builded, with low houses&quot; and &quot;a far fairer town than Alnwick&quot;. During the 1543‚Äì51 war of the Rough Wooing, Morpeth was occupied by a garrison of Italian mercenaries, who &quot;pestered such a little street standing in the highway&quot; by killing deer and withholding payment for food. In 1552, William Hervey, Norroy King of Arms, granted the borough of Morpeth a coat of arms. The arms were the same as those granted to Roger de Merlay, but with the addition of a gold tower. In the letters patent, Hervey noted that he had included the arms of the &quot;noble and valyaunt knyght ... for a p&#x27;petuall memory of his good will and benevolence towardes the said towne&quot;.

Morpeth was a borough by prescription, but received its first charter of confirmation from Charles II. The corporation it created was controlled by seven companies: the Merchant Tailors, the Tanners, the Fullers and Dyers, the Smiths, the Cordwainers, the Weavers and the Butchers. This remained the governing charter until the borough was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. During the Second World War, RAF Morpeth, an air-gunnery training school, opened at nearby Tranwell.

The town and the county&#x27;s history and culture are celebrated at the annual Northumbrian Gathering. The gathering is held over a weekend in mid-April and includes the Border Cavalcade and Pageant. The 50th gathering took place in 2017.

== Governance ==
Morpeth has two tiers of local government.

The lower tier is Morpeth Town Council, which has 15 members. Morpeth is a civil parish with the status of a town. For the purposes of parish elections the town is divided into three wards: North, Kirkhill and Stobhill, each returning five town councillors. Each ward also elects one County Councillor. In May 2021, the political make up of the Town Council was ten Conservatives, two Liberal Democrats, two Green and one Labour member.

The upper tier of local government is Northumberland County Council, which meets at County Hall in Morpeth. Since April 2009 the county council has been a unitary authority. Previous to this there was an intermediate tier, the non-metropolitan district of Castle Morpeth, which has been abolished along with all other districts in the county. The county council has 67 councillors, of whom three represent Morpeth, one each from the electoral wards of Morpeth Kirkhill, Morpeth North and Morpeth Stobhill. The 2017 and 2021 County Council elections both elected three Conservative councillors for the three wards.

== Climate ==
Cockle Park, located slightly north of Morpeth, contains a Met Office weather station, founded in 1897.

On 6 September 2008, Morpeth suffered a severe flood, causing damage to 1,000 properties and leading 400 residents to be evacuated. The town&#x27;s flood defences were breached after 12 hours, when a month&#x27;s worth of rain fell on Morpeth.

In September 2012, flooding occurred again, causing damage to properties, although floodwaters were reportedly shallower than in 2008.

===Flood defences===
Work on flood defences started in 2013 in response to the 2008 floods. New flood defences were built in the town centre and a dam with a storage reservoir was built on the Mitford Estate. A second ¬£27m dam was completed in May 2017 to reduce flooding from the Cotting Burn and marked the completion of the Morpeth flood defence plan.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===

The A1, the longest numbered road in the UK, used to pass through Morpeth until the bypass was opened in 1970. Other roads that pass though the town are: A192, A196, A197, B1337, B6343 and the B6524.

Morpeth Northern Bypass

The Morpeth Northern Bypass was a project to decrease traffic congestion in Morpeth town centre and decrease journey times from Pegswood, Ashington and Newbiggin to the A1 and beyond. The Bypass follows on from the Pegswood Bypass at Whorral Bank Roundabout and continues to the St George&#x27;s Roundabout and then onto Northgate Roundabout and St Leonard&#x27;s A1 Junction. The Project was completed in 2017, which has allowed increased connectivity to SE Northumberland and beyond.

=== Rail ===

Morpeth&#x27;s railway station is on the main East Coast Main Line which runs between London and Edinburgh. To the south of the station is a sharp curve which has been the scene of several train crashes. A non-passenger line operates between Morpeth and Bedlington. A former line, closed in 1966, ran west from Morpeth to Scots Gap (from where there was a branch line to Rothbury), then west to Redesmouth, and lastly south to Hexham.

=== Bus ===
Arriva North East are the main operator of bus services in the town, with services going to nearby towns and villages such as Pegswood, Guide Post, Ashington, Bedlington or to Newcastle, Alnwick, Amble, Berwick or Widdrington.

== Education ==

The local state school, King Edward VI School, was originally founded as a chantry school in the early 14th century and was located in the Morpeth Chantry. The school was refounded in 1552 by royal charter as the Free Grammar School of King Edward the Sixth, being commonly referred to as the Morpeth Grammar School by locals. The school was renamed to King Edward VI Grammar School by 1947 and in the 1970s lost its grammar school status, becoming a comprehensive under the current name.

The town has two middle schools, Newminster and Chantry, which are built next door to one another. It also has several first schools: Abbeyfields First School in Kirkhill, Morpeth First School in Loansdean to the south of the town, Stobhillgate First School in the Stobhillgate housing estate, and Morpeth All Saints&#x27; Church of England-aided First School in Lancaster Park, which is located north of the town. Additionally, St. Robert&#x27;s R.C. First School, a primary school for Roman Catholics, is located in Oldgate, Morpeth.

== Religious sites ==


===Church of England===
The ancient Church of England parish church of Morpeth is St Mary&#x27;s at High Church, which was the main Anglican place of worship in the area until the 1840s. The church is mostly in the 14th century style. The grave of Emily Wilding Davison lies in St Mary&#x27;s graveyard.

In 1843, a public meeting was called to address the lack of attendance at the church, and it was found that the walk to the current church, then on the southern edge of the town, was too much for many of the parishioners. From this meeting, it was decided to build a new church in the town centre and accordingly, the church of St James the Great was consecrated for worship on 15 October 1846. Benjamin Ferrey designed the church in a &quot;Neo-Norman&quot; style, based on the 12th century Monreale Cathedral, Sicily.

A third parish church, St Aidan&#x27;s, was founded as a mission church in 1957, located on the Stobhill estate on the south-east of the town.

===Roman Catholic Church===
Morpeth&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, St Robert of Newminster Church, was built off Oldgate on land adjacent to Admiral Lord Collingwood&#x27;s house. It was consecrated on 1 August 1850 by the Right Reverend William Hogarth, Bishop of Samosata (later Bishop of Hexham). Collingwood House is now the presbytery (residence) for the priest in charge of the Church.

===United Reformed Church===
Morpeth has had a Presbyterian ministry since 1693. Their first service was held in a tannery loft in the town in February 1693 and in 1721 a chapel was built in Cottingwood Lane, which still exists as a private home. The construction of St. George&#x27;s United Reformed Church began in 1858 and the first service in the new building was held on 12 April 1860. The Church stands immediately to the north of the Telford Bridge and is in the style of the early English era, containing a stained glass rose window and an octagonal spirelet.

===Methodist Church===
The present Methodist Church in Howard Terrace was opened as a Primitive Methodist place of worship on 24 April 1905. Designed by J. Walton Taylor, it was built from local quarry stone. Although the Primitive Methodists were united with the Wesleyan Church to form the Methodist Church of Great Britain in 1932, a separate Wesleyan Church continued to function in Manchester Street until 1964, when the congregations were united at Howard Terrace. The former Wesleyan Church (built in 1883) is currently used as the Explorer Scout headquarters.

== Sport ==
Morpeth Town A.F.C., Morpeth RFC and the Morpeth Golf Club play competitively within Morpeth. In addition, the Morpeth Harriers compete in athletics. The town also offers opportunities to play sport on a non-competitive basis through facilities such as Carlisle Park, the common for playing golf and football, and the Riverside leisure centre for swimming, indoor sports and fitness gym activities. Morpeth Town A.F.C. was the 2016 winner of the FA Vase.

The Morpeth Olympic Games, a professional event consisting mainly of athletics and wrestling, were staged from 1873 until 1958, barring interruptions during the two world wars. The Games were held on the Old Brewery Field until 1896, then at Grange House Field until the First World War. After two years at the town&#x27;s cricket pitch at Stobhill (1919‚Äì20), the Olympics moved to Mount Haggs Field until 1939, and then back to Grange House Field after the war until the end of the games in 1958.

In 1730, a racecourse was built for horse racing, which was used until 1854, when the racetrack was replaced with St. George&#x27;s Hospital.

The town was the start point of the Morpeth To Newcastle Road Race. This road running race was held annually on New Year&#x27;s Day from 1902 to 2004, when insurance and policing costs became prohibitively high, and winners included Commonwealth champion Jack Holden and Olympic medallist Mike McLeod.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the Pontop Pike and local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Newcastle on 95.4 FM, Capital North East on 105.3 FM, Heart North East on 101.8 FM, Smooth North East on 97.5 FM, Hits Radio North East on 97.1 FM, and Koast Radio, a community based radio station which broadcast on 106.6 FM.

The Morpeth Herald is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

== Landmarks ==

The historical layout of central Morpeth consisted of Bridge Street, Oldgate Street and Newgate Street, with burgage plots leading off them. Traces of this layout remain: Old Bakehouse Yard off Newgate Street is a former burgage plot, as is Pretoria Avenue, off Oldgate. The town stands directly on what used to be the Great North Road, the old coaching route between London and Edinburgh.

Carlisle Park is located on the southern bank of the River Wansbeck in Morpeth. The park has the William Turner Garden, one of the only four floral clocks in England, a statue of Emily Wilding Davison, as well as other facilities and attractions. Morpeth&#x27;s Mafeking Park, at the bottom of Station Bank, was unsuccessfully put forward by locals to be listed as the smallest park in the world in the Guinness Book of Records.

<text>Charles Frederick Newcombe (15 September 1851 ‚Äì 19 October 1924) was a British botanist and ethnographic researcher. He is known for his studies of the First Nations or native people of Canada. 

==Biography==
Newcombe was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, as the eighth of fourteen children. His parents were William Lister Newcombe (1817‚Äì1908) and Eliza Jane (Rymer) (1816‚Äì1888), who were both from Yorkshire.

Newcombe received his MB from the University of Aberdeen in 1873 and his MD in 1878. He married Marian Arnold (1857‚Äì1891) in 1879. For a number of years he was in general practice in the Lake District.
In 1884, Newcombe emigrated to the United States, establishing a general practice in Hood River, Oregon. He moved in 1885 with his family to Victoria, British Columbia. In 1889, he moved back to Victoria and worked at the &quot;Insane Asylum&quot; in New Westminster. His wife Marian died after the birth of their sixth child in 1891, leaving him with two daughters and four sons.

With his eldest three children, he returned to England and participated in geological and natural history studies at the British Museum and the University of London. He ceased to practice medicine after 1894.

Newcombe began to study the botany of North America and made many trips to Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands) by boat. In the process he became very interested in the Haida and started to collect their artifacts to &quot;preserve&quot; them from, what was then thought to be, the impending demise of the native culture.
Newcombe and others were driven by the &quot;fear that &#x27;pure&#x27; Northwest Coast cultures were disappearing through depopulation and assimilation&quot;.

In 1897, George Amos Dorsey traveled with him in an effort to collect Haida artifacts for the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago. Dorsey, an American, was known for his haste in his collecting. Dorsey asked Scottish guide James Deans to keep quiet about their activities in the area. Local missionary John Henry Keen lambasted Deans and his unidentified American collaborators for disrupting and desecrating the graves of the local natives in their hunt for Northwest Coast artifacts.

Newcombe acquired many totem poles for the Royal British Columbia Museum, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, the British Museum, Kew Gardens, and museums in Cambridge, Liverpool and Sydney. In 1904, he went with six Vancouver Island First Nations people and their medicine man to the World&#x27;s Fair held in St. Louis to show their crafts and culture.

Newcombe also conducted biological and geographic research, such as on local (British Columbia) mollusks and paleontology. In 1913, he led a Commission studying the effect of sea lions on the salmon industry. In 1914, he prepared a report on the circumnavigation of Vancouver Island. Much of his work, including collection of plants, mollusks, fossils, aboriginal artifacts and information, was done with the help of his youngest surviving son, William Henry Arnold Newcombe (1884-1960).

Newcombe died in 1924 in Victoria, British Columbia, after catching a cold (more likely pneumonia) on a sailing expedition.

<doc id="399977" wikidata="Q6860992" url="?curid=399977" title="Milton Bearden">
<text>Milton Bearden is an American author, film consultant, and former CIA officer. Bearden served as the president and CEO of the Asia-Africa Projects Group, a Washington, D.C.‚Äìbased firm that provides resource development and advisory services, from 2010 to 2015. He has been engaged in authorship and film consultancy since 1998. As of 2016, Bearden resides in Austin, Texas, with his wife, Marie-Catherine, a retired university professor, at Georgetown University and the University of Texas at Austin, and currently a professional consultant on inter-cultural protocols and etiquette. 

== Early life and education ==
Bearden was born in Oklahoma and spent his early years in Washington state, where his father worked on the Manhattan Project, and later moved with his family to Houston, Texas. After serving in the United States Air Force, he joined the CIA in 1964. Bearden studied Chinese at the Yale Institute of Far Eastern Languages and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in linguistics from the University of Texas at Austin.

== Career ==

=== CIA ===
During his 30-year career with the CIA, Bearden was a station chief in Pakistan, Nigeria, Sudan and Germany. He served as the CIA&#x27;s chief of station in Pakistan from 1986 to 1989, and played a role in managing Agency&#x27;s provision of arms, intelligence and training to the ISI which in turn provided the Afghan mujahedeen fighting occupying Soviet forces. He was also responsible for collecting intelligence on Pakistan&#x27;s then-covert nuclear weapons program.

Bearden appeared several times in the BBC Documentary by Adam Curtis called &quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; where he talked of his involvement with the Mujahadeen, the Afghan Arabs and how he was assigned to the role by William Casey, the then current Director of Central Intelligence. According to Bearden, Casey told him that Afghanistan seemed to be possibly one of the keys to winning. Casey said &quot;&#x27;I want you to go to Afghanistan, I want you to go next month and I will give you what ever you need to win... He gave me the Stinger missiles and a billion dollars!&quot;

Bearden was one of the senior CIA officials criticized in the 1994 &quot;snitch fax&quot;. The fax was allegedly written by ex-CIA officer David Sullivan, and addressed to members of Congress investigating CIA issues, including the Aldrich Ames spy case.

He was later appointed the Chief of the Soviet/East European Division during the collapse of the Soviet Union. He received the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the Intelligence Medal of Merit and the Donovan Award for his CIA service. He received the Federal Cross of Merit from the President of the German Federal Republic for his service in Germany at the end of the Cold War.

=== Writer and commentator ===

Since retiring, Bearden has written books based on his experiences, commented on current events, and appeared on television, including &quot;Secret Warriors&quot; (Discovery Channel), &quot;Covert Action&quot; (BBC), &quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; (BBC2), and &quot;Heroes Under Fire&quot; (The History Channel). Although generally supportive of the CIA and its mission, he has also been outspoken in his criticism of US actions in the War on Terrorism. He was co-author of one book with James Risen. Bearden is a frequent contributor to the op-ed pages of the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal, and has contributed to Foreign Affairs and to the book about the September 11 attacks, &quot;How Did This Happen?&quot;, published by PublicAffairs. He also serves as a consultant for CBS News.

In August 1999, he argued that the threat posed by Osama bin Laden had been blown out of proportion. He called for the U.S. government to renounce &quot;any plans for a unilateral military action against Osama bin Laden or for another cruise missile attack on Afghanistan.&quot; Bearden also called for a &quot;serious dialogue&quot; with the Taliban and said that they &quot;have no more obligation to extradite Osama bin Laden to the United States than, say, the French do in the case of Ira Einhorn or the Israelis in the case of Samuel Scheinbein‚Äîboth of whom are fugitives from American justice in capital murder cases&quot;.

Following the September 11 attacks, he coined the term &quot;graveyard of empires&quot; to refer to Afghanistan, invoking Afghan victories against outside invaders which had significant political consequences for the invading nations. Bearden predicted that relying on the Northern Alliance against majority ethnic groups would create &quot;a brutal, general civil war that would continue until the United States simply gave up&quot;.

Bearden has provided commentary for several documentaries films and television series, including &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Biography&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear&quot;, &quot;National Geographic: Inside 9/11, Our Own Private Bin Laden, The Eighties, Afghanistan 1979, Spy Wars,&quot; and &quot;Afghanistan: The Wounded Land.&quot;

=== Film consultant ===

He worked with Robert De Niro on &quot;Ronin&quot; and &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, and worked with De Niro and screenwriter Eric Roth (&quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;The Insider&quot;) on &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;, released in December 2006. Universal Studios and De Niro&#x27;s Tribeca Productions have optioned &quot;The Main Enemy&quot; as a planned sequel to &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;. He also worked with director Mike Nichols on the film &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;, released in December 2007.

<text>Boto»ôani () is the capital city of Boto»ôani County, in the northern part of Moldavia, Romania. Today, it is best known as the birthplace of many celebrated Romanians, including Mihai Eminescu, Nicolae Iorga and Grigore Antipa.

==Origin of the name==
The name of the city probably has its origin in the name of a boyar family called &quot;Bota»ô&quot;, whose name can be found in old records from the time of Prince Stephen the Great (late 15th century) as one of the most important families of Moldavia, records which trace it back to the 11th century.

==History==
Boto»ôani is first mentioned in 1439, in which one chronicle says that &quot;the Mongols came and pillaged all the way to Botu»ôani&quot;. The town is then mentioned only during the conflicts between Moldavia and Poland: several battles were fought near the town, in 1500, 1505 and 1509. During the reign of Petru Rare»ô, the town was set ablaze by the Poles. It was during his reign then that we know that the town had a hill fort.

In the 15th century, it was still not a fully-fledged town, but archeological evidence shows that it was a pre-urban settlement. During the second part of the 14th century, some Transylvanian colonists (most likely German or Hungarian) settled in Boto»ôani. Additionally, a large community of Armenian traders settled in the 14th or 15th centuries.

At the junction of several commercial roads including the &quot;Moldavian Road&quot;, which linked Ia»ôi to Hotin, the city was initially a market town. By 1579 it already had &quot;the biggest and the oldest fair of Moldavia&quot;.

A large Jewish community was established in the city during the 17th century, which was the second biggest and most important in Moldavia until the end of the 19th century.

During World War II, Boto»ôani was captured on 7 April 1944 by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front in the course of the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive.

Some of the most famous Romanian cultural representatives such as Mihai Eminescu, Romania&#x27;s national poet, and Nicolae Iorga, the famous Romanian historian, were born in Boto»ôani. Contemporary poet Maria Baciu also hails from Boto»ôani.

It is also the location of A.T. Laurian National College, founded in 1859, one of Romania&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious pre-university educational institutions.

==Demographics==

Historically Jewish people constituted a large part of the population, reaching 15,502 (53%) at its peak in 1942.

As of 2011 census data, Boto»ôani has a population of 106,847, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, making it the 19th largest city in Romania. The estimated population as of July 2018 was 120,535. The ethnic makeup was as follows:
* Romanians: 98.1%
* Roma: 1%
* Lipovans: 0.6%
* Jews: 0.06%
* Other: 0.24%

==Culture==
Boasting a rich cultural life, the city of Boto»ôani has long produced major personalities in science and culture. Boto»ôani natives like Mihai Eminescu, Nicolae Iorga and Octav Onicescu have become major figures in diverse disciplines, and many have distinct claims to relevance not just within Romania, but on a worldwide level.

<text>The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) is a natural history museum on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. Located in Theodore Roosevelt Park, across the street from Central Park, the museum complex comprises 21 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, in addition to a planetarium and a library. The museum collections contain about 32 million specimens of plants, animals, fungi, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts, as well as specialized collections for frozen tissue and genomic and astrophysical data, of which only a small fraction can be displayed at any given time. The museum occupies more than . AMNH has a full-time scientific staff of 225, sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year, and averages about five million visits annually.

The AMNH is a private 501(c)(3) organization. The naturalist Albert S. Bickmore devised the idea for the American Museum of Natural History in 1861, and, after several years of advocacy, the museum opened within Central Park&#x27;s Arsenal on May 22, 1871. The museum&#x27;s first purpose-built structure in Theodore Roosevelt Park was designed by Calvert Vaux and J. Wrey Mould and opened on December 22, 1877. Numerous wings have been added over the years, including the main entrance pavilion (named for Theodore Roosevelt) in 1936 and the Rose Center for Earth and Space in 2000.

==History==
===Founding===

==== Early efforts ====
The naturalist Albert S. Bickmore devised the idea for the American Museum of Natural History in 1861. At the time, he was studying in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at Louis Agassiz&#x27;s Museum of Comparative Zoology. Observing that many European natural history museums were in populous cities, Bickmore wrote in a biography: &quot;Now New York is our city of greatest wealth and therefore probably the best location for the future museum of natural history for our whole land.&quot; For several years, Bickmore lobbied for the establishment of a natural history museum in New York. Upon the end of the American Civil War, Bickmore asked numerous prominent New Yorkers, such as William E. Dodge Jr., to sponsor his museum. Although Dodge himself could not fund the museum at the time, he introduced the naturalist to Theodore Roosevelt Sr., the father of future U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt.

Calls for a natural history museum increased after Barnum&#x27;s American Museum burned down in 1868. Eighteen prominent New Yorkers wrote a letter to the Central Park Commission that December, requesting the creation of a natural history museum in Central Park. Central Park commissioner Andrew Haswell Green indicated his support for the project in January 1869. A board of trustees was created for the museum. The next month, Bickmore and Joseph Hodges Choate drafted a charter for the museum, which the board of trustees approved without any changes. It was in this charter that the &quot;American Museum of Natural History&quot; name was first used. Bickmore said he wanted the museum&#x27;s name to reflect his &quot;expectation that our museum will ultimately become the leading institution of its kind in our country&quot;, similar to the British Museum. Before the museum was established, Bickmore needed to secure approval from Boss Tweed, leader of the powerful and corrupt Tammany Hall political organization. The legislation to establish the American Museum of Natural History had to be signed by John Thompson Hoffman, the governor of New York, who was associated with Tweed.

==== Creation and new building ====
Hoffman signed the legislation creating the museum on April 6, 1869, with John David Wolfe as its first president. Subsequently, the chairman of the AMNH&#x27;s executive committee asked Green if the museum could use the top two stories of Central Park&#x27;s Arsenal, and Green approved the request in January 1870. Insect specimens were placed on the lower level of the Arsenal, while stones, fossils, mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles were placed on the upper level. The museum opened within the Arsenal on May 22, 1871. The AMNH became popular in the following years. The Arsenal location had 856,773 visitors in the first nine months of 1876 alone, more than the British Museum had recorded for all of 1874.

Meanwhile, the AMNH&#x27;s directors had identified Manhattan Square (bounded by Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, 81st Street, Ninth Avenue/Columbus Avenue, and 77th Street) as a site for a permanent structure. Several prominent New Yorkers had raised $500,000 to fund the construction of the new building. The city&#x27;s park commissioners then reserved Manhattan Square as the site of the permanent museum, and another $200,000 was raised for the building fund. Numerous dignitaries and officials, including U.S. president Ulysses S. Grant, attended the museum&#x27;s groundbreaking ceremony on June 3, 1874. 

The museum opened on December 22, 1877, with a ceremony attended by U.S. president Rutherford B. Hayes. The old exhibits were removed from the Arsenal in 1878, and the AMNH was debt-free by the next year.

===19th century===
Originally, the AMNH was accessed by a temporary bridge that crossed a ditch, and it was closed during Sundays. The museum&#x27;s trustees voted in May 1881 to complete the approaches from Central Park, and work began later that year. The landscape changes were nearly complete by mid-1882, and a bridge over Central Park West opened that November. At this point, the AMNH&#x27;s Manhattan Square building and the Arsenal could not physically fit any more objects, and the existing facilities, such as the 100-seat lecture hall, were insufficient to accommodate demand. The trustees began discussing the possibility of opening the museum on Sundays in May 1885, and the state legislature approved a bill permitting Sunday operations the next year. Despite advocacy from the working class, the trustees opposed Sunday operations because it would be expensive to do so. At the time, the museum was open to the general public on Wednesdays through Saturdays, and it was open exclusively to members on Mondays and Tuesdays. The museum&#x27;s collections continued to grow during the 1880s, and it hosted various lectures through the 19th century.

With several departments having been crowded out of the original building, New York state legislators introduced bills to expand the AMNH in early 1887; thousands of teachers endorsed the legislation. City parks engineer Montgomery A. Kellogg was directed to prepare plans for landscaping the site. In March 1888, the trustees approved an entrance pavilion at the center of the 77th Street elevation. The New York City Board of Estimate began soliciting bids from general contractors in late 1889. Many of the objects and specimens in the museum&#x27;s collection could not be displayed until the annex was opened. The original building was refurbished during 1890, and the museum&#x27;s library was transferred to the west wing that year. The AMNH&#x27;s trustees considered opening the museum on Sundays by February 1892 and stopped charging admission that July. The museum began Sunday operations in August, and the southern entrance pavilion opened that November. Even with the new wing, there was still not enough space for the museum&#x27;s collection. The city&#x27;s Park Board approved a new lecture hall in January 1893, but the hall was postponed that May in favor of a wing extending east on 77th Street. A contract to furnish the east wing was awarded in June 1894. 

When the east wing was nearly completed in February 1895, the AMNH&#x27;s trustees asked state legislators for $200,000 to build a wing extending west on 77th Street. The east wing was still being furnished by August; its ground floor opened that December. The museum&#x27;s funds and collections continued to grow during this time. A hall of mammals opened within the museum in November 1896. That year, the AMNH received approval to extend the east wing northward along Central Park West, creating an L-shaped structure. Plans for an expanded east wing were approved in June 1897, and a contract was awarded two months later. The museum&#x27;s director Morris K. Jesup also sponsored worldwide expeditions to obtain objects for the collection. By mid-1898, the west wing, the expanded east wing, and a lecture hall at the center of the museum were underway; however, the project encountered delays due to a lack of city funding. The west and east wings, with several exhibit halls, were nearly complete by late 1899, but the lecture hall had been delayed. A hall dedicated to ancient Mexican art opened that December.

=== 20th century ===

==== 1900s to 1940s ====
The museum&#x27;s 1,350-seat lecture hall opened in October 1900, as did the Native American and Mexican halls in the west wing. During the 1900s, the AMNH sponsored several expeditions to grow its collection, including a trip to Mexico, a trip to collect fauna from the Pacific Northwest, a trip to collect art in China, and an expedition to collect rocks in local caves. One such exhibition yielded a brontosaurus skeleton, which was the centerpiece of the dinosaur hall that opened in February 1905.

In the early 1920s, museum president Henry Fairfield Osborn planned a new entrance for the AMNH, which was to contain a memorial to Theodore Roosevelt. Also around that time, the New York state government formed a commission to study the feasibility of a Roosevelt memorial. After a dispute over whether to put the memorial in Albany or in New York City, the government of New York City offered a site next to the AMNH for consideration. The commission rejected a &quot;conventional Greek mausoleum&quot; design, instead opting to design a triumphal arch and hall in a Roman style. In 1925, the AMNH&#x27;s trustees hosted an architectural design competition, selecting John Russell Pope to design the memorial hall. Construction began in 1929, and the trustees approved final plans the next year. J. Harry McNally was the general contractor. Roosevelt&#x27;s cousin, U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt, dedicated the memorial on January 19, 1936.

==== 1950s to 1990s ====
The original building was later known as &quot;Wing A&quot;. During the 1950s, the top floor was renovated into a library, being redecorated with what Christopher Gray of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;dropped ceilings and the other usual insults&quot;. The ten-story Childs Frick Building, which contained the AMNH&#x27;s fossil collection, was added to the museum in the 1970s. 

The architect Kevin Roche and his firm Roche-Dinkeloo have been responsible for the master planning of the museum since the 1990s. Various renovations to both the interior and exterior have been carried out. Renovations to the Dinosaur Hall were undertaken beginning in 1991, and Roche-Dinkeloo designed the eight-story AMNH Library in 1992. The museum&#x27;s Rose Center for Earth and Space was completed in 2000.

=== 21st century ===

In 2001, the museum&#x27;s lecture hall was renamed the Samuel J. and Ethel LeFrak Theater, after Samuel J. LeFrak donated US$8 million to the AMNH. The museum&#x27;s south facade, spanning 77th Street from Central Park West to Columbus Avenue, was cleaned and repaired, re-emerging in 2009. Steven Reichl, a spokesman for the museum, said that work would include restoring 650 black-cherry window frames and stone repairs. The museum&#x27;s consultant on the latest renovation was Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc., an architectural and engineering firm with headquarters in Northbrook, Illinois. The museum also restored the mural in Roosevelt Memorial Hall in 2010.

====Gilder Center====
In 2014, the museum published plans for a $325 million, annex, the Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation, on the Columbus Avenue side.

On October 11, 2016, the Landmarks Preservation Commission unanimously approved the expansion. Construction of the Gilder Center, which was expected to break ground the next year following design development and Environmental Impact Statement stages, would entail demolition of three museum buildings built between 1874 and 1935. The museum filed plans for the expansion in August 2017, but due to community opposition, construction did not start until June 2019.

On May 4, 2023, the Gilder Center opened, and the museum had 1.5 million visitors over the next three months.

====Native remains====
In late 2023, the museum announced that it would stop displaying human remains from its collection. Despite the 1990 passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), as late as 2023, the AMNH held an estimated 1,900 Native American remains that had not been repatriated.

After the act was revised in January 2024, the AMNH&#x27;s Eastern Woodlands and Great Plains halls were closed because the museum would have needed permission to display all of the artifacts in the halls. The museum agreed to repatriate the remains that July.

== Original structure ==
The original Victorian Gothic building was designed by Calvert Vaux and J. Wrey Mould, both already closely identified with the architecture of Central Park. Vaux and Mould&#x27;s original plan was intended to complement the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the opposite side of Central Park. The original building, as constructed, was at the center of the 77th Street frontage and measured across; it featured a gallery measuring long tall. This gallery contained a raised basement, three stories of exhibits, Venetian Gothic arches, and an attic with dormers and a slate roof. The rear of the gallery included two towers: one containing a stairwell and the other containing curators&#x27; rooms. The original structure still exists but is hidden from view by the many buildings in the complex that today occupy most of Manhattan Square. The museum remains accessible through its 77th Street foyer, which has since been renamed the Grand Gallery.

The full plan called for twelve pavilions similar in design to the original building. Eight pavilions would have been arranged as the sides of a square, while the remaining four would be perpendicular to each other in the interior of the square. There were to be eight towers along the perimeter of the square, as well as a dome in the center, at the intersection of the four interior pavilions. In each pavilion, there was to be a ground floor; the second floor was to contain a gallery; the third floor was to exhibit specimens; and the fourth floor was to be used for research. Upon the intended completion of the master plan, the museum would measure from north to south and from west to east, including projections from the square. The finished structure, with a ground area of over , would have been the largest building in North America, as well as the largest museum building in the world. The master plan was never fully realized; by 2015, the museum consisted of 25 separate buildings that were poorly connected.

The original building was soon eclipsed by the west and east wings of the southern frontage, designed by J. Cleaveland Cady as a brownstone neo-Romanesque structure. It extends along West 77th Street, with corner towers tall. Its pink brownstone and granite, similar to that found at Grindstone Island in the St. Lawrence River, came from quarries at Picton Island, New York. The southern wing contains several halls ranging in size from to . At the ends of either wings are rounded turret-like towers.

== New York State Memorial to Theodore Roosevelt ==
The main entrance hall on Central Park West is formally known as the New York State Memorial to Theodore Roosevelt. Completed by John Russell Pope in 1936, it is an over-scaled Beaux-Arts monument to former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt. The hall was originally supposed to have formed one end of an &quot;Intermuseum Promenade&quot; through Central Park, connecting with the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the east, but the promenade was never completed.

The memorial hall has a pink-granite facade, which is modeled after Roman arches. In front of the hall on Central Park West is a terrace measuring long, as well as a series of steps. The main entrance consists of an arch measuring high. The underside of the arch is a coffered granite vestibule, which leads to a bronze, glass, and marble screen. On either side of the arch are niches that contain sculptures of a bison and a bear. It is flanked by two pairs of columns, which are topped by figures of American explorers John James Audubon, Daniel Boone, Meriwether Lewis, and William Clark. These figures were sculpted by James Earle Fraser and are about high. In the attic above the main archway, there is an inscription describing Roosevelt&#x27;s accomplishments. The words &quot;Truth&quot;, &quot;Knowledge&quot;, and &quot;Vision&quot; are carved into the entablature under this inscription.

Fraser also designed an equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt, flanked by a Native American and an African American, which originally stood outside the memorial hall. In the 21st century, the statue generated controversy due to its subordinate depiction of these figures behind Roosevelt. This prompted AMNH officials to announce in 2020 that they would remove the statue. The statue was removed in January 2022 and will be on a long-term loan to the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in North Dakota.The interior of the Memorial Hall measures across, with a barrel-vaulted ceiling measuring tall. The ceiling contains octagonal coffers, while the floors are made of mosaic marble tiles. The lowest of the walls are wainscoted in marble, above which the walls of the memorial hall are made of limestone. The top of each wall contains a marble band and a Corinthian entablature. Each of the Memorial Hall&#x27;s four sides contains two red-marble columns, each measuring tall and rising from a Botticino marble pedestal. There are rounded windows at clerestory level on the north and south walls. William Andrew MacKay designed three murals depicting important events in Roosevelt&#x27;s life: the construction of the Panama Canal on the north wall, African exploration on the west wall, and the Treaty of Portsmouth on the south wall. The east and west walls, contain four quotes from Roosevelt under the headings &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;Manhood&quot;, &quot;Youth&quot;, and &quot;The State&quot;.

The Memorial Hall originally connected to various classrooms, exhibition rooms, and a 600-person auditorium. Directly underneath the Memorial Hall is an entrance to the 81st Street‚ÄìMuseum of Natural History station. Today, the hall connects to the Akeley Hall of African Mammals and the Hall of Asian Mammals. The Memorial Hall contains four exhibits that describe Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s conservation activities in his youth, early adulthood, U.S. presidency, and post-presidency.

==Mammal halls==

===Old World mammals===

====Akeley Hall of African Mammals====
Named after taxidermist Carl Akeley, the Akeley Hall of African Mammals is a two-story hall on the second floor, directly west of the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall. It connects to the Hall of African Peoples to the west. The Hall of African Mammals&#x27; 28 dioramas depict in meticulous detail the great range of ecosystems found in Africa and the mammals endemic to them. The centerpiece of the hall is a herd of eight African elephants in a characteristic &#x27;alarmed&#x27; formation. Though the mammals are typically the main feature in the dioramas, birds and flora of the regions are occasionally featured as well. The hall in its current form was completed in 1936.

The Hall of African Mammals was first proposed to the museum by Carl Akeley around 1909; he proposed 40 dioramas featuring the rapidly vanishing landscapes and animals of Africa. Daniel Pomeroy, a trustee of the museum and partner at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., offered investors the opportunity to accompany the museum&#x27;s expeditions in Africa in exchange for funding. Akeley began collecting specimens for the hall as early as 1909, famously encountering Theodore Roosevelt in the midst of the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African expedition. On these early expeditions, Akeley was accompanied by his former apprentice in taxidermy, James L. Clark, and artist, William R. Leigh. When Akeley returned to Africa to collect gorillas for the hall&#x27;s first diorama, Clark remained behind and began scouring the country for artists to create the backgrounds. The eventual appearance of the first habitat groups impacted the design of other diorama halls, including Birds of the World, the Hall of North American Mammals, the Vernay Hall of Southeast Asian Mammals, and the Hall of Oceanic Life.

After Akeley&#x27;s unexpected death during the Eastman-Pomeroy expedition in 1926, responsibility of the hall&#x27;s completion fell to James L. Clark, who hired architectural artist James Perry Wilson in 1933 to assist Leigh in the painting of backgrounds. Wilson made many improvements on Leigh&#x27;s techniques, including a range of methods to minimize the distortion caused by the dioramas&#x27; curved walls. In 1936, William Durant Campbell, a wealthy board member with a desire to see Africa, offered to fund several dioramas if allowed to obtain the specimens himself. Clark agreed to this arrangement, resulting in the acquisition of numerous large specimens. Kane joined Leigh, Wilson, and several other artists in completing the hall&#x27;s remaining dioramas. Though construction of the hall was completed in 1936, the dioramas gradually opened between the mid-1920s and early 1940s.
====Hall of Asian Mammals====

The Hall of Asian Mammals, sometimes referred to as the Vernay-Faunthorpe Hall of Asian Mammals, is directly south of the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall. It contains 8 complete dioramas, 4 partial dioramas, and 6 habitat groups of mammals and locations from India, Nepal, Burma, and Malaysia. The hall opened in 1930 and, similar to the Akeley Hall of African Mammals, is centered around 2 Asian elephants. At one point, a giant panda and Siberian tiger were also part of the Hall&#x27;s collection, originally intended to be part of an adjoining Hall of North Asian Mammals (planned in the current location of Stout Hall of Asian Peoples). These specimens can currently be seen in the Hall of Biodiversity.

Specimens for the Hall of Asian Mammals were collected over six expeditions led by British-born antiques dealer Arthur S. Vernay and Col. John Faunthorpe (as noted by stylized plaques at both entrances). The expeditions were funded entirely by Vernay, who characterized the expense as a British tribute to American involvement in World War I. The first Vernay-Faunthorpe expedition took place in 1922, when many of the animals Vernay was seeking, such as the Sumatran rhinoceros and Asiatic lion, were facing the possibility of extinction. Vernay made many appeals to regional authorities to obtain hunting permits; in later museum-related expeditions headed by Vernay, these appeals helped the museum gain access to areas previously restricted to foreign visitors. Artist Clarence C. Rosenkranz accompanied the Vernay-Faunthorpe expeditions as field artist and painted the majority of the diorama backgrounds in the hall. These expeditions were also well documented in both photo and video, with enough footage of the first expedition to create a feature-length film, &quot;Hunting Tigers in India&quot; (1929).
===New World mammals===
====Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals====
The Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals is on the first floor, directly west of the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall. features 43 dioramas of various mammals of the American continent, north of tropical Mexico. Each diorama places focus on a particular species, ranging from the largest megafauna to the smaller rodents and carnivorans. Notable dioramas include the Alaskan brown bears looking at a salmon after they scared off an otter, a pair of wolves, a pair of Sonoran jaguars, and dueling bull Alaska moose.

The Hall of North American Mammals opened in 1942 with only ten dioramas. Another 16 dioramas were added in 1963. A massive restoration project began in late 2011 following a large donation from Jill and Lewis Bernard. In October 2012 the hall was reopened as the Bernard Hall of North American Mammals.
=====Hall of Small Mammals=====
The Hall of Small Mammals is an offshoot of the Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals, directly to the west of the latter. There are several small dioramas featuring small mammals found throughout North America, including collared peccaries, Abert&#x27;s squirrel, and a wolverine.
==Birds, reptiles, and amphibian halls==

===Sanford Hall of North American Birds===

The Sanford Hall of North American birds is a one-story hall on the third floor, between the Hall of Primates and Akeley Hall&#x27;s second level. There are over 20 dioramas depicting birds from across North America in their native habitats. At the far end of the hall are two large murals by ornithologist and artist Louis Agassiz Fuertes. The hall also has display cases devoted to large collections of warblers, owls, and raptors.

Conceived by museum ornithologist Frank Chapman, the Hall is named for Chapman&#x27;s friend and amateur ornithologist Leonard C. Sanford, who partially funded the hall and also donated the entirety of his own bird specimen collection to the museum. Construction began on the hall&#x27;s dioramas as early as 1902, and the dioramas opened in 1909. They were the first to be exhibited in the museum and are the oldest still on display. The hall was refurbished in 1962.

Although Chapman was not the first to create museum dioramas, he was the first to bring artists into the field with him in the hopes of capturing a specific location at a specific time. In contrast to the dramatic scenes that Akeley created for the African Hall, Chapman wanted his dioramas to evoke a scientific realism, ultimately serving as a historical record of habitats and species facing a high probability of extinction. Each of Chapman&#x27;s dioramas depicted a species, their nests, and of the surrounding habitat in each direction.


===Hall of Birds of the World===
The Hall of Birds of the World is on the south side of the second floor. The global diversity of bird species is exhibited in this hall. 12 dioramas showcase various ecosystems around the world and provide a sample of the varieties of birds that live there. Example dioramas include South Georgia featuring king penguins and skuas, the East African plains featuring secretarybirds and bustards, and the Australian outback featuring honeyeaters, cockatoos, and kookaburras.

===Whitney Memorial Hall of Oceanic Birds===
The Whitney Memorial Wing, originally named after Harry Payne Whitney and comprising 750,000 birds, opened in 1939. Later known as the Hall of Oceanic Birds, it was completed and dedicated in 1953. It was founded by Frank Chapman and Leonard C. Sanford, originally museum volunteers, who had gone forward with creation of a hall to feature birds of the Pacific islands. The hall was designed as a completely immersive collection of dioramas, including a circular display featuring birds-of-paradise. In 1998, the Butterfly Conservatory was installed inside the hall.

===Hall of Reptiles and Amphibians===
The Hall of Reptiles and Amphibians is near the southeast corner of the third floor. It serves as an introduction to herpetology, with many exhibits detailing reptile evolution, anatomy, diversity, reproduction, and behavior. Notable exhibits include a Komodo dragon group, an American alligator, Lonesome George, the last Pinta Island tortoise, and poison dart frogs.
In 1926, W. Douglas Burden, F.J. Defosse, and Emmett Reid Dunn collected specimens of the Komodo Dragon for the museum. Burden&#x27;s chapter &quot;The Komodo Dragon&quot;, in &quot;Look to the Wilderness&quot;, describes the expedition, the habitat, and the behavior of the dragon. The hall opened in 1927 and was rebuilt from 1969 to 1977 at a cost of $1.3 million.

==Biodiversity and environmental halls==

=== Hall of Biodiversity ===
The Hall of Biodiversity is underneath the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall. It opened in May 1998. The hall primarily contains exhibits and objects highlighting the concept of biodiversity, the interactions between living organisms, and the negative impacts of extinction on biodiversity. The hall includes a diorama depicting the Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve rainforest with over 160 animal and plant species. The diorama shows the rainforest in three states: pristine, altered by human activity, and destroyed by human activity. Another attraction in the hall is &quot;The Spectrum of Habitats&quot;, a video wall displaying footage of nine ecosystems. There is a &quot;Transformation Wall&quot;, containing information and stories detailing changes to biodiversity, and a &quot;Solutions Wall&quot;, containing suggestions on how to increase biodiversity.

===Hall of North American Forests===

The Hall of North American Forests is a one-story hall on the museum&#x27;s first floor in between the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall and the Warburg Hall of New York State Environments. It contains ten dioramas depicting a range of forest types from across North America as well as several displays on forest conservation and tree health. The hall was constructed under the guidance of botanist Henry K. Svenson and opened in 1958. Each diorama specifically lists both the location and exact time of year depicted. Trees and plants featured in the dioramas are constructed of a combination of art supplies and actual bark and other specimens collected in the field. The entrance to the hall features a cross section from the Mark Twain Tree, 1,400-year-old sequoia taken from the King&#x27;s River grove on the west flank of the Sierra Mountains in 1891.

===Warburg Hall of New York State Environments===

Warburg Hall of New York State Environments is a one-story hall on the museum&#x27;s ground floor in between the Hall of North American Forests and the Grand Hall. Based on the town of Pine Plains in Dutchess County, New York, the hall gives a multi-faceted presentation of the eco-systems typical of New York. Aspects covered include soil types, seasonal changes, and the impact of both humans and nonhuman animals on the environment. It is named for the German-American philanthropist Felix M. Warburg and opened on May 14, 1951, as the Warburg Memorial Hall of General Ecology. It has changed little since and is now frequently regarded for its retro-modern styling.

===Milstein Hall of Ocean Life===
The Milstein Hall of Ocean Life is in the southeastern quadrant of the first floor, west of the Hall of Biodiversity. It focuses on marine biology, botany and marine conservation. The center of the hall contains a -long blue whale model. The upper level of the hall exhibits the vast array of ecosystems present in the ocean. Dioramas compare and contrast the life in these different settings including kelp forests, mangroves, coral reefs, the bathypelagic, among others. It attempts to show how vast and varied the oceans are while encouraging common themes throughout. The lower half of the hall consists of 15 large dioramas of larger marine organisms. It is on this level that the famous &quot;Squid and the Whale&quot; diorama sits, depicting a hypothetical fight between the two creatures. Other notable exhibits in this hall include the two-level Andros Coral Reef Diorama. 

In 1910, museum president Henry F. Osborn proposed the construction of a large building in the museum&#x27;s southeast courtyard to house a new Hall of Ocean Life in which &quot;models and skeletons of whales&quot; would be exhibited. The hall opened in 1924 and was renovated in 1962. In 1969, a renovation gave the hall a more explicit focus on oceanic megafauna, including the addition of a lifelike blue whale model to replace a popular steel and papier-m√¢ch√© whale model that had hung in the Biology of Mammals hall. Richard Van Gelder oversaw the creation of the hall in its current incarnation. The hall was renovated once again in 2003, this time with environmentalism and conservation being the main focal points, and was renamed after developer Paul Milstein and AMNH board member Irma Milstein. The 2003 renovation included refurbishment of the famous blue whale, suspended high above the exhibit floor; updates to the 1930s and 1960s dioramas; and electronic displays.

==Human origins and cultural halls==

===Cultural halls===

====Stout Hall of Asian Peoples====
The Stout Hall of Asian Peoples is a one-story hall on the museum&#x27;s second floor in between the Hall of Asian Mammals and Birds of the World. It is named for Gardner D. Stout, a former president of the museum, and was primarily organized by Walter A. Fairservis, a longtime museum archaeologist. Opened in 1980, Stout Hall is the museum&#x27;s largest anthropological hall and contains artifacts acquired by the museum between 1869 and the mid-1970s. Many famous expeditions sponsored by the museum are associated with the artifacts in the hall, including the Roy Chapman Andrews expeditions in Central Asia and the Vernay-Hopwood Chindwin expedition.

Stout Hall has two sections: Ancient Eurasia, a small section devoted to the evolution of human civilization in Eurasia, and Traditional Asia, a much larger section containing cultural artifacts from across the Asian continent. The latter section is organized to geographically correspond with two major trade routes of the Silk Road. Like many of the museum&#x27;s exhibition halls, the artifacts in Stout Hall are presented in a variety of ways including exhibits, miniature dioramas, and five full-scale dioramas. Notable exhibits in the Ancient Eurasian section include reproductions from the archaeological sites of Teshik-Tash and √áatalh√∂y√ºk, as well as a full size replica of a Hammurabi Stele. The Traditional Asia section contains areas devoted to major Asian countries, such as Japan, China, Tibet, and India, while also including a vast array of smaller Asian tribes including the Ainu, Semai, and Yakut.
====Hall of African Peoples====
The Hall of African Peoples is behind Akeley Hall of African Mammals and underneath Sanford Hall of North American Birds. It is organized by the four major ecosystems found in Africa: River Valley, Grasslands, Forest-Woodland, and Desert. Each section presents artifacts and exhibits of the peoples native to the ecosystems throughout Africa. The hall contains three dioramas and notable exhibits include a large collection of spiritual costumes on display in the Forest-Woodland section. Uniting the sections of the hall is a multi-faceted comparison of African societies based on hunting and gathering, cultivation, and animal domestication. Each type of society is presented in a historical, political, spiritual, and ecological context. A small section of African diaspora spread by the slave trade is also included. Tribes and civilizations featured include:
*River Valley: Ancient Egyptians, Nubians, Kuba, Lozi
*Grasslands: Pokot, Shilluk, Barawa
*Forest-Woodland: Yoruba, Kofyar, Mbuti
*Desert: Ait Atta, Tuareg

====Hall of Mexico and Central America====

The Hall of Mexico and Central America is a one-story hall on the museum&#x27;s second floor behind Birds of the World and before the Hall of South American Peoples. It presents archaeological artifacts from a broad range of pre-Columbian civilizations that once existed across Mesoamerica, including the Maya, Olmec, Zapotec, and Aztec. Because the great majority of the written records of these civilizations did not survive the Spanish conquest, the overarching aim of the hall is to piece together what it is possible to know about them from the artifacts alone.

The museum has displayed pre-Columbian artifacts since its opening, only a short time after the discovery of the civilizations by archaeologists, with its first hall dedicated to the subject opening in 1899. As the museum&#x27;s collection grew, the hall underwent major renovations in 1944 and again in 1970 when it re-opened in its current form. Notable artifacts on display include the Kunz Axe and a full-scale replica of Tomb 104 from the Monte Alb√°n archaeological site, originally displayed at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair.

==== South American Peoples ====
The Hall of South American Peoples is a one-story hall on the northwestern corner of the second floor, next to the Hall of Mexico and Central America. The hall was first opened on the third floor in 1904, and exhibited archaeological objects, including mummies, from Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and the West Indies. In 1931, the hall was expanded and relocated to the second floor under the direction of curators Ronald Olson and W.C. Bennett. The new hall included a recreation of a Chilean copper mine, and later, a temporary hall titled the Men of the Monta√±a, which featured Peruvian cultural artifacts from the Cashibo, and Panoan peoples. In 1989, the Hall was renovated and reopened as a permanent exhibition, focusing on the technology and artistry of the ancient Andean and traditional Amazonian cultures, led by curators Craig Morris, Junius Bird, and Robert Carneiro. The Hall contains roughly 2,300 objects from various ancient South American cultures, including the Moche, Ch√°vin, Chancay, Paracas, Nazca, and Inca. A number of the artifacts on display come from the Roosevelt Collections, which were collected by Theodore Roosevelt on expeditions to South America in the early 20th century and donated to the museum. 

==== Margaret Mead Hall of Pacific Peoples ====

The Hall of Pacific Peoples is on the southwestern corner of the third floor, accessed through the Hall of Plains Indians. The cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead had founded the Hall of Pacific Peoples in 1971. From the time Mead began curatorial work on the hall in 1945, she conceived an exhibit environment that would emulate sights and sounds from the Pacific regions on display. After Mead&#x27;s death in 1978, the hall reopened in December 1984 as the Margaret Mead Hall of Pacific Peoples. The new hall, designed by Eugene Burgmann, maintained the blue-themed ocean and sky ambiance of the original hall. The hall was once again closed in 1997 and reopened in 2001 with an updated design that retained the geocultural &quot;alcoves&quot; first installed with the 1984 remodel.

The Margaret Mead Hall of Pacific Peoples contains artifacts from New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Micronesia, Melanesia and other Pacific islands. Mead had collected 250 of the 1,500 items in the hall. Some of these were probably selected from the 3,284 items she collected for the American Museum of Natural History during fieldwork in New Guinea and other Pacific island locations, 1928-1939. Others, such as the theatrical set from a puppet play in Bali, were chosen from among the approximately 600 items that Mead and her anthropologist husband Gregory Bateson had sent to the American Museum of Natural History while they were conducting fieldwork in Bali, 1936-1938. The exhibits in the Margaret Mead Hall of Pacific Peoples also include a fiberglass cast of an Easter Island &quot;moai&quot; statue and capes made of honeycreeper feathers.

====Native American halls====

=====Northwest Coast Hall=====

The Northwest Coast Hall is a one-story hall on the museum&#x27;s ground floor behind the Grand Gallery and in between Warburg and Spitzer Halls. it is the museum&#x27;s oldest hall, having been established in 1899 by anthropologist Franz Boas as the Jesup North Pacific Hall. The hall now contains artifacts and exhibits of the tribes of the North Pacific Coast cultural region (Southern Alaska, Northern Washington, and a portion of British Columbia). Featured prominently in the hall are four &quot;House Posts&quot; from the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw nation and murals by William S. Taylor depicting native life. , there are 9,000 items in total, including 78 totem poles, as well as a Haida canoe suspended from the ceiling (relocated from the Grand Gallery in 2020). The artifacts are accompanied by text in numerous Native American languages.
Artifacts in the hall originated from three main sources. The earliest of these was a gift of Haida artifacts collected by John Wesley Powell and donated by future trustee Heber R. Bishop in 1882. This was followed by the museum&#x27;s purchase of two collections of Tlingit artifacts collected by Lt. George T. Emmons in 1888 and 1894. The remainder of the hall&#x27;s artifacts were collected during the famed Jesup North Pacific Expedition between 1897 and 1902. Led by Boas and financed by museum president Morris Ketchum Jesup, the expedition was the first for the museum&#x27;s Division of Anthropology and is now considered the &quot;foremost expedition in American anthropology&quot;. Many famous ethnologists took part, including George Hunt, who secured the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw House Posts in the hall. Other tribes featured in the hall include Coastal Salish, Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsimshian, and Nuxalk.

At the time of its opening, the Northwest Coast Hall was one of four halls dedicated to the native peoples of United States and Canada. It was originally organized in two sections, the first being a general area pertaining to all peoples of the region and the second a specialized area divided by tribe. This was a point of contention for Boas who wanted all artifacts in the hall to be associated with the proper tribe (much like it is currently organized), eventually leading to the dissolution of Boas&#x27;s relationship with the museum. In May 2022, the hall reopened after a five-year, $19 million renovation, with more than 1,000 artifacts on view. The new display includes work from contemporary artists such as Greg Colfax KlaWayHee and Robert Davidson.

=====Hall of Plains Indians=====

The Hall of Plains Indians is on the south side of the third floor, near the western end of the museum. This hall opened in February 1967. The primary focus of this hall is the North American Great Plains peoples as they were at the middle of the 19th century, including depictions of Blackfeet (&quot;see also: Blackfoot Confederacy&quot;), Hidatsa, and Dakota cultures. Of particular interest is a Folsom point discovered in 1926 New Mexico, providing evidence of early American colonization of the Americas.
=====Hall of Eastern Woodlands Indians=====

The Hall of Eastern Woodlands Indians is next to the Hall of Plains Indians, on the south side of the third floor. This hall opened in May 1966. It details the lives and technology of traditional Native American peoples in the woodland environments of eastern North America. These include Cree, Mohegan, Ojibwe, and Iroquois cultures. The exhibit features examples of indigenous basketry, pottery, farming techniques, food preparation, metal jewelry, musical instruments, and textiles. Other highlights include a model of a Menominee birchbark canoe and various traditional lodgings such as an Ojibwa domed wigwam, an Iroquois longhouse, a Creek council house, and other eastern woodland dwelling styles. , the Hall of Eastern Woodlands Indians, along with the Hall of the Plains Indians, is closed to ensure compliance with new NAGPRA regulations.

===Human origins halls===

==== Anne and Bernard Spitzer Hall of Human Origins ====

The Anne and Bernard Spitzer Hall of Human Origins, formerly The Hall of Human Biology and Evolution, is on the south side of the first floor, near the western end of the museum. It opened under its current name on February 10, 2007. When it first opened in 1921, the hall was known as the &quot;Hall of the Age of Man&quot;, the only major exhibition in the United States to present an in-depth investigation of human evolution. The displays traced the story of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, illuminated the path of human evolution and examined the origins of human creativity.

Many of the displays from the original hall can still be viewed in the present expanded format. These include life-size dioramas of human predecessors &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;, &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;, Neanderthal, and Cro-Magnon, showing each species demonstrating the behaviors and capabilities that scientists believe they were capable of. Also displayed are full-sized casts of important fossils, including the 3.2-million-year-old Lucy skeleton and the 1.7-million-year-old Turkana Boy, and &quot;Homo erectus&quot; specimens including a cast of Peking Man. The hall also features replicas of ice age art found in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. The limestone carvings of horses were made nearly 26,000 years ago and are considered to represent some of the earliest artistic expression of humans.

==Earth and planetary science halls==

===Arthur Ross Hall of Meteorites===
The Arthur Ross Hall of Meteorites is on the southwest corner of the first floor. It contains some of the finest specimens in the world including Ahnighito, a section of the 200-ton Cape York meteorite which was first made known to non-Inuit cultures on their investigation of Meteorite Island, Greenland. Its great weight, 34 tons, makes it the largest displayed in the Northern Hemisphere. It has support by columns that extend through the floor and into the bedrock below the museum.

The hall also contains extra-solar nanodiamonds (diamonds with dimensions on the nanometer level) more than 5 billion years old. These were extracted from a meteorite sample through chemical means, and they are so small that a quadrillion of these fit into a volume smaller than a cubic centimeter.
===Allison and Roberto Mignone Halls of Gems and Minerals===

The Allison and Roberto Mignone Halls of Gems and Minerals (formerly the Harry Frank Guggenheim Hall of Gems and Minerals) is on the first floor, north of the Ross Hall of Meteorites. It houses thousands of rare gems, minerals specimens and pieces of jewelry. The halls closed in 2017 to undergo a $32 million redesign by Ralph Appelbaum Associates and reopened to the general public in June 2021. The redesigned exhibits adopt newer philosophies in exhibit design, including a focus on storytelling, interactivity, and connecting ideas across disciplines. The halls explore a range of topics, including the diversification of mineral species over the course of Earth&#x27;s history, plate tectonics, and the stories of specific gems.

The halls display rare samples chosen from among the more than 100,000 pieces in the museum&#x27;s collection including the Star of India, the Patricia Emerald, and the DeLong Star Ruby.
=== David S. and Ruth L. Gottesman Hall of Planet Earth ===
The David S. and Ruth L. Gottesman Hall of Planet Earth is on the first floor at the northeast corner of the museum. Opened in 1999, it is a permanent hall devoted to the history of Earth, from accretion to the origin of life and contemporary human impacts on the planet. The hall was designed to answer five key questions: &quot;How has earth evolved? Why are there ocean basins, continents and mountains? How do scientists read rocks? What causes climate and climate change? Why is earth habitable?&quot; The hall features rocks and other objects collected over 28 expeditions; the oldest rock is 4.3 billion years old, while the youngest was collected from a volcano on the day that it solidified. There is also a 30-seat granite amphitheater, with a globe, at the center of the hall.

Several sections also discuss the studies of Earth systems, including geology, glaciology, atmospheric sciences, and volcanology. The exhibit has several large, touchable rock specimens. The hall features striking samples of banded iron and deformed conglomerate rocks, as well as granites, sandstones, lavas, and three black smokers. The north section of the hall, which deals primarily with plate tectonics, is arranged to mimic the Earth&#x27;s structure, with the core and mantle at the center and crustal features on the perimeter.

==Fossil halls==

=== Storage facilities ===
Most of the museum&#x27;s collections of mammalian and dinosaur fossils remain hidden from public view and are kept in many repositories deep within the museum complex. The most significant storage facility among these is the ten-story Childs Frick Building, which started construction in 1969 and was completed in 1973. When the Frick Building was completed, the museum&#x27;s collection of fossilized mammals and dinosaurs was the world&#x27;s largest such collection, weighing . The Frick Building&#x27;s top three floors contain laboratories and offices.

Other areas of the museum contain repositories of life from the past. The Whale Bone Storage Room is a cavernous space in which powerful winches come down from the ceiling to move the giant fossil bones about. The museum attic upstairs includes even more storage facilities, such as the Elephant Room, while the tusk vault and boar vault are downstairs from the attic.

=== Public displays ===
The great fossil collections that are open to public view occupy the entire fourth floor of the museum. The fourth floor exhibits are accessed by the Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Orientation Center, which opened in 1996. On the 77th Street side of the museum the visitor begins in the Orientation Center and follows a carefully marked path, which takes the visitor along an evolutionary tree of life. As the tree &quot;branches&quot; the visitor is presented with the familial relationships among vertebrates, called cladograms. A video projection on the museum&#x27;s fourth floor introduces visitors to the concept of the cladogram.

Many of the fossils on display represent unique and historic pieces that were collected during the museum&#x27;s golden era of worldwide expeditions (1880s‚Äì1930s). On a smaller scale, expeditions continue into the present and have resulted in additions to the collections from Vietnam, Madagascar, South America, and central and eastern Africa.

==== Halls ====
The first dinosaur hall in the museum opened in 1905. The 4th floor includes the following halls:
*Hall of Vertebrate Origins
*Hall of Saurischian Dinosaurs (recognized by their grasping hand, long mobile neck, and the downward/forward position of the pubis bone, they are forerunners of the modern bird)
*Hall of Ornithischian Dinosaurs (defined for a pubic bone that points toward the back)
*Hall of Primitive Mammals
*Hall of Advanced Mammals

The dinosaur halls were temporarily closed for renovation starting in 1990. The first halls to reopen were the primitive-mammal and advanced-mammal halls, part of the Lila Acheson Wallace Wing of Mammals and Their Extinct Relatives, which opened in 1994. The Halls of Saurischian Dinosaurs and Ornithischian Dinosaurs reopened in 1995 as part of a $12 million expansion. The Hall of Vertebrate Origins opened in 1996.

==== Fossils on display ====

The fossils on display include:
*&quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;: Composed almost entirely of real fossil bones, it is mounted in a horizontal stalking pose balanced on powerful legs. The specimen is actually composed of fossil bones from two &quot;T. rex&quot; skeletons discovered in Montana in 1902 and 1908 by famous dinosaur hunter Barnum Brown.
*&quot;Mammuthus&quot;: Larger than its relative the woolly mammoth, these fossils are from an animal that lived 11,000 years ago in Indiana.
*&quot;Apatosaurus&quot; or &quot;Brontosaurus&quot;: This giant specimen was discovered at the end of the 19th century. Although most of its fossil bones are original, the skull is not, since none was found on site. The skeleton is composed primarily of the specimen AMNH 460, as well as specimens AMNH 222, AMNH 339, AMNH 592, and casts of the &quot;Brontosaurus excelsus&quot; holotype YPM 1980. It was only many years later that the first &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; skull was discovered, and so a plaster cast of that skull was made and placed on the museum&#x27;s mount. A &quot;Camarasaurus&quot; skull had been used mistakenly until a correct skull was found. It is not entirely certain whether this specimen is a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; or an &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, and therefore it is considered an &quot;unidentified apatosaurine&quot;, as it could also potentially be its own genus and species.
*&quot;Brontops&quot;: Extinct mammal distantly related to the horse and rhinoceros. It lived 35 million years ago in what is now South Dakota. It is noted for its magnificent and unusual pair of horns.
*A skeleton of &quot;Edmontosaurus annectens&quot;, a large herbivorous ornithopod dinosaur. The specimen is an example of a &quot;mummified&quot; dinosaur fossil in which the soft tissue and skin impressions were imbedded in the surrounding rock. The specimen is mounted as it was found, lying on its side with its legs drawn up and head drawn backwards.
*On September 26, 2007, an 80-million-year-old, diameter fossil of an ammonite, which is composed entirely of the gemstone ammolite, made its debut at the museum. Neil Landman, curator of fossil invertebrates, explained that ammonites (shelled cephalopod mollusks in the subclass Ammonoidea) became extinct 66 million years ago, in the same extinction event that killed the dinosaurs. Korite International donated the fossil after its discovery in Alberta, Canada.
*One skeleton of an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; scavenging from a &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; corpse based on fossils found at Bone Cabin Quarry preserving large bite marks on Apatosaurine vertebrae.
*The only known skull of &quot;Andrewsarchus mongoliensis&quot;.
*A display of various species of ground sloths including &quot;Megalocnus rodens&quot;, &quot;Scelidotherium cuvieri&quot;, &quot;Megalonyx wheatleyi&quot; and &quot;Glossotherium robustus&quot;
A &quot;Triceratops&quot; and a &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; are also both on display, among many other specimens.

Besides the fossils in museum display, many specimens are stored in the collections available for scientists. Those include important specimens such as complete diplodocid skull, tyrannosaurid teeth, sauropod vertebrae, and many holotypes.

==Rose Center for Earth and Space==
The Hayden Planetarium, connected to the museum, is now part of the Rose Center for Earth and Space on the north side of the museum. The original Hayden Planetarium was founded in 1933 with a donation by philanthropist Charles Hayden, and it opened in 1935. The AMNH announced the modern Rose Center for Earth and Space in early 1995, and demolition began the same year.

The Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space was completed in 2000 at a cost of $210 million. Designed by James Stewart Polshek, the new building consists of a six-story high glass cube enclosing an illuminated sphere that appears to float, although it is actually supported by truss work. Polshek has referred to his work as a &quot;cosmic cathedral&quot;. The sphere is known as the Space Theater.

The facility encloses of research, education, and exhibition space as well as the Hayden planetarium. Also in the facility is the Department of Astrophysics, the newest academic research department in the museum. Neil DeGrasse Tyson is the director of the Hayden Planetarium. In addition, Polshek designed the Weston Pavilion, a high transparent structure of &quot;water white&quot; glass along the museum&#x27;s west facade. This structure, a small companion piece to the Rose Center, offers a new entry way to the museum as well as opening further exhibition space for astronomically related objects. The Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway is one of the most popular exhibits in the Rose Center.

==Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education and Innovation==
Designed by Studio Gang and landscape architects Reed Hilderbrand, the Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education and Innovation opened in May 2023. The 230,000-square-foot addition includes six floors above ground, and one below. The Gilder Center welcomes visitors with a new, accessible entrance on Columbus Avenue that connects to central five-story atrium and creates more than 30 connections to the existing museum. The atrium&#x27;s architecture is informed by natural processes like the movement of wind and water that shape geological landscapes. To achieve the continuous visual form, the atrium is constructed with shotcrete. The curvilinear fa√ßade contrasts with the earlier High Victorian Gothic, Richardson Romanesque, and Beaux Arts structures, but its Milford Pink granite cladding is the same stone used on the Museum&#x27;s west side. 

The Richard Gilder Center houses new exhibition and display areas devoted to insects, including an insectarium and butterfly vivarium, where visitors can walk among hundreds of live specimens as they flutter about in a lush tropical setting. It also includes a visible storage structure that houses and displays scientific specimens; an expanded research library; classrooms and education areas, and laboratories. Another permanent fixture is an immersive and interactive video experience called ‚ÄúInvisible Worlds‚Äù that focuses on the vital, often hard-to-see connections that support life, such as the firing of brain neurons, the exchange of nutrients and water between tree roots, and the microscopic world of plankton in ocean ecosystems. 

This expansion was originally supposed to be north of the existing museum, occupying parts of Theodore Roosevelt Park. The expansion was relocated to the west side of the existing museum, and its footprint was reduced in size, due to opposition to construction in the park. The annex replaced three existing buildings along Columbus Avenue&#x27;s east side.

==Exhibitions Lab==

Founded in 1869, the AMNH Exhibitions Lab has since produced thousands of installations. The department is notable for its integration of new scientific research into immersive art and multimedia presentations. In addition to the famous dioramas at its home museum and the Rose Center for Earth and Space, the lab has also produced international exhibitions and software such as the Digital Universe Atlas.

The exhibitions team currently consists of over sixty artists, writers, preparators, designers and programmers. The department is responsible for the creation of two to three exhibits per year. These extensive shows typically travel nationally to sister natural history museums. They have produced, among others, the first exhibits to discuss Darwinian evolution, human-induced climate change and the mesozoic mass extinction via asteroid.

==Research Library==
The Research Library is open to staff and public visitors, and is on the fourth floor of the museum. The Library collects materials covering such subjects as mammalogy, earth and planetary science, astronomy and astrophysics, anthropology, entomology, herpetology, ichthyology, paleontology, ethology, ornithology, mineralogy, invertebrates, systematics, ecology, oceanography, conchology, exploration and travel, history of science, museology, bibliography, genomics, and peripheral biological sciences. The collection has many retrospective materials, some going back to the 15th century, that are difficult to find elsewhere.

In its early years, the Library expanded its collection mostly through such gifts as John Clarkson Jay&#x27;s conchological library, Carson Brevoort&#x27;s library on fishes and general zoology, Daniel Giraud Elliot&#x27;s ornithological library, S. Lowell Elliot&#x27;s collection of books and pamphlets on various subjects, Harry Edwards&#x27;s entomological library, the Hugh Jewett collection of voyages and travel, and Jules Marcou&#x27;s geology collection. In the 1900s, the library continued to grow with donations from figures and organizations such as Egbert Viele, the American Ethnological Society, Joel Asaph Allen, Hermon Carey Bumpus, and Henry Fairfield Osborn.

The new Library was designed by the firm Roche-Dinkeloo in 1992. The space is and includes five different &quot;conservation zones&quot;, including the 50-person reading room, public offices, and temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms. Today, the Library&#x27;s collections contain over 550,000 volumes of monographs, serials, pamphlets, reprints, microforms, and original illustrations, as well as film, photographic, archives and manuscripts, fine art, memorabilia and rare book collections.

Special collections include:
*Institutional Archives, Manuscripts, and Personal Papers: Includes archival documents, field notebooks, clippings and other documents relating to the museum, its scientists and staff, scientific expeditions and research, museum exhibitions, education, and general administration.
*Art and Memorabilia Collection.
*Moving Image Collection.
*Vertical Files: Relating to exhibitions, expeditions, and museum operations.

==Activities==

===Research activities===

The museum has a scientific staff of more than 225, and sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year. Many of the fossils on display represent unique and historic pieces that were collected during the museum&#x27;s golden era of worldwide expeditions (1880s‚Äì1930s). Examples of some of these expeditions, financed in whole or part by the AMNH are: Jesup North Pacific Expedition, the Whitney South Seas Expedition, the Roosevelt‚ÄìRondon Scientific Expedition, the Crocker Land Expedition, and the expeditions to Madagascar and New Guinea by Richard Archbold. On a smaller scale, expeditions continue into the present. The museum also publishes several peer-reviewed journals, including the &quot;Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History&quot;.

==== Southwestern Research Station ====
The AMNH operates a biological field station in Portal, Arizona, among the Chiricahua Mountains. The Southwestern Research Station was established in 1955, purchased with a grant from philanthropist David Rockefeller, and with entomologist Mont Cazier as its first director. The station, in a &quot;biodiversity hotspot&quot;, is used by researchers and students, and offers occasional seminars to the public.

===Educational outreach===
AMNH&#x27;s education programs include outreach to schools in New York City by the Moveable Museum. The AMNH offers a wide variety of educational programs, camps, and classes for students from pre-K to post-graduate levels. The AMNH sponsors the Lang Science Program, a comprehensive 5th‚Äì12th grade research and science education program, and the Science Research Mentorship Program (SRMP), in which pairs of students conduct a full year of intensive original research with an AMNH scientist. , about 400,000 schoolchildren annually take field trips to the AMNH. Although most students visit for a day or less, since late 2023 the museum has also provided a weeklong educational program called Beyond Elementary Explorations in Science.

=== Richard Gilder Graduate School ===
On October 23, 2006, the museum launched the Richard Gilder Graduate School, becoming the first American museum in the United States to award doctoral degrees in its own name. The school is named for businessman Richard Gilder, who contributed $50 million toward the school. Accredited in 2009, the school had 11 students enrolled in 2011, who work closely with curators and have access to the collections. The first seven graduates were awarded their degrees in 2013. The AMNH offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) in Earth Science and a PhD in Comparative Biology.

The MAT Earth Science Residency program was launched in 2012 to address a critical shortage of qualified science teachers in New York state. In 2015, the MAT program officially joined the Richard Gilder Graduate School, with the NYS Board of Regents authorizing the Gilder School to grant the MAT degree.

==Notable people==
===Presidents===
The museum&#x27;s first three presidents were all cofounders. John David Wolfe served from 1869 until his death in 1872; he was followed by Robert L. Stuart, who resigned in 1881. The third president, Morris K. Jesup, was president for over 25 years, serving until his death in 1908. Upon his death, Jesup bequeathed $1 million to the museum.

The fourth president, Henry Fairfield Osborn, appointed on the death of Jesup, consolidated the museum&#x27;s expansion and developed it further. Under Osborn, the museum embraced a growing eugenics movement. Osborn&#x27;s friend, noted eugenicist Madison Grant, a member of the museum&#x27;s executive committee, was the author of the 1916 book, The Passing of the Great Race. He also was a funder and shaper of the 1921 Second International Congress of Eugenics, held at the museum. Davenport presided also the 1932 Third International Eugenics Congress.

After Osborn resigned in 1933, F. Trubee Davison became the AMNH&#x27;s fifth president. Davison stepped down in 1951, and Alexander M. White was elected as the museum&#x27;s president. Gardner D. Stout then served as president from 1968 to 1975, when Robert Guestier Goelet was elected in his place. Goelet served until 1987, when he was placed on the board of trustees. He was succeeded by George D. Langdon Jr., the first president in the museum&#x27;s history to receive a salary; all previous presidents had served without pay.

Ellen V. Futter became the museum&#x27;s first female president in 1993. Futter announced in June 2022 that she planned to step down when the Gilder Center opened in March 2023. Sean M. Decatur was named as Futter&#x27;s successor in December 2022 and became the first African American president of the museum on April 3, 2023.

===Other associated names===
Famous names associated with the museum include the dinosaur-hunter of the Gobi Desert, Roy Chapman Andrews (one of the inspirations for Indiana Jones); photographers Yvette Borup Andrews and George Gaylord Simpson; biologists Ernst Mayr and Stephen Jay Gould; pioneer cultural anthropologists Franz Boas and Margaret Mead; explorer and geographer Alexander H. Rice Jr.; and ornithologist Robert Cushman Murphy.

==Surroundings==
The museum is at 79th Street and Central Park West. There is a direct entrance into the museum from the New York City Subway&#x27;s station, served by the .

On a pedestal outside the museum&#x27;s Columbus Avenue entrance is a stainless steel time capsule, which was created after a design competition that was won by Santiago Calatrava. The capsule was sealed at the beginning of 2000, to mark the beginning of the 3rd millennium. It takes the form of a folded saddle-shaped volume, symmetrical on multiple axes, that explores formal properties of folded spherical frames. Calatrava described it as &quot;a flower&quot;. The capsule is to be opened in the year 3000.

The museum is in a city park known as Theodore Roosevelt Park that extends from Central Park West to Columbus Avenue, and from West 77th to 81st Streets and that contains park benches, gardens and lawns, and also a dog run. On the west side of the park, between 80th and 81st Streets near Columbus Avenue, is the Nobel Monument honoring Nobel Prize winners from the United States.

==Commentary==
In 2019, Hamid Dabashi, the Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, wrote an opinion piece in Al Jazeera criticizing a bronze statue of Theodore Roosevelt, depicting him on horseback above a nameless Native American and African American individual. Having visited the museum, Dabashi reflected on the juxtaposition of scientific progress and what he sees as the persistent legacy of racism in the United States. The statue of Theodore Roosevelt is seen by Dabashi as a symbol of racial hierarchy and the ongoing struggle to reconcile the nation&#x27;s past with its present. The statue would later be removed in 2022, as a consequence of discussions about racism aroused by the 2020 protests surrounding the killing of George Floyd.

A 2020 article by University of New Hampshire historian Julia Rodriguez contrasts the approaches respectively taken by the AMNH and the Mus√©e de l&#x27;Homme in Paris, in terms of their human and cultural exhibits. While Rodriguez criticizes the AMNH&#x27;s exhibits for their failure to acknowledge colonial histories, the Mus√©e de l&#x27;Homme has made strides in decolonizing its displays. Rodriguez also posits that notably absent from such museums are exhibits dedicated to Northern European or New England cultures, suggesting a biased focus on &quot;othering&quot; non-Western societies while normalizing Western cultural norms.

In a June 2024 essay published in Indian online paper ThePrint, Stanford University history professor Priya Satia argues that the museum&#x27;s Hall of Asian Peoples is problematic because it portrays Asian cultures as static and frozen in time. Satia believes various misrepresentations can lead to misunderstandings and perpetuate harmful biases against Asian and Middle Eastern people. In the same essay, Satia also delves into parts of the museum&#x27;s own history, such as its 1921 hosting of the Second International Eugenics Congress. Her essay was criticized by Samuel Abrams, who serves as a Nonresident Senior Fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, as a researcher at NYU, and as a Professor of Politics at Sarah Lawrence College. Abrams states that &quot;Critiquing an outdated museum is fine, but nothing about Satia‚Äôs thread was constructive or helpful.&quot;
==In popular culture==

The museum is featured in many works of art and popular culture, including:
*A large portion of the 2017 film &quot;Wonderstruck&quot; takes place in the museum, showing the museum in 1927 as well as 1977.
*The museum in the film &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; (2006) is based on a 1993 book that was set at the AMNH (&quot;The Night at the Museum&quot;). The interior scenes were shot at a sound stage in Vancouver, British Columbia, but exterior shots of the museum&#x27;s facade were done at the actual AMNH. AMNH officials have credited the movie with increasing the number of visitors during the holiday season in 2006 by almost 20¬†percent. Its sequels, &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; (2009) and &quot;Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb&quot; (2014), were also partially set in this museum.
*The main characters of the 2023 graphic novel &quot;Roaming&quot; visit the AMNH. 
*The museum was the setting for the 1970 novel &quot;The Great Dinosaur Robbery&quot; by David Forrest, but was not featured in the film adaptation &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot;, which was set in the Natural History Museum in London, England. 
*As the &quot;New York Museum of Natural History&quot;, the museum is a favorite setting in many Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child novels, including &quot;Relic&quot; (1995), &quot;Reliquary&quot; (1997), &quot;The Cabinet of Curiosities&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot; (2007). FBI Special Agent Aloysius X. L. Pendergast plays a major role in all of these thrillers. Preston was manager of publications at the museum before embarking upon his fiction writing career. 
*The museum has appeared repeatedly in the fiction of dark fantasy author Caitl√≠n R. Kiernan, including appearances in her fifth novel &quot;Daughter of Hounds&quot;, her work on the DC/Vertigo comic book &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (#47, &quot;Trinket&quot;), and many of her short stories, including &quot;Valentia&quot; and &quot;Onion&quot; (both collected in &quot;To Charles Fort, With Love&quot;, 2005). 
*The 2005 film &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot; takes its name from the diorama of the giant squid and the sperm whale in the museum&#x27;s Hall of Ocean Life. The diorama is shown in the film&#x27;s final scene. 
*The plot of the 1993 film &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot; revolves around the museum, with all four dinosaurs finally reaching the AMNH at the end. 
*In the 1955 Czechoslovak film, &quot;Journey to the Beginning of Time&quot;, (Czech: Cesta do pravƒõku, literally &quot;Journey into prehistory&quot;) the four boys end their journey on a bench inside the AMNH&#x27;s 77th St. entrance, beneath the exhibit of the long-boat, in which they&#x27;d had their adventure. While the story could be dismissed as a dream, one boy&#x27;s journal has somehow suffered all the wear-and-tear of their journey through prehistoric eras. A dubbed and partly re-filmed US version of the film was released in 1966 under the title &quot;Journey to the Beginning of Time&quot;. 
*The 1914 animated film &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; was set in the Museum. 
*In the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, Ross works in the museum from 1994 until he is fired in 1999. In the 1996 episode &quot;The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know&quot;, Ross and Rachel have sex in one of the exhibits, stunning a group of schoolchildren when they wake up the following morning.

<text>Peter Simon Pallas FRS FRSE (22 September 1741 ‚Äì 8 September 1811) was a Prussian zoologist, botanist, ethnographer, explorer, geographer, geologist, natural historian, and taxonomist. He studied natural sciences at various universities in early modern Germany and worked primarily in the Russian Empire between 1767 and 1810.

== Life and work ==
Peter Simon Pallas was born in Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia, the son of Professor of Surgery Simon Pallas. He studied with private tutors and took an interest in natural history, later attending the University of Halle and the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1760, he moved to the University of Leiden and passed his doctor&#x27;s degree at the age of 19.

Pallas travelled throughout the Dutch Republic and to London, improving his medical and surgical knowledge. He then settled at The Hague, and his new system of animal classification was praised by Georges Cuvier. Pallas wrote &quot;Miscellanea Zoologica&quot; (1766), which included descriptions of several vertebrates new to science which he had discovered in the Dutch museum collections. A planned voyage to Southern Africa and the East Indies fell through when his father recalled him to Berlin. There, he began work on his &quot;Spicilegia Zoologica&quot; (1767‚Äì1780).
In 1767, Pallas was invited by Catherine II of Russia to become a professor at the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences and, between 1768 and 1774, he led an expedition to central Russian provinces, Povolzhye, Urals, West Siberia, Altay, and Transbaikal, collecting natural history specimens for the academy. He explored the Caspian Sea, the Ural and Altai Mountains, and the upper Amur River, reaching as far eastward as Lake Baikal. The regular reports which Pallas sent to St Petersburg were collected and published as &quot;Reise durch verschiedene Provinzen des Russischen Reichs&quot; (&quot;Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire&quot;, 3 vols., 1771‚Äì1776). They covered a wide range of topics, including geology and mineralogy, ethnographic reports on the native Eurasian peoples and their indigenous religions, and descriptions of new plants and animals. In 1776, Pallas was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Pallas settled in St Petersburg, becoming a favourite of Catherine II and teaching natural history to the Grand Dukes Alexander and Constantine. He was provided with the plants collected by other naturalists to compile the &quot;Flora Rossica&quot; (1784‚Äì1815), a Russian flora, and started work on his &quot;Zoographica Rosso-Asiatica&quot; (1811‚Äì31), a zoography of Russia and Asia. He also published an account of Johann Anton G√ºldenst√§dt&#x27;s travels in the Caucasus. The Empress bought Pallas&#x27;s large natural history collection for 2,000 rubles, 500 more than his asking price, and allowed him to keep them for life. During this period, Pallas helped plan the Mulovsky expedition, which was cancelled in October 1787.
Between 1793 and 1794, Pallas led a second expedition to southern Russia, visiting the Crimea and the Black Sea. He was accompanied by his daughter (by his first wife who had died in 1782) and his new wife, an artist, servants, and a military escort. In February 1793, they travelled to Saratov and then downriver to Tsaritsyn. They explored the country to the east, and in August travelled along the banks of the Caspian Sea and into the Caucasus Mountains. In September, they travelled to the Crimea, wintering in Simferopol. Pallas spent early 1794 exploring to the southeast, and in July travelled up the valley of the Dnieper, arriving back in St Petersburg in September. Pallas gave his account of the journey in his &quot;P. S. Pallas Bemerkungen auf einer Reise in die S√ºdlichen Statthalterschaften des Russischen Reichs&quot; (1799‚Äì1801). Catherine II gave him a large estate at Simferopol, where Pallas lived until the death of his second wife in 1810. He was then granted permission to leave Russia by Emperor Alexander, and returned to Berlin, where he died in the following year. His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.
In 1809 he became an associate member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

==Pallasite==
In 1772, Pallas was shown a 680-kg lump of metal that had been found near Krasnoyarsk. Pallas arranged for it to be transported to St Petersburg. Subsequent analysis of the metal showed it to be a new type of stony-iron meteorite. This new type of meteorite was called pallasite after him; the meteorite itself is named Krasnojarsk or sometimes Pallas Iron (the name given to it by Ernst Chladni in 1794).

==Commemorated==
Several animals were described by Pallas, and his surname is included in their common names, including: Pallas&#x27;s glass lizard, Pallas&#x27;s viper, Pallas&#x27;s cat, Pallas&#x27;s long-tongued bat, Pallas&#x27;s tube-nosed bat, Pallas&#x27;s squirrel, Pallas&#x27;s leaf warbler, Pallas&#x27;s cormorant, Pallas&#x27;s fish-eagle, Pallas&#x27;s gull, Pallas&#x27;s sandgrouse, Pallas&#x27;s rosefinch, and Pallas&#x27;s grasshopper warbler.

Also, he is honoured in the scientific names of animals described by others, including: the Dagestani tortoise (&quot;Testudo graeca pallasi&quot;), Pallas&#x27;s pika (&quot;Ochotona pallasi&quot;), Pallas&#x27;s reed bunting (&quot;Emberiza pallasi&quot;), the East Siberian grayling (&quot;Thymallus pallasii&quot;) and the Pacific herring (&quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;).

He was also honoured in the name of a plant genus, &quot;Petrosimonia&quot; which is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae.

Streets in Berlin and Castrop-Rauxel are named &quot;Pallasstra√üe&quot;. Pallasovka, a city in Volgograd Oblast, is named after him, and his monument stands there.

An asteroid is named after him: 21087 Petsimpallas. A Belgian astronomer, Eric Elst chose the name &quot;Sarapul 26851&quot; for an asteroid because in Pallas&#x27;s writings, he mentioned his liking of the city of Sarapul, Russia.

Pallas was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1791.

<text>Wild Orchid was an American girl group consisting of Stacy Ferguson, Stefanie Ridel, and Renee Sandstrom. Beginning under the name &quot;NRG&quot; in 1990, the group changed their name to Wild Orchid in 1992 and signed with RCA Records in 1994. The group released two albums, earning Billboard Music Awards nominations with their debut. In 2001, Ferguson left the group. Sandstrom and Ridel continued as a duo, releasing Wild Orchid&#x27;s final album &quot;Hypnotic&quot; in 2003. In 2013, &quot;Us Weekly&quot; named the group number 18 of the 25 &#x27;Best Girl Groups of All Time&#x27;.

==History==

=== 1990-96: Formation and &quot;At Night I Pray&quot; ===
Wild Orchid began in 1990 when former &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; cast members Renee Sandstrom and Stacy Ferguson and their friend Stefanie Ridel decided to form an all-girl group based on their shared love of music and poetry, and they originally called themselves New Rhythm Generation, or NRG. Heather Holyoak soon joined the group and they began searching for a record contract. As they wrote their songs and recorded their first single, entitled &quot;Get Crazy ‚Äì Work It,&quot; the girls also began coming up with choreographies for their music.

In February 1991, NRG gave their first performance in a Los Angeles nightclub. Heather Holyoak returned to college, and was replaced by Micki Duran. In July 1991, NRG performed to a sold-out crowd at a BMI showcase. Their former manager claimed that he owned the rights to the group&#x27;s name. By 1992, the group changed their name to Wild Orchid and hired Marta Marrero, mother of fellow &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; alumna Martika, as their new manager.

Wild Orchid joined forces with several record labels including RCA, EMI, and Capitol, eventually signing with Sony Publishing and RCA Records in 1994. Ron Fair became the group‚Äôs A&amp;R rep, eventually co-producing their first album. Duran left the group to work on the Nickelodeon TV show &quot;Roundhouse,&quot; leaving Wild Orchid as a trio. In 1995, Wild Orchid recorded the theme song for the NBC sitcom &quot;Hope &amp; Gloria&quot;.

The group&#x27;s first single &quot;At Night I Pray&quot; charted at number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and on the R&amp;B Singles charts at number 49 in November 1996. A music video directed by Marcus Nispel, known for his work with Janet Jackson, was in heavy rotation on MTV, BET and VH1.

=== 1997-98: &quot;Wild Orchid&quot; ===
In March 1997, Wild Orchid released their self-titled debut album &quot;Wild Orchid&quot;. The largely self-written album sold nearly a million units worldwide (including 108,000 units in the U.S. according to SoundScan) and included the singles &quot;Talk to Me&quot;, &quot;At Night I Pray&quot; and &quot;Supernatural&quot;. &quot;Talk to Me&quot; received two &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award nominations in the categories of Best clip and Best new artist clip.

Wild Orchid spent most of 1997 promoting their debut album, making appearances on various TV shows such as &quot;Oddville, MTV,&quot; &quot;The RuPaul Show&quot;, Vibe, &quot;Mad TV&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot;, and &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;, in addition to a guest appearance on the UPN sitcom &quot;Goode Behavior&quot;. The group were frequent guest hosts on E!&#x27;s &quot;The Gossip Show&quot;. The trio toured as an opening act for 98 Degrees and &#x27;N Sync across the U.S. 

In May 1998, they released dance remixes of their songs &quot;I Won&#x27;t Play the Fool&quot; and &quot;Follow Me&quot; (from their debut album) which were underground club hits. The &quot;I Won&#x27;t Play the Fool&quot; remix landed on a Top 10 Dance Remixes Chart of 1998 in &quot;Billboard&quot;. That same month, they performed at &quot;Divas Simply Singing&quot;, an annual AIDS benefit concert in Los Angeles hosted by Sheryl Lee Ralph.

In 1998, Wild Orchid were featured on the song &quot;I Will Show You Mine‚Äù on the album &quot;Home Again&quot; from Dutch singer Rene Froger.

In 1999, the group filmed a pilot presentation as the stars of a television program called &quot;Sirens&quot;. In the vein of female-driven action programs like &quot;&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, they portrayed crime fighting pop singers who were secretly mermaids. The pilot was not picked up to series.

=== 1998-99: &quot;Oxygen&quot; and tours ===
In September 1998, they released their second album, &quot;Oxygen,&quot; which included the first and only single &quot;Be Mine&quot;. The album sold 22,000 copies in the U.S. according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. The album release coincided with the group&#x27;s stint as Guess spokespersons and models. They embarked on a brief promotional tour throughout the U.S., continued to host on E!&#x27;s &quot;The Gossip Show&quot;, and performed &quot;Be Mine&quot; on &quot;Donny and Marie&quot;. 

That month, Wild Orchid debuted as hosts of the Fox Family Channel&#x27;s Saturday morning show &quot;Great Pretenders&quot;, which featured chart hits lip-synched by young kids, while competing for prizes. This show lasted four seasons, from 1998 to 2001.

In February 1999, the group performed &quot;Declaration&quot; and &quot;Come As You Are&quot; at the fictional Peach Pit After Dark during the ninth season of the FOX primetime soap drama &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (episode titled &quot;Beheading St. Valentine&quot;).

In summer 1999, they opened for Cher&#x27;s Do You Believe? Tour alongside Cyndi Lauper, which toured at 52 cities across the U.S. and Canada. For a period in 1999, there were rumors of the group re-recording songs for a re-release of their &quot;Oxygen&quot; album, due to poor sales of the original version. A remixed version of their ballad &quot;Come As You Are&quot; was leaked onto the Internet, but a reworked &quot;Oxygen&quot; was never officially released.

In November 1999, the group appeared in the Macy&#x27;s Annual Thanksgiving Parade where they sang a two-minute clip of their song &quot;25 Days Of Christmas&quot;.

=== 1999-2001: &quot;Fire&quot; and Ferguson&#x27;s departure ===
Between 1999 and 2000, the group worked on their third album &quot;Fire&quot;, which included several tracks co-written and produced by JC¬†Chasez of *NSYNC. The album was slated for an August 2000 release according to &quot;Billboard&quot;, however the release date was eventually pushed back to June 2001. The track &quot;It&#x27;s All Your Fault&quot;, which was slated to be on &quot;Fire&quot;, was featured in the 2000 film &quot;What Women Want&quot;, but was not included on the film soundtrack.

In May 2001, the group released the first single from their album &quot;Fire,&quot; called &quot;Stuttering (Don&#x27;t Say)&quot;, which reached #33 on the Billboard Top 40 Singles Sales chart, and had a concert special on MuchUSA called &quot;Shoutback&quot; on July 29, 2001. They also became models for Bongo Jeans. The group co-wrote the song &quot;What&#x27;s Good 4 the Goose&quot;, which appeared on pop group Eden&#x27;s Crush debut album &quot;Popstars (&quot;2001). Wild Orchid went on a U.S. promotional tour for &quot;Fire&quot; between May and July 2001, where they performed mainly in clubs and small venues with other teen-pop acts.

The newer release date for &quot;Fire&quot; was shifted to June 5, 2001, then eventually June 19; however their record label RCA ultimately declined to release it. This event marked the beginning of the end of Wild Orchid as a trio. On July 19, 2001, the group performed their last concert together at Sea World in San Diego. On July 24, 2001, they filmed their final episode of &quot;Great Pretenders&quot;, and the show was cancelled ten days later upon the announcement that Fox Family Channel was merging with Disney-owned ABC.

In September 2001, the group was dropped from RCA, and Ferguson left Wild Orchid.

Between 2002 and 2003, Wild Orchid returned as a duo with Sandstrom and Ridel. Their album &quot;Hypnotic&quot; was released on the group&#x27;s website in January 2003, and reportedly sold 5000 copies online. On September 26, 2006, &quot;Talk To Me: Hits, Rarities &amp; Gems&quot; was released by Sony BMG Special Products. It is fundamentally a greatest-hits package, featuring previously released songs from &quot;Wild Orchid&quot; and &quot;Oxygen&quot; in addition to the only released single from &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Stuttering (Don&#x27;t Say)&quot; and its B-side, &quot;Lies&quot;.

== Solo efforts ==
On May 28, 2001, Minneapolis-based radio station KDWB hosted a concert which featured both Wild Orchid and hip-hop group the Black Eyed Peas. It was during this event that Stacy Ferguson met will.i.am, spoke to him about producing her solo album, and exchanged phone numbers with him. In 2002, she joined the Black Eyed Peas under the stage name &#x27;Fergie.&#x27;

Renee Sandstrom is now primarily a session singer for children&#x27;s music. In 2004, she provided the singing voice for &#x27;Princess Fiona&#x27; in the &quot;Shrek 2&quot; special feature &quot;Far Far Away Idol&quot;. Her vocals have been featured on several Disney albums, including &quot;Mousercise&quot; (2007), &quot;Disney Cuties&quot; (2008), the &quot;Camp Rock&quot; soundtrack (2008), and &quot;Playhouse Disney Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (2010). In 2007, she sang with Ruben Martinez in &quot;Just Like We Dreamed It&quot;, which was the theme song for the 15th anniversary of Disneyland Resort Paris. The song was released as a single exclusively in France on March 31, 2007. Sandstrom wrote the music for the song &quot;On Penguin Pond&quot;, featured on the Volume One soundtrack for Jim Henson Company&#x27;s &quot;Sid the Science Kid&quot; (2009).

Stefanie Ridel co-founded the Talent Bootcamp, in which she teaches young aspiring musical artists. Between 2004 and 2005, Ridel was the lead singer for the techno-dance duo &#x27;5th Element&#x27; with DJ Rain, and their album was released exclusively online on DJ Rain&#x27;s website. Ridel&#x27;s singing voice was heard on the &quot;&quot; soundtrack (2007), in which she sang the lead on two songs and co-wrote and co-produced many others. Ridel is married to former Wild Orchid producer and Geffen Records president Ron Fair. They have four children together.

<text>James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose (1612 ‚Äì 21 May 1650) was a Scottish nobleman, poet, soldier and later viceroy and captain general of Scotland. Montrose initially joined the Covenanters in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, but subsequently supported King Charles I as the English Civil War developed. From 1644 to 1646, and again in 1650, he fought in the civil war in Scotland on behalf of the King. He is referred to as the Great Montrose.

Following his defeat and capture at the Battle of Carbisdale, Montrose was tried by the Scottish Parliament and sentenced to death by hanging, followed by beheading and quartering. After the Restoration, Charles II paid ¬£802 sterling for a lavish funeral in 1661. Montrose&#x27;s reputation later changed from traitor or martyr to a romantic hero and subject of works by Walter Scott and John Buchan. His spectacular victories, which took his opponents by surprise, are remembered in military history for their tactical brilliance.

== Background and family ==
James Graham, Chief of Clan Graham, was the youngest of six children and the only son of John Graham, 4th Earl of Montrose, and Lady Margaret Ruthven. The exact date and place of his birth are unknown, but it was probably in mid-October. His maternal grandparents were William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, and Dorothea Stewart, a daughter of Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven and his second wife Janet Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl.

Montrose studied at age twelve at the college of Glasgow under William Forrett who later tutored his sons. At Glasgow, he read Xenophon and Seneca, and Tasso in translation. In the words of biographer John Buchan, his favourite book was a &quot;splendid folio of the first edition&quot; of &quot;History of the World&quot; by Walter Raleigh. Montrose became 5th Earl of Montrose by his father&#x27;s death in 1626. He was then educated at Saint Salvator&#x27;s College at the University of St Andrews.

At the age of seventeen, he married Magdalene Carnegie, who was the youngest of six daughters of David Carnegie (afterwards Earl of Southesk). They were parents of four sons, among them James Graham, 2nd Marquess of Montrose.

Montrose traveled extensively in Europe through France, Italy and the German principalities. He had a famous love-affair with Princess Louise Hollandine, daughter of the Elector Palatine and sister of Prince Rupert of the Rhine.

== Covenanter to royalist ==
In 1638, after King Charles I had attempted to impose an Episcopalian version of the Book of Common Prayer upon the reluctant Scots, resistance spread throughout the country, eventually culminating in the Bishops&#x27; Wars. Montrose joined the party of resistance, and was for some time one of its most energetic champions. He had nothing puritanical in his nature, but he shared in the ill-feeling aroused by the political authority King Charles had given to the bishops. He signed the National Covenant, and was part of Alexander Leslie&#x27;s army sent to suppress the opposition which arose around Aberdeen and in the country of the Gordons. Though often cited as commander of the expedition, the Aberdeen Council letter books are explicit that the troops entered Aberdeen &quot;under the conduct of General Leslie&quot; who remained in charge in the city until 12 April. Three times Montrose entered Aberdeen. On the second occasion, the leader of the Gordons, the Marquess of Huntly entered the city under a pass of safe conduct but ended up accompanying Montrose to Edinburgh, with his supporters saying as a prisoner and in breach of the pass, but Cowan is clear Huntly chose to go voluntarily, rather than as prisoner, noting &quot;by giving out he had been forced to accompany Montrose he was neatly easing his own predicament and at the same time sparing Montrose a great deal of embarrassment&quot;. Spalding also supports that Huntly went voluntarily. Montrose was a leader of the delegation who subsequently met at Muchalls Castle to parley regarding the 1638 confrontation with the Bishop of Aberdeen. With the Earl Marischal he led a force of 9000 men across the Causey Mounth through the Portlethen Moss to attack Royalists at the Battle of the Brig of Dee. These events played a part in Charles I&#x27;s decision to grant major concessions to the Covenanters.

In July 1639, after the signing of the Treaty of Berwick, Montrose was one of the Covenanting leaders who visited Charles. His change of mind, eventually leading to his support for the King, arose from his wish to get rid of the bishops without making Presbyterians masters of the state. His was essentially a layman&#x27;s view of the situation. Taking no account of the real forces of the time, he aimed at an ideal form of society in which the clergy should confine themselves to their spiritual duties, and the king should uphold law and order. In the Scottish parliament which met in September, Montrose found himself opposed by Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, who had gradually assumed leadership of the Presbyterian and national party, and of the estate of burgesses. Montrose, on the other hand, wished to bring the King&#x27;s authority to bear upon parliament to defeat Argyll, and offered the King the support of a great number of nobles. He failed, because Charles could not even then consent to abandon the bishops, and because no Scottish party of any weight could be formed unless Presbyterianism were established as the ecclesiastical power in Scotland.

Rather than give way, Charles prepared in 1640 to invade Scotland. Montrose was of necessity driven to play something of a double game. In August 1640 he signed the Bond of Cumbernauld as a protest against the particular and direct practising of a few, in other words, against the ambition of Argyll. But he took his place amongst the defenders of his country, and in the same month displayed his gallantry in action at the forcing of the River Tyne at Newburn. On 27 May 1641 he was summoned before the Committee of Estates and charged with intrigues against Argyll, and on 11 June he was imprisoned by them in Edinburgh Castle. Charles visited Scotland to give his formal assent to the abolition of Episcopacy, and upon the King&#x27;s return to England, Montrose shared in the amnesty tacitly accorded to all Charles&#x27;s partisans.

== Wars of the Three Kingdoms ==
The king signed a warrant for his Marquessate and appointed Montrose Lord Lieutenant of Scotland, both in 1644. A year later in 1645, the king commissioned him captain general. His military campaigns were fought quickly and used the element of surprise to overcome his opponents even when sometimes dauntingly outnumbered. At one point, Montrose dressed himself as the groom of the Earl of Leven and travelled away from Carlisle, and the eventual capture of his party, in disguise with &quot;two followers, four sorry horses, little money and no baggage&quot;.

Highlanders had never before been known to combine, but Montrose knew that many of the West Highland clans, who were largely Catholic, detested Argyll and his Campbell clansmen, and none more so than the MacDonalds who with many of the other clans rallied to his summons. The Royalist allied Irish Confederates sent 2000 disciplined Irish soldiers led by Alasdair MacColla across the sea to assist him. The Irish proved to be formidable fighters.

In two campaigns, distinguished by rapidity of movement, he met and defeated his opponents in six battles. At Tippermuir and Aberdeen he routed Covenanting levies; at Inverlochy he crushed the Campbells, at Auldearn, Alford and Kilsyth his victories were obtained over well-led and disciplined armies.

The fiery enthusiasm of the Gordons and other clans often carried the day, but Montrose relied more upon the disciplined infantry from Ireland. His strategy at Inverlochy, and his tactics at Aberdeen, Auldearn and Kilsyth furnished models of the military art, but above all his daring and constancy marked him out as one of the great soldiers of his time. His career of victory was crowned by the great Battle of Kilsyth on 15 August 1645. Such was the extent of his military fame that King Louis XIV offered him the position of Marshal of France.
Now Montrose found himself apparently master of Scotland. After Kilsyth, the king&#x27;s secretary arrived with letters from Charles documenting that Montrose was lieutenant and captain general. He first conferred knighthood on Alasdair. Then he summoned a parliament to meet at Glasgow on 20 October, in which he no doubt hoped to reconcile loyal obedience to the King with the establishment of a non-political Presbyterian clergy. That parliament never met. Charles had been defeated at the Battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645, and Montrose had to come to his aid if there was to be still a king to proclaim. David Leslie, one of the best Scottish generals, was promptly dispatched against Montrose to anticipate the invasion. On 12 September he came upon Montrose, who had been deserted by his Highlanders and was guarded only by a little group of followers, at Philiphaugh. He won an easy victory. Montrose cut his way through to the Highlands; but he failed to organise an army. In September 1646 he embarked for Norway. Stories of his victories as documented in Latin by George Wishart reached the continent and he was offered an appointment as lieutenant-general in the French army, and the Emperor Ferdinand III awarded him the rank of field marshal, but Montrose remained devoted to the service of King Charles and to his son, Charles II.


Montrose was to appear once more on the stage of Scottish history. In June 1649, eager to avenge the death of the King, he was restored by the exiled Charles II to the now nominal lieutenancy of Scotland. Charles, however, did not scruple soon afterwards to disavow his noblest supporter to become King on terms dictated by Argyll and his adherents. In March 1650, Montrose landed in Orkney to take command of a small force which he had sent on before him with George Hay, 3rd Earl of Kinnoull. Crossing to the mainland, he tried in vain to raise the clans, and on 27 April was surprised and routed at the Battle of Carbisdale in Ross-shire. His forces were defeated in battle but he escaped. After wandering for some time, he was surrendered by Neil MacLeod of Assynt at Ardvreck Castle, to whose protection, in ignorance of MacLeod&#x27;s political enmity, he had entrusted himself. He was brought a prisoner to Edinburgh, and on 20 May sentenced to death by the parliament. He was hanged on the 21st, with Wishart&#x27;s laudatory biography of him around his neck. He protested to the last that he was in truth a Covenanter and a loyal subject. Grant states that the execution was overseen by the Edinburgh City Guard under command of Major Weir.

His head was removed and stood on the &quot;prick on the highest stone&quot; of the Old Tolbooth outside St Giles&#x27; Cathedral from 1650 until the beginning of 1661.

Shortly after Montrose&#x27;s death, the Scottish Argyll Government switched sides to support Charles II&#x27;s attempt to regain the English throne, provided he was willing to impose the Solemn League and Covenant in England for a trial period at least. After the Restoration, Montrose was officially rehabilitated in the public memory.

On 7 January 1661, Montrose&#x27;s mangled torso was disinterred from the gallows ground on the Burgh Muir and carried under a velvet canopy to the Tolbooth, where his head was reverently removed from the spike, before the procession continued on its way to Holyrood Abbey. The diarist John Nicoll wrote the following eyewitness account of the event:

Montrose&#x27;s limbs were brought from the towns to which they had been sent (Glasgow, Perth, Stirling and Aberdeen) and placed in his coffin, as he lay in state at Holyrood. A splendid funeral was held in the church of St. Giles on 11 May 1661.

The torso of an executed person would have normally been given to friends or family; but Montrose was the subject of an excommunication, which was why it was originally buried in unconsecrated ground. In 1650 his niece, Lady Napier, had sent men by night to remove his heart. This relic she placed in a steel case made from his sword and placed the whole in a gold filigree box, which had been presented to her family by a Doge of Venice. The heart in its case was retained by the Napier family for several generations until lost amidst the confusion of the French Revolution.

== Battle history ==

Montrose had successive victories at the Battle of Tippermuir, with the support of Alasdair MacColla and his Irish soldiers, the Battle of Aberdeen, the Battle of Inverlochy, the Battle of Auldearn, the Battle of Alford, and the Battle of Kilsyth, which was the largest battle of the conflict in Scotland. After several years of continuous victories, Montrose was finally defeated at the Battle of Philiphaugh on 13 September 1645 by the Covenanter army of David, Lord Newark, restoring the power of the Committee of Estates.

 In March 1650 he captured Dunbeath Castle of the Clan Sinclair, who would later support him at Carbisdale. Montrose was defeated at the Battle of Carbisdale by the Munros, Rosses, Sutherlands and Colonel Archibald Strachan.

<text>Meghanada (, ), also referred to by his epithet Indrajita (), according to Hindu texts, was the eldest son of Ravana and the crown prince of Lanka, who conquered Indraloka (Heaven). He is regarded as one of the greatest warriors in Hindu texts. He is a major character mentioned in the Indian epic &quot;Ramayana.&quot; Meghanada is the central character in Bengali epic poem &quot;Meghnad Badh Kavya&quot;. He played an active role in the great war between Rama and Ravana. He acquired many kinds of celestial weapons from his Guru Shukra. His most prominent feat is having defeated the devas in heaven. Using the Brahmastra, Indrajita killed 670 million vanaras in a single day; nearly exterminating the entirety of the vanara race. No warrior had ever achieved this statistical feat before in the Ramayana. He is the only warrior in the entire Ramayana to defeat both Rama and Lakshmana twice while they were both armed by making them unconscious in a battle with the help of astras and sorcery (once by using &quot;Nagapashastra&quot; and another time by using Brahmastra) and finally got killed by Lakshmana. He was said to be more powerful and superior warrior than his father Ravana by Brahma and Agastya.

==Etymology==

Indrajita had the special ability to fight from the sky, hidden behind the clouds. That is why both Rama and Lakshmana were defeated during the battle and were tied up by the snake. In Sanskrit, the literal translation of the name &quot;Indrajita&quot; (‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§ø‡§§) is mentioned as the &quot;Conqueror of Indra. He defeated Indra, the king of the devas, after which he came to be known as &quot;Indrajita&quot; (the conqueror of Indra). He is also known as Shakrajit, Ravani, Vasavajit, Varidanada, and Ghananada.

==Early life==

Indrajita was the eldest son of Ravana and his wife Mandodari. He was named Meghanada after his birth because his birth cry sounded like thunder. However, Shani (Saturn) had disobeyed Ravana&#x27;s orders and had settled in the 12th house of Meghanada&#x27;s horoscope. Ravana became furious at this and blamed Shani. Due to the state of Shani, Meghanada had to die at the hands of Lakshmana in the war between Prince Rama and Ravana.

Meghanada was also an expert in magical warfare, sorcery and tantra. His wife is not mentioned in the original epic; however in later versions of the epic, Sulochana‚Äîthe daughter of the King of the serpents Shesha Naga‚Äîis mentioned as his wife.

==Brahma&#x27;s boon==

During the battle between the devas and Ravana, Indra, king of heavens accompanied by all other devas captured Ravana. To rescue his father, Meghanada grabbed Indra and held him by the waist. He dragged Indra to his celestial chariot and held him tightly around the waist. He brought Indra as a prisoner to the palace in Lanka. Meghanada kept Indra locked in his residence for years and tortured him physically and mentally. Ravana and Meghanada decided to kill Indra. At this juncture, Brahma intervened and asked Meghanada to free Indra. Meghanada obliged and was granted a chance to ask for a boon from Brahma. Meghanada asked for immortality, but Brahma remarked that absolute immortality is against the law of the nature. Instead, he was then granted another boon that after the completion of the Yagna (fire-worship) of his native goddess Prathyangira or the &quot;Nikumbhila yagna&quot; would be completed, he will get a celestial chariot, mounting on which, any enemy can&#x27;t kill him in a war and become invulnerable. But Brahma also cautioned him that whosoever would destroy this yagna, would also kill him. Brahma was highly impressed by Meghanada&#x27;s valor in this war and it was Brahma who coined him the name Indrajita (&quot;the conqueror of Indra&quot;). It is also believed that Meghanada was granted another boon by Brahma in which it was promised to him that he would only be killed by a common man who hadn&#x27;t slept for 14 years continuously.

==Role in battle==

Meghanada was the greatest warrior on Ravana&#x27;s side. He was a great archer and unsurpassed grand master in illusion warfare techniques.

===First Day===

On the first day of his battle with Rama&#x27;s army, Indrajita was fast with his weapons. Angada jumped onto Indrajit&#x27;s chariot and destroyed it while killing his horses and charioteer and defeated Meghnada in battle. Immediately, Indrajit became invisible and went into the clouds, from where he attacked and swiftly wiped out the armies of Sugriva, calling on Rama and Lakshmana to come in a direct combat by his illusion tactics of sorcery, so he could avenge the deaths of his paternal uncle and his brothers. When Lakshmana appeared before him, he fought fiercely. Ram grievously wounded him using shabd-bhed arrows and Lakshman was about to kill him using Bramhastra but Ram resisted him from doing so citing that it&#x27;s against the rules of warfare to attack an invisible opponent. Ram declared that he would end Meghnada once and for all and Meghnada predicting Ram&#x27;s intentions, ran away from the battlefield. Meghnada used his most nefarious weapon &quot;Nagapasha&quot; (a trap made of a million snakes). They were rescued by Garuda on behest of Hanuman. Garuda was the paternal uncle of Jatayu and Sampati and the enemy of the serpents and also the flying vehicle of Vishnu, of whom Rama was the seventh avatar.

===Second Day===

When Indrajita discovered that both Rama and Lakshmana had been rescued by Garuda and were still alive, he was livid and vowed to kill at least one of the brothers on that day. When the battle started, he used all his force to cast a havoc on the armies of Sugriva. At this Lakshmana appeared before him and fought him fiercely. Indrajita used his supreme magical powers, darting across the clouds and skies like a bolt of lightning. He combined his skills of sorcery and illusion warfare, repeatedly vanishing and reappearing behind Lakshmana&#x27;s back. He was invisible but his arrows hit Lakshmana. Still he wasn&#x27;t able to match Lord Lakshmana and found him unbeatable. Indrajita used the &quot;Pranghatini&quot; &quot;Sakthi&quot; against Lakshmana from his behind, and upon being impaled Lakshmana fell unconscious, poised to die precisely at the following sunrise. His life was saved by Hanuman, who brought the whole mountain of Dronagiri from the Himalayas to Lanka overnight to find the remedy (the magical herb - &quot;Sanjivani&quot;) for the weapon used by Indrajita and cured him. Although there is false speculation that Rama fought, too. Dharma does not allow multiple warriors to fight against one and it was only Lakshmana who was injured because it is against moral duty to fight against an invisible warrior.

===Third day===

When Indrajita learned that Lakshmana had survived again, he went to his native deity&#x27;s secret temple to perform the yagna that would make him a warrior who can&#x27;t be killed by anyone. Vibhishana, Indrajita&#x27;s paternal uncle who left Ravana to join Rama, learned of his nephew Indrajita&#x27;s plans through his spies and alerted Rama. Lakshmana and Vibhisana took the opportunity to face Indrajita in the Yagnaagar. As the Valmiki Ramayana quotes, upon his Yagna being destroyed by the armies of Lakshmana and his treacherous plan failed, Indrajita became enraged and stormed out of the Temple Cave. 
Seeing his uncle Vibhishana at Lakshmana&#x27;s side multiplied Indrajita&#x27;s fury manyfold. He vowed to kill his uncle Vibhisana along with Lakshmana once and for all, letting loose the Yama-astra which he had been conserving for punishing Vibhishana&#x27;s perceived treason. At this juncture, Lakshmana protected Vibhishana, countering the Yama-astra owing to an earlier warning by Kubera. He fought with Lord Lakshmana but was badly overpowered and wounded by him. Sensing his death, he released the ultimate weapons of the divine Trinity ( the Bramhastra of Lord Bramha, the Vaishnavastra of Lord Narayana, and the Pashupatastra of Lord Shiva). But to his surprise, all these weapons came back after saluting Lord Lakshmana. Indrajit realised that Lakshmana was not an ordinary human and had met the criteria to defeat Indrajita, i.e. blunder the yagna and not sleep for more than 14 years. Indrajita vanished briefly from the battlefield, returning to Ravana at the royal palace, and reported the developments, proposing that his father make peace with Rama as it&#x27;s impossible to win over divine incarnations, Lord Shree Rama and Lord Lakshmana. Ravana, blinded with pride, was unrelenting and annoyed, claiming that Indrajita was a coward for having fled the battlefield. This accusation provoked Indrajita who briefly lost his temper, striking fear even at the mighty Ravana&#x27;s heart before apologizing and clarifying to his father that his primary duty as a son was to serve his father&#x27;s best interests and that even in the face of death, he would never abandon Ravana. Preparing to return to the battle and knowing that he indeed faced death at the hands of a heavenly incarnation, Indrajita said his last goodbyes to his parents and his wife. He returned to the battlefield and fought Lakshmana with all his skill at both illusion warfare and sorcery. The arrows of Indrajita refused to harm Lakshmana because Lakshmana was the incarnation of Shesha. Lakshmana slew Indrajita by beheading him with the Anjalikastra. It was possible only because of a curse given to Indrajita by Shesha for marrying his daughter without his permission. Shesha incarnated as Rama&#x27;s brother Lakshmana, to kill Indrajita, didn&#x27;t have any sleep for more than fourteen years during their exile so that he would be able to serve Rama and Sita efficiently and meet the criteria to kill Indrajita.

<doc id="400008" wikidata="Q546198" url="?curid=400008" title="Golden Hind">
<text>Golden Hind was a galleon captained by Francis Drake in his circumnavigation of the world between 1577 and 1580. She was originally known as &quot;Pelican,&quot; but Drake renamed her mid-voyage in 1578, in honour of his patron, Sir Christopher Hatton, whose crest was a golden hind (a female red deer). Hatton was one of the principal sponsors of Drake&#x27;s world voyage. A full-sized, seaworthy reconstruction is in London, on the south bank of the Thames.

== History ==

Queen Elizabeth I partly sponsored Sir Francis Drake as the leader of an expedition intended to pass around South America through the Strait of Magellan and to explore the coast that lay beyond. The queen&#x27;s support was advantageous; Drake had official approval to benefit himself and the queen and cause the maximum damage to the Spaniards. This eventually culminated in the Anglo‚ÄìSpanish War. Before setting sail, Drake met the queen face-to-face for the first time and she said to him, &quot;We would gladly be revenged on the King of Spain for divers injuries that we have received.&quot;

The explicit object was to &quot;find out places meet to have traffic.&quot; Drake, however, acted as a privateer, with unofficial support from Elizabeth. The design of the &quot;Golden Hind&quot; was based on the Spanish built &quot;nao Victoria&quot;, the first ship to circumnavigate the world, and is described as a &quot;mid-16th-century warship during the transition from the carrack to the galleon,&quot; and measured about 120 tons. He first named his flagship &quot;Pelican&quot;, but renamed her &quot;Golden Hind&quot; on 20 August 1578 to honour his patron, Sir Christopher Hatton, whose family crest was a golden hind. He set sail in December 1577 with five small ships with a complement of 164 and reached the Brazilian coast in early 1578.

On 1 March 1579, now in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Ecuador, &quot;Golden Hind&quot; challenged and captured the Spanish galleon . This galleon had the largest treasure captured to that date: over 360,000 pesos (equivalent to around ¬£480 million in 2017). The treasure took six days to transship and included 26 tons of silver, half a ton of gold, porcelain, jewellery, coins, and jewels.

On 26 September 1580, Francis Drake sailed his ship into Plymouth Harbour with 56 of the original crew of 80 left aboard. The ship was unloaded at Trematon Castle nearby, supervised by the Queen&#x27;s guards. The final treasure also included six tons of cloves from the Spice Islands, at the time worth their weight in gold. Elizabeth herself went aboard &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, which was then permanently at Deptford on the south bank of the Thames, where she had requested it be placed on permanent display as the first museum ship. There, she shrewdly asked the French ambassador to bestow a knighthood on Drake. Over half of the proceeds went to the crown - her share of the treasure came to at least ¬£160,000: &quot;enough to pay off her entire government debt and still have ¬£40,000 left over to invest in a new trading company for the Levant. Her return, and that of other investors, was more than ¬£47 for every ¬£1 invested, or 4,700%.&quot;

After Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation, &quot;Golden Hind&quot; was maintained for public exhibition at the dockyard at Deptford, London. The ship remained there from 1580 to around 1650, 45 years after Elizabeth had died, before the ship eventually rotted away and was broken up. In 1668, the keeper of the stores at Deptford, John Davies of Camberwell, had the best remaining timber of &quot;Golden Hind&quot; made into a chair now called the &quot;Drake Chair&quot; which was presented to the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, where it remains (with a replica in the Great Hall, Buckland Abbey, Devon, Drake&#x27;s home and now maintained by the National Trust).

A table, known as the cupboard, in the Middle Temple Hall, London is also reputed to have been made from the wood of &quot;Golden Hind.&quot; Upon the cupboard is placed the roll of members of Middle Temple, which new members sign when they are called to the Bar. The ship&#x27;s lantern was hung in the vestibule of Middle Temple Hall, but was destroyed during the Second World War.

== Replicas ==
===Essex===
A replica of &quot;Golden Hind&quot; was constructed at Peter Pan&#x27;s Playground (now Adventure Island adventure park), Southend-on-Sea, Essex. It was constructed in 1947 and opened in 1949 together with a waxworks. By 1992, attendances had dropped, and combined with rising maintenance costs with the need for a major renovation to the wooden structure caused its closure in 1997. The ship was replaced by a replica of Blackbeard&#x27;s &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, which was demolished in 2013.

===Devon===

A replica of &quot;Golden Hind&quot; has been permanently moored in the harbour of the sea port of Brixham in Devon () since 1963 following its use in the TV series &quot;Sir Francis Drake&quot;, which was filmed in and around the bays of Torbay and Dartmouth. The replica ship used in the TV series cost the film studio ¬£25,000 to construct. It had no rear gallery or gun deck and was a converted fishing boat. The ship sank in heavy seas whilst under tow in 1987 to Dartmouth for restoration and could not be saved. A second replica was completed in 1988 and stands in the harbour being visited by thousands of visitors annually. The current vessel based on a steel barge is not full size and could never sail.

===London===
====Present day====
&quot;Golden Hinde&quot;, a full-size reconstruction of the ship, was built by traditional methods in Appledore, Devon, and launched in 1973. &quot;Golden Hinde&quot; was the result of three years research and construction. Since then, she has travelled more than 140,000 miles (225,000¬† km). She sailed from Plymouth on her maiden voyage in late 1974, arriving on 8 May 1975 in San Francisco. In 1979, she sailed to Japan to make the miniseries &quot; Sh≈çgun&quot;, after which she returned to the UK having completed a circumnavigation. Between 1981 and 1984, she was berthed in England and was established as an educational museum. In 1984‚Äì85, she sailed around the British Isles and then crossed the Atlantic to St Thomas in the Caribbean. In 1986, she passed through the Panama Canal to sail on to Vancouver, where she was the main attraction in the Marine Plaza at Expo86. In 1987, she began a tour of US coastal cities, spending two years on the Pacific coast. In late 1988, she passed back through the Panama Canal to continue port visits on the Gulf and east coasts of the US. In 1992, she returned home to the UK and spent the next four years visiting ports in Europe. Since 1996, she has been berthed at St Mary Overie Dock, in Bankside, Southwark, London, where she is open to the public and hosts a range of educational programmes.

====1920s====
A replica of &quot;Golden Hind&quot; formed part of the children&#x27;s playground at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition, on the recommendation of Agatha Christie.

<doc id="400010" wikidata="Q579515" url="?curid=400010" title="Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem">
<text>In statistics, the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem, sometimes referred to as the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell‚ÄìKolmogorov theorem, is a result that characterizes the transformation of an arbitrarily crude estimator into an estimator that is optimal by the mean-squared-error criterion or any of a variety of similar criteria.

The Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem states that if &quot;g&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is any kind of estimator of a parameter Œ∏, then the conditional expectation of &quot;g&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) given &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), where &quot;T&quot; is a sufficient statistic, is typically a better estimator of Œ∏, and is never worse. Sometimes one can very easily construct a very crude estimator &quot;g&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), and then evaluate that conditional expected value to get an estimator that is in various senses optimal.

The theorem is named after C.R. Rao and David Blackwell. The process of transforming an estimator using the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem can be referred to as Rao‚ÄìBlackwellization. The transformed estimator is called the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator.

==Definitions==
*An estimator Œ¥(&quot;X&quot;) is an &quot;observable&quot; random variable (i.e. a statistic) used for estimating some &quot;unobservable&quot; quantity. For example, one may be unable to observe the average height of &quot;all&quot; male students at the University of X, but one may observe the heights of a random sample of 40 of them. The average height of those 40‚Äîthe &quot;sample average&quot;‚Äîmay be used as an estimator of the unobservable &quot;population average&quot;.
*A sufficient statistic &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is a statistic calculated from data &quot;X&quot; to estimate some parameter Œ∏ for which no other statistic which can be calculated from data X provides any additional information about Œ∏. It is defined as an &quot;observable&quot; random variable such that the conditional probability distribution of all observable data &quot;X&quot; given &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) does not depend on the &quot;unobservable&quot; parameter Œ∏, such as the mean or standard deviation of the whole population from which the data &quot;X&quot; was taken. In the most frequently cited examples, the &quot;unobservable&quot; quantities are parameters that parametrize a known family of probability distributions according to which the data are distributed.
::In other words, a sufficient statistic &quot;T(X)&quot; for a parameter Œ∏ is a statistic such that the conditional probability of the data &quot;X&quot;, given &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), does not depend on the parameter Œ∏.

*A Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator Œ¥1(&quot;X&quot;) of an unobservable quantity Œ∏ is the conditional expected value E(Œ¥(&quot;X&quot;) | &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) of some estimator Œ¥(&quot;X&quot;) given a sufficient statistic &quot;T&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). Call Œ¥(&quot;X&quot;) the &quot;original estimator&quot; and Œ¥1(&quot;X&quot;) the &quot;improved estimator&quot;. It is important that the improved estimator be &quot;observable&quot;, i.e. that it does not depend on Œ∏. Generally, the conditional expected value of one function of these data given another function of these data &quot;does&quot; depend on Œ∏, but the very definition of sufficiency given above entails that this one does not.
*The &quot;mean squared error&quot; of an estimator is the expected value of the square of its deviation from the unobservable quantity being estimated of Œ∏.

==The theorem==

===Mean-squared-error version===
One case of Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem states:

:The mean squared error of the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator does not exceed that of the original estimator.

In other words,

:formula_1

The essential tools of the proof besides the definition above are the law of total expectation and the fact that for any random variable &quot;Y&quot;, E(&quot;Y&quot;2) cannot be less than [E(&quot;Y&quot;)]2. That inequality is a case of Jensen&#x27;s inequality, although it may also be shown to follow instantly from the frequently mentioned fact that

:formula_2

More precisely, the mean square error of the Rao-Blackwell estimator has the following decomposition

:formula_3

Since formula_4, the Rao-Blackwell theorem immediately follows.

===Convex loss generalization===
The more general version of the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem speaks of the &quot;expected loss&quot; or risk function:

:formula_5

where the &quot;loss function&quot; &quot;L&quot; may be any convex function. If the loss function is twice-differentiable, as in the case for mean-squared-error, then we have the sharper inequality

:formula_6

==Properties==
The improved estimator is unbiased if and only if the original estimator is unbiased, as may be seen at once by using the law of total expectation. The theorem holds regardless of whether biased or unbiased estimators are used.

The theorem seems very weak: it says only that the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator is no worse than the original estimator. In practice, however, the improvement is often enormous.

==Example==
Phone calls arrive at a switchboard according to a Poisson process at an average rate of Œª per minute. This rate is not observable, but the numbers &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; of phone calls that arrived during &quot;n&quot; successive one-minute periods are observed. It is desired to estimate the probability &quot;e&quot;‚àíŒª that the next one-minute period passes with no phone calls.

An &quot;extremely&quot; crude estimator of the desired probability is

:formula_7

i.e., it estimates this probability to be 1 if no phone calls arrived in the first minute and zero otherwise. Despite the apparent limitations of this estimator, the result given by its Rao‚ÄìBlackwellization is a very good estimator.

The sum

:formula_8

can be readily shown to be a sufficient statistic for Œª, i.e., the &quot;conditional&quot; distribution of the data &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, depends on Œª only through this sum. Therefore, we find the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator

:formula_9

After doing some algebra we have

:formula_10

Since the average number of calls arriving during the first &quot;n&quot; minutes is &quot;n&quot;Œª, one might not be surprised if this estimator has a fairly high probability (if &quot;n&quot; is big) of being close to

:formula_11

So Œ¥1 is clearly a very much improved estimator of that last quantity. In fact, since &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; is complete and Œ¥0 is unbiased, Œ¥1 is the unique minimum variance unbiased estimator by the Lehmann‚ÄìScheff√© theorem.

==Idempotence==
Rao‚ÄìBlackwellization is an idempotent operation. Using it to improve the already improved estimator does not obtain a further improvement, but merely returns as its output the same improved estimator.

==Completeness and Lehmann‚ÄìScheff√© minimum variance==
If the conditioning statistic is both complete and sufficient, and the starting estimator is unbiased, then the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator is the unique &quot;best unbiased estimator&quot;: see Lehmann‚ÄìScheff√© theorem.

An example of an improvable Rao‚ÄìBlackwell improvement, when using a minimal sufficient statistic that is not complete, was provided by Galili and Meilijson in 2016. Let formula_12 be a random sample from a scale-uniform distribution formula_13 with unknown mean formula_14 and known design parameter formula_15. In the search for &quot;best&quot; possible unbiased estimators for formula_16 it is natural to consider formula_17 as an initial (crude) unbiased estimator for formula_18 and then try to improve it. Since formula_17 is not a function of formula_20, the minimal sufficient statistic for formula_18 (where formula_22 and formula_23), it may be improved using the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem as follows:

:formula_24

However, the following unbiased estimator can be shown to have lower variance:

:formula_25

And in fact, it could be even further improved when using the following estimator:

:formula_26

The model is a scale model. Optimal equivariant estimators can then be derived for loss functions that are invariant.

<text>is a railway operator in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. Its sole line, officially named the , operates as a through-service extension of the Mid≈çsuji Line of the Osaka Metro.

 is a third-sector railway - 54% owned by Hankyu Corporation, a major component of the wider Hankyu Hanshin Toho Group, and 25% owned by Osaka Prefecture. &quot;Kitakyu&quot;, as it is often abbreviated, also owns various commercial and residential properties along the line. It is not to be confused with an earlier railway company called which operated a section of the Hankyu Senri Line (between Awaji and Senriyama) and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (between J≈´s≈ç and Awaji) from 1919 until 1928, when it was merged into Keihan Electric Railway.

==History==
Planning for the Kita-Osaka Kyuko Railway began on 23 May 1966 as part of preparatory works for the 1970 World&#x27;s Fair. Although the line was originally envisioned as a straightforward extension of the Mid≈çsuji Line, the city government was unable to independently build and complete the extension because it went beyond municipal boundaries, thus raising issues of expropriation and financing. The Kita-Osaka Kyuko Railway Company was established on 11 December 1967 under the as a result of the efforts of Takeo Miki, then Minister of International Trade and Industry, who brokered the deal creating said company as a joint venture between the City of Osaka and Hankyu Railway.

The line began construction on 16 July 1968 and was opened on 24 February 1970, to connect the then northern terminus of the Mid≈çsuji Line, , with the grounds of the 1970 World&#x27;s Fair. The Expo link was closed on 14 September, and the line was redirected to the new underground terminal station of . The temporary tracks between Senri-Ch≈´≈ç and the Expo Park were removed following the Expo, and the right-of-way repurposed as part of the Chugoku Expressway.

A plan to extend the line northward from Senri-Chuo to the city of Minoh was proposed in 1989. The Minoh municipal government exchanged a letter of confirmation with Hankyu and Kitakyu regarding studies of the extension in 2011, and the government of Osaka Prefecture joined a four-party memorandum of understanding in 2012.

On 19 January 2017, construction began on the extension of the line to , which will have one intermediate station at . Completion of the extension was originally scheduled for 2020; in May 2019, the extension&#x27;s scheduled opening date was delayed to 2023 because of construction problems. The scheduled opening of the extension was set for the end of 2023, but was later pushed back further to 23 March 2024.

<text>The Islamic Development Bank (, abbreviated as IsDB) is a multilateral development finance institution that is focused on Islamic finance for infrastructure development and located in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. There are 57 shareholding member states with the largest single shareholder being Saudi Arabia.

==History==
It was founded in 1973 by the Finance Ministers at the first Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now called the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) with the support of the King of Saudi Arabia at the time (Faisal), and began its activities on 3 April 1975.

On 22 May 2013, IsDB tripled its authorized capital to $150 billion to better serve Muslims in member and non-member countries. The Bank has received credit ratings of AAA from Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, Moody&#x27;s, and Fitch. Saudi Arabia holds about one quarter of the bank&#x27;s paid up capital. The IDB is an observer at the United Nations General Assembly.

== Membership ==
The present membership of the Bank consists of 57¬†countries. The basic condition for membership is that the prospective member country should be a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation¬†(OIC), pay its contribution to the capital of the Bank and be willing to accept such terms and conditions as may be decided upon by the IsDB¬†Board of Governors.

Ranked on the basis of paid-up capital (as of May 2024), major shareholders include:
# Saudi Arabia (22.5%)
# Libya (9.03%)
# Indonesia (7.94%)
# Iran (7.90%)
# Nigeria (7.33%)
# Qatar (6.87%)
# Egypt (6.77%)
# Kuwait (6.62%)
# United Arab Emirates (6.48%)
# Turkey (6.17%)

== Structure ==

IDB has evolved into a group of five entities, consisting of Islamic Development Bank¬†(IsDB), Islamic Development Bank Institute (IsDBI), Islamic Corporation for Development of the Private Sector¬†(ICD), Islamic Corporation for Insurance of Investment and Export Credit¬†(ICIEC) and International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC).

== Activities ==
IDB Group is engaged in a wide range of specialized and integrated activities such as:

* Project financing in the public and private sectors;
* Development assistance for poverty alleviation;
* Technical assistance for capacity-building;
* Economic and trade cooperation among member countries;

<doc id="400016" wikidata="Q235121" url="?curid=400016" title="Lady Mary Wortley Montagu">
<text>Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (n√©e Pierrepont; 15 May 168921 August 1762) was an English aristocrat, medical pioneer, writer, and poet. Born in 1689, Lady Mary spent her early life in England. In 1712, Lady Mary married Edward Wortley Montagu, who later served as the British ambassador to the Sublime Porte. Lady Mary joined her husband on the Ottoman excursion, where she was to spend the next two years of her life. During her time there, Lady Mary wrote extensively on her experience as a woman in Ottoman Constantinople. After her return to England, Lady Mary devoted her attention to the upbringing of her family before dying of cancer in 1762.

Although having regularly socialised with the court of George I and George Augustus, Prince of Wales (later King George II) , Lady Mary is today chiefly remembered for her letters, particularly her &quot;Turkish Embassy Letters&quot; describing her travels to the Ottoman Empire, as wife to the British ambassador to Turkey, which Billie Melman describes as &quot;the very first example of a secular work by a woman about the Muslim Orient&quot;. Aside from her writing, Mary is also known for introducing and advocating smallpox inoculation in Britain after her return from Turkey. Her writings address and challenge some contemporary social attitudes towards women and their intellectual and social growth at that time.

==Early life==
Lady Mary Pierrepont was born on 15 May 1689 at Holme Pierrepont Hall in Nottinghamshire, and baptised on 26 May 1689 at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Covent Garden, London. She was the eldest child of Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull (c.1655‚Äì1726), and his first wife Lady Mary Feilding (died 20 December 1697), the only daughter of the third Earl of Denbigh (1640‚Äì1685). Lady Mary had three younger siblings: two girls, Frances and Evelyn, and a boy, William.

Lady Mary was a bright, free-spirited child who dreamed of greatness. She wrote in her diary, &quot;I am going to write a history so uncommon.&quot; Members of the newly formed Kit-Cat Club, a group of fashionable men, nominated her when she was seven years old, as the subject of their toast to the beauty of the season, and they had her name engraved on the glass goblet used for this purpose. As a child, she had a &quot;desire of catching the setting sun&quot; and she would run across the meadow to &quot;catch hold of the great golden ball of fire sinking on the horizon&quot;. However, she then realized that this activity &quot;was impossible&quot;. Overall, the pursuit of achieving the impossible became a recurring pattern throughout her life.

However, misfortune occurred ‚Äì her mother, who she thought would have supported her aspirations, died. Then her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Pierrepont, raised Mary and her siblings until she died when Mary was eight years old. After Mrs Pierrepont&#x27;s death, Mary was passed to the care of her father, who did not believe he was obliged to assist with her education.

==Education==
Mary Wortley Montagu&#x27;s education was divided between a governess and the use of the library at the family property Thoresby Hall. According to Lady Mary, the governess gave her &quot;one of the worst [educations] in the world&quot; by teaching Lady Mary &quot;superstitious tales and false notions&quot;. To supplement the instruction of a despised governess, Lady Mary used the well-furnished library to &quot;steal&quot; her education by hiding in the library, between 10am and 2pm, and &quot;every afternoon from four to eight&quot;. She taught herself Latin, a language usually reserved for men at the time. She secretly got a hold of a &quot;Latin dictionary and grammar&quot; and by the age of thirteen, her handling with the language was on par to most men. Furthermore, she was also a voracious reader. She jotted the list of characters and titles she read into a notebook. Some of the works she read included &quot;plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, Dryden, Rowe, Lee, Otway&quot; and French and English romances, including &quot;&quot;Grand Cyrus&quot;, &quot;Pharamond&quot;, &quot;Almahide&quot;, and &quot;Parthenissa&quot;.&quot; By 1705, at the age of fourteen or fifteen, Mary Pierrepont had written two albums entitled &quot;Poems, Songs &amp;c&quot; filled with poetry, a brief epistolary novel, and a prose-and-verse romance modelled after Aphra Behn&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to the Isle of Love&quot; (1684). She also corresponded with two bishops, Thomas Tenison and Gilbert Burnet, who supplemented the instruction of the governess. Overall, Mary impressed her father, who was not a scholar, with her progress.

== Marriage and embassy to Ottoman Empire ==

=== Engagement ===

By 1710, Lady Mary had two possible suitors to choose from: Edward Wortley Montagu (born 8 February 1678) and Clotworthy Skeffington. The friendship between Lady Mary and Edward Wortley Montagu, the son of Sidney Wortley Montagu, began through Edward&#x27;s younger sister Anne Wortley. In London, Anne and Lady Mary met frequently at social functions and exchanged visits to each other&#x27;s homes. They also communicated through writing, in which they filled their letters with &quot;trivial gossip&quot; and &quot;effusive compliments&quot;. After Anne died in November 1709, Lady Mary began conversing with Anne&#x27;s brother Edward Wortley Montagu. Lady Mary often met Edward at &quot;friends&#x27; houses&quot; and &quot;at Court&quot;. On 28 March 1710, she wrote the first letter she addressed to Edward. Lady Mary corresponded with Edward Wortley Montagu via letters until 2 May 1711 without her father&#x27;s permission.

Keeping up with their communication became harder when Lady Mary&#x27;s father bought a house at Acton, a suburban village famous for its mineral springs. Lady Mary hated the house because it was &#x27;dull and disagreeable,&#x27; and it did not have a library in it. A few weeks after moving, Lady Mary had the measles, and she asked her maid to write Edward a letter to tell him about the illness. Soon, there were misunderstandings between Edward and Lady Mary. Edward hurried to Acton. There, he left a note, revealing his love: &quot;I should be overjoyed to hear your Beauty is very much impaired, could I be pleased with anything that would give you displeasure, for it would lessen the number of Admirers.&quot; In response, she scolded his indiscretion by saying, &quot;Forgive and forget me.&quot; Then, in his reply, Edward stated that &quot;he would deal with her father if he were sure they could be happy together.&quot; This reply helped Lady Mary forget her irritation. Lady Mary in Acton and Edward in London kept writing to each other until the early summer of 1710.

Lady Mary&#x27;s primary concern with her engagement was financial, not romantic. Lady Mary denied transient emotions guiding her life: &quot;I can esteem, I can be a friend, but I don&#x27;t know whether I can love.&quot; Then, after setting forth all her terms, including her deference, she warned to Edward that &quot;Make no answer to this, if you can like me on my own terms&quot; and that his proposals not be made for her. However, these correspondences soon endangered Edward. In one particular letter, Edward wrote, &quot;Her being better in 1710, the consequence of its being known that I write to her.&quot; A servant in Lady Mary&#x27;s household found this letter and gave it to her father; this letter put her father &quot;in the utmost rage.&quot; However, Wortley was flattered that Lady Mary &quot;had given the father as &#x27;an artifice to bring the affair to a proper conclusion.&#x27;&quot; The next day, Wortley called Lady Mary&#x27;s father about a formal proposal. Mary&#x27;s father, now Marquess of Dorchester had insisted on one condition in the marriage contract: &quot;that Wortley&#x27;s estate be entailed on the first son born to him.&quot; However, Wortley refused to do this as it would require ¬£10,000.

Consequently, in order to convince Lady Mary&#x27;s father, Edward thought of publishing the marriage contract in the &quot;Tatler&quot;, a British journal. On the &quot;Tatler&quot;‚Ä≥s issue of 18 July, Wortley wrote the following: &quot;Her first lover has ten to one against him. The very hour after he has opened his heart and his rent rolls he is made no other use of but to raise her price...While the poor lover very innocently waits, till the plenipotentiaries at the inns of court have debated about the alliance, all the partisans of the lady throw difficulties in the way, till other offers come in; and the man who came first is not put in possession, until she has been refused by half the town.&quot; These arguments did not persuade Lord Dorchester. Even though these negotiations reached an impasse, Lady Mary and Edward continued corresponding with one another.

At the end of March 1711, Lady Mary&#x27;s father &#x27;determined to end her friendship with Wortley&#x27;. Her father summoned her to a conference, forced her to promise to not to write, and hustled her to West Dean, Wiltshire. However, Lady Mary broke her promise to tell Wortley about her rights and duty: &quot;Had you had any real Affection for me, you would have long go applied yourself to him, from whose hand only you can receive me.&quot; After their exchanges of disagreements and realizing she did not like him, he realized their friendship must end. On 2 May, he replied, &quot;Adieu, Dearest L[ady] M[ary]. This once be assur&#x27;d you will not deceive me. I expect no answer.&quot; Consequently, Lady Mary did not respond that summer. In that same summer, her father Lord Dorchester decided to find a husband other than Edward Wortley Montagu for his daughter.

Lady Mary&#x27;s father pressured her to marry Clotworthy Skeffington, the heir to the Irish Viscount Massereene. Skeffington&#x27;s marriage contract included &quot;an allowance of ¬£500 a year as &#x27;pin-money,&#x27; and ¬£1,200 a year if he died.&quot; However, she rejected him. Thus, to avoid marriage to Skeffington, she eloped with Montagu. In a letter to Wortley, she wrote, &quot;He [my father] will have a thousand plausible reasons for being irreconcilable, and &#x27;tis very probable the world will be on his side...I shall come to you with only a night-gown and petticoat, and that is all you will get with me. I told a lady of my friends what I intended to do. You will think her a very good friend when I tell you she has proffered to lend us her house if we would come there the first night...If you determine to go to that lady&#x27;s house, you had better come with a coach and six at seven o&#x27;clock to-morrow.&quot; The marriage license is dated 17 August 1712, and the marriage probably took place on 23 August 1712.

=== Early married life before travelling to the Ottoman Empire ===
Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Edward Wortley Montagu spent the first years of their married life in England. She had a son, Edward Wortley Montagu the younger, named after his father Edward Wortley Montagu, on 16 May 1713, in London. On 13 October 1714, her husband accepted the post of Junior Commissioner of the Treasury. When Lady Mary joined him in London, her wit and beauty soon made her a prominent figure at court. She was among the society of George I and George Augustus, Prince of Wales, and counted amongst her friends Molly Skerritt, Lady Walpole, John, Lord Hervey, Mary Astell, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, Alexander Pope, John Gay, and Abb√© Antonio Schinella Conti.

In December 1715, at the age of twenty-six, Lady Mary contracted smallpox. She survived, but while she was ill someone circulated the satirical &quot;court eclogues&quot; she had been writing. One of the poems was read as an attack on Caroline, Princess of Wales, in spite of the fact that the &quot;attack&quot; was voiced by a character who was herself heavily satirised.

=== Husband&#x27;s assignment to Constantinople ===
In 1716, Edward Wortley Montagu was appointed Ambassador at Constantinople to negotiate an end to the Austro-Turkish War. In August 1716, Lady Mary accompanied him to Vienna, and thence to Adrianople and Constantinople. He was recalled in 1717, but they remained at Constantinople until 1718. While away from England, the Wortley Montagus had a daughter on 19 January 1718, who would grow up to be Mary, Countess of Bute. After an unsuccessful delegation between Austria and the Ottoman Empire, they set sail for England via the Mediterranean, and reached London on 2 October 1718. In the same year, the Austrians and Turkish signed the Treaty of Passarowitz at the conclusion of the Austro-Turkish War.

The story of this voyage and of her observations of Eastern life is told in &quot;Letters from Turkey&quot;, a series of lively letters full of graphic descriptions; &quot;Letters&quot; is often credited as being an inspiration for subsequent female travelers and writers, as well as for much Orientalist art. During her visit she was sincerely charmed by the beauty and hospitality of the Ottoman women she encountered. In letters she wrote about how different fashion was as she made her way to Turkey. In a letter to Lady Mar, from Vienna, she wrote: &quot;They build certain fabrics of gauze on their heads, about a yard high, consisting of three or four stories, fortified with numberless yards of heavy ribbon...Their whalebone petticoats outdo ours by several yards&#x27; circumference, and cover some acres of ground.&quot; Furthermore, she recorded her experiences in a Turkish bath, which are reserved for both diversion and health. In a letter, she wrote, &quot;They [Ottoman women] generally take this diversion once a week, and stay there at least four or five hours, without getting cold immediately coming out of the hot bath into the cold room, which was surprising to me.&quot; She also recorded a particularly amusing incident in which a group of Turkish women at a bath in Sofia, horrified by the sight of the stays she was wearing, exclaimed that &quot;they believed I was so locked up in that machine that it was not in my own power to open it, which contrivance they attributed to my husband.&quot; Lady Mary wrote about the misconceptions that previous travelers, specifically male travelers, had recorded about the religion, traditions and the treatment of women in the Ottoman Empire. Her gender and class status provided her with access to female spaces that were closed off to males. Her personal interactions with Ottoman women enabled her to provide, in her view, a more accurate account of Turkish women, their dress, habits, traditions, limitations and liberties, at times irrefutably more a critique of the Occident than a praise of the Orient. Montagu also carefully constructed Ottoman female spaces, and her own engagement with Ottoman women, as full of homoerotic desire, which is consistent with the gender and sexual fluidity that characterized much of her life and writings.

== Ottoman smallpox inoculation ==
=== Smallpox inoculation ===
In the 18th century, Europeans began an experiment known as &quot;inoculation or variolation&quot; to prevent, not cure the smallpox. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu defied convention, most memorably by promoting smallpox inoculation to Western medicine after witnessing it during her travels and stay in the Ottoman Empire. Previously, Lady Mary&#x27;s brother had died of smallpox in 1713, and although Lady Mary recovered from the disease in 1715, it left her with a disfigured face. In the Ottoman Empire, she visited the women in their segregated zenanas, a house for Muslims and Hindus, making friends and learning about Turkish customs. There in March 1717, she witnessed the practice of inoculation against smallpox ‚Äì variolation ‚Äì which she called engrafting, and wrote home about it in a number of her letters. The most famous of these letters was her &quot;Letter to a Friend&quot; of 1 April 1717. Variolation used live smallpox virus in the pus taken from a mild smallpox blister and introduced it into scratched skin of the arm or leg (the most usual spots) of a previously uninfected person to promote immunity to the disease. Consequently, the inoculate would develop a milder case of smallpox than the one he/she might have contracted.

Lady Mary was eager to spare her children, thus, in March 1718 she had her nearly five-year-old son, Edward, inoculated there with the help of Embassy surgeon Charles Maitland. In fact, her son was the &quot;first English person to undergo the operation.&quot; In a letter to a friend in England, Montagu wrote, &quot;There is a set of old women [here], who make it their business to perform the operation, every autumn...when then great heat is abated...thousands undergo this operation...[and there] is not one example of anyone that has died in it.&quot; Afterwards, she updated the status of Edward to her husband: &quot;The Boy was engrafted last Tuesday, and is at this time singing and playing, and very impatient for his supper. I pray God my next may give as good an account of him.&quot; On her return to London, she enthusiastically promoted the procedure, but encountered a great deal of resistance from the medical establishment, because it was a folk treatment process.

In April 1721, when a smallpox epidemic struck England, she had her daughter inoculated by Maitland, the same physician who had inoculated her son at the Embassy in Turkey, and publicised the event. This was the first such operation done in England. She persuaded Caroline of Ansbach, the Princess of Wales, to test the treatment. In August 1721, seven prisoners at Newgate Prison awaiting execution were offered the chance to undergo variolation instead of execution: they all survived and were released. Despite this, controversy over smallpox inoculation intensified. However Caroline, Princess of Wales, was convinced of its value. The Princess&#x27;s two daughters Amelia and Caroline were successfully inoculated in April 1722 by French-born surgeon Claudius Amyand. In response to the general fear of inoculation, Lady Mary, under a pseudonym, wrote and published an article describing and advocating in favour of inoculation in September 1722. Later, other royal families soon followed Montagu&#x27;s act. For instance, in 1768, Catherine the Great of Russia had herself and her son, the future Tsar Paul, inoculated. The Russians continued to refine the process.

Nevertheless, inoculation was not always a safe process; inoculates developed a real case of smallpox and could infect others. The inoculation resulted in a &quot;small number of deaths and complications, including serious infections.&quot; Subsequently, Edward Jenner, who was 13 years old when Lady Mary died in 1762, developed the much safer technique of vaccination using cowpox instead of smallpox. Jenner&#x27;s method involves &quot;engrafting lymph taken from a pustulate of cowpox on the hand of a milkmaid into the arm of an inoculate.&quot; Jenner first tested his method on James Phipps, an eight-year-old boy, and when Phipps did not have any reaction after the procedure, Jenner claimed that his procedure &quot;bestowed immunity against smallpox.&quot; Then, after spending the next few years experimenting his new procedure, he discovered that his hypothesis was correct. As vaccination gained acceptance, variolation gradually fell out of favour. In the 20th century, a concerted campaign by the WHO to eradicate smallpox via vaccination would succeed by 1979. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu&#x27;s introduction of smallpox inoculation had ultimately led to the development of vaccines, and the later eradication of smallpox.

== Later years ==
After returning to England, Lady Mary took less interest in court compared to her earlier years. Instead, she was more focused on the upbringing of her children, reading, writing, and editing her travel letters‚Äîwhich she then chose not to publish.

Before starting for the East, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had met Alexander Pope, and during her Embassy travels with her husband, they wrote each other a series of letters. While Pope may have been fascinated by her wit and elegance, Lady Mary&#x27;s replies to his letters reveal that she was not equally smitten. Very few letters passed between them after Lady Mary&#x27;s return to England, and various reasons have been suggested for the subsequent estrangement. In 1728, Pope attacked Lady Mary in his &quot;Dunciad&quot;, which inaugurated a decade in which most of his publications made some sort of allegation against her.

===Difficulties with family===
Lady Mary went through a series of trials with her children. In 1726 and 1727, Lady Mary&#x27;s son Edward ran away from Westminster School several times. He was then entrusted to a tutor with strict orders to keep him abroad. In later years, her son managed to return to England without permission and continued to have a strained relationship with both his parents.

In the summer of 1736, Lady Mary&#x27;s daughter, also named Mary, fell in love with John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, but he had little fortune; Lady Mary warned her daughter about the disadvantages of living in poverty. Lady Mary similarly had concerns regarding the 1734 marriage of her niece Lady Mary Pierrrepont (1711-1795) who had eloped with Philip Meadows, Deputy Ranger of Richmond Park saying that her &quot;ruin&quot; was due to the &quot;silly good people that had the care of her&quot;.

In August 1736, Lady Mary&#x27;s daughter married Bute, despite her parents&#x27; disapproval of the match. Later, Lady Mary wrote to Lord Gower, 1st Earl Gower, about her daughter&#x27;s disobedience. In response, Lord Gower tried to console Lady Mary: &quot;I hope by her future conducts she will atone for her past, and that choice will prove more happy than you and Mr. Wortley expect.&quot;

In the same year, Lady Mary met and fell in love with Count Francesco Algarotti, who competed with an equally smitten John Hervey for her affections.

Lady Mary wrote many letters to Francesco Algarotti in English and in French after his departure from England in September 1736. In July 1739, Lady Mary departed England without her husband ostensibly for health reasons, possibly from a disfiguring skin disease, and declared her intentions to winter in the south of France; after she left England, she and her husband never met again. In reality, she left to visit and live with Algarotti in Venice. Their relationship ended in 1741 after Lady Mary and Algarotti were both on a diplomatic mission in Turin. Lady Mary stayed abroad and travelled extensively. After travelling to Venice, Florence, Rome, Genoa and Geneva, she finally settled in Avignon in 1742. She left Avignon in 1746 for Brescia, where she fell ill and stayed for nearly a decade, leaving for Lovere in 1754. In the summer of 1756, Lady Mary travelled to Venice for an undisclosed business errand. After August 1756, she resided in Venice and Padua and saw Algarotti again in November. Throughout the time, Lady Mary exchanged letters with her daughter, Lady Bute, discussing topics such as philosophy, literature, and the education of girls, as well as conveying details of her geographical and social surroundings.

Lady Mary received news of her husband Edward Wortley Montagu&#x27;s death on 1 January 1761, and he was buried at Wortley. As soon as she learned of her husband&#x27;s death, Lady Mary left Venice for England. She had a self-imposed exile because of her strained relationship with her husband, but her return made sense because she wanted to see her daughter and her grandchildren before she died. On 1 September 1761, she began her journey back home; she decided to go through Germany and Holland because France, which was deemed the easier route, was at war. However, the journey was dangerous and exhausting. When she reached Augsburg on 1 October, she wrote to Sir James and Lady Francis Steuart that &quot;she hoped to meet them in Holland.&quot; She recorded her perils and fatigues to Sir James in a letter: &quot;I am dragging my ragged remnant of life to England. The wind and the tide are against me; how far I have strength to struggle against both, I know not.&quot; While detained at Rotterdam, she handed her &quot;Embassy Letters&quot; to the Reverend Benjamin Sowden of Rotterdam, for safe keeping and &quot;to be dispos&#x27;d of as he thinks proper.&quot; After she left Rotterdam on 12 December, a hard, impenetrable frost hindered her voyage. Towards the end of the month, she sailed for England, but a mountainous sea obstructed the passage and the captain returned to harbor. On the next attempt a few days later, Lady Mary reached London in January 1762. After arriving in London, Lady Mary rented a house in Great George Street, Hanover Square, and her daughter and grandchildren often visited her.

In June 1762, it became known that Lady Mary was suffering from cancer. Even though she tried to conceal her illness from her family as long as possible, she grew rapidly weaker that month. She wrote her last letter but with difficulty on 2 July to Lady Frances Steuart; in this letter, she wrote &quot;I have been ill a long time, and am now so bad I am little capable of writing, but I would not pass in your opinion as either stupid or ungrateful. My heart is always warm in your service, and I am always told your affairs shall be taken care of.&quot; Lady Frances&#x27;s son was in London, and when he visited Lady Mary&#x27;s house, he was summoned to her bedroom where he was surrounded by her relatives, including Lord and Lady Bute. Lady Mary then ordered her relatives to leave the room, saying of Lady Frances&#x27;s son, &quot;My dear young friend has come to see me before I die, and I desire to be left alone with him.&quot; She died on 21 August 1762 at her house in Great George Street, and was buried in Grosvenor Chapel the day after she died.

== Important works and literary place ==
Although Lady Mary Wortley Montagu is now best known for her &quot;Turkish Embassy Letters&quot;, she wrote poetry and essays as well. A number of Lady Mary&#x27;s poems and essays were printed in her lifetime, either without or with her permission, in newspapers, in miscellanies, and independently.

Montagu did not intend to publish her poetry, but it did circulate widely, in manuscript, among members of her own social circle. Lady Mary was highly suspicious of any idealizing literary language. She wrote most often in heroic couplets, a serious poetic form to employ, and, according to Susan Staves, &quot;excelled at answer poems&quot;. Some of her widely anthologized poems include &quot;Constantinople&quot; and &quot;Epistle from Mrs. Yonge to her Husband&quot;. &quot;Constantinople&quot;, written in January 1718, is a beautiful poem in heroic couplets describing Britain and Turkey through human history, and representing the states of mind &quot;of knaves, coxcombs, the mob, and party zealous‚Äîall characteristic of the London of her time&quot;. &quot;Epistle from Mrs. Yonge to her Husband&quot;, written in 1724, stages a letter from Mrs. Yonge to her libertine husband and exposes the social double standard which led to the shaming and distress of Mrs. Yonge after her divorce. In 1737 and 1738, Lady Mary published anonymously a political periodical called the &quot;Nonsense of Common-Sense&quot;, supporting the Robert Walpole government. The title was a reference to a journal of the liberal opposition entitled &quot;Common Sense&quot;. She wrote six Town Eclogues and other poems.

===&quot;The Turkish Embassy Letters&quot;===

Lady Mary wrote notable letters describing her travels through Europe and the Ottoman Empire; these appeared after her death in three volumes. Although not published during her lifetime, her letters from Turkey were clearly intended for print. She revised them extensively and gave a transcript to the Reverend Benjamin Sowden, a British clergyman, in Rotterdam in 1761. Sowden also lent the book to two English travelers, including Thomas Becket. Furthermore, during that night, the travelers made copies of her letters. After the travelers returned the book, Sowden handed the book to Lady Mary&#x27;s son-in-law, Lord Bute (later Prime Minister), in exchange for ¬£200 ().

In 1763 in London, the year after her death, Becket and De Hondt published this error-laden version manuscript in three volumes, entitled &quot;Letters of the Right Honourable Lady My W‚Äîy M----e: Written, during her Travels in Europe, Asia and Africa, to Persons of Distinction, Men of Letters, &amp;c. in different Parts of Europe; Which contain, Among other curious Relations, Accounts of the Policy and Manners of the Turks&quot;, commonly referred to as the &quot;Embassy Letters&quot; or &quot;Turkish Embassy Letters&quot; because it was &quot;composed during and after Montagu&#x27;s journey through Europe to Constantinople in the company of her husband&quot;.&quot;&quot; The first edition of the book sold out; in fact, the &quot;Critical Review&quot; newspaper editor, Tobias Smollett, wrote that the letters were &quot;never equaled by any letter-writer of any sex, age or nation&quot; and Voltaire also had high praise of these letters. Four years later in 1767, editor John Cleland added five spurious letters, along with previous printed essays and verses, to the previous edition of the book.

Despite the immediate success following the publication of &quot;Turkish Embassy Letters&quot;, Lady Mary&#x27;s daughter, Mary Stuart, Countess of Bute, was furious and worried about how an unauthorized publication would impact the family&#x27;s reputation. One of the manuscript volumes that others found was Lady Mary&#x27;s famous diary, and Lady Bute did not have any knowledge of this existence until a few days before her mother&#x27;s death. After she received these volumes, Lady Bute &quot;kept it always under lock and key, and though she often looked over it herself, and read passages aloud to her daughters and friends, excepting the first five or six copy-books, which at a late period, she permitted Lady Louisa Stuart to peruse alone, upon condition that nothing should be transcribed.&quot; Lady Louisa, the youngest of Lady Bute&#x27;s daughters, was scolded for reading books and wanting to be like her grandmother. Later, Lady Louisa followed her grandmother&#x27;s footsteps and became a writer. Then when Lady Bute felt that the end of her life was near, in 1794, she burnt the diary that her mother kept since her marriage. She chose to burn the diary because Lady Bute always spoke to her mother with great respect, and she feared the possibility of a scandal.

According to O&#x27;Quinn, although &quot;The Turkish Embassy Letters&quot; has been considered one of the best literary works published in the eighteenth century, the work has not been as appreciated as those published by her male peers, such as Alexander Pope and Horace Walpole. She was the &quot;target of vicious attacks&quot; from printing presses and male peers. Although she describes her travels through Europe to the Ottoman Empire in &quot;The Turkish Embassy Letters&quot; to her correspondents, very few of the letters survived, and the letters in the book may not be accurate transcriptions of the actual correspondence. According to Daniel O&#x27;Quinn, the book was not a culmination of facts but of opinions, and there must be some filtering during the editing processes. Furthermore, to avoid public censure, Montagu used pseudonyms, such as &quot;a Turkey merchant&quot; and &quot;Lady President&quot;, in her publications. Lastly, Montagu&#x27;s &quot;The Turkish Embassy Letters&quot; was published posthumously ‚Äî Walpole affirmed that it was Montagu&#x27;s deathbed wish to get the letters published.

An important early letter was published, probably without Montagu&#x27;s consent, titled &quot;The Genuine Copy of a Letter Written From Constantinople by an English Lady&quot; in 1719. Both in this letter and in the &quot;Turkish Embassy Letters&quot; more broadly, particularly in the letters about her host, the scholar Achmet Beg, Montagu participates in a wider English dialogue on Enlightenment ideas about religion, particularly deism, and their overlap with Islamic theology. Montagu, along with many others, including the freethinking scholar Henry Stubbe, celebrated Islam for what they saw as its rational approach to theology, for its strict monotheism, and for its teaching and practice around religious tolerance. In short, Montagu and other thinkers in this tradition saw Islam as a source of Enlightenment, as evidenced in her calling the Qur&#x27;an &quot;the purest morality delivered in the very best language&quot; By comparison, Montagu dedicated large portions of the &quot;Turkish Embassy Letters&quot; to criticizing Catholic religious practices, particularly Catholic beliefs around sainthood, miracles, and religious relics, which she frequently excoriated. In relation to these practices, she wrote, &quot;I cannot fancy there is anything new in letting you know that priests can lie, and the mob believe all over the world.&quot;

Montagu&#x27;s Turkish letters were to prove an inspiration to later generations of European women travellers and writers. In particular, Montagu staked a claim to the authority of women&#x27;s writing, due to their ability to access private homes and female-only spaces where men were not permitted. The title of her published letters is &quot;Sources that Have Been Inaccessible to Other Travellers&quot;. The letters themselves frequently draw attention to the fact that they present a different, and Montagu asserts more accurate description than that provided by previous (male) travellers: &quot;You will perhaps be surpriz&#x27;d at an Account so different from what you have been entertained with by the common Voyage-writers who are very fond of speaking of what they don&#x27;t know.&quot; In general, Montagu dismisses the quality of European travel literature of the 18th century as nothing more than &quot;trite observations...superficial...[of] boys [who] only remember where they met with the best wine or the prettiest women&quot;. Montagu writes about the &quot;warmth and civility&quot; of Ottoman women. She describes the &quot;hammam&quot;, known to her readers as a &#x27;Turkish bath&#x27;, &quot;as a space of urbane homosociality, free of cruel satire and disdain&quot;. She mentions that &quot;&quot;hammam&quot; are remarkable for their undisguised admiration of the women&#x27;s beauty and demeanor&quot;, which creates a space for female authority. Montagu provides an intimate description of the women&#x27;s bathhouse in Sofia, in which she derides male descriptions of the bathhouse as a site for unnatural sexual practices, instead insisting that it was &quot;the Women&#x27;s coffee house, where all the news of the Town is told, Scandal invented, etc.&quot; Montagu&#x27;s reference to &quot;women&#x27;s coffee house&quot; represents the political and social freedom that women had access to in the Ottoman Empire during the 18th century. Even though Montagu refused to undress for the bath at first, the girls managed to persuade her to &quot;open my shirt, and show them my stays, which satisfied them very well&quot;. In one letter to her sister Lady Mar, she wrote, &quot;nothing will surprise you more than the sight of my person, as I am now in my Turkish habit.&quot;

During Montagu&#x27;s time in the Ottoman Empire, she saw and wrote extensively concerning the practise of slavery along with the treatment of slaves by the Turks. Montagu wrote many letters with positive descriptions of the various enslaved people that she saw in the elite circles of Istanbul, including eunuchs and large collections of serving and dancing girls dressed in expensive outfits. In one of her letters written back home, famously from the interior of a bath house, she dismisses the idea that slaves of the Ottoman elite should be figures to be pitied. In response to her visit to the slave market in Istanbul, she wrote &quot;you will imagine me half a Turk when I don&#x27;t speak of it with the same horror other Christians have done before me, but I cannot forbear applauding the humanity of the Turks to those creatures. They are never ill-used, and their slavery is in my opinion no worse than servitude all over the world.&quot;


Montagu&#x27;s Turkish letters were frequently cited by Western female travellers, more than a century after her journey. Such writers cited Montagu&#x27;s assertion that women travellers could gain an intimate view of Turkish life that was not available to their male counterparts. However, they also added corrections or elaborations to her observations.

===Other works and legacy===
In 1739, a book was printed by an unknown author under the pseudonym &quot;Sophia, a person of quality&quot;, titled &quot;Woman not Inferior to Man&quot;. This book is often attributed to Lady Mary.

Her &quot;Letters and Works&quot; were published in 1837. Montagu&#x27;s octogenarian granddaughter Lady Louisa Stuart contributed to this, anonymously, an introductory essay titled &quot;Biographical Anecdotes of Lady M. W. Montagu&quot;, from which it was clear that Stuart was troubled by her grandmother&#x27;s focus on sexual intrigues and did not see Lady Mary Wortley Montagu&#x27;s &quot;Account of the Court of George I at his Accession&quot; as history. However, Montagu&#x27;s historical observations, both in the &quot;Anecdotes&quot; and the &quot;Turkish Embassy Letters&quot;, prove quite accurate when put in context.

During the twentieth century, Lady Mary&#x27;s letters were edited separately from her essays, poems and plays. Lady Mary corresponded with Anne Wortley and wrote courtship letters to her future husband Edward Wortley Montagu, as well as love letters to Francesco Algarotti. She corresponded with notable writers, intellectuals and aristocrats of her day. She wrote gossip letters and letters berating the vagaries of fashionable people to her sister Frances, Countess of Mar, the wife of the Jacobite Earl of Mar. They met when the Wortleys visited Paris on 29 September 1718. During her visit, Montagu observed the beauties and behaviors of Parisian women. She wrote &quot;their hair cut short and curled round their faces, loaded with powder that makes it look like white wool!&quot; In one of their correspondences, Lady Mary informed her sister of the &#x27;surprising death&#x27; of her father. Furthermore, they exchanged intellectual letters with Montagu&#x27;s daughter, Mary, Lady Bute. Lady Mary and Lady Mar discontinued their correspondence in 1727.

Despite the availability of her work in print and the revival efforts of feminist scholars, the complexity and brilliance of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu&#x27;s extensive body of work has not yet been recognized to the fullest.

<text>Edward Wortley Montagu (15 May 1713 ‚Äì 29 April 1776) was an English author and traveller.

He was the son of the diplomat and member of parliament Edward Wortley Montagu and the writer and traveller Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, whose talent and eccentricity he seems to have inherited. In 1716, he was taken by his parents to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, and at Pera in March 1716-17 was inoculated for smallpox, the first native of the United Kingdom to undergo this medical procedure.

On the return of his parents to England in 1718, he was placed at Westminster School, from which he ran away more than once. On the first occasion, in July 1726, he was traced to Oxford, and was with difficulty &#x27;reduced to the humble condition of a school-boy.&#x27; He decamped again in August 1727 and was not recovered for some months. Two similar escapades are mentioned by his tutor, Forster, chaplain to the Duchess of Kingston, but without dates. The first ended in his discovery, after a year&#x27;s absence, selling fish in Blackwall. The second time, he worked his passage out to Oporto, deserted, went up country, and found employment in the vineyards, but returning to Oporto in charge of some asses, he was arrested at the instance of the British consul, brought back to his ship, identified and restored to his parents by the master.

He was then sent to travel with a tutor in the West Indies, and afterwards with a keeper to the Netherlands. He made a serious study of Arabic at Leiden in 1741 and returned many years later to prosecute his studies. His father made him a meagre allowance, and he was heavily encumbered with debt.

He served in the British army from 1743 to 1748, first as a cornet in the 7th Dragoon Guards and later as a captain-lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of Foot. He fought at the Battle of Fontenoy. He left the army in 1748. He thereafter traveled in various parts for many years, writing brief diary notes of his travels along with occasional sketches; and finally returned to his studies in 1769.
He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdonshire in 1747 and was one of the secretaries at the conference of Aix-la-Chapelle that closed the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748. In 1751, he was involved in a disreputable gaming quarrel in Paris; arrested for cheating a Jew at cards and then robbing him when he refused to pay; and was imprisoned for eleven days in the Ch√¢telet. He was cleared after the first court hearing before the decision was overturned by the Parlement of Paris, and he was ordered to pay a fine of 300 livres. He continued to sit in parliament, and wrote &quot;Reflections on the Rise and Fall of the Antient Republics ...&quot; (1759). Whilst in Italy, he designed and published a detailed map of the Ambracian Gulf and the island of Lefkas in northwestern Greece. His father left him an annuity of ¬£1000, the bulk of the property going to his sister Lady Bute.

He set out for extended travel in the East, and George Romney described him as living in the Turkish manner at Venice. Fluent in Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldaic, and Persian, he was also an excellent orator. His family thought him mad, and his mother left him a single guinea in her will, but her annuity devolved on him at her death. He died at Padua in Italy.

<text>In cardiovascular physiology, stroke volume (SV) is the volume of blood pumped from the ventricle per beat. Stroke volume is calculated using measurements of ventricle volumes from an echocardiogram and subtracting the volume of the blood in the ventricle at the end of a beat (called end-systolic volume) from the volume of blood just prior to the beat (called end-diastolic volume). The term &quot;stroke volume&quot; can apply to each of the two ventricles of the heart, although when not explicitly stated it refers to the left ventricle and should therefore be referred to as left stroke volume (LSV). The stroke volumes for each ventricle are generally equal, both being approximately 90 mL in a healthy 70-kg man. Any persistent difference between the two stroke volumes, no matter how small, would inevitably lead to venous congestion of either the systemic or the pulmonary circulation, with a corresponding state of hypotension in the other circulatory system. A shunt (see patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect) between the two systems will ensue if possible to reestablish the equilibrium.

Stroke volume is an important determinant of cardiac output, which is the product of stroke volume and heart rate, and is also used to calculate ejection fraction, which is stroke volume divided by end-diastolic volume. Because stroke volume decreases in certain conditions and disease states, stroke volume itself correlates with cardiac function.

==Calculation==
Its value is obtained by subtracting end-systolic volume (ESV) from end-diastolic volume (EDV) for a given ventricle.
:formula_1

In a healthy 70-kg man, ESV is approximately 50 mL and EDV is approximately 140mL, giving a difference of 90 mL for the stroke volume.

&quot;Stroke work&quot; refers to the work, or pressure of the blood (&quot;P&quot;) multiplied by the stroke volume.

==Determinants==

Men, on average, have higher stroke volumes than women due to the larger size of their hearts. However, stroke volume depends on several factors such as heart size, its force of contraction, duration of contraction, preload (end-diastolic volume), and afterload. Corresponding to the oxygen uptake, women&#x27;s need for blood flow does not decrease and a higher cardiac frequency makes up for their smaller stroke volume.

===Exercise===
Prolonged aerobic exercise training may also increase stroke volume, which frequently results in a lower (resting) heart rate. Reduced heart rate prolongs ventricular diastole (filling), increasing end-diastolic volume, and ultimately allowing more blood to be ejected.

===Preload and afterload===
Stroke volume is intrinsically controlled by preload (the degree to which the ventricles are stretched prior to contracting). An increase in the volume or speed of venous return will increase preload and, through the Frank‚ÄìStarling law of the heart, will increase stroke volume. Decreased venous return has the opposite effect, causing a reduction in stroke volume.

Elevated afterload (commonly measured as the aortic pressure during systole) reduces stroke volume. It usually does not affect stroke volume in healthy individuals, but increased afterload will hinder the ventricles in ejecting blood, causing reduced stroke volume. Increased afterload may be found in aortic stenosis and arterial hypertension.

===Stroke volume index===
Similar to cardiac index, stroke volume index is a method of relating the stroke volume (SV) to the person&#x27;s body surface area (BSA).

<text>Omer Victor Simeon (July 21, 1902 ‚Äì September 17, 1959) was an American jazz clarinetist. He also played soprano, alto, and baritone saxophone and bass clarinet.

==Biography==
The son of a cigar maker, Omer Simeon was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. His family moved to Chicago, Illinois. He learned clarinet from the New Orleans musician Lorenzo Tio, Jr. and started playing professionally in 1920.

He worked in Chicago and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with various bands, including Jimmy Bell&#x27;s Band and Charlie Elgar&#x27;s Creole Orchestra.

Starting in 1926, he began playing with Jelly Roll Morton, and made a well regarded series of recordings with Morton&#x27;s Red Hot Peppers and smaller groups. Simeon also taught music. In 1927, he joined King Oliver&#x27;s Dixie Syncopators with whom he moved to New York City. After time back in Chicago with Elgar, he joined the Luis Russell in Manhattan, then again returned to Chicago in 1928 to play with the Erskine Tate Orchestra. In 1931, he began a 10-year stint with Earl Hines.

In the 1940s, he worked in the bands of Coleman Hawkins and Jimmie Lunceford. After some recordings with Kid Ory&#x27;s band, he spent most of the 1950s with the Wilbur de Paris band, including a tour of Africa in 1957. In 1954, he played saxophone in a duet with Louis Armstrong on trumpet in Armstrong&#x27;s popular Dixieland recording of &quot;Skokiaan.&quot;

Omer Simeon died of throat cancer in New York City at the age of 57.

<doc id="400037" wikidata="Q561173" url="?curid=400037" title="John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury">
<text>John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, 1st Earl of Waterford, 7th Baron Talbot, KG (17 July 1453), known as &quot;Old Talbot&quot;, was an English nobleman and a noted military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. He was the most renowned in England and most feared in France of the English captains in the last stages of the conflict. Known as a tough, cruel, and quarrelsome man, Talbot distinguished himself militarily in a time of decline for the English. Called the &quot;English Achilles&quot; and the &quot;Terror of the French&quot;, he is lavishly praised in the plays of Shakespeare. The manner of his death, leading an ill-advised charge against field artillery, has come to symbolize the passing of the age of chivalry. He also held the subsidiary titles of 10th Baron Strange of Blackmere and 6th Baron Furnivall &quot;jure uxoris&quot;.

==Origins==
He was descended from Richard Talbot, the son of William &quot;Le Sire&quot; Talbot, whose estate (wife and infant son Hugh) was a tenant in 1086 of Walter Giffard at Woburn and Battlesden in Bedfordshire. The Talbot Family descends from William d&#x27;Hiemois, the illegitimate son of Richard I, Duke of Normandy. William&#x27;s son Hugh, Bishop of Lisieux, was the father of William &quot;Le Sire&quot; Talbot (1046‚Äì1066). The Talbots were cousins of William &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, King of England, and also the Giffard family. It is incorrect to suggest that the Talbot family were vassals of the Giffards in Normandy. Hugh Talbot, Richard&#x27;s son, made a grant to Beaubec Abbey, confirmed by his son Richard Talbot in 1153. This Richard (died 1175) is listed in 1166 as holding three fees of the Honour of Giffard in Buckinghamshire. He also held a fee at Linton in Herefordshire, for which his son Gilbert Talbot (died 1231) obtained a fresh charter in 1190. Gilbert&#x27;s grandson Gilbert (died 1274) married Gwenllian ferch Rhys Mechyll, who was incorrectly assumed to be the sole heiress of the Welsh Prince Rhys Mechyll, whose armorials were of the House of Deheubarth, and which the Talbots thenceforth assumed in lieu of their own former arms! Their son Sir Richard Talbot, who signed the Barons&#x27; Letter of 1301, held the manor of Eccleswall in Herefordshire in right of his wife Sarah, sister of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. In 1331 Richard&#x27;s son Gilbert Talbot (1276‚Äì1346) was summoned to Parliament, which is considered evidence of his baronial status ‚Äì see Baron Talbot. Gilbert&#x27;s son Richard married Elizabeth Comyn, bringing with her the inheritance of Goodrich Castle.

John Talbot was born in about 1384 or more likely around 1387, the second son of Richard Talbot, 4th Baron Talbot of Goodrich Castle, by Ankaret, daughter and sole heiress of the 4th Baron Strange of Blackmere. His birthplace was Black Mere Castle (the caput of his mother&#x27;s estates) near Whitchurch, Shropshire, which is now a scheduled monument listed as Blakemere Moat, site of the demolished fortified manor house. His younger brother Richard became Archbishop of Dublin and Lord Chancellor of Ireland: he was one of the most influential Irish statesmen of his time, and his brother&#x27;s most loyal supporter during his often troubled years in Ireland. John also had an elder brother, Gilbert (born 1383), who was heir to their parents&#x27; baronies of Talbot and Strange.

His father died in 1396 when Talbot was around nine years old, and so it was Ankaret&#x27;s second husband, Thomas Neville, 5th Baron Furnivall, who became the major influence in his early life. The marriage (1401) also gave the opportunity of a title for her second son, as Neville had no sons, with the title Baron Furnivall going through his eldest daughter Maud (Talbot&#x27;s stepsister), who would become John&#x27;s first wife. Their marriage resulted in John styling himself as John Talbot, 6th Baron Furnivall.

==Marriages and issue==
Talbot was married before 12 March 1407 to Maud Neville, 6th Baroness Furnivall, daughter and heiress of his stepfather Thomas Neville, 5th Baron Furnivall, the son of John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby. The couple are thought to have had six children: 
*John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury (c. 141310 July 1460)
*Thomas Talbot (19 June 1416, Finglas, Ireland10 August 1416)
*Lady Katherine Talbot (c. 1418c. 1500) married Sir Nicholas Eyton (c. 1405c. 1450), Sheriff of Shropshire 1440 &amp; 1449.
*Sir Christopher Talbot (141910 August 1443)
*Lady Joan Talbot (c. 1422), married James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley
*Lady Ann Talbot, married John Bottreaux, of Abbot&#x27;s Salford.

By the death of his niece in 1421 he acquired the Baronies of Talbot and Strange. His first wife, Maud, died on 31 May 1422. It has been suggested that she died as an indirect result of giving birth to her daughter Joan, although there is a lack of evidence about Joan&#x27;s life before her marriage to Lord Berkeley. There is even a theory that she was actually Talbot&#x27;s daughter-in-law through marriage to Sir Christopher Talbot.

On 6 September 1425, in the chapel at Warwick Castle, he married Lady Margaret Beauchamp, eldest daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick and Elizabeth de Berkeley. They had five children:
*John Talbot, 1st Baron Lisle and 1st Viscount Lisle, who was killed along with his father at Castillon on 17 July 1453.
*Sir Louis Talbot (c. 14291458) of Penyard
*Sir Humphrey Talbot (before 14341492, Mount Sinai), marshal of Calais. Married Mary, daughter and co-heiress of John Champernoun, no issue. Died probably at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery.
*Lady Eleanor Talbot (c. February/March 143630 June 1468) married to Sir Thomas Butler, and mistress or wife of King Edward IV.
*Lady Elizabeth Talbot (c. December 1442/January 14436 November 1506/10 May 1507). She married John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk.

Talbot is known to have had at least one illegitimate child, Henry. He may have served in France with his father as it is known that a bastard son of the Earl of Shrewsbury was captured by the Dauphin Louis on 14 August 1443.

==Early career and service in Ireland==
From 1404 to 1413 he served with his elder brother Gilbert in the Welsh revolt or the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr. Meanwhile, he was summoned to Parliament in his wife&#x27;s right from 1409. Then for five years from February 1414 he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, where he did some fighting. He had a dispute with James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond and Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn over the inheritance for the honour of Wexford which he held. Complaints were made against him both for his harsh government in Ireland and for acts of violence in Herefordshire, where he was a friend of the Lollard Sir John Oldcastle, and for land disputes with retainers of the Earl of Arundel.

The dispute with the Earl of Ormond escalated into a long-running feud between Talbot and his brother, the Archbishop of Dublin, on the one hand, and the Butler family and their allies the Berkeleys on the other. Relations between the two sides became so poisonous that it was said that real hatred was involved. The feud reached its height in the 1440s, and in the end just about every senior official in Ireland had taken sides in the quarrel. Both sides were reprimanded by the Privy Council for weakening English rule in Ireland: the Council implored them to make up their differences. Friendly relations were finally achieved by the marriage of Talbot&#x27;s son and heir to Ormond&#x27;s daughter, Lady Elizabeth Butler.

During John&#x27;s first term in Ireland, his elder brother Gilbert was serving as a soldier in France. Gilbert died on 19 October 1418 at the siege of Rouen, and his lands were inherited by his only daughter and heiress Ankaret Talbot, John&#x27;s niece. Ankaret, 6th Baroness Talbot, died shortly after on 13 December 1421 and the Talbot family lands were thus inherited by her uncle John, who became 7th Baron Talbot.

From 1420 to 1424 he served in France, apart from a brief return at the end of the first year to organise the festivities of celebrating the coronation of Catherine of Valois, the bride of Henry V. He returned to France in May 1421 and took part in the Battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424 earning him the Order of the Garter.

In 1425, he was lieutenant again for a short time in Ireland; he served again in 1446‚Äì47. On the latter appointment he was made Earl of Waterford and hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland.

==Service in France==
So far his career was that of a turbulent Marcher Lord, employed in posts where a rough hand was useful. It was for his actions in France that he would acquire his fame, however.

In 1427 he went again to France, where he fought alongside the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Warwick with distinction in Maine and at the Siege of Orl√©ans. He fought at the Battle of Patay on 18 June 1429 where he was captured and held prisoner for four years. He was released in exchange for the French leader Jean Poton de Xaintrailles and returned to England in May 1433. He stayed until July when he returned to France under the Earl of Somerset.

Talbot was a daring and aggressive soldier, perhaps the most audacious captain of the age. He and his forces were ever ready to retake a town and to meet a French advance. His trademark was rapid aggressive attacks. He was rewarded by being appointed governor and lieutenant general in France and Normandy and, in 1434, the Duke of Bedford made him Count of Clermont. He also reorganized the army with captains and lieutenants, trained the men for sieges, and equipped them accordingly. But when the Duke of Bedford died in 1435, the Burgundian government in Paris defected to the French, leaving Talbot, known as &quot;le roi talbot&quot; (&quot;king Talbot&quot;) as the main English general in the field.

On 2 February 1436, he led a small force including Sir Thomas Kyriell and Sir Thomas Scales and routed La Hire and Xaintrailles at the battle of Ry near Rouen. Later that year, he did much to recover large portions of land on the Pays de Caux in eastern Normandy which had been lost to the French a few months earlier. On the dawn of 13 February 1437, in spectacular fashion, he took the town of Pontoise north of Paris by surprise, threatening the capital itself for a time. The same year at Crotoy, after a daring passage of the Somme, he put a numerous Burgundian force to flight. At night on 22‚Äì23 December 1439, following a surprise flank attack on their camp, he dispersed the 6000-strong army of the Constable Richemont, and on 7 July 1440 he retook Harfleur. In 1441, he pursued the French army four times over the Seine and Oise rivers in an unavailing attempt to bring it to battle.

==Lord Shrewsbury==
Around February 1442, Talbot returned to England to request urgent reinforcements for the Duke of York in Normandy. In March, under king&#x27;s orders, ships were requisitioned for this purpose with Talbot himself responsible for assembling ships from the Port of London and from Sandwich.

On Whit Sunday, 20 May, Henry VI created him Earl of Shrewsbury. Just five days later, with the requested reinforcements, Talbot returned to France where in June they mustered at Harfleur. During that time, he met his six-year-old daughter Eleanor for the first time and almost certainly left the newly created Countess Margaret pregnant with another child.

In 1442‚Äì1443, he led the unsuccessful siege of Dieppe, where the English were beaten by a French relief force under the command of Louis, dauphin of France, the future king Louis XI.

In June 1443, Talbot again returned to England on behalf of the Duke of York to plead for reinforcements, but this time the English Council refused, instead sending a separate force under Shrewsbury&#x27;s brother-in-law, Edmund Beaufort. His son, Sir Christopher, stayed in England where shortly afterwards he was murdered with a lance at the age of 23 by one of his own men, Griffin Vachan of Treflidian on 10 August at &quot;Cawce, County Salop&quot; (Caus Castle).

==The English Achilles==
He was appointed in 1445 by Henry VI (as the disputed king of France) as Constable of France. Taken hostage at Rouen in 1449 he promised never to wear armour against the French King again. He was true to the letter of his word, but continued to command English forces against the French without personally fighting. In England, he was widely renowned as the best general King Henry VI had. The king relied upon his support at Dartford in 1452, and in 1450 to suppress Cade&#x27;s Revolt. In 1452 he was ordered to Bordeaux as the king&#x27;s lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine, and landed there on 17 October. He repaired castle garrisons facing mounting pressure from France, when some reinforcements arrived with his son John, Viscount Lisle in spring 1453, and he captured Fronsac.

==Death==
Talbot was decisively defeated and killed on 17 July 1453 at the Battle of Castillon near Bordeaux, which effectively ended English rule in Aquitaine, a principal cause of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. It was reported at the time that when his horse was fatally struck by enemy ordnance, it fell on top of Talbot and pinned him down, enabling a French soldier to finish him off with a battleaxe. His heart was buried in the doorway of St Alkmund&#x27;s Church, Whitchurch, Shropshire.

The victorious French generals raised a monument to Talbot on the field called Notre Dame de Talbot and a French Chronicler paid him handsome tribute:

&quot;Such was the end of this famous and renowned English leader who for so long had been one of the most formidable thorns in the side of the French, who regarded him with terror and dismay&quot; ‚Äì Matthew d&#x27;Escourcy

Although Talbot is generally remembered as a great soldier, some have raised doubts as to his generalship. In particular, charges of rashness have been raised against him. Speed and aggression were key elements in granting success in medieval war, and Talbot&#x27;s numerical inferiority necessitated surprise. Furthermore, he was often in the position of trying to force battle on unwilling opponents. At his defeat at Patay in 1429 he was advised not to fight there by Sir John Fastolf, who was subsequently blamed for the debacle, but the French, inspired by Joan of Arc, showed unprecedented fighting spirit ‚Äì usually they approached an English position with trepidation. The charge of rashness is more justifiable at Castillon, where Talbot, misled by mistaken reports of a French retreat, attacked their entrenched camp frontally with his advance force, facing wheel to wheel field artillery and refusing to temporarily back off and allow his full force to arrive.

On a political level, his governorship of Ireland degenerated into bitter feuding and personal hatreds. The Crown itself reprimanded him for weakening English rule in Ireland, though in fairness he was far from being the only culprit.

==Cultural influence==
He is portrayed heroically in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;: &quot;Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, Created, for his rare success in arms&quot;. Talbot&#x27;s failures are all blamed on Fastolf and feuding factions in the English court. Thomas Nashe, commenting on the play in his booklet &quot;Pierce Penniless&quot;, stated that Talbot&#x27;s example was inspiring Englishmen anew, two centuries after his death,
How would it have joyed brave Talbot, the terror of the French, to think that after he had lain two hundred years in his tomb, he should triumph again on the stage, and have his bones new embalmed with the tears of ten thousand spectators at least (at several times) who in the tragedian that represents his person imagine they behold him fresh bleeding. I will defend it against any collian or clubfisted usurer of them all, there is no immortality can be given a man on earth like unto plays.

===Fiction===
John Talbot is shown as a featured character in Koei&#x27;s video game &quot;&quot;, appearing as the left-arm of Edward, the Black Prince, in which he assists the former and the respective flag of England throughout his many portrayals.

Talbot appears as one of the primary antagonists in the PSP game &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;.

<text>Anna Kavan (born Helen Emily Woods; 10 April 1901 ‚Äì 5 December 1968) was a British novelist, short story writer and painter. Originally publishing under her first married name, Helen Ferguson, she adopted the name Anna Kavan in 1939 as both her pen name and her legal identity. She is most well-known for her 1967 novel, &quot;Ice&quot;, published just a year before her death.

==Biography==

===Early life and background===
Kavan was born Helen Emily Woods in Cannes, as the only child of an affluent British family. Her father, Claude Charles Edward Woods, was a brewer who graduated Jesus College, Cambridge in 1888. He was the son of Matthew Charles Woods of Holeyn Hall, Wylam, and the grandson of William Woods, a banker in Newcastle upon Tyne. Her mother, Helen Eliza Bright, was the daughter of George Charles Bright, physician and son of Richard Bright, and Susan Emmeline Bright (n√©e Cooper).

Kavan&#x27;s parents travelled frequently, and she spent her childhood in both Europe and the United States. When Kavan was around 10 years old, the family moved from Somerset to Rialto, California to start an orange farm. While the business was moderately successful, Kavan&#x27;s father abandoned the family and was found dead around a year later in 1915, having thrown himself from the prow of a ship. After his death, she returned to the UK where she was a boarder at Parsons Mead School in Ashstead and Malvern College in Worcestershire. Kavan has reflected upon her childhood as both incredibly lonely and neglectful, and her fiction often contains portrayals of dysfunctional family relationships.

===Marriages and first hospitalization===
Disregarding her daughter&#x27;s desire to go to Oxford, Kavan&#x27;s mother arranged an encounter with between the then nineteen-year old Kavan and Donald Ferguson, a man both ten years her senior and allegedly her mother&#x27;s former lover. She married him in 1920, a few months before he took a position with as a railroad administrator in colonial Burma. After moving, Kavan began to write and gave birth to her son Bryan. In 1923, the marriage collapsed and Kavan left Ferguson, returning with Bryan to the UK. 

Living alone in London during the mid-1920s, she began studying painting at the London Central School of Arts and Crafts, and continued to paint throughout her life. Kavan regularly travelled to the French Riviera where she was introduced to heroin either by racing car drivers she took up with, a tennis professional who claimed it would improve her game, or through a prescription for morphine to treat depression. While in France, she began an affair with Stuart Edmonds, who she married in 1928. Together the couple travelled through France, Italy, and Spain before resettling in England. A year later in 1929, she published her first novel, &quot;A Charmed Circle&quot;, under the name Helen Ferguson. It follows the story of a pair of sisters, Olive and Beryl Deane, who live in a small town under the tyranny of their hermit father and mother who dote on their cruel older brother-- themes she would return to frequently for the rest of her career. &quot;A Charmed Circle&quot; was followed by five more books over the next eight years: &quot;Let Me Alone&quot; (1930), &quot;The Dark Sisters&quot; (1930), &quot;A Stranger Still&quot; (1935), &quot;Goose Cross&quot; (1936), and &quot;Rich Get Rich&quot; (1937). Most notable of these books is &quot;Let Me Alone&quot;, which follows the protagonist, Anna Kavan, forced into marriage by a cruel aunt and forcefully moved to a tropical &quot;hell&quot; where she is tormented by both the environment and her domineering husband.
Together Kavan and Edmonds had a daughter, Margaret, who died soon after childbirth. They then adopted a girl they named Susanna. In 1938, the marriage had begun to sour and Edmonds began an affair, leading the severely depressed Kavan to attempt suicide. She was then sent to a private clinic in Switzerland to recover. This would be the first of many suicide attempts, hospitalizations, and asylum incarcerations throughout Kavan&#x27;s life for both depression and her lifelong heroin addiction.

===As Anna Kavan===

&quot;Asylum Piece&quot; (1940), a collection of short stories which explores dreamy, strange mindscapes and touches on themes of captivity, mental illness, and the difficulty of the &#x27;patient&#x27; role, was her first book under the name Anna Kavan. This collection marks a drastic change in Kavan&#x27;s style, and all subsequent works would continue to embrace and build upon the experimental, slipstream style exemplified by the collection. However, she did not immediately adopt a new identity as &#x27;Anna Kavan&#x27; in her day-to-day life. She continued to sign her letters as &#x27;Helen&#x27; up until the end of 1940, when she moved to New York.

An inveterate traveller, Kavan initiated a long journey at the outset of World War II. From September 1939 to February 1943, she spent six months in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. The stay inspired her novella, &quot;My Soul in China&quot;, published posthumously in 1975. She also visited the island of Bali, Indonesia, and stayed for twenty-two months in Napier, New Zealand, her final destination. Her travel itinerary was complicated by the war, which severely restricted many ordinary boat routes.

Returning to England early 1943, she worked briefly with soldiers suffering from war neurosis at the Mill Hill Emergency Hospital and studied for a diploma in Psychological Medicine, which she never finished. She also took a secretarial position at &quot;Horizon&quot;, an influential literary magazine edited by Cyril Connolly and founded by Peter Watson, one of her friends. There, she contributed stories, articles, and reviews from 1944 to 1946, Most notable of her work for Horizon is &quot;The Case of Bill Williams&quot;, based on her time as a nurse. During her tenure at &quot;Horizon&quot;, letters indicate that Kavan had begun using cocaine as well as heroin, and may have been supplying it to others in the office, which Connolly disapproved of.

In February 1944, Kavan&#x27;s son from her first marriage, Bryan Gratney Ferguson, died serving in No. 3 Commando during the Second World War.

After her return to the UK, Kavan began treatment with the German psychiatrist . He became Kavan&#x27;s close friend and sometime creative collaborator until his death in 1964. They co-wrote the political satire, &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1949), and Kavan dedicated several short stories to him in the posthumous collection &quot;Julia and the Bazooka&quot; (1970). It was Bluth who arranged for Kavan to be treated at , a modern clinic where important psychiatric advances were made (1857‚Äì1980). There, Kavan received treatment from Ludwig Binswanger, a psychiatrist, pioneer in the field of existential psychology and lifelong friend of Freud.

Kavan continued to undergo sporadic inpatient treatments for heroin addiction and in her later years in London lived as a virtual recluse. She enjoyed a late triumph in 1967 with her novel &quot;Ice&quot;, inspired by her time in New Zealand and the country&#x27;s proximity to the inhospitable frozen landscape of Antarctica. The original manuscript was titled The Cold World. When her publisher Peter Owen sent Kavan his initial response, neither rejecting nor accepting her text, he described it as a cross between Kafka and The Avengers. This post-apocalyptic novel brought critical acclaim. It is her best-known novel, still puzzling the reader for its strangeness and nowadays rather introduced as a slipstream novel than a science fiction one.

The first six of her novels gave little indication of the experimental and disturbing nature of her later work published after her detox treatment. &quot;Asylum Piece&quot; definitely heralded the new style and content of Kavan&#x27;s writing. Her development of &quot;nocturnal language&quot;. involved the lexicon of dreams and addiction, mental instability and alienation. She has been compared to Djuna Barnes, Virginia Woolf, and Sylvia Plath. Brian Aldiss described her as Kafka&#x27;s sister. Ana√Øs Nin was an admirer and unsuccessfully pursued a correspondence with Kavan.

===Death and legacy===

Although popularly supposed to have died of a heroin overdose, Kavan died of heart failure at her home in Kensington and was found dead on 5 December 1968. The previous night she had failed to attend a reception in honor of Ana√Øs Nin at the home of her London-based publisher Peter Owen.

Many of her works were published posthumously, some edited by her friend and legatee, the Welsh writer Rhys Davies. London-based Peter Owen Publishers have been long-serving advocates of Kavan&#x27;s work and continue to keep her work in print. Doris Lessing, J. G. Ballard, Ana√Øs Nin, Jean Rhys, Brian Aldiss, Christopher Priest, Nina Allan, Virginia Ironside and Maggie Gee are among the writers who have praised her work.

In 2009 the Anna Kavan Society was founded in London with the aim of encouraging wider readership and increasing academic scholarship of Kavan&#x27;s work.

Kavan&#x27;s paintings have been recently exhibited at the Zarrow Art Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. &quot;The Unconventional Anna Kavan: Works on Paper&quot; exhibition displayed thirty-six paintings created by Kavan drawn from the McFarlin Library Special Collections, University of Tulsa. The exhibition &quot;Mad, Bad and Sad: Women and the Mind Doctors&quot; at Freud Museum London traced key moments in the history of hysteria and counterpointed these with women&#x27;s inventive art.

==Modern scholarship and interpretations==
In September 2014, the Anna Kavan Society organized a one-day symposium at the Institute of English Studies in association with Liverpool John Moores University Research Centre for Literature and Cultural History and Peter Owen Publishers. The Anna Kavan Symposium brought together scholars and writers to historicize Kavan&#x27;s work (from the post-colonial aspects of Kavan&#x27;s fiction and journalism to the interwar and World War II period), situate her within the literary and intellectual context of her times, and chart her legacy as a writer.

===Feminist readings===
On &quot;Ice&quot; and protofeminism, L.Timmel Duchamp said &quot;First published in 1967, on the eve of the second wave of feminism, &quot;Ice&quot; has never been regarded as a significant work of proto-feminist literature, although scholars occasionally include it on lists of science fiction written by women before the explosion of the genre in the 1970s. The novel&#x27;s surrealist form demands a different sort of reading than that of science fiction driven by narrative causality, but the text&#x27;s obsessive insistence on linking the global political violence of the Cold War with the threateningly lethal sexual objectification of Woman and depicting them as two poles of the same suicidal collective will to destroy life makes &quot;Ice&quot; an interesting feminist literary experiment.&quot;

===Genre-bending and experimental writing===
Kavan&#x27;s reception as a &#x27;woman writer&#x27; has been complicated by her perceived lack of attention to gender politics, and her fiction has most often been interpreted as autobiography rather than experimental and aesthetic writing.

Kavan&#x27;s work is difficult to situate in fixed literary categories; the scope of her work shows her experimenting with realism, surrealism and absurdism. Her work often abandons linear plot and narrative structure and portrays nameless landscapes and nameless characters. Her disruptive narratives are close to the technique of stream of consciousness associated with modernist novelists. Her best-known novel &quot;Ice&quot; has been described as slipstream, a non-realistic fiction that crosses conventional genre boundaries, where Borges&#x27; &quot;Fictions&quot;, Calvino&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Cities&quot; or Ballard&#x27;s &quot;Crash&quot; are cited as &#x27;canon of slipstream writing&#x27;.

===Politics of madness===
Kavan&#x27;s writing of madness, asylum incarceration and opiate addiction offer a complex and thought-provoking perspective on early twentieth-century psychiatry and psychotherapy. As well as being treated in private asylums and nursing homes, Kavan underwent a short analysis at the Tavistock Clinic, experienced Ludwig Binswanger&#x27;s method of existential psychotherapy at the Bellevue Sanatorium, and had a close personal relationship with her longtime psychiatrist Karl Bluth. In her fiction and journalism Kavan promoted a radical politics of madness, giving voice to the disenfranchised and marginalized psychiatric patient and presaging the anti-psychiatry movement.

In the exhibition &quot;Mad, Bad and Sad: Women and the Mind Doctors&quot; at the Freud Museum in London (2013), her work was presented alongside other female explorers of the mind, among them: Mary Lamb, Theroigne de M√©ricourt, Alice James, Anna O, Ida Bauer, Augustine, Elizabeth Severn, Bryher, Annie Winifred Ellerman, Hilda Doolittle, Princess Marie Bonaparte, Anna Freud, Dorothy Burlingham, Zelda Fitzgerald, Virginia Woolf, Marilyn Monroe and Sylvia Plath.

==Influences==

===Literature===
Kavan was friends with the Welsh writer Rhys Davies, who based his 1975 novel &quot;Honeysuckle Girl&quot; on her early life.

===Theater and performance===
Choreographer and stage director, adapted &quot;Ice&quot; for the theater in 2008.

&quot;Silverglass&quot; by DJ Britton is a play about the relationship between Rhys Davies and Anna Kavan. It was presented as a premiere during the Rhys Davies Short Story Conference 2013 held in Swansea. The play is set in the late 1960s and depicts Davies&#x27; late literary recognition as well as Kavan&#x27;s final tragedy. Both writers lived &#x27;a life of self-invention, in which secrets, sexuality and deep questions of personal identity lurked constantly in the shadows&#x27;.

===Music and sound art===

Thalia Zedek is an American singer and guitarist, active since the early 1980s and member of several notable alternative rock groups, including Live Skull and Uzi. &#x27;Sleep Has His House was the inspiration for the album Sleep Asylum of Uzi&#x27; released in 1986.

David Tibet, the primary creative force behind the experimental music/neofolk music group Current 93, named the group&#x27;s album &quot;Sleep Has His House&quot; after Anna Kavan&#x27;s book of the same title.

San Francisco post-rock band Carta titled a song &quot;Kavan&quot; on their album &quot;The Glass Bottom Boat&quot; after Anna Kavan. The song was subsequently released as a remix by The Declining Winter on their album Haunt the Upper Hallways.

Floriane Pochon, French artist, created a sound artwork untitled &quot;Ice Lady&quot; based on the novel &quot;Ice&quot;. It was presented during Les Nuits de la Phaune, a live broadcast event initiated by the Marseille-based in 2008.

Squid&#x27;s 2021 album &quot;Bright Green Field&quot; gets its title from an Anna Kavan short story of the same name. The ninth song on the record, &quot;Peel St.,&quot; is based on Kavan&#x27;s novel &quot;Ice&quot;. The name &quot;Peel St.&quot; comes from the street Kavan lived on.

===Visual arts===
In an installation named Anna, the Wales-based artist duo Heather and Ivan Morison investigate the construction of the self based on ambiguous narratives. They developed an allegorical piece of object theatre draws on the life and works of Kavan using performance and puppetry to connect the objects and play out &quot;a brutal tale of love and loss set against the approaching threat of the ice&quot;. It has been first presented in 2012 at The Hepworth Wakefield in Wakefield, England.

<text>Acclimatization or acclimatisation (also called acclimation or acclimatation) is the process in which an individual organism adjusts to a change in its environment (such as a change in altitude, temperature, humidity, photoperiod, or pH), allowing it to maintain fitness across a range of environmental conditions. Acclimatization occurs in a short period of time (hours to weeks), and within the organism&#x27;s lifetime (compared to adaptation, which is evolution, taking place over many generations). This may be a discrete occurrence (for example, when mountaineers acclimate to high altitude over hours or days) or may instead represent part of a periodic cycle, such as a mammal shedding heavy winter fur in favor of a lighter summer coat. Organisms can adjust their morphological, behavioral, physical, and/or biochemical traits in response to changes in their environment. While the capacity to acclimate to novel environments has been well documented in thousands of species, researchers still know very little about how and why organisms acclimate the way that they do.

==Names==
The nouns &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (and the corresponding verbs &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;) are widely regarded as synonymous, both in general vocabulary and in medical vocabulary. The synonym &quot;&quot; is less commonly encountered, and fewer dictionaries enter it.

==Methods==
===Biochemical===
In order to maintain performance across a range of environmental conditions, there are several strategies organisms use to acclimate. In response to changes in temperature, organisms can change the biochemistry of cell membranes making them more fluid in cold temperatures and less fluid in warm temperatures by increasing the number of membrane proteins. In response to certain stressors, some organisms express so-called heat shock proteins that act as molecular chaperones and reduce denaturation by guiding the folding and refolding of proteins. It has been shown that organisms which are acclimated to high or low temperatures display relatively high resting levels of heat shock proteins so that when they are exposed to even more extreme temperatures the proteins are readily available. Expression of heat shock proteins and regulation of membrane fluidity are just two of many biochemical methods organisms use to acclimate to novel environments.

===Morphological===
Organisms are able to change several characteristics relating to their morphology in order to maintain performance in novel environments. For example, birds often increase their organ size to increase their metabolism. This can take the form of an increase in the mass of nutritional organs or heat-producing organs, like the pectorals (with the latter being more consistent across species).

==The theory==
While the capacity for acclimatization has been documented in thousands of species, researchers still know very little about how and why organisms acclimate in the way that they do. Since researchers first began to study acclimation, the overwhelming hypothesis has been that all acclimation serves to enhance the performance of the organism. This idea has come to be known as the beneficial acclimation hypothesis. Despite such widespread support for the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, not all studies show that acclimation always serves to enhance performance (&quot;See beneficial acclimation hypothesis&quot;). One of the major objections to the beneficial acclimation hypothesis is that it assumes that there are no costs associated with acclimation. However, there are likely to be costs associated with acclimation. These include the cost of sensing the environmental conditions and regulating responses, producing structures required for plasticity (such as the energetic costs in expressing heat shock proteins), and genetic costs (such as linkage of plasticity-related genes with harmful genes).

Given the shortcomings of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, researchers are continuing to search for a theory that will be supported by empirical data.

The degree to which organisms are able to acclimate is dictated by their phenotypic plasticity or the ability of an organism to change certain traits. Recent research in the study of acclimation capacity has focused more heavily on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity rather than acclimation responses. Scientists believe that when they understand more about how organisms evolved the capacity to acclimate, they will better understand acclimation.

==Examples==

=== Plants ===
Many plants, such as maple trees, irises, and tomatoes, can survive freezing temperatures if the temperature gradually drops lower and lower each night over a period of days or weeks. The same drop might kill them if it occurred suddenly. Studies have shown that tomato plants that were acclimated to higher temperature over several days were more efficient at photosynthesis at relatively high temperatures than were plants that were not allowed to acclimate.

In the orchid &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;, phenylpropanoid enzymes are enhanced in the process of plant acclimatisation at different levels of photosynthetic photon flux.

===Animals===

Animals acclimatize in many ways. Sheep grow very thick wool in cold, damp climates. Fish are able to adjust only gradually to changes in water temperature and quality. Tropical fish sold at pet stores are often kept in acclimatization bags until this process is complete. Lowe &amp; Vance (1995) were able to show that lizards acclimated to warm temperatures could maintain a higher running speed at warmer temperatures than lizards that were not acclimated to warm conditions. Fruit flies that develop at relatively cooler or warmer temperatures have increased cold or heat tolerance as adults, respectively (&quot;See&quot; Developmental plasticity).

====Humans====
The salt content of sweat and urine decreases as people acclimatize to hot conditions. Plasma volume, heart rate, and capillary activation are also affected.

Acclimatization to high altitude continues for months or even years after initial ascent, and ultimately enables humans to survive in an environment that, without acclimatization, would kill them. Humans who migrate permanently to a higher altitude naturally acclimatize to their new environment by developing an increase in the number of red blood cells to increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, in order to compensate for lower levels of oxygen intake.

<doc id="400051" wikidata="Q1141983" url="?curid=400051" title="Cruising for sex">
<text>Cruising for sex or cruising is walking or driving about a locality, called a cruising ground, in search of a sex partner, usually of the anonymous, casual, one-time variety. The term is also used when technology is used to find casual sex, such as using an Internet site or a telephone service.

==Origin and historical usage==
According to historian and author Tim Blanning, the term cruising originates from the Dutch equivalent .

In a specifically sexual context, the term &quot;cruising&quot; originally emerged as an argot &quot;code word&quot; in gay slang, by which those &quot;in the know&quot; would understand the speaker&#x27;s unstated sexual intent, whereas most heterosexuals, on hearing the same word in the same context, would normally misread the speaker&#x27;s intended meaning in the word&#x27;s more common nonsexual sense. This served (and in some contexts, still serves) as a protective sociolinguistic mechanism for gay men to recognize each other, and avoid being recognized by those who may wish to do them harm in broader societies noted for their homophobia.

In the latter half of the twentieth century, decriminalization of homosexual behaviour increasingly became the norm in English-speaking countries. The protective barrier once provided by the term &quot;cruising&quot; as a &quot;code word&quot; has therefore largely broken down and, arguably, become increasingly irrelevant. Thus the specifically sexual meaning of the term has passed into common usage to include the sexual behavior of heterosexual persons, as well.

Public health officials have noted that cruising locations are frequented by men who have sex with men, but do not identify with being homosexual or bisexual, who are closeted, married, or in relationships with women, do not date men or frequent gay bars, clubs or websites, or have otherwise no other way of meeting men for sex.

The cruising places are often considered meeting places for men who are otherwise living more conventional lifestyles. For instance, it was noted in Laud Humphreys&#x27; 1970 study about anonymous gay sex meeting places that most men who visited those places were at least seeming heterosexuals who had families.

==Regional usage variants==
In the United States, the term &quot;cruising&quot; was used predominantly to denote exclusively homosexual behavior, but in Australia and the United Kingdom it is used by both homosexuals and heterosexuals to describe their own behavior, as witnessed in the common male heterosexual derivative phrase &quot;cruising for chicks&quot;.

In the United States, cruising often takes place in gay bars, adult video arcades often through gloryholes, adult movie theaters, public toilets, parks, saunas, gyms or gay bathhouses. Engaging in such activities in public places like parks has led to participants being charged with indecent exposure.

In Poland, the term (plural: ; translated as &quot;picket&quot; or &quot;piquet&quot;) is used to describe a similar practice. Origination around the turn of the 19th century, pickets were especially popular during the Polish People&#x27;s Republic period, when homosexuality was more taboo and few people decided to be open about their sexuality. In Warsaw, one of the most prominent locations for pickets was the northern frontage of Three Crosses Square. In the early 21st century, pickets became less popular due to the development of a network of premises for sexual minorities, such as bars, discos and saunas, as well as communication via the Internet.

==In popular culture==
Cruising for sex is alluded to in songs such as &quot;Cruisin&#x27; the Streets&quot; by the Boys Town Gang as well as &quot;I&#x27;m a Cruiser&quot; by the Village People, on the album titled &quot;Cruisin&#x27;&quot;.

In 1980, director William Friedkin made the film &quot;Cruising&quot;, starring Al Pacino. The film introduced many audiences to homosexual activities and the linguistic codes used for them, but gay rights groups perceived a negative depiction of the gay community in the film and protested its production.

Cruising features prominently in the storylines of Joe Pitt and Louis Ironson in Tony Kushner&#x27;s 1991 play about the AIDS crisis in New York City, Angels in America, as well as its 2003 miniseries adaptation by HBO. The miniseries specifically depicts the popular cruising location of The Ramble alongside other locations in Central Park. 

The opening scene of the first episode of the HBO series &quot;Looking&quot; involves the main character Patrick (Jonathan Groff) cruising in a park, mainly out of curiosity of whether the activity is still in practice or not.

Cruising for sex was explored in &quot;Cruising Pavilion&quot;, a 2018 art installation associated with the Venice Biennale of Architecture.

<doc id="400052" wikidata="Q973331" url="?curid=400052" title="Crackles">
<text>Crackles are the clicking, rattling, or crackling noises that may be made by one or both lungs of a human with a respiratory disease during inhalation, and occasionally during exhalation. They are usually heard only with a stethoscope (&quot;on auscultation&quot;). Pulmonary crackles are abnormal breath sounds that were formerly referred to as rales.

&quot;Bilateral crackles&quot; refers to the presence of crackles in both lungs. Basal crackles are crackles apparently originating in or near the base of the lung. &quot;Bibasal crackles&quot;, also called &quot;bilateral basal crackles&quot;, are crackles heard at the bases of both the left and right lungs. 

Crackles are caused by the &quot;popping open&quot; of small airways and alveoli collapsed by fluid, exudate, or lack of aeration during expiration.

Crackles can be heard in people who have pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, acute bronchitis, bronchiectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), interstitial lung disease or post thoracotomy or metastasis ablation. Pulmonary edema secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure and high altitude pulmonary edema can also cause crackles.

==Terminology==
Ren√© Laennec adopted the existing word &quot;&quot; (which has been translated as &quot;rattles&quot;, &quot;groans&quot; and otherwise) to describe the added breath sounds that are now referred to as &quot;crackles&quot;. He described them using unusual daily examples, such as &quot;whistling of little birds&quot;, &quot;crackling of salt on a heated dish&quot;, &quot;cooing of the woodpidgeon&quot;, etc., but he soon realized that he was unable to use the term in front of his patients because it conjured the association of &quot;le r√¢le de la mort&quot;, which translates to &quot;the death rattle&quot;, the noise that people who are about to die make when they can no longer clear secretions. Therefore, at the bedside, he used the Latin word &quot;&quot;, which originally meant a &quot;snore&quot;. That was not clearly understood by his translator, John Forbes, and the terminology became very confusing after the publication in the 1830s of Forbes&#x27;s English translation of Laennec&#x27;s &quot;De L&#x27;Auscultation Mediate&quot;. The difficulty of translating &quot;r√¢le&quot; itself had been remarked upon in a British review of Laennec&#x27;s work in 1820.

The terminology of &quot;rales&quot; and &quot;rhonchi&quot; in English remained variable until 1977, when a standardization was established by the American Thoracic Society and American College of Chest Physicians. As a result, the term &quot;r√¢les&quot; was abandoned, and &quot;crackles&quot; became its recommended substitute. The term &quot;rales&quot; is still common in English-language medical literature, but cognizance of the ATS/CHEST guidelines calls for &quot;crackles&quot;.

==Sound==
Crackles are caused by explosive opening of small airways and are discontinuous, nonmusical, and brief. Crackles are more common during the inspiratory than the expiratory phase of breathing, but they may be heard during the expiratory phase. 

* Crackles are often described as fine, medium, and coarse. They can also be characterized as to their timing: fine crackles are usually late-inspiratory, whereas coarse crackles are early inspiratory.
** Fine crackles are soft, high-pitched, and very brief. This sound can be simulated by rolling a strand of hair between one&#x27;s fingers near the ears or by moistening one&#x27;s thumb and index finger and separating them near the ears. Their presence usually indicates an interstitial process, such as pulmonary fibrosis or congestive heart failure. The sounds from interstitial pulmonary fibrosis have been described as sounding like opening a Velcro fastener.
** Coarse crackles are somewhat louder, lower in pitch, and last longer than fine crackles. Their presence usually indicates an airway disease, such as bronchiectasis.

They can also be described as unilateral or bilateral, as well as dry or moist/wet.

== Associated diagnoses ==
Crackles are often associated with inflammation or infection of the small bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. 

Crackles that do not clear after a cough may indicate pulmonary edema or fluid in the alveoli due to heart failure, pulmonary fibrosis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Crackles that partially clear or change after coughing may indicate bronchiectasis.

== Interobserver consistency ==
In 2016, the European Respiratory Society reported on a study of various physicians listening to audiovisual recordings of auscultation findings and interobserver variation was analyzed. The study found that broad descriptions agreed better than detailed descriptions.

<text>Patrick Leopold Gordon of Auchleuchries (31 March 1635 ‚Äì 29 November 1699) was a general and rear admiral in Russia, of Scottish origin. He was descended from a family of Aberdeenshire, holders of the estate of Auchleuchries, near Ellon. The family was connected with the noble branch of Haddo. As a result of his distinguished service for Sweden, Poland and Russia he rose in ranks from trooper to full general, and became a principal advisor and close friend of Tsar Peter the Great. Gordon assumed the additional Christian name of Leopold when confirmed as a Roman Catholic shortly before his death.

== Life ==
Gordon was born in Auchleuchries, Aberdeenshire, Scotland and brought up and remained a lifelong Roman Catholic, at a time when adherents of that faith were persecuted in Scotland, which had become officially Calvinist. After an education at the parish schools of Cruden and Ellon, at age of fifteen he entered the Collegium Hosianum at Braunsberg (Braniewo), in the Kingdom of Poland; however, his character did not tolerate well the strict and sombre way of life at the school, and he soon decided to return home. He changed his mind, however, before re-embarking on the journey back to Scotland, and after journeying on foot in several parts of Poland, in 1655 he enlisted at Hamburg into the military service of Sweden.

In the course of the next five years he served alternately for Poland and Sweden and was taken prisoner by both. At the Battle of Chudnov in 1660, Gordon was wounded. Upon hearing of the Stuart restoration, Gordon left the Polish service, but found himself unable to obtain military employment in Scotland or England. In 1661, after further experiences as a soldier of fortune, he joined the Russian army under Tsar Aleksei I, and in 1665 was sent on a special mission to England. After his return he distinguished himself in several wars against the Turks and Tatars in southern Russia. Gordon disliked the Russian service, complaining of the corruption and venality of Russian officials, which left him, in his own words, &quot;almost at wits end with vexation&quot;. However, in recognition of his service he was promoted to major-general in 1678, was appointed to the high command at Kiev in 1679, and in 1683 was made lieutenant-general.

He was not the only Scottish soldier in the Tsar&#x27;s service; his compatriots Paul Menzies, Alexander Livingston and many others were among those from lesser houses, or who had little chance of a claim to inheritance, seeking to make a name for themselves.

Gordon visited England and Scotland in 1686. In 1687 and 1689 he took part in expeditions against the Tatars in the Crimea, being made a full general. Later in 1689 a coup broke out in Moscow, and with the troops under his command Gordon virtually decided events in favour of Peter the Great, and against the Regent, Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna. Consequently, he was for the remainder of his life in high favour with the Tsar, who confided to him the command of his capital during his absence from Russia. In 1696, Gordon&#x27;s design of a &quot;moveable rampart&quot; played a key role in helping the Russians take Azov.

One of Gordon&#x27;s greatest achievements was securing permission from the Tsars to establish the first permanent Roman Catholic church and school in Muscovy, of which he remained the main benefactor, and headed the Catholic community in Russia until his death. For his services his second son James, brigadier of the Russian army, was created Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1701.

The Tsar employed him in organizing his army according to the West European system; and raised him to the rank of full general.

He died in Moscow, Russia on 29 November 1699. At the end of his life the Tsar, who had visited Gordon frequently during his illness, was with him when he died, and with his own hands closed his eyes. Originally buried in the Foreign Quarter, his remains were reinterred in 1877, with an inscription in German which mistakenly gives his rank as &quot;Oberst&quot;, Colonel.

Gordon left behind him a uniquely detailed diary of his life and times, written in English. This is preserved in manuscript in the Russian State Military Archive in Moscow. An incomplete and faulty German translation, edited by Dr Moritz Posselt (&quot;Tagebuch des Generals Patrick Gordon&quot;) was published, the first volume at Moscow in 1849, the second at St Petersburg in 1851, and the third at St Petersburg in 1853; and &quot;Passages from the Diary of General Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries&quot; (1635‚Äì1699), was printed, under the editorship of Joseph Robertson, for the Spalding Club, at Aberdeen, Scotland, 1859. A new full scholarly edition of Gordon&#x27;s Diary in English was published by the Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies in Aberdeen (6 vols, 2009‚Äì2016), as well as its translation into Russian.

His daughter Catherine was married firstly to the German-Russian Colonel Rudolf Strasburg, and then from 1698 to his kinsman in the Russian service Alexander Gordon of Auchintoul, author of &quot;The History of Peter the Great, Emperor of Russia&quot;. She lived until 1739.

<doc id="400056" wikidata="Q1194307" url="?curid=400056" title="Umeda">
<text>is a major commercial, business, shopping and entertainment district in Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan, and the city&#x27;s main northern railway terminus (≈åsaka Station, Umeda Station). The district&#x27;s name means &quot;plum field&quot;.

== History ==
Umeda was historically called Umeda Haka (Umeda Grave), because it was one of the seven largest cemeteries of Osaka from the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868) until the first twenty years of the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912). In 2020, survey teams for the Umekita redevelopment project discovered ancient burial remains of over 1,500 people. Experts say these remains were of commoners, not the aristocracy. They used several burial styles, both cremated as well as buried with enclosed wooden caskets, barrel-shaped open containers and earthenware coffins called kameganbo (turtle caskets). They found burial items such as pipes, clay dolls, rokusenmon (a set of six coins to pay passage across the Sanzu River which separates the world of the living and the afterlife) and juzudama (rosary-style prayer beads). A stone wall separated a mass grave with skeletons that were only covered by soil. These are suspected to have died in a plague.

Until the 1870s, the area which is now Umeda was agricultural land. The area was reclaimed and filled in by the prefectural government in the 1870s to support the creation of the first Osaka Station. The word &quot;Umeda&quot; was previously written with different kanji characters; ÂüãÁî∞ (English: &quot;buried field&quot;) to reflect this history. The name was changed to Ê¢ÖÁî∞ (English: &quot;plum field&quot;) without altering the pronunciation, likely due to negative connotations with the previous characters.

The original Osaka Station, a two-story red brick building, was opened in 1874, along with the first railway connecting Osaka and Kobe cities, and in 1876 an additional line to Kyoto. This was essentially the establishment of Umeda as a district. As industry in the area increased at the turn of the century, the station required expansion, so in 1901 the first station was demolished, and a larger station was built in the location where Osaka Station exists in a different form today. Hanshin Umeda station was constructed in 1906, followed by Hankyu Umeda Station in 1910, the Umeda subway station and Midosuji subway line in 1933 and Kitashinchi station in 1997. The current incarnation of Osaka Station was built in 1979, and underwent extensive renovation and reconstruction between 2005 and 2011, including the addition of the North Gate Building, a glass roof covering the tracks, and vast additional retail space providing shops, restaurants, sports centers and movie theatres to the area. For the 2011 re-opening, the station was re-branded Osaka Station City.

The construction of Umeda Sky Building in 1993 and the re-branding of Osaka Station City in 2011 transformed the Umeda area from a business district to a retail and tourist attraction.

== Politics and government ==
Umeda makes up a large part of the Kita Ward of Osaka city. Before 2019, the Kita Ward Electorate could elect three representatives to the Osaka Municipal Assembly. In 2018, the Kita electoral district was represented by Takayama Mia from the Osaka Restoration Association, Maeda Kazuhiko from the Liberal Democratic Party and Yamamoto Tomoko from Komeito.

The number of representatives from Kita was increased to four prior to the April 2019 Japanese unified local elections. The 2019 election saw all three incumbent representatives re-elected, along with Osaka Restoration Association newcomer Kuramoto Takayuki.

== Geography ==
Umeda officially only covers JR West Osaka Station and the immediate area to its south and west, although &quot;Umeda&quot; is often used to describe much of the surrounding area, and is commonly used as a to refer to the downtown area of northern Osaka City.

In addition to JR Osaka Station, Kitashinchi Station, Hankyu Umeda Station and Hanshin Umeda Station are located in this area. Osaka Metro&#x27;s Higashi-Umeda Station and Nishi-Umeda Station provide subway services to and from Umeda, making it a key transportation hub for the greater Osaka area. Underneath the main roads is an underground city which connects most of the local train stations and provides retailers, eateries and access to the area&#x27;s department stores and the Dojima area of Kita ward.

Official districts of Umeda: 
*Umeda 1-chome: Diamond District, Hanshin Department Store, Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts Osaka.
*Umeda 2-chome: Osaka Garden City, Herbis Osaka 
*Umeda 3-chome: Osaka Station, Osaka Garden City, Nishi Umeda Square
The area commonly referred to as Umeda, though outside of Umeda-proper, includes:

*Shibata
*Chayamachi
*Tsuruno
*Toyosaki 2-chome
*Kakuda
*Nakazaki 2-chome, 4-chome
*Komatsubara

These areas are not officially part of the Umeda district, but may use &quot;Umeda&quot; on their buildings, business names, and in their advertising, and are commonly referred to unofficially as the Umeda area. An example of this is the Umeda Sky Building, one of Osaka&#x27;s most recognizable landmarks, which resides not in Umeda but in Oyodo-Naka.

== Districts ==

=== Osaka Station City===
Osaka Station City refers to the immediate area around Osaka Station, above and below ground. JR Osaka Station boasts the largest number of passengers in and out of any station in the JR West network, so Osaka Station City is the central hub of Umeda.

=== Diamond District ===
Umeda 1-chome

Diamond District refers to the area of Umeda 1-chome north of Hanshin Umeda Station and south of Osaka Station. A pentagonal section of Umeda 1-chome surrounded by the Midosuji and Sonezaki Dori roads, which resembles a diamond on the map. The price of land within this area is among the highest in Osaka, so it has come to be known as the &quot;Diamond District&quot;. The area contains some of the largest skyscrapers in Osaka, department stores and recognizable buildings. The Osaka Maru Building has become a symbol of Umeda, due to its early construction and unique cylindrical shape.

Umeda 2-chome / Umeda 3-chome / Osaka Garden City

Nishi-Umeda refers to the area of Osaka Garden City in Umeda 2-chome and 3-chome. The Nishi-Umeda district is the main business center of the Umeda area. Nishi-Umeda hosts the facilities of the Ritz Carlton Osaka, Mainichi Shimbun main office and many corporate headquarters for western Japan, it is easily accessible underground via Hanshin Umeda Station and serviced by the Osaka Metro subway system. The comparatively high concentration of tall buildings in Nishi-Umeda (and neighboring Dojima and Nakanoshima) form a prominent skyscraper district.

The Hankyu Umeda/Kita-Umeda district is the area of Umeda immediately surrounding Hankyu Umeda Station, the largest terminal of the Hankyu Corporation. The area extending to the east and north of the station hosts many buildings owned or funded by the Hankyu Corporation, so it is colloquially referred to as Hankyu-mura (lit:Hankyu village). Buildings such as the HEP Five building and Ferris wheel, Hankyu Mens department store, TOHO Cinemas, the Hankyu Grand Building, Hankyu Sanbangai shopping street, a string of antique book and art sellers, and the main branch of Hankyu Department Store, a 187 meter, 41-story building.

The west side of Hankyu station hosts hotels, restaurants, fitness clubs, and the Hankyu Corporation&#x27;s headquarters. The area to the northeast of the station has been rapidly developing since the 1990s. The Chayamachi area, in particular, is growing quickly since the construction of NU Chayamachi shopping mall.

=== Osaka Station North ===
Ofukacho, Shibata 2-chome

The area to the north of JR Osaka Station. This area hosts the Seiseikai Nakatsu Hospital, JR West Japan Headquarters, and JR Umeda Freight Station. Since large-scale redevelopment is being undertaken in the area, land prices have been rising, and now Obukacho 4-chome has become the site with the highest land prices in West Japan. The area&#x27;s rise has been attributed to the opening of the large Yodobashi Camera electronics department store in 2001, and since then other large developments such as Grand Front Osaka and a satellite campus of Osaka University have been completed. It is commonly called &quot;Umekita&quot;.

Komatsubara, Hoyama, Sonezaki, Taiyuji, Togano, Doyama-cho

Located to the east of JR Osaka Station, it is a less-developed area of Umeda, with fewer skyscrapers, and generally far smaller buildings. Higashi-Umeda is known for its low-cost retailers in the covered Hankyu Higashidori and Sonezaki Ohatsutenjin shopping streets. The area boasts a bustling nightlife, with Japanese izakaya bars, restaurants, arcades, sex shops, love hotels and pachinko parlors. The area hosts the Tsuyu-no-Tenjinsha shinto shrine. Doyama-cho is one of Japan&#x27;s few LGBT districts, and known to be the home to one of the largest homosexual communities in west Japan.

=== Kitashinchi ===
Kitashinchi was a high-class entertainment district of Osaka until the end of the bubble era, at which point its reputation decreased. It has been known as a red light district since the Edo period. The area hosts restaurants, karaoke, hostess clubs, snack bars, brothels, and pole dance bars. The area is famous for its kushikatsu restaurants.

T≈çru Hashimoto, former mayor of Osaka and Governor of Osaka Prefecture, while working as a lawyer in the Tobitashinchi red light district in the south of Osaka, was revealed to have had an affair with hostesses in Kitashinchi before entering politics, a scandal that led to heavy criticism during political campaigns, along with allegations of ties to yakuza.

=== Underground City ===
The Osaka Underground City was completed in 1942 as a station underpass but has been dramatically expanded since. The total underground area extends from Chayamachi in the north to Dojima in the south, and Doyamacho in the east to Osaka Garden City in the west. The area connects the shopping malls of Whity Umeda and Diamor Osaka with the basements of Hankyu Sanbangai, Hankyu Department Store, Hanshin Department Store, JR Osaka Station, Osaka Ekimae Building, Osaka Toukoku Life Building, New Hankyu Building, and Herbis Osaka. More expansions to the underground city are planned to be completed by the end of 2022.

<doc id="400058" wikidata="Q1644650" url="?curid=400058" title="Sarah T. Hughes">
<text>Sarah Tilghman Hughes (born Sarah Augusta Tilghman; August 2, 1896 ‚Äì April 23, 1985) was an American lawyer and federal judge who served on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. She is best known as the judge who swore in Lyndon B. Johnson as President of the United States on Air Force One after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963. She is the first woman to have sworn in a US President. The photo depicting Hughes administering the oath of office to Johnson is widely viewed as the most famous photo ever taken aboard Air Force One.

==Early life, family and education==
Born Sarah Augusta Tilghman in Baltimore, Maryland, she was the daughter of Elizabeth ( Haughton) and James Cooke Tilghman. She went to high school at Western Female High School (now Western High School) in Baltimore, where she was elected president of the freshman class. Standing only five feet one-half inch at maturity, she was described by a classmate as &quot;small but terrible&quot;. Her determined personality extended to the athletic field where she participated in intramural track and field, gymnastics, and basketball. Her strong personal discipline was seen in her habit of going to bed by 8 pm and getting up at 4 am, a habit she continued through much of her life. After graduating from Western High School, she attended Goucher College, an all-women&#x27;s college in central Baltimore near home. She participated in athletics at Goucher. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1917.

Two years later, she moved to Washington, D.C. and attended The George Washington University Law School classes at night. She graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1922.

==Career== 
After college, Hughes taught science at Salem Academy in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for two years. In 1919 she moved to Washington, D.C., and attended The George Washington University Law School classes at night and during the day worked as a police officer. As a police officer, Hughes did not carry a gun or wear a police uniform because she worked to prevent crimes among women and girls, patrolling areas where female runaways and prostitutes were normally found. Her job was an expression of the progressive idea of rehabilitation instead of punishment. Hughes later credited this job with instilling in her a sense of commitment and responsibility to women and children. At that time she lived in a tent home near the Potomac River and commuted to the campus by canoe each evening.

In 1922, she moved to Dallas, Texas, with her husband George Ernest Hughes, whom she had met at law school. He quickly found employment, but Sarah faced significant obstacles as a woman during a time in which law firms generally did not regard women as qualified. Eventually, Priest, Herndon, and Ledbetter, a small law firm, gave her a rent-free space and even referred some cases to her in exchange for her services as a receptionist.

As her practice grew, she became increasingly active in local women&#x27;s organizations. She joined the Zonta Club, the Business and Professional Women&#x27;s Club, the Dallas Women&#x27;s Political League, the League of Women Voters, YWCA, Dallas College Club, and the American Association of University Women. Hughes served as Chair of the AAUW Committee on the Economic and Legal Status of Women, advocating equal pay jury service for women, and improved status and recognition for women in the Armed Services.

She practiced law for eight years in Dallas before becoming involved in politics, first being elected in 1930 to three terms in the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat. In 1935, Hughes accepted an appointment as a state judge from Governor James Burr V Allred for the Fourteenth District Court in Dallas, becoming the state&#x27;s first female district judge. In 1936, she was elected to the same post. She was re-elected six more times and remained in that post until 1961.

==Federal judicial service==

Hughes received a recess appointment from President John F. Kennedy on October 5, 1961, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, to a new seat authorized by 75 Stat. 80. She was nominated to the same position by President Kennedy on January 15, 1962. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 16, 1962, and received her commission on March 17, 1962. She was the only female judge appointed by President Kennedy, the first female federal judge in Texas and the third female to serve in the federal judiciary. She assumed senior status on August 4, 1975. Her service terminated on April 23, 1985, due to her death.

===Circumstances of appointment===

The appointment almost did not happen, according to the historian Robert Caro, because the Kennedy administration thought that Hughes was &quot;too old&quot; and they were seeking younger jurists for the lifetime tenure afforded under Article III for federal judgeships. Hughes had been a &quot;longtime Johnson ally&quot;, and as vice president, Johnson had asked Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general of the United States and brother of President John F. Kennedy, &quot;to nominate Mrs. Hughes&quot; for the Federal bench, but the United States Justice Department turned him down. Johnson then offered the job to another attorney. However, Hughes was also an ally of the speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, who held up a bill important to Robert Kennedy until Hughes&#x27; appointment was announced. Johnson was outraged at the chain of events because it appeared to be an intentional attempt to insult him, and made him look like the &quot;biggest liar and fool in the history of the State of Texas&quot;. President Kennedy&#x27;s White House appointments secretary called it a &quot;terrible mistake&quot;, citing negligence on the part of Kennedy&#x27;s staff. The story of how Hughes received her appointment made the rounds of Washington, D.C., insiders, including the political gossip columnists Evans and Novak, which hurt Johnson&#x27;s reputation for political effectiveness. Historian Steven Gillon agrees with Caro&#x27;s story, although it was not cross-cited.

==Women on juries==

Hughes was concerned over the ineligibility of women in Texas to serve on juries even though they had the right to vote. She and Helen Edmunds Moore coauthored a proposed amendment that would allow women on juries in Texas, but the bill failed and went nowhere. Despite defeat, Hughes became closely identified with this cause and few people were recognized as working harder for this right. Due in to part to Hughes&#x27;s work, Texas women secured the right to serve on juries in 1954.

==Administering the oath of office==
Two years into her tenure as a federal district judge, on November 22, 1963, Hughes was called upon to administer the oath of office to Lyndon B. Johnson after the assassination of President Kennedy, a task usually performed by the Chief Justice of the United States. According to an interview with Barefoot Sanders, who was United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas at the time:

Hughes believed that President Johnson chose her to administer the oath of office due to their friendship, and because Johnson was not pleased with other federal judges in Dallas. Because of this, Hughes was the most suitable choice. Sanders and Hughes no doubt believed those rationales, but Johnson had other reasons to choose her, according to Caro: &quot;He knew who he wanted - and she was in Dallas&quot;. Citing another historian, Max Holland, Caro noted that the circumstances surrounding Hughes&#x27;s appointment meant that she &quot;&#x27;personified Johnson&#x27;s utter powerlessness&#x27;&quot; when he was vice president. The new president ordered his staff, &quot;&#x27;Get Sarah Hughes ... Find her.&#x27;&quot; Hughes was found and driven to Love Field, while Air Force One‚Äîand thus the inauguration of the new president‚Äîwas held up just for her. Caro asserts that Johnson, in his insecurities, chose Hughes to show to the world that he was now powerful. Two other historians (Holland and Gillen) agree with Caro&#x27;s assessment that Johnson was still upset that he&#x27;d not been consulted on Hughes&#x27;s appointment in the first place, so it was a way to placate his ego. On the other hand, Johnson needed to make sure that &quot;the swearing-in take place at the earliest possible moment ... to demonstrate, quickly, continuity and stability to the nation and the world. ... &quot; Johnson used the &quot;few minutes to spare&quot; while waiting for Hughes to arrive to plead to Kennedy&#x27;s staffers to stay awhile for the transition. Finally, she arrived, along with the media and Jackie Kennedy; only then the swearing-in could take place. Hughes noted that Jackie&#x27;s &quot;eyes &#x27;were cast down&#x27;&quot; when Johnson nodded to the judge to start the oath of office.

==Other significant contributions==

Hughes was involved in multiple court decisions, including &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, &quot;Shultz v. Brookhaven General Hospital&quot;, and &quot;Taylor v. Sterrett&quot;. Hughes was a member of the three-judge panel that first heard the case of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;; the panel&#x27;s decision was subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. In &quot;Taylor v. Sterrett&quot;, she argued to upgrade prisoner treatment in the Dallas County jail. Hughes noted that &quot;the Dallas County Jail was very much in need of change. It was in deplorable condition, and [she] think[s], that under [her] jurisdiction, it became one of the best jails in the whole United States&quot;.

==Later years==
She retired from the active federal bench in 1975, though she continued to work as a judge with senior status until 1982. A close friend of Lyndon Johnson and his family, Hughes participated in his inauguration in 1965, took part in the book signing of Lady Bird Johnson&#x27;s White House memoirs, and participated in the dedication of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.

==Legacy==
The Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Hughes&#x27; alma mater, Goucher College, was founded in the 1950s with a grant from the Maurice and Laura Falk Foundation. The special collections reading room of the University of North Texas Libraries is also named in her honor.

The dress Hughes wore when swearing in Lyndon Johnson on Air Force One was donated to a wax museum in Grand Prairie, Texas, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1988.

==Personal life and demise==
At law school, she met George Ernest Hughes, and they married March 13, 1922, the same year she received her law degree. 
Hughes and her husband were Episcopalians. They had no children. George died on June 1, 1964.

In 1982, Hughes suffered a debilitating stroke which confined her to a nursing home in Dallas. She died three years later on April 23, 1985.

<doc id="400059" wikidata="Q716948" url="?curid=400059" title="George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly">
<text>George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly (c. 1592March 1649), styled Earl of Enzie from 1599 to 1636, eldest son of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly by Lady Henrietta Stewart, daughter of Esm√© Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, born at Huntly Castle, Huntly, Aberdeenshire, in Scotland was brought up in England as a Protestant, and later created Viscount Aboyne by Charles I.

==Life==
George, Lord Gordon was brought to royal court in Edinburgh February 1596 and in November 1596 at the time of the baptism of Princess Elizabeth as a pledge or hostage for his father&#x27;s good behaviour, and to be brought up in the Protestant religion and taught by Robert Rollock. In July 1602 Anne of Denmark suggested he should marry a sister of the Earl of Moray, one of her ladies-in-waiting, possibly Margaret Stewart. A committee of arbitrators in the feud between Huntly and Moray, called the &quot;4 Stewarts&quot; advised he marry a daughter of the Earl of Argyll, which he later did.

Some of his earlier years, when he was still Lord Gordon, were spent in England at the court of James I, who took care to educate him in the Protestant faith and created him Earl of Enzie. In 1609 he received a commission of justiciary under the great seal against the members of a rebellious society in the north called the &quot;Society of Boys&quot;. In 1613, he was employed by his father in connection with a dispute regarding his superiority over a portion of Lochaber, held by Lochiel and the Camerons. A treaty was at last signed between Lochiel and Enzie on 24 March 1618, by which Lochiel, on certain terms, agreed to renounce his rights to several estates under dispute, one of the stipulations being that he should obtain assistance against his old enemies the Mackintoshes.

Enzie had also a private ground of quarrel against Mackintosh on account of his failure to perform certain services for lands held of the earl and his father. Having on this account obtained a decree against him from the privy council, he besieged him in his castle of Culloden, and compelled him to flee southwards, first to Edinburgh and then to England. Enzie cited him to appear before the privy council, and on his failing to appear he was denounced as a rebel. Mackintosh, being at court, appealed to the king, but after Enzie went to London to give his version of the matter in dispute, Mackintosh was ordered to enter himself in ward in the castle of Edinburgh until he should give the earl satisfaction. In 1622 Enzie received a commission from the privy council to proceed against the Earl of Caithness, but before the commission was carried into effect it was superseded by another from the king to proceed on a mission to France. He remained in that country for some years in command of a company of gens d&#x27;armes. On 20 April 1632 he was created Viscount of Aboyne. On the death of his father in June 1636 he was still in France, but in October following returned to England along with his wife, his sister Lady Anne, and two sons, and on 23 June 1637 arrived in Strathbogie.

==Covenanter movement==
Notwithstanding his father&#x27;s differences with the government, the second Marquess found himself in the enjoyment of the royal favour. He had been educated at court along with Prince Henry and Prince Charles; and as a Protestant episcopalian he was naturally relied on to render the utmost assistance to the government in their policy towards the covenanters. His supreme influence in the north served to balance that of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll in the west. In 1638 he caused the royal proclamation to be read at the New Aberdeen&#x27;s mercat cross. At the beginning of the dispute with the king the covenanters sent to him Colonel Robert Munro as their ambassador, offering, if he would cast in his lot with them, not only to make him their leader, but to pay all his debts, which were said to amount to ¬£100,000 sterling. But &quot;to this proposition,&quot; says Gordon, &quot;Huntly pave a short and resolute repartee, that his family had risen and stood by the kings of Scotland, and for his part, if the event proved the ruin of the king, he was resolved to lay his life, honours, and estate under the rubbish of the king his ruins&quot;. He therefore not only refused to subscribe the covenant, but in September, alone of the other noblemen appointed in the north, accepted the commission of the king to cause the people to subscribe the king&#x27;s covenant and band.

In 1639, Huntly was secretly appointed the king&#x27;s lieutenant in the north, and, information reaching him that a gathering of the covenanters was to be held at Turriff on 14 February, he resolved to disperse them, but when Montrose marched to their support with a body of eight hundred men Huntly contented himself with making a demonstration by marching past them in battle array with a force of two thousand men, without &quot;ony kind of offence or inurious word&quot;, and immediately afterwards disbanded his troops. As a reason for this indecision, Huntly is stated to have affirmed that he had no warrant from the king to strike the first blow. This is confirmed by Burnet, but Burnet also attributes his indecisive action during the whole covenanting struggle to his astrological studies, by which he had become convinced that neither the king, nor the Hamiltons, nor Montrose (who afterwards opposed the covenanters) would prosper. On this account, though ‚Äònaturally a gallant man,‚Äô says Burnet, ‚Äòhe made a poor figure during the whole course of the wars‚Äô.

At the beginning it is, however, evident that he was insufficiently supported from the south, and though inclined to do what he could for the king, he was not disposed to run too great risks. He had been promised the assistance of five thousand men under Hamilton, but they failed to make their appearance, and the covenanters displayed such energy that Huntly on 15 March sent commissioners to treat with Montrose. The answer of Montrose was unsatisfactory, and Huntly, having caused his lieutenancy to be proclaimed at the cross of Aberdeen, began to collect his forces at Inverurie. Meanwhile, he again sent commissioners to Montrose, but before their return he had disbanded his followers and retired to Stathbogie. Aberdeen, having been thus wholly abandoned, was entered by Montrose without opposition on 30 March. On 1 April Montrose and Leslie set out for Inverurie with ‚Äòresolution to discusse and find out Huntly‚Äô. There they remained ‚Äòupon free quarter,‚Äô allowing their men to rifle, or, according to a term now introduced by Leslie and his soldiers into the English language from the German, to ‚Äòplunder‚Äô the houses of those who had fled. Huntly, who had retired to the Bog of Gight, deeming further resistance to be meanwhile vain, sent commissioners to request an interview with Montrose. This took place at the village of Lewes in Fyvie on 5 April, when Huntly, though not subscribing the covenant, agreed to throw no hindrance in the way of his followers doing so, and engaged that those who had scruples in signing should enter into an obligation to maintain the laws and liberties of Scotland. He was then permitted to return to Strathbogie, Montrose retiring to Aberdeen. Soon afterwards a meeting of the covenanting leaders was held at Aberdeen for the settlement of the north. On being summoned to the meeting Huntly agreed to attend it on receiving a safe-condnct, guaranteeing that he should be at full liberty to return home after the conference was over. This was granted him by Montrose, probably in good faith, but, apparently overborne by the clamour of the Frasers, the Forbeses, the Crichtons, and other sworn enemies of Huntly, he contrived to find excuses for arresting him, notwithstanding his safe-conduct. On the evening of 11 April he invited Huntly and his sons to supper, and there hinted to him the advisability of his resigning the lieutenandry, and also writing favourably to the king of the covenanters as good and loyal subjects. Huntly readily agreed, but perhaps Montrose suspected that he was only temporising, for that evening guards were placed at his lodging to prevent his escape. On the morrow he had another interview with Montrose, who now solicited his aid in defraying the expenses of the expedition, and also required him to take steps to apprehend James Grant and others who had opposed the covenanters. Huntly declined to comply with either of these demands, and when he was further requested to take his hereditary enemy Crichton of Frendraught by the hand, he declared that this last he would do on no condition whatever. Montrose then ingenuously asked him if he had any objection to accompany him to Edinburgh, and on Huntly confessing that he would rather not, expressed the opinion that it would be well for him to do it. Huntly then demanded back the bond he had signed at Inverurie before he gave an answer, and on receiving it asked whether he wished him to go south as a captive or as a volunteer. ‚ÄòMake your choice,‚Äô said Montrose. ‚ÄòThen,‚Äô said Huntly, ‚ÄòI will not go as a captive, but as a volunteer‚Äô. Huntly, accordingly, with his two eldest sons accompanied Montrose to Edinburgh ‚Äòunder a guard, though not disarmed or a prisoner‚Äô. On his arrival in Edinburgh an attempt was made by the leaders of the covenanters to induce him to sign the covenant, ‚Äòvery honourable terms being offered him,‚Äô but to their demand he gave a written refusal, dated 20 April, and afterwards published, which concluded with these words: ‚ÄòFor my oune pairt, I am in your power, and resolved not to leave that foule title of traitor as ane inheritance upon my posteritye. Yow may tacke my heade from my shoulders, but not my heart from my soveraigne‚Äô.

In accordance with the first article of the treaty of Berwick, on 20 June of the same year he received his liberty, and immediately with his son proceeded southwards to the king&#x27;s camp, where he remained till the king&#x27;s departure for London on 29 July. Returning to Edinburgh, Huntly remained for some time with his three daughters in a lodging in the Canongate, and at the ensuing parliament he signed the covenant; but after the festivities connected with the marriage of two of his daughters were over, he gave up his house in the Canongate and joined the king in England. While Huntly was confined in the castle of Edinburgh, the Gordons, encouraged by the rumours of the king&#x27;s advance towards Scotland, began to plunder the covenanters, and, having convened all the inhabitants of Turriff, compelled them to sign the king&#x27;s covenant; but shortly afterwards the minister of Turriff convened the inhabitants, and, after causing them to crave public pardon for their breach of the covenant, absolved them from their oath and subscription of the covenant of the king. After Huntly had gone to England, his second son, James Gordon, second Viscount Aboyne, endeavoured to uphold the cause of the king in his father&#x27;s territories, but was routed by Montrose at the Battle of the Brig of Dee, 19 June 1639, after a fiercely fought two-day battle. In 1640, Huntly&#x27;s lands were plundered, and his castle of Strathbogie taken by General Monro, who placed a garrison in it.

==Charles I==
In 1641 Huntly accompanied Charles I to Scotland, and in the procession to the parliament rode after the lord high commissioner, but as he refused to subscribe the covenant he was debarred from taking part in the deliberations. He was nominated one of the king&#x27;s privy councillors, but his name was subsequently deleted by the estates. On the king&#x27;s departure for London he attended him to Berwick. On 1 January 1642 he arrived at Aberdeen on his way to Strathbogie, having been absent from his own territory since April 1639. He now found his affairs in so ruinous a condition that on the advice of his friends he renounced the estate to his son Lord Gordon, for the payment of his debts and provision of his children, reserving to himself the sum of 10,000 merks of yearly rent, with his castle of Strathbogie and his house in Old Aberdeen. In August 1643, he was summoned to appear before a convention of the estates at Edinburgh, and failing to do so he was denounced and registered at the horn. 
He therefore wrote, sending apologies for his non-appearance, but they were rejected, and when he offered to retire to France, a license was refused him. On 20 December 1643 he was visited in the Bog of Gight by a deputation of ministers sent to require him to subscribe the covenant, but this he declined. In the following January the sheriff principal of Aberdeen was directed to secure his apprehension, but declined to do so on the plea that the Bog of Gight was outside his jurisdiction. The duty was then transferred to the sheriff of Banff, but on his appearing at the Bog of Gight Huntly refused to recognise his commission.

==Hiding==
Huntly was apparently inclined to peace, but the action of the government drove him to assume hostilities in self-defence. On 19 March 1643-4 a band of his followers ‚Äòcame galloping through the Old Town to New Aberdeen,‚Äô and taking the provost and other magistrates prisoners, brought them to Strathbogie. On 16 March Huntly had published a declaration protesting that any acts of hostility he might commit were in self-defence, and on the 20th explained that his reason for seizing the provost and other magistrates was that they ‚Äòwere well known to have been scandalous fomenters of a dangerous distraction‚Äô. On the 24th he entered the city at the head of 240 horse, and on the 28th plundered the town of its arms and ammunition. Before leaving the city he drew up a band disclaiming the covenant, and binding all who signed it to the service of the king against the covenanters. A party of his followers afterwards made an attack on the town of Montrose, but retreated northwards to Aberdeen on the approach of the forces of the covenanters under Argyll. Huntly, notwithstanding the resolute words of his own band, did not await Argyll&#x27;s appearance, but, though urged by his followers to give battle, left the city on the last day of April, ‚Äòcontrary to the expectation of many‚Äô.

On Sunday 12 May 1644 his excommunication was read from the pulpit of Old Aberdeen. Argyll then advanced into his territories, but already Huntly had disbanded his followers, and shut himself up in Auchindown. Learning Argyll&#x27;s approach he went to the Bog of Gight, and, having taken a supply of gold and silver and other necessaries, crossed over to Sutherlandshire in a boat. He then rode to Caithness, and went by sea to Strathnaver, where he remained till 5 October 1645. During his absence Argyll marched to Strathbogie and spoiled his lands. Huntly&#x27;s sudden collapse and flight was not altogether occasioned by the advance of Argyll, but by disinclination to co-operate with his old enemy Montrose, who had now joined the king&#x27;s party, and had been appointed lieutenant-general of the forces in Scotland. &quot;The Marquis of Huntly,&quot; said Gordon, &quot;could never be got to join cordially&quot; with Montrose, &quot;or swallow that indignity&quot;, and Guthry affirms that Huntly &quot;did his utmost to spoil the business in Montrose&#x27;s hands&quot;.

But Huntly&#x27;s conduct was entirely passive. On the appearance of Montrose in Strathbogie the Gordons withdrew before him, and as all his efforts to open up communication with Huntly himself were vain, it was impossible to induce them to join the standard of the king. After the defeat of Montrose at Philiphaugh (13 September 1645), Huntly, who had some time previously returned to his territories, raised a force of sixteen hundred foot and six hundred horse, with which he stormed Aberdeen; but with his usual indecision he soon returned again to Strathbogie. In December of the same year Charles sent Robert Leslie, brother of General David Leslie, to Huntly, informing him of his desire to escape from the Scots army to the north, and asking him to levy a force to maintain his cause. This Huntly proceeded to do, but his preparations were to no purpose, as the king remained a prisoner in England. Huntly was excepted from the general pardon of 12 March 1647, and a reward of ¬£1,000 was offered for his apprehension. General David Leslie was despatched against him, and on his approach Huntly fled to the Lochaber mountains.

==Capture==
After evading pursuit for several months by constantly changing his hiding-place, he was at last, in December, captured by Lieutenant-colonel Menzies at midnight, as he was retiring to bed, at Delnabo in Strathavon. The capture was effected after a severe struggle with the ten gentlemen and servants who were in attendance on him, six of whom were slain in their efforts to defend him. On the news of his capture becoming known, about five hundred men under Grant of Carron assembled to effect his rescue, but Menzies, for greater security, carried him to the castle of Blairfindie in Glenlivet. Huntly, on learning their intentions, also sent them a message, dissuading them from the enterprise. When news of his capture reached the committee of estates, it was debated whether he should be immediately executed or reprieved till the meeting of parliament, and the latter motion was carried by one vote. After remaining two days at Leith, he was delivered up to the magistrates of Edinburgh, and sent to the Tolbooth. There he remained till 22 March 1649, when by order of the Scots parliament he was beheaded on the block at the Market Cross of Edinburgh on the Royal Mile. 

On being asked by one of the presbyterian ministers who attended him whether he wished to be absolved from the sentence of excommunication that had been passed against him, he answered &quot;that as he was not accustomed to give ear to false prophets, he did not wish to be troubled by him.&quot; Although he refused to admit that he had acted contrary to the laws, or had done anything to deserve death, he declared that he freely forgave those who had voted for his death. His body was brought to Seton, and was interred in the burial-place of that family.

==Family==
By his wife, Lady Anna Campbell, eldest daughter of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll, he had five sons and five daughters, including:
*Lord George Gordon, killed at the battle of Alford in 1645.
*James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne (d. 1649).
*Lewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly, who succeeded as third Marquess, and was the father of George, fourth Marquess, 
These three older sons all distinguished themselves in the defence of the royal cause.
*Charles Gordon, was in 1660 created Earl of Aboyne by Charles II
*Henry Gordon, who distinguished himself in the service of Poland.
*Anne Gordon was married to the third Earl of Perth.
*Henrietta Gordon , first to George, Lord Seton, secondly to John, second Earl of Traquair.
*Alexander Gordon, (b.1642) married to Jane Robinson
*Jean Gordon, married to Thomas Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Haddington.
*Mary Gordon, married to Alexander Irvine of Drum. 
*Catherine Gordon became a lady-in-waiting to Marie Louise Gonzaga, Queen of Poland, consort of both brothers Kings W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa and John II Casimir Vasa.; married to Jan Andrzej Morsztyn with whom she had descendants including their great-grandson Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus of Poland

<text>Neil James Alexander Sloane FLSW (born October 10, 1939) is a British-American mathematician. His major contributions are in the fields of combinatorics, error-correcting codes, and sphere packing. Sloane is best known for being the creator and maintainer of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).

==Biography==
Sloane was born in Beaumaris, Anglesey, Wales, in 1939, moving to Cowes, Isle of Wight, England in 1946. The family emigrated to Australia, arriving at the start of 1949. Sloane then moved from Melbourne to the United States in 1961.

He studied at Cornell University under Nick DeClaris, Frank Rosenblatt, Frederick Jelinek and Wolfgang Heinrich Johannes Fuchs, receiving his Ph.D. in 1967. His doctoral dissertation was titled &quot;Lengths of Cycle Times in Random Neural Networks&quot;. Sloane joined Bell Labs in 1968 and retired from its successor AT&amp;T Labs in 2012. He became an AT&amp;T Fellow in 1998. He is also a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales, an IEEE Fellow, a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.

He is a winner of a  Lester R. Ford Award in 1978 and the Chauvenet Prize in 1979. In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. In 2005 Sloane received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal.
In 2008 he received the Mathematical Association of America David P. Robbins Prize, and in 2013 the George P√≥lya Award.

In 2014, to celebrate his 75th birthday, Sloane shared some of his favorite integer sequences. Besides mathematics, he loves rock climbing and has authored two rock-climbing guides to New Jersey.

He regularly appears in videos for Brady Haran&#x27;s YouTube channel Numberphile.

<text>A hardcover, hard cover, or hardback (also known as hardbound, and sometimes as casebound) book is one bound with rigid protective covers (typically of binder&#x27;s board or heavy paperboard covered with buckram or other cloth, heavy paper, or occasionally leather). It has a flexible, sewn spine which allows the book to lie flat on a surface when opened. Modern hardcovers may have the pages glued onto the spine in much the same way as paperbacks. Following the ISBN sequence numbers, books of this type may be identified by the abbreviation Hbk.

==Overview==
Hardcover books are often printed on acid-free paper, and they are much more durable than paperbacks, which have flexible, easily damaged paper covers. Hardcover books are marginally more costly to manufacture. Hardcovers are frequently protected by artistic dust jackets, but a &quot;jacketless&quot; alternative has increased in popularity: these &quot;paper-over-board&quot; or &quot;jacketless&quot; hardcover bindings forgo the dust jacket in favor of printing the cover design directly onto the board binding.

==Marketing==
If brisk sales are anticipated, a hardcover edition of a book is typically released first, followed by a &quot;trade&quot; paperback edition (same format as hardcover) the next year. Some publishers publish paperback originals if slow hardback sales are anticipated. For very popular books these sales cycles may be extended, and followed by a mass market paperback edition typeset in a more compact size and printed on thinner, less hardy paper. This is intended to, in part, prolong the life of the immediate buying boom that occurs for some best sellers: After the attention to the book has subsided, a lower-cost version in the paperback, is released to sell further copies. In the past the release of a paperback edition was one year after the hardback, but by the early 21st century paperbacks were released six months after the hardback by some publishers. It is very unusual for a book that was first published in paperback to be followed by a hardback. One example is the novel &quot;The Judgment of Paris&quot; by Gore Vidal, which had its revised edition of 1961 first published in paperback, and later in hardcover.

==Prices==
Hardcover books are usually sold at higher prices than comparable paperbacks. Books for the general public are usually printed in hardback only for authors who are expected to be successful, or as a precursor to the paperback to predict sale levels; however, many academic books are often only published in hardcover editions.

==Usual structure==

Hardcovers usually consist of a page block, two boards, and a cloth or heavy paper covering. The pages are sewn together and glued onto a flexible spine between the boards, and it too is covered by the cloth. A paper wrapper, or dust jacket, is usually put over the binding, folding over each horizontal end of the boards. Dust jackets serve to protect the underlying cover from wear. On the folded part, or flap, over the front cover is generally a blurb, or a summary of the book. The back flap is where the biography of the author can be found. Reviews are often placed on the back of the jacket. Many modern bestselling hardcover books use a partial cloth cover, with a cloth-covered board on the spine only, and only boards covering the rest of the book.

<doc id="400068" wikidata="Q386682" url="?curid=400068" title="Khost">
<text>Kh≈çst () is the capital of Khost Province in Afghanistan. It is the largest city in the southeastern part of the country, and also the largest in the region of Loya Paktia. To the south and east of Khost lie Waziristan and Kurram in Pakistan. Khost is the home of Shaikh Zayed University. The Khost Airport is located in the eastern area of the city.

==Geography==

Khost is located about 150 kilometres south of Kabul. Khost lies on a plateau not below in elevation that extends to the east for about until the Pakistan border. Thirty kilometres, to the north the peaks rise up to while farther south away from the border, the average is around 1,800 m.

===Climate===
Khost has a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen &quot;BSk&quot; though very close to qualifying as &quot;BSh&quot;). Khost is located in the &quot;Khost Bowl&quot;, a valley with lower elevation than the surrounding highlands. The geography afforded more moderate weather conditions. With a January average of , Khost has noticeably milder winters, compared to the much harsher and snowy winters of the surrounding higher towns to the north, west, and south (listed anticlockwise): Parachinar, Tari Mangal, Aryob, Tsamkani, Khandkhel, Gardez, Zurmat, Sharana, Zerok, Urgun, Angur Ada, Kaniguram, and Razmak. Nonetheless, frosts are still frequent in the early mornings.

Most unusually for Afghanistan, Khost receives a substantial proportion of its annual rainfall of from the South Asian monsoon. The valley being open to the southeast (towards the lower elevation Miranshah), the moisture-laden winds bring much welcomed rain during the summer. The remaining portion of the year Khost remains hot and dry. Sporadic droughts occur when the summer monsoon fails to bring the needed precipitation.

===Land use===
Khost is the provincial administrative seat in eastern Afghanistan. Being close to the border with Pakistan, Khost straddles an important transport corridor. The eastern districts (1‚Äì3) are dotted with forests and residential settlements while the western districts (4‚Äì5) are more barren and lightly populated. Water courses account for 5% of total land surface.

==History==
=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

During the Second Anglo-Afghan War, British forces led by Lord Roberts entered Khost during the second British invasion of Afghanistan during the conflict. Approximately 8,000 raiders from the Mangal tribe, which had a long tradition of resisting outside control, launched several attacks on weakly protected British supply convoys in Khost. In reprisal, Lord Roberts ordered his forces to attack eleven Mangal villages which had launched raids that murdered several camp followers, resulting in them being sacked and burnt. Once news of the reprisals became known in Britain, his political opponents in the British Parliament criticized Lord Roberts&#x27; actions. At the end of the conflict, British forces withdrew from Khost.

==== Khost rebellions ====

Between 1856 and 1925, Khost was the site of three rebellions, lasting from 1856 to 1857, 1912, and 1924‚Äì1925 respectively. 

During the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, Khost was the object of a siege that lasted for more than eight years. Soon after the invasion of Afghanistan by Soviet troops, Afghan guerillas took control of the only land route between Khost and Gardez, effectively putting a stop to the Soviet advance.

During the assault on the Zhawar Kili Cave complex, the Soviets used the Khost Airfield as an initial staging ground to insert troops into the combat zone, using Mil Mi-8 armed helicopter transport ships.

As of April 1995, Khost was under the control of the Taliban.

===21st century===
During the war in Afghanistan (2001‚Äì2021), the United States built Forward Operating Base Chapman near Khost. Due to its location in southeastern Afghanistan, it was a hotbed for insurgent activity attempting to dislodge the American forces there. Like most other provinces, Khost is home to maneuver forces and a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). Maneuver forces wage war against insurgents and assist the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police in operations, while the PRT handles the reconstruction aspects.

In early 2007, Lieutenant Colonel Scottie Custer of the 82nd Airborne Division saw that the best way to limit insurgent activity in Khost was to forward-deploy some 187 paratroopers under his command to Force Protection Facilities in Khost&#x27;s various district centers around sub-governors&#x27; mansions, to directly protect these, maintain a visible presence in population centers, and help mentor Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police units operating across Khost.

The FPFs brought a broader sense of security and prosperity to surrounding areas. Bazaars, shops, and gas stations have improved the quality of life for local residents. The Mandozai Force Protection Facilities in Khost include a medical clinic attached to further assist Afghans in need of basic medical assistance. The offices of Khost&#x27;s various sub-governors had experienced an increased activity as Afghans went there to settle disputes and voice concerns instead of going through traditional tribal channels and bribes, cutting down on sectarian suspicion and strife.

Throughout 2007 and 2008, roads had been improved, businesses were springing up and schools were being built, at least 50 in 2007 alone with another 25 planned for 2008. A new airport was under construction as the Khost Airfield was used by the US Military, creating new opportunities and jobs. The Provincial Reconstruction Team, led by CDR David Adams was instrumental in connecting the people to the government in Khost City, by ensuring the PRT was able to execute over $2.5 million under the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP).

On 12 May 2009, several teams of armed militants stormed Khost, prompting a heavy 6-hour battle with US and Afghan National Army forces. Reportedly the attack involved 10 suicide bombers, of whom seven were able to detonate and three were shot by security forces. Coalition Forces, aided by the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, took the lead in repelling the attack.

On 20 November 2009 a bomb killed 3 civilians and wounded 3 others as a car hit a roadside bomb in Khost City. According to the chief of criminal investigation the act was perpetrated by the Taliban.

On 24 November 2009, according to the Afghan Ministry of Interior, 6 people, including 5 children were killed when a remote control bomb attacked a water station in Khost which had been built by the Rural Rehabilitation Ministry to distribute water to the locals.

On 30 December 2009, a suicide bomber attacked Forward Operating Base Chapman, a major CIA base in Khost, and killed seven CIA officers, including the chief of the base.

On 18 February 2011, a suicide car bomber targeted a police checkpoint and killed 11 people.

On 14 July 2011, according to a spokesman for the provincial government, NATO ground troops killed six civilians in a night raid of the village of Toora Worai, in an area known as Matoon, about seven kilometres from the Khost provincial capital of Khost city.

On 15 August 2021, Khost was seized by Taliban fighters, becoming the twenty-eighth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban as part of the wider 2021 Taliban offensive.

At least 29 people died in Khost during the June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake.

==Demographics==
The urban population of the city of Khost is 106,083 (in 2015), mostly Pashtun (mainly from the tribes of Zadran, Mangal, Zazi, Tani, Gurbuz, Muqbal, Sabari, Banusi and Wazir), living in 11,787 dwellings, arranged in six municipal districts.

Khost has a population of 511,600 people in 2008. In the province, there are 87,199 households, with an average of eight individuals per home. Rural districts are home to 98 percent of the population. Pashtuns are the province&#x27;s most populous ethnic group. Zadran, Mangal, Mandozi, Ismaiel Khil, Tani, Gubuz, Matoon, Lakan, Jaji, Sabari, Alishir Terizi, and Babakker Khil are among the prominent tribes. There is a small population of Pamiris as well. Kuchis (nomads) live in Khost province, and their numbers fluctuate depending on the season. 75 percent of the 104,965 Kuchis living in Khost are long-distance migratory, while 25% are settled. Over half of the colony of long-distance migratory Kuchis migrates from a winter to a summer location. In the winter, an estimated 74,179 people cross the border, bringing Khost&#x27;s Kuchi population to 179,144, making it the country&#x27;s second-largest Kuchi province (after Nangarhar). 

==Sports==

The three most popular sports in Khost, Afghanistan are cricket (86%), basketball (19%) and football (11%).

Cricket is growing in popularity in Khost, with the sport being introduced by newly returned refugees from Pakistan. Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, and batsman Noor Ali, as well as Nawroz Mangal, the former captain of Afghanistan Cricket Team hail from Khost. Dawlat Zadran, the Afghan Cricket paceman who grabbed two crucial wickets against Pakistan (in 1st International One Day against Full Member), is also from Khost.

In football, Khost and the surrounding region is represented by De Abasin Sape F.C, in the Afghan Premier League.

As a result of its being a major railway hub, it has become a major built up area in southern Osaka. The buildings around the station include, the Kintetsu department store, Mio, Station Plaza, and Hoop shopping malls, Apollo Movie Theater and Lucias shopping mall, as well as the more recent Q&#x27;s Mall. In addition, there are several shopping streets in the area including Abenobashisuji. The Kintetsu Abeno Harukas building, which houses the Kintetsu department store, was fully opened in the spring of 2014 and is currently the tallest building in Japan at 300 meters (984¬†ft.) in height.

<doc id="400074" wikidata="Q6794139" url="?curid=400074" title="Maven (Scrabble)">
<text>Maven is an artificial intelligence Scrabble player, created by Brian Sheppard in 1986. It is no longer commercially available, the rights having been bought by Hasbro in 1996. It has been used in official licensed Hasbro Scrabble games since then. 

==Algorithms==

===Game phases===
Maven&#x27;s gameplay is sub-divided into three phases: The &quot;mid-game&quot; phase, the &quot;pre-endgame&quot; phase, and the &quot;endgame&quot; phase.

The &quot;mid-game&quot; phase lasts from the beginning of the game up until there are nine or fewer tiles left in the bag. The program uses a rapid algorithm to find all possible plays from the given rack, and then part of the program called the &quot;kibitzer&quot; uses simple heuristics to sort them into rough order of quality. The most promising moves are then evaluated by &quot;simming&quot;, in which the program simulates the random drawing of tiles, plays forward a set number of plays, and compares the points spread of the moves&#x27; outcomes. By simulating thousands of random drawings, the program can give a very accurate quantitative evaluation of the different plays. (While a Monte Carlo search, Maven does not use Monte Carlo tree search because it evaluates game trees only 2-ply deep, rather than playing out to the end of the game, and does not reallocate rollouts to more promising branches for deeper exploration; in reinforcement learning terminology, the Maven search strategy might be considered &quot;truncated Monte Carlo simulation&quot;. A true MCTS strategy is unnecessary because the endgame can be solved. The shallow search is because the Maven author argues that, due to the fast turnover of letters in one&#x27;s bag, it is typically not useful to look more than 2-ply deep, because if one instead looked deeper, e.g. 4-ply, the variance of rewards will be larger and the simulations will take several times longer, while only helping in a few exotic situations: &quot;We maintain that if it requires an extreme situation like CACIQUE to see the value of a four-ply simulation then they are not worth doing.&quot; As the board value can be evaluated with very high accuracy in Scrabble, unlike games such as Go, deeper simulations are unlikely to change the initial evaluation.)

The &quot;pre-endgame&quot; phase works in almost the same way as the &quot;mid-game&quot; phase, except that it is designed to attempt to yield a good end-game situation.

The &quot;endgame&quot; phase takes over as soon as there are no tiles left in the bag. In two-player games, this means that the players can now deduce from the initial letter distribution the exact tiles on each other&#x27;s racks. Maven uses the B-star search algorithm to analyze the game tree during the endgame phase.

===Move generation===
Maven has used several algorithms for move generation, but the one that has stuck is the DAWG algorithm. The GADDAG algorithm is faster, but a DAWG for North American English is only 0.5 MB, compared to about 2.5 MB for a GADDAG. That makes a significant difference for download games, whereas the speed advantage is not important. (Note that unimportant does not mean that the difference is small, merely that users cannot tell the difference. The GADDAG is perhaps twice as fast, but both algorithms are fast enough.)

===Rack evaluation===
The first (1986) version of Maven used a set of about 100 patterns to value racks. Every single tile had a value (27 patterns). Each duplicate had a value (22 patterns). There were patterns for triplicates and quads for letters that have enough representation in the bag. Finally, the QU combination was a pattern.

Soon after the first version, Maven acquired rack evaluation terms for vowel/consonant balance and Q/U distribution. Vowel/consonant balance was a table lookup based on the count of vowels and consonants left in the rack. Q/U distribution varied the values of Q and U using a table lookup indexed by how many of each remained in the bag.

Shortly thereafter, Maven acquired a tile duplication evaluator. The idea was to vary a rack depending on the chance of drawing duplicates. For example, A is generally better than I as a tile, but if there are 7 A&#x27;s and only 2 I&#x27;s left in the bag, then maybe we should prefer to keep the I.

Parameter fitting was accomplished by tuning the values to predict the total of future scores. Nowadays this would be called Temporal Difference Learning.

This rack evaluation design was original to Maven. It was very successful in competing with the human champions of the day.

The design was later extended by other researchers. Mark Watkins championed what he called &quot;tile synergy patterns.&quot; These are combination like ADES which form the basis of many high-scoring words. This is a natural extension of the design, which does significantly improve play. Maven&#x27;s pattern set gradually expanded from the base set of 100 to well over 400.

Maven has since switched to a completely different architecture, proposed by John O&#x27;Laughlin and implemented in Quackle. This is the &quot;exhaustive&quot; architecture, where the program has a different rack evaluation parameter for each of the 3 million possible combinations of 0 to 7 tiles. With the advances in computer power over the last decade, it has become possible to tune such large parameter sets.

The downside of using an exhaustive approach is that Maven lost the ability to vary evaluations as a function of the tiles that remained in the bag. The point is that the exhaustive rack evaluator does not have terms that relate a rack&#x27;s value to the possible draws from the bag.

Maven&#x27;s version of exhaustive rack evaluation has added that ability. In Maven, each rack has its own liner evaluator, where the value of that rack varies as a function of the chance of drawing a duplicate, the chance of drawing a vowel, and the chance of drawing Q and U. This system has 5 parameters per rack, for about 15 million parameters in all.

===Simulation===
The great human champion Ron Tiekert had studied Scrabble by playing out individual positions dozens of times, and tabulating results. He suggested that with Maven&#x27;s speed, it should be possible to automate that process in overnight runs. Brian Sheppard named this process &quot;simulation&quot;, though it goes by the name &quot;rollout&quot; in backgammon, and &quot;playout&quot; in Go.

The process was to select N candidate moves using the score+rack heuristic. Then play out those moves hundreds or thousands of times to see which candidate performs best. You can vary the depth of the playout to suit your purpose; play two or four moves ahead to get a good idea about point differential, or play to the end of the game to measure winning chances.

By the mid-1990s, computers had become fast enough that Maven used simulation to choose moves in competitive games under tournament time controls. Algorithmic improvements were important to scaling simulation for this purpose. The most important innovation was to vary the number of trials given to candidates so that more successful candidates receive more effort. It was also helpful to control the racks so that all candidate moves were sampled against the same, unbiased distribution.

Analysis of games played by Maven&#x27;s simulation engine suggest that Maven has surpassed the skill level of human champions.

===Endgame===
Strong play in Scrabble endgames is much harder than it looks. In theory, endgames are a game of perfect information, so the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm should work. But in practice Alpha Beta works badly on Scrabble.

The problem with Alpha Beta is that some Scrabble endgames require 14 moves to play out, and it is not possible to search that deeply. This is not merely a theoretical possibility. When one player is &quot;stuck&quot; with a tile, then playing out all remaining tiles is impossible. In that situation the optimal strategy for both sides is usually to play one tile on each turn.

Maven uses a different approach. The B* search algorithm is a selective-depth, progressive-widening algorithm that guarantees to find optimal solutions to two-player games when one can compute upper and lower bounds on the values of each position.

It turns out that it is possible to estimate upper and lower bounds on endgame positions. These bounds are correct (that is, the true value lies within the interval) for the overwhelming majority of positions. Since B* is reasonably robust in the presence of a small percentage of error in the bounds, Maven can solve endgames that other approaches cannot.

A further refinement makes Maven&#x27;s endgame solutions asymptotically optimal even in the presence of errors. When the B* search terminates with a proof that one move is best, and there is still time remaining, then Maven widens its estimates by 1 point and searches again. These re-searches are usually very quick, because the tree from the previous search is still largely valid. Repeated use of this policy will progressively identify errors, starting with the smallest (and presumably most likely) errors.

===Exhaustive pre-endgame===
When only 1 or 2 tiles remain in the bag (&quot;PEG-1&quot; or &quot;PEG-2&quot;), it is possible to perform exhaustive searches of the state space.

The case of a PEG-1 is important, because almost half of all games pass through that state. Maven can play out such states exhaustively in almost all cases. That is, for all legal moves Maven can play out the resulting endgames (up to 8 for each legal move), and calculate which side will win the game in each case. Because there are some situations (e.g., two blanks, stuck-with-Q) that require extra effort, the calculation is performed progressively. That is, Maven expands its analysis first where the decision is close and relevant.

In a PEG-2 it is normally not possible to exhaustively examine all move sequences, so Maven goes as far as it can in the time available.

One feature of these low-tile situations is that it is very hard to safely prune the list of legal moves. For example, the optimal play is ranked behind more than 50 other moves by the score+rack heuristic more than 1% of the time.

This policy does not produce play that is theoretically perfect, because it is impossible to know what the true initial distribution of unseen tiles should be. Assuming a uniform distribution does well, and it is possible to calculate inferences about unseen tiles that marginally improves on that assumption.

Another limitation is that Maven is not addressing the &quot;hidden information&quot; aspect of such situations. That is, in theory there are situations where players maximize expectation by randomly choosing moves according to a probability distribution. Maven is choosing pure strategies at each node.

<text>Maxine Koran Klibingaitis (17 May 1964 ‚Äì 17 April 2023) was an Australian actress, notable for her roles in TV soap operas and serials. She is best known for her roles in &quot;Prisoner&quot;, as Bobbie Mitchell, and in &quot;Neighbours&quot;, as Terry Inglis.

==Personal life== 
Klibingaitis was born in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia on 17 May 1964. In 1987, Klibingaitis married Australian director Andrew Friedman. They have one son, Zane Friedman.

==Career==
Klibingaitis is most notable for her role in the cult drama soap opera, &quot;Prisoner&quot; (known internationally as &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;), from 1983 to 1985, as rebellious teen punk, Bobbie Mitchell. During her stint on the series, Klibingaitis&#x27; character was involved in several dramatic story arcs, including shoplifting, escaping custody, kidnapping, prostitution, miscarriage and a suicide attempt, before being eventually paroled and becoming engaged to be married. She returned in a guest appearance for a wedding storyline. Klibingaitis attended a 40th anniversary reunion event for &quot;Prisoner&quot; in February 2019 and a special event hosted by Ken Mulholland and Matt Batten of the website Talking Prisoner, in August 2022.

She was cast in the regular role of Terry Inglis on Melbourne-based soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot; during 1985, in which the character, an apprentice plumber, married Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), before committing murder, then attempting to kill Paul by shooting him, leading to her incarceration and demise by committing suicide. Terry&#x27;s death, which happened off-screen, attracted controversy, as the subject of suicide was not a common topic covered in an early evening program, and was the only character on the show to die in this way.

Klibingaitis&#x27; only other leading role in a television series, was that of Sophie Verstak in the short-lived comedy, &quot;Hampton Court&quot; in 1991, a spin-off from the popular sitcom, &quot;Hey Dad..!&quot;. Her additional TV credits include, &quot;Special Squad&quot;, &quot;Fields of Fire&quot;, &quot;The Flying Doctor&quot;, &quot;Home and Away&quot;, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; and &quot;Round the Twist&quot;.

She made her film debut in 1989, appearing in James Ricketson&#x27;s &quot;Candy Regentag&quot;, before going onto roles as a regular in Timothy Spanos films and short form series including &quot;Prisoner Queen: Mindless Music &amp; Mirrorballs&quot;, &quot;Mondo Maniacs&quot;, which earned her a MUFF Award for Best Supporting Female Actor at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival, &quot;Boronia Boys&quot; and the spin off, &quot;Boronia Backpackers&quot;.

In May 2022, Klibingaitis appeared in an episode of the podcast &quot;Yarn About You&quot;.

==Death==
Klibingaitis died suddenly and unexpectedly in Melbourne, Australia on 17 April 2023 at the age of 58. No cause was specified.

<text>Sheng Shicai (; 3 December 189513 July 1970) was a Chinese warlord who ruled Xinjiang from 1933 to 1944. Sheng&#x27;s rise to power started with a coup d&#x27;√©tat in 1933 when he was appointed the &quot;duban&quot; (Military Governor) of Xinjiang. The Soviet era ended in 1942, when Sheng approached the Nationalist Chinese government, but still retained much power over the province. He was dismissed from this post in 1944 and named Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. Growing animosity against him led the government to dismiss him again and appoint him to a military post. At the end of the Chinese Civil War, Sheng fled mainland China to Taiwan with the rest of the Kuomintang.

Sheng Shicai was a Manchurian-born Han Chinese, educated in Tokyo, Japan, where he studied political economy and later attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. Having become a Marxist in his youth, Sheng participated in the anti-imperialist May Fourth Movement in 1919. He participated in the Northern Expedition, a military campaign of the Kuomintang against the Beiyang government.

In 1929, he was called into service of the Governor of Xinjiang, Jin Shuren, where he served as Chief of Staff of the Frontier Military and Chief Instructor at the Provincial Military College. With the Kumul Rebellion ongoing, Jin was overthrown in a coup on 12 April 1933 and Sheng was appointed &quot;duban&quot; or Military Governor of Xinjiang. Since then, he led a power struggle against his rivals, of whom Ma Zhongying and Zhang Peiyuan were most notable. The first to be removed were the coup leaders and by them appointed Civil Governor Liu Wenlong by September 1933. Ma and Zhang were defeated militarily by June 1934 with help from the Soviet Union, whom Sheng invited to intervene, subordinating himself to the Soviets in return. He was dubbed the &quot;King of Xinjiang&quot; during his rule.

As ruler of Xinjiang, Sheng implemented his Soviet-inspired policies through his political program of Six Great Policies, adopted in December 1934. His rule was marked by his nationality policy which promoted national and religious equality and identity of various nationalities of Xinjiang. The province saw a process of modernization, but also the subordination of economic interests in Soviet favor. The Soviets had a monopoly over Xinjiang trade and exploited its rare materials and oil. In 1937, in parallel with the Soviet Great Purge, Sheng conducted a purge on his own, executing, torturing to death and imprisoning 100,000 people, the majority of which were Uyghurs.

With the Soviets distracted by its war with Germany, Sheng approached the Chinese government in July 1942 and expelled the Soviet military and technical personnel. However, he still maintained effective power over Xinjiang. In the meantime, the Soviets managed to hold off the Germans and the Japanese launched an extensive offensive against the Chinese, which led Sheng to try to change sides again by arresting the Kuomintang officials and invoking Soviet intervention for the second time in 1944. The Soviets ignored the request and the Chinese government removed him from the post naming him Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in August 1944.

Sheng held the ministerial post by July 1945 and later worked as an adviser to Hu Zongnan and held a military post. He joined the rest of the Kuomintang in Taiwan after the defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. In Taiwan, Sheng lived in a comfortable retirement and died in Taipei in 1970.

== Early life ==

Sheng, an ethnic Han Chinese, was born in Kaiyuan, Manchuria in a well-to-do peasant family on 3 December 1895. His great grandfather, Sheng Fuxin(ÁõõÁ¶è‰ø°), was originally from Shandong Province and later fled to Kaiyuan. Sheng enrolled at the Provincial Forestry and Agricultural School in Mukden, aged 14. Aged 17, Sheng enrolled at the Wusong Public School in Shanghai, where he studied political science and economy. There, he became friendly with students and teachers of &quot;radical inclinations&quot;. After graduating in 1915, under their advice he went to study in Tokyo, Japan. There, Sheng enrolled at the Waseda University, where he studied political economy for a year. During that time, Sheng expressed nationalistic attitudes and was exposed to &quot;The ABC of Communism&quot; () and other leftist publications.

Unrest in China made him return to homeland. In 1919, he participated in the May Fourth Movement as a representative of the Liaoning students. During this period, he developed radical and anti-Japanese sentiments. By his own admission, Sheng became a Marxist the very same year and his political opponents claimed he became a communist during his second stay in Japan in the 1920s. During that time, he realised the &quot;futility of book learning&quot;, and decided to enter a military career. He took military training in the southern province of Kwantung, known for liberal and reformist views. Later, he enrolled at the Northeastern Military Academy.

Sheng entered military service under Guo Songling, Deputy of Zhang Zuolin, a Manchurian warlord. He rapidly rose to become Staff Officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was given command of a company. Because of his commendable service, Guo sponsored his admission to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy for advanced military studies. Three years later he completed his studies, with minor interruptions in 1925, when he was involved in Manchurian politics.

At that time, Sheng supported a campaign against Zhang, briefly returning to Manchuria. Although he supported the anti-Zhang coup, he was able to return to Japan with the support of Feng Yuxiang and Chiang Kai-Shek, from whom he received financial help and considered him as his patron.

Sheng returned from Japan in 1927 to participate in the Northern Expedition A rising young officer, Sheng was given the rank of colonel and served as a Staff Officer of the Chiang&#x27;s field headquarters under He Yingqin. During the Northern Expedition, Sheng proved himself as a worthy officer, serving in various command staff capacities.

Sheng was a member of the Guominjun, a leftist nationalist faction that supported the Nationalist government in China. However, Sheng did not join the Kuomintang because of his belief in Marxism. After the Expedition was completed, he was made chief of the war operations section of the general staff in Nanjing, but resigned in 1929 over a disagreement with his superiors. After the apparent setback in his career, Sheng dedicated himself to the question of strengthening China&#x27;s border defences.

== Power struggle ==

=== Rise to power ===

Not long after Sheng&#x27;s resignation, a delegation from Xinjiang came to Nanjing to ask for financial aid. The Governor of Xinjiang Jin Shuren asked one of the members of the delegation, the Deputy General Secretary of Xinjiang Guang Lu, to find a competent officer to reorganise the provincial military. After discreet enquiries, Sheng was appointed to Jin&#x27;s staff and arrived in Xinjiang via Soviet Union in the winter of 1929‚Äì30. Chiang Kai-Shek may have endorsed Sheng&#x27;s decision to go to Xinjiang. Therefore, the appointment of Ma Zhongying, Sheng&#x27;s rival, as a commander of the 36th Division in Xinjiang embarrassed and frustrated Sheng. Sheng&#x27;s welcome in Xinjiang was cold. Jin considered him a potential threat. Despite the doubts, Jin appointed him Chief of Staff of the Frontier Army and subsequently named him Chief Instructor at the Provincial Military College.

In the summer of 1932, the fighting between Ma and Jin had significantly intensified. Ma&#x27;s Hui forces were able to break the defence lines at Hami and enter Xinjiang through the Hexi Corridor. In December 1932, Ma&#x27;s forces started the siege of √úr√ºmqi, but the White Russians and Sheng&#x27;s troops successfully defended the city. In March 1933, the Manchurian Salvation Army, part of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), came to their aid through the Soviet territory. During these events, Jin&#x27;s prestige declined and correspondingly Sheng became increasingly popular. The culmination was the coup staged by the White Russians and a group of provincial bureaucrats led by Chen Zhong, Tao Mingyue and Li Xiaotian on 12 April 1933, who overthrew Jin, who escaped to China proper via Siberia.

Sheng, who was marshalling the provincial forces in eastern Xinjiang, returned to √úr√ºmqi to seize power in the midst of the chaos. Without conferring the Chinese government, the coup leaders appointed Sheng the Commissioner of the Xinjiang Border Defence, i. e., Military Governor or &quot;duban&quot; on 14 April 1933, resurrecting the old title. Liu Wenlong, a powerless provincial bureaucrat was installed as the Civil Governor.

=== Rivalry with Ma and Zhang ===

Sheng&#x27;s appointment as &quot;duban&quot; did not mean that his position was secured. Installment of Wenlong as governor meant that the bureaucrats had the upper hand over Sheng, whom they considered their protege. His position was also challenged by Ma, as well as Zhang Peiyuan, Jin&#x27;s old ally and a commander of the Yining region. The Chinese government, having learned that Zhang refused to cooperate with the new regime in Xinjiang and that Ma&#x27;s forces represented the gravest threat to the new regime, tried to take the advantage of the situation and take control over the province. Without clearly stating whether it recognized the changes in Xinjiang, the government appointed Huang Musong, then a Deputy Chief of General Staff, a &quot;pacification commissioner&quot; in May 1933. He arrived in √úr√ºmqi on 10 June. The appointment of Huang as a pacification commissioner further strained the relations between Shang and the Chinese government.

Sheng expected that the Chinese government would recognise him as &quot;duban&quot;, and that Huang&#x27;s visit would affect that decision. Huang was ignorant of the frontier problems and his arrogant behaviour offended some of the provincial leaders. The rumours spread that Huang was already named a new governor or that Chiang decided to split Xinjiang into several smaller provinces. However, the true Huang&#x27;s task was to secure the cooperation between the coup leaders and establish a new provincial mechanism with a pro-Nanjing stance. Sheng exploited the rumours and charged that Huang, an agent of Wang Jingwei had plotted with Liu, Zhang and Ma to overthrow the provincial government. On 26 June Huang was placed under house arrest, and the three coup leaders were also arrested and immediately executed. After the Chinese government apologised and promised Sheng the recognition of his position, Huang was allowed to return to Nanjing three weeks after the arrest.

Shortly afterwards, in August Chiang sent Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, as a sign of goodwill, to preside over Sheng&#x27;s inauguration ceremony as a Commissioner of the Xinjiang Border Defence. However, at the same time, the Chinese government used Luo&#x27;s visit to contact two of Sheng&#x27;s rivals, Ma in Turpan and Zhang in Yining. They were encouraged to launch an attack against Sheng. As soon as Luo left the province, a war broke out between Sheng on one side, and Ma and Zhang on the other. Sheng accused Luo not only for plotting but also of an assassination attempt. Luo&#x27;s left Xinjiang in early October, and his departure marked the beginning of the era of deep alienation between Sheng and the Chinese government.

In September 1933, Sheng accused Civil Governor Liu Wenlong of plotting with Ma and Zhang through Luo with Nanjing in order to overthrow him. He was forced to resign and was replaced by Zhu Ruichi, a more controllable official. Sheng created a new bureaucratic hierarchy, nepotistically appointing new officials and replacing one of his predecessors.

Confronted by Ma&#x27;s army outside of √úr√ºmqi, Sheng sent a delegation to Soviet Central Asia to request assistance. Sheng later claimed that the delegation was sent under the aegis of Jin&#x27;s request for military equipment. However, Sheng made a more comprehensive deal with the Soviets. His delegation returned in December 1933, together with Garegin Apresov, who would later be appointed as the Soviet General Consul in √úr√ºmqi. The Soviets provided substantive military assistance to Sheng, who in return gave the Soviets wide political, economic and military control over Xinjiang.

Ma sieged √úr√ºmqi for the second time in January 1934. This time, the Soviets assisted Sheng with air support and two brigades of the Joint State Political Directorate. With their aid, Sheng again defeated Ma&#x27;s forces, who retreated south from Tien Shan, in a region controlled by the East Turkestan Republic (ETR). The same month, Ma&#x27;s forces arrived in Kashgar, extinguishing the ETR. Hoja-Niyaz, president of the ETR escaped upon the arrival of Ma&#x27;s troops to the Xinjiang-Soviet border, and in town Irkeshtam signed an agreement that abolished the East Turkestan Republic and supported Sheng&#x27;s regime. In early 1934, Zhu Ruichi died and was replaced by Li Rong as Civil Governor.

In January, the Chinese government approved Huang Shaohong&#x27;s plan for military operation in Xinjiang, in order to put the province under its effective control. Huang had in mind to act pragmatically, offering support either to Sheng or Ma, whoever was willing to cooperate with the Chinese government. The pretext for the operation was the development of Xinjiang and adjacent provinces. For that purpose, the Xinjiang Construction Planning Office was established in Xinjiang with Huang in charge. With enthusiasm from the Minister of Finance H. H. Kung, Huang purchased foreign-manufactured armored vehicles. By April, the preparations reached their final stage. However, the whole plan came to a halt in May because the Soviets have already entered Xinjiang and assisted Sheng against Ma.

Under pressure from Sheng&#x27;s strengthened military forces, Ma&#x27;s troops retreated from Kashgar in June‚ÄìJuly 1934 to the southeast towards Hotan and Yarkand, where they remained until 1937. Ma himself retreated via Irkeshtam to Soviet Central Asia, accompanied by several officers and a Soviet official. Sheng sent requests to the Soviets to turn him in, but they refused. By this move, the Soviets intended to achieve dual benefits. First, by removing Ma from Xinjiang&#x27;s political arena, they wanted to increase Sheng&#x27;s rule, which would give them higher control over the province; and second, they intended to use Ma as leverage against Sheng in case he did not comply with their interests in the province. The armistice between the Hui forces and the Xinjiang government was agreed upon in September 1934. Zhang, after suffering defeat, committed suicide.

Following the withdrawal of the Hui forces to Hotan in July 1934, Ma Hushan consolidated his power over the remote oases of the Tarim Basin, thus establishing a Hui satrapy, where Hui Muslims ruled as colonial masters over their Turkic Muslim subjects. The region was named Tunganistan by Walther Heissig. Tunganistan was bordering on two, eventually, three sides with Xinjiang province, and on the fourth side bordered the Tibetan Plateau. Despite the fact that negotiations were underway with the command of the 36th Division, the Dungan command did not make concessions on any issues. Moreover, the Soviets, intending to keep the 36th Division as a fallback against Sheng, vacillated regarding the complete annihilation of the 36th Division, giving refuge to the Dungan commanders and establishing trade relations with the 36th Division.

== Rule ==

=== Consolidation ===

On the anniversary of the 12 April coup in 1934, the Xinjiang provincial government published an administrative plan called the &quot;Great Eight-Point Manifesto&quot; or &quot;Eight Great Proclamations&quot;. These included: the establishment of racial equality, guarantee of religious freedom, equitable distribution of agricultural and rural relief, reform of government finance, the cleaning up of government administration, the expansion of education, the promotion of self-government and the improvement of the judiciary. The program was practicable since each point represented a grievance that one nationality had against the previous government, which enabled Sheng to enact the reforms. The first two points which dealt with &quot;the realisation of equality for all nationalities&quot; and &quot;the protection of the rights of believers&quot; advanced the national and religious rights of the Xinjiang nationalities.

Sheng sent a letter to Joseph Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov and Kliment Voroshilov in June 1934. In the letter, Sheng expressed his belief in the victory of Communism and referred to himself as &quot;convinced supporter of Communism&quot;. He called for the &quot;fastest possible implementation of Communism in Xinjiang&quot;. Sheng also not only denounced the Nationalist government, but expressed his aim in overthrowing it, suggesting support for the Chinese Soviet Republic and joint offensive against the Chinese government. Sheng also expressed his wish to join the Communist Party of Soviet Union. In a letter sent to the Soviet General Consul Garegin Apresov in √úr√ºmqi, Stalin commented that the Sheng&#x27;s letter made a &quot;depressing impression on our comrades&quot;. The content of Sheng&#x27;s letter led Stalin to refer him as &quot;a provocateur or a hopeless &quot;leftist&quot; having no idea about Marxism&quot;. In a reply to Sheng, Stalin, Molotov and Voroshilov refused all of his proposals.

In August 1934, Sheng affirmed that the nine duties of his government are to eradicate corruption, to develop economy and culture, to maintain peace by avoiding war, to mobilise all manpower for the cultivation of land, to improve communication facilities, to keep Xinjiang permanently a Chinese province, to fight against imperialism and Fascism and to sustain a close relationship with Soviet Russia, to reconstruct a &quot;New Xinjiang&quot;, and to protect the positions and privileges of religious leaders.

The dependency of the Sheng regime on the Soviet Union was further highlighted with the publication of the &quot;Six Great Policies&quot; in December 1934. The Policies guaranteed his previously enacted &quot;Great Eight-Point Manifesto&quot; and included &quot;anti-imperialism, friendship with the Soviet Union, racial and national equality, clean government, peace and reconstruction&quot;. Sheng referred to them as &quot;a skillful, vital application of Marxism, Leninism, and Stalinism in the conditions of the feudal society of economically and culturally backward Xinjiang&quot;. They served as the ideological basis of Sheng&#x27;s rule. With the proclamation of the Six Great Policies, Sheng adopted a new flag with a six-pointed star to represent these policies.

On 1 August 1935, Sheng founded the People&#x27;s Anti-Imperialist Association in √úr√ºmqi. Garegin Apresov submitted a presentation to the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union which accepted the creation of the association on 5 August. The association had to be composed of representatives of the Soviet special services bodies. As the leader of the association, Sheng became one of the main figures of Soviet regional policy. The creation of the association strengthened the Soviet position in Xinjiang.

The propaganda of the association was the &quot;Anti-Imperialist War Front&quot;. Xinjiang&#x27;s Youth and Xinjiang&#x27;s Women served as the association&#x27;s youth and women&#x27;s wing respectively. In 1935, the association had 2,489 members, and in 1939, the Association&#x27;s membership rose to 10,000. The membership was nationally diverse, and included Han, Hui and various Turkic peoples.

In 1935 the British consul in Kashgar sent a report to the Foreign Office which stated that the influence of the Soviet Union on Xinjiang and its population increased. In order to check the reliability of these claims, the Chinese government sent a special commission to √úr√ºmqi. However, the commission concluded that Soviet assistance is friendly and commensurate with the assistance previously provided to the province by the Soviet Union. Only after this, the governments of Xinjiang, China, and the Soviet Union issued a joint statement in which the allegedly impending annexation of Xinjiang to the USSR was characterised as untrue. Sheng and the &quot;reliable people&quot; he appointed in the province played a special role in the fact that the Chinese authorities came to this conclusion. After this joint statement, the Soviet Union felt even more comfortable in Xinjiang politics. In 1935 the Politburo made several secret decisions to strengthen Soviet influence in the region.

When in December 1936 Zhang Xueliang rebelled against the Chinese government and arrested Chiang Kai-shek, which led to the Xi&#x27;an Incident. Sheng sided with Zhang, who asked for his help, and intended to proclaim that his rebels were under Xinjiang&#x27;s protection. Only after the Soviets condemned the incident and characterised it as a Japanese provocation, and demanded from Sheng to drop his support for Zhang, did Sheng refuse to support Zhang.

=== Kashgar region and Islamic Rebellion ===

Two weeks after Ma Zhongying left for the Soviet territory, in early July 1934, Kashgar was occupied by a unit of 400 Chinese soldiers under the command of Kung Cheng-han on 20 July. He was accompanied by the 2,000 strong Uighurs commanded by Mahmut Muhiti, a wealthy ex-merchant. Thus, Kashgar was peacefully taken over by Xinjiang&#x27;s provincial authority after almost a year.

To reassure the local population and to give himself additional time to consolidate his power in the northern and eastern parts of the province, Sheng appointed Muhiti as the overall Military Commander for the Kashgar region. Sheng was not comfortable with the Muslim officials in Kashgar, therefore a month later, he appointed his fellow Manchurian Liu Pin to the position of Commanding Officer in Kashgar. Muhiti was demoted and retained the position of Divisional Commander.

Sheng&#x27;s Han Chinese appointees took effective control over the Kashgar region, and foremost amongst them was Liu, a Chinese nationalist, and a Christian. Liu understood little about the local Muslim culture. Immediately upon his arrival, he ordered that the picture of Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Chinese Republic, be hung in the Kashgar mosque. The local Muslim population was dismayed by the developments in Kashgar and considered that the &quot;Bolsheviks had taken over the country and were bent on destroying religion&quot;. Also Sheng&#x27;s educational reform which attacked basic Islamic principles, as well as atheistic propaganda, contributed to the alienation of the Xinjiang&#x27;s Muslim population.

Also in 1936, in the Altay region in northern Xinjiang, local Muslim nationalists, led by Younis Haji, founded the Society of National Defence. This society included influential Muslim figures. Sheng received information on the preparation of a powerful protest movement by this society. However, he did not have the capacity to suppress this movement with his own forces.

In Afghanistan, Muhammad Amin Bughra, the exiled leader of the East Turkestan Republic, approached the Japanese ambassador in 1935 proposing the establishment of the ETR under Japanese patronage and proposed Mahmut Muhiti as the leader of the newly established puppet state. The plan was later aborted when Mahmud in fear for his life fled from Kashgar to British India in April 1937.

Muhiti became the focal point of the opposition to Sheng&#x27;s government. From the middle of 1936, he and his supporters began to propagate the idea of creating an &quot;independent Uyghur state&quot;. In this case, he was supported by Muslim religious leaders and influential people from Xinjiang. Muhiti, having entered into contact with the Soviet consul in Kashgar Smirnov, even tried to get weapons from the Soviet Union, but his appeal was rejected. Then, by contacting former Dungan opponents, in early April 1937, Muhiti was able to raise an uprising against the Xinjiang authorities. However, only two regiments of the 6th Uyghur Division, stationed north and south of Kashgar in Artush and Yengihissar, came out in his defence, while the other two regiments, 33rd and 34th, stationed in Kashgar itself, declared their loyalty to the Sheng&#x27;s government.

Urged by the Soviets, Sheng&#x27;s government sent a peacekeeping mission to Kashgar to resolve the conflict. The negotiations, however, did not take place. The Soviets tried to contact Ma Hushan, the new commander of the Dungan 36th Division, via Ma Zhongying, to disarm Muhiti&#x27;s rebels. However, Muhiti, with 17 of his associated fled to British India on 2 April 1937.

After Muhiti&#x27;s flight to British India, Muhiti&#x27;s troops revolted. The revolt was Islamic in its nature. Muhiti&#x27;s officer Abdul Niyaz succeeded him and was proclaimed a general. Niyaz took Yarkand and moved towards Kashgar, eventually capturing it. Those with pro-Soviet inclinations were executed and thus new Muslim administration was established. Simultaneously, the uprising spread amongst the Kirghiz near Kucha and among Muslims in Hami. After capturing Kashgar, Niyaz&#x27;s forces started to move towards Karashar, receiving assistance from the local population along the way.

In order to jointly fight against the Soviets and Chinese, Niyaz and Ma Hushan signed a secret agreement on 15 May. Ma Hushan used the opportunity and moved from Khotan to take over Kashgar from the rebels in June, as promulgated by the agreement. However, 5,000 Soviet troops, including airborne and armoured vehicles were marching towards southern Xinjiang on Sheng&#x27;s invitation along with Sheng&#x27;s forces and Dungan troops.

The Turkic rebels were defeated and Kashgar retook. After the defeat of the Turkic rebels, the Soviets also stopped maintaining the 36th Division. Ma Hushan&#x27;s administration collapsed. By October 1937, along with the collapse of the Turkic rebellion and the Tungan satrapy, Muslim control over the southern part of the province ended. Soon afterwards, Yulbars Khan troops in Hami were also defeated. Thus, Sheng became the ruler of the whole province for the first time.

=== 1937‚Äì38 purges ===

During the Islamic rebellion, Sheng launched his own purge in Xinjiang to coincide with Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge. Sheng started the elimination of &quot;traitors&quot;, &quot;pan-Turkists&quot;, &quot;enemies of the people&quot;, &quot;nationalists&quot; and &quot;imperialist spies&quot;. His purges swept the entire Uyghur and Hui political elite. The NKVD provided the support during the purges. In the later stages of the purge, Sheng turned against the &quot;Trotskyites&quot;, mostly a group of Han Chinese sent to him by Moscow. In the group were Soviet General Consul Garegin Apresov, General Ma Hushan, Ma Shaowu, Mahmud Sijan, the official leader of the Xinjiang province Huang Han-chang, and Hoja-Niyaz. Xinjiang came under virtual Soviet control. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 people perished during the purge.

In 1937, Sheng initiated a three-year plan for reconstruction, for which he received a Soviet loan of 15¬†million rubles. At Joseph Stalin&#x27;s request, Sheng joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in August 1938 and received Party Card No.1859118 directly from Molotov during his secret visit to Moscow. However, Sheng did not set up the provincial branch of the CPSU in Xinjiang.

Having eliminated many of his opponents, Sheng&#x27;s administration had a staff shortage. For this reason, he turned to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Ya&#x27;an for help. In the circumstances of the Second United Front against the Japanese, the CCP sent dozens of its cadres to Xinjiang. The CCP members were mostly employed in high-level administrative, financial, educational and cultural ministerial posts in √úr√ºmqi, Kashgar, Khotan and elsewhere, helping to implement Sheng&#x27;s policies. They also maintained the only open communication line between Ya&#x27;an and the Soviet Union. Among those sent by the CCP was Mao Zemin, a younger brother of Mao Zedong, who served as Deputy Finance Minister.

=== Nationality policy ===

During Sheng&#x27;s rule, the Han Chinese represented only a small minority in Xinjiang. F. Gilbert Chan claimed that they made up only 6% of the population at the time, while Sheng himself during his visit in Moscow in 1938, told Kliment Voroshilov that the Han made around 10% (roughly 400,000 people) of the population of Xinjiang. In his relationship with Xinjiang&#x27;s non-Han populace, Sheng adopted the Soviet nationality policy. The non-Han nationalities were for the first time included in the provincial government. The first principle of his Declaration of Ten Guiding Principles stated that &quot;all nationalities enjoy equal rights in politics, economy, and education&quot;. He also reorganized Xinjiang Daily, the only regional newspaper at the time, to be issued in Mandarin, Uyghur and Kazakh language. The educational programme encouraged the Han to learn Uyghur and the Uyghurs to learn Mandarin. Sheng&#x27;s nationality policy also entailed the establishment of the Turkic languages schools, the revival of madrassas (Islamic schools), the publication of the Turkic languages newspapers and the formation of the Uyghur Progress Union.

Sheng initiated the idea of 14 separate nationalities in Xinjiang, and these were Han Chinese, Uyghurs, Mongols, Kazakhs, Muslims or Dungan, Sibe, Solon, Manchu, Kyrgyz, White Russian, Taranchi, Tajiks, and Uzbeks. To foster this idea, he encouraged the establishment of cultural societies for each nationality. The description of Xinjiang as a home of 14 nationalities, both in Xinjiang, as well as in proper China, brought Sheng popularity. However, Sheng&#x27;s policy was criticized by the Pan-Turkic Jadidists and East Turkestan Independence activists Muhammad Amin Bughra and Masud Sabri, who rejected the Sheng&#x27;s imposition of the name &quot;Uyghur people&quot; upon the Turkic people of Xinjiang. They wanted instead the name &quot;Turkic nationality&quot; (&quot;Tujue zu&quot; in Chinese) to be applied to their people. Sabri also viewed the Hui people as Muslim Han Chinese and separate from his own people. Bughra accused Sheng of trying to sow disunion among the Turkic peoples. However, Sheng argued that such separation was necessary in order to guarantee the success of the future union.

Another agenda from the Soviet Union Sheng implemented in Xinjiang was secularization with the purpose of undermining religious influence. Moreover, many Uyghurs and non-Han people were sent for education abroad, most notably in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR to the Central Asia University or Central Asia Military Academy. With their return, these students would find employment as teachers or within the Xinjiang administration.

Sheng&#x27;s nationality policy served as a basis for the later Communist regime&#x27;s nationality policy in Xinjiang, with few exceptions.

=== Relations with the Soviet Union ===

In March 1935, Lazar Kaganovich, who headed a newly established commission for developing areas of cooperation with Xinjiang, submitted a proposal to Politburo. Based on these proposals Politburo adopted a number of resolutions. Xinjiang received loans at low-interest rates, various economic assistance, and the sending of numerous consultants and specialists, which strengthened the position of Sheng&#x27;s regime.

Kaganovich proposed a trade turnover with Xinjiang in 1935 of 9750 thousand rubles, of which 5000 thousand rubles were to come to the share of import, and 4,750 thousand rubles from export operations. Since Kaganovich&#x27;s proposal was deemed unrealistic, Politburo once again discussed the issue and adopted the resolution &quot;On Trade with Xinjiang&quot; in June. According to the resolution, imports from Xinjiang were reduced, while exports remained the same. The imports from Xinjiang included cotton, wool, leather, livestock, and other raw materials.

The second section of the proposal deals with financial issues. To improve the financial sector of the Xinjiang economy and strengthen the provincial currency, it was proposed to balance the budget as a priority task. To this end, it was envisaged to reduce costs in administrative and managerial and military areas, centralise expenses and tax operations, replace all taxes with general provincial taxes, ban the issuance of counterfeit money, reconstruct a provincial bank, etc.

The proposal&#x27;s third section were concerned with agriculture and the fourth with transport issues. In that matter, the construction of the main road connecting Xinjiang and the Soviet Union, the increase of cargo transportation along the Ili and Kara Irtysh Rivers and a number of other measures were planned here. These works were later expanded. In October 1937, begun the construction of the Sary-Tash‚ÄìSary-Ozek‚Äì√úr√ºmqi‚ÄìLanzhou road with a length of 2,925¬†km, of which 230¬†km passed through the territory of the Soviet Union, 1,530¬†km through Xinjiang, and 1,165¬†km through the province of Gansu. Several thousands of Soviet citizens worked on the construction of the road.

The fifth section of the proposals prepared by the Kaganovich Commission regulated the issues of commodity credit. According to this section, machines and equipment supplied by the Soviets for the industrial enterprises being built and reconstructed in Xinjiang were to be registered as commodity loans.

The document related to the exploration work in Xinjiang stated that &quot;geological exploration of minerals and, first of all, tin, in Xinjiang, was done at the expense of the USSR&quot; and that the People&#x27;s Commissar of Heavy Industry (NKTP) was to send a geological expedition. The search for tin, tungsten, and molybdenum was very important for the Soviets, so they established a special expedition for this task.

The sixth section of the proposal dealt with personnel issues. The section suggests that the departments sending advisers and instructors to Xinjiang pay special attention to the qualitative selection of workers sent to Xinjiang. According to the Kaganovich Commission, the number of advisers and instructors sent to Xinjiang, including military consultants and instructors, should not exceed 50 people.

On 11 September 1935, Politburo adopted five resolutions regarding Xinjiang. In the second resolution, it decided to amend the Kaganovich proposal for the establishment of the joint-stock company and to replace it with a special Soviet trading office. Additionally, Politburo discussed the issue of &quot;Xinjiang Oil&quot; and adopted a resolution. The resolution called for the preparation of the development of oil near the Soviet border under the firm of the Xinjiang government. Exploration was carried out in accordance with this decision and in 1938 oil fields were discovered in Shikho. The same year, the joint Xinjiang-Soviet company &quot;Xinjiangneft&quot; was established. Also, General Consul Apresov was given extended powers. Soviet officials in Xinjiang needed his permission to take any action and he could dismiss any Soviet worker &quot;who did not know how to behave in a foreign country&quot;. Two days later he was awarded the Order of Lenin &quot;for successful work in Xinjiang&quot;.

Along with decisions concerning the economy, Politburo also adopted a resolution on the possibility for Xinjiang young people to receive education in the USSR. At first, there was a quota for 15 students, which was expanded to 100 in June 1936. In the 1930s, 30,000 Xinjiang people, preferably Chinese, received education in the various specialties in the Soviet Union.

The resolutions also concerned the reconstruction of the Xinjiang army. The Soviet Union sent equipment and instructors for this end. Xinjiang received aircraft, equipment for aviation, rifle-machine-guns and artillery workshops, uniforms, personal supplies, and other military equipment. Soviets also opened pilot schools to train local airmen. The Soviets also proposed the reduction of army to 10,000 men, but Sheng refused this proposal and instead reduced it to 20,000 men.

In an agreement from 16 May 1935, ratified without consent from the Chinese government, the Soviet government provided substantial financial and material aid, including a five-year loan of five million &quot;gold rubles&quot; (Sheng actually received silver bullion). At about the same time, again without consent from the Chinese government, Soviet geologists started a survey of Xinjiang&#x27;s mineral resources. The result was Soviet oil drilling at Dushanzi. During Sheng&#x27;s rule, Xinjiang&#x27;s trade came under Soviet control. The Soviet General Consul in √úr√ºmqi was effectively in control of governing, with Sheng required to consult them for any decision he made. Alexander Barmine, the Soviet official responsible for supplying arms to Sheng, wrote that Xinjiang was &quot;a Soviet colony in all but name&quot;.

The Soviet stranglehold around Xinjiang was further enhanced through a secret agreement signed on 1 January 1936. The agreement included a Soviet guarantee to come to the aid of Xinjiang &quot;politically, economically and by armed force... in case of some external attack upon the province&quot;. By mid-1936, a significant number of Soviet specialists were active in Xinjiang involved in construction, education, health, and military training. The Russian language replaced English as the foreign language taught in schools. A number of Muslim youths, including Muslim girls, were sent to Soviet Central Asia for education. Sheng&#x27;s government implemented atheistic propaganda, and Muslim women were encouraged to appear in public without a veil.

== Approachment to the Chinese government ==

Between 1934 and 1942, there were no significant relations between the Sheng&#x27;s government and the Nationalist government. As the full-scale War of Resistance/WWII broke out between China and the Empire of Japan, the Chinese government entered the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in a joint war effort against imperial Japan. However, with the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Sheng saw an opportunity to strike down Soviet proxies, the CCP and to mend his relationship with the Chinese government now seated in Chongqing.

Sheng had long prepared to purge the CCP in Xinjiang. In 1939, his agents filled reports on clandestine meetings, the constant exchange of letters, and the unauthorized content of some of their propaganda. A month after the German invasion, in July 1941, the CCP cadre had been demoted or cashiered. Chen Tanqiu, the chief liaison of the CCP reported in Yan&#x27;an that his relations with Sheng became &quot;extremely cold&quot;.

In the same month, the first sign of a thaw in the relationship between Xinjiang and the Chinese government occurred, a month after the German invasion, when Sheng allowed the Chinese diplomat in Moscow to visit Xinjiang for an official tour.

On 19 March 1942, Sheng&#x27;s brother Sheng Shiqi was mysteriously murdered. According to one version, the Soviets, fearing that Sheng Shicai might switch sides, tried to overthrow him. The coup started with Sheng Shiqi&#x27;s murder committed by his wife, convinced to do so by the Soviet agents. The other version is that he was murdered by Sheng Shicai because of his close ties to Moscow. After his brother&#x27;s death, Sheng continued his crackdown on the CCP. On 1 July 1942 he ordered their relocation in the √úr√ºmqi outskirts for &quot;protection&quot;.

On 3 July 1942, a major delegation of the Chinese government&#x27;s officials arrived at √úr√ºmqi upon Sheng&#x27;s invitation. Chiang Kai-Shek designated Zhu Shaoliang as a leader of the mission. The mission was initiated by Sheng&#x27;s younger brother Sheng Shiji a few months earlier. The reaction of the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov followed soon after, as he presented Chiang the Sheng&#x27;s ideas about the implementation of Communism in Xinjiang, his support for Chiang&#x27;s arrest in Xi&#x27;an Incident and the offer to make Xinjiang a Soviet republic. However, the Chinese government disregarded Molotov&#x27;s presentation. On 9 July, Chiang informed the Soviet ambassador that the Soviet authorities &quot;must now deal with the central government of China&quot; and are not permitted to &quot;discuss anything with Sheng &quot;duban&quot; [i. e. military governor]&quot;. Chiang designated Zhu Shaoliang as a contact person for the Soviets.

The later publication of Sheng&#x27;s correspondence with the Soviet authorities, allowed the Chinese government to set up a special office in √úr√ºmqi, from where they handled Xinjiang&#x27;s foreign affairs, and to set up the Kuomintang roots throughout the province, replacing the People&#x27;s Anti-Imperialist Association, which he disbanded in April 1942. Sheng was appointed the head of the provincial Kuomintang. Both dubanship and civil governorship remained in Sheng&#x27;s hands. The National Revolutionary Army troops were not allowed to enter Xinjiang.

As Wu Shaoliang shuttled between √úr√ºmqi and Chongqing, Sheng requested a permanent liaison to be appointed to handle his foreign affairs. The Chinese government appointed Wu Zexiang Minister of Foreign Affairs of Xinjiang. Ministerial position for a domestic post was unusual but approved by Chiang due to &quot;special conditions and circumstances&quot; in Xinjiang. Minister Wu&#x27;s post was of consultative nature, and the Chinese government acted as an arbiter in the case of a dispute between him and the provincial authorities. Sheng demanded that Wu assumes more responsibility in dealings with the Soviets.

The final months of 1942 saw the most turbulent period in Xinjiang-Soviet relations. In October 1942 Sheng demanded from the Soviet General Consul that all Soviet technical and military personnel be withdrawn from Xinjiang within three months. To the Soviets, who were engaged in the Battle of Stalingrad and desperate to retain the oil reserves at Dushanzi, which oil quality was comparable with product of Baku oil fields, this demand represented numerous logistical difficulties. On 3 November 1942 Sheng issued a directive prohibiting &quot;organizations, groups, and private persons&quot; to engage in &quot;any trade activity involving foreign imports and exports.&quot; The aim of the directive was to end the Soviet trade monopoly in Xinjiang. The Soviets withdrew their military and civilian personnel in March 1943. Despite Sheng&#x27;s ultimatum, only in March‚ÄìApril 1943 did the Soviets notify Sheng and the Chinese government of their withdrawal.

With the Soviet gradual withdrawal, the Kuomintang representatives and personnel filled the void. In June 1943, four divisions of the NRA New 2nd Army commanded by Zhu Shaoliang were transferred to Xinjiang from Gansu. In October 1943, the Kuomintang effectively removed Soviet influence from Xinjiang. With the Soviets gone, in September Sheng ordered the arrest and execution of the CCP cadres. Among them was Mao Zemin, Mao Zedong&#x27;s younger brother, who was among eighty-eight conspirators involved in the Soviet plot to overthrow Sheng.

== Later tenures and retirement ==

As the Germans lost the Battle for Stalingrad and Battle of Kursk, Sheng tried to return to the pro-Soviet policy. He ordered the arrest of the Kuomintang personnel, telling Stalin that they were Japanese spies, and telling Chiang that they were communists. Stalin, however, refused to intervene and left Sheng at the mercy of the Chinese government, which engineered his removal from office. Zhu Shaoliang convinced him to resign and accept the post of Minister of Agriculture. Sheng officially resigned from his post and was appointed as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry on 29 August 1944. He left Xinjiang on 11 September 1944 to join the Chinese government in Chongqing. The post of Minister of Agriculture under Kuomintang was reserved for men out of power since the post was insignificant with the increasing power of the landlords. Chiang signed an order allowing Sheng to recoup the wealth beneath the governor&#x27;s building. The storehouse contained fifty thousand taels of gold, chests full of valuable antelope horns, and endless blocks of opium. In total, Sheng removed 135 truckloads of wealth.

Sheng&#x27;s stay in Chongqing was troublesome. In April 1945, his former Finance Minister Peng Jiyuan was beaten in √úr√ºmqi, and sought refuge with Sheng after his recovery. Wu Zhongxin, his successor in Xinjiang, wrote that Sheng &quot;started to lose his mind in Chongqing&quot; and that in accordance with the tenets of Buddhism and as recompense for his past crimes, he has descended to the lowest depths of hell&quot;. At the Sixth Party Congress held in May 1945, Uyghur leader Masud Sabri called for Sheng&#x27;s head, however, Chiang defended Sheng. Sheng held the ministerial post until 30 July 1945, and later worked as an adviser to Hu Zongnan in Xi&#x27;an.

In 1949, Sheng accompanied the Kuomintang in Taiwan where he lived in comfortable retirement with his wife and four children. Sheng was interviewed by Allen S. Whiting and wrote his own accounts under the title &quot;Red failure in Sinkiang&quot; in &quot;Sinkiang: pawn or pivot?&quot;, published in 1958.

<text>Edward George Rodgers (20 July 1933 ‚Äì 2 May 2001) was an English comedian and light entertainment host who started his career as a Redcoat entertainer. He was best known for hosting the Yorkshire Television game show &quot;3-2-1&quot; from 1978 to 1988.

==Early life and career==
Rogers was born in Kennington, South London, the son of Edward Rodgers, a soap machine operator, and Lily May Rodgers n√©e Cobb, an office cleaner. He went to school in Lambeth. His idol as a youngster was Danny Kaye, and Rogers won a holiday camp talent contest impersonating Kaye as a youngster, but he would later put all showbusiness offers on hold whilst he did his national service in the Royal Air Force.

In the early 1960s, Rogers appeared as a stand up comedian on the radio programme &quot;Billy Cotton Band Show&quot;, alongside singers such as Tom Jones, Cliff Richard and Alma Cogan and comedians Terry Scott and Hugh Lloyd. He went on to host &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; in 1974. Rogers also appeared on the comedy panel game &quot;Jokers Wild&quot;. He was asked by Perry Como to join him on his tour of Britain in 1975 as a comedian after a Royal Variety Performance.

Bing Crosby later invited Rogers to join him on his concerts of 1976 and 1977, to form a double act and sing &quot;Gone Fishin&#x27;&quot; with Crosby as a tribute to Louis Armstrong. TV programme: Whilst on tour in 1977, Rogers was asked to film a pilot for a new television game show for Yorkshire Television.

==Gameshow host==
===&quot;3-2-1&quot;===
Rogers became the presenter of ITV&#x27;s variety gameshow 3-2-1 in 1978. It ran for just over ten years in a top-rating Saturday night slot. He earned ¬£130,000 a year in the early 1980s from 3-2-1 alone and combined this with a career as a highly paid after-dinner speaker, also making regular cabaret and public appearances.

In March 1986, he was featured on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Rogers was surprised by host Eamonn Andrews in Covent Garden, central London, with guests on the show including Jimmy Edwards and Sacha Distel.

3-2-1 was cancelled in December 1987, when it was still attracting audiences of 12 million and in the Top 20 ratings. Initially, the plan was for the show to carry on with Christmas and one-off specials. There was an Olympics special shown in September 1988, and a Christmas special that year, which was the final ever episode. In April 1996, Rogers told the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; that &quot;The Oxbridge lot got control of TV and they didn&#x27;t really want [the show]. It was too downmarket for them. We were still getting 12 million viewers when they took it off after 10 years. These days if a show gets nine million everyone does a lap of honour&quot;.

===After &quot;3-2-1&quot;===
In 1989, Rogers appeared on the ITV game show &quot;You Bet!&quot; In the early 1990s, Rogers fell on hard times and was declared bankrupt in February 1992, having apparently invested his fortune in a failed business venture, Wyvern Rogers Television. His home at Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, was repossessed, and Rogers&#x27; production company collapsed with debts of ¬£50,000. He moved from Buckinghamshire to a more modest home in Haslemere, Surrey.

Rogers was a guest on &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot; in January 1993, and in April 1994 he appeared on &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot;.

In 1997‚Äì98, Rogers appeared in the touring production of &quot;Danny and Me&quot;, a play about his hero, Danny Kaye, which often sold out. Towards the end of the decade, Challenge TV began repeating episodes of 3-2-1. In 2000, Rogers was seen during the sponsor credits for the ITV quiz &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; ‚Äì sitting in a dressing room with 3-2-1 mascot Dusty Bin and bemoaning the new show&#x27;s success.

In 1999 and 2000, Rogers made several commercials for fast food chain McDonald&#x27;s. On 10 November 2000, Rogers appeared as a guest on &quot;TFI Friday&quot;. His final television appearance, which was screened at the end of January 2001, saw him playing the host of a downmarket quiz show in the Series 13 episode &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Quizzical&quot; of the BBC children&#x27;s sitcom &quot;ChuckleVision&quot;. Had he lived, he would have worked with his old friend Jackie Mason on a Vaudeville-type act in America which was due to start in October 2001.

==Personal life and death==
Rogers was married twice. He married his childhood sweetheart Marge, in 1953, with whom he had two daughters. In 1979, he married Marion, with whom he had a daughter and a son.

On 2 May 2001, Rogers died after emergency open-heart surgery to repair a heart valve at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London, aged 67. He is buried at St Michael and All Angels Church, Sunninghill, in Berkshire.

<text>Use of san in archaic [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]] script: incised shard with a list of names, c.700 BC. The text reads:

&lt;/poem&gt;
Note the use of san at the end of most names, and the difference between san and mu (with a shorter right stem, ) in the word &quot;ŒëŒúŒ•ŒùŒ§Œëœ∫&quot;.
San () is an archaic letter of the Greek alphabet. Its shape is similar to Latin and Greek mu (), and can be described as a sigma () turned sideways. It was used as an alternative to sigma to denote the sound . Unlike sigma, whose position in the alphabet is between rho and tau, san appeared between pi and koppa in alphabetic order. In addition to denoting the archaic character, the name &quot;san&quot; also came to be used for sigma itself.

==Historical use==
=== Sigma and san ===

The existence of the two competing letters sigma and san is traditionally believed to have been due to confusion during the adoption of the Greek alphabet from the Phoenician script, because Phoenician had more sibilant sounds than Greek had. According to one theory, the distribution of the sibilant letters in Greek is due to pair-wise confusion between the sounds and alphabet positions of the four Phoenician sibilant signs: Greek sigma got its shape and alphabetic position from Phoenician shin (), but its name and sound value from Phoenician samekh. Conversely, Greek xi () got its shape and position from samekh (), but its name and sound value from shin.

According to a different theory, &quot;san&quot; was indeed the original name of what is now known as sigma, and as such presents a direct representation of the corresponding name &quot;shin&quot; in that position. This name was only later also associated with the alternative local letter now known as &quot;san&quot;, whose original name remains unknown. The modern name &quot;sigma&quot;, in turn, was a transparent Greek innovation that simply meant &quot;hissing&quot;, based on a nominalization of a verb (, from an earlier stem , meaning &#x27;to hiss&#x27;).

Moreover, a modern re-interpretation of the sound values of the sibilants in Proto-Semitic, and thus in Phoenician, can account for the values of the Greek sibilants with less recourse to &quot;confusion&quot;. Most significant is the reconstruction of shin as and thus also the source of the sound value of sigma; in turn, Samekh is reconstructed as the affricate , which is a better match for the plosive-fricative cluster value of xi.

Whereas in early abecedaria, sigma and san are typically listed as two separate letters in their separate alphabetic positions, each Greek dialect tended to use either san or sigma exclusively in practical writing. The use of san became a characteristic of the Doric dialects of Corinth and neighboring Sikyon, as well as Crete. San became largely obsolete by the second half of the fifth century BC, when it was generally replaced by sigma, although in Crete it continued in use for about a century longer. In Sikyon, it was retained as a symbolic mark of the city used on coin inscriptions, in the same way that archaic koppa () was used by Corinth, and a special form of beta by Byzantium). 

San could be written with the outer stems either straight () or slanted outwards (), and either longer or of equal length with the inner strokes (). It was typically distinguished from the similar-looking mu () by the fact that san tended to be symmetrical, whereas mu had a longer left stem in its archaic forms (, , ).

Outside Greece, san was borrowed into the Old Italic alphabets (, transcribed as ≈ö). It initially retained its M-shape in the archaic Etruscan alphabet, but from the 6th century BC changing its aspect to a shape similar to that of the d-rune .

The name &quot;san&quot; lived on as an dialectal or archaic name for sigma, even after the letter itself had been fully replaced by it. As such, Herodotus, in the late 5th century, reports that the same letter was called &quot;san&quot; by the Dorians, but &quot;sigma&quot; by the Ionians. Athenaeus in his &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; (c.200 AD) quotes an epigram which contained the spelled-out name of the philosopher Thrasymachus, still using san as the name for sigma:

===Arcadian &quot;tsan&quot;===

A unique letter variant, shaped (similar to modern Cyrillic , but with a slight leftward bend) has been found in a single inscription in the Arcado-Cypriot dialect of Mantineia, Arcadia, a 5th-century BC inscription dedicated to Athena Alea (&quot;Inscriptiones Graecae&quot; V.ii.262) It is widely assumed to be a local innovation based on san, although Jeffery (1961) classes it as a variant of sigma. It appears to have denoted a sound and has been labelled &quot;tsan&quot; by some modern writers. In the local Arcadian dialect, this sound occurred in words that reflect Proto-Greek . In such words, other Greek dialects usually have , while the related Cypriot dialect has . Examples are: 

* (cf. , &#x27;somebody&#x27;)
* (cf. , &#x27;somebody&#x27;)
* (cf. &#x27;to whomever&#x27;)
* (cf. &#x27;either&#x27;)

From these correspondences, it can be concluded that the letter most likely denoted an affricate sound, possibly or , which would have been a natural intermediate step in the sound change from to . The letter has been represented in modern scholarly transcriptions of the Mantinea inscription by ‚ü®≈õ‚ü© (s with an acute accent) or by ‚ü®œÉÃ±‚ü© (sigma with a macron underneath). 

Note, however, that the same symbol is used to denote the unrelated letter waw () in Pamphylia (the &quot;Pamphylian digamma&quot;) and was also the form of beta () used in Melos.

===Sampi ===
The Ionic letter sampi (), which later gave rise to the numeral symbol ( = 900) may also be a continuation of san, although it did not have the same alphabetic position.

===Bactrian ===
In the Greek script used for writing the Bactrian language, there existed the letter , which apparently stood for the sound (transliterated as ), and has been named &quot;sho&quot; in recent times. According to one hypothesis, this letter too may go back to san.

==Modern use==
In modern editions and transcriptions of ancient Greek writing, san has rarely been used as a separate letter. Since it never contrasts systematically with sigma except in abecedaria, it is usually silently regularized to sigma in modern editorial practice. In the electronic encoding standard Unicode, a pair of uppercase and lowercase forms of the letter was introduced in version 4.0 (2003). For this purpose, new lowercase forms for modern typography, for which no prior typographic tradition existed, had to be designed. Most fonts have adopted the convention of distinguishing uppercase san from mu by having its central V-like section descend only halfway down above the baseline, and lowercase san by giving it a left stem descending below the baseline. (Note that in historical epigraphic practice it was the other way round, with san being symmetrical and mu having a longer left stem.)

==Character encoding==

San is encoded in Unicode, while the Arcadian &quot;tsan&quot; variant is unified with the identical-looking Pamphylian Digamma since version 5.1.

<text>In mathematics, a Dirichlet formula_1-series is a function of the form

:formula_2

where formula_3 is a Dirichlet character and formula_4 a complex variable with real part greater than formula_5. It is a special case of a Dirichlet series. By analytic continuation, it can be extended to a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane, and is then called a Dirichlet formula_6-function and also denoted formula_7.

These functions are named after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet who introduced them in to prove the theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions that also bears his name. In the course of the proof, Dirichlet shows that formula_7 is non-zero at formula_9. Moreover, if formula_3 is principal, then the corresponding Dirichlet formula_6-function has a simple pole at formula_9. Otherwise, the formula_6-function is entire.

==Euler product==
Since a Dirichlet character formula_3 is completely multiplicative, its formula_6-function can also be written as an Euler product in the half-plane of absolute convergence:
:formula_16
where the product is over all prime numbers.

==Primitive characters==

Results about &quot;L&quot;-functions are often stated more simply if the character is assumed to be primitive, although the results typically can be extended to imprimitive characters with minor complications. This is because of the relationship between a imprimitive character formula_17 and the primitive character formula_18 which induces it:
:formula_19
(Here, &quot;q&quot; is the modulus of &quot;œá&quot;.) An application of the Euler product gives a simple relationship between the corresponding &quot;L&quot;-functions:
:formula_20
(This formula holds for all &quot;s&quot;, by analytic continuation, even though the Euler product is only valid when Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 1.) The formula shows that the &quot;L&quot;-function of &quot;œá&quot; is equal to the &quot;L&quot;-function of the primitive character which induces &quot;œá&quot;, multiplied by only a finite number of factors.

As a special case, the &quot;L&quot;-function of the principal character formula_21 modulo &quot;q&quot; can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function:
:formula_22

==Functional equation==

Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions satisfy a functional equation, which provides a way to analytically continue them throughout the complex plane. The functional equation relates the value of formula_23 to the value of formula_24. Let &quot;œá&quot; be a primitive character modulo &quot;q&quot;, where &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1. One way to express the functional equation is:
:formula_25
In this equation, Œì denotes the gamma function; 
:formula_26 ; and
:formula_27
where &quot;œÑ&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&amp;hairsp;&quot;œá&quot;) is a Gauss sum:
:formula_28
It is a property of Gauss sums that |&quot;œÑ&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&amp;hairsp;&quot;œá&quot;)&amp;hairsp;| = &quot;q&quot;1/2, so |&quot;W&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&amp;hairsp;&quot;œá&quot;)&amp;hairsp;| = 1.

Another way to state the functional equation is in terms of
:formula_29
The functional equation can be expressed as:
:formula_30

The functional equation implies that formula_23 (and formula_32) are entire functions of &quot;s&quot;. (Again, this assumes that &quot;œá&quot; is primitive character modulo &quot;q&quot; with &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1. If &quot;q&quot; = 1, then formula_33 has a pole at &quot;s&quot; = 1.)

For generalizations, see: Functional equation (L-function).

==Zeros==
Let &quot;œá&quot; be a primitive character modulo &quot;q&quot;, with &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1.

There are no zeros of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;s&quot;, &quot;œá&quot;) with Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 1. For Re(&quot;s&quot;) &lt; 0, there are zeros at certain negative integers &quot;s&quot;:
* If &quot;œá&quot;(‚àí1) = 1, the only zeros of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;s&quot;, &quot;œá&quot;) with Re(&quot;s&quot;) &lt; 0 are simple zeros at ‚àí2, ‚àí4, ‚àí6, ... (There is also a zero at &quot;s&quot; = 0.) These correspond to the poles of formula_34.
* If &quot;œá&quot;(‚àí1) = ‚àí1, then the only zeros of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;s&quot;, &quot;œá&quot;) with Re(&quot;s&quot;) &lt; 0 are simple zeros at ‚àí1, ‚àí3, ‚àí5, ... These correspond to the poles of formula_35.
These are called the trivial zeros.

The remaining zeros lie in the critical strip 0 ‚â§ Re(&quot;s&quot;) ‚â§ 1, and are called the non-trivial zeros. The non-trivial zeros are symmetrical about the critical line Re(&quot;s&quot;) = 1/2. That is, if formula_36 then formula_37 too, because of the functional equation. If &quot;œá&quot; is a real character, then the non-trivial zeros are also symmetrical about the real axis, but not if &quot;œá&quot; is a complex character. The generalized Riemann hypothesis is the conjecture that all the non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line Re(&quot;s&quot;) = 1/2.

Up to the possible existence of a Siegel zero, zero-free regions including and beyond the line Re(&quot;s&quot;) = 1 similar to that of the Riemann zeta function are known to exist for all Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions: for example, for &quot;œá&quot; a non-real character of modulus &quot;q&quot;, we have

:formula_38

for Œ≤ + iŒ≥ a non-real zero.

== Relation to the Hurwitz zeta function ==
The Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions may be written as a linear combination of the Hurwitz zeta function at rational values. Fixing an integer &quot;k&quot; ‚â• 1, the Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions for characters modulo &quot;k&quot; are linear combinations, with constant coefficients, of the &quot;Œ∂&quot;(&quot;s&quot;,&quot;a&quot;) where &quot;a&quot; = &quot;r&quot;/&quot;k&quot; and &quot;r&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot;. This means that the Hurwitz zeta function for rational &quot;a&quot; has analytic properties that are closely related to the Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions. Specifically, let &quot;œá&quot; be a character modulo &quot;k&quot;. Then we can write its Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-function as:

:formula_39

<text>The is a commuter rail line in the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto Metropolitan Area, owned and operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). The 61.3¬†km (38.1¬†mi) line runs between Osaka and Wakayama, Japan and has a 1.7¬†km branchline in a southern Osaka suburb. The name is taken from the second syllable of &quot;Osaka&quot; and the first syllable of &quot;Wakayama&quot;.

==Services==
The terminus of the line in Osaka is Tenn≈çji Station in Tenn≈çji-ku where most of the commuter trains on the line originate and terminate. However, many intercity limited express and rapid trains extend to the Osaka Loop Line beyond Tenn≈çji.

The terminus in Wakayama is Wakayama Station. Some trains from Osaka terminate before Wakayama and some spur off to Kansai Airport Station on the Kansai Airport Line from Hineno Station. Tracks are connected to the Kisei Main Line and some trains continue on from there.

The , also called the or the , between ≈åtori Station and Higashi-Hagoromo Station, is officially a part of the Hanwa Line. On the 1.7¬†km branch, only local shuttle trains operate.

==History==
The line was opened as a double-track electrified line by the Hanwa Electric Railway in 1929. In 1940, the company was merged with Nankai Railway (predecessor of Nankai Electric Railway) and became the Yamanote Line of Nankai. The Yamanote Line was then nationalized in 1944 and renamed the Hanwa Line.

When Kansai International Airport opened in 1994, the Hanwa Line became one of the main railway links between the city and the airport (along with the Nankai Main Line).

Station numbering was introduced in March 2018 with the Hanwa line being assigned station numbers between JR-R20 and JR-R54.

<text>Roadrunner Records is a Dutch‚ÄìAmerican record label focused on heavy metal and hard rock music. Founded in the Netherlands in 1980, it is now a division of Warner Music Group and is based in New York City. Formerly seen as one of the most powerful independent metal labels of the 1980s and 1990s, it would eventually become a massive host of metal acts; most seen in &quot;Roadrunner United&quot; and the following live concert. Since then, the label had continued to put out major releases. However, by the 2020s, most major acts had left the label; it was also acquired by Warner Brothers, being relegated to something much smaller than before.

==History==
The label was launched in 1980 in the Netherlands. Roadrunner&#x27;s initial business was importing North American metal-band recordings into Europe. In 1986, Roadrunner opened its US headquarters in New York City and later opened offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, Australia, Denmark, Russia and Canada. Early successes included albums from King Diamond (the first Roadrunner artist to enter the Billboard Top 200 albums chart) and Annihilator. The label also handled early Metallica releases in the Scandinavian region. The end of the 1980s saw the release of two albums that are now considered classics of their respective genres: Obituary&#x27;s &quot;Slowly We Rot&quot; and Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot;.

The 1990s saw the arrival of acts such as Cynic, Deicide, Life of Agony, Machine Head, Suffocation, Type O Negative, and underground grunge rockers Willard. As the 1990s wore on, several of Roadrunner&#x27;s bands managed to make an impact on the mainstream, most notably Sepultura and Type O Negative. Sepultura&#x27;s 1993 album, &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;, became the first Roadrunner band to crack the Top 40 on the Billboard album chart. Type O Negative became the first Roadrunner band to receive a certification from the RIAA; this was a Gold award (and later Platinum award) for the 1993 album &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;, which was certified in 1995. The band also became the first Roadrunner band to receive radio play. In 2000, Slipknot became the first Roadrunner band to go Platinum. Nickelback were also very successful on the label, although they were signed to another label in their native Canada. Derek Shulman ran the label in the late 1990s. In 2005, the label launched a new project called Roadrunner United to commemorate the label&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

Roadrunner Records ran into financial trouble in 2001 after its distribution deal with RED Distribution through Edel Music was aborted after Edel ended up in US$400¬†million in debt. As Roadrunner had just taken out a US$15¬†million loan from Edel, Cees Wessels was forced to put 49% of the label&#x27;s stock up for $30¬†million, attracting the interest of major labels such as RCA Records, Atlantic Records and Columbia Records. In July 2001, The Island Def Jam Music Group purchased a 50% stake in Roadrunner worth US$33¬†million, larger than the asking price. While there were fears of legal action from Edel, who owned 17% of Roadrunner&#x27;s stock, negotiations allowed the label to switch &quot;immediately&quot; to Island Def Jam and its distributor, Universal Music &amp; Video Distribution.

On December 18, 2006, Warner Music Group signed an agreement to purchase a majority in shares (73.5%) of Roadrunner Records&#x27; parent company, Roadrunner Music Group B.V. This deal became finalized on January 29, 2007, after receiving regulatory approval in Germany.

On June 11, 2008, Roadrunner Records was voted as the &quot;Best Metal Label&quot; by Metal Hammer at their Golden Gods Awards, an award that it has won the past four years in a row. The award was accepted by Sharon den Adel and Ruud Jolie of Within Temptation, one of Roadrunner&#x27;s biggest acts.

Roadrunner Records was significantly affected by Warner Music Group&#x27;s legal dispute against YouTube, including having their account&#x27;s YouTube partnership canceled. Most of the videos on their channel, however, are still viewable.

On November 11, 2010, Warner Music Group announced they had acquired the remaining of Roadrunner&#x27;s stock, acquiring the company fully. However, WMG maintained that Roadrunner would still continue to operate as a distinct brand. Cees Wessels, the label&#x27;s founder, remained as CEO. Employees at Roadrunner nicknamed WMG&#x27;s acquisition of the company &quot;The Red Wedding&quot;, in reference to the Game of Thrones episode &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot;.

On April 26, 2012, it was announced that Warner Music Group would make substantial cutbacks throughout Roadrunner Records worldwide operations. According to staff working at the company, the UK offices and the Canadian offices of Roadrunner Records are to be closed completely, with severe levels of cutbacks occurring across the rest of the label worldwide. It has also been announced that the Roadrunner office in the Netherlands is to close, and that the label&#x27;s founder Cees Wessels is stepping down from his role of CEO. The following years saw several major Roadrunner acts being dropped by the label, including DevilDriver, Cavalera Conspiracy and Alter Bridge (who both moved to Napalm Records, with Devildriver&#x27;s catalogue being sold to The Echo Label), Opeth, Machine Head, Slipknot (after releasing The End, So Far in 2022) and Soulfly (all of whom followed former A&amp;R of SVP Monte Conner to Nuclear Blast) and Dream Theater (who signed with InsideOut Music in 2017). In July 2017, British rock band Milk Teeth signed with Roadrunner Records.

In June 2018, Roadrunner became a sub-label of Warner&#x27;s Elektra Music Group division. In June 2022, Elektra Music Group, and subsequently Roadrunner, was merged into the new umbrella label group 300 Elektra Entertainment.

== Criticism ==
Since the 1990s, Roadrunner Records has been criticised by several of its past alumni over its record contracts, business practices and management and promotion of its releases. Artists who have criticised Roadrunner include Megadeth, Slipknot, Obituary, Opeth, Chimaira, Vision of Disorder and Sepultura.

Glassjaw members Daryl Palumbo and Justin Beck continue to speak unfavourably of Roadrunner, years after the problems the band experienced with them. They openly advise people not to buy their first full-length so as not to give the label money, and have repeatedly told fans at shows to illegally download the record. Palumbo has said: &quot;Roadrunner is a joke. Roadrunner&#x27;s not even a real label. It has the power to be one of the superpowers in the heavy music industry. While labels like Victory Records, which is such a small hardcore label, is totally surpassing Roadrunner... It&#x27;s like the scourge of the music industry. Beck has said: &quot;Seriously, don&#x27;t ever support anything from Roadrunner ‚Äì they suck!&quot; Palumbo has said that Roadrunner didn&#x27;t put the band on enough tours: &quot;We never toured half as much as we wanted to, I just wish we got to tour more in support of [&quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot;]&quot;; and, &quot;They are a miserable fuckin&#x27; corporation that does not bend for their bands, does not give their bands anything and they&#x27;re just terrible businessmen...They had 2 cash cows, Slipknot and Nickelback, and every other project they had rode backseat to those bands, and then the second that the new Slipknot record came out and didn&#x27;t go quadruple Platinum in the first few hours it was released they fuckin&#x27; turned their backs on Slipknot. That label just wants instant gratification where it sells its units and that&#x27;s a joke. You can&#x27;t run a major corporation with that as your business strategy&quot;&quot;.&quot;

<text>Sir John Edwin Sandys ( &quot;Sands&quot;; 19 May 1844 ‚Äì 6 July 1922) was an English classical scholar.

==Life==
Born in Leicester, England on 19 May 1844, Sandys was the 4th son of Rev. Timothy Sandys (1803‚Äì1871) and Rebecca Swain (1800‚Äì1853). Living at first in India, Sandys returned to England at the age of eleven and was educated at the Church Missionary Society College, Islington, then at Repton School. In 1863, he won a scholarship to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

On 17 August 1880, John married Mary Grainger Hall (1855‚Äì1937), daughter of Rev. Henry Hall (1820‚Äì1897), vicar of St Paul&#x27;s Church in Cambridge. Mary was born in St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England, and she died in Vevey, Switzerland, where she was a resident of the Hotel du Lac at the time of her death. She made a bequest to the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge (founded in 1884), which was the basis of a fund known as the Museum of Classical Archaeology Endowment Fund. John and Mary had no children.

Sandys died on 6 July 1922 in Cambridge. He is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.

==Works==
Besides editing several Greek texts, Sandys published: &quot;An Easter Vacation in Greece&quot; (1886); a translation and enlargement (with H. Nettleship) of Oskar Seyffert&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, Mythology, Religion, Literature and Art&quot; (1891); and &quot;The Harvard Lectures on the Revival of Learning&quot; (1905). He is best known, however, for his &quot;A History of Classical Scholarship&quot; (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press) (3 vols.) (vol. 1, 1903; vols. 2 and 3, 1908). In 1910, Macmillan &amp; Co. published the Latin speeches and letters that he gave as a public orator at the University of Cambridge from 1876 to 1909. He was also supervising editor of &quot;A Companion to Latin Studies&quot; (1910; 2nd ed., 1913).

==Recognition==

Sandys obtained a Bell Scholarship and won several prizes for Greek and Latin prose. In 1867, he was elected Fellow at his college and was appointed to a lectureship, then later a tutorship. He was elected public orator in 1876 and was given the title &quot;orator emeritus&quot; when he retired in 1919. He was awarded honorary doctorates from the universities of Dublin (1892), Edinburgh (1909), Athens (1912) and Oxford (1920). He was made a Fellow of the British Academy (1909) and a Commander in the Greek Order of the Saviour. He was knighted in 1911.

On September 16, 1910, was founded and renamed a month after. Osaka Electric Tramway completed Ikoma Tunnel and started operating a line between Osaka and Nara (present-day Nara Line) on April 30, 1914. The modern Kashihara, Osaka, and Shigi lines were completed in the 1920s, followed by the Kyoto Line (a cooperative venture with Keihan Electric Railway). Daiki founded in 1927, which consolidated on September 15, 1936.

In 1938, Daiki teamed up with its subsidiary to operate the first private railway service from Osaka to Nagoya. Another subsidiary Sanky≈´ bought Kansai Express Electric Railway on January 1, 1940 and continued the service on its own. Then, Sanky≈´ consolidated on August 1. Daiki consolidated its largest subsidiary &quot;Sanky≈´&quot; on March 15, 1941 and was renamed . &quot;Kanky≈´&quot; consolidated on February 1, 1943 and moved its headquarters from Uehommachi to Osaka Abenobashi.

Kanky≈´ was renamed after it consolidated Nankai Railway in June 1944: it maintained the name when Nankai regained its independence in 1947.

After World War II, Kintetsu branched out and became one of the world&#x27;s largest travel agencies, Kinki Nippon Tourist Co., Ltd., opening offices in the United States of America (Kintetsu International Express, Inc.) and other countries.

The first charged limited express train service started between Uehommachi and Nagoya in 1947, and this is the start of the present Kintetsu limited express trains. The rail network was mostly completed by consolidating , , and other companies.

Kintetsu moved its headquarters again from Osaka Abenobashi to Osaka Uehommachi on December 5, 1969.

On June 28, 2003, Kinki Nippon Railway Co., Ltd. was renamed Kintetsu Corporation. The corporation was split on April 1, 2015. Its railway business division was succeeded by Kintetsu Split Preparatory Company, Ltd. (founded on April 30, 2014), while its real estate business division by Kintetsu Real Estate Co., Ltd., its hotel business division by Kintetsu Hotel Systems, Inc., and its retail business by Kintetsu Retail Service Corporation, respectively.

On the same day Kintetsu Corporation was split, it was renamed as Kintetsu Group Holdings Co., Ltd. as a holding company, while Kintetsu Split Preparatory Company, Ltd. was renamed as Kintetsu Railway Co., Ltd.

<text>Kildare () is a town in County Kildare, Ireland. , its population was 10,302, making it the 7th largest town in County Kildare. It is home to Kildare Cathedral, historically the site of an important abbey said to have been founded by Saint Brigid of Kildare in the 5th century. The Curragh lies east of the town.

The town lies on the R445, some west of Dublin ‚Äì near enough for it to have become, despite being a regional centre in its own right, a commuter town for the capital. Although Kildare gives its name to the county, Naas is the county town.

==History==

===Founding by Saint Brigid===
Rich in heritage and history, Kildare Town dates from the 5th century, when it was the site of the original &#x27;Church of the Oak&#x27; and monastery founded by Saint Brigid. This became one of the three most important Christian foundations in Celtic Ireland.

It was said that Brigid&#x27;s mother was a Christian and that Brigid was reared in her father&#x27;s family, that is with the children of his lawful wife. From her mother, Brigid learned dairying and the care of the cattle, and these were her occupations after she made a vow to live a life of holy chastity. Both Saint Mel of Ardagh and Bishop have been credited with the consecration of Brigid and some companions, after which the woman established a community beneath an oak tree, on a hill on the edge of the Curragh. Hence the name , the church of the oak.

Not too far away, on , lived the King of Leinster who had donated the site to the holy woman. A story told was that the King had offered Brigid as much land as her cloak would cover. When she spread her garment it miraculously stretched out to embrace the entire Curragh. True to his promise, the King gave her the fertile plain, and there the new community grazed their sheep and cows.

===Carmelite Friary (White Abbey) Church, Kildare===

The Carmelite Friars accepted the invitation of Lord William de Vesci and came to Kildare in 1290. This same de Vesci also established the Franciscans in the Grey Abbey and built the original castle of Kildare. With the suppression of the monasteries under Henry VIII, White Abbey was surrendered on 3 April 1539. The Friars, however, continued to minister clandestinely to the people of the area during the next two centuries. When the Penal Laws were relaxed in the 1750s, the Carmelites returned to Kildare and erected a church and a school close to or on the original 1290 foundation. This eighteenth century church served the Carmelites and the people in the district for more than one hundred years. The foundation stone of the present church was laid on 8 December 1884. The architect was William Hague who designed churches in the Pugin style. The church is therefore gothic in design and the builder was John Harris of Monasterevan, who used Wicklow granite and local stone from Boston, Rathangan. The church is cruciform in plan with the nave being set off with alternating window and arched roof-truss. The transepts are defined by polished granite pillars with moulded bases and carved caps which support arches in line with the walls of the nave. The side chapels are seen from the transepts and chancel through arches springing from moulded piers which also support the large chancel arch with its polished granite corbel shafts, moulded bases and carved caps. The principal entrance doorway faces east with pillared jambs, carved tympanum and moulded arches set in a projecting porch. The tower, with its lantern belfry, extends above the level of the nave roof. It has deeply recessed windows on each face and is finished with a moulded cornice. From this point, the tapering spire rises to a height of 40 metres and is surmounted by a cross. On the north transept wall of the church are inserted ‚Äì for safekeeping ‚Äì some interesting fifteenth/sixteenth century stone sculptures which came from the ruins of the Franciscan Grey Abbey. They are similar to the carvings from Great Connell and Dunfierth, also in County Kildare, and probably came from the same workshop. The stained glass in the church includes scenes from the lives of Our Lord and the Blessed Virgin Mary, from the Scapular Vision, as well as Saints Patrick and Brigid, and the four Evangelists. The rose window over the main entrance is of special interest with its centrepiece being the Prophet Elijah, the spiritual founder of the Order. The surrounding panels show St Telesphorus, St Dionysius, St Albert (Patriarch of Jerusalem), St Andrew Corsini, St Cyril of Alexandria, St Louis IX, St Angelus, and St Albert of Sicily.

In February 2016, the Carmelite Church and Friary were entrusted to the Indian Carmelites.

===Milestone in early motorsport===
In July 1903, the Gordon Bennett Cup ran through Kildare. It was the first international motor race to be held in Britain or Ireland. The Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland wanted the race to be hosted in Britain or Ireland, and Ireland was suggested as racing was illegal on British public roads. The editor of the &quot;Dublin Motor News&quot; suggested an area in County Kildare, and letters were sent to politicians, newspapers, railway companies, hoteliers, and clergy to win support and amend local laws. Kildare was chosen, among other candidate venues, partly because the straightness of the roads was deemed a safety benefit. As a compliment to Ireland, the British team chose to race in Shamrock green which became known as British racing green. The 528¬†km race ran on a loop through parts of counties Kildare and Carlow, including Kildare town. It was won by Belgian racer Camille Jenatzy in a Mercedes.
