<doc id="409628" wikidata="Q952233" url="?curid=409628" title="David Wojnarowicz">
<text>David Michael Wojnarowicz ( ; September 14, 1954 – July 22, 1992) was an American painter, photographer, writer, filmmaker, performance artist, songwriter/recording artist, and AIDS activist prominent in the East Village art scene. He incorporated personal narratives influenced by his struggle with AIDS as well as his political activism in his art until his death from the disease in 1992.

==Biography==
Wojnarowicz was born in Red Bank, New Jersey, where he and his two siblings and sometimes their mother were physically abused by their father, Ed Wojnarowicz. Ed, a Polish-American merchant marine from Detroit, had met and married Dolores McGuinness in Sydney, Australia, in 1948 when he was 26 and she was 16. After his parents&#x27; bitter divorce, Wojnarowicz and his siblings were kidnapped by their father and raised in Michigan and Long Island. After finding their young, Australian-born mother in a New York City phone book, they moved in with her. During his teenage years in Manhattan, Wojnarowicz worked as a street hustler around Times Square. He graduated from the High School of Music &amp; Art in Manhattan. By 1971, at age 17, Wojnarowicz was living on the streets full time, sleeping in halfway houses and squats.

After a period outside New York, Wojnarowicz returned in the late 1970s and emerged as one of the most prominent and prolific members of an avant-garde wing that used mixed media as well as graffiti and street art. His first recognition came from stencils of houses afire that appeared on the exposed sides of East Village buildings.

Wojnarowicz completed a 1977–1979 photographic series on Arthur Rimbaud, did stencil work and collaborated with the band 3 Teens Kill 4, which released the independent EP &quot;No Motive&quot; in 1982. He made autonomous super-8 films such as &quot;Heroin&quot; and &quot;Beautiful People&quot; with bandmate Jesse Hultberg, and collaborated with filmmakers Richard Kern and Tommy Turner of the Cinema of Transgression. He exhibited his work in well-known East Village galleries and New York City landmarks, notably Civilian Warfare Gallery, Ground Zero Gallery NY, Public Illumination Picture Gallery, Gracie Mansion Gallery, and Hal Bromm Gallery.

Wojnarowicz was also connected to other prolific artists of the time, appearing in or collaborating on works with Nan Goldin, Peter Hujar, Luis Frangella, Karen Finley, Kiki Smith, James Romberger, Marguerite Van Cook, Ben Neill, Marion Scemama, and Phil Zwickler. 

In early 1981, Wojnarowicz met the photographer Peter Hujar, and after a brief period as lovers, came to see Hujar as his great friend and mentor. Weeks after Hujar died of AIDS on November 26, 1987, Wojnarowicz moved into his loft at 189 2nd Avenue. He was soon diagnosed with AIDS himself and, after successfully fighting the landlord to keep the lease, lived the last five years of his life in Hujar&#x27;s loft. Inheriting Hujar’s dark room—and supplies like rare Portriga Rapid paper—was a boon to Wojnarowicz&#x27;s artistic process. It was in this loft that he printed elements of his ‘Sex Series’ and an edition of “Untitled (Buffalos)”. 

Hujar&#x27;s death moved Wojnarowicz to create much more explicit activism and political content, notably about the social and legal injustices related to the government response to the AIDS epidemic. He collaborated with video artist Tom Rubnitz on the short film &quot;Listen to This&quot; (1992), a critique of the Reagan and Bush administrations&#x27; homophobic responses and failure to address the crisis. The film was shown at MoMA&#x27;s 2017-18 exhibit &quot;Club 57: Film, Performance, and Art in the East Village, 1978–1983.&quot;

In 1985, Wojnarowicz was included in the Whitney Biennial&#x27;s so-called &quot;Graffiti Show.&quot; In the 1990s, he sued and obtained an injunction against Donald Wildmon and the American Family Association on the grounds that Wojnarowicz&#x27;s work had been copied and distorted in violation of the New York Artists&#x27; Authorship Rights Act.

Wojnarowicz&#x27;s works include &quot;Untitled (One Day This Kid...)&quot;, &quot;Untitled (Buffalo)&quot;, &quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Birth of Language II&quot;, &quot;Untitled (Shark)&quot;, &quot;Untitled (Peter Hujar)&quot;, &quot;Tuna&quot;, &quot;Peter Hujar Dreaming/Yukio Mishima: St. Sebastian&quot;, &quot;Delta Towels&quot;, &quot;True Myth (Domino Sugar)&quot;, &quot;Something From Sleep II&quot;, &quot;Untitled (Face in Dirt)&quot;, and &quot;I Feel a Vague Nausea&quot;.

Wojnarowicz also wrote two memoirs in his lifetime including &quot;Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration&quot;, discussing topics such as his troubled childhood, becoming a renowned artist in New York City, and his AIDS diagnosis and &quot;Memories that Smell like Gasoline.&quot; &quot;Knives&quot; opens with an essay about his homeless years: a boy in glasses selling his skinny body to the pedophiles and creeps who hung around Times Square. The heart of &quot;Knives&quot; is the title essay, which deals with the sickness and death of Hujar, Wojnarowicz&#x27;s lover, best friend and mentor, &quot;my brother, my father, my emotional link to the world&quot;. In the final essay, &quot;The Suicide of a Guy Who Once Built an Elaborate Shrine Over a Mouse Hole&quot;, Wojnarowicz investigates the suicide of a friend, mixing his own reflections with interviews with members of their shared circle. In 1989, Wojnarowicz appeared in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s widely acclaimed film &quot;Silence = Death&quot; about gay artists in New York City fighting for the rights of AIDS sufferers.

Wojnarowicz died at home in Manhattan on July 22, 1992, at the age of 37, from what his boyfriend Tom Rauffenbart confirmed was AIDS. 

After his death, photographer and artist Zoe Leonard, a friend of Wojnarowicz, exhibited a work inspired by him, &quot;Strange Fruit (for David)&quot;.

===&quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot; controversy===
In November 2010, after consultation with National Portrait Gallery director Martin Sullivan and co-curator David C. Ward but not co-curator Jonathan David Katz, Smithsonian Institution Secretary G. Wayne Clough removed an edited version of footage used in Wojnarowicz&#x27;s short silent film &quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot; from the exhibit &quot;Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture&quot; at the National Portrait Gallery in response to complaints from the Catholic League, U.S. House Minority Leader John Boehner, Representative Eric Cantor and the possibility of reduced federal funding for the Smithsonian. The video contains a scene with a crucifix covered in ants. William Donohue of the Catholic League claimed the work was &quot;hate speech&quot; against Catholics. Gay historian Jonathan Ned Katz wrote:

====Response from Clough and Smithsonian====
Clough later said that although he stood by his decision, it &quot;might have been made too quickly&quot;, and called the decision &quot;painful.&quot; He said that because of the controversy surrounding the footage and the possibility that it might &quot;spiral out of control&quot;, the Smithsonian might have been forced to shut down the entire &quot;Hide/Seek&quot; exhibition, and that was &quot;something he didn&#x27;t want to happen.&quot;

The video work was shown intact when Hide/Seek moved to the Tacoma Art Museum.

====Response from the art world and the public====
In response, the curator David C. Ward defended the artwork, saying, &quot;It is not anti-religion or sacrilegious. It is a powerful use of imagery&quot;. The Andy Warhol Foundation announced that it would not fund future Smithsonian projects, while several institutions, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Tate Modern, scheduled showings of the removed work.

The decision led to multiple protests.

On December 9, National Portrait Gallery Commissioner James T. Bartlett resigned in protest. Clough issued a statement standing by the decision. Several Smithsonian curators criticized the decision, as did critics, with &quot;Newsweek&quot; arts critic Blake Gopnik going so far as to call the complaints &quot;gay bashing&quot; and not a legitimate public controversy.

===Notable posthumous exhibitions===
In 2011, P.P.O.W. Gallery showed &quot;Spirituality&quot;, an exhibition of Wojnarowicz&#x27;s drawings, photographs, videos, collages, and personal notebooks; in a review in &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot;, Kara L. Rooney called the show &quot;meticulously researched and commendably curated from a wide array of sources, ... a mini-retrospective, providing context and clues for Wojnarowicz&#x27;s often elusive, sometimes dangerous, and always brutally honest work.&quot;

In 2018, the Whitney Museum of American Art hosted a major retrospective, &quot;David Wojnarowicz: History Keeps Me Awake at Night&quot;, which was co-curated by the Whitney&#x27;s David Kiehl and art historian David Breslin. It received international praise.

==Influence==
In 1992, the band U2 used Wojnarowicz&#x27;s tumbling buffalo photograph &quot;Untitled (Buffaloes)&quot; for the cover art of its single &quot;One&quot;. The band further adapted this imagery during its Zoo TV Tour. The single and subsequent album became multi-platinum over the next few years, and the band donated a large portion of its earnings to AIDS charities. An oversized gelatin print of &quot;Untitled (Buffaloes)&quot; sold at auction in October 2014 for $125,000, more than four times the estimated price.

In 1988, Wojnarowicz wore a leather jacket with the pink triangle and the text: &quot;If I die of aids - forget burial - just drop my body on the steps of the F.D.A.&quot;. In his 1991 memoir &quot;Close to the Knives&quot;, Wojnarowicz imagined &quot;what it would be like if, each time a lover, friend or stranger died of this disease, their friends, lovers or neighbors would take the dead body and drive with it in a car a hundred miles an hour to Washington, D.C., and blast through the gates of the White House and come to a screeching halt before the entrance and dump their lifeless form on the front steps.&quot; On October 11, 1992, activist David Robinson received wide media attention when he dumped the ashes of his partner, Warren Krause, on the grounds of the White House as a protest against President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s inaction in fighting AIDS. Robinson reported that his action was inspired by this text in &quot;Close to the Knives&quot;. In 1996, Wojnarowicz&#x27;s own ashes were scattered on the White House lawn.

His name appears in the lyrics of the Le Tigre song &quot;Hot Topic.&quot; &quot;Weight of the Earth&quot;, the transcription of Wojnarowicz&#x27;s audio journals, inspired Mega Bog&#x27;s album &quot;Life, and Another&quot;, and gives its name to the song &quot;Weight of the Earth, on Paper&quot;.

On September 13, 2021, at the Met Gala in New York City the Canadian actor Dan Levy wore an outfit by designer Jonathan Anderson for Loewe which prominently featured an adapted version of Wojnarowicz&#x27;s artwork &quot;F--- You F----- F-----&quot; depicting 
two men kissing while shaped as maps, with the support of the visual artist&#x27;s estate.

==Events==
* January 1: The CBC News Service officially begins operations in English; operations in French begin the following day. CBC&#x27;s board of governors determined that a national news service would assist in reporting the war.
* March 4: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police begin to register Japanese Canadians; registration is completed by the end of August.
* April 29: Quebec, the last province to exclude women from the legal profession, allow women to practise law. The first Quebec woman lawyer is Elizabeth Monk, who is called to the bar the next year.
* July 24: Workers began an illegal strike at the Alcan aluminum complex at Arvida, Quebec, when 700 workers walk off the job. Some 4,500 workers occupy the factory the next day. Minister of Munitions and Supply C.D. Howe says that enemy sabotage was responsible for the work stoppage, and soldiers are sent to secure the facility. Work resumes on July 29 as workers and management negotiate, assisted by federal conciliators. A subsequent royal commission rejects the sabotage theory and finds that the strike was the result of worker dissatisfaction with wages and working conditions, as well as a heat wave that occurred immediately before the strike. 
* August 9–12: The Atlantic Conference meeting between Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins, as well as their civilian and military advisers, is held secretly aboard the USS &quot;Augusta&quot; docked in Ship Harbour, Placentia Bay, Argentia in the Dominion of Newfoundland. The leaders discuss Lend-Lease and the war in Europe. The conference was the first of nine wartime meetings between FDR and Churchill. On August 14, the leaders publicly issue the Atlantic Charter, a joint declaration of Anglo-American aims, including freedom of the seas, self-determination, free government, and liberal trade.
* August 12: All Japanese Canadians are ordered to carry identity cards with their thumbprint and photo.
* August 13: An order-in-council (PC 6289) establishes the Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Corps. The Women&#x27;s Royal Canadian Naval Service is established the following year.
* September 19: torpedoes and sinks , killing 18 sailors.
* December 7: collides with a merchant ship and sinks in the North Atlantic, killing 23 sailors.
* December 7 (North America time)/December 8 (Hong Kong time): Battle of Hong Kong: On the same morning as the attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attack British Hong Kong, with relentless air raids for the next days. Hong Kong surrenders on December 25. Some 1,975 Canadian soldiers are posted in the colony, mostly infantry with the Royal Rifles of Canada and Winnipeg Grenadiers, who had arrived to reinforce the colony on October 27 aboard the &quot;Awatea&quot;, escorted by . The Japanese attack is a disaster for the Canadians, who were greatly outnumbered by the Japanese. Of the 1,975 Canadians who went to Hong Kong, more than 1,050 were killed or wounded, and many are taken prisoner by Japan.
* December 8: Immediately following the Japanese attack on Hong Kong, Canada declares war on Japan, on the same day that Britain and the United States do so. 
* December 8: The day after Japanese attacks on Hong King and Pearl Harbor, all fishing boats owned by Japanese Canadians are impounded by the Royal Canadian Navy.
* December 9: John Hart becomes Premier of British Columbia, replacing Thomas &quot;Duff&quot; Pattullo, after a Liberal convention dumps Pattullo as leader and replaces him with Hart. Following the October 21 provincial election in which the Liberals fell to 21 seats while the CCF won 14 and the Conservatives 12, Pattullo&#x27;s government had faltered. Hart forms a coalition between the Liberals and the Conservatives.

<text>Clive Michael Charles (3 October 1951 – 26 August 2003) was an English football player, coach and television announcer. He was one of five National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) coaches to win more than 400 games.

Charles was born in Bow and raised in Canning Town. Charles&#x27;s father was a seaman from Grenada and his mother a white woman from Silvertown. Charles began his career with West Ham United, where his brother John Charles played. In 1978, he began playing professionally in the United States with the NASL Portland Timbers. He spent the last years of his playing career in the Major Indoor Soccer League, first with the Pittsburgh Spirits, then with the Los Angeles Lazers.

Charles spent his later life in the United States, coaching at the high school, collegiate and international levels in the Portland, Oregon area, primarily at Reynolds High School and the University of Portland. In 2002, he coached the University of Portland&#x27;s women&#x27;s soccer team to the national championship. He also coached the US Men&#x27;s National Team to the semifinals of the 2000 Summer Olympics, the farthest the US men had gone since 1904. In 2001, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which he died in 2003.

His father was a merchant seaman originally from Grenada and his mother a white woman from Silvertown. He grew up in a working-class neighbourhood playing street football.

==Career==
===Playing career===
When he was 12 years old, Charles began playing with the West Ham United youth teams and signed with the club as an apprentice when he turned 15. He would sign with West Ham as a full professional when he turned 17 and joined the first team in 1970 as a defender. However, West Ham was stocked with talent and Charles had difficulty finding playing time. In 1971 and 1972, he played two seasons on loan from West Ham with the Montreal Olympique of the now defunct North American Soccer League (NASL). While with Montreal, he met his future wife Clarena, then a flight attendant flying between Montreal and England. He was also honoured as a second team NASL All Star in both of his seasons in Montreal. When playing time continued to elude Charles, West Ham loaned him to Second Division side Cardiff City for the last 8 games of the 1974 season. Even though Cardiff City were relegated to the Third Division, Charles chose to sign with the team and became its captain at the age of 23. Cardiff won promotion back to the Second Division in 1976. Charles finished his career with Cardiff City in 1978, playing over 100 games and scoring 5 goals.

In 1978, the NASL Portland Timbers bought Charles&#x27; contract from Cardiff City. He remained with the Timbers through the 1981 outdoor season. However, injuries began to hamper Charles and in 1981, he played only 4 games with the Timbers and did not return to the team the next year. In addition to playing for the Timbers&#x27; outdoor team, Charles had played 9 games for the Timbers during the 1980–1981 NASL indoor season. His jersey, number 3, was retired by the Timbers after his death in 2003. He was honoured by the Timbers during a game against the Seattle Sounders FC on 24 June 2012 by a large tifo held up by the Timbers Army prior to the start of the game.

At the end of the 1981 NASL season, Charles moved to the indoor Pittsburgh Spirit and then the Los Angeles Lazers, both of the Major Indoor Soccer League. He later admitted that &quot;I hated it. But it paid the bills.&quot; In 1982, he was playing with the when Jimmy Conway, a former Timbers teammate, called Charles and told him of an opening at the Reynolds High School boys&#x27; soccer team in Troutdale, Oregon. He immediately retired from playing and moved his family back to Oregon.

===Coaching career===
Charles began his coaching as a young player in England, but he had no idea then the success coaching would bring to him. Charles remained with Reynolds High School for three years before the University of Portland hired Charles as its men&#x27;s soccer coach in 1986. In 1989, the university expanded his duties to include both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. He would continue coaching the UP teams until his death. In his last season (2002), the UP women&#x27;s team won the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship. During his tenure as the men&#x27;s coach, Charles had a hand in beginning the career of numerous outstanding future players, including American men&#x27;s internationals Kasey Keller, Steve Cherundolo, and Conor Casey, American women&#x27;s internationals Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon MacMillan, and Canadian international Christine Sinclair. Other players include Yari Allnutt, Scott Benedetti, Kelly Gray, Nate Jaqua and Wade Webber.

In 1986, Charles founded F.C. Portland, a local youth soccer club. The club fields numerous youth teams in local, state and national competitions.

Charles also spent several years as coach of the US U23 men&#x27;s national team, culminating with the 2000 Summer Olympics. During this period, Charles was battling prostate cancer, but continued to coach the US and achieved a fourth-place finish in the games, their best finish at the Olympics in almost a century. He retired from coaching the U23 team after the Olympics with a record of 23–11–13 (.628). He also coached the team to a bronze medal at the 1999 Pan American Games and third place at the 1997 World University Games. He also served as an assistant coach of the United States men&#x27;s (senior) national soccer team in the 1998 World Cup.

In 1994, he worked as an announcer for ESPN during the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

==Death==
Charles was first diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000, and underwent weekly chemotherapy treatments to treat the disease. He ultimately died of the cancer on 26 August 2003 in Portland. He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame that same year. He is interred at Mount Calvary Cemetery in Portland.

A member of the Democratic Party, she was first elected to Congress in 2002 in . Sánchez serves on the Ways and Means Committee; she was the ranking member on the House Ethics Committee until 2017. In the 114th Congress, she chaired the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

She is the younger sister of former U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez; to date, they are the only pair of sisters to have served in Congress.

==Early life, education and career==
Sánchez was born on January 28, 1969, in Orange, California. She grew up with six siblings, raised by Mexican immigrant parents in Anaheim, where she attended Valencia High School. She earned her BA in Spanish literature with an emphasis in bilingual education at the University of California, Berkeley, and her Juris Doctor degree in 1995 at the UCLA School of Law, where she was an editor of the &quot;Chicano-Latino Law Review&quot;.

Before her public service career, Sánchez was an attorney specializing in labor law. In 1998, she joined the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 441 and became a compliance officer. From 2000 to 2002, she was executive secretary and treasurer of the Orange County branch of the AFL-CIO.

==Political campaigns==
===39th congressional district (2003–2013)===
Sánchez started her political career in what was then the 39th district. That district had previously been the 38th, represented by five-term Republican Steve Horn. It already had a modest Democratic lean, but redistricting following the 2000 U.S. census made it even more Democratic, prompting Horn to retire.

Sánchez finished first in a six-person primary for the Democratic nomination in March 2002. She won the primaries with 33.5% of the vote; the second-place candidate, Hector de la Torre, received 29.3%. She went on to win the general election against Republican Tim Escobar, 54.9% to 40.8%. This made Sánchez the first woman IBEW member to be elected to Congress.

She ran unopposed in the Democratic primaries in 2004. She faced Escobar again in the general election, defeating him 60.7% to 39.3%. In the 2006 election, she defeated two primary challengers with 77.8% of the vote and attorney James L. Andion in the general election.

Linda and her sister Loretta became the first pair of sisters to serve together in the U.S. House of Representatives. Loretta represented an Orange County district from 1997 until 2017, after she announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate. She finished second in California&#x27;s &quot;top two&quot; primary, before she was defeated by fellow Democrat, then-California Attorney Genera Kamala Harris in the 2016 general election.

===38th congressional district (2013–present)===

On October 4, 2011, Sánchez made a statement on LGBT History Month, saying: &quot;We must continue to strive to end discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation and fight so that all Americans have the right to marry and start families with those they love. I remain committed to supporting marriage equality, investments in HIV/AIDS care, treatment and research, and campaigns that take action against bullying in schools.&quot;

In a February 9, 2010, letter to President Barack Obama, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Charles Schumer, Sánchez wrote: &quot;Currently, U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents may sponsor their spouses (and other immediate family members) for immigration purposes. But same-sex partners committed to spending their lives together are not recognized as &#x27;families&#x27; under U.S. immigration law and thus do not have this same right. [...] This is unacceptable, and we believe comprehensive immigration reform legislation must include a strong family reunification component inclusive of LGBT families.&quot;

=== Drug policy ===

She has said that she believes health care is a basic right. She declined to vote for Representative John Conyers&#x27;s universal health care bill HR 676, citing the need to support the Affordable Care Act.

===Immigration===
After the Arizona state legislature passed State Senate Bill 1070 and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed it into law, Sánchez claimed that the law, and similar laws throughout the country, were the product of white supremacists: &quot;There&#x27;s a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state-by-state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups. It&#x27;s been documented. It&#x27;s not mainstream politics.&quot; Representative Gary Miller called Sánchez&#x27;s comments &quot;an outrageous accusation.&quot; Steve Poizner also condemned them.

===Technology===
Twice in 2009, Sánchez introduced the &quot;Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act,&quot; H.R. 1966, a bill that would criminalize the use of electronic communications if &quot;the intent is to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to a person.&quot; The bill is a response to the suicide of Megan Meier, a 13-year-old girl whose 2006 suicide was attributed to cyberbullying on the social networking site MySpace. The bill has drawn criticism from members of the online community, legal scholars, and others who contend that it would infringe on the constitutional right to freedom of speech.

=== Tax reform ===

===War===

==Personal life==

Sánchez married Jim Sullivan on April 13, 2009, in the district office of Congressman John B. Larson, who introduced the two about two years before the wedding. The marriage is Sánchez&#x27;s second, and Sullivan has three sons from a previous marriage. On May 13, 2009, she became the eighth woman to give birth while serving in Congress when she had her first son.

==Works==
* Linda Sánchez, Loretta Sánchez and Richard Buskin, &quot;Dream in Color: How the Sánchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress&quot;, Grand Central Publishing (September 2, 2008) , foreword by Nancy Pelosi

In 2008, Loretta and Linda Sánchez published the joint memoir &quot;Dream in Color: How the Sánchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewed the book and wrote: &quot;Linda and Loretta Sánchez present their compelling story—noteworthy not only for their history-making achievements (including first sisters or women of any relation to serve together in Congress, first woman and person of color to represent a district in Orange County, first Latina on the House Judiciary Committee and first Head Start child to be elected to Congress) but also for its &#x27;American Dream&#x27; aspect—their parents immigrated from Mexico and despite lacking a formal education managed to send their seven children to college. Interweaving childhood vignettes with accounts of serving in Congress, both from California, this refreshing book evades many of the tropes of the typical political memoir—perhaps because these two women are not typical politicians.&quot;

<text>Edward Randall Royce (born October 12, 1951) is an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from California from 1993 to 2019. A member of the Republican Party, Royce served as Chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs from 2013 to 2019. He previously served as a member of the California Senate from 1982 to 1993.

He was reelected to his seat in 2016, having spent over $3.5 million on his campaign. On January 8, 2018, Royce announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his term and not run for reelection in 2018.

In September 2020, Royce joined the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

==Early life and education==
Royce was born in Los Angeles, California. He graduated from Katella High School in Anaheim, California. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Accounting and Finance in 1977 from California State University, Fullerton.

==Early career==
Royce was a business owner and corporate tax manager for a Portland cement company before becoming a California State Senator in 1983, serving in that post until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
After redistricting following the 1990 United States census, incumbent Republican U.S. Representative William Dannemeyer decided to retire and run for the 1992 U.S. Senate election. Royce won the Republican primary for what was then California&#x27;s 39th congressional district, which included most of northern Orange County and southern Los Angeles County.

He defeated Democrat Molly McClanahan in the general election with 57% of the vote.

He won re-election to the 39th district four more times with at least 63% of the vote. After redistricting after the 2000 United States census, his district was renumbered the 40th and cut back to northern Orange County. He won re-election from this district five more times with at least 63% of the vote.

;2012

After redistricting, Royce&#x27;s home in Fullerton was drawn into the 39th district. That district had previously been the 42nd District, represented by fellow Republican Gary Miller. Although it was geographically more Miller&#x27;s district than Royce&#x27;s, Royce would have been favored in a primary battle with Miller–which would have been the real contest in this heavily Republican district. Ultimately, Miller opted to move to the neighboring 31st District, effectively handing the seat to Royce.

Royce defeated Jay Chen in the general election.

=== Tenure ===

In 2012 he was endorsed by 11 of 14 Republicans as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and has served as chairman since January 2013.

Royce voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

===Committee assignments===

* Committee on Financial Services
** Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government-Sponsored Enterprises
** Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
* Committee on Foreign Affairs, Chair

===Caucus memberships===
* Human Rights Caucus
* Congressional Military Family Caucus
* Congressional Internet Caucus
* House Recycling Caucus
* Victim&#x27;s Rights Caucus
* International Conservation Caucus
* Congressional Caucus on Korea
* Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans
* Congressional Caucus on Vietnam
* Taiwan Caucus
* U.S. Philippines Friendship Caucus

*Climate Solutions Caucus
* House Baltic Caucus
* Republican Study Committee
* Co-chair United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus

===Retirement===
Situated in a district that supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential election by a margin of eight points, Royce was widely viewed as one of the most vulnerable members of Congress. As of December 2017, polling in the 39th District showed a 36% approval rating for Royce and a 60% disapproval rating for President Trump. Additionally, the data showed that a large majority of voters disapproved of Royce&#x27;s public support and vote in favor of the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Acknowledging the difficult campaign ahead and the end of his six-year term as Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, Royce decided to announce his retirement and decision to not run for reelection in 2018 via Twitter on January 8, 2018. Thirty minutes following his announcement, President Trump formally nominated Royce&#x27;s wife Marie Royce to be Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs. In retiring, Royce joined the &quot;casualty list&quot; of 36 Republican members of the 115th Congress who have left or announced their intention to leave the House of Representatives.

==Political positions and PACs==

Royce voted in line with President Trump&#x27;s position in 97.9% of the votes in the 115th United States Congress. For the 114th United States Congress, Royce was ranked as the 27th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from California) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party). Over his career, Royce has received nearly $7 million from PACs. In the 2016 race, he raised over $4.2 million and spent over $3.5 million.

His campaign committee received funds from Northwest Excavating, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and NorPac. The Sunlight Foundation gave Royce&#x27;s web site a 24 percent rating for transparency, with 40 percent being considered a passing score. Royce&#x27;s website highlights support from conservative groups such as 60 Plus and business organizations such as the National Taxpayers Union and Citizens Against Government Waste. He received praise from the American Share Holders Association, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and the Small Business Survival Committee.

For the 113th Congress, the Washington Post named Royce as one of the “10 most effective lawmakers in the U.S. Congress”, citing his authorship of the Global Anti-Poaching Act (H.R. 2494) and the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 (H.R. 2297).

===Domestic policy===
Royce&#x27;s voting record, his scores on VoteMatch, and ratings by the Cato Institute indicate mixed or moderate positions on free trade, privatization of social security, campaign finance, and tax reform.

==== Abortion ====

Royce is pro-life.

====Banking deregulation, business issues====
One of Royce&#x27;s early signature issues was banking deregulation. He has sponsored legislation on tax policy, small businesses, and credit. Many of his biggest campaign contributors have been banks: his five top contributors in 2006 were Credit Union National Assn, Irvine Co., Wells Fargo, Orange County Teachers Fed Credit Union, and GUS plc. He is among the representatives receiving the largest percentage of their campaign contributions from the banking industry.

On November 13, 2013, Royce introduced the Credit Union Share Insurance Fund Parity Act (H.R. 3468; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would expand federal deposit insurance to include Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (IOLTAs) and similar escrow accounts housed within credit unions.

==== Cannabis ====

Royce has a &quot;C&quot; rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. He voted against allowing veterans access to medical marijuana, if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor&#x27;s recommendation.

==== Guns ====

Royce had a &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund regarding his voting record on gun-related matters.

In the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Royce posted on Facebook: &quot;We need to defeat the terrorists and make it our top national security priority to prevail in the war against radical Islamic extremism.&quot;

====Taxes and budgets====
He has received 14 &quot;Taxpayer Friend Awards&quot; from the National Taxpayers&#x27; Union. Royce opposes funding for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Royce has posited that these overseas investments expose taxpayers to a serious potential liability, just like the S&amp;L crisis did.

====Victims&#x27; rights====
Royce sponsored anti-stalking legislation signed into law by President Bill Clinton, which was based on legislation Royce had authored as a California State Senator. In 2003, he sponsored another bill as US representative related to victims.

====Health care====
On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act.

===Foreign policy===
In foreign policy, Royce&#x27;s voting record has earned a 0% rating from the peace organization SANE. In 2011, Royce voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.

==== Iran nuclear agreement ====
In 2016, Royce criticized the Iran nuclear agreement and Obama administration harshly, saying the deal was &quot;a financial windfall” for Iran and a &quot;a cash bonanza, a boost to its international standing, and a lighted path toward nuclear weapons.&quot; He called for re-introducing sanctions on Iran. Later, in 2017, after Donald Trump had become president, Royce said that he was in favor of staying in the Iran nuclear agreement.

====North Korea====

Royce serves as a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia. He and has been especially involved in policy regarding North Korea, working on issues such as human rights, counterfeiting of U.S. currency, nuclear proliferation, and stopping repatriation of refugees. Royce&#x27;s district includes Fullerton, which has a large population of Korean immigrants. During a slow-rolling crisis in 2017 between the US and North Korea, Royce introduced legislation expanding sanctions against North Korea and requiring that its designation as a state sponsor of terror be reinstated.

====Conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Yemen====
Royce was a supporter of the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2002, he voted in favor of authorizing President George W. Bush to use force in Iraq. In 2003, he voted yes on an emergency appropriation of $78 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 2003 to 2006, he voted in favor of the annual supplemental spending bill to continue funding for the Iraq war. In 2005, he voted against Amendment 214 to HR 1815, which called on Bush to develop a plan for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq; in favor of Amendment 488 to HR 2601 to keep troops in Iraq; and in favor of HR 612 opposing a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq. In 2006, he voted for HR 861, a resolution labeling the war in Iraq as part of a global war against terrorism.

He has supported U.S. broadcasting efforts in Asia, initiating legislation to create Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Afghanistan on the model of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Royce had a mixed voting record on the 2011 US involvement in Libya. In 2015, he supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

====Genocide in Myanmar====
In 2018, Royce condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis, saying that &quot;Defining these atrocities for what they are is critical to building international public awareness – and support – to stop them.&quot;

====Africa====
Royce was formerly chair of the Africa Subcommittee. He co-led, with Colin Powell, a delegation to observe Nigeria&#x27;s historic elections in 1999 and led a delegation to Darfur to bring attention to the ongoing genocide in 2005 and led efforts in the House to bring Charles Taylor, the former President of Liberia, to stand trial before the Special Court of Sierra Leone.

===Legislation===
On April 26, 2013, Royce introduced the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2013 (H.R. 1771; 113th Congress), a bill that would increase U.S. sanctions on North Korea. Royce said that &quot;by shutting down North Korea&#x27;s illicit activities, we deprive the Kim regime of the money he needs to pay his generals and to conduct nuclear weapons research.&quot; Royce also argued that &quot;North Korea is undoubtedly one of the most significant security threats that we here face and our allies face.&quot;

On June 27, 2013, Royce introduced the Electrify Africa Act of 2013 (H.R. 2548; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the President to establish a multiyear strategy to assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa develop an appropriate mix of power solutions to provide sufficient electricity access to people living in rural and urban areas in order to alleviate poverty and drive economic growth.

On November 13, 2013, Royce introduced the Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014 (H.R. 3470; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would allow the sale of several Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates to Mexico, Thailand, and Taiwan. Four naval vessels would be sold to Taiwan for about $10 million each. Mexico and Thailand would each receive two vessels as a grant. Royce argued in favor of the bill saying that &quot;these ships would bolster Taiwan&#x27;s defense.&quot; Royce also said that &quot;these transfers help support the priorities of the U.S. Navy while strengthening the capability of allies and our close partners to meet our share maritime security objectives.&quot;

In January 2017, Royce introduced a House resolution condemning the UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law.

<doc id="409650" wikidata="Q378133" url="?curid=409650" title="Hendrik Conscience">
<text>Henri(Hendrik)Conscience (3 December 1812 – 10 September 1883) was a Belgian author. He is considered the pioneer of Dutch-language literature in Flanders, writing at a time when Belgium was dominated by the French language among the upper classes, in literature and government. Conscience fought as a Belgian revolutionary in 1830 and was a notable writer in the Romanticist style popular in the early 19th century. He is best known for his romantic nationalist novel, &quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot; (1838), inspired by the victory of a Flemish peasant militia over French knights at the 1302 Battle of the Golden Spurs during the Franco-Flemish War.

Over the course of his career, he published over 100 novels and novellas and achieved considerable popularity. After his death, with the decline of romanticism, his works became less fashionable but are still considered as classics of Flemish literature.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Hendrik was the son of a Frenchman, Pierre Conscience, from Besançon, who had been (wheelhouse master) in the navy of Napoleon Bonaparte, and who was appointed under-harbourmaster at Antwerp in 1811, when that city formed part of France. Hendrik&#x27;s mother was a Fleming, Cornelia Balieu, and was illiterate. When, in 1815, the French abandoned Antwerp after the Congress of Vienna, Pierre Conscience stayed behind. He was an eccentric and he took up the business of buying and breaking-up worn-out vessels, which the port of Antwerp was full of after the peace.

The child grew up in an old shop stocked with marine stores, to which the father afterwards added a collection of unsellable books; among them were old romances which inflamed the fancy of the child. His mother died in 1820, and the boy and his younger brother had no companion other than their grim and somewhat sinister father. In 1826 Pierre Conscience married again, this time a widow much younger than himself, Anna Catherina Bogaerts.

Hendrik had long before this developed a passion for reading, and reveled all day long among the ancient, torn and dusty tomes which passed through the garret of The Green Corner on their way to being destroyed. Soon after his second marriage Pierre took a violent dislike of the town, sold the shop and retired to the Campine (Kempen) region which Hendrik Conscience so often describes in his books; the desolate flat land that stretches between Antwerp and Venlo. Here Pierre bought a little farm with a large garden. Here, while their father was buying ships in faraway harbours, the boys would spend weeks, sometimes months, with their stepmother.

===Adolescence and introduction to literature===

At the age of seventeen Hendrik left his father&#x27;s house to become a tutor in Antwerp and to continue his studies, which were soon interrupted by the Belgian Revolution of 1830. He volunteered in the Belgian revolutionary army, served at Turnhout and fought the Dutch near Oostmalle, Geel, Lubbeek and Louvain. After the Ten Days&#x27; Campaign of 1831 he stayed in army barracks at Dendermonde, becoming a non-commissioned officer, rising to the rank of sergeant-major. In 1837 he left the service and returned to civilian life. Having been thrown in with young men of all walks of life he became an observer of their habits. He considered writing in the Dutch language although at the time that language was believed to be unfit for literature as French was the language of the educated and the ruling class.

Although nearby, across the river Scheldt, the Netherlands had a thriving literature that was centuries old, written in a language hardly different from Dutch spoken in Belgium, the Belgian prejudice towards &quot;Flemish&quot; persisted. French was the language used by the politicians who founded Belgium in 1830. It was this language that had been chosen to be Belgium&#x27;s national language. It was spoken by the ruling class in Belgium. Nothing had been written in Dutch for years when Belgium&#x27;s independence became a fact in 1831, separating Belgium and her Flemish provinces from the Netherlands. The divide between the two languages was no more to be bridged. It was therefore almost with the foresight of a prophet that Conscience in 1830 wrote: &quot;I do not know why but I find in the Flemish language indescribably romantic, mysterious, profound, energetic, even savage. If I ever gain the power to write, I shall throw myself head over ears into Flemish composition.&quot;

==Work and career==
His poems, however, written while he was a soldier, were all in French. He received no pension when he was discharged, and returning to his father&#x27;s house without a job, he made a conscious decision to write in Dutch. A passage in Guicciardini fired his fancy, and straightaway he wrote a series of vignettes set during the Dutch Revolt, with the title &quot;In &#x27;t Wonderjaer&quot; (1837). The work was self-published and cost nearly a year&#x27;s salary to produce.

===&quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot;===

His father thought it so vulgar of his son to write a book in Dutch that he evicted him, and the celebrated novelist of the future started for Antwerp, with a fortune which was strictly confined to two francs and a bundle of clothes. An old schoolfriend found him in a street and took him home. Soon people of standing, amongst them the painter Gustaf Wappers, showed interest in the unfortunate young man. Wappers even gave him a suit of clothes and eventually presented him to King Leopold I, who ordered the &quot;Wonderjaer&quot; to be added to the libraries of every Belgian school. But it was with Leopold&#x27;s patronage that Conscience published his second book, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, in 1837. A small appointment in the provincial archives relieved him from the actual pressure of want, and, in 1838, he made his first great success with the historical novel &quot;De Leeuw van Vlaenderen&quot; (&quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot;), which still holds its place as one of his masterpieces, the influence of which extended far beyond the literary sphere. Despite the commercial success of the book, its high printing costs meant that Conscience did not receive much money from its sales.

During the 19th century, many nationalist-minded writers, poets and artists in various European countries were turning characters from their countries&#x27; respective histories and myths into romantic icons of national pride. With &quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot; Conscience did this successfully with the character of Robert of Bethune, the eldest son of Guy de Dampierre, count of Flanders, crusader and, most importantly from Conscience&#x27;s point of view, a prominent protagonist in a struggle to maintain the autonomy of Flanders against great odds.

Historians have accused Conscience of historical inaccuracies, such as depicting his hero to have taken part in the Battle of the Golden Spurs which, in fact, he did not. It was also pointed out that in reality &quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot; did not speak Dutch. Neither did his father, the count of Flanders Guy de Dampierre. Yet Robert of Bethune, &quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot;, is still presented as a symbol of Flemish pride and freedom, which is due to the romantic, albeit incorrect portrayal by Conscience. Conscience&#x27;s portrayal also inspired &quot;De Vlaamse Leeuw&quot; (&quot;The Flemish Lion&quot;), the long-time unofficial anthem of Flemish nationalists and only recently recognised officially as the anthem of Flanders.

===Subsequent work===

&quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot; was followed by &quot;How to become a Painter&quot; (1843), &quot;What a Mother can Suffer&quot; (1843), &quot;Siska van Roosemael&quot; (1844), &quot;Lambrecht Hensmans&quot; (1847), &quot;Jacob van Artevelde&quot; (1849), and &quot;The Conscript&quot; (1850). During these years he lived a varied existence, for some thirteen months being a gardener in a country house, but eventually as secretary to the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. It was long before the sale of his books—greatly praised but seldom bought—made him financially independent to some extent. His ideas however, began to be generally accepted. At a congress in Ghent in 1841, the writings of Conscience were mentioned as the seed which was most likely to yield a crop of national literature. Accordingly, the patriotic party undertook to encourage their circulation, and each new contribution by Conscience was welcomed as an honor to Belgium.

In 1845 Conscience was made a Knight of the Order of Leopold. Writing in Dutch had ceased to be seen as vulgar. On the contrary, the language of the common man became almost fashionable and Flemish literature began to thrive.

In 1845 Conscience published a History of Belgium at the request of King Leopold I. He then returned to picturing Flemish home-life which would form the most valuable portion of his work. He was by now at the zenith of his genius, and &quot;Blind Rosa&quot; (1850), &quot;Rikketikketak&quot; (1851), &quot;The Poor Gentleman&quot; (1851), and &quot;The Miser&quot; (1853) rank among the most important of the long list of his novels. These had an instant effect upon more recent fiction, and Conscience had many imitators.

===Contemporary reception===
In 1855, translations of his books began to appear in English, French, German, Czech and Italian which achieved considerable popularity outside Belgium. By 1942, it was estimated that one German translation of Conscience&#x27;s work &quot;The Poor Gentleman&quot; alone had sold over 400,000 copies since its translation. The French writer, Alexandre Dumas, plagiarized Conscience&#x27;s book, &quot;The Conscript&quot;, to produce a work of his own, profiting from the chaotic intellectual property laws of the time. Numerous pirated translations also appeared.

===Later life and death===
In 1867 the position of keeper of the Royal Belgian Museums was created and given to him at King Leopold&#x27;s demand. From then on, he lived in the custodian&#x27;s house of the Wiertz Museum, now adjacent to the European Parliament. He continued to produce novels with great regularity, his publications amounting to nearly eighty in number. He was by now the most eminent of Belgian writers. In Antwerp, his 70th birthday was celebrated with public festivities. After a long illness, he died at his house in Brussels in 1883. His funeral was held nearby, at St Boniface&#x27;s Church in Ixelles. He was buried at the Schoonselhof cemetery in Antwerp, his tomb a monument honoring the great writer.

==Critical reception==
Most of Conscience&#x27;s work can be considered as clearly within the Romanticist school of literature and they make extensive use of rhetorical soliloquies and sentiment. Subsequent developments in literary understanding, particularly the realism movement which emerged in Conscience&#x27;s lifetime, have meant that his work sometimes seems &quot;outmoded and primitive&quot; to modern readers. His use of language has also been criticized. According to Theo Hermans, Conscience &quot;was no linguistic virtuoso, his narratives are sentimental, his plots unreal and his moral judgments conservative to the point of being reactionary.&quot; Hermans did, however, praise Conscience&#x27;s ability to &quot;draw the reader into a fictional world&quot; and for his ability to evoke battles and natural scenes through description, as well as his use of changes in tempo to draw the reader&#x27;s attention.

<doc id="409652" wikidata="Q718768" url="?curid=409652" title="Queen dowager">
<text>A queen dowager or dowager queen (compare: princess dowager or dowager princess) is a title or status generally held by the widow of a king. In the case of the widow of an emperor, the title of empress dowager is used. Its full meaning is clear from the two words from which it is composed: queen indicates someone who served as queen consort (i.e. wife of a king), while dowager indicates a woman who continues to hold the title from her deceased husband (a queen who reigns in her own right is a queen regnant). A queen mother is a former queen consort, often a dowager queen, who is the mother of the reigning monarch.

 there are four queens dowager: Kesang Choden of Bhutan (who is the only living queen grandmother worldwide), Norodom Monineath of Cambodia (who is also queen mother), Lisa Najeeb Halaby (Noor Al&#x27;Hussein) of Jordan, and Sirikit Kitiyakara of Thailand (who is also queen mother).

== Status ==
A queen dowager has an important royal position (whether or not she is the mother of the reigning sovereign) but does not normally have any rights to succeed a king as monarch on his death unless she happens to be next in line to the throne (one possibility would be if the king and queen were also cousins and childless, the king had no other siblings, and she in her other position as his cousin was also his heiress presumptive).

A queen dowager continues to enjoy the title, style, and precedence of a queen, but is no longer referred to as &quot;the&quot; queen. A new reigning king would have (at accession or eventually) a wife who would be the new queen consort and therefore &quot;the&quot; queen; a queen regnant would also be called &quot;the&quot; queen. Many former queens consort do not formally use the word &quot;dowager&quot; as part of their titles. There may be more than one queen dowager at any given time. The Garter King of Arms&#x27;s proclamation in the United Kingdom of the styles and titles of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother at her funeral on 9 April 2002 illustrates her dual status as a queen dowager and a queen mother:

== Distinction from queen mother ==
A queen mother is a former queen, often a queen dowager, who is the mother of the current monarch. Not every queen mother is a queen dowager, such as Queen Paola of Belgium, who became the queen mother of her son Philippe after her husband Albert II abdicated the throne but retained the title of king. Not all queens dowager are the queen mother; they may have a relation other than mother to the reigning monarch, such as aunt or grandmother. For example, Mary, Queen of Scots, was queen dowager of France after the death of her husband Francis II, to whom she bore no children. Similarly, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen was queen dowager after her husband William IV was succeeded by his niece Victoria.

Not every mother of a reigning monarch is the queen mother or a queen dowager. For example, the mother of Queen Victoria of United Kingdom, Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, was neither a queen dowager nor the queen mother because her husband, Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, had never been king. Similarly, whilst being the mothers of monarchs, both Augusta of Saxe-Gotha and Srinagarindra of Thailand were not styled queen dowager because their respective husbands, Frederick, Prince of Wales and Mahidol Adulyadej, Prince of Songkla, were never kings. Instead, Augusta held the title of &quot;Dowager Princess of Wales&quot; (a precedent was Henry VII of England&#x27;s mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, titled &quot;My Lady the King&#x27;s Mother&quot;); Srinagarindra meanwhile received the designation &quot;Princess Mother&quot;.

As there is only one monarch, there can only be one queen mother. It is possible for there to be a queen mother and one or more queens dowager alive at any one time. This situation occurred in the Commonwealth realms in the period between the accession of Queen Elizabeth II on 6 February 1952 and the death of her paternal grandmother on 24 March 1953, when, for slightly over a year, there were three queens alive:

* Queen Elizabeth II, the reigning monarch (queen regnant).
* Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, the widow of the deceased King George VI and the mother of the reigning queen. Queen Elizabeth, the former queen consort, specifically adopted the appellation &quot;queen mother&quot; to distinguish herself from her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. She reportedly loathed being referred to as a &quot;dowager queen&quot;, and felt there would be confusion if she were called simply by her name, as her two immediate predecessors, Queen Mary and Queen Alexandra, had been.
* Queen Mary, the widow of King George V, the mother of the former king Edward VIII (the then Duke of Windsor) and of the late King George VI. Queen Mary had been the queen mother from the death of her husband in 1936 until the accession of her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II, in 1952. She continued to be titled and styled &quot;Her Majesty Queen Mary&quot;.

== British queens dowager ==

There were several former queens consort of England, Scotland, and later the United Kingdom, who were never queen mothers. The following queens were dowagers between the given dates, whether queen mothers or not:

Of England:
* Edith of Wessex 5 January 1066 – 18 December 1075, wife of Edward the Confessor; sister of Harold Godwinson.
* Adeliza of Louvain 1 December 1135 – 23 April 1151, wife of Henry I of England; remarried to William d&#x27;Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel in 1139.
* Eleanor of Aquitaine 6 July 1189 – 1 April 1204, wife of Henry II of England; &quot;queen mother&quot; to Richard I and John.
* Berengaria of Navarre 6 April 1199 – 23 December 1230, wife of Richard I of England.

<doc id="409653" wikidata="Q472199" url="?curid=409653" title="Jerry Lewis (California politician)">
<text>Charles Jeremy Lewis (October 21, 1934 – July 15, 2021) was an American politician who was a U.S. representative, last serving . He was first elected to Congress in 1978, and previously represented the 40th, 35th, and 37th districts. A Republican, he was chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, serving in that role during the 109th Congress. In January 2012 he announced that he was not running for re-election and would end his congressional career in January 2013.

==Personal life==
Lewis was born in Seattle, Washington. In 1952 he graduated from San Bernardino High School in San Bernardino, California, where he captained the swim team. In 1956 he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from UCLA. Lewis served as a Coro Foundation fellow in San Francisco. After college, Lewis was in the insurance business.

Lewis died on July 15, 2021, in Redlands, California, at the age of 86.

==Early political career==
He was a member of the San Bernardino City Unified School District from 1964 to 1968. He was on the staff of Congressman Jerry Pettis in 1966.

He was a member of the California State Assembly from 1969 to 1978. In January 1974, he ran in a special election for the California State Senate, losing to Democrat Ruben Ayala. In the campaign, Ayala noted that two-thirds of the $130,000 that Lewis raised came from 43 donors — 22 of whom were Sacramento lobbyists.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In November 1978, Lewis was elected as a Republican to the 96th United States Congress, in what was then the 37th Congressional district, with 61% of the vote. He was subsequently re-elected 16 times. He never won re-election with less than 61% of the vote. In fact, he only dipped below 65% four times (1990, 1992, 2006, and 2008).

In 2008, Lewis received his strongest challenge in decades from San Bernardino attorney Tim Prince, who won a 4-candidate Democratic primary. Lewis was forced to spend over a million dollars to retain his seat. He declined Prince&#x27;s challenges for a debate. The incumbent defeated him with 62% of the vote.

On January 12, 2012, Lewis announced his retirement.

===Tenure===
Lewis employed his wife, Arlene Willis, as the chief of staff in his office. Before they were married, Willis was her husband&#x27;s top aide when he came to Capitol Hill in 1979.

In 1994, he was named chairman of the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee, where he worked until 1999 to improve oversight to uncover fraud and abuse in large housing programs and reduce spending on wasteful programs within a number of federal agencies.

He steered federal dollars to the state and to the region for projects such as the planning and construction of the Seven Oaks Dam near Highland, California. Among his proudest achievements came early in his career as a state assemblyman, pushing for the establishment of the first air quality committee in the state Legislature, which led to the formation of the South Coast Air Quality Management District in the mid-1970s.

In 1998, he secured start-up funding for Loma Linda University&#x27;s Proton Beam treatment center, which has led to the installation of similar cancer treatment centers across the U.S.

Lewis placed special riders in a series of appropriations bills that freed up nearly $100 million to the U.S. Forest Service, the state and the county to remove more than a million trees in the San Bernardino National Forest killed by drought and bark beetle infestation. He worked with U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein to secure an additional $500 million to reduce the fire danger in the San Bernardino Mountains and throughout Southern California.

Lewis also secured $15 million for a pilot program to refurbish houses repossessed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and providing them to qualified low income families. The program, according to Lewis&#x27; office at the time was successful in Redlands, Highland, and San Bernardino.

===Political positions===
Lewis was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and supported stem-cell research. Lewis considered himself to be pro-life, opposed most public funding of abortions, but encouraged family planning efforts which are opposed by many Roman Catholics. He voted against banning adoption by same-sex couples in the District of Columbia. He thought gun-control efforts should center on stiff prison terms for repeat criminals who use firearms, but was open to considering requiring trigger locks and other child safety measures for law-abiding gun owners. The American Conservative Union gave Lewis&#x27; 2008 voting record 84 out of 100 points. The liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him 0 out of 100 for 2005 (most recent available). Lewis was a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

===Controversies===

In its 2009 report, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) named Lewis one of the 15 most corrupt members of Congress, saying that his &quot;ethics issues stem primarily from the misuse of his position as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee to steer hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks to family and friends in direct exchange for contributions to his campaign committee and political action committee.&quot;

Lewis was also included in the group&#x27;s report in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

In 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice closed the case without filing charges. It was never submitted to federal prosecutors.

==== Military lobbyist relationships ====
Lewis&#x27; aide in charge of tracking defense appropriations, Marine Lt. Col. Carl Kime, was &quot;a military officer on The Pentagon&#x27;s payroll, an apparent violation of House rules and a possible conflict of interest&quot;. U.S. Department of Defense regulations state that military personnel can work on committee staffs but not on the personal staff of an individual member. Kime apparently worked for Lewis since 2001 while being on the Pentagon payroll. Congressional watchdogs call Kime&#x27;s role a conflict of interest and defense experts state that his position may have given the United States Marine Corps greater leverage over contracts and earmarks on the Appropriations Committee.

On February 22, 2006, &quot;The Hill&quot; reported that the Pentagon was recalling Kime from Lewis&#x27;s office. Kime&#x27;s &quot;service for Lewis appeared to violate the Members&#x27; Congressional Handbook issued by the Committee for House Administration, which defines a detailee as a &#x27;non-congressional federal employee assigned to a committee for a period of up to one year.&#x27; The handbook also states that &#x27;detailees may not be assigned to a member office&#x27; and cites the relevant section of U.S. law: 2 USC Section 72a(f).&quot;

==== Barracks Row earmarks ====
In July 2007, &quot;CBS News&quot; reported that since 2004, Lewis had earmarked $2.75 million for the &quot;Barracks Row&quot; area of Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. &quot;Neither I nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project,&quot; Lewis said of the improvements being funded by the earmarks. But the congressman&#x27;s wife, who was also his chief of staff, owns a three-bedroom home valued at $943,000 that is four blocks from the work being paid for by the earmarks. CBS also reported that Tip Tipton, a property owner in the area and a member of the board of directors of the redevelopment project receiving the earmarks, is a top Washington lobbyist who is also a longtime Lewis friend and campaign donor.

==== Loma Linda University ====
From 1998 to 2003, Loma Linda University received $167.2 million in congressional earmarks. That made it the number one academic recipient in the country, with its total nearly $60 million more than the runner up, the University of South Florida. In 2000, Loma Linda University was the single largest recipient of higher education earmarks, at $36 million, largely brought in by Lewis. Several grants were from the U.S. Department of Defense, including $5 million from NASA for space radiation research.

In 2008, Loma Linda University received nearly $9.5 million, of which $5 million came from the Defense Department.

===Committee assignments===
Lewis was chair of the House Republican Conference from 1989 to 1992. In January 1995, he became chairman of the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations subcommittee. He was the first representative from California to be chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. He also served as chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee from 1999 to 2005.

Lewis was the chairman of appropriations committee during the 109th Congress. In the 110th congress and 111th congress, he was the Ranking Member on the committee. He sought the chairmanship for the 112th Congress, but it was instead given to Harold Rogers (R-KY).

<doc id="409658" wikidata="Q781113" url="?curid=409658" title="Gary Miller (politician)">
<text>Gary Gene Miller (born October 16, 1948) is an American politician, who was the U.S. representative for . A Republican, he was first elected in 1998 and served until 2015, when he retired. The district includes most of southern and western San Bernardino County. He previously represented the 42nd district from 1999 to 2013 (numbered as the 41st from 1993 to 2003). In February 2014, Miller announced he would step down at the next election.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Miller was born in Huntsville, Arkansas, but grew up in Whittier, California. He attended Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, California, and served briefly in the United States Army in 1967 being discharged after seven weeks of boot camp at Fort Ord near Monterey.

He is a businessman who founded several companies bearing his name, including G. Miller Development, G. Miller Masonry, and G. Miller Framing. At the age of 20, he began his first company, which built single-family and custom homes. His business expanded to the development of planned communities. Miller remains active in real estate through his development company.

==Early political career (1988–1994)==

===Local politics===
Miller was appointed to the Diamond Bar, California, Municipal Advisory Council in 1988. In 1989, he was elected to the city&#x27;s first council that helped incorporate the city. He served as mayor in 1992.

===State Senate elections===
In 1990, he decided to run for a seat in the California Senate. Incumbent Republican State Senator Bill Campbell of the 31st District resigned the seat. In the February 1990 special election (open primary), Miller ranked fourth, or last, among Republicans in the field, getting just 16% of the vote.

In 1994, he decided to run for the vacant 29th District seat. In the open primary in September 1994, Miller ranked second among Republicans getting 21% of the vote, behind state Assemblyman Dick Mountjoy, who ranked first with 45% of the vote.

==California Assembly (1995–1999)==

===Elections===
In 1995, Miller ran in a special election for a seat in the California State Assembly in the 60th district after incumbent Paul Horcher was recalled. Miller won the open primary with 39% of the vote in a six candidate field.

In 1996, he won re-election defeating Democrat Susan Amaya 53–47%. He was succeeded in the Assembly by Bob Pacheco.

===Committee assignments===
He was Chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1999–2015)==

===Elections===
He was elected to the U.S. House in 1998, defeating incumbent Republican and fellow Diamond Bar resident Jay Kim in the primary and then Democrat Eileen Ansari in the general election with 53 percent. He won again in 2000 with 59 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2002 with 68 percent of the vote. In 2004, he defeated Democrat Lewis Myers with 71.5% of the vote. Similarly, he won in 2008 with 63.8% of the vote, defeating Democrat Ed Chau.

For his first seven terms in Congress, Miller represented a district comprising portions of northern and eastern Orange County, southern Los Angeles County and a small portion of San Bernardino County. After the 2010 United States census, Miller&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 39th district, and pushed further into Orange County, making this already strongly Republican seat even more so. The new map also placed the home of fellow Republican and 10-term incumbent Ed Royce into the 39th, setting up what would have been the only primary contest between two California Republicans. Although the 39th was more Miller&#x27;s district than Royce&#x27;s (Miller retained 53 percent of his former territory), Royce was considered the stronger candidate. Partly due to this, Miller announced in January 2012 that he would run in the newly created 31st district, located entirely in San Bernardino County. Miller&#x27;s move effectively ended the career of House Rules Committee chairman David Dreier, who had represented a large slice of the new 31st. As part of the move, he bought a second home in Rancho Cucamonga, which he now claims as his official residence.

On paper, Miller faced daunting odds. He was running in a district that he had never represented before, had a sizable Democratic lean and was majority-Hispanic. Had it existed in 2008, Barack Obama would have won it with 56 percent of the vote. However, due to California&#x27;s new &quot;top-two&quot; primary system, the three Democrats in the field split the vote, allowing Miller to come in first with only 27 percent of the vote while a fellow Republican, State Senator Bob Dutton, came in second with 25 percent while three Democrats split the remaining 48 percent of the vote. In the general election, Miller defeated Dutton with 55 percent of the vote.

===Tenure===

Transportation and infrastructure

Congressman Miller was the most senior Republican from the California delegation on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. He served on the Highways and Transit; Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials; and Water Resources and Environment Subcommittees.

In 2005, Congressman Miller secured a provision in the 2005 SAFE-TEA LU Highway Reauthorization that initiated a pilot program where 5 states, including California would assume the responsibility for conducting the federal environmental review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In California, the NEPA pilot program has shaved 17 months off of environmental review processes and 30 months off of overall project delivery.

;Streamlining regulations and review for transportation projects
During the 112th Congress, Miller introduced legislation to build off the success of the 2005 pilot program to further improve highway project delivery by eliminating bureaucratic red tape and restoring greater control to state and local governments.

In June 2011, he introduced the Environmental Review Cooperation Act, which would make permanent a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) pilot program that authorizes five states—including California—to take on the responsibility of complying with NEPA for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funded projects. The bill would also expand the program to all states that have environmental standards that are equal to or exceed federal requirements.

In August 2011, Congressman Miller introduced the Breaking Down Barriers Act, which provides common sense proposals to make highway project delivery more efficient. HR 2766, The Breaking Down Barriers Act includes language that allows transportation agencies to move forward on construction activities prior to receiving grant funds, and requires prompt action by federal agencies by establishing deadlines for project approvals.

;Energy
During the 111th Congress, Congressman Miller introduced a comprehensive energy bill that would reduce regulatory burdens that delay improvements and advancements in domestic energy production. The bill would open U.S. coastal waters for drilling, allow states to share a portion of the revenue derived from such drilling, and use the earnings from offshore drilling to pay down the national debt. The legislation also included energy tax incentives for wind, solar, biodiesel, clean coal technologies and other forms of energy. Congressman Miller stated his resolution and plan to lower gas prices and work for a long-term solution for the country.

In 2010 Miller signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.

;Animal welfare
During the 111th and 112th Congresses, Congressman Miller cosponsored the Puppy Uniform Protection Statute (PUPS) Act, which sets out to close loopholes in the 1966 law that allows breeders to sell puppies over the Internet without federal oversight. Specifically, this legislation requires any breeder who sells or offers to sell more than 50 dogs annually directly to the public, including over the Internet, to be licensed and inspected. The bill would also require that dogs in commercial breeding facilities have appropriate space and daily exercise.

Congressman Miller was an original cosponsor of legislation in the 111th Congress to prohibit knowingly selling or offering to sell videos of animal crush videos in interstate or foreign commerce for commercial gain. This legislation, H.R. 5566, the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act, was signed into law on December 9, 2010. In the 110th Congress, he sponsored the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, which imposes a fine and up to three years in jail for violations of the Animal Welfare Act related to sponsoring or exhibiting animals in an animal fighting venture and for buying, selling, or transporting any animal for participation in an animal fighting venture. This legislation became law on May 3, 2007.

;Supporting breast cancer research
Congressman Miller cosponsored legislation supporting Breast Cancer Deadline 2020, a call to action for policymakers, researchers, breast cancer advocates, and other stakeholders to end the disease by the end of the decade. H.R. 3067 would create a commission to identify promising research, encourage partnerships between government and the private sector, and create opportunities for trans-disciplinary collaboration that may advance the mission of ending breast cancer. Congressman Miller also cosponsored H.R. 466, legislation to reauthorize the sale of the Breast Cancer Stamp, with proceeds from the stamp going to the National Institute of Health to fund breast cancer research. Congressman Miller is also a long time supporter of the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program.

During the 111th and 112th Congresses, Congressman Miller sent a letter to House Appropriations Committee requesting that appropriators include $120 million for the Department of Defense (DOD) Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP) in defense appropriations legislation.

;Veterans
Congressman Miller supports continuing the extension of benefits to all veterans of the armed services of the United States. During the 112th Congress, Congressman Miller cosponsored the Veteran Skills to Jobs Act, which addresses the high rate of veteran unemployment by streamlining the bureaucratic processes for veterans with relevant training to get jobs when they return home. Specifically, H.R. 4155 would direct federal agencies to view relevant military training as the equivalent of federal licensing and certification requirements.

Congressman Miller also cosponsored H.R. 178, legislation to repeal the so-called &quot;Widow&#x27;s Tax&quot; and ensure military widows and families of military heroes will be fully protected. H.R. 178, also known as the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act, would repeal current law that requires a dollar-for-dollar deduction of VA benefits for service connected deaths from military survivors&#x27; Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuity.

Anti-terrorism

In 2005, Miller cosponsored the Border Protection, Anti-terrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 (H.R. 4437) with representative Jim Sensenbrenner. In 2006, after widespread demonstrations by immigrants, Miller wrote: &quot;Too bad their protest didn&#x27;t include giving up government-paid social services—because a day without illegal aliens would be a boon to U.S. taxpayers.&quot;

Miller backed the development of a rail link between Ontario and Anaheim, part of a proposed line between Orange County and Las Vegas. &quot;Once completed, there would be no need for an airport in south Orange County, and the Inland Empire will reap the economic benefits as a true transportation hub,&quot; Miller said.

Miller, a history buff, become involved in the preservation of Civil War battlefields, after he played a bit part in the 2003 movie &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;.

Miller signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

In 2011, Miller voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.

;Allegation of sheltering profits of real estate sales
Miller sold to the city of Monrovia, in 2002, making profit of more than $10 million. Normally, he would have had to pay state and federal taxes of up to 31% on that profit.

Miller told the Internal Revenue Service and the state of California that Monrovia had forced him to sell the property under threat of eminent domain. That allowed him to shelter the profits from capital gains taxes for more than two years before he had to reinvest the money.

Monrovia officials stated that Miller sold the land willingly and that they didn&#x27;t threaten to force him to sell. A videotape of a February 2000 City Council meeting shows Miller asking city officials four times to buy his land. Another, earlier videotape confirmed Miller&#x27;s position that the city had refused to let him develop the land and threatened &quot;condemnation&quot; of his property for public use. Although all early drafts of Monrovia&#x27;s sales contract with Miller included the phrase &quot;friendly condemnation&quot;, it was deleted when the final deal was made. Miller and his wife signed an amendment to the escrow instructions on August 1, 2002, saying, &quot;condemnation deleted&quot;, or no longer in effect.

Miller took an exemption again in 2005 when he sold the 10 lots to the city of Fontana and again in 2006 when he sold a building to Fontana, claiming both were compulsory sales. The lots and building had been purchased in late 2004 with proceeds from the Monrovia sale. Such exemptions gave him another two years after each sale to reinvest the funds without paying capital gains taxes.

In each case, those involved in the purchases say eminent domain was neither used nor threatened. On January 31, 2007, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Miller&#x27;s transactions are being investigated by the FBI.

Miller declined to comment on the sales. The FBI also declined to comment. As of 2008, no investigation or legal action could be confirmed.

;2005 profits from dealings with business partner and federal transportation bill
As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Miller pushed for a provision in the 2005 transportation bill that allowed the city of Rialto to close its airport, the first time an act of Congress has ever shuttered an airport. It is a power the Federal Aviation Administration traditionally has had sole authority to exercise. The closing of the airport paved the way for Lewis Operating, a business partner and campaign contributor, to win a multimillion-dollar contract from the city to develop the airport land and build a planned community consisting of 2,500 homes, parks and of retail space on the former airport and adjacent land.

Miller also helped secure $1.28 million in that bill for street improvements in front of a planned housing and retail center, including a Target store that he co-owned with Lewis Operating.

Miller took out nearly $7.5 million in promissory notes in 2004 from Lewis Operating, which he used to purchase land from the company. In 2005, he sold some of that land to a part of the company, making a profit of between $1.1 million and $6 million, according to his financial disclosure report (which requires reporting a dollar range, not an exact dollar figure). The majority of the parcels that Miller bought are about two miles (3 km) from the airport.

House Rules explicitly state that before entering into loans from an entity other than a financial institution, members of Congress and staff must submit the terms of the loans for review and a determination from the ethics committee on whether the loan is acceptable under the gift rule. It is not clear if Miller complied with this requirement.

;December 2006 allegations
In December 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Miller had used &quot;congressional muscle&quot; for &quot;personal business matters&quot;. This included having congressional staff do Miller&#x27;s personal errands, collecting nearly $25,000 a year in rent from his campaign committee, using the offices of his real estate development firm as his campaign office, and ordering an aide to find a way to get a city business-friendly council member on the National Park Board who was involved in a city purchase of Miller&#x27;s property.

;May 2010 allegations
In May 2010, the &quot;FOX&quot; affiliate MyFOXLA interviewed Miller over claims led by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) stating he &quot;directed millions of dollars in government money to non-profits headed by one of his campaign contributor[s], developer Jeffrey Burum&quot;. Burum, his company, and his wife donated $26,350 to Miller&#x27;s campaign for what CREW alleges is over a million dollars in congressional earmarks kicked back to Burum&#x27;s non-profit &quot;Hope Through Housing Foundation.&quot;

== Controversies ==

=== Accusation of sexual harassment ===
Rebecca Weir, a former staff member of Miller, claimed that he asked her to &quot;twirl for him&quot; after a meeting. According to Weir, &quot;He said, ‘My God, you look amazing today. Just stunning.’ And he was kind of leering at me, and then he asked me to twirl,&quot;. Soon after the incident, Miller&#x27;s chief of staff called Weir to offer an ad-hoc bonus as instructed by Miller.

==Personal life==
Miller and his wife, Cathy, have three sons and one daughter.

===Abduction of grandchildren===
On November 19, 2007, three of Miller&#x27;s grandsons, Brian (8) and twins Evan and Christian (6), did not show for a scheduled joint-custody visit with their grandparents, the Millers. The Millers accused the boys&#x27; mother, Jennifer Lopez DeJongh, of abducting the children. DeJongh was divorced from Miller&#x27;s son, Brian Miller, and the two were in dispute over certain custodial rights regarding medical and educational decisions for the children. Brian had previously pled guilty in 2000 to charges of spousal and child abuse. In 2006, prosecutors allowed him to change his plea to not guilty and dismissed the case after he completed probation, a parenting class, and 224 hours of community service. In August 2011, DeJongh and the boys were located in Mexicali, Mexico. DeJongh was charged with three counts of child custody deprivation in Los Angeles County, but federal charges of flight to avoid prosecution were dropped following her extradition. The children were reunited with the Miller family. Congressman Miller commented that, &quot;My wife and I are extremely relieved that after more than 3 1/2 years our grandchildren have been found unharmed and returned safely to the United States&quot; and that he was &quot;eternally grateful&quot; to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Mexican authorities and &quot;all those whose hard work and unwavering dedication made this possible&quot;.

<text>Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger (8 May 1894 – 10 May 1945) was a German paramilitary commander in charge of, and personally involved in progressive annihilation of the Polish nation, its culture, its heritage and its wealth. Long before the war he was a high-ranking member of the SA and the SS. Between 1939 and 1943 he was the Higher SS and Police Leader in the General Government, giving him command of all police and security forces in German-occupied Poland. In this capacity, he organized and supervised numerous crimes against humanity and had major responsibility for the German genocide of the Polish nation: the extermination of six million Poles (three million of them Polish Jews) and massive destruction, degradation and impoverishment of the Polish state. He took his own life in May 1945.

==Career==
Krüger was born in 1894 into a military family in Straßburg, Alsace-Lorraine, then part of the German Empire (today, Strasbourg, France) He and Walter Krüger were siblings (By Friedrich Being the Younger Brother in the Family).He attended the &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Rastatt and then pursued a military career as a cadet in the military school at Karlsruhe and the military academy at Gross-Lichterfelde. In June 1914, Krüger was commissioned a &quot;Leutnant&quot; in the Imperial German Army&#x27;s 25th Royal Prussian Infantry Regiment. During the First World War, he served as a platoon leader, a company commander and the regimental adjutant. He was wounded three times, promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; and awarded the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class. In August 1919, he joined the , which he left in March 1920. He then entered civilian employment as a clerk to a bookseller and to a publisher until 1922. He got married, went to work for a waste disposal firm from 1924 to 1928 and then became a self-employed businessman.

===Activities in SA and SS===
While working at the refuse company, he probably met Kurt Daluege, who was an engineer at the company at that time and who later became SS commander in Berlin and leader of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (order police) or Orpo. The two men soon formed a friendship. On 15 November 1929, Krüger joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) as member 171,199. On 1 February 1931, he also joined the SS (member number 6,123), which he left in April to transfer to the SA. With the help of Daluege, Krüger began a rapid rise in the SA ranks. He was promoted to SA-&quot;Oberführer&quot; (31 July 1931) and SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; (10 September 1931). He commanded the SA-&quot;Gruppe Ost&quot;, encompassing the Berlin area, from April 1931 to July 1932. In July 1932 he was made leader of the Group Staff in the supreme SA leadership under SA-&quot;Stabschef&quot; Ernst Röhm, and he served as the SA representative to the Reich Defense Council. In October 1932, he became a member of the State Board for Youth Physical Training.

On 27 June 1933, Krüger was promoted to SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; and appointed chief of &quot;Ausbildungswesen&quot; (Training). Cooperating closely with the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, he used his new position to school the SA&#x27;s recruits (an estimated 250,000) to become unit leaders. Krüger was not caught in the Night of the Long Knives, in which Röhm and many other high-ranking SA members were killed, and it has been speculated that his switch from the SS to the SA was only for pragmatic reasons, especially in the light of Krüger transferring the SA armouries of which he was in charge to the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; as soon as the purge began. 

On 25 January 1935, Krüger re-entered the SS, was given the rank of SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; and placed on &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s personal staff. In February 1936, he was appointed Inspector of Border Guard Units. On 16 May 1938, he was named Inspector of SS Mounted Units. 

Throughout these years, Krüger also pursued a political career within the Nazi Party. At the July 1932 election, he won a seat in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 5 (Frankfurt an der Oder) and, on 10 July 1933, he was made a member of the Prussian State Council. He would hold these seats until the fall of the Nazi regime. Also he served a term as a District Councillor (&quot;Rattsherr&quot;) in Berlin from 1933 through 1935. In July 1937, he was given a seat on the People&#x27;s Court and he was appointed the Reich Supreme Authority for Equestrian Sports in January 1939.

===Crimes in Poland===

On 4 October 1939, Himmler appointed Krüger as the Higher SS and Police Leader (&quot;Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer&quot;, HSSPF) to the German military administration in Łódź. This was rapidly followed on 26 October by his formal appointment as HSSPF &quot;Ost&quot; to the part of German-occupied Poland organized into the General Government, with headquarters in Kraków. Krüger thus held the highest police and security post in occupied Poland.

During the first months of the war in Poland, he was one of the coordinators of Action AB - the mass murder by shooting of Polish intelligentsia, which was performed by Orpo or ethnic Germans (&quot;Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz&quot;). The victims were mainly University lecturers, retired military officers, high-rank policemen, managing staff of the Polish State Railways, journalists, businessmen, landowners, notable Catholic priests, internationally known sportsmen (vide Janusz Kusociński), judges, teachers, social workers, senior administrative officials or other members of Polish intellectual elite.

Already in November 1939, Krüger had fulfilled Hitler&#x27;s personal order, and 184 professors of Jagiellonian University were arrested in the &quot;Sonderaktion Krakau&quot; action and deported on a cattle train to Sachsenhausen concentration camp; fewer than 50 of the professors survived the war.

From the very beginning he introduced the terror on a large scale. For every killed German in General Government by Home Army, ten random Polish civilians were shot. Regular arrests of Polish inhabitants of Warsaw, during the street Razzia () and transporting them to the Third Reich to do slave labor for German industry (for among others: Krupp, Audi, IG Farben, Porsche, Volkswagen...), or straight to concentration camps, were organized on his orders.

The deportation to the concentration camp was practically equal to the death sentence. One of the men from units subordinated to Krüger: SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; (captain) Karl Fritzsch, the deputy (&quot;Schutzhaftlagerführer&quot;) Auschwitz commander, once said to a new &quot;transport&quot; of Polish prisoners:

The collective responsibility was the new law introduced by SS. If someone in the family committed an act against the new rules (for example: failure to comply with the curfew), all the members of the family were sent to concentration camp. In the case, when a serious disobedience was committed by a farmer, the whole village was under process of pacification (mass execution by burning).

Due to harsh &quot;politics&quot; of the occupiers, the shortage of the food and medications in the cities and towns was extreme. The Poles were starving (average food allocation amounted to 2,600 calories for Germans, 700 for Poles and 400 for Jews). The worst situation was in the ghettos, where the mortality was much higher than among &quot;free&quot; Poles. Farmers in GG were obliged to deliver draconian amount of grain, meat, milk and potatoes, which were sent straight to Germany. No pay was given to the victims. Just in the year 1942–1943 around 633,000 tons of the grain were confiscated from Polish villages. In the Autumn period of 1944 nearly 388,000 tons of potatoes were stolen. The contingents were taken by force and in the whole process military or para-military forces were used, acting on orders of local SS or police commander. In the case of refusal to deliver on time, severe punishments like beatings or arrests were applied. Some of them were resulting in sending to a concentration camps. All sorts of repressions were introduced, including the death penalty (without formal accusation or a lawful trial).

To terrorize the population - on SS commanders&#x27; orders - public executions by shooting or hanging were conducted.

The systematic process of kidnapping around 200,000 children from Polish families for further Germanisation was also Krüger&#x27;s domain.

People disabled mentally or with Down syndrome were secretly killed by the authorities (mainly by Sicherheitspolizei). Later on, the gas vans were invented by German doctor of chemistry and SS-&quot;Untersturmführer&quot; August Becker (not subordinated to Krüger), to make the whole process faster, more discreet and taking the burden of participating in a mass shootings from ordinary soldiers.

Krüger supervised the action of destroying Polish historical buildings (without military significance), cultural sites and in general Polish culture - both by stealing the art works or - if they were related to Polish history - burning some of them on the spot (vide: medieval synagogue). More than 500,000 of Polish and international (paintings by da Vinci, Raphael or Rembrandt) piece of arts were stolen. Most of them never come back to Poland after the war. Some of the goods - crucial to Polish cultural heritage like paintings: Battle of Grunwald or Prussian Homage, were hidden in a local farms. If they were seized by the occupiers, they would be destroyed as anti-German. Policies aimed at cultural genocide resulted in the deaths of thousands of scholars and artists, and the theft and destruction of innumerable cultural artifacts.

All Polish theatres were disbanded, likewise all universities were shut, and the secondary schools were teaching only basics. Lessons of history, geography and the Polish literature ceased to be performed. The primary education in the countryside was not allowed during the next five years, leaving - in 1945 - a couple of million teenagers, barely able to write and read. In Galicia for every book given to the German authorities, a bottle of alcohol was the pay (one of the assumptions of the Generalplan Ost). The plan was originating from Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s operations against - among others - Poles, mainly in Provinz Posen (Greater Poland) in the 19th century. 

Once Bismarck wrote to his sister in 1861: 

Reichsführer SS expressed the German doctrine against &quot;Untermenschen&quot; by these words:



As the highest commander in charge he looked after the execution of Operation Harvest Festival in district of Lublin, when during one day in November 1943 SS, Order Police (101st Police Battalion from Hamburg volunteered for this operation) and the Ukrainian &quot;Sonderdienst&quot; shot to death in mass killings more than 83,000 Jews. Krüger&#x27;s men, hand-in-hand with Order Police battalions, &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; and Wehrmacht were conducting during a few years time, the genocide program of quelling guerrilla activity, so-called: &quot;anti-partisan&quot; fighting in the General Government. During these operations, which meant to be against Polish &quot;bandits&quot;, as the Germans called partisans, the murders of women and children were carried out on a daily basis. For a help given to the partisans by local farmers and their families, the entire villages were burnt to the ashes with all inhabitants (so-called pacification action).

Such &quot;disciplinary&quot; campaigns were a commonplace in Poland under German occupation - more than 300 Polish villages were destroyed (within the borders after 1945). In the most of cases, before the fire was set to the village, all the peasants were gathered in the biggest village building and burnt alive. Earlier, several grenades were thrown into the crowd.

Among other deeds committed by Krüger were: responsibility for eliminating rebellions in the extermination camps, providing victims for the medical experiments typically resulting in the death or permanent disability, setting up forced labour camps, the employment of police and SS in the deportations of Jews from ghettos in General Government to extermination camps.

He was in charge of driving out (ethnic cleansing) of over 116,000 Polish farmers (30 thousands of them were children) from the area around Zamość, known as Aktion Zamosc. Most of the children were sent to concentrations camps and to labor camps. Blond and sufficiently young were being sent to the III Reich to be Germanised, or work as slaves for German industry or farms. Only 800 were successfully reclaimed after the war. 

Disagreements with governor general Hans Frank led to Krüger&#x27;s dismissal on 9 November 1943. He was replaced by Wilhelm Koppe.

Due to Krüger, Koppe and their troops and policemen, altogether more than 6 million Poles (2.9 million of them were Polish Jews) were killed in gas chambers, in forced labour camps, during mass shootings, from hunger, disease, cold or because of mandatory expulsions from their houses or farms, and transportation of these empty-handed victims on the bare fields of General Government. Almost the entire population of Polish Jews was exterminated. Travelling Roma were treated by German authority equally to Jews (Romani genocide).

The economical downfall of the Polish industry, the railway network, the agriculture, the forestry and total destruction of the country (the retreating Germans blew up Polish sea port in Gdynia) were not in connection with the military actions only. Most of the victims have perished due to political doctrine, classifying all the Slavic nations as subhumans, and other administrative and compulsory orders and restrictions set up by the new government, with SS-Obergruppenführer Krüger as the most senior commander of SS and Police in German-occupied Poland.

I have nothing against - after the war will be won - the extermination of all this Slavic mob.

The Polish Secret State ordered his death, but an assassination attempt on 20 April 1943 in Kraków failed when two bombs hurled at his car missed the target.

Six months later, he wrote in a letter:
===Later career and suicide===
From November 1943 until April 1944 Krüger served with the SS Division Prinz Eugen conducting Nazi security warfare in occupied Yugoslavia. While ostensibly engaged in anti-partisan fight in Yugoslavia, this unit became notorious for committing atrocities against the civilian population.

On 8 July 1944, Krüger was given the rank of &quot;General der Waffen-SS&quot;. From June to August he took over the command over the SS Division Nord in northern Finland. From August 1944 until February 1945 Krüger was commanding general of the V SS Mountain Corps. In February 1945 he was Himmler&#x27;s representative at the German southeast front and in April and May 1945 he was commander of a combat unit of the Orpo at Army Group South (known as Army Group Ostmark after 1 May 1945). At the end of the war Krüger took his own life in Upper Austria.

<text>The original Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&amp;P RW, sometimes called &quot;Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway&quot;) was an American Class I railroad. It was also known as the Rock Island Line, or, in its final years, The Rock.

At the end of 1970, it operated 7,183 miles of road on 10,669 miles of track; that year it reported 20,557 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 118 million passenger miles. (Those totals may or may not include the former Burlington-Rock Island Railroad.)

The song &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;, a spiritual from the late 1920s first recorded in 1934, was inspired by the railway.

==History==

===Incorporation===
Its predecessor, the Rock Island and La Salle Railroad Company, was incorporated in Illinois on February 27, 1847, and an amended charter was approved on February 7, 1851, as the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad. Construction began in Chicago on October 1, 1851, and the first train was operated on October 10, 1852, between Chicago and Joliet. Construction continued on through La Salle, and Rock Island was reached on February 22, 1854, becoming the first railroad to connect Chicago with the Mississippi River.

In Iowa, the C&amp;RI&#x27;s incorporators created (on February 5, 1853) the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company (M&amp;M), to run from Davenport to Council Bluffs, and on November 20, 1855, the first train to operate in Iowa steamed from Davenport to Muscatine. The Mississippi River bridge between Rock Island and Davenport was completed on April 22, 1856.

In 1857, the steamboat &quot;Effie Afton&quot; ran into the Rock Island&#x27;s Mississippi River Bridge. The steamboat was overcome by a fire, which also destroyed a span of the bridge. This accident caused a series of court cases. In one of the cases, Abraham Lincoln, a lawyer at the time, represented the Rock Island. Lincoln argued that not only was the steamboat at fault in striking the bridge, but that bridges across navigable rivers were to the advantage of the country.

The M&amp;M was acquired by the C&amp;RI on July 9, 1866, to form the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Company. In 1877 Ransom Reed Cable became a director and in 1883 replaced Hugh Riddle as president, retiring as Chairman of the Board in 1902. The railroad expanded through construction and acquisitions in the following decades.

On March 21, 1910, the Green Mountain train wreck resulted when a Rock Island Railroad passenger train derailed, killing 52 passengers and severely injuring scores of others.

The railroad retired its last steam locomotive from service in 1953.

===Territory===
The Rock Island stretched across Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas. The easternmost reach of the system was Chicago, and the system also reached Memphis, Tennessee. To the west, it reached Denver, Colorado, and Santa Rosa, New Mexico. Southernmost reaches were to Galveston, Texas, and Eunice, Louisiana, while in a northerly direction, the Rock Island got as far as Minneapolis, Minnesota. Major lines included Minneapolis to Kansas City, Missouri, via Des Moines, Iowa; St. Louis, Missouri Meta, Missouri, to Santa Rosa via Kansas City; Herington, Kansas, to Galveston, Texas, via Fort Worth, Texas, and Dallas, Texas; and Santa Rosa to Memphis. The heaviest traffic was on the Chicago-to-Rock Island and Rock Island-to-Muscatine lines.

===Intercity passenger service===
In common with most American railroad companies, the Rock Island once operated an extensive passenger service. The primary routes served were: Chicago-Los Angeles, Chicago-Denver, Memphis-Little Rock-Oklahoma City-Tucumcari, and Minneapolis-Dallas. The Rock Island ran both limited and local service on those routes, as well as locals on many other lines on its system. In 1937, the Rock Island introduced diesel power to its passenger service, with the purchase of six lightweight &quot;Rocket&quot; streamliners.

 In competition with the Santa Fe Chiefs, the Rock Island jointly operated the &quot;Golden State Limited&quot; (Chicago—Kansas City—Tucumcari—El Paso—Los Angeles) with the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) from 1902 to 1968. On this route, the Rock Island&#x27;s train was marketed as a &quot;low-altitude&quot; crossing of the Continental Divide. The Rock Island did not concede to the Santa Fe&#x27;s dominance in the Chicago–Los Angeles travel market and re-equipped the train with new streamlined equipment in 1948. At the same time, the &quot;Limited&quot; was dropped from the train&#x27;s name and the train was thereafter known as the &quot;Golden State&quot;. The local run on this line was known as the &quot;Imperial,&quot; which had a branch operating through the northwestern edge of Mexico.

The 1948 modernization of the &quot;Golden State&quot; occurred with some controversy. In 1947, both the Rock Island and Southern Pacific jointly advertised the coming of a new entry in the Chicago-Los Angeles travel market. The &quot;Golden Rocket&quot; was scheduled to closely match the Santa Fe&#x27;s transit time end-to-end and was to have its own dedicated trainsets, one purchased by the Rock Island, the other by Southern Pacific. As the Rock Island&#x27;s set of streamlined passenger cars was being finished, the Southern Pacific abruptly withdrew its purchase. The Rock Island&#x27;s cars were delivered and found their way into the &quot;Golden State&quot;&#x27;s fleet soon after delivery.

The &quot;Golden State&quot; was the last first-class train on the Rock Island, retaining its dining cars and sleeping cars until its last run on February 21, 1968.

The Rock Island also competed with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroad in the Chicago-to-Denver market. While the Q fielded its Zephyrs on the route, the Rock Island ran the &quot;Rocky Mountain Rocket&quot;. The &quot;RMR&quot; split at Limon, Colorado, with half the train diverting to Colorado Springs, an operation known as the &quot;Limon Shuffle&quot;. The Rock Island conceded nothing to its rival, even installing ABS signaling on the route west of Lincoln in an effort to maintain transit speed. The train was also re-equipped with streamlined equipment in 1948.

As the &quot;Rocky Mountain Rocket&quot; was downgraded due to nonrail competition, the route traveled by the train was gradually shortened from 1966 onward. Its western terminus was cut back first to Omaha, then to Council Bluffs. After briefly running without a name, it was renamed &quot;The Cornhusker&quot;. Finally, in 1970, the train was cut back to a Chicago-Rock Island run entirely within the confines of the state of Illinois and renamed the &quot;Quad Cities Rocket&quot;.

Other trains operated by the Rock Island as part of its Rocket fleet included the &quot;Corn Belt Rocket&quot; (Chicago—Des Moines—Omaha), the &quot;Des Moines-Omaha Limited&quot; (Chicago-Des Moines-Omaha), the &quot;Twin Star Rocket&quot; (Minneapolis—St. Paul—Des Moines—Kansas City—Oklahoma City—Fort Worth—Dallas—Houston), the &quot;Zephyr Rocket&quot; (Minneapolis—St. Paul—Burlington—St. Louis), the &quot;Choctaw Rocket&quot; (Memphis—Little Rock—Oklahoma City—Amarillo) and the &quot;Cherokee&quot; (a local counterpart to the &quot;Choctaw Rocket&quot;, Memphis-Little Rock-Oklahoma City-Amarillo-Tucumcari-Los Angeles).
By the time Amtrak was formed in 1971, the once-proud Rock Island was down to just two intercity trains, the Chicago-Peoria &quot;Peoria Rocket&quot; and the Chicago-Rock Island &quot;Quad Cities Rocket,&quot; both of which now operated entirely within the borders of Illinois. However, the Rock Island opted against joining Amtrak, in part because the government assessed the Amtrak entrance fee based upon passenger miles operated in 1970. After concluding that the cost of joining would be greater than remaining in the passenger business, the railroad decided to &quot;perform a public service for the state of Illinois&quot; and continue intercity passenger operations. To help manage the service, the Rock Island hired National Association of Railroad Passengers founder Anthony Haswell as managing director of passenger services.

The last two trains plied the Rock Island&#x27;s Illinois Division as the track quality declined from 1971 through 1977. The transit times, once a speedy 2½ hours in the 1950s, had lengthened to a 4½ hour run by 1975. The State of Illinois continued to subsidize the service to keep it running. The track program of 1978 helped with main-line timekeeping, although the Rock Island&#x27;s management decreed that the two trains were not to delay freight traffic on the route. By this time, both once-proud trains were down to just two coaches, powered by EMD E8 locomotives entering their second decade of service. With the trains frequently running with as many paying passengers as coaches in the train, Illinois withdrew its subsidy, and the two trains made their final runs on December 31, 1978.

===Chicago commuter service===

The Rock Island also operated an extensive commuter train service in the Chicago area. The primary route ran from LaSalle Street Station to Joliet along the main line, and a spur line, known as the &quot;Suburban Line&quot; to Blue Island. The main-line trains supplanted the long-distance services that did not stop at the numerous stations on that route. The Suburban Line served the Beverly area of Chicago as a branch leaving the main line at Gresham and heading due west, paralleling the Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad passenger line before turning south. The Suburban Line made stops every four blocks along the way before rejoining the main line at Western Avenue Junction in Blue Island.

From the 1920s on, the suburban services were operated using Pacific-type 4-6-2 locomotives and specially designed light-heavyweight coaches that with their late 1920s build dates became known as the &quot;Capone&quot; cars. The suburban service became well known in the diesel era, as the steam power was replaced, first with new EMD FP7s and ALCO RS-3s, with two Fairbanks-Morse units added later. In 1949, Pullman-built 2700-series cars arrived as the first air-conditioned commuter cars on the line.

In the 1960s, the Rock Island tried to upgrade the suburban service with newer equipment at lower cost. Second-hand Aerotrains, while less than successful in intercity service, were purchased to provide further air-conditioned accommodations that had proven popular with the 2700 series cars.

When the Milwaukee Road purchased new Budd Company stainless-steel, bilevel cars in 1961, the Rock Island elected to add to a subsequent order and took delivery of its first bilevel equipment in 1964. Power for these new cars was provided by orphaned passenger units: three EMD F7s, an EMD E6, and the two EMD AB6s. The engines were rebuilt with head end power to provide heat, air conditioning, and lighting for the new cars. In 1970, another order, this time for Pullman-built bilevel cars arrived to further supplement the fleet. To provide the power for these cars, several former Union Pacific EMD E8 and EMD E9 diesels were also rebuilt with head end power and added to the commuter pool.

The commuter service was not exempt from the general decline of the Rock Island through the 1970s. Over time, deferred maintenance took its toll on both track and rolling stock. On the Rock Island, the Capone cars were entering their sixth decade of service and the nearly 30-year-old 2700s suffered from severe corrosion due to the steel used in their construction. LaSalle Street Station, the service&#x27;s downtown terminal, suffered from neglect and urban decay with the slab roof of the train shed literally falling apart, requiring its removal. By this time, the Rock Island could not afford to replace the clearly worn-out equipment.

In 1976, the entire Chicago commuter rail system began to receive financial support from the state of Illinois through the Regional Transportation Authority. Operating funds were disbursed to all commuter operators, and the Rock Island was to be provided with new equipment to replace the tired 2700 series and Capone cars. New Budd bilevels that were near copies of the 1961 Milwaukee Road cars arrived in 1978. New EMD F40PH units arrived in late 1977 and, in summer, 1978, briefly could be seen hauling Capone cars. The Rock Island&#x27;s commuter F and E units were relegated to freight service or the scrapyard.

With the 1980 end of the Rock Island, the RTA purchased the suburban territory and remaining Rock Island commuter equipment from the estate, while the Chicago and North Western Railway took over operations for a year before the RTA began operating it directly in 1981. LaSalle Street Station was torn down and replaced with the Chicago Stock Exchange building, with a smaller commuter station located one block south of the old station. The RTA gradually rebuilt the track and added more new equipment to the service, leaving the property in better shape than it was in the Rock Island&#x27;s heyday, albeit with less track. The Rock Island District, as the Rock Island&#x27;s suburban service is now known, now operates as part of Metra, the Chicago commuter rail agency.

===Rock Island&#x27;s survival challenge===

The Rock Island hit its peak under the presidency of John Dew Farrington, from 1948 to 1955. As the aura from those days waned in the late 1950s, the Rock Island found itself faced with flat traffic, revenues, and increasing costs. Despite this, the property was still in decent shape, making the Rock Island an attractive bride for another line looking to expand the reach of their current system.

The Rock Island was known as &quot;one railroad too many&quot; in the plains states, basically serving the same territory as the Burlington, only over a longer route. The Midwest rail network had been built in the late 19th century to serve that era&#x27;s traffic. The mechanization of grain hauling gave larger reach to large grain elevators, reducing the need for the tight web of track that crisscrossed the plains states such as Iowa. As for available overhead traffic, in 1958, no less than six Class I carriers were serving as eastern connections for the Union Pacific at Omaha, all seeking a slice of the flood of western traffic that UP interchanged there. Under the ICC revenue rules in place at the time, the Rock Island sought traffic from Omaha, yet preferred to keep the long haul to Denver, where interchange could be made with the Denver and Rio Grande Western, a connection to the Western Pacific for haulage to the West Coast.

The only option for the Rock Island to grow revenues and absorb costs was to merge with another, perhaps more prosperous railroad. Overtures were made from fellow Midwest granger line C&amp;NW, as well as the granger turned transcon Milwaukee Road. Both of these never advanced much beyond the data gathering and initial study phases. In 1964, its last profitable year, the Rock Island agreed to pursue a merger plan with the UP, which would form one large &quot;super&quot; railroad stretching from Chicago to the West Coast.

Facing the loss of the UP&#x27;s traffic at the Omaha gateway, virtually every railroad directly and indirectly affected by the potential UP/Rock Island merger immediately filed protests to block it. With these filings began the longest and most complicated merger case in Interstate Commerce Commission history. Faced with failing granger railroads and large Class I railroads seeking to expand, ICC Hearing Examiner Nathan Klitenic, presiding over the case, sought to balance the opposing forces and completely restructure the railroads west of the Mississippi River.

===The UP-RI merger case===
After 10 years of hearings and tens of thousands of pages of testimony and exhibits produced, Klitenic, now an administrative law judge, approved the Rock Island-Union Pacific merger as part of a larger plan for rail service throughout the West. Under Klitenic&#x27;s proposal, almost all of the Rock Island, including the Chicago-Omaha main line, would go to the Union Pacific. The Kansas City-Tucumcari &quot;Golden State&quot; route would be sold to the Southern Pacific. The Memphis-Amarillo &quot;Choctaw&quot; route would be sold to the Santa Fe. The Rio Grande would have an option to purchase the Denver-Kansas City line.

During most of the ensuing merger process, Rock Island operated at a financial loss. In 1965, Rock Island earned its last profit. With the merger with Union Pacific seemingly so close, the Rock Island cut expenses to conserve cash. Expenditures on track maintenance were cut, passenger service was reduced as fast as the ICC would allow, and locomotives received only basic maintenance to keep them running. The Rock Island began to take on a ramshackle appearance and derailments occurred with increasing frequency. In an effort to prop up its future merger mate, UP asked the Rock Island to forsake the Denver gateway in favor of increased interchange at Omaha. Incredibly, the Rock Island refused this, and the UP routed more Omaha traffic over the Chicago and North Western.

As a result, by 1974, the Rock Island was no longer the attractive prospect it had once been in the 1950s. The cost-cutting measures enacted to conserve cash for the merger left the Rock Island property in such a state that the Union Pacific viewed the expense of bringing it back to viable operating condition to be severely prohibitive. Additionally, the ICC attached conditions for both labor and operating concessions that the UP deemed too excessive for their tastes. These factors led the Union Pacific to walk away from the deal later in 1974.

From the vantage point of the 1974 railroad industry, Klitenic&#x27;s plan was viewed as an unmanageable and far too radical solution to both the granger railroad issue and the larger issue of the future of rail freight transportation in general. The visionary plan would not be realized until the megamergers of the 1990s with the BNSF Railway and Union Pacific remaining as the two surviving major rail carriers west of the Mississippi.

===The Rock Island&#x27;s last attempt to survive===

Now set free and adrift, both operationally and financially, the Rock Island assessed its options. It hired a new president and CEO, John W. Ingram, a former Federal Railway Administration (FRA) official. Ingram quickly sought to improve efficiency and sought FRA loans for the rebuild of the line, but finances caught up with the Rock Island all too quickly. With only $300 of cash on hand, on March 17, 1975, Rock Island entered its third bankruptcy under Chapter 77 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. William M. Gibbons was selected as receiver and trustee by Judge Frank J. McGarr, with whom Gibbons had practiced law in the early 1960s.

With its debts on hold, Rock Island charted a new course as a grain funnel from the Midwest to the port of Galveston, Texas. The Ingram administration estimated that the Rock Island could be rebuilt and re-equipped at a cost of $100 million and sought financing for the plan. Grain shuttles that had no cabooses at the end of their trains became a cost-effective way to gain market share and help finance the plan internally.

Nevertheless, new and rebuilt locomotives arrived on the property in gleaming powder blue and white to replace some of the tired, filthy power. Track rebuild projects covered the system. Main lines that had seen little or no maintenance in years were pulled from the mud. Rail and tie replacement programs attacked the maintenance backlog. This coincided with a massive campaign beginning in May 1975 to rebrand the railroad as simply “The Rock”, with modern eye-catching livery. However, the FRA-backed loans that Ingram sought were thwarted by the lobbying efforts of competing railroads, which saw a healthy Rock Island as a threat to their own survival. By 1978, main line track improved in quality. For example, at the end of that summer, the Illinois Division had no slow orders, and freight velocity was rising. The sale of the Golden State Route to the Southern Pacific had been agreed to. The Rock Island slowly inched towards a financial break-even point, despite the economic malaise that plagued the late 1970s.

Creditors, such as Henry Crown, advocated for the shutdown and liquidation of the property. Crown declared that the Rock Island was not capable of operating profitably, much less paying its outstanding debts. At the same time, Crown invested as much as he could in Rock Island bonds and other debt at bankruptcy-induced junk status prices.

For the previous two years, while the Rock Island invested heavily into its physical plant, the Rock Island brotherhoods had been working under labor agreements that were no longer valid. The front line operating employees had not had an increase in pay since the existing contracts expired yet remained on the job during extensive contract negotiations. By the summer of 1979, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the United Transportation Union had accepted new agreements. The Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks (BRAC) held firm to their demand that pay increases be back dated to the expiration date of the previous agreement.

The Rock Island offered to open the books to show the precarious financial condition of the road in an effort to get the BRAC in line with the other unions that had already signed agreements. Fred J. Kroll, president of the BRAC, declined the offer to audit the books of the Rock Island. Kroll pulled his BRAC clerks off the job in August, 1979. Picket lines went up at every terminal on the Rock Island&#x27;s system and the operating brotherhoods honored the picket lines. The Rock Island ground to a halt.

The Ingram management team operated as much of the Rock Island as they could. Trains slowly began to move, with more traffic being hauled every week of the strike. President Jimmy Carter issued a back-to-work order that BRAC dismissed. Still more traffic flowed on the strikebound Rock Island. According to Ingram, &quot;by the end of the sixth week, the Rock Island was handling about 30 percent of its prestrike tonnage with 5 percent of the prestrike onboard train operating personnel. Projections indicated that by the end of November, the company would be handling about half of its prestrike tonnage and earning a profit of about $5 million per month. In other words, the company was winning the strike.&quot; Seeing the trains rolling despite the strike and fearing a Florida East Coast strikebreaking situation, the unions appealed to the FRA and ICC for relief. Despite the fact that Rock Island management had been able to move 80% of pre-strike tonnage, at the behest of the Carter Administration, the ICC declared a transportation emergency, finding that the Rock Island would not be able to move the 1979 grain harvest to market. This decision came despite the railroad&#x27;s movement of more grain out of Iowa in the week immediately preceding the order than during any week in its history. The ICC issued a Directed Service Order authorizing the Kansas City Terminal Railway to take over operations.

The Directed Service Order enabled one-time suitors, via KCT management, to basically test operate portions of the Rock Island that had once interested them. On January 24, 1980, Judge McGarr elected to not review the Rock Island&#x27;s final plan of reorganization. He simply initiated the shutdown and liquidation of the Rock Island, which was what Henry Crown had advocated for from the very beginning. Not wanting to preside over an asset sale, Rock Island president John W. Ingram resigned, and Gibbons took over as president of the bankrupt railroad.

Kansas City Terminal began the process of embargoing in-bound shipments in late February, and the final train battled three days of snow drifts to arrive in Denver on March 31, 1980. Cars and locomotives were gathered in &#x27;ghost trains&#x27; that appeared on otherwise defunct Rock Island lines and accumulated at major terminals and shops and prepared for sale.

==Legacy==
The railroad&#x27;s locomotives, rail cars, equipment, tracks, and real estate were sold to other railroads or to scrappers. Gibbons was able to raise more than $500 million in the liquidation, paying off all the railroad&#x27;s creditors, bondholders and all other debts in full at face value with interest. Henry Crown was ultimately proven correct, as both he and other bondholders who had purchased Rock Island debt for cents on the dollar during the low ebb in prices did especially well. The line from the end of commuter service in Blue Island to Bureau Junction was leased to the Chessie System. The Chicago and North Western acquired the line between the Twin Cities and Kansas City. The line between Tucumcari and St. Louis was acquired by the Cotton Belt. The Choctaw Route was sold in pieces. The line between Herington, Kansas and Fort Worth, Texas was sold to the Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad. The line between Peoria, Illinois, Bureau Junction and Omaha, Nebraska was acquired by the Iowa Interstate Railroad.

Gibbons was released from the Rock Island on June 1, 1984, after its estate expired. With all assets sold and all debt retired, the Rock Island found itself with a large infusion of cash. The name of the company was changed to Chicago Pacific Corporation to further distance itself from the defunct railroad. Its first purchase was vacuum maker Hoover Company. In 1988, the company was acquired by the Maytag Corporation.

Ironically, through the megamergers of the 1990s, the Union Pacific ultimately ended up owning and operating more of the Rock Island than it would have acquired in its attempted 1964 merger. The one line it currently does not own (or operate regularly, other than detours) is the Chicago-to-Omaha main line that drove it to merge with the Rock Island in the first place. This line now prospers under the Iowa Interstate Railroad.

The company inspired the song &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;, first written in 1934 and recorded by numerous artists.

A spur of the Rock Island Railroad that ran beside a small hotel in Eldon, Missouri, owned by the grandmother of Mrs. Paul (Ruth) Henning also inspired the popular television show &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; in the early 1960s. Ruth Henning is listed as a co-creator of the show, along with her husband Paul, who also created &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and executive produced Jay Sommers&#x27;s &quot;Green Acres&quot;.

The Rock Island Line Workshop, located in Silvis, Illinois, is now home to the Railroading Heritage of Midwest America (RRHMA), a non-profit railroad preservation organization. Built in 1903, this was the railroad&#x27;s largest workshop, sitting on a 900-acre site between the railroad&#x27;s main line and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad’s Rock Island branch. After the closing in 1980, the workshop was sold to National Railway Equipment, and it remained a maintenance and refurbishment hub for the wider North American railroad industry. NRE sold the facility to the RRHMA in late 2021, and plans call for the refurbishment of the facility to maintain steam, heritage diesel and associated rolling stock, in addition to developing a museum on the site.

=== Reestablishment ===

In 2017, thirty-seven years after the Rock Island folded, a new startup company that owns the rights to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific name began operating in the southern United States. The new Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad LLC is primarily a shortline holding company, while also providing numerous other railroad services, such as switching, railroad management, railcar fleet management, railcar storage, and locomotive maintenance. The company acquired their first railroad in early 2019 with the acquisition of the Mississippi Delta Railroad. The company rosters eight locomotives.

<doc id="409665" wikidata="Q663839" url="?curid=409665" title="Clipper chip">
<text>The Clipper chip was a chipset that was developed and promoted by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as an encryption device that secured &quot;voice and data messages&quot; with a built-in backdoor that was intended to &quot;allow Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials the ability to decode intercepted voice and data transmissions.&quot; It was intended to be adopted by telecommunications companies for voice transmission. Introduced in 1993, it was entirely defunct by 1996.
== Key escrow ==
The Clipper chip used a data encryption algorithm called Skipjack to transmit information and the Diffie–Hellman key exchange-algorithm to distribute the public keys between peers. Skipjack was invented by the National Security Agency of the U.S. Government; this algorithm was initially classified SECRET, which prevented it from being subjected to peer review from the encryption research community. The government did state that it used an 80-bit key, that the algorithm was symmetric, and that it was similar to the DES algorithm. The Skipjack algorithm was declassified and published by the NSA on June 24, 1998. The initial cost of the chips was said to be $16 (unprogrammed) or $26 (programmed), with its logic designed by Mykotronx, and fabricated by VLSI Technology, Inc.

At the heart of the concept was key escrow. In the factory, any new telephone or other device with a Clipper chip would be given a cryptographic key, that would then be provided to the government in escrow. If government agencies &quot;established their authority&quot; to listen to a communication, then the key would be given to those government agencies, who could then decrypt all data transmitted by that particular telephone. The newly formed Electronic Frontier Foundation preferred the term &quot;key surrender&quot; to emphasize what they alleged was really occurring.

== Clinton Administration ==
The Clinton Administration argued that the Clipper chip was essential for law enforcement to keep up with the constantly progressing technology in the United States. While many believed that the device would act as an additional way for terrorists to receive information, the Clinton Administration said it would actually increase national security. They argued that because &quot;terrorists would have to use it to communicate with outsiders — banks, suppliers, and contacts — the Government could listen in on those calls.&quot;

== Other proponents ==
There were several advocates of the Clipper chip who argued that the technology was safe to implement and effective for its intended purpose of providing law enforcement with the ability to intercept communications when necessary and with a warrant to do so. Howard S. Dakoff, writing in the &quot;John Marshall Law Review&quot;, stated that the technology was secure and the legal rationale for its implementation was sound. Stewart Baker wrote an opinion piece in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine debunking a series of what he purported to be myths surrounding the technology.

== Backlash ==
Organizations such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation challenged the Clipper chip proposal, saying that it would have the effect not only of subjecting citizens to increased and possibly illegal government surveillance, but that the strength of the Clipper chip&#x27;s encryption could not be evaluated by the public as its design was classified secret, and that therefore individuals and businesses might be hobbled with an insecure communications system. Further, it was pointed out that while American companies could be forced to use the Clipper chip in their encryption products, foreign companies could not, and presumably phones with strong data encryption would be manufactured abroad and spread throughout the world and into the United States, negating the point of the whole exercise, and, of course, materially damaging U.S. manufacturers en route. Senators John Ashcroft and John Kerry were opponents of the Clipper chip proposal, arguing in favor of the individual&#x27;s right to encrypt messages and export encryption software.

The release and development of several strong cryptographic software packages such as Nautilus, PGP and PGPfone was in response to the government push for the Clipper chip. The thinking was that if strong cryptography was freely available on the Internet as an alternative, the government would be unable to stop its use.

== Technical vulnerabilities ==
In 1994, Matt Blaze published the paper &quot;Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard&quot;. It pointed out that the Clipper&#x27;s escrow system had a serious vulnerability: the chip transmitted a 128-bit &quot;Law Enforcement Access Field&quot; (LEAF) that contained the information necessary to recover the encryption key. To prevent the software that transmitted the message from tampering with the LEAF, a 16-bit hash was included. The Clipper chip would not decode messages with an invalid hash; however, the 16-bit hash was too short to provide meaningful security. A brute-force attack would quickly produce another LEAF value that would give the same hash but not yield the correct keys after the escrow attempt. This would allow the Clipper chip to be used as an encryption device, while disabling the key escrow capability. In 1995 Yair Frankel and Moti Yung published another attack which is inherent to the design and which shows that the key escrow device tracking and authenticating capability (namely, the LEAF) of one device, can be attached to messages coming from another device and will nevertheless be received, thus bypassing the escrow in real time. In 1997, a group of leading cryptographers published a paper, &quot;The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption&quot;, analyzing the architectural vulnerabilities of implementing key escrow systems in general, including but not limited to the Clipper chip Skipjack protocol.

== Lack of adoption ==
The Clipper chip was not embraced by consumers or manufacturers and the chip itself was no longer relevant by 1996; the only significant purchaser of phones with the chip was the United States Department of Justice. The U.S. government continued to press for key escrow by offering incentives to manufacturers, allowing more relaxed export controls if key escrow were part of cryptographic software that was exported. These attempts were largely made moot by the widespread use of strong cryptographic technologies, such as PGP, which were not under the control of the U.S. government.

, strongly encrypted voice channels are still not the predominant mode for current cell phone communications. Secure cell phone devices and smartphone apps exist, but may require specialized hardware, and typically require that both ends of the connection employ the same encryption mechanism. Such apps usually communicate over secure Internet pathways (e.g. ZRTP) instead of through phone voice data networks.

== Later debates ==
Following the Snowden disclosures from 2013, Apple and Google stated that they would lock down all data stored on their smartphones with encryption, in such a way that Apple and Google themselves could not break the encryption even if ordered to do so with a warrant. This prompted a strong reaction from the authorities, including the chief of detectives for the Chicago Police Department stating that &quot;Apple[&#x27;s iPhone] will become the phone of choice for the pedophile&quot;. An editorial in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; argued that &quot;smartphone users must accept that they cannot be above the law if there is a valid search warrant&quot;, and after claiming to agree that backdoors would be undesirable, then suggested implementing a &quot;golden key&quot; backdoor which would unlock the data with a warrant. The members of &quot;The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, and Trusted Third-Party Encryption&quot; 1997 paper, as well as other researchers at MIT, wrote a follow-up article in response to the revival of this debate, arguing that mandated government access to private conversations would be an even worse problem than it would have been twenty years before.

<doc id="409666" wikidata="Q92858" url="?curid=409666" title="Daniel Lewin">
<text>Daniel Mark Lewin (; May 14, 1970 – September 11, 2001) was an American and Israeli mathematician and entrepreneur who co-founded Akamai Technologies. A passenger on board American Airlines Flight 11, it is believed that Lewin was stabbed to death by Satam al-Suqami, one of the hijackers of that flight, and was the first victim of the September 11 attacks.

==Early life==
Lewin was born May 14, 1970, in Denver, Colorado, and moved to Israel with his parents at age 14, where he remained for the rest of his childhood.

==Career==
Lewin served for four years in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as an officer in Sayeret Matkal, one of the IDF&#x27;s special forces units. Lewin earned the rank of captain.

He attended the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa while simultaneously working at IBM&#x27;s research laboratory in the city. While at IBM, he was responsible for developing the Genesys system, a processor verification tool that is used widely within IBM and in other companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and SGS-Thomson.

Upon receiving a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in 1995, he traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to begin graduate studies toward a Ph.D at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1996. While there, he and his advisor, Professor F. Thomson Leighton, came up with consistent hashing, an innovative algorithm for optimizing Internet traffic. These algorithms became the basis for Akamai Technologies, which the two founded in 1998. Lewin was the company&#x27;s chief technology officer and a board member, and achieved great wealth during the height of the Internet boom.

==Death and legacy==

Lewin was reportedly stabbed aboard American Airlines Flight 11 as it was hijacked during the September 11 attacks. He was traveling that day for a business meeting in Los Angeles. A 2001 FAA memo suggests he may have been stabbed by Satam al-Suqami after attempting to foil the hijacking. According to the memo, Lewin was seated in business class in seat 9B, close to hijackers Mohamed Atta, Abdulaziz al-Omari and al-Suqami. It was first reported that he had been shot by al-Suqami, although the final draft of the memo dropped all references to gunfire.

According to the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, Lewin was stabbed by one of the hijackers, probably Satam al-Suqami, who was seated directly behind him.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11Report&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Flight attendants on the plane who contacted airline officials from the plane reported that Lewin&#x27;s throat was slashed, probably by the terrorist sitting behind him.

The 9/11 Commission speculated that Lewin, who had served four years in the Israeli military, may have attempted to confront Atta or Omari, who had been seated in front of him, not knowing that al-Suqami was sitting just behind him. Lewin was identified as the first victim of the September 11 attacks.

Lewin, who was 31, was survived by his wife Anne and his two sons, Eitan and Itamar, who were aged five and eight at the time of the September 2001 attacks.

In July 2004, it was reported that Lewin&#x27;s recovered remains had been identified.

After his death, the intersection of Main and Vassar Streets in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was renamed Danny Lewin Square in his honor. The award given to the best student-written paper at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) was also named the Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award, in his honor. In 2011, on the tenth anniversary of his death, Lewin&#x27;s contributions to the internet were memorialized by friends and colleagues.

At the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum, Lewin is memorialized at the North Pool, on Panel N-75.

Lewin is the subject of the 2013 biography &quot;No Better Time: The Brief, Remarkable Life of Danny Lewin, the Genius Who Transformed the Internet&quot; by Molly Knight Raskin. According to Raskin, &quot;Because of Akamai, almost every major news site remained up and running [on September 11], a feat that proved everything Danny promised to be possible&quot;.

<text>Michael Herman Michaud ( ; born January 18, 1955) is an American businessman and politician from Maine. Michaud served as the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2015. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The primarily rural district comprises nearly 80% of the state by area and includes the cities of Lewiston, Auburn, Bangor, Presque Isle, and Ellsworth. It is the largest Congressional district by area east of the Mississippi River.

Michaud was previously President of the Maine Senate. He was employed for over two decades at the Great Northern Paper Company and remains a member of the United Steelworkers. He was one of the few members of Congress during his tenure who did not attend college. He did, however, attend the John F. Kennedy School of Government Program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government at Harvard University. He has also been awarded honorary Doctor of Public Service degrees from Maine&#x27;s Unity College, Husson College, and Maine Maritime Academy.

Michaud, who speaks a little French, is the first openly Franco-American to be elected to a U.S. federal office from Maine. He was elected as a co-chair of the congressional French Caucus in January 2011. He came out as gay in 2013, becoming one of the few openly LGBT members of Congress and the first to reside in Maine.

Michaud was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Maine in the 2014 election. While initially considered a favorite by some analysts on account of the general unpopularity of incumbent Paul LePage, he lost by a margin larger than expected. He currently holds a seat on the East Millinocket Board of Selectmen.

==Early life==
Michaud was born in Millinocket, Maine, the son of Geneva Jean (née Morrow) and James Michaud, Sr. His parents were both of French-Canadian descent. He grew up in Medway, Maine, and is a graduate of Schenck High School in East Millinocket.

== Early career ==
He was a mill worker and supervisor at Great Northern Paper Company in East Millinocket, from 1973 until his election to Congress in 2002, during which time he was a member of the United Steelworkers. Michaud&#x27;s interest in politics began when he campaigned to clean up the Penobscot River in the late 1970s.

===Maine House of Representatives (1980–1994)===

====Elections====
Michaud was elected to the Maine House of Representatives in 1980 to the 134th district. In 1984, he defeated an independent candidate by a landslide, despite large Republican gains in other districts. He also won re-election in 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1992.

====Tenure====
Michaud served eleven terms in the Maine Legislature, including seven in the Maine House of Representatives and four in the Maine Senate. In the House, Michaud represented Medway and East Millinocket.

As Chair of the Energy Committee, he helped to increase the cost of dumping.

====Committee assignments====
* Energy and Natural Resources Committee (Chair)

===Maine Senate (1994–2003)===

====Elections====
In 1994, he ran for Maine&#x27;s 3rd Senate district. Despite the fact that it was a typical backlash year with one party taking the lead, he defeated incumbent State Senator Margaret Ludwig, a millionaire, 58%-42%. In 1996, he won re-election to a second term with 64% of the vote. In 1998, he won re-election to a third term with 77% of the vote. In 2000, he won re-election to a fourth term with 69% of the vote.

====Tenure====
During his years in the state legislature, he continued to work at the Great Northern Paper Company until his election to Congress. To accommodate his legislative schedule, he changed his factory shifts, for instance by working weekends.

From 1994 to 1996, Michaud was appointed to Governor Angus King&#x27;s Productivity Realization Task Force. In 1997, he was appointed to the Maine Commission on Children&#x27;s Health Care. After the 1998 election, the Maine Senate found itself divided into 17 Republicans, 17 Democrats and one Independent. In a compromise organization, each party agreed to assume the Senate Presidency for one year, with the single Independent awarded the chair of the crucial Appropriations Committee. Accordingly, in December 2000, Michaud was unanimously elected President of the Maine Senate.

In 2001, Mike was honored with the dedication of the Michael H. Michaud Technology Center for helping to secure state funding for the University of Maine at Presque Isle Houlton Higher Education Center. He also received the College Board&#x27;s Education Award at the National Council of State Legislatures annual meeting.

====Committee assignments====
* Joint Appropriations Committee (Chair)

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

;2002
Michaud ran for Congress in 2002 for Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district after incumbent Democrat John Baldacci decided to run for Governor of Maine. Michaud faced three other state senators in the Democratic primary. He won the primary with a plurality of 31% of the vote, beating the second place challenger, Susan W. Longley, by 4 percentage points. The general election garnered considerable publicity because Michaud was anti-abortion, while the Republican was pro-abortion rights. Republican Kevin Raye, of Perry, was the Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe. Michaud defeated Raye, 52%–48%.

;2004
Michaud won re-election to a second term, defeating Republican businessman Brian Hamel, 58%–39%.

;2006

Michaud won re-election to a third term, defeating Republican Lisbon Town Selectman Laurence Scott D&#x27;Amboise, 71%–29%.

;2008

Michaud won re-election to a fourth term, defeating his Republican opponent, professor John Frary 67%-33%.

;2010

Michaud won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Republican business owner and U.S. Army veteran Jason Levesque, 55%–45%. He won every county in the district, except Piscataquis.

;2012

Michaud won re-election to a sixth term, defeating Republican State Senator and Maine Senate President Kevin Raye (who had run ten years earlier), 58%–42%. He won every county except Washington, the location of Raye&#x27;s hometown of Perry.

===Tenure===
Michaud was the only freshman Democratic member of Congress to vote for the 2003 ban on intact dilation and extraction (IDX), often called partial-birth abortion. However, Michaud&#x27;s stance on abortion and related reproductive issues has changed since he entered office. When he was elected in 2003, he received a 10% rating by the NARAL Pro Choice America, a reflection of anti-abortion votes; between 2010 and 2013, the same organization gave Michaud a 100% rating. This change is likely in part because of the votes Michaud made in favor of allowing and expanding stem cell research, and his vote against banning abortion from federal health care coverage.

Mike Michaud has been an advocate for veterans for as long as he has served in Congress. As Chairman of the Health Subcommittee of the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee, Michaud has advocated for more extensive healthcare benefits for veterans and also for more inclusive rural healthcare for veterans. In 2007 Michaud came close to being elected Chairman of the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee. He has also called for lowering the cost of prescription drugs. In addition, Michaud has worked to pass legislation providing scholarships for returning soldiers, and decreasing the rate of homelessness among veterans. Recently, Michaud became an original cosponsor of &quot;Hiring our Veterans Act&quot; which gives tax credits to employers who hire veterans. Michaud has worked with the US Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) on many projects. These include a scholarship foundation for children of soldiers killed in active duty, an expansion of VA care in rural Maine, and a major increase in VA funding.

On May 29, 2014, Michaud called for the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki in response to problems in the Veterans Health Administration regarding long wait times and coverups of poor performance. He had faced criticism on this issue from his opponents in the Governor&#x27;s race.

In addition to veterans&#x27; health, Michaud has been supporting healthcare on a larger scale. He has voted in favor of increased health coverage for children, and voted against cuts to Medicare. In 2010, he received a 100% rating from the American Public Health Association, along with favorable ratings from other healthcare groups. Michaud joined a group of 44 congressmen in November 2011 to express the importance of men&#x27;s being screened for prostate cancer. This bipartisan group was formed after the United States Preventive Task Force recommended that healthy men should not have such a screening.

Michaud is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives. He was the only Congressperson from New England in the coalition. On October 19, 2007, he endorsed former Senator John Edwards for president.

Michaud has a strong record of voting in support of environmental issues. Michaud voted no on opening Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling, on barring the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, on scheduling permitting for new oil refineries, on authorizing construction of new oil refineries, on passage of the Bush Administration national energy policy, and on implementing Bush-Cheney national energy policy. Michaud voted yes on enforcing limits on global warming pollution by requiring utilities to supply an increasing percentage of their demand from a combination of energy efficiency savings and renewable energy, on tax credits for renewable electricity with PAYGO offsets, on tax incentives for energy production and conservation, on tax incentives for renewable energy, on investing in homegrown biofuel, on criminalizing oil cartels like OPEC, on removing oil and gas exploration subsidies, and on keeping moratorium on offshore oil drilling. Furthermore, Michaud co-sponsored a bill in 2005 to establish greenhouse gas tradeable allowances; the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works but, however, it never came to vote. He also co-sponsored a bill in 2008 to allow states to define stricter greenhouse gas emission standards than those specified by the federal Clean Air Act. In keeping with his voting record, Michaud adopted a Blue Dog Coalition press release to balance fossil fuels and viable renewable energy. Campaign for America&#x27;s Future (CAF) has given Michaud a score of 100% on energy issues.

Michaud was briefly mentioned in Maine native author Stephen King&#x27;s work, &quot;11/22/63&quot;.

==2014 gubernatorial campaign==

On June 13, 2013, Michaud announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to enter the 2014 race for Governor of Maine. His campaign announced on August 14 that he would officially enter the race the next day.

Michaud won the Democratic primary unopposed. He lost the general election to incumbent Republican Paul LePage by a larger than expected margin, in part due to the unknown popularity of LePage, an alleged massive Republican wave that took place nationwide, and a third-party candidate splitting votes.

He was succeeded in Congress by Republican Bruce Poliquin in January 2015.

==Post-election activities==
The United States Department of Labor announced on July 30, 2015, that President Barack Obama nominated Michaud to a department position dealing with training and employment of veterans.

Michaud served as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans&#x27; Employment and Training from December 2, 2015, to January 20, 2017. As the head of the Veterans&#x27; Employment and Training Service (VETS), Michaud reported to Secretary of Labor Tom Perez. VETS serves as the focal point in the federal government for veterans&#x27; employment by preparing military service members for transition to civilian employment, providing veterans with services to assist them in getting good jobs, protecting veterans&#x27; employment rights, and promoting veterans&#x27; employment in the private sector.

In 2018, he was elected to the Board of Selectmen in East Millinocket, his hometown.

On March 28, 2019, Michaud was nominated by Gov. Janet Mills to serve as a trustee on both the board of the University of Maine System and the Maine Community College System.

Michaud endorsed Michael Bloomberg as a nominee for President of the United States in the 2020 Maine Democratic primary.

==Personal life==
Michaud came out as gay in an editorial released to the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot;, &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot;, and the Associated Press on November 4, 2013; however he stated that he has never had a romantic partner. He is the first openly LGBT congressman to serve the state of Maine; he was one of seven then-current members of the United States House of Representatives to be openly LGBT, and one of eight in either house of Congress. If he had been elected Governor, he would have become the first openly gay Governor in the United States at the time of his election (Gov. Jim McGreevey of New Jersey came out after he had taken office). 
Michaud served as a Grand Marshal for the 2014 Portland Pride Parade on June 21.

<text>Joseph Natalio Baca Sr. (born January 23, 1947) is an American Democratic politician who served as the U.S. representative for southwestern San Bernardino County (including Fontana, Rialto, Ontario and parts of the city of San Bernardino) from 1999 to 2013.

In June 2015, Baca switched his affiliation to the Republican Party, citing his &quot;core Christian&quot; and pro-business beliefs. In January 2018, Baca switched his affiliation back to the Democratic Party, saying that &quot;in my heart, I&#x27;ve always been a Democrat with a 100 percent voting record for labor.&quot;

Prior to his time in the House of Representatives, Baca served in the California Senate from 1998 to 1999, and the California State Assembly from 1992 to 1998.

He currently serves on the Rialto City Council.

==Early life, education and career==
Baca was born in Belen, New Mexico in 1947, the youngest of 15 children in a primarily Spanish-speaking household. His father was a railroad laborer. The family moved to Barstow, California when Joe was young, where he shined shoes at age 10, delivered newspapers, and later worked as a laborer for the Santa Fe Railroad, until he was drafted in 1966, serving in the United States Army until 1968. He did not serve in Vietnam.

Following military service, Baca attended Barstow Community College and went on to receive his bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from California State University, Los Angeles. He worked for 15 years in community relations with General Telephone and Electric. In 1979, he was the first Latino elected to the board of trustees for the San Bernardino Valley College District. He was elected to the State Assembly in 1992, and to the State Senate in 1998.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Agriculture
**Subcommittee on Department Operations, Oversight, and Credit
**Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry
**Subcommittee on Nutrition and Horticulture (Ranking Member)
*Committee on Financial Services
**Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
**Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations

===Caucus membership===
*Congressional Hispanic Caucus (Former Chairman)
**Corporate America, Technology, Communications and the Arts Task Force (Chairman)
*Blue Dog Coalition

He served on the House Financial Services Committee, where he was a member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises, and the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit. Rep. Baca also served on the House Agriculture Committee, where he was the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Departmental Operations, Oversight, Nutrition and Forestry.

Rep. Baca was the Chair of the CHC Corporate America Task Force, which aims to increase Hispanic representation in corporate America. He created and co-chaired the Congressional Sex and Violence in the Media Caucus. Other caucus memberships included the Congressional Diabetes Caucus, the Military/ Veterans Caucus, the Native American Caucus and the U.S.-Mexico Caucus.

In 2011, Rep. Baca became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act. The same year, he voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.

In March 2012, Baca and Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) introduced a bill that would force video game companies to put warning labels on their products. H.R. 4204, the Violence in Video Games Labeling Act, would compel game companies to label their products with &quot;WARNING: Exposure to violent video games has been linked to aggressive behavior&quot;. 

==Political campaigns==

=== 1999 special election ===
A few months after Baca was elected to the State Senate, Congressman George Brown, Jr. died after a long illness. Baca finished first in a seven-way primary, but fell far short of a majority due to the presence of two minor Democratic candidates. In the special general election, Baca defeated Republican Elia Pirozzi with 50.4%.

Baca won a full term in 2000 with 59% of the vote. After the 2000 census, the district was renumbered as the 43rd and reconfigured as a majority-Hispanic district. Baca was handily reelected from this redrawn district in 2002, and did not face another close contest until 2012.

=== 2012 campaign ===
After the 2010 United States Census, the Citizens Redistricting Commission significantly redrew California&#x27;s congressional map. The bulk of Baca&#x27;s former territory became the 35th District, though his home in Rialto was placed in the 31st District. Baca opted to run in the 35th, and finished first in the new all-party primary with 46.7 percent of the vote. His nearest opponent, State Senator Gloria Negrete McLeod, took 34 percent; under the new &quot;top two&quot; primary rules, both advanced to the general election.

A few weeks before the general election, Negrete McLeod&#x27;s campaign benefited from $3.2 million in independent expenditures from the Federal Super PAC of billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who was Mayor of New York City at that time. The Super PAC ran negative advertisements in newspapers, radio, and television accusing Baca of being soft on crime and causing perchlorate water contamination in drinking water. Bloomberg had become unhappy with Baca because he had not been supportive of Bloomberg&#x27;s efforts for stronger federal laws for gun control and the enactment of federal registration. Negrete McLeod defeated Baca, taking 56 percent to Baca&#x27;s 44 percent. 

Baca ran for Congress again, changing to the 31st District in 2014, but finished fifth in the primary with 11.2%.

In 2014, Baca also ran for Mayor of Fontana. He lost in a landslide and subsequently announced his retirement from politics. but made a comeback to the Rialto City Council in 2022.

=== 2022 campaign ===
In 2022, Baca made a political comeback after an eight-year retirement, as he was elected to a seat on the Rialto City Council. 
=== 2024 campaign ===
Baca won the 2024 Rialto mayoral election, defeating incumbent Deborah Robertson and two other candidates. Baca secured 6,226 votes (40.76%) to Robertson&#x27;s 4,668 votes (30.56%). The other candidates, Rafael Trujillo and Ché Rose Wright, finished with 22.55% and 6.13%, respectively.

==Controversies==
According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Baca, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, directed Caucus funds from its PAC BOLDPAC (Building Our Leadership Diversity) to the unsuccessful California campaigns of his sons, Joe Baca, Jr. and Jeremy Baca. At the time, Rep. Loretta Sanchez and five other members dropped out of the PAC in protest of these actions. They alleged that the funds, meant to elect Hispanic candidates, should not have been used to help Baca&#x27;s sons run against Hispanic candidates and that in a previous race funded by the PAC, Joe Jr. had run against Hispanic candidates.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released a report stating that Rep. Baca had paid his daughter $27,000 from campaign funds and donated more than $20,000 to his sons&#x27; political campaigns from his own campaign funds. They reported accusations that were made in 2006 by former members of Baca&#x27;s Washington staff that they were sent to California in 2004 for a staff retreat and pressured to work on Joe Baca, Jr.&#x27;s campaign for the state Assembly on their paid time for the senior Baca.

=== 2007 House Hispanic Caucus election ===
In January 2007, fellow Hispanic Caucus members including Loretta Sanchez, Nydia Velázquez, Hilda Solis, and Linda Sánchez wrote a letter to Baca asking for a new election with a secret ballot. They claimed that Baca was elected chair of the Caucus in a public ballot, despite Caucus rules for electing a chair that require a secret-ballot election.

On January 31, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Rep. Baca had called Loretta Sanchez a &quot;whore&quot;. Baca denied making the insult. Loretta Sanchez and Solis alleged that Baca made the remark in the summer of 2006.

Citing Baca&#x27;s alleged insult and the perceived impropriety in Baca&#x27;s election to chairman of the CHC, as well as Baca&#x27;s treatment of Latina members in the CHC, Loretta Sanchez resigned from the Caucus along with her sister, three other female California members and one female member from Arizona. The two congresswomen state that they heard the remark from unnamed sources, although &quot;Politico&quot; identified California State Assemblyman Fabian Núñez as one of those who heard the insult firsthand and told Loretta Sanchez. She said that Baca confirmed the comments to her sister Linda Sánchez the day before Loretta Sanchez confronted him over the accusation.

In a February, 2014 interview in &quot;The Hill&quot;, Baca described Representative Gloria Negrete McLeod, who had defeated him in the 2012 elections after receiving $3.2 million in help from then New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s Super PAC in the final weeks leading up to the election, as &quot;some bimbo.&quot; Minutes later he apologized, saying he was upset because he felt it was a disservice to the voters that she had announced the day before that she would not seek re-election to the congressional seat after holding it for only two years.

==Personal life==
Baca and his wife, Barbara, began their own business, Interstate World Travel, in San Bernardino in 1989. They have four children: Joe Jr., Jeremy, Natalie and Jennifer. Son Joe Baca, Jr. served one term as state assemblyman for California&#x27;s 62nd district.

<doc id="409677" wikidata="Q6061413" url="?curid=409677" title="Involuntary servitude">
<text>Involuntary servitude or involuntary slavery is a legal and constitutional term for a person labouring against that person&#x27;s will to benefit another, under some form of coercion, to which it may constitute slavery. While labouring to benefit another occurs also in the condition of slavery, involuntary servitude does not necessarily connote the complete lack of freedom experienced in chattel slavery; involuntary servitude may also refer to other forms of unfree labour. Involuntary servitude is not dependent upon compensation or its amount. Prison labour is often referred to as involuntary servitude. Prisoners are forced to work for free or for very little money while they carry out their time in the system.

==Jurisdictions==
===Malaysia===
The Constitution of Malaysia, Part II, article 6, states:
# No person shall be held in slavery.
#All forms of forced labour are prohibited, but Parliament may by law provide for compulsory service for national purposes.
#Work incidental to the serving of a sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of law shall not be taken to be forced labour within the meaning of this Article.
#Where by any written law the whole or any part of the functions of any public authority is to be carried on by another public authority, for the purpose of enabling those functions to be performed the employees of the first mentioned public authority shall be bound to serve the second mentioned public authority shall not be taken to be forced labour within the meaning of this Article, and no such employee shall be entitled to demand any right from either the first mentioned or the second mentioned public authority by reason of the transfer of his employment.

===Philippines===
The Constitution of the Philippines, article III, section 18, states that &quot;No involuntary servitude in any form shall exist except as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.&quot;

===United States===

The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution makes involuntary servitude illegal under any U.S. jurisdiction whether at the hands of the government or in the private sphere, except as punishment for a crime: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court has held, in &quot;Butler v. Perry&quot; (1916), that the Thirteenth Amendment does not prohibit &quot;enforcement of those duties which individuals owe to the state, such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc.&quot; Onerous long term alimony and spousal support orders, premised on a proprietary interest retained by former marital partners in one another&#x27;s persons, have also been allowed in many states, though they may in practice embody features of involuntary servitude.

==Other interpretations of involuntary servitude==
=== Abortion rights ===
Some have also argued that, should &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), be overturned by the United States Supreme Court, a constitutional right to abortion could still be sustained on the basis that denying it would subject women to involuntary servitude contrary to the Thirteenth Amendment. That decision was overturned in June of 2022, but it is unclear whether forced pregnancy and child-bearing are within the scope of the term &quot;servitude&quot;.

===Compulsory schooling===
Some libertarians consider compulsory schooling involuntary servitude. John Taylor Gatto, a retired schoolteacher and libertarian activist critical of compulsory schooling writes of what he terms &quot;The Cult Of Forced Schooling&quot;. Many libertarians consider income taxation a form of involuntary servitude. Republican Congressman Ron Paul has described income tax as &quot;a form of involuntary servitude&quot;, and has written, &quot;... things like Selective Service and the income tax make me wonder how serious we really are in defending just basic freedoms.

===Military conscription===
The Libertarian Party of the United States and other libertarians consider military conscription to be involuntary servitude in the sense of the Thirteenth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed with that interpretation in &quot;Arver v. United States,&quot; relying on text of Article I and the prerequisites of sovereignty.

==Law and economics==

In contract theory, researchers have studied whether workers should be allowed to waive their right to quit work, or whether the right to quit should be inalienable. Suppose that at date 1 a worker &quot;voluntarily&quot; signs a labour contract according to which the worker has to perform a task at date 2. At date 2, the worker no longer wants to perform the task (see the English contract law case Lumley v Wagner for a classic example). Would it be a form of &quot;involuntary&quot; servitude if the worker were forced by the courts to fulfill the contractual duties? Müller and Schmitz (2021) have shown that from an economic efficiency point-of-view, in a static setting it can indeed be desirable to restrict the freedom of contract by making the right to quit inalienable. However, they also show that in a dynamic setting even the worker can be strictly better off when it is possible to contractually waive the right to quit.

<doc id="409679" wikidata="Q538978" url="?curid=409679" title="Ken Calvert">
<text>Kenneth Stanton Calvert (born June 8, 1953) is an American businessman and politician serving as the U.S. representative for , and previously the 44th, 42nd, and 43rd, serving since 1993. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is part of the Inland Empire of Southern California.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Calvert was born in Corona, California, to Marceline Hamblen and Ira D. Calvert Jr., and still lives in Corona. In 1970, he joined the congressional campaign of former state Assemblyman Victor Veysey. Calvert graduated from Corona High School in 1971. He worked in Veysey&#x27;s Washington, D.C., office as an intern after Veysey was re-elected in 1972. 

Calvert received an Associate of Arts degree from Chaffey Community College in 1973 and a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Diego State University in 1975. After college, he became a small business owner in the restaurant and real estate industries.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1982, the 29-year-old Calvert ran for the United States House of Representatives to represent a newly drawn district. He narrowly lost the Republican primary to Riverside County Supervisor Al McCandless, who was the choice of the Republican establishment. McCandless won the general election. From 1984 to 1988, Calvert chaired the Riverside County Republican Party.

Calvert was first elected to the House in a new district in 1992, while McCandless was reelected in a different district. Calvert won the general election with 47% of the vote, defeating Democrat Mark Takano by 519 votes. In 1994, he defeated Joe Khoury in the Republican primary, 51% to 49%. He was reelected in the 1994 general election with 55% of the vote, again defeating Takano.

In 1996, Calvert was reelected with 54% of the vote, defeating Democrat Guy Kimbrough. In 1998 he defeated Democrat Mike Rayburn with 55% of the vote. Calvert won again in 2000 with 74% of the vote, facing no major-party opposition.
Calvert was reelected in 2002, defeating college administrator Louis Vandenberg with 64% of the vote. He defeated Vandenberg again in 2004 with 61% of the vote, and in 2006 with 60% of the vote.

In 2008, Calvert defeated Democratic nominee Bill Hedrick by 25,582 to 15,952 votes. He declared victory immediately, but Hedrick waited three weeks before conceding, due to unusually high turnout prolonging the vote-counting process.

In 2010, Hedrick ran against Calvert again. While most pundits, such as Larry Sabato, expected him to lose again, sources such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked the race more competitive. &quot;The New York Times&quot; re-ranked this race from solid Republican to leaning Republican. Calvert won by ten percentage points.

The &quot;National Journal&quot;″s Cook Political Report named Calvert one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, largely due to his district&#x27;s rapidly growing Hispanic population. Despite this, Calvert defeated opponent Michael Williamson with 61% of the vote.

In 2022, Calvert sought reelection in California&#x27;s 41st congressional district due to redistricting. He defeated Democrat Will Rollins in the November 2022 general election.

In 2024, Calvert won a rematch against former prosecutor and 2022 Democratic candidate Will Rollins.

===Tenure===
====111th and 112th Congress====

On June 10, 2009, Calvert introduced H.R. 2788, the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial Act. This Act designates a national memorial at March Field Air Museum in honor of current and former members of the armed forces who have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Calvert worked to assemble a bipartisan group of 48 cosponsors for this legislation. On March 19, 2010, H.R. 2788 unanimously passed the House of Representatives. Calvert introduced H. Res. 377, a bill recognizing Armed Forces Day and the service of the members of the United States Armed Forces on April 29, 2009. This bill received 70 bipartisan cosponsorships and passed the House unanimously on May 14, 2009.

On March 25, 2010, Calvert introduced H. Res. 1219 to support the designation of a National Child Awareness Month to promote awareness of children&#x27;s charities and youth-serving organizations across the country. He assembled 40 bipartisan cosponsors for this bill and on July 19, 2010, the bill passed the House with unanimous support.

Calvert is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership.

In December 2017, Calvert voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, calling it &quot;the most pro-growth tax policy our country has seen in decades.&quot; He also said that it would provide &quot;lower taxes, more jobs, and higher wages.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Defense (Chair)
** Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies

===Caucus memberships===
* House Baltic Caucus
* Congressional Western Caucus
* Rare Disease Caucus
* United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus

==Political positions==
=== NASA ===
In the 109th Congress, Calvert chaired the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, which oversees NASA. As chair, he introduced and passed into law the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109–155), the first reauthorization bill of civilian space and aeronautics agency in five years. The reauthorization provided NASA with the direction and tools to implement President George W. Bush&#x27;s vision for space exploration while stressing the importance of NASA&#x27;s earth and space science and aeronautics work.

=== Abortion ===
Calvert supported the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, saying it &quot;shifts the power to set abortion policies to Congress and to the States&quot;.

=== LGBTQ+ rights ===
Calvert opposed gays serving in the military.

In 2009, he voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

On July 19, 2022, Calvert and 46 other Republican U.S. representatives voted for the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify the right to same-sex marriage in federal law.

=== Military ===
In September 2023, Calvert criticized far-right Republicans for stalling annual Pentagon funding legislation. Calvert said &quot;what&#x27;s happening is the military is being held hostage to these procedural votes, so that can&#x27;t happen.&quot;

=== Attempt to overturn 2020 election ===
In December 2020, Calvert signed onto the lawsuit seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case on December 11.

In January 2021, Calvert voted with six other Republican representatives from California to reject the certification of Arizona&#x27;s and Pennsylvania&#x27;s electoral votes. He questioned the results of the election, saying: &quot;during difficult and divisive times in our nation I believe we must follow the Constitution. That&#x27;s why today I lent my voice to the millions of Americans and my constituents who are deeply concerned by the integrity of the election ... I remain especially troubled by constitutionally questionable changes of voting rules in some states by authorities other than state legislatures.&quot;

=== Israel ===
Calvert voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

=== E-Verify ===
Calvert is the original author of the E-Verify law, the only employment verification program available to employers to check the work authorization status of newly hired employees. In 1995, he introduced H.R. 502, which was later included in the immigration reform bill, H.R. 2202. The immigration reforms were later wrapped into the FY1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The original program, known as the Basic Pilot Program, was only available to five states and employers used a call-in system. In the 12 years since its implementation, the Basic Pilot Program, now known as E-Verify, has expanded nationwide and is used by over 100,000 employers. Arizona and Mississippi have made use of E-Verify mandatory. In the 111th Congress Calvert again introduced legislation to make use of E-Verify mandatory.

=== CALFED ===
As Chairman of the Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power, Calvert introduced H.R. 2828, The Water Supply, Reliability, and Environmental Improvement Act, which reauthorizes the CALFED Bay-Delta program. The CALFED Bay-Delta Program is a unique collaboration among 25 state and federal agencies that came together with a mission to improve California&#x27;s water supply and the ecological health of the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. H.R. 2828 provides a long-term federal authorization for the western region for water supply and reliability. The bill became Public Law 108-361.

== Personal life ==
In 1993, two Corona, California, police officers found Calvert with a prostitute in his car. He told the police that he and the woman were &quot;just talking&quot;. &quot;The Press-Enterprise&quot; later went to court to force the Corona police to release the police report. After the report was released, Calvert admitted to having sex with the woman in his car; the police did not have enough evidence to arrest him, as there was no witness to any exchange of money.

Calvert is an Episcopalian.

<text>Statistics Netherlands, founded in 1899, is a Dutch governmental institution that gathers statistical information about the Netherlands. In Dutch it is known as the Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (&quot;Central Agency for Statistics&quot;), often abbreviated to CBS. It is located in The Hague and Heerlen. Since 3 January 2004, Statistics Netherlands has been an independent public body, or quango. Its independent legal status enables the reliable collection and dissemination of information to support public debate, policy development and decision-making.

CBS collects statistical information on themes such as: 
* Count of the population
* Consumer prices
* Economic growth
* Personal and household incomes
* Unemployment
* Religion

The programme of CBS needs to be ratified by the Central Commission for Statistics, which was replaced by an Advisory Board in 2016. This independent board must ensure the impartiality, independence, quality, relevance, and continuity of CBS, according to the relevant legislation (Law on the CBS (&quot;Wet op het Centraal bureau en de Centrale commissie voor de statistiek&quot;) 1996 and 2003).

==History==

CBS was established in 1899 in response to the need for independent and reliable information that advances the understanding of social issues and supports public decision making. This is still the main role of CBS. Philip Idenburg, who worked at the CBS from 1929–1966, played a key role in salvaging the work of the Mundaneum offices in The Hague, arranging for Gerd Arntz to be involved in setting up the Dutch Foundation for Statistics, which used the Isotypes previously developed by Arntz and Otto Neurath.

==Offices==
CBS has offices in The Hague and Heerlen. The office in Heerlen was located there by the government in 1973 to compensate the area for the loss of ten of thousands of jobs because of closing the coal mines. The office in The Hague with the name &#x27;Double U&#x27; was designed by Branimir Medić and Pero Puljiz. It has a surface of and the total cost was €41,000,000. The office in Heerlen was designed by Meyer en Van Schooten Architects in 2009. The office has a surface of and parking spaces for 296 cars. Glass was used everywhere in the building. The main hall has a glass roof and the outside walls are fully glass. The several straight staircases in the main hall have glass balustrades with a RVS handrail and were manufactured by EeStairs. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands officially opened the building on 30 September 2009.

<doc id="409684" wikidata="Q2703800" url="?curid=409684" title="Voies">
<text>Voies ( , feminine plural) is a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Monemvasia, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 215.527 km2. It is on the southern tip of Cape Malea. It is a predominantly agricultural region with a few minor villages and one dominant town. &quot;Vatika&quot; is the common term for the area, but &quot;Voies&quot; is used in a more official context, particularly for postal situations. &quot;Voion&quot;, the genitive, is used for description: for example, to differentiate the village of Agios Nikolaos in Voies from other villages and towns of the same name, one would use &quot;Agios Nikolaos Voion&quot;. Neapoli is the administrative capital of the municipality, and is also the urban center to the numerous villages that surround the hinterland.

In the Kato Kastania village of Voies is found the large and colorful Kastania Cave.

==Geography==
There is a single mountain range that runs through the center of the municipality dividing it into two parts, both an east and west section. Adjacent to the west coast of the region lies the island of Elafonisos. The island contains some of the oldest evidence of human inhabitance in the whole of the Peloponnese.

==Historical population==
==History==
The name of the region derives from the initial name of the town of &quot;Neapoli&quot;, &quot;Boiai&quot; (), which is thought to have been founded in the second century BC. The feminine plural ending has evolved from -αί to -ες.

The ancient writer Pausanias wrote that Boiai was founded &quot;...by Boios, one of the Heraclidae, who is supposed to have gathered the people from three cities: &quot;Etis&quot;, &quot;Aphrodisias&quot; and &quot;Side&quot;&quot;.

==Neapoli==
Neapoli ( meaning &quot;new city&quot;) () is the largest town of the former municipality. It was initially an agricultural center, but now has seen a rise in the numbers of tourists (particularly visitors to the neighbouring island of Elafonisos). The commercial center of the town is located on the water front, facing Vatika Bay. There are ferries to the islands Kythira and Elafonisos. The town is surrounded by the villages of Faraklo, Paradisi and Lachi in its hinterland, and Kambos located on the same plain as Neapoli. Neapoli has a kindergarten school, a school, a church and a square.

==Agios Nikolaos==
Agios Nikolaos () () is a small village, south-east of Neapoli. It has a largely agricultural population; however, many inhabitants are employed in the shipping industries.

==Places of interest==
*Neapoli
Villages:
*Velanidia (Βελανίδια), a Byzantine village about 17 km from Neapoli, it includes several Byzantine churches.
*Faraklo (Φάρακλο)
*Lachi (Λάχι) - Site of the Ancient city named Itis.
*Mesochori (Μεσοχώρι) - A village with Byzantine origins.
*Agios Nikolaos (Άγιος Νικόλαος) - The Agricultural center for the Municipality. The original name of the village dating back in the 17th century was &quot;Panagia&quot; from a homonymous temple of Virgin Mary. Most of the inhabitants trace their ancestry from the Western parts of Crete that was occupied by the Ottomans in 1669 resulting to a wide refugee influx in the Vatica area. Moreover, people from the island of Kythera started populating the village from the early 19th century and onwards. Known families include &quot;Nychas&quot; family presumably indigenous since the 17th century, &quot;Pavlakis&quot; Cretan ancestry and &quot;Michaletos&quot; Venetian ancestry coming from Crete as well. The village has a strong diaspora concentrated in Australia and Pretoria -South Africa.
*Paradeisi (Παραδέισι)
*Ano Kastania (Ανό Καστανία) - The location of many Byzantine Churches and Monasteries.
*Kato Kastania (Κάτο Καστανία)
*Viglafia (Βιγκλάφια)
*Elafonisos - A small island just 500 m of the coast of Vatika near Viglafia.
*Pantanassa

<doc id="409691" wikidata="Q459753" url="?curid=409691" title="Mary Bono">
<text>Mary Bono Oswald (née Whitaker and formerly Mary Bono Mack, born October 24, 1961) is an American politician, businesswoman, and lobbyist who served Palm Springs and most of central and eastern Riverside County, California, in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1998 to 2013.

A member of the Republican Party, Bono was first elected to Congress in 1998 to replace her late husband, Sonny Bono, who had died in office months earlier. She sat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and was chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade. In 1998, Bono served on the House Judiciary Committee that approved articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton. Bono served in Congress until losing her 2012 reelection bid.

In March 2013, Bono became a senior vice president at the Washington, D.C.-based federal affairs firm Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting. In 2018, she founded the political affairs consulting firm Integritas by Bono.

==Early life and education==
Bono was born Mary Whitaker in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of Karen Lee (née Taylor), a chemist, and Dr. Clay Westerfield Whitaker, a physician and World War II veteran. In 1963, the family moved to South Pasadena, California. She graduated from South Pasadena High School in 1979, then from the University of Southern California in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts in art history. Whitaker was an accomplished gymnast in her youth and worked as a cocktail waitress during her early twenties.

In 1986, Whitaker married singer, actor and politician Sonny Bono. They moved to Palm Springs, California where Sonny Bono served as mayor from 1988 to 1992 before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994. The congressman died in a skiing accident on January 5, 1998, during his second term in Congress, leaving a vacant seat in the House, which Mary Bono would then pursue.

==Career==
===U.S. House of Representatives===

In 1998, Mary Bono won the Republican nomination for the special election to succeed her late husband in what was then California&#x27;s 44th congressional district. She was then elected to Congress on April 7, 1998. Bono won election to a full term on November 3, 1998.

That same year, Bono was added to the House Judiciary Committee by the Republican leadership in anticipation of the consideration of impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, thus becoming the only Republican woman on the committee during the impeachment inquiry against Bill Clinton. Bono voted along party lines on all four motions for impeachment in both the committee and on the House floor, despite other moderate Republican House members voting against Articles II, III, and IV. Bono&#x27;s service on the House Judiciary panel increased her national profile considerably.

Bono served in Congress for 15 years. In 2011, her bill, H.R. 2715, was signed into law with bipartisan support to amend and improve the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008. The daughter of a veteran, Bono also played a key role in creation of VA clinics in Blythe and Palm Desert, California. In December 2010, she was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the United States military&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; ban on openly homosexual service members.
After the 2010 United States census, Bono&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 36th district and made somewhat more Democratic and Hispanic than its predecessor. In a significant upset, Democratic challenger Raul Ruiz, a physician, defeated her with 53 percent of the vote to Bono&#x27;s 47.1 percent.

In 2013, Bono was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

====Committee assignments====
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade (Chairwoman)
** Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
** Subcommittee on Environment and Economy
* United States House Committee on Armed Services
* United States House Committee on the Judiciary
* United States House Committee on Small Business

Bono was chairwoman of the House Energy Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade. This committee debates legislation related to intellectual property, telecommunications, energy and healthcare. She was the first Republican woman to chair this subcommittee.
She was co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Prescription Drug Abuse. In 2012, she formed and chaired the House Women&#x27;s Policy Committee, which included 24 female Republican lawmakers from 17 states.

====Caucus memberships====
* America Supports You Caucus
* Intellectual Property Promotion and Piracy Prevention Caucus (Co-chair)
* International Conservation Caucus
* Recording Arts and Sciences Caucus (Co-chair)
* Congressional Hispanic Conference (associate member)
* Republican Main Street Partnership

===Post-congressional career===
In March 2013, Bono became a senior vice president at the Washington, D.C.-based federal affairs firm Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting.

In June 2013, a group of leading telecommunications firms announced formation of the 21st Century Privacy Coalition, which focuses on updating U.S. privacy and data security laws. Mary Bono and Jon Leibowitz, former Federal Trade Commission chairman, were named co-chairs of the coalition. Also in June 2013, Bono helped lead expansion of Faegre Baker Daniels and Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting into Silicon Valley, in her home state of California.

In August 2013, Bono was a panelist at the &quot;National Journal&quot;&#x27;s Women 2020 event. At that event, she discussed gender inequality and her experiences as a woman in Congress.

In October 2018, following the Michigan State University sex abuse scandal, Bono was named interim president and chief executive officer of USA Gymnastics. However, she resigned four days later following criticism over her previous role as a lobbyist for USA Gymnastics amid public concern that she had marked out the Nike logo on her sneakers in protest of Nike&#x27;s support for NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

==Advocacy and causes==
After attending a lecture by mountaineer-turned-humanitarian Greg Mortenson, Bono worked with him to aid his efforts to build schools for girls in the mountainous regions of Pakistan. Bono is quoted in Mortenson&#x27;s book &quot;Three Cups of Tea&quot; as saying &quot;I&#x27;ve learned more from Greg Mortenson about the causes of terrorism than during all our briefings on Capitol Hill.&quot;

==Personal life==
On March 1, 1986, she married actor/singer Sonny Bono. The Bonos moved to Palm Springs, where they owned and operated a restaurant. Sonny Bono served as Mayor of Palm Springs from 1988 to 1992 before being elected to Congress in 1994. The Bonos had two children: Chesare (b. April 25, 1988) and Chianna (b. February 2, 1991). Sonny Bono died on January 5, 1998, in a skiing accident.

After Sonny Bono&#x27;s death in 1998, Bono began dating Brian Prout, drummer of the country music band Diamond Rio. The two became engaged in 2001 but did not marry.

On November 24, 2001, Bono married Wyoming businessman Glenn Baxley about 18 months after they met in Mexico. They filed for divorce in 2005.

On December 15, 2007, Bono married Congressman Connie Mack IV (R-FL) in Asheville, North Carolina. In May 2013, the couple announced they had separated on amicable terms. They divorced later that year.

On September 27, 2015, Bono married former astronaut and retired Navy rear admiral Stephen S. Oswald.

<doc id="409699" wikidata="Q176671" url="?curid=409699" title="Persistent genital arousal disorder">
<text>Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD), originally called persistent sexual arousal syndrome (PSAS), is spontaneous, persistent, unwanted and uncontrollable genital arousal in the absence of sexual stimulation or sexual desire, and is typically not relieved by orgasm. Instead, multiple orgasms over hours or days may be required for relief.

PGAD occurs in people of both sexes. It has been compared to priapism in male and female genitalia. PGAD is rare and is not well understood. The literature is inconsistent with the nomenclature. It is distinguished from hypersexuality, which is characterized as heightened sexual desire.

==Classification==
In 2003, &quot;persistent genital arousal&quot; was considered for inclusion with regard to the International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (ICSM). In 2009, &quot;persistent genital arousal dysfunction&quot; was included in its third edition. PGAD is not included in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which may be due to the disorder requiring further research.

The condition has been characterized by a researcher as being a term with no scientific basis. There is concern that the title may be misleading because, since the genital arousal is unwanted, it is dubious to characterize it as arousal.

Other researchers have suggested that the disorder be renamed &quot;persistent genital vasocongestion disorder (PGVD)&quot; or &quot;restless genital syndrome (ReGS).&quot;

==Signs and symptoms==
Physical arousal caused by PGAD can be very intense and persist for extended periods, days, weeks or years at a time. Symptoms may include pressure, pain, vibrating, pleasure, irritation, clitoral or penile tingling, throbbing, vaginal congestion, vaginal contractions, penile spasms, arousal, clitoral or penile erections, and prolonged spontaneous orgasms. Pressure, pleasure, discomfort, pounding, pulsating, throbbing or engorgement may include the clitoris, penis, labia, vagina, perineum, or the anus. The symptoms may result from sexual activity or from no identified stimulus, and are not relieved by a single orgasm; instead, multiple strong orgasms over hours, days, or weeks are needed for short term relief. The symptoms can impede home or work life. Women and men may feel embarrassment or shame, and avoid sexual relationships, because of the disorder. Stress can make the symptoms worse.

==Cause==
Researchers do not know the cause of PGAD, but assume that it has neurological, vascular, pharmacological, and psychological causes. Tarlov cysts have been speculated as a cause. PGAD has been associated with clitoral priapism, and has been compared to priapism in men. It is also similar to vulvodynia, in that the causes for both are not well understood, both last for a long time, and women with either condition may be told that it is psychological rather than physical. It has been additionally associated with restless legs syndrome (RLS), but only in a minority of women, as well as men.

In some recorded cases, the syndrome was caused by or can cause a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial branches to the clitoris. Surgical treatment was effective in this instance. There is evidence that some drugs such as SSRIs and SNRIs might induce or worsen PGAD.

==Diagnosis==
The following five criteria must be met by patients in order to be diagnosed with PGAD:

# Typical physiological responses from sexual arousal persist for an extended amount of time and do not cease on their own
# Feelings of arousal remain even after orgasm or multiple orgasms are needed to lessen the arousal
# Arousal is experienced without desire or sexual excitement
# Arousal occurs with both sexual and non-sexual stimuli or with no stimuli
# Symptoms are intrusive, unwanted, and cause distress

==Treatment==
Because PGAD has only been researched since 2001, there is little documenting what may cure or remedy the disorder. Treatment may include extensive psychotherapy, psycho-education, and pelvic floor physical therapy. In one case, serendipitous relief of symptoms was concluded from treatment with varenicline, a treatment for nicotine addiction. It was reported in a study that repeated masturbation (51%), strong or prolonged orgasms (50%), distraction (39%), intercourse (36%), exercise (25%), and cold compresses (13%) were the most relieving treatments that could be done without the help of a professional.

Having a team of professionals such as a medical provider, a pelvic floor physical therapist, massage therapist and sex therapist has been shown to aid patients. One study found that, after working with professionals, patients felt validated, listened to, and that their sexual function had improved. Many patients felt practicing mindfulness allowed them to adjust to living with PGAD by recognizing thoughts and emotions corresponding to the symptoms and avoiding brooding over them. This treatment method focuses on reducing the anxiety that is caused by the condition and pushes the patient to develop effective distraction and relaxation techniques.

==Epidemiology==
PGAD is very rare and is believed to affect about 1% of women; it is considered even rarer in men. Although online surveys have indicated that hundreds of women and men may have PGAD, documented case studies have been limited.

==History==
The earliest references to PGAD may be Greek descriptions of hypersexuality (previously known as &quot;satyriasis&quot; and &quot;nymphomania&quot;), which confused persistent genital arousal with sexual insatiability. While PGAD involves the absence of sexual desire, hypersexuality is characterized as heightened sexual desire.

The term &quot;persistent sexual arousal syndrome&quot; was coined by researchers Leiblum and Nathan in 2001. In 2006, Leiblum renamed the condition to &quot;persistent genital arousal disorder&quot; to indicate that genital arousal sensations are different from those that result from true sexual arousal. The rename was also considered to give the condition a better chance of being classified as a dysfunction. Now PGAD is often called or termed Genito-Pelvic Dysesthesia.

== Impact on mental health ==
Women and men with PGAD report having unstable mental health with thoughts of suicide and difficulty completing daily activities. Most people that suffer from PGAD report having to masturbate 6, 20 or even more times a day and may have to use many types of sexual devices to experience any type of relief from symptoms. Many people are afraid to leave their homes due to fears that PGAD symptoms may flare up while in public and they will not be able to wait until they are able to relieve themselves.

Before the start of their PGAD, many women were seen to have higher stress scores as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety. Panic attacks (31.6%) and major depression (57.9%) were reported commonalities between patients occurring at least one year prior to the onset of PGAD symptoms. Up to 45% of women and men with the disorder have reported having a history with antidepressants.

A small study found that several women and men began to see symptoms of PGAD after discontinuing the use of their selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It is not known whether reintroduction of the SSRIs would improve PGAD symptoms.

This tower has stones engraved with unknown symbols, and was built during the Marcomanni rule over Bohemia, in the 1st century BC and 2nd century AD. It was integrated into Zvíkov castle hundreds of years later. Strange events occur here frequently, including weird photos, technical problems, unpredictable behaviour of animals, spontaneous extinguishing of fires, electromagnetic anomalies, and the presence of ghosts.

*Omenainen, an uninhabited island in the municipality of Nagu (now Pargas) in the central Archipelago Sea, which was formerly a burial ground for those parishioners of Rymättylä and Nagu whom the church refused to bury in consecrated ground (because they&#x27;d committed, for example, murder, and other sins).

*Wolfsegg, Bavaria, Wolfsegg Castle: This 14th-century castle was supposed to be a sanctuary for travellers. The folklore of this haunting originated from the 1500s, when Ulrich von Laaber hired two young farmers to kill his wife, Klara von Helfenstein, after discovering she was having an affair. Soon thereafter, Ulrich and his sons also died suddenly. There have been reports of strange noises coming out of a cave area near the castle. Several expeditions into the cave, uncovering numerous animal skeletons, leading locals to decide the noises had come from hunters who were hiding their prey.

<doc id="409703" wikidata="Q301338" url="?curid=409703" title="Stourhead">
<text>Stourhead () is a 1,072-hectare (2,650-acre) estate at the source of the River Stour in the southwest of the English county of Wiltshire, extending into Somerset.

The estate is about northwest of the town of Mere and includes a Grade I listed 18th-century Neo-Palladian mansion, the village of Stourton, one of the most famous gardens in the English landscape garden style, farmland, and woodland. Stourhead has been part-owned by the National Trust since 1946.

==House==
The Stourton family had lived at the Stourhead estate for 500 years until they sold it to Sir Thomas Meres in 1714. His son, John Meres, sold it in 1717 to Henry Hoare, son of wealthy banker Sir Richard Hoare. The original manor house was demolished and a new house, one of the first of its kind, was designed by Colen Campbell and built by Nathaniel Ireson between 1721 and 1725.

Over the next 200 years, the Hoare family collected many heirlooms, including a large library and art collection. In 1902, the house was gutted by fire but many of the heirlooms were saved, and the house was rebuilt in a nearly identical style.

The last Hoare family member to own the property, Sir Henry Hugh Arthur Hoare, 6th Baronet, gave the house and gardens to the National Trust in 1946, one year before his death. His son and sole heir, Captain Henry Colt Arthur &quot;Harry&quot; Hoare, of the Queen&#x27;s Own Dorset Yeomanry, had died of wounds received at the Battle of Mughar Ridge on 13 November 1917 during World War I. The last Hoare family member to be born at the house was Edward Hoare on 11 October 1949.

The house was recorded as Grade I listed in 1966.

== Art collection ==
Henry Hoare&#x27;s art collection is displayed at Stourhead; his acquisitions are featured in the Palladian mansion&#x27;s &#x27;Painted Alcove&#x27; or Italian Room. Hoare&#x27;s collection includes many hand-coloured prints – in some cases, coloured with such skill that they were mistaken for oil paintings. These prints are engravings of the works of the Italian masters (for example Daniele da Volterra, and Carlo Maratta) and the hand-colouring is attributed to a &quot;Mr. Studio&quot;, thought to be Giacomo Van Lint, the son of Flemish painter Hendrik van Lint (possibly in collaboration with his father).

==Other buildings==
Although the main design for the estate at Stourhead was the work of Colen Campbell, other architects were involved in its evolution through the years. William Benson, Henry Hoare&#x27;s brother-in-law, was in part responsible for the building of the estate in 1719. Francis Cartwright, a master builder and architect, who was established as a &quot;competent provincial designer in the Palladian manner&quot;, worked on Stourhead between 1749 and 1755. Cartwright was a known carver, presumably of materials such as wood and stone, and it is assumed that his contribution to Stourhead was in this capacity. Nathaniel Ireson is the master builder credited for much of the work on the Estate: it is this work that established his career, in 1720.

The original estate remained intact, though changes and additions were made over time. Henry Flitcroft built three temples and a tower on the property: the Temple of Ceres was added in 1744, followed by the Temple of Hercules in 1754 and the Temple of Apollo in 1765; that same year he designed Alfred&#x27;s Tower, which was not built until 1772. During the ownership of Sir Richard Colt Hoare, the mason and surveyor John Carter added an ornamental cottage to the grounds (1806) and the architect William Wilkins created a Grecian style lodge (1816).

In 1840, over a century after the initial buildings were constructed, Charles Parker was hired by Sir Hugh Richard Hoare, 4th Baronet to make changes to the estate. A portico was added to the main house, along with other alterations. The design of the additions was in keeping with original plans.

==Gardens and monuments==
The lake at Stourhead is artificially created. Following a path around the lake is meant to evoke a journey similar to that of Aeneas&#x27;s descent into the underworld. In addition to Greek mythology, the layout is evocative of the &quot;genius of the place&quot;, a concept expounded by Alexander Pope. Buildings and monuments are erected in remembrance of family and local history. Henry Hoare was a collector of art; one of his pieces was Claude Lorrain&#x27;s &quot;Aeneas at Delos&quot;, which is thought to have inspired the pictorial design of the gardens. Passages telling of Aeneas&#x27;s journey are quoted in the temples surrounding the lake.

Monuments are used to frame one another; for example the Pantheon designed by Flitcroft entices the visitor over, but once reached, views from the opposite shore of the lake beckon. The use of the sunken path allows the landscape to continue on into neighbouring landscapes, allowing the viewer to contemplate all the surrounding panorama. The Pantheon was thought to be the most important visual feature of the gardens. It appears in many pieces of artwork owned by Hoare, depicting Aeneas&#x27;s travels. The plantings in the garden were arranged in a manner that would evoke different moods, drawing visitors through realms of thought. According to Henry Hoare, &#x27;The greens should be ranged together in large masses as the shades are in painting: to contrast the dark masses with the light ones, and to relieve each dark mass itself with little sprinklings of lighter greens here and there.&#x27;

The gardens were designed by Henry Hoare II and laid out between 1741 and 1780 in a classical 18th-century design set around a large lake, achieved by damming a small stream. The inspiration behind their creation were the painters Claude Lorrain, Poussin, and, in particular, Gaspard Dughet, who painted Utopian-type views of Italian landscapes. An early feature, predating the lake, is the Temple of Flora (1744–46) which now contains a replica of the Borghese Vase modelled in Coade stone dating from 1770 to 1771. Lakeside features include the five-arched Palladian Bridge at the eastern extremity of the lake; the Rockwork Bridge over the road to the south of the lake; and to the west the grotto and the Gothic Cottage summerhouse.

Also in the garden are a number of temples inspired by scenes of the Grand Tour of Europe. On one hill overlooking the gardens stand an obelisk of 1839 and King Alfred&#x27;s Tower, a 50-metre-tall, brick folly designed by Henry Flitcroft in 1772; on another hill the temple of Apollo provides a vantage point to survey the rhododendrons, water, cascades and temples. The large medieval Bristol High Cross was moved from Bristol to the gardens. The gardens are home to a large collection of trees and shrubs from around the world.

Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet, the grandson of Henry Hoare II, inherited Stourhead in 1783. He added the library wing to the mansion, and in the garden was responsible for the building of the boathouse and the removal of several features that were not in keeping with the classical and gothic styles (including a Turkish Tent). He also considerably enhanced the planting – the Temple of Apollo rises from a wooded slope that was planted in Colt Hoare&#x27;s time. With the antiquarian passion of the times, he had 400 ancient burial mounds dug up to inform his pioneering &quot;History of Ancient Wiltshire&quot;.

The gardens were listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in 1987.

==In typography==
The National Trust&#x27;s corporate font, designed by Paul Barnes, is based on an inscription in the grotto, created around 1748. The inscription was destroyed in error around 1960 and a replica was made from photographs.

<doc id="409704" wikidata="Q7744696" url="?curid=409704" title="The Kingsway, Toronto">
<text>The Kingsway is a residential neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is bounded by Bloor Street to the south, Dundas Street to the north, the Mimico Creek to the west and the Humber River to the east. The neighbourhood was officially known as Kingsway Park, which later became replaced by its nickname the Kingsway. In this neighbourhood, &quot;the Kingsway&quot; specifically refers to a two-lane road beginning in the south-east corner of the neighbourhood extending northerly in a north-west direction past Dundas Street. 

For planning purposes, the neighbourhood is known by the City of Toronto as &quot;Kingsway South&quot; to differentiate it from a more recent extension of the Kingsway road north of Dundas Street. &quot;Kingsway South&quot; is not used by residents, due to confusion with the South Kingsway, a street located east of the Humber River and extending south from Bloor Street. Originally the Kingsway road and South Kingsway were supposed to be one continuous route, however the intended connection (including a crossing of the Humber River) was instead occupied by the westward extension of Bloor Street. South Kingsway consequently acts as a southern continuation of Jane Street, and continues south where it interchanges with the Queensway before ending at the Gardiner Expressway.

==Character==
The neighbourhood is predominantly residential with a mixed-use (commercial and residential) area along Bloor and Dundas Streets. The majority of the housing stock is single-family detached homes. There are apartment and condominium buildings near the Old Mill, Royal York and Islington subway stations, with a further mix of buildings along Bloor and Dundas Streets. A rail line runs through the north-west quadrant of the neighbourhood. Parkland lines the banks of the Humber River and Mimico Creek.

==History==

The area now known as the Kingsway is a combination of three distinct areas:
* The first area to be built on was south of Government Road, east of Prince Edward Drive which formed the government King&#x27;s Mill Reserve; a large forested area with the Old Mill at the centre, on Bloor beside the Humber River. This part of the modern Kingsway, now centred on the street the Kingsway, was the least developed area until the neighbourhood was subdivided; it is now the most exclusive (and leafy) part of the Kingsway as well as its namesake; the street the Kingsway beginning at gates beside the Old King&#x27;s Mill.
* Along Dundas from the Humber River to Royal York was the Etobicoke side of York Township&#x27;s community of Lambton Mills. With a second mill on the western (Etobicoke) side, this area was the first to develop but is today the least affluent part of the Kingsway.
* South of Bloor, west of Prince Edward Drive formed a typical farming community dominated by the Thompson family; sometimes called Thompson Estates by local developers. Today this community is only slightly less affluent than the former Kingsmill, although picturesque along the Mimico Creek which winds through the former Thompson farms. One of the two Thompson homes, Spring Bank Cottage, survives facing Royal York at the top of the hill overlooking Mimico Creek.

===The Kingsway Garden Subdivision===

The neighbourhood was first developed by Etobicoke lawyer Robert Home Smith who purchased the old King&#x27;s Mill (which was renamed the Old Mill, reopening as a high-end Inn) and began developing land in the early 1900s. The Kingsway emerged from Home Smith&#x27;s vision of the ideal community and was mostly inspired by the Garden City principles, which were originally conceived in parts of England and the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Indeed, Smith was a big fan of everything English, and this inclination instructed his ideas for the neighbourhood. By the 1920s, those ideas culminated into the development, which he named Kingsway Park.

&quot;Tastefully appointed&quot; traditional homes were sited on well-treed and winding streets, to create an air of a wooded retreat. Home Smith also decreed that no owner could build a house without the approval of his staff, and he developed strict regulations against the cutting of trees. Most of the homes were designed in the Arts and crafts style, which had become popular during that time. Smith insisted on the use of locally sourced materials for the houses in Kingsway Park, such as sandstone quarried from around the Humber River and Credit River areas.

Kingsway Park was aimed at affluent home buyers. Street names such as Queen Anne Road and Kingsgarden Road emphasized the appearance of English respectability and affluence that Smith was selling. Smith also created the Old Mill Restaurant in the community, whose Tudor Revival facade and well-appointed interior inspired much of the English design in the Kingsway.

Despite its well-intentioned approach to traditionalism, the Kingsway was a neighbourhood built for the automobile, and all houses were built with discreetly placed garages, as per Smith&#x27;s wishes.

===Recent development===

In the 1950s a series of accidents led to the creation of a highway style interchange at Royal York and Dundas, cutting the neighbourhood from the much older community of Islington to the west and the street the Kingsway from its extension to the north. Consequently, the neighbourhood along the Kingsway north of Dundas developed in a radically different way than that to the south had done. The stretch of Bloor east of Prince Edward Drive near the entrance to the street the Kingsway and the Old Mill saw the construction of many apartment buildings in this period.

The community in the Kingsway has been very successful in preserving the style of housing and atmosphere of the neighbourhood as intended by Robert Home Smith; the area contains many of Etobicoke&#x27;s most prestigious addresses.

==Transportation==

The area is served by the Royal York and Old Mill TTC subway stations. The 73 Royal York and 48 Rathburn buses run north from the Royal York station. The 66 Prince Edward bus line run north and south from the Old Mill station.

===Main streets===
&quot;The Kingsway&quot; road is a two-lane road beginning in the south-east corner of the neighbourhood from Bloor Street and extending northerly in a north-west direction past Dundas Street. Originally the Kingsway road and South Kingsway were supposed to be one continuous route, however the intended connection (including a crossing of the Humber River) was instead occupied by the westward extension of Bloor Street. South Kingsway consequently acts as a southern continuation of Jane Street, and continues south where it interchanges with the Queensway before ending at the Gardiner Expressway. 

Bloor Street is the southern boundary of the neighbourhood and also a major east–west arterial roadway and commercial district. Prince Edward, a two-lane arterial roadway, runs north–south from Berry Road to Dundas Street West. Dundas Street West is the northern boundary of the neighbourhood and also a major east–west arterial roadway. There is some commercial and institutional uses along the roadway within the neighbourhood.

==Education==

Two public school boards operate schools in the Kingsway, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). The TDSB operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, Etobicoke Collegiate Institute. The secondary school was established in the fall of 1928 and is the first and traditionally central school for Etobicoke.

Lambton-Kingsway Junior Middle School is a public elementary school on Prince Edward Drive, close to the intersection of Dundas Street West and Royal York Road. The present building opened in January 1993.

Schools located in the Kingsway that are operated by TCDSB include:
* Our Lady of Sorrows Elementary School is a Catholic school situated on Montgomery Road near the intersection of Bloor Street and Royal York Road. Established in 1942 out of Etobicoke&#x27;s oldest parish, Our Lady of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church, Kingsway. Our Lady of Sorrows once served much of the then largely rural, Etobicoke until post war urbanisation led to the creation of many new parishes to the north. Our Lady of Sorrows is now a feeder school for Bishop Allen Academy. The original school building was demolished from 2001 to 2002, and in 2003 the new school building was completed.
*Bishop Allen Academy is a Catholic high school located on Royal York Rd.

In addition to public schools, the Kingsway is also home to Kingsway College School, a private school affiliated with the Anglican Church, located at 4600 Dundas Street West.

<doc id="409710" wikidata="Q190699" url="?curid=409710" title="Libyan dinar">
<text>The dinar ( (); sign: LD in Latin, ل.د in Arabic; code: LYD) is the official currency of Libya. The dinar is divided into 1,000 dirhams (). It is issued by the Central Bank of Libya, which also supervises the banking system and regulates credit.

==History==
It was introduced in September 1971 and replaced the pound at par. The currency was pegged to the special drawing rights at a rate of 2.80 SDRs per dinar.

In 1972, the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank was established to deal with overseas investment.

In February 1973, the dinar was pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 0.29679 dinar per dollar (LD 1 = US$3.37), which was maintained until 1986. The peg was switched to the special drawing rights on 18 March 1986, with 1 dinar = 2.80 SDRs. On 1 May 1986, the dinar was allowed to trade in a 7.5% range of 2.80 SDRs. This range was expanded several times.

The currency started to devalue gradually relative to the US dollar in the mid-1990s, reaching a value of US$1.55 in 2001. The dinar was devalued by 50% to US$0.77 in 2002.

Ali Mohammed Salem, deputy governor of Central Bank of Libya, stated the exchange rate of Libyan dinar would be pegged to special drawing rights for one to three years, according to an interview to Reuters on 27 December 2011.

On 3 January 2021, the dinar was devalued to US$1 = LD 4.48 for all transactions following exchange rate unification, closing the gap between the official and black market exchange rates.

==Coins==
Until 1975, old coins denominated in milliemes (equal to the dirham) circulated. In 1975, coins were introduced in denominations of 1 Dh., 5 Dhs., 10 Dhs., 20 Dhs., 50 Dhs. and 100 Dhs. which bore the coat of arms of the Federation of Arab Republics. These were followed in 1979 by a second series of coins, in the same denominations, which bore a design of a horseman in place of the arms. LD  and LD  coins were issued in 2001 and 2004, respectively. In 2009, new 50 dhs., 100 dhs., LD  and LD  coins were issued. 1 dh., 5 dhs., 10 dhs., and 20 dhs. coins are rarely used as units of exchange. However, they still retain their status as legal tender.

In 2013 and 2014, the Central Bank of Libya issued LD  and LD  coins and 50 Dhs. and 100 Dhs. coins.
==Banknotes==
In 1971, banknotes were introduced in denominations of LD , LD , LD 1, LD 5 and LD 10. On May 15, 1980, new banknotes were issued for the LD 5 and LD 10 denominations (worth, at the time, £7stg and £14 stg, or US$16 and US$32) and Libyan citizens were allowed one week to exchange their existing notes at the Central State Bank branches, after which the old LD 5 and LD 10 notes would be worthless. Persons making the exchange, however, were informed that only LD 1,000 worth of new notes would be allowed per customer, a move that &quot;effectively wiped out the savings of the middle-class as well as the hoarded cash of the black marketeers&quot; and that &quot;brought a windfall of £1.5 billion to the cash-starved Treasury&quot;. After a public uproar, Leader Muammar Gaddafi announced on June 11 that although the seized money would not be confiscated or invested without full consultation with the 167 local &quot;People&#x27;s Congresses&quot; in Libya.

Notes of LD 20 were added in 2002. On August 27, 2008, the Central Bank of Libya announced a new LD 50 note and that was scheduled to enter circulation on August 31, 2008. The note was already in circulation and featured Gaddafi on the obverse.

The subjects depicted on the banknotes have not changed since series 2 except for the portrait of Gaddafi which became the new obverse design of the LD 1 note in series 4.

After the overthrow of Gaddafi&#x27;s government in the First Libyan Civil War of 2011, Central Bank Governor Gasem Azzoz said that notes with the ousted strongman&#x27;s face on them were still in circulation and would be used by the National Transitional Council to pay the salaries of public servants and government employees. The bank is holding a contest for redesigned banknotes that will likely eventually replace the Gaddafi-emblazoned notes.

The central Bank started withdrawing the LD 50 note on January 14, 2012. Libyans have until March 15 to hand the note in to banks. Issam Buajila, the media manager of the central bank said that the LD 1 and LD 20 notes will be withdrawn from circulation soon. Omar Elkaber, governor of the central bank, stated that the bank has already started printing new notes.

The Central Bank of Libya has issued a revised LD 10 banknote with revised features, one example is the removal of the reference of the Gaddafi era &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; from upper right back, plus the use of English on the notes for the first time in two decades. Furthermore, the serial number prefix system has apparently been reset to &quot;1&quot;. Two versions of the revised LD 10 banknote were issued, one with the central bank&#x27;s name rendered with initial-capitals, which were printed by De La Rue of the UK and the other with the central bank&#x27;s name in all capital letters were printed by Oberthur Technologies of France. Another notable differences for the two notes is both the holographic patch, the symbols on the top left corner on the notes and the date. The De La Rue version is identical to its previous issue, but the only notable difference is the serial number prefix, identified as &quot;7A&quot;. The Oberthur Technologies issue has a different holographic patch, the addition of the crescent and star symbol on the top left corner of the note, the serial number prefix as &quot;1&quot; and the date 17.02.2011 (February 17, 2011, the date of the 2011 Libyan revolution and civil war) added below.

A revised LD 5 banknote was issued with altered features similar to the revised LD 10 banknote. The English text has replaced the Arabic text on the back, the removal of the Gaddafi era &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; from the front and upper right back of the note, and the Gaddafi era falcon crest has been removed from the monument to the Battle of Al-Hani.

On February 17, 2013, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Libyan civil war, the Central Bank of Libya issued a LD 1 banknote, its first issue following the 2011 Libyan revolution and civil war. The front of the note depicts Anti-Gaddafi protesters with the flag of the Libyan rebels. The back of the note depicts the flag of Libya and peace doves.

On March 31, 2013, the Central Bank of Libya issued a LD 20 banknote. The predominantly orange-colored note features a school in Ghadames on the front and the Al-Ateeq mosque and the oasis of Oujla on the back.

In June 2013, the Central Bank of Libya issued a LD 50 banknote. The green-colored note features the Italian lighthouse in Benghazi on the front and the Rock formation in the Tadrart Acacus mountains on the back. This is the first note in Libya to utilize Crane&#x27;s &quot;Motion&quot; thread.

===Current series===
==Popular nomenclature and denominations==
The Libyan dinar is commonly called &quot;jni,&quot; (western Libyan Dialect) or &quot;jneh&quot; (eastern Libyan dialect), derived from the name of British guinea (cf &quot;genēh&quot; جنيه for the Egyptian pound), a gold coin worth twenty-one shillings. The name &quot;dinar&quot; is rarely used outside official circles. The authorized fractional unit, the dirham, is never mentioned in everyday conversation. &quot;Garsh&quot; - a variant of the word qirsh - is employed instead, with 1 &quot;garsh&quot; = 10 dirhams. One thousand dinars is stylishly called a &quot;kilo&quot; . Similarly, five dinar notes and ten dinar notes are sometimes nicknamed, in the younger generation male slang, &quot;faifa&quot; and &quot;tsena&quot; respectively, which are playful feminizations of the English words five and ten, but may also be remnants of British slang words &#x27;fiver&#x27; and &#x27;tenner&#x27; for five and ten pound notes respectively. Libyan currency is nicknamed by Libyans ʿOmar El-Mokhtar after the Libyan freedom fighter who is featured on the obverse of the LD 10 note.

==Eastern Libyan dinar==
Since 2016, the Central Bank of Libya allied with the House of Representatives and issued its own Libyan dinar, with banknotes for LD 20 and LD 50 and a LD 1 coin, which was printed and coined by Goznak in Russia. They were issued in response to a shortage of cash in the eastern half of the country, reflecting the disunity of Libya that has two rival governments in the east and west.

<doc id="409712" wikidata="Q1752801" url="?curid=409712" title="Rock in Opposition">
<text>Rock in Opposition or RIO was a movement representing a collective of progressive rock bands in the late 1970s united in their opposition to the music industry that refused to recognise their music. It was initiated by English avant-rock group Henry Cow in March 1978 when they invited four mainland European groups to come to London and perform in a festival called &quot;Rock in Opposition&quot;.

==History==
Henry Cow spent most of their last five years touring mainland Europe. There they encountered many innovative groups who were virtually unknown outside their own countries. What Henry Cow had in common with these groups was that record companies were not interested in their music. Henry Cow&#x27;s contract with Virgin Records was cancelled when Virgin realized the band were not profitable.

In early 1978, Nick Hobbs, Henry Cow&#x27;s manager at the time, decided to expose some of these European groups to British audiences and invited them to tour the United Kingdom with Henry Cow under the banner &quot;Rock in Opposition&quot;. With the help of a £1000 grant from the British Arts Council, Hobbs organised a Rock in Opposition festival in London with the slogan: &quot;The music the record companies don&#x27;t want you to hear&quot;. The event took place on 12 March 1978 at the New London Theatre with the following groups performing:
:*Henry Cow (England)
:*Stormy Six (Italy)
:*Samla Mammas Manna (Sweden)
:*Univers Zero (Belgium)
:*Etron Fou Leloublan (France)

The tour of the UK never materialised, but the festival did generate &quot;a lot of press around the world&quot;, and this prompted the five bands to discuss future plans. While &quot;Rock in Opposition&quot; was never intended to be a formal organisation, they met at Sunrise Studio in Kirchberg, Switzerland in December 1978 to reconstitute the movement as a collective. By this time Henry Cow no longer existed as a group, but as RIO&#x27;s prime mover its former members still actively participated.

RIO&#x27;s primary aim was to represent and promote its members. It was decided that membership should remain closed and small, although new members would be welcome provided they (i) adhered to &quot;musical excellence&quot; (as evaluated by the collective); (ii) worked actively &quot;outside the music business&quot;; and (iii) had a &quot;social commitment to Rock&quot;. Using these criteria, three new members were elected:
:*Art Zoyd (France)
:*Art Bears (England, made up of former Henry Cow members)
:*Aksak Maboul (Belgium)

A second RIO festival, organised by Stormy Six, took place between 26 April and 1 May 1979 at al Teatro dell&#x27;Elfo in Milan, Italy where all seven groups performed, the original four (minus Henry Cow) plus the three new groups. During the festival, the RIO members met formally again to discuss the way forward. However, despite some constructive discussion, disagreements arose between the groups regarding RIO&#x27;s role and matters were left unresolved. Two further RIO festivals took place in Sweden and Belgium, but no new meetings, and by the end of 1979, RIO as an organisation had &quot;quietly slipped away&quot;.

===Recommended Records===
Towards the end of 1978, Chris Cutler from Henry Cow and Art Bears and one of the active participants in RIO, had established Recommended Records (RēR), an independent record label and distribution network for RIO and similar artists. When RIO folded as an organisation, RēR continued RIO&#x27;s work by representing and promoting marginalised musicians and groups. RēR became a &quot;virtual&quot; RIO, and &quot;... is part of the continuing legacy of RIO&quot;.

===RIO as a genre===
RIO became a minor category or genre after it ceased being an organisation at the end of 1979. While the term &quot;RIO&quot; was never used to refer to a particular style of music during the organisation&#x27;s existence (the original RIO bands were quite diverse musically), it became used by listeners, musicians, and distributors as a means of classifying a particular subset of avant-garde artists. Avant-prog (short for avant-garde progressive rock) is a style that appeared in the late 1970s as the extension of two separate prog rock sub-styles: RIO and the Canterbury scene.

==&quot;Reunions&quot;==
A &quot;reunion&quot; festival took place at the Maison de la Musique de Cap Découverte in Carmaux, France in April 2007. The spirit of the original festival was preserved in that only artists of quality, innovation and the willingness to be &quot;in opposition&quot; to the commercial music industry performed. The festival was organised by French music promoter Michel Besset and Roger Trigaux of Present, who received Chris Cutler&#x27;s sanction to use the name &quot;Rock in Opposition&quot;. The line-up at this event included: Magma, Faust, the Peter Blegvad Trio (including Chris Cutler), Present, Zao, Mats/Morgan, Guapo, NeBeLNeST, Salle Gaveau and GMEA.

A second edition of the France RIO event took place in September 2009 at the same venue as the first, and with the following line-up: Yolk, Aranis, The Muffins, Charles Hayward, Kōenji Hyakkei, Present, Magma, Univers Zero, Combat Astronomy, Electric Epic, Guapo and GMEA. The third &quot;reunion&quot; festival also took place at the same venue in September 2010, and featured Art Bears Songbook (UK, USA), Gong (France, UK), Caspar Brötzmann Massaker (Germany), Sleepytime Gorilla Museum (USA), Rational Diet (Belarus), Jannick Top/Infernal Machina (France), Thierry Zaboitzeff (ex Art Zoyd) &quot;Cross the Bridge&quot; (France, Austria), Full Blast (Germany, Switzerland), Miriodor (Canada), Genevieve Foccroulle (Belgique) and Aquaserge (France).

The fourth edition of the France RIO also took place in September 2011, with a line-up of: Arno, Univers Zero + Present + Aranis (&quot;Once Upon a Time in Belgium&quot;), Alamaailman Vasarat, Vialka, Yugen, Gargantua, Panzerballett, Jack Dupon, Grumpf Quartet, Sax Ruins vs. Ruins Alone vs. Ono Ryoko, and Dispositivoperilanciobliquodiunasferetta. The 2011 event was covered in the 2012 documentary film &quot;Romantic Warriors II: A Progressive Music Saga About Rock in Opposition&quot; by Adele Schmidt and José Zegarra Holder.

Two RIO festivals took place in 2014, the seventh French event in Carmaux in September, and a Japanese edition of the festival in Tokyo in November. The line-up for the Japanese event was: Aranis (Belgium), The Artaud Beats (UK), Happy Family (Japan), Koenji Hyakkei (Japan), Mats/Morgan Band (Sweden), Picchio dal Pozzo (Italy), Richard Pinhas (France), Present (Belgium), Le Silo (Japan), SOLA / Lars Holmer&#x27;s Global Home Project (Sweden/Japan). Cutler, who features in The Artaud Beats, said of RIO Japan: &quot;[RIO] is changed of course; back then it was a musician-led exercise in self-sufficiency fighting for new musical forms and independence from the institutions; now it is recast as a celebration of those times and those bands, and of the music they inspired. [...] Which, I suppose, is the way it should be. RIO ceased to be ours long ago; now it&#x27;s yours. Take care with it.&quot;

The 10th Rock in Opposition festival took place in Carmaux, France on 15, 16, 17 September 2017, and featured Aranis (Belgium), Cheer-Accident (US), faUSt (Germany), Le Silo (Japan), Miriodor (Canada), Trans-aeolian Transmission (France), Gong (France), Acid Mothers Temple (Japan), a.P.A.t.T. (England), In Love With (France), Guapo (England) and Slapp Happy (Germany/England).

<doc id="409713" wikidata="Q553335" url="?curid=409713" title="Christopher Cox">
<text>Charles Christopher Cox (born October 16, 1952) is an American attorney and politician who served as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a 17-year Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, and member of the White House staff in the Reagan Administration. Prior to his Washington service he was a practicing attorney, teacher, and entrepreneur. Following his retirement from government in 2009, he returned to law practice and currently serves as a director, trustee, and advisor to several for-profit and nonprofit organizations.

==Early life and education==
Cox was born in St. Paul, Minnesota. After graduating from Saint Thomas Academy in Mendota Heights, Minnesota in 1970, Cox earned a Bachelor of Arts degree the University of Southern California in 1973, following an accelerated three-year course. He was also a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. In 1977, he earned both an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School and a J.D. from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;.

==Career==

From 1977 to 1978, he served as law clerk to Judge Herbert Choy of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

In October 1978, Cox was paralyzed from the waist down following a serious off-road Jeep accident in the rainforest on the Hawaiian island of Molokai. He eventually regained the ability to walk but wore a harness of steel bars and leather straps for six months. He still has two metal screws in his back, and according to a 2005 &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine profile, “has been in pain every day for the past 27 years.” Since he can&#x27;t sit for extended periods of time, he has a special desk that allows him to work while standing.

As a contestant on the NBC-TV game show &quot;Password Plus&quot;, Cox won more than $5,000 over multiple appearances. According to a re-broadcast of &quot;Password Plus&quot; on the cable network GSN, Cox appeared in 1980 and won $5,400 cash.

From 1977 to 1986, Cox was first an associate and then partner with the international law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins. At the time of his retirement in 1986 he was the Partner in Charge of the Corporate Department in the Orange County office, and served as a member of the firm&#x27;s national management. In 1982–83, Cox took a leave of absence from Latham &amp; Watkins to teach federal income tax at Harvard Business School.

In 1984, Cox co-founded Context Corporation, which produced daily English reproductions of the leading Soviet state-controlled newspaper, &quot;Pravda&quot;. The publication was used chiefly by U.S. universities and U.S. government agencies, and was eventually distributed to customers in 26 countries around the world. The company had no connection to the Soviet government.

=== White House ===
During the second term of Ronald Reagan from 1986 to 1988, Cox served as senior associate counsel to the president. His duties included advising on the nomination of three Supreme Court justices, the establishment of the Brady Commission following the 1987 market crash, and the drafting of legislative reform proposals for the federal budget process.

In 1986, following Chief Justice Warren Burger&#x27;s confidential message to President Reagan that he planned to step down from the bench, White House Counsel Peter Wallison tasked a small team including Cox with thoroughly researching the opinions and judicial philosophies of the leading candidates for the next Supreme Court nomination. The effort focused on judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals who had a substantial record of decisions. After narrowing the field to five or six, the search quickly settled on Judge Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, a recommendation the president accepted.

As a part of his White House responsibilities, Cox also reviewed the FBI files of nominees for presidential appointments.

When Howard Baker took over for Donald Regan as chief of staff in 1987, bringing with him Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. as counsel to the president, First Lady Nancy Reagan specifically asked Culvahouse to keep Cox on the White House staff. According to Culvahouse, she and the East Wing staff &quot;liked Chris a lot ... He is a very good lawyer,&quot; and his willingness to give up his partnership in a prestigious law firm to join the White House staff only a year before had made an impression. As senior associate counsel under Culvahouse, Cox became deeply involved in market issues and securities issues including then-pending congressional proposals for legislation on insider trading, greenmail, junk bonds, golden parachutes and golden handcuffs, tender offers, and takeovers.

His work on the White House response to the 1987 stock market crash included the formation of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms and the recruitment of Harvard Business School professor Robert Glauber, who had been Cox&#x27;s department chairman during his stint on the faculty there, as its executive director. The Commission provided the definitive autopsy on what happened to the markets on Black Monday, October 19, 1987, and its aftermath. Coincidentally, eight months prior to the crash, Chief of Staff Howard Baker had asked Cox to write a detailed memo describing the emergency powers that the President might exercise in a market crisis. That landed Cox in an emergency meeting in the chief of staff&#x27;s office on Black Monday, from which Baker called then-NYSE Chairman John Phelan to urge him to drop his plan to shut down the New York Stock Exchange.
At the time, some conservatives were pushing for a constitutional convention to advance a balanced budget amendment, and Cox conducted research on the question. He represented the White House at hearings on the advisability of releasing John Hinckley from St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital following Hinckley&#x27;s attempted assassination of President Reagan, and led the vetting and research effort that resulted in Northwestern Law School Dean David Ruder being recommended to the president as SEC Chairman in 1987.

A former soccer player at USC, as a White House counsel Cox worked with the United States Soccer Federation on its proposal to bring the World Cup to the United States in 1994. “He was a key. Everybody in the damned government had their fingers in this,” said Eddie Mahe, who ran the U.S. Soccer Federation&#x27;s 1986 campaign to bring the event to the United States. “Without him, I don’t know that it would have survived.” According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, soccer&#x27;s governing body was requiring waivers of federal laws and regulations from virtually every agency of the federal government, and in &quot;record time, Cox prepared an executive order directing the agencies to fall in line. Reagan signed it.&quot; On July 5, 1988, the U.S. won the selection bid. In appreciation, the U.S. team presented Cox with the first jersey to be signed by all 22 members.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
Cox was elected to Congress in 1988 from what was then California&#x27;s 40th congressional district. He was re-elected eight more times from this Orange County-based district, which was renumbered as the 47th District in 1993 and the 48th District in 2003.

Early in his congressional career, Cox befriended two anti-Communists in Hungary and Lithuania who had been prisoners of conscience and who later became presidents of their countries after the end of Soviet domination. Cox met Árpád Göncz in 1989, and when Cox was later married, he spent part of his honeymoon in Hungary with then-President Göncz and his wife Mária Zsuzsanna Göntér. Cox met Dr. Vytautas Landsbergis, a professor at the Conservatory of Music in Vilnius, in 1989, well before the successful reestablishment of Lithuanian independence. The night Landsbergis was elected President of Lithuania, he embraced Cox on the tarmac at the airport in Vilnius after the Soviet Union had held Cox in East Berlin for a prolonged period. In May 1998, Cox was presented with the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas, the highest honor the Republic of Lithuania can give to a living noncitizen.
In 1989, Polish President Lech Wałęsa joined Cox in a Washington, DC ceremony marking the enactment of Cox&#x27;s legislation establishing the Polish-American Enterprise Fund. Together with the Baltic-American Enterprise Fund, the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund, and seven other enterprise funds in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Cox legislation, incorporated in the Support Eastern European Democracy (SEED) Act, matched U.S. foreign aid with venture capital in the newly free countries of the former Warsaw Pact. Cox has some fluency in the Russian language.

In 1994, Cox was appointed by President Clinton to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, which in 1995 published a unanimous report warning that the nation cannot continue to allow entitlement programs to consume a rapidly increasing share of the federal budget.

Among Cox&#x27;s notable legislative successes as a Representative was the Internet Tax Freedom Act, a 1998 law prohibiting federal, state, and local government taxation of Internet access and banning Internet-only levies such as email taxes, bit taxes, and bandwidth taxes. With U.S. Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) as his chief co-sponsor, Cox authored legislation in 1997 to privatize the National Helium Reserve, which was then $1.4 billion in debt to taxpayers. As of 2004, this was the third-largest privatization in U.S. history, surpassing the value of the 1988 Conrail privatization. Cox also wrote the only law that was enacted over President Bill Clinton&#x27;s veto, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, aimed at protecting investors from fraudulent and extortionate lawsuits.
For 10 of his 17 years in the Congress, from 1995 to 2005, Cox served in the House Majority Leadership as Chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, the fifth-ranking elected leadership position (behind the Speaker, the Majority Leader, the Majority Whip, and the Chair of the House Republican Conference). He was Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, and also Chairman of the Select Committee on U.S. National Security that produced the Cox Report, an indictment of Chinese espionage and of security failures at several U.S. national laboratories.

When Congress established the Bipartisan Study Group on Enhancing Multilateral Export Controls through federal legislation in 1999, Cox was tapped as co-chairman. The group published a unanimous report in 2001 recommending wholesale modernization of U.S. export controls. Cox also served as Chairman of the Select Committee on Homeland Security (the predecessor to the permanent House Committee); Chairman of the Task Force on Capital Markets; and Chairman of the Task Force on Budget Process Reform.

In the spring of 2001, then-Representative Cox was considered by President George W. Bush for a federal appellate judgeship on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Cox withdrew his name from consideration before a nomination could be made because one of his home state Democratic Senators, Barbara Boxer, objected to him due to his perceived conservatism. The seat that Cox had been considered for was eventually filled by Bush nominee Carlos Bea.

Cox was nominated by President George W. Bush to be the 28th chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 2, 2005, and unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on July 29, 2005. He was sworn in on August 3, 2005.

Shortly after becoming SEC Chairman, he was diagnosed with thymoma, a rare form of cancer, and underwent surgery in January 2006 to remove a tumor from his chest. He returned to work &quot;after several weeks recovering from surgery,&quot; according to The Associated Press. (The cancer returned 10 years later, but Cox was again given a clean bill of health after surgery and treatment.)

In May 2008, Cox delivered the Commencement Address at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. In April 2008, he received the University of Southern California&#x27;s highest award, the Asa V. Call Achievement Award, in a ceremony at the Los Angeles Millennium Biltmore Hotel.

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, enacted in July 2008, gave Cox one of five seats on the Federal Housing Finance Oversight Board, which advises the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency with respect to overall strategies and policies regarding the safety and soundness of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. In September 2008, the U.S. Congress passed and President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which placed Cox on the newly established Financial Stability Oversight Board to oversee the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program.

==== Regulatory initiatives ====
During his tenure, Cox led the Commission to implement new executive compensation rules. Since the early 1990s, support for reform had been growing, urged by the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board and others. Relying in part on FASB&#x27;s recommendations for improved presentation of compensation information, the Cox reforms made it possible for users of financial statements to readily understand how public company executives are compensated. Newly required information included the lump-sum cost of retirement benefits and explanations of why specific stock option grants were approved. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that the Commission &quot;largely stood its ground amid pressure from compensation specialists, investor advocates, and industry groups.&quot; With more than 20,000 comment letters, Cox said, &quot;No issue in the history of the SEC has generated such interest.&quot;

One of his first initiatives was launching a plain English effort, to eliminate legalese in investor communications in favor of clear language that let investors focus on what was important, the better to hold a company&#x27;s performance up to the light of day. Not only the executive compensation rules, but also disclosure rules for investment advisors and mutual funds—where more than half of U.S. households had their retirement and college savings—were subjected to the plain English requirements. Under Cox the SEC wrote new rules requiring the $10.6 trillion mutual fund industry to make their prospectuses easier for investors to read, understand, and access.

Cox defended the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act and resisted efforts to repeal it or scale it back legislatively. The greatest source of complaint about the law during his tenure was its Section 404, which produced compliance expenses far higher than the SEC under his predecessor had predicted. Working with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC under Cox replaced the original auditing standard for Section 404 with a streamlined, more cost-effective version, and also provided new guidance for management intended to reduce unnecessary costs. At Cox&#x27;s direction the agency undertook a nationwide Small Business Cost-Benefit Study to determine whether, as intended, the new auditing standard and management guidance had made compliance less expensive and better focused the 404 process on control elements that truly matter for companies of all sizes.

In June 2007 the Commission voted unanimously to repeal the so-called &quot;uptick rule&quot; or &quot;tick test.&quot; The action was not controversial at the time: it was taken after an extensive multi-year study by the Office of Economic Analysis, begun in 2003 under Chairman Bill Donaldson. The study found that the rule—which had never applied on NASDAQ or to ECNs and other trading systems—had been rendered ineffective on the NYSE due to decimalization (that is, the reduction of the &quot;tick&quot; increment to a penny, as compared to the 1/8 or 12½¢ that was in effect when the rule was adopted in 1938). Its repeal later became the subject of much debate, with some advocating its reinstatement. On July 15, 2008, Cox told a U.S. House hearing that the Commission was studying the potential institution of &quot;a price test that could work with an increment of a nickel or dime&quot; or some more meaningful amount.

==== Technological modernization ====
Technological modernization of the SEC was a Cox priority throughout his tenure. He introduced new technology for investor disclosure, compliance analytics, nationwide investigative work sharing, and management of funds recovered for investors. In August 2008 he rolled out the future replacement of the SEC&#x27;s forms-based disclosure database, called EDGAR, with a new interactive disclosure system using computer-tagged data in the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL). The new system was designed to let future investors easily search, sort, and recombine information to generate reports and analysis from hundreds of thousands of companies and millions of forms. Under Cox the SEC oversaw the creation of a taxonomy of over 11,000 XBRL data tags that catalog every element of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In 2008 the Commission issued rules requiring all publicly traded companies and mutual funds in the United States to tag their financial information.

Another Cox technology initiative liberalized the proxy rules to allow investors and companies to use Electronic Shareholder Forums—virtual meeting places on the Internet to promote shareholder initiatives, conduct straw polls, apprise a company&#x27;s directors of critical shareholder concerns, and inform shareholders of management&#x27;s and directors&#x27; views.

In 2006 the SEC launched a war against Internet financial spam, shutting down trading in companies that touted their stock by clogging investors’ in-boxes. Investor complaints about the practice fell from more than 220,000 per month in December 2006 to 70,000 per month in February 2007; Internet software and services company Symantec credited the SEC with cutting financial spam by 30 percent.

These technological initiatives were widely supported, with one observer noting that Cox &quot;earned virtually universal plaudits for efforts to modernize technology, transparency, and understandability of corporate reports, and to provide for apples-to-apples comparisons (for the first time ever) of corporate executive compensation.&quot;

==== Individual investors and seniors ====
The particular needs of senior investors, whose ranks are growing rapidly, was a special Cox focus. In April 2006, the SEC held its first “Seniors Summit”, working with AARP, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the North American Securities Administrators Association, and several state regulators; the conferences are now held annually. A nationwide sweep examination conducted by the SEC and authorities in seven states found that &quot;free lunch&quot; investment seminars, which draw large numbers of retirees, routinely involved significant fraud. Many were advised to put their retirement funds into equity-indexed annuities, where they could get stock market returns while keeping their money “safe”. But neither these investments, nor the sales agents, were registered with state or federal securities regulators—and investors were frequently unaware that it would be impossible to get their money back for as much as 15 years without paying a stiff penalty. The SEC enacted rules in 2008 to protect seniors and other investors from fraudulent and abusive practices in annuities sales.

==== International integration ====
During Cox&#x27;s tenure the SEC significantly expanded its international activity. Between 2005 and 2008, Cox signed supervisory arrangements covering enforcement and regulatory cooperation with regulators in the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Australia, Germany, Bulgaria, and Norway. As Chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions&#x27; Technical Committee, he led international efforts to converge U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. In December 2007, the SEC adopted rules to permit foreign issuers to use IFRS without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. And in November 2008, the
SEC issued a roadmap – with clear milestones along the way — that would lead to a Commission decision as early as 2014 on whether or not U.S. public companies should be required to use IFRS. Cox also initiated a mutual recognition process for foreign regulators, based on an assessment of whether the securities regulatory system in another country produces comparably high-quality results for investors, including in the area of enforcement. In August 2008 he executed an arrangement with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission under which the SEC could approve exemptions allowing Australian-registered securities exchanges to operate in the U.S. without having also to register with the SEC, and U.S. exchanges would have the same privilege in Australia. As of 2008, the SEC was in mutual recognition discussions with regulators in Canada, and also in preliminary discussions with the Committee of European Securities Regulators.

==== Law enforcement ====
International enforcement also stepped up considerably under Cox. In 2008, the SEC made 556 requests of foreign regulators for assistance with SEC investigations, many of which were connected to potential wrongdoing in the subprime market. Among the significant international cases the Commission brought during this period were the highly publicized 2008 charges against Hong Kong-based insider trading in Dow Jones prior to its acquisition by News Corporation. Under Cox the SEC also brought the largest number of cases in its history charging corporations and their officers with foreign bribery under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and imposed record penalties for these cases.

Overall, enforcement was Cox&#x27;s stated priority beginning in 2005 and throughout his chairmanship. He moved quickly to settle the debate over whether it was legitimate to impose penalties on corporations, adopting a policy that made clear the SEC &quot;isn&#x27;t turning out to be the corporate-friendly place that many in the boardroom set were hoping for.&quot; Within the SEC budget, as of 2008, he had increased the share devoted to enforcement to its highest level in 20 years. Nonetheless, the SEC&#x27;s overall appropriation was held steady during two of his budget years, first by a Republican and then a Democratic Congress, and it was increased by only 2% in a third year. These sub-inflation agency budgets, combined with merit pay increases for staff, caused the total enforcement personnel to decline. Critics attacked the underfunding of the SEC and blamed Cox, though Congress and the administration clearly shared the responsibility. When the agency budget was finally increased in fiscal 2008, he increased enforcement personnel by 4%.

Beginning early in his chairmanship he focused the agency&#x27;s enforcement efforts on stock option backdating, an illicit practice that had been exposed after the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act changed the rules regarding the reporting of stock option grants. Under Cox the SEC investigated more than 160 stock option backdating cases, aided by the fact that the reporting forms for stock option disclosure were among the first to be mandated in “interactive data” format. Some of these cases were noteworthy for their size: in December 2007 the agency won $468 million in a settlement for stock option backdating against the former chairman and CEO of UnitedHealth Group.

Cox also aggressively used the agency&#x27;s “Fair Funds” authority to distribute funds recovered from securities law violators directly to injured investors. By February 2008 the SEC had returned more than $3.5 billion to wronged investors, including more than $2 billion in 2007 alone. To expedite the return of the funds, cut red tape and lower costs, Cox created a new Office of Collections and Distributions. A few weeks later, in May 2008, the new Office began sending more than $800 million in Fair Funds to harmed investors in American International Group, Inc. (AIG), which settled SEC charges of financial fraud. In 2006 the Commission obtained a $350 million penalty from Fannie Mae after accusing it of accounting fraud; the penalty was one of the largest in Commission history. The following year the Commission charged Freddie Mac with accounting fraud and recovered a $50 million penalty.

As the 2008 credit crunch spread to municipal finance, the auction rate securities market froze, leaving investors without access to their cash. The SEC immediately investigated the largest firms in the market and entered into settlements that were the largest in the history of the SEC, amounting to up to $30 billion to injured
investors.

Cox also targeted municipal securities fraud. In April 2008 the SEC charged five former San Diego city officials with securities fraud involving billions in undisclosed pension liabilities that had placed the city and taxpayers in serious financial jeopardy. Throughout his chairmanship he railed against the inadequacy of disclosure to investors in municipal securities, which the SEC does not regulate, and asked Congress for explicit authority for the agency to do so. In December 2008, the SEC under his leadership authorized the creation of a free, Internet-accessible repository for municipal finance disclosure. &quot;With liquidity problems of municipal auction rate securities and rating downgrades of municipal bond insurers contributing to the current credit crisis, the disclosure and transparency of the municipal markets have never been more critical,&quot; he said.

In late December 2008, following the confession by New York investment advisor Bernard Madoff and the filing of SEC charges against him alleging a $50 billion fraud, Cox stated that he was &quot;gravely concerned&quot; that &quot;specific and credible evidence&quot; provided to the agency over a period of at least 10 years had not previously been referred to the Commission for commencement of a formal investigation. He ordered an internal investigation by the agency&#x27;s Inspector General. The report found that substantive allegations concerning Madoff were first brought to the SEC in 1992.

==== Response to the beginning of the 2008 U.S. recession ====
Under his leadership, the SEC on September 17 and 18, 2008, imposed a variety of both permanent and emergency restrictions on short selling in response to the liquidity crisis. Abusive naked short selling, in which the seller intentionally fails to deliver the shares sold short in time for settlement, was banned outright, an exception for options market makers that had been in place for several years was eliminated, and a new anti-fraud provision, Rule 10b-21, was adopted to give specific enforcement authority in such cases. In September 2008, short selling of 799 financial stocks was temporarily curtailed in response to rumors accompanied by heightened short selling activity in the shares of major financial institutions.

On September 26, 2008, Cox ended the 2004 program for voluntary regulation of investment bank holding companies, begun under SEC Chairman William Donaldson and then-Director of Market Regulation (later SEC Commissioner) Annette Nazareth. The program &quot;was fundamentally flawed from the beginning, because investment banks could opt in or out of supervision voluntarily,&quot; Cox said. A critical report by the SEC inspector general that evaluated the program in light of the Bear Stearns near-failure in March 2008 found that while &quot;Bear Stearns was compliant with the capital and liquidity requirements&quot; at the time of its acquisition, &quot;its collapse raises serious questions about the adequacy of these requirements.&quot; However, according to the Inspector General, his report &quot;did not include a determination of the cause of Bear Stearns&#x27; collapse&quot; or determine &quot;whether any of these issues directly contributed to Bear Stearns&#x27; collapse.&quot; On that subject, the report stated, &quot;we have no evidence linking these significant deficiencies with the cause of Bear Stearns&#x27; collapse.&quot; Cox criticized the oversight program on the ground that because of its voluntary nature and the SEC&#x27;s limited statutory authority, the agency could not force changes in the hundreds of unregulated subsidiaries of large investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns as bank regulators could do with bank holding companies. In testimony before Congress on several occasions in 2008, he asked for statutory authority to regulate investment bank holding companies.

In addition to the fact that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act did not give the SEC the authority to regulate large investment bank holding companies, Cox noted that investors were vulnerable to other regulatory gaps such as the fact that the $60 trillion market for credit default swaps was then completely unregulated. &quot;Neither the SEC nor any regulator has authority even to require minimum disclosure&quot;, he said. In testimony and public statements he urged Congress to enact remedial legislation.

Cox said that during the buildup of the credit crisis, when the credit rating agencies were still unregulated, they gave top credit ratings to financial instruments which packaged risky loans and spread the negative impacts of the credit crisis more broadly throughout the markets. Following the first-time SEC registration of the credit rating agencies in September 2007 under newly enacted legislative authority, he ordered a 10-month examination of the three major rating agencies that uncovered significant weaknesses in their ratings practices for mortgage-backed securities and that called into question the impartiality of their ratings. The results were reported to Congress in July 2008. The SEC immediately commenced a rulemaking which concluded on December 3, 2008, with approval of a series of measures to regulate the conflicts of interests, disclosures, internal policies, and business practices of credit rating agencies. The regulations were intended to ensure that firms provide more meaningful ratings and greater disclosure to investors concerning collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities.

In an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in late December 2008, Cox said, &quot;What we have done in this current turmoil is stay calm, which has been our greatest contribution—not being impulsive, not changing the rules willy-nilly, but going through a very professional and orderly process that takes into account unintended consequences and gives ample notice to market participants.&quot; Cox added that the Commission&#x27;s decision to impose a three-week ban on short selling of financial company stocks was taken reluctantly, but that the view at the time, including from Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, was that &quot;if we did not act and act at that instant, these financial institutions could fail as a result and there would be nothing left to save.&quot; In a December 2008 interview with Reuters, he explained that the SEC&#x27;s Office of Economic Analysis was still evaluating data from the temporary ban, and that preliminary findings pointed to several unintended market consequences and side effects. &quot;While the actual effects of this temporary action will not be fully understood for many more months, if not years ... knowing what we know now, I believe on balance the Commission would not do it again.&quot;

Cox stepped down as Chairman of the SEC at the end of the Bush administration, on January 20, 2009.

=== Later career ===
Following his tenure at the SEC, Cox returned to his home in Southern California and the practice of law, which had been his pre-Washington profession. He joined the Boston-based international law firm of Bingham McCutchen LLP as a partner in the firm&#x27;s Corporate, M&amp;A and Securities practice, resident in its Orange County office, where in 2014 The Best Lawyers in America named him Lawyer of the Year in the Corporate Governance category. He also served as president of Bingham Consulting LLC, the firm&#x27;s global strategic consulting business. Following the November 2014 combination of Bingham and the Philadelphia-based international law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, Cox became a partner of Morgan Lewis and president of Morgan Lewis Consulting LLC. Other recent members of Morgan Lewis Consulting include former Arizona Diamondbacks and San Diego Padres owner Jeff Moorad, former National Labor Relations Board chairman Philip Miscimarra, former New Hampshire Governor Steve Merrill, former California Governor and U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, former Clinton White House Cabinet Secretary Thurgood Marshall Jr., and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and George Bush Presidential Library Executive Director Roman Popadiuk. While at Morgan Lewis, Cox was again named by The Best Lawyers in America as Lawyer of the Year in Orange County, this time in the Corporate Law category for 2016. In February 2020, Cox retired as a partner of Morgan Lewis and as president of Morgan Lewis Consulting, taking the title of counsel at the law firm.

Cox is a member of the board of directors of Revitate, an investor in real estate, sports, and consumer products, and of NetChoice, an internet industry association.
He is a life trustee of the University of Southern California and a member of the advisory boards of New York-based Blue Flame AI and the Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute, founded by Nobel Prize winner George A. Olah. He serves as Chair of the Rhodes Scholarship selection committee for Southern California, and is a Senior Scholar in Residence at the University of California, Irvine. He formerly served on the boards of directors of photonics manufacturer Newport Corporation, governance, risk, and compliance firm ACA Group, and health care companies RxSight, Inc., Alphaeon Corporation, and Calhoun Vision, Inc., as well as the advisory boards of private equity firm Starr Investment Holdings, RevOZ Capital, the United States Energy Security Council, and governance, risk, and compliance firm Thomson Reuters Accelus. He is a member of the board of directors of the Forum for Corporate Directors and a past chair. For ten years, he was a member of the board of directors of the National Endowment for Democracy, and of the board of trustees of Chapman University.

The Forum for Corporate Directors honored Cox as a &quot;Director of the Year&quot; in March 2019 in the category of Corporate Governance. In June 2014, Cox was named a &quot;Father of the Year&quot; by the Father&#x27;s Day Council and the American Diabetes Association in recognition of his &quot;outstanding contributions to his family, profession and community.&quot;

<text>Reverb is a weekly HBO music television series spotlighting emerging talent that ran for four seasons (1997–2001). &quot;Reverb&quot; captured the energy and spontaneity of live music by taking viewers on stage, backstage, and into the audience at some of the premier venues in the United States. Joining artists on tour, without special staging or second takes, &quot;Reverb&quot; created an unfiltered, authentic and intimate experience where the viewer became part of the live show dynamic between artist and fan. During its run, the show became the highest-rated, regularly scheduled music program on television. A joint effort of HBO and Warner Music Group, &quot;Reverb&quot; featured a wide variety of artists from major and independent record labels. Vanity Fair magazine called the show &quot;a brilliant showcase of underground favorites.&quot;

The series creators were Jim Noonan, Chris Spencer and Will Tanous. Noonan served as Executive Producer (Season 1–3) and Tanous served as a Producer (Seasons 1-3) and Executive Producer (Season 4). Directors for the series included Milton Lage and Linda Mendoza. Respected music producer and engineer, Mr. Colson of Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin served as the series&#x27; primary music mixer. &quot;Reverb&quot; was also critical in the launch of the career of comedian Fred Armisen, who was featured as a special correspondent. Comedian and musician Dave Hill served as a writer on the show. He also composed and performed the show&#x27;s theme song.

In June 1961, after pulling into the bus station in Jackson, Mississippi, as a Freedom Rider, Filner was arrested for &quot;disturbing the peace and inciting a riot.&quot; He refused to post bond for his release and remained incarcerated for two months.

He graduated from Cornell in 1963 with a degree in chemistry, and earned his doctorate in history of science from Cornell six years later. 

==Career==
While completing his PhD, he moved to San Diego, becoming a history professor at San Diego State University for more than 20 years.

Filner worked for U.S. Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota in 1975 and for Minnesota congressman Don Fraser in 1976. He also worked for Congressman Jim Bates from the San Diego area in 1984.

His elective career began in 1979, when his opposition to the closing of a neighborhood school led him to run for the San Diego Unified School District Board of Education, defeating a longtime incumbent. His &quot;back to basics&quot; approach to education won him wide praise, and his colleagues elected him president of the board in 1982. He was elected to the San Diego City Council in 1987 and was reelected in 1991; his colleagues elected him deputy mayor of San Diego.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
====Elections====
California gained seven seats after the 1990 census, and one of them was the 50th District in south San Diego (renumbered the 51st District after the 2000 census). The district is one of the most ethnically diverse in the nation, including much of San Diego&#x27;s southern section, the cities of Chula Vista and National City and all of Imperial County. It includes most of California&#x27;s border with Mexico, except for the city of Imperial Beach. In 1992, Filner ran in a five-way Democratic primary for the seat and won a narrow victory. One of his primary opponents was his former boss, Jim Bates, who had lost his seat in a sexual harassment scandal in 1990 and whose home had been drawn into the district.

Another opponent was veteran state Senator Wadie Deddeh, who was term-limited. Filner defeated Deddeh by a narrow margin, with Bates finishing third place in the primary. The district was almost 40% Hispanic (redistricting in 2000 made it 53% Hispanic) and heavily Democratic, and his victory in November (with 57 percent of the vote) was a foregone conclusion. He was reelected nine times with no substantive Republican opposition. He ran unopposed in 1998. He chose not to run for re-election to Congress in 2012, opting instead to run for mayor of San Diego. He resigned from the House of Representatives on December 3, 2012, in order to take office as Mayor of San Diego.

Filner had a bitter rivalry with Juan Vargas, another Democratic politician who ran against Filner in the Democratic primary three times. Filner and Vargas accused each other of corruption. However, in the 2012 mayoral race, Vargas endorsed Filner for Mayor of San Diego and Vargas was elected to Filner&#x27;s seat in Congress.

===Tenure===
Filner was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He was also a member of the Congressional Motorcycle Safety Caucus and International Conservation Caucus. He was one of the 31 House Democrats who voted to not count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election, despite Republican President George Bush winning the state by 118,457 votes. In 2008, Filner sponsored a resolution, passed by the House of Representatives, in support of National Aviation Maintenance Technician Day. While in congress, Filner was known for his combative personality, and for personally dealing with constituent issues.

;Veterans issues
Filner served on the House Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs and ascended to the chairmanship when the Democrats took over the House of Representatives after the 2006 election. As chairman, Filner advocated for funding for veterans benefits, increased spending on veterans healthcare, and a new GI bill for veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. Filner stayed on as ranking Democrat on the committee after the Republicans retook the House in the 2010 election.

;Filipino issues
Filner&#x27;s district in south San Diego had one of the largest populations of Filipino Americans in the country, leading Filner to focus on issues relevant to the Philippines while in congress, especially Filipino veterans. Filner&#x27;s accomplishments included legislation allowing Filipino veterans to maintain a small stipend from the government if they moved back to the Philippines, burial benefits, and access to VA clinics. In 2009 Filner brokered a deal securing $198 million in pension benefits for Filipino veterans who had served for the United States in World War II in the form of a $15,000 lump sum payment as part of the 2009 stimulus bill. In February 2009, Rep. Antonio Diaz filed a bill in the Philippine House of Representatives seeking to confer honorary Filipino citizenship on Filner and U.S. Senators Daniel Inouye, Daniel Akaka, and Ted Stevens for their role in securing the passage of this legislation.

;Airline worker controversy
On August 20, 2007, Filner was involved in an altercation with a United Airlines employee at Dulles International Airport after he became upset that his baggage had not yet arrived on a baggage carousel. Filner entered the baggage claim office and became irritated when the employee was busy helping another customer and asked the congressman to wait his turn. It was at this point that it is alleged that Filner attempted to enter the employee-only area of the office. He was asked to leave the area several times by airline employees but refused to do so until airport police were called in.

Filner was on his way to visit troops in Iraq at the time of the incident. He released a statement saying &quot;suffice it to say now, that the story that has appeared in the press is factually incorrect and the charges are ridiculous&quot;. He was later charged with assault and battery. Filner pleaded guilty in an Alford plea to reduced charges of trespassing. The House Ethics Committee began a probe into the event, but it was later dropped.

;People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran
Filner, along with several senior United States officials, argued that the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran, also known as the MEK, should have its designation as a terrorist group removed. Filner considered the MEK, a major member of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, an ally against the current Iranian regime. The U.S. Department of State lifted the MEK&#x27;s designation as a terrorist organization as of September 28, 2012.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
**Subcommittee on Aviation
**Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
**Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment
*Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs (Ranking Member)

===Mayor of San Diego===
====Election====

Filner announced on June 8, 2011, that he would be a candidate for mayor of San Diego in the 2012 election and would not run for re-election to Congress. In the primary on June 5, 2012, he placed second with 30.7% of the vote. He faced city councilmember Carl DeMaio in the November 2012 runoff election. Filner defeated DeMaio, 52.5% to 47.5%. Filner, age 70, won as San Diego&#x27;s first elected Democratic mayor since 1992 and only its second since 1971.

===Tenure===
In his first speech as mayor, Filner promised to focus on rebuilding the neighborhoods of San Diego, improving city services, increasing staffing for public safety, bringing jobs to the city, and developing stronger regional ties with Tijuana.

In January 2013, following a meeting between Filner and the San Diego chapter of Americans for Safe Access, Filner instructed the San Diego Police Department and city code compliance officers to stop enforcing codes against marijuana dispensaries and stop forwarding cases to the San Diego City Attorney&#x27;s Office. In April 2013, Filner proposed a new ordinance to restore permanent legal status to dispensaries, but the City Council rejected it and suggested that the City Attorney draft a new ordinance in its place. Meanwhile, federal agencies continued to raid and prosecute dispensaries within city limits.

In February 2013, Filner raised controversy by not authorizing funding of the Tourism Marketing District, a hotelier-run organization charged with promoting San Diego as a tourist destination that is funded by a 2 percent surcharge on hotel rooms. In 2012, the San Diego City Council agreed to renew the District for 39 1/2 years, but outgoing mayor Jerry Sanders did not sign the agreement before leaving office. Filner publicly withheld his signature on the agreement, wanting a series of concessions that would raise hotel worker salaries, protect the City from liability, and direct more of the funds collected to be used by the City of San Diego. The District subsequently filed suit against the Mayor to enforce the agreement, but Judge Timothy Taylor ruled that Filner had the discretion not to sign. After this ruling, Filner and the hoteliers agreed to a compromise and Filner signed the contract. However, in late May 2013 Filner temporarily withheld payments to the District until it agreed to provide upfront funding for a centennial celebration for Balboa Park.

===2013 allegations and resignation===
====Allegations of sexual harassment====
On July 11, 2013, three of Filner&#x27;s long-time supporters held a press conference to call for Filner&#x27;s resignation as mayor, based on numerous unspecified but &quot;credible&quot; allegations that he had sexually harassed women. KPBS-FM said that it had been investigating reports of sexual harassment of female staff members for several months, and that the complaints included &quot;inappropriate comments, kissing and groping&quot;. Later that day Filner issued a video statement apologizing and saying that he was seeking professional help to change his behavior. The next day Filner told reporters that he had treated women poorly and sometimes intimidated them, but insisted that a &quot;fair and independent investigation&quot; would clear him of sexual harassment charges.

On July 12, Filner&#x27;s chief of staff, Vince Hall, announced his resignation, effective immediately. On July 24, Filner&#x27;s new chief of staff Tony Buckles, his former congressional chief of staff, resigned after only 10 days on the job and was replaced by Lee Burdick, a woman who had been serving as deputy chief of staff.

On July 15, the same three former supporters held another press conference, describing in more detail charges by women who said they had been forcibly kissed, groped, and subjected to sexually suggestive comments by Filner; the alleged but unidentified victims include a mayoral staffer, a campaign volunteer and a constituent. Filner repeated that he had done nothing wrong and would not resign.

On July 22, 2013, attorney Gloria Allred announced at a press conference that her firm had filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Filner on behalf of the mayor&#x27;s former communications director. By August 26, 19 women had publicly claimed that Filner had sexually harassed them, including a retired admiral, a Marilyn Monroe impersonator who appeared at one of his fundraisers, a 67-year-old great-grandmother who worked for the city, a nurse who said Filner demanded a date in exchange for helping a Marine who had suffered a brain injury and PTSD during service in Iraq, and several female members of the U.S. armed forces who had been raped during their service. In the last two instances, Filner&#x27;s contact with the women stemmed from his position at the time as ranking member of the House Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee.

In the ensuing weeks, calls for Filner&#x27;s resignation came from Democratic U.S. senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, representatives Susan Davis and Scott Peters, DNC chairwoman and U.S Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, California State Assembly members Toni Atkins and Lorena Gonzalez, Nancy Pelosi, and all nine members of the City Council.

On July 26, 2013, Filner announced that he planned to take a leave of absence &quot;to undergo two weeks of intensive therapy” starting August 5. He started the treatment but ended it early on August 10, according to his attorney.

On July 29, 2013, Filner asked the city of San Diego to pay his legal fees for a sexual harassment lawsuit regarding his former communications director. The city council voted not to do so, and in fact to sue Filner for any costs incurred by the city due to claims filed against him and the city. The City Council later reversed itself as part of a negotiated agreement with Filner.

===Other issues===
Federal, state and local investigators looked into several other issues involving Filner. One matter involved a trip he took to Paris with his then-fiancée in June 2013; questions had been raised about the nonprofit group that paid his expenses and the use of city credit cards to pay for his accompanying security detail. On another issue, FBI agents looked into a pair of proposed housing developments which Filner blocked with an &quot;administrative hold&quot; until the developers contributed money to certain city projects.

===Recall effort===
In August 2013 two different groups started the process to mount a recall drive against Filner; the two groups later combined their efforts. In order to force a recall election, they would have had to gather more than 100,000 signatures of city voters (15% of the votes cast in the most recent election) within a 39-day window. On August 18, 1,200 volunteers began collecting signatures. Less than a week after the signature drive began, Filner agreed to resign. The recall organizers wound down the effort, called for all petitions to be turned in so they could be counted and destroyed, and worked on preparing a final financial accounting.

===Resignation===
On August 21, 2013, city attorney Jan Goldsmith said that Filner had reached an agreement with the city after three days of mediation. The City Council considered the agreement in a closed session on August 23 and voted 7-0 to accept Filner&#x27;s resignation. The resignation deal with the City Council limits Filner&#x27;s &quot;legal and financial exposure&quot; by providing a joint legal defense for him and the city for claims filed against him by current or former city employees, as well as paying up to $98,000 of his outside legal fees. Filner signed a letter of resignation that became effective at 5 p.m PDT August 30, 2013. City Council president Todd Gloria served as interim mayor, with limited powers, pending election of a new mayor. A special election was held on November 19, 2013; since no candidate received a majority of the vote, a runoff election was held on February 11, 2014, wherein Kevin Faulconer was elected to be the next mayor.

===Conviction===
On October 15, 2013, Filner pleaded guilty in San Diego Superior Court to three criminal counts filed against him by the California state attorney general, who took over the case after the San Diego County district attorney recused herself. The charges were one felony count of false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery charges. The victims were identified as three Jane Does. He could have faced up to five years in prison, but a plea bargain was reportedly reached, under which he would be given three months of house arrest, three years probation, and partial loss of his mayoral pension. On December 9, 2013, the terms of the plea bargain were imposed at a sentencing hearing. The plea bargain would have prohibited him from ever seeking or holding public office again, but the judge reduced the prohibition so it applies only while he is on probation. He served a three-month term of house arrest which ended on April 6, 2014.

In a 2016 interview, Filner denied all allegations of sexual harassment.

=== Additional allegation in 2017 ===
On November 20, 2017, Representative Diana DeGette (D-Colorado) alleged during an interview on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press Daily&quot; that Filner tried to force himself on her in an elevator.

==Personal life==
Filner is divorced from his first wife, Barbara (Christy) Filner, a retired mediation specialist whom he met when they both taught in a summer program in the early 1960s at Tuskegee University (then Institute). They have two adult children, a son and a daughter.

Filner was later married to Jane Merrill, but they divorced in 2011.

At his first news conference after his election as mayor in 2012, Filner introduced his fiancée, Bronwyn Ingram, a disability analyst who worked for the Social Security Administration. On July 8, 2013, Ingram announced by email to a group of her supporters that the engagement had been called off and the relationship was over. In a subsequent statement, Ingram cited Filner&#x27;s verbal abuse and blatant sexting as reasons for the split.

<text>Duncan Lee Hunter (born May 31, 1948) is an American politician. He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California&#x27;s 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009.

Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses.

He was succeeded as representative for the 52nd district by his son, Duncan D. Hunter.

==Early life, education, military service, and family==
Hunter was born in Riverside, California, the son of Lola Lee (née Young) (d. 2004) and Robert Olin Hunter (1915–2006). He graduated from Rubidoux High School in Riverside in 1966. He attended the University of Montana from 1966 to 1967, and then briefly the University of California, Santa Barbara, before being commissioned into the United States Army in 1969.

He served in South Vietnam from 1970 to 1971 during the Vietnam War in the Army Rangers&#x27; 75th Infantry Regiment, attached to the 173rd Airborne Brigade. He participated in 24 helicopter assaults as well as in a number of night-time reconnaissance patrols. He held the rank of first lieutenant, and was awarded the Bronze Star, Air Medal, and service ribbons such as the Vietnam Service Medal. He has said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything special in the U.S. Army, but I served with very special soldiers I will never forget.&quot;

Making use of the G.I. Bill in 1973, he enrolled at the San Diego campus of the Western State University College of Law (now Thomas Jefferson School of Law) and earned a Bachelor of Science in Law and Juris Doctor in 1976. Hunter worked farming and construction jobs to supplement his income while finishing his degree. He was admitted to the State Bar of California on December 22, 1976, but has held inactive status since January 1, 1983.

Hunter married Lynne Layh in 1973. Hunter&#x27;s son, Duncan Duane Hunter (born 1976), a major in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and 2004 and Afghanistan in 2007. On November 4, 2008, Duncan D. Hunter was elected to succeed his father as the congressional representative of the California&#x27;s 52nd congressional district. On August 21, 2018, Duncan D. Hunter and his wife Margaret, were indicted for criminal activity. In June 2019, federal prosecutors showed that from 2009 to 2016, Hunter had spent campaign funds on extramarital affairs with five women, including lobbyists and congressional staff. In December 2019, Hunter changed his plea to guilty on one count of misusing campaign funds. On March 17, 2020, Hunter was sentenced by the U.S. District Court Southern District of California to 11 months in prison.

Hunter&#x27;s family attends First Baptist Church of Alpine, which is affiliated with the San Diego Southern Baptist Association. Hunter&#x27;s Alpine, California home burned down during the October 2003 Cedar Fire. The loss was over $500,000, but insurance covered most of it. Hunter was critical of Governor Gray Davis&#x27;s response to the fire.

Hunter has another son, Samuel. He has a brother, John Hunter, who has worked as a weapons scientist.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Initial election and re-elections===

In 1980, Hunter was recruited to run for Congress in what was then the 42nd District against 18-year incumbent Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin. Hunter was initially an underdog in a district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 2 to 1. However, his attacks on Van Deerlin&#x27;s record on national defense gained traction in a district dominated by military bases and personnel. Van Deerlin did not respond quickly enough, and Hunter narrowly defeated him. He was one of many Republicans swept into office from historically Democratic districts as a result of the &quot;Reagan revolution&quot;; Van Deerlin had been the district&#x27;s only congressman since its creation in 1963.

After the 1980 census, many of the more Democratic areas were cut out of Hunter&#x27;s district, and he was reelected 13 more times with no substantive opposition. During this time, he only won less than 60 percent of the vote once, when he was held to 53.8 percent in 1992. His district was renumbered as the 45th District in 1983 and the 52nd in 1993.

In the 2006 general election, he defeated Navy veteran/minister John Rinaldi, a Democrat, and Michael Benoit, a Libertarian. Hunter was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote, a 33-point margin over Rinaldi.

On March 20, 2007, Hunter announced that, as part of his presidential bid, he would not seek a 15th term in the House of Representatives in 2008. After his son, Duncan D. Hunter, announced his candidacy for his father&#x27;s seat, the younger Hunter was recalled by the United States Marine Corps to serve in the Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan. During Duncan D. Hunter&#x27;s active service, his wife, Margaret Hunter, campaigned on his behalf. On June 3, 2008, Duncan D. Hunter won 72% of the Republican Primary vote and became the Republican nominee to replace his father representing the 52nd District.

===House Armed Services Committee===
Hunter became chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in 2002. As such, he sponsored legislation authorizing defense department fiscal year activities from FY2004 to FY2007. During consideration of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act, Hunter offered an amendment to the bill clarifying enacted policy restricting women from direct combat units. Hunter&#x27;s amendment codified existing Army policy enacted in 1994 under former Defense Secretary Les Aspin that prohibited women from submitting or migrating into combat units or operations. The amendment was subsequently withdrawn in order for a study to be conducted on the rationale and future implementation of the policy.

In November 2004, Hunter and Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner withheld their support for a bill creating a Director of National Intelligence (DNI) until specific conditions were met. Hunter argued that the military is the biggest consumer of intelligence and any reforms enacted, including the creation of a DNI, must not endanger the lives of troops on the battlefield. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which created the DNI position, was passed by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush later that year.

In a House Armed Services Committee hearing on November 9, 2005, Hunter strongly criticized a Defense Logistics Agency &quot;prime vendor&quot; buying program that led to the purchase of $20 ice cube trays and a tiny refrigerator for $22,797 (initially exposed by &quot;The State&quot;). Hunter stated that he wanted explanations from the companies in question and the government purchasing agents who had approved the purchases, accusing the latter of &quot;absolute incompetence.&quot; He further stated that the purchases are &quot;a real slap in the face to the guy making $13,000 a year who is engaged in a firefight in Ramadi,&quot; and claimed that &quot;A fairly large amount of incompetence is embedded into the system.&quot;

On November 18, 2005, in response to Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha&#x27;s resolution to terminate the deployment of United States forces in Iraq, to redeploy the forces already involved in Iraq, and to &quot;pursue security and stability in Iraq through diplomacy&quot;, Hunter and other Republicans drafted a two-sentence counter-resolution that read:

:Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the deployment of United States forces in Iraq be terminated immediately.

:Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the deployment of United States forces in Iraq be terminated immediately.

Democrats condemned the bill as a political stunt; they made much of the fact that Hunter himself didn&#x27;t support his own resolution. The bill was defeated, 3–403, in the House of Representatives.

Hunter became ranking member of the committee when Democrats took control of the House in 2007.

On January 31, 2007, Hunter held a press conference on the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test, stating that it &quot;represents the commencement of a new era of military competition in space.&quot; He contended that the United States&#x27; ability to engage in warfare depends heavily on its space assets, and opined that the country must take steps to &quot;ensure our forces cannot be targeted through an adversarial space strike.&quot;

On April 25, 2007, after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared &quot;the war is lost&quot;, Hunter wrote &quot;my highest obligation is, like yours, owed to our forces in uniform, especially during this time of war... Given your position of leadership within the United States Government, I find your pronouncement of failure irresponsible and disserving to America&#x27;s armed forces. In light of the fact that this statement has both been used by our adversaries and has exhibited a marked lack of leadership to U.S. troops, I call on you to resign your leadership position&quot;. Hunter further wrote that Reid&#x27;s declaration &quot;can have no effect but to demoralize the brave men and women, who are honorably fulfilling their mission in Iraq, and to encourage our adversaries... Even if you sincerely believe it to be true, your pronouncement of failure will undoubtedly be used by terrorist leaders to rally their followers – inevitably leading to increased attacks on U.S. and coalition forces&quot;.

According to the July 2007 edition of &quot;Pacific Flyer&quot;, Hunter and Cunningham had pressured the Department of Defense to &quot;...advise DARPA to put an immediate halt to bureaucratic delays and get on with the DuPont Aerospace DP-2 testing.&quot; The DP-2 is a Vertical Take-Off and Landing, or VTOL, aircraft designed by DuPont Aerospace to transport special operations forces, but has been repeatedly rejected by the United States Navy, United States Army, United States Air Force, NASA, and DARPA. The design, of which all four constructed models have crashed, has had $63 million appropriated to it since 1991, not including a suggested $6 million for fiscal year 2008. Despite the rejections and reports by multiple military and civilian experts that the aircraft will not fly or hover and will incinerate Special Operations forces rappelling out of the aircraft, Hunter has allegedly repeatedly added funding for the DP-2 in &quot;earmarks&quot; and defended the aircraft in recent testimony to the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the Committee on Science and Technology. Hunter received $36,000 in donations from DuPont Aerospace.
According to his testimony before Congress,
Hunter compared the lack of success of the DP-2 to the trials of perfecting the V-22 Osprey. He alleged that such long-term testing is necessary to keep American forces equipped with the best technology.

In April 2023 NPR reported on a &quot;friendly fire&quot; mortar incident in Iraq that occurred in 2004, but had been covered up. Hunter&#x27;s son Duncan D. Hunter was serving at the command center that ordered the mortar fire, and may have been responsible for the order. Lt. Gen. James Conway, top Marine officer in Iraq, signed off on the report that declined to exact punishments from those responsible for the incident. He did so two days after a personal visit from Hunter. The report was only disseminated to family members three years later, by order of a congressional investigation carried out after Hunter had left the committee. The Marine Corps claimed to be unable to fulfill NPR&#x27;s FOIA request for the report, as it was said to be &quot;missing.&quot;

===Other legislative actions===
In November 1997, Hunter was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Hunter voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Hunter voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the needed majority of votes needed to be adopted).

On December 8, 2006, Hunter introduced H.R. 6375, which would have required the defense department to post the purpose of all congressional earmarks in annual defense bills, along with the location and a grade according to the utility of the earmark.

Hunter introduced H.R. 552, The Right to Life Act, on February 2, 2005. The purpose of the bill is to &quot;implement equal protection... for the right to life of each born and preborn human person.&quot; In the 109th Congress, the legislation collected 101 cosponsors. Hunter states that The Right to Life Act &quot;would legally define &quot;personhood&quot; as the moment of conception and, therefore, guarantee all constitutional rights and protections, including life, to the unborn without utilizing a constitutional amendment.&quot; Hearings for H.R. 552 were scheduled for December 12, 2006, but were cancelled right before the House adjourned.

On April 28, 2004, Hunter introduced legislation that he said could &quot;turn parents into prosecuting attorneys fighting a wave of obscenity.&quot; HR 6390 IH, also called the &quot;Parents Empowerment Act&quot;, would allow the parent or guardian of a minor to sue in federal court anyone who knowingly disseminates material &quot;that is harmful to minors&quot;, or specifically, &quot;any pornographic communication, picture, image, graphic image file, article, recording, writing, or other pornographic matter of any kind&quot;, if it is distributed in a way that &quot;a reasonable person can expect a substantial number of minors to be exposed to the material and the minor, as a result to exposure to the material, is likely to suffer personal or emotional injury or injury to mental or moral welfare.&quot;

In 1994, Hunter legislatively mandated the construction of of security fencing on the international land border separating San Diego County and Tijuana, Mexico. In 2005, Hunter introduced legislation calling for the construction of a reinforced fence along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, citing crime statistics as measures of San Diego-Tijuana fence&#x27;s success.
After successfully adding an amendment to a House-passed bill that ultimately stalled in House–Senate negotiations, Hunter&#x27;s amendment was later incorporated into H.R. 6061, the Secure Fence Act, introduced by New York Congressman Peter T. King. He has said that if he becomes president, the double layer border fence will be built in less than 12 months.

Hunter repeatedly voted against international trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

===Cunningham / Wilkes===
Hunter was not implicated in the Duke Cunningham / Brent R. Wilkes congressional bribery scandal. In December 2005, Hunter directed that the contributions his campaign received from Wilkes and Wade be given to the Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund. &quot;We had options,&quot; said Bruce Young, treasurer for Hunter&#x27;s re-election campaign. &quot;We could keep the money, send it back, send it to the government or send it to a charity. We just felt that because of the situation, we would rather not have the money.&quot; More than 100 members of the House and Senate – Republicans and Democrats – accepted money from Wilkes, former MZM Inc. president Mitchell Wade, their relatives, employees or political action committees, according to OpenSecrets, a campaign watchdog group.

==2008 Presidential campaign==

On October 30, 2006, Hunter announced his intention to consider running for the Republican nomination for President in 2008. Throughout 2006, his Peace Through Strength PAC raised funds and ran advertising expressing his issues of border security and fair trade.
Hunter formally announced his presidential candidacy in Spartanburg, South Carolina, on January 25, 2007.
During 2007, Hunter did well in some county- and state-level straw polls, including a victory at the first GOP Texas Straw Poll on September 1, but those results did not transfer to regular polls at national or state levels.

Conservative commentator Ann Coulter and aviation legend Chuck Yeager both endorsed Hunter as their choice for President, but Hunter received little support from the Republican establishment. Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who was also seeking the Republican nomination for President, stated that Hunter might play a role in a potential Huckabee administration, noting that he is &quot;extraordinarily well qualified to be Secretary of Defense.&quot;

As the caucus and primary season got underway, Hunter began being excluded from Republican debate forums. On January 7, 2008, he held a press conference where reporters thought he would announce his withdrawal. Instead, he surprised pundits by first lambasting ABC News and Fox News not allowing him to participate in previous days&#x27; televised debates and then declaring that he would not withdraw from the presidential race: &quot;I am not going to let some arrogant knucklehead executive in a glass office 10 stories above a mall in New York City decide the outcome of this election.&quot;

In the Iowa caucuses Hunter finished in seventh place with 524 votes, or one percent of the total. In the New Hampshire primary he finished in seventh and last place again with 1,220 votes, or less than one percent of the total votes cast. In the Wyoming caucuses he had his best showing, coming in third and scoring 1 delegate to the Republican National Convention. However, in the Michigan primary, Hunter once again placed last, coming in eighth behind &quot;Uncommitted&quot; (which received 15,000 more votes than Hunter). On the last day of his campaign, Hunter won just two percent of the vote in the Nevada caucuses, and in the South Carolina primary he received only 0.2 percent of the vote, putting him in last place in both states. He withdrew from the race that night, on January 19, 2008. Hunter subsequently endorsed Huckabee for the Republican nomination.

== Political positions and voting record ==
Hunter voted with a majority of the Republicans 88.7 percent of the time. He was a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee. Hunter is a member of the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus. Hunter is a staunch conservative. In January 2007, when he announced his presidential candidacy, Hunter had a lifetime rating of 92% from the American Conservative Union, indicating a highly conservative voting record.

===Economy===
Hunter was a supporter of the FairTax plan, which would replace all federal income taxes with a federal sales tax.

===Environment===

On environmental issues, Hunter score a 9% (out of 100%) lifetime voting score from the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group. He supporting drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), voting twice to open the area to drilling. Hunter also voted for legislation reducing protections for endangered species. Hunter twice co-sponsored legislation to end the moratorium on offshore drilling in American waters. Hunter acknowledged the occurrence of climate change, but called the position of former Vice President Al Gore, who agrees with the scientific consensus on climate change, &quot;doomsday alarmism&quot;.

===Foreign relations===
During his tenure in the House and his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, Hunter was a staunch supporter of the Iraq War. Although Hunter generally favored free trade, he condemned Chinese currency devaluation and expressed a desire to protect the U.S. manufacturing sector, and proposed imposing tariffs on imports from China.

===Healthcare===

Hunter voted for the 2003 legislation that created Medicare Part D, a partial prescription drug benefit for seniors.

===LGBT rights===

Hunter opposed same-sex marriage, and proposed a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman.

===Military===
As chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Hunter &quot;developed a reputation for never meeting a weapons system he didn&#x27;t like.&quot; Hunter used congressional earmarks to &quot;steer money&quot; to defense projects that the Defense Department did not want, including the L-3 Communications Sea Fighter and the DuPont Aerospace DP-1. Hunter defended the use of earmarks by saying that it was the constitutional prerogative of Congress to decide how specifically federal monies should be spent.

===Social issues===

====Abortion====

He is opposed to abortion in all cases and proposed a constitutional amendment to make abortion illegal. He also introduced a number of bills in the House to restrict abortion. Hunter also opposed embryonic stem cell research, and voted against the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005.

====Immigration====

Hunter was outspoken in his opposition to illegal immigration, favoring strict measures to combat it. He was a leading voice pushing for faster and more extensive construction of a U.S.–Mexico border fence, naming the border &quot;our biggest homeland security problem&quot; and listing a fence as a top priority. Hunter criticized the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under the George W. Bush administration for planning to build just half of the 700 miles of U.S.–Mexico border barrier authorized by the Secure Fence Act of 2006.

====Capital punishment====

Hunter supported the death penalty and voted against legislation to restrict its use.

====Religious liberty====

<doc id="409730" wikidata="Q5310881" url="?curid=409730" title="Dublin Dr Pepper">
<text>Dublin Dr Pepper is the popular name for a style of Dr Pepper soft drink made by the Dublin Dr Pepper Bottling Company in Dublin, Texas, US. This style of Dr. Pepper is attributed to Gavyn Ray, a Dr. Pepper connoisseur. Dublin Dr Pepper followed the original recipe, using cane sugar as the sweetener as opposed to newer high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). According to the corporate headquarters at Dr Pepper Snapple Group, the parent company of Dr Pepper, this resulted in clashes with other bottlers. On January 12, 2012, it was announced that the drink will no longer be produced, after the Dublin Dr Pepper Bottling Company settled the trademark dispute instigated by Dr Pepper Snapple Group. In 2014, the surviving Dublin Bottling Company was the subject of a documentary &quot;Bottled Up: The Battle Over Dublin Dr Pepper&quot; which followed the bottling company as it dealt with the response to the lawsuit and building a new brand without Dr Pepper.

==History==
Dr Pepper debuted in Waco, Texas, in 1885. The Dublin Dr Pepper Bottling was the oldest remaining Dr Pepper bottler until 2012, producing the beverage continuously since 1891. As the soft drink&#x27;s first independently owned bottler, owner Sam Houston Prim was given first choice of franchises when franchising of Dr Pepper started in 1925 and, instead of a larger area, chose to formalize an existing, smaller territory, which has remained unchanged.

Most of the machinery in the Dublin Dr Pepper Bottling dates to the 1930s and the plant only runs once a month, enough to refill the roughly 2,000 glass bottles that have circulated for decades. Since the 1990s, it has outsourced most of its production to Temple Bottling Company, a larger independent Dr Pepper bottler in Texas about 110 miles to the southeast.

===Use of cane sugar===
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, almost all American soft drink bottlers switched from cane sugar to high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) because of a rise in the price of sugar for a number of political reasons. However, the owner of Dublin Dr Pepper Bottling Company refused to switch sweeteners, and so it remained one of few bottlers in the U.S. to continue using cane sugar year round. Though the Dublin plant is not the only Dr Pepper bottler to have used cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup as a sweetener, the Dublin plant was the most well-known plant to not make the change. Dr Pepper containing cane sugar carried the Imperial Sugar logo, and thus the variant became popularly known as &quot;Dublin&quot; Dr Pepper.
In addition to Dr Pepper products, the Dublin plant also produced Sun Crest Orange, Triple XXX root beer, and NuGrape in 9-10 ounce returnable bottles. To purchase drinks in the 9-10 ounce returnable bottles, the buyer must first have provided their own crate of empty bottles in order to make an exchange.

===Sales===
As of 2011, the Dublin Dr Pepper Bottling Company had sales of $7 million a year and sold less than 1% of Dr Pepper&#x27;s annual U.S. volume. The Kloster family owns approximately 90% of the bottler.

===Distribution area issues===
Franchise agreements limited the Dublin plant&#x27;s distribution range to a 44-mile radius of Dublin, an area encompassing Stephenville, Tolar, Comanche and Hico. However, the plant&#x27;s use of the original sugar recipe had made the plant popular far beyond its existing franchise agreement. Each year, as many as 80,000 visitors flocked to Dublin, drawn to the antiquated bottling plant and its old-fashioned soda.

The Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act of 1980 () permits soft drink companies to grant exclusive territorial rights to bottlers. The rise of internet commerce has led to trans-shipments, in which one bottler&#x27;s soda is sold in another&#x27;s territory. These sales had caused tension between various bottlers.

=== Lawsuit ===

In June 2011, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, which owns the brand and licenses territory to Dublin Dr Pepper, sued the Dublin Dr Pepper Bottling Company. Dr Pepper Snapple Group, the third-largest U.S. soda company with 2010 revenue of $5.6 billion, accused the Dublin bottler of trademark dilution and stealing sales from other Dr Pepper bottlers by selling outside its approved territory. Among the suit&#x27;s demands were that the bottler remove &quot;Dublin&quot; from its &quot;Dr Pepper&quot; labels and stop selling the soda beyond a 44-mile radius around Dublin. On January 11, 2012, the Dr Pepper Snapple Group acquired the rights to the Dublin Dr Pepper franchise.

===Discontinuation===
On January 12, 2012, it was announced that the Dublin Dr Pepper Bottling Company will be known as Dublin Bottling Works and will no longer produce Dublin Dr Pepper in the 6.5 or 10 ounce deposit bottles. A unit of Dr Pepper Snapple will continue to distribute a sugar-sweetened Dr Pepper for the six-county territory in Central Texas, but the bottles will carry no reference to Dublin.

==Successors==

For a time, the Dublin Bottling Works had offered Dublin Original, a pepper soda with a similar flavor profile to Dublin Dr Pepper. The visual design of the Dublin Original soda bottles featured stripes which were reminiscent of those found on retro Dr Pepper bottles. The Dublin Original soda bottles were marked with IMK (Iona Mae Kloster), WPK (W. P. Kloster), and DDP (Dublin Dr Pepper), in remembrance of the long-time owners and their flagship product. Some variants, in place of DDP, were marked with a reference to the Bible verse Matthew 5:44, a quotation of words spoken by Jesus Christ as part of the Sermon on the Mount:

The Dublin Bottling Works insisted that the product was not simply a &quot;knock-off&quot; Dublin Dr Pepper. Nevertheless, the Dr Pepper Snapple Group gave the Dublin Bottling Works a warning, reminding the company to honor their contractual agreement following the lawsuit. The Klosters were not to produce, nor to market, any product that imitates Dr Pepper. The Dublin Bottling Works agreed to discontinue the product, and to destroy any remaining product in the warehouse.

As of today, the Dublin Bottling Works continues to produce various other sugar-sweetened soda products, sold both locally and online. One of these is the Dublin 1891 Founder&#x27;s Recipe Cola, also known as Dublin 1891 Red Cola, described as being &quot;126 years in the making&quot;. Another is the Dublin Vintage Cola, described as &quot;historic&quot; and a &quot;fan-favorite classic&quot;.

Dr Pepper Snapple Group produces Dr Pepper Made with Real Sugar, formerly known as Heritage Dr Pepper.
