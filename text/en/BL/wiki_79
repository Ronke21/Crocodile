<text>was the son and designated successor of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the general who first united all of Japan. His mother, Yodo-dono, was the niece of Oda Nobunaga.

==Early life==
Born in 1593, he was Hideyoshi&#x27;s second son. The birth of Hideyori created a potential succession problem. To avoid it, Hideyoshi exiled his nephew and heir Hidetsugu to Mount Kōya and then ordered him to commit suicide in August 1595. Hidetsugu&#x27;s family members who did not follow his example were then murdered in Kyoto, including 31 women and several children and also Mogami Yoshiaki&#x27;s daughter. Hideyoshi refused to spare the life of Yoshiaki&#x27;s daughter, who had only just arrived in Kyoto to become Hidetsugu&#x27;s concubine and had not yet even met her future husband.

When Hideyoshi died in 1598, the five regents he had appointed to rule in Hideyori&#x27;s place began jockeying amongst themselves for power. Tokugawa Ieyasu seized control in 1600, after his victory over the others at the Battle of Sekigahara. Hideyori&#x27;s arranged marriage to Senhime, the seven-year-old granddaughter of Ieyasu, was designed to mitigate Toyotomi clan dissension and plotting. In this period, the eight-year-old boy practiced calligraphy with phrases wishing for peace throughout the world. 

Fourteen years later, Hideyori was now a young &quot;daimyō&quot; living in Osaka Castle, son and rightful heir to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, Tokugawa Ieyasu continued to view the young Hideyori as a potential threat. Many &quot;samurai&quot; who opposed Ieyasu rallied around Hideyori, claiming that he was the rightful ruler of Japan.

==Conflict with Ieyasu==

Ieyasu found fault with the opening ceremony of a temple (Great Buddha of Kyoto) built by Hideyori; it was as if he prayed for Ieyasu&#x27;s death and the ruin of the Tokugawa clan. Ieyasu ordered Hideyori to leave Osaka Castle, but those in the castle refused and summoned samurai to gather within the castle. Then in 1614, the Tokugawa besieged Osaka Castle against Hideyori.

===Siege of Osaka===

Tokugawa forces led by &quot;Shogun&quot; Tokugawa Hidetada attacked Hideyori in the Siege of Osaka in the winter of 1614, known as &quot;the winter Siege of Osaka&quot;. The attack failed, but Hideyori was induced to sign a truce and dismantle the defenses of his stronghold at Osaka Castle.

In April 1615, Ieyasu received word that Toyotomi Hideyori was gathering even more troops than in the previous November, and that he was trying to stop the filling of the moat of Osaka Castle. Toyotomi forces began to attack contingents of the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s forces near Osaka. On June 5, 1615, Tokugawa attacked Osaka Castle, an attack known as &quot;the summer Siege of Osaka&quot;. As Toyotomi&#x27;s forces began to lose the battle, a smaller force led directly by Hideyori sallied forth from Osaka Castle too late, and was chased right back into the castle by the advancing enemies. There was no time to set up a proper defense of the castle, and it was soon set ablaze and pummeled by artillery fire. Hideyori and his mother committed &quot;seppuku&quot;, and the final major uprising against Tokugawa rule for another 250 or so years was put to an end. His widow remarried but later became a Buddhist nun.

==Death==
According to James Murdoch&#x27;s &quot;A History of Japan During The Century of Early Foreign Discourse&quot;, based heavily upon the works of many Japanese sources (the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Miyoshi-Ki, and many more) as well as heavily based on the writings of the Jesuits, their annual letters, the letters of William Adams and the diaries of Adams&#x27; Dutch comrades, the events of Hideyori&#x27;s death and the final fall of Osaka Castle were as such – Sanada Yukimura had been tactician of the climactic battle outside the gates of Osaka. Recognizing that they had a serious numerical disadvantage, they decided to attempt a tactic of inducing surprise and confusion in the Tokugawa camp. This was to be effected by first, Osaka captain Akashi Morishige getting behind the Tokugawa van, which would then be taken with Akashi&#x27;s surprise attack, fall on Akashi, allowing Sanada with his troops and Mōri Katsunaga, who was in charge of the Osaka &quot;rōnin&quot;, to fall into the Tokugawa front. When the confusion was to be at its height, Hideyori would have marched out of Osaka castle with his home troops and would in theory be the final blow to the Tokugawas.

What happened, according to Murdoch, was that Akashi was not able to get behind the Tokugawa troops, having been discovered and engaged before he emerged from the lanes. The plans fell apart as Mōri&#x27;s &quot;rōnin&quot;, ever eager to fight, began shooting at the Tokugawa ranks, not waiting for Sanada (who was serving as Commander of the battle, in addition to being the tactician of the battle) to command them to do so. Sanada at once told the rōnin to stop but they only doubled their efforts. Mōri Katsunaga, deciding to take advantage of his rōnin&#x27;s eagerness, then decided to launch them forward nevertheless. Upon this, Sanada realized in order to keep any structure of his original plan, he too, would need to engage alongside the &quot;rōnin&quot;. He decided then to launch himself alongside Katsunaga&#x27;s force, straight into the Tokugawas, while dispatching a messenger to Hideyori to march out at that very moment instead of a bit further on as had been decided in the plan.

Hideyori began moving with his troops to leave Osaka. Meanwhile, the Osaka troops had been doing quite well in spite of the numerical disadvantage. It has even been said, in Murdoch&#x27;s book, as he goes to show in an extract from a missionaries letter regarding the event (there were several inside Osaka castle at this point) that the Osaka assault was actually quite successful and drove the Tokugawa back quite promptly. The plan of creating Tokugawa confusion worked and according to the Jesuits, Ieyasu himself, serving as the ultimate reinforcement to the center force, had told his men to kill him if victory seemed for nigh. Not only did the Jesuits write this, but, in another account, Murdoch states that Ieyasu had at least for some time had designs of seppuku because victory seemed to be escaping him.

According to Siebold, at this critical moment, as Hideyori was leaving Osaka to enter the fray, Ieyasu sent forth into Osaka the son of Osaka captain Ōno Harunaga who had been a hostage to the Tokugawa. Ōno Harunaga&#x27;s son entered the castle and immediately dispatched a letter from Ieyasu to his father. The letter said &quot;Do not let Hideyori leave the castle. In the castle is a conspiracy and as soon as Hideyori leaves it he will be attacked from the rear.&quot; It is because of this letter, according to Siebold, that Hideyori&#x27;s portion of the plan miscarried. He was just about to leave when he was brought word of its contents, and at this point, stalled in entering the fray.

Eventually, despite the ferocity and initial victories of the Osaka troops, the numerical advantage of the Tokugawa forces proved too much. According to the Nihon Senshi:

&quot;Hideyori, when he received intelligence of the defeat of his rōnin, said, &quot;Death is what I have been ready to meet for long&quot;, and was about to sally from the castle in order to fight his very last battle when he was stopped by Hayami, one of his seven captains, who urged that a commander-in-chief should not expose his person among the promiscuous dead. Let Hideyori defend the castle to the last; when it fell, it would be time to take a decision!&quot;

And amidst the ensuing chaos, Hideyori fell back. The castle was fired and general chaos ensued. This Hayami, one of his seven captains, eventually lead Hideyori, his wife, the daughter of the &quot;shōgun&quot; and granddaughter of Ieyasu, and his mother, Yodogimi to a fire proof keep in the castle. From here, Hideyori&#x27;s wife, the daughter of the &quot;shōgun&quot;, left to beg of her father and grand father to spare Hideyori. According to Murdoch, when she finally reached the &quot;shōgun&quot;, Hidetada, he had remarked coldly to her, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you die with your husband?&quot; which was customary. However, Ieyasu feigned compassion and instructed Tokugawa captains Ii and Ando to see to Hideyori&#x27;s safe retreat.

Hideyori, however, remained in the fire-proof keep with his mother and, having sent dispatches to Ieyasu and Hidetada, waited for a response. He was given none and, upon his fire-proof keep being fired upon by the forces of Ii and Ando, allegedly then committed ritual suicide and the keep was destroyed.

Although Ii had been tasked with seeing to Hideyori&#x27;s safe retreat, when, shortly after, Ii had reported the affairs to Ieyasu and told of his exceeding the orders he&#x27;d been given and, thereupon asked Ieyasu to punish him accordingly, according to Murdoch&#x27;s book, Ieyasu merely nodded without saying anything and Ii left Ieyasu&#x27;s presence. Not but a few weeks later Ii received a raise on his revenue at Hikone, in Omi, the sum going from 180,000 &quot;koku&quot; to 230,000 &quot;koku&quot; and still, later on, in 1617 to 280,000 &quot;koku&quot;.

==Survival myths==
Hideyori&#x27;s actual corpse was never discovered, and a popular rumor persisted that Hideyori had escaped Osaka. The rumors had enough merit to concern the Tokugawa shogunate, according to Murdoch. The matter was serious enough that it found mention in the journals of Richard Cocks, the comrade of William Adams. The following extracts from Cocks&#x27; journal explain the matter at hand:

&quot;September 18th, 1616

Capt. Adames went againe to the Cort [at Yedo] to procure our dispatch, and found all the Council busied about matters of justice of life and death; and amongst the rest, one man was brought in question about Fidaia Samme [Hideyori], as being in the castle with him to the last hour. This man was racked and tormented very much, to make him confess where his master was, or whether he were alive or dead; but I cannot hear whether he confessed anything or no.&quot;

&quot;May 5th, 1616

The son of Tuan Dono of Langasaque [ Nagasaki ] [i.e the brother of the Japanese Jesuit killed at the storming of Osaka], departed to sea with 13 barkes laden with soldiers to take the island Taccasange, called per them soe, but by us Isla Fermosa. And it is reported he is at Goto, staying for more succors which are to come from Miaco, and thought they mean to go for Lequea [Loochoo], to look for Fidaia Samme [Hideyori].&quot;

&quot;July 7th, 1616

Speeches given out that the Tono, or King, of Xaxma [ Satsuma ] meaneth to make wars against the new Emperor [Hidetada] in right of Fidaia Samme [Hideyori], whom they report to be alive, and that he meaneth to begyn with Langasaque. This is now the common report.&quot;

&quot;October 15th, 1616

And it is said Fidaia Samme is alive; but what will come hereof I know not.&quot;

Hideyori&#x27;s son, Kunimatsu (age 8) was captured and beheaded; his daughter Naahime (Princess Naa) (age 7) was sent to Tōkei-ji, a convent in Kamakura, where she later became the twentieth abbess Tenshūin (1608–1645).

<doc id="407838" wikidata="Q2517939" url="?curid=407838" title="Notothenia microlepidota">
<text>Notothenia microlepidota, the black cod or small-scaled cod, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, belonging to the family Nototheniidae, the notothens or cod icefishes. It is native to the Pacific waters around New Zealand and Macquarie Island. This species can reach a total length of . It is a commercially important species.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Notothenia microlepidota&quot; was first formally described in 1875 by the English-born New Zealand scientist Frederick Wollaston Hutton with the type locality given as Dunedin and Dunedin and Moeraki in New Zealand. The specific name &quot;microlepidota&quot; means &quot;small scaled&quot; which is thought to be a reference to its small, numerous scales when compared to &quot;N. angustata&quot; which Wollaston described in the same paper.

==Description==
&quot;Notothenia microlepidota&quot; juveniles have a silvery appearance and their caudal fin is clearly forked. The adults have a less obviously forked caudal fin. The colour of the body is silver, yellow and reddish-brown. The body is covered in very small scales and there are two lateral lines which have a considerable overlap. The shortbased first dorsal fin has 6-7 spines, the second dorsal fin has 27-28 soft rays while the anal fin has 23-24 soft rays. This species attains a maximum total length of .

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Notothenia microlepidota&quot; is restricted to New Zealand and Macquarie Island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. They have been found in depths of a few metres off Campbell Island and have been trawled at offshore.

==Biology==
In the Campbell Plateau, salps are the most important prey, followed by amphipods(particularly &quot;Parathemisto gaudichaudii&quot;) and percophidids. Crabs such as the portunid crab &quot;Nectocarcinus bennetti&quot; are also important prey. These prey items imply benthic feeding habits, typical for notothenids.

Being a subantarctic species, the black cod has special adaptations such as antifreeze proteins in its blood, as well as adipose tissues to offset its lack of a swim bladder, giving it neutral buoyancy. The sablefish, &quot;Anoplopoma fimbria&quot;, is occasionally called black cod, as well, but it is not a true cod. In New Zealand, the Maori cod is also known as &quot;black cod&quot;. They are a common prey item of seals.

<text>Theodor Dumitru Stolojan (; born 24 October 1943) is a Romanian politician who was Prime Minister of Romania from September 1991 to November 1992. An economist by training, he was also one of the presidents of the National Liberal Party (PNL) before being the founding leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (PLD) and then the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL). He was a Member of the European Parliament for Romania, representing the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) and then the National Liberal Party (PNL; both EPP-ED-affiliated). He was also professor at the Transilvania University of Brașov between 2002 and 2012.

== Career ==

Before the Romanian Revolution, Stolojan worked at the Committee for State Planning, together with Nicolae Văcăroiu, who subsequently became President of the Senate between 20 December 2000 and 14 October 2008.

During the rule of Nicolae Ceaușescu, he worked at the Ministry of Finances between 1972 and 1977 as an economist in the State Budget Department, then between 1978 and 1982 as Chief of Accountancy of State Budget and then as deputy director of the Department for Foreign Exchange and International Financial Relations until the Romanian Revolution.

He was the Prime minister of Romania from September 1991 to November 1992, then worked for the World Bank and for a Romanian private company. In 1992, the Stolojan government began an austerity plan, limiting wages and further liberalising prices. The economic situation deteriorated and inflation as well as unemployment increased substantially. After his term ended, he worked at the World Bank.

In 2000, he re-entered politics as a member of the National Liberal Party (PNL); he ran for the presidency of Romania in the November 2000 elections, but came in third, behind Ion Iliescu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor. He was named president of the PNL in August 2002.

In 2003, his party approached the Democratic Party leader Traian Băsescu, at that time the mayor of Bucharest, and initiated an alliance named &quot;D.A. - Dreptate şi Adevăr&quot; (Justice and Truth Alliance). In February 2004, he was chosen as the alliance&#x27;s candidate in the Romanian presidential election of November 2004.

On 2 October 2004, Stolojan surprisingly stepped down from the leadership of the PNL and also withdrew from the presidential race. He cited serious health problems as a reason for his decision. Stolojan became a senior advisor to Băsescu after the latter was inaugurated as president on 20 December 2004.

On 10 October 2006, Stolojan was expelled from the PNL, and in December he formed a new party, the Liberal Democrats (PLD), whose president he was elected at the first PLD congress on 31 March 2007. In January 2008, the PLD merged with the Democratic Party to form the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL), of which Stolojan was then a member.

The PDL won the most seats in the 2008 election, and on 10 December 2008, Stolojan was designated prime minister of Romania by President Traian Băsescu. Five days later, he withdrew his acceptance, saying he was stepping down in favour of a younger candidate; Emil Boc was then selected.

==Personal life==
He and his wife Elena have a son, Vlad Stolojan, and a daughter, Ada Palea.

<text>Innisfil is a town in Ontario, Canada, located on the western shore of Lake Simcoe in Simcoe County, immediately south of Barrie and north of Toronto. It has historically been a rural area, but since it is geographically sandwiched between the high-growth areas of Barrie and the York Region, there has been growing residential development in Innisfil.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Innisfil&quot; comes from the Irish &quot;Inis Fáil&quot;, an ancient mythological name for Ireland.

==History==
The history of Innisfil spans a period in excess of 170 years. The Town was hewn from almost unbroken virgin forests which had been home to the Huron Indians, and was first surveyed in 1820. The area encompassed 68,653 acres (278 km2), including the villages of Allandale, Tollendal, Painswick, Minets Point, and Holly at the time.

The first settlers were the Hewson and Soules families who came by way of the East Holland River and Lake Simcoe to settle at Point Endeavour; they renamed the area Hewson&#x27;s Point (later named Big Bay Point). The Hewsons settled on March 30, 1820, and the Soules in 1822. The Warnica family settled the following year, in 1823, in the area now known as Painswick. The first sawmill in the Township was built at Tollendal by George McMullen in 1829. At this time James Soules owned a sawmill on the south half of lot 26 concession fourteen (Big Bay Point), Innisfil where he made the lumber for the construction of the first frame house in Innisfil for Lewis J. Clement.

John and George Warnica completed the clearing of the bush between Barrie and Churchill. John Cayton had won the contract to open the road between Churchill and the 11th line of West Gwillimbury but only made it one mile north to the 12th, known as Cayton&#x27;s Corners. Owing to his slight acquaintance with the forest, he sub-let the work to John and George Warnica who completed Cayton&#x27;s contract between the 4th line of Innisfil (Churchill) and the 12th line of West Gwillimbury, north of Bradford. This opened the land route, known as Penetanguishene Road, which later became part of Yonge Street. It was later designated as a portion of Highway 11 and is now Simcoe County Road 4. This route between York (now Toronto) and Barrie was completed in the fall of 1825.

Along this road the settlers came, and spread out along the concession lines to clear the lands and develop their farms. There had been those who came ahead by way of the river and the lake; many settled near the shores of Lake Simcoe and Kempenfelt Bay. The only channels of communication were the public roads, and these were scant and poor.

The pioneer farms cut from the forest were mostly self-sustaining. What few products there were for sale found a market in nearby Barrie, which was then little more than a village. Distant York was reached in the winter when the ice and snow made for better roads.

During this period, post offices, churches, and stores were established, also a form of local government performed by commissioners was appointed under a provincial act. The first post office, then called Innisfil, was located at what is now called Barclay&#x27;s Corners. The first school was built in 1838 and located at Myers Corners, later called Victoria (now the community of Stroud). The first church was also at Victoria, and was of Methodist denomination.

Milling in Innisfil was first done at Tollendal in 1835. The need for a grist mill to grind wheat is an indication of the progress toward an agricultural community.

The earliest official record of a census shows that by 1842 the population of Innisfil was 762.

===Establishment===
The year 1850 marked the end of the old commissioners&#x27; rule. The population had increased to 1,807, nearly tripling in under a decade. The first municipal council was established, replacing the government of appointed commissioners. The Corporation of the Township of Innisfil was born.

The settlement of Allandale became more prominent with the construction of the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway (later the Northern Railway) from Toronto to Collingwood. The first train from Toronto arrived in Allandale on October 11, 1853.

The continued building of public roads, together with the railway and the lake navigation, resulted in the establishment of more flourishing hamlet settlements.

Belle Ewart was formed in 1854. Henry&#x27;s Corners, now Thornton, was formed in 1833. Perry&#x27;s Corners, now Cookstown, was formed around 1859. Hamlet settlement also resulted in a burgeoning resort development along the entire shoreline.

In 1891, 500 acres (2 km2) of Innisfil became incorporated as the Village of Allandale, now part of the City of Barrie. Barrie annexed a further 500 acres (2 km2) in 1897.

Innisfil flourished over the years and by 1950, had a population of 3,500. However, paved roads, the automobile (the first recorded in the town was 1912), the price of fuel, and the cost of housing outside Toronto, encouraged commuter residents. This, in turn, gradually changed the nature of Innisfil&#x27;s shoreline development. Seasonal housing evolved to permanent residential. Now, about 90% of the shoreline is permanent residences.

===Modern development===
Cookstown, at the southwest extremity of the town, became an incorporated village in 1962, with 100 acres (400,000 m2) of Innisfil becoming part of Cookstown.

In 1967, 597 acres (2.4 km2) were annexed from Innisfil by the City of Barrie to accommodate the establishment of the Formosa Spring Brewery. The modern brewery was located on the northwest corner of the land, beside Ontario Highway 400, a notable landmark due to its three large and brightly coloured tanks. In 1974, the facility was purchased by Molson&#x27;s and the empty land was developed into a park and concert venue known as Molson Park. Molson closed the brewery after purchasing Carling O&#x27;Keefe in 1989, moving operations to Carling&#x27;s recently renovated brewery near Pearson International Airport in Toronto. Molson then sub-let the brewery buildings to other businesses while selling off the land, before the it closed entirely and forms today&#x27;s Park Place.

On January 1, 1982, 8,623 acres (35 km2) were annexed to the City of Barrie, with a further 737 acres (3 km2) to be annexed January 1, 1987. As a result of the annexations, Innisfil&#x27;s population was reduced by approximately 26.7% to 12,153 permanent residents, and its total assessment was reduced by 20.4%.

On January 1, 1991, by virtue of the South Simcoe Act, the Township of Innisfil, a northern section of the Township of West Gwillimbury, and the Village of Cookstown, were amalgamated and incorporated as the Town of Innisfil.

In 1993, the Ontario Stockyards livestock facility, located for a long time in The Junction / West Toronto area in Toronto, relocated to just east of the Cookstown town site, on Highway 89.

The County of Simcoe Act provided for further restructuring of Simcoe County on January 1, 1994, when the Village of Thornton was amalgamated with the Township of Essa and a small section of the Township of Essa, adjacent to Cookstown, was amalgamated with Innisfil.

As of 2006, Innisfil had a total permanent population of 31,175 and an estimated seasonal population of 4,000 people. Having begun as a community of seasonal homes for people living in Toronto, it is now a popular place for permanent residents, mostly families and empty-nesters and, indeed, most of the &quot;cottages&quot; along the lake shore have since been converted into year-round homes.

The province of Ontario enacted legislation that enabled the City of Barrie to annex from the Town of Innisfil on January 1, 2010. The land in question extended south beyond 10th line west of the 10th Sideroad, and as far south as Lockhart Road on the east side of the 10th Sideroad. Innisfil retained the community of Stroud, but the community of St. Pauls was shifted to Barrie.

In 2017, the mixed-use development Friday Harbour opened on Big Bay Point.

In 2019, Cortel Group proposed a long-term transit-oriented development, dubbed &quot;The Orbit&quot;, around the station with the goal of 30,000 people living in the area in the near future. Initially, the long-term goal after the development&#x27;s completion was for 150,000 residents, though this has since been reduced to 90,000 residents and 20,000 jobs. That November, Innisfil Town Council approved &quot;The Orbit&quot; as Cortel committed to funding the station. In 2020, the provincial government issued a minister&#x27;s zoning order (MZO) to expedite &quot;The Orbit&quot;.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Innisfil had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

===Policing, EMS and Fire Services===

Policing in Innisfil is provided by the South Simcoe Police Service. Innisfil Fire and Rescue Service provides fire services in the town from 4 stations (Lefroy, Stroud, Cookstown and Innisfil) and EMS by the County of Simcoe Paramedic Services Stroud Paramedic station.

==Transportation==

The Barrie line of the GO Transit commuter rail system passes through Innisfil, but does not stop in the town, although a planned future station is awaiting construction. Highway 400 runs through the west side of the town and connects it to Toronto.

Innisfil signed a contract with Uber to provide subsidized microtransit service to residents in the community, in lieu of a traditional fixed-route bus service. The service began in 2017 and attracted 8,000 monthly trips in its first year, but fares were increased in 2019 due to the rising cost of the subsidy. There are flat fares of either $4 or $6 to or from certain designated community hubs, or a $4 discount off regular Uber fares for other destinations. To control costs, there is a 30-ride cap per month on flat and discounted fares, after which riders must pay regular Uber fares. However, riders dependant on the service can apply for an additional 20 subsidized trips per month.

==Culture==
Cookstown is a hub of antique specialty stores and outlet shopping, and is known as the antique capital of southern Ontario. Tanger Outlets Cookstown, originally the Cookstown Manufacturers&#x27; Outlet Mall, opened in 1995. Cookstown is also known for its annual garage sale called &quot;Wing-Ding&quot; which occurs the first weekend of June every year. The Cookstown Fair is held annually, usually in September.

Cookstown is the birthplace of Emily Murphy, a noted Canadian women&#x27;s rights activist. In 1916, she became the first woman police magistrate in Alberta, and in the British Empire. She is best known for her contributions to Canadian feminism, specifically to the question of whether women were &quot;persons&quot; under Canadian law.

A TV movie, &quot;Murder She Purred: A Mrs. Murphy Mystery&quot;, was filmed in Cookstown in 1998.

Alcona hosts Summerfest and Winterfest at Innisfil Beach road in the early summer and mid winter, each year at Innisfil Beach located at the end of Innisfil Beach Rd (8th Line).

Georgian Downs Harness racetrack and casino is located on the 5th Sideroad near the Highway 400 interchange at Innisfil Beach Road.

<text>Education in China is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under the Ministry of Education. All citizens must attend school for a minimum of nine years, known as nine-year compulsory education, which is funded by the government.

Compulsory education includes six years of elementary school, typically starting at the age of six and finishing at the age of twelve, followed by three years of middle school and three years of high school.

In 2020, the Ministry of Education reported an increase of new entrants of 34.4 million students entering compulsory education, bringing the total number of students who attend compulsory education to 156 million.

In 1985, the government abolished tax-funded higher education, requiring university applicants to compete for scholarships based on their academic capabilities. In the early 1980s, the government allowed the establishment of the first private institution of higher learning, thus increasing the number of undergraduates and people who hold doctoral degrees from 1995 to 2005.

Chinese investment in research and development has grown by 20 percent per year since 1999, exceeding $100 billion in 2011. As many as 1.5 million science and engineering students graduated from Chinese universities in 2006. By 2008, China had published 184,080 papers in recognized international journals – a seven-fold increase from 1996. In 2017, China surpassed the U.S. with the highest number of scientific publications. In 2021, there were 3,012 universities and colleges (see List of universities in China) in China, and 147 National Key Universities, which are considered to be part of an elite group Double First Class universities, accounted for approximately 4.6% of all higher education institutions in China.

China has also been a top destination for international students and as of 2013, China was the most popular country in Asia for international students and ranked third overall among countries. China is now the leading destination globally for Anglophone African students and is host of the second largest international students population in the world. As of 2024, there were 18 Chinese universities on lists of the global top 200 behind only the United States and the United Kingdom in terms of the overall representation in the &quot;Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities&quot;, a composite ranking system combining three of the world&#x27;s most influential university rankings (ARWU+QS+ THE).

Shanghai, Beijing, Jiangsu and Zhejiang outperformed all other education systems in the Programme for International Student Assessment. China&#x27;s educational system has been noted for its emphasis on rote memorization and test preparation. However, PISA spokesman Andreas Schleicher says that China has moved away from learning by rote in recent years. According to Schleicher, Russia performs well in rote-based assessments, but not in PISA, whereas China does well in both rote-based and broader assessments.

==History==
Improving population-wide literacy was the focus of education in the early years of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1949, the literacy rate was between 20 and 40 percent. The communist government focused on improving literacy through both formal schooling and literacy campaigns. In the first sixteen years of communist governance, elementary school enrollment tripled, secondary school enrollment increased by a factor of 8.5, and college enrollment more than quadrupled.

Since the end of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), the education system in China has been geared towards economic modernization. In 1985, the federal government ceded responsibility for basic education to local governments through the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s &quot;Decision on the Reform of the Educational Structure&quot;. With the education reform plan in May 1985, the authorities called for nine years of compulsory education and the establishment of the State Education Commission (created the following month). Official commitment to improved education was nowhere more evident than in the substantial increase in funds for education in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986–1990), which amounted to 72 percent more than funds allotted to education in the previous plan period (2081–20
85). In 2086, 23.9 percent of the state budget was earmarked for education, compared to 10.4 percent in 1984.

As a result of continual intra-party realignments, official policy has alternated between ideological imperatives and practical efforts to further national education. The Great Leap Forward (1958–1960) and the Socialist Education Movement (1962–1965) sought to end deeply rooted academic elitism, to narrow social and cultural gaps between workers and peasants and between urban and rural populations, and to eliminate the tendency of scholars and intellectuals to disdain manual labor. During the Cultural Revolution, universal fostering of social equality was an overriding priority.
The post-Mao Zedong Chinese Communist Party leadership views education as the foundation of the Four Modernizations. In the early 1980s, science and technology education became an important focus of education policy. By 1986, training skilled personnel and expanding scientific and technical knowledge had been assigned the highest priority. Although the humanities were considered important, vocational and technical skills were considered paramount for meeting China&#x27;s modernization goals.

The reorientation of educational priorities paralleled Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s strategy for economic development. Emphasis also was placed on the further training of the already-educated elite, who would carry on the modernization program in the coming decades. A renewed emphasis on modern science and technology led to the adoption of an outward-looking policy that encouraged learning and borrowing from abroad for advanced training in a wide range of scientific fields, beginning in 1976.

Beginning at the Third Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee in December 1978, intellectuals were encouraged to pursue research in support of the Four Modernizations and, as long as they complied with the party&#x27;s &quot;Four Cardinal Principles&quot; they were given relatively free rein. When the party and the government determined that the structures of the four cardinal principles had been stretched beyond tolerable limits, they might restrict intellectual expression.

Literature and the arts also experienced a great revival in the late 1970s and 1980s. Traditional forms flourished once again, and many new kinds of literature and cultural expression were introduced from abroad.

In 2003, China&#x27;s Ministry of Education called for adding environmental education content throughout the public school curriculum from the first year of primary school through the second year of high school.

==Development==
Since the 1950s, China has been providing a nine-year compulsory education to what amounts to a fifth of the world&#x27;s population. By 1999, primary school education had become generalized in 90% of China, and mandatory nine-year compulsory education now effectively covered 85% of the population, but some rural areas in China still can not reach the goal of the nine-year compulsory education,because of the lack of teachers and hard to access. The education funding provided by the central and provincial governments varies across regions, and those in the rural areas are notably lower than those in major urban areas. Families supplement money provided to the school by the government with tuition fees.

For non-compulsory education, China adopts a shared-cost mechanism, charging tuition at a certain percentage of the cost. Meanwhile, to ensure that students from low-income families have access to higher education, the government has initiated ways of assistance, with policies and measures for scholarships, work-study programs and subsidies for students with special economic difficulties, tuition reduction or exemption and state stipends.

Illiteracy in the young and mid-aged population has fallen from over 80 percent down to five percent. The system trained some 60 million mid-or high-level professionals and almost 400 million laborers to the junior or senior high school level. Today, 250 million Chinese get three levels of school education (elementary, junior, and senior high school), doubling the rate of increase in the rest of the world during the same period. Net elementary school enrollment has reached 98.9 percent, and the gross enrollment rate in junior high schools 94.1 percent. , the government-operated primary and lower secondary (junior high) schools in China have 28.8 million students.

Chinese high school students won multiple gold medals every year consistently at many International Science Olympiad Competitions like the International Biology Olympiad, the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, the International Olympiad in Informatics, the International Earth Science Olympiad, the International Mathematical Olympiad, the International Physics Olympiad and the International Chemistry Olympiad. As of 2022, China ranks first in the all-time medal count at the International Mathematical Olympiad with highest goal medals since its first participation in 1985. China also ranks first in the all-time medal count at the International Physics Olympiad, the International Chemistry Olympiad, and the International Olympiad in Informatics.

In a 2009 survey from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils&#x27; scholastic performance by the OECD, Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the best results in mathematics, science and reading. The OECD also found that even in some of the very poor rural areas the performance is close to the OECD average. While averages across the breadth of other countries are reported, China&#x27;s rankings are taken from only a few select districts. The PISA 2018 results showed that students of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang topped the rankings in reading, mathematics and science and China&#x27;s school children are now the smartest in the world based on academic performance. OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria said the students from the four Chinese provinces had &quot;outperformed by a large margin their peers from all of the other 78 participating countries&quot; and the 10% most socio-economically disadvantaged students in these four areas &quot;also showed better reading skills than those of the average student in OECD countries, as well as skills similar to the 10% most advantaged students in some of OECD countries&quot;. He cautioned that these four provinces and municipalities &quot;are far from representing China as a whole.&quot; Yet their combined populations amount to over 180 million people, and the size of each region is equivalent to a typical OECD country even if their income is well below the OECD average. &quot;What makes their achievement even more remarkable is that the level of income of these four Chinese regions is well below the OECD average&quot;.

In the 1980s, the MBA was virtually unknown but by 2004 there were 47,000 MBAs, trained at 62 MBA schools. Many people also apply for international professional qualifications, such as EMBA and MPA; close to 10,000 MPA students are enrolled in 47 schools of higher learning, including Peking University and Tsinghua University. The education market has rocketed, with training and testing for professional qualifications, such as computer and foreign languages, thriving. Continuing education is the trend, once in one&#x27;s life schooling has become lifelong learning.

Investment in education has increased in recent years; the proportion of the overall budget allocated to education has been increased by one percentage point every year since 1998. According to a Ministry of Education program, the government will set up an educational finance system in line with the public finance system, strengthen the responsibility of governments at all levels in educational investment, and ensure that their financial allocation for educational expenditure grows faster than their regular revenue. The program also laid out the government&#x27;s aim that educational investment should account for four percent of GDP in a relatively short period of time.

==Education policy==
China&#x27;s Five-Year Plans are an important means of coordinating education policy.

Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s far-ranging educational reform policy, which involved all levels of the education system, aimed to narrow the gap between China and other developing countries. Thus, modernizing education was critical to modernizing China, which included; devolution of educational management from the central to the local level as the means chosen to improve the education system. Centralized authority was not abandoned, however, as evidenced by the creation of the State Education Commission.

Academically, the goals of reform were to enhance and universalize elementary and junior middle school education; to increase the number of schools and qualified teachers, and to develop vocational and technical education. A uniform standard for curricula, textbooks, examinations, and teacher qualifications (especially at the middle-school level) was established, and considerable autonomy and variations in and among the autonomous regions, provinces, and special municipalities were allowed. Further, the system of enrollment and job assignment in higher education was changed, with government control over colleges and universities was reduced.

Intergenerational transmission of socialist ideas is an explicit commitment of China&#x27;s educational system. In 1991, the communist party launched the nationwide Patriotic Education Campaign. The major focus of the campaign was within education, and text books were revised to reduce narratives of class struggle and to emphasize the party&#x27;s role in ending the century of humiliation.As part of the campaign, Patriotic Education Bases were established, and schools ranging from primary to the college levels were required to take students to sites of significance to the Chinese Revolution.

At a national education conference held in Beijing on 10 September 2018, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Xi Jinping emphasized the importance of teaching Chinese socialism to the country&#x27;s youth, in order to foster support for the CCP and its policies.

Xi has implemented a number of education reforms. Schools are required to adjust their opening hours to be consistent with work hours in their area so that parents can pick-up their children directly after work (in order to reduce reliance on private classes for adult supervision after school hours). Schools must also promote health by requiring outdoor physical education classes daily and providing eye examinations twice per term. Educational reforms have also limited the amount of homework students can be assigned. In Uyghur communities, Islamic education for children has been prohibited and teaching the Quran to children has resulted in criminal prosecution.

As part of Xi&#x27;s 2021 directive on &quot;double lessening&quot; (reducing excessive off-campus tutoring and reducing homework burdens), schools may not assign homework to children to grades one and two, homework is limited to no more than 60 minutes for children in grades three to six, and no more than 90 minutes for middle school children. In July 2021, China enacted a series of rules designed to shutdown the private tutoring.

Since September 2021, private schools providing compulsory education can no longer be controlled by foreign entities or individuals. Only Chinese nationals may serve on their Boards of Directors.

In general, China&#x27;s minority regions have some of the highest per capita government spending on education, among other public goods and services. Providing public goods and services in these areas part of a government effort to reduce regional inequalities, reduce the risk of separatism, and stimulate economic development. As of at least 2019, Tibet is the region of China with the largest per capita government spending on education.

Education consistently ranks as the highest category of local government expenditures.

==Education system==
===Compulsory education law===
The Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education (), which took effect on 1 July 1986, established requirements and deadlines for attaining universal education tailored to local conditions and guaranteed school-age children the right to receive at least nine years of education (six-year primary education and three years secondary education). People&#x27;s congresses at various local levels were, within certain guidelines and according to local conditions, to decide the steps, methods, and deadlines for implementing nine-year compulsory education in accordance with the guidelines formulated by the central authorities. The program sought to bring rural areas, which had four to six years of compulsory schooling, into line with their urban counterparts. Education departments were exhorted to train millions of skilled workers for all trades and professions and to offer guidelines, curricula, and methods to comply with the reform program and modernization needs.

Provincial-level authorities were to develop plans, enact decrees and rules, distribute funds to counties, and administer directly a few key secondary schools. County authorities were to distribute funds to each township government, which was to make up for any deficiencies. County authorities were to supervise education and teaching and to manage their own senior high schools, teachers&#x27; schools, teachers&#x27; in-service training schools, agricultural vocational schools, and exemplary primary and junior high schools. The remaining schools were to be managed separately by the county and township authorities.

The compulsory education law divided China into three categories: cities and economically developed areas in coastal provinces and a small number of developed areas in the hinterland; towns and villages with medium development; and economically backward areas.

By November 1985, the first category – the larger cities and approximately 20 percent of the counties (mainly in the more developed coastal and southeastern areas of China) – had achieved universal 9-year education. By 1990, cities, economically developed areas in coastal provincial-level units, a small number of developed interior areas (approximately 25 percent of China&#x27;s population), and areas where junior high schools were already popularized were targeted to have universal junior-high-school education.

Education planners envisioned that by the mid-1990s, all workers and staff in coastal areas, inland cities, and moderately developed areas (with a combined population of 300 million to 400 million people) would have either compulsory 9-year or vocational education and that 5 percent of the people in these areas would have a college education, building a solid intellectual foundation for China. Furthermore, the planners expected that secondary education and university entrants would have increased by the year 2000.

The second category targeted under the 9-year compulsory education law consisted of towns and villages with medium-level development (around 50 percent of China&#x27;s population), where universal education was expected to reach the junior-high-school level by 1995. Technical and higher education was projected to develop at the same rate.

The third category, economically backward (rural) areas (around 25 percent of China&#x27;s population), were to popularize basic education without a timetable and at various levels according to local economic development, though the state would try to support educational development. The state also would assist education in minority nationality areas. In the past, rural areas, which lacked a standardized and universal primary education system, had produced generations of illiterates; only 60 percent of their primary school graduates had met established standards.

As a further example of the government&#x27;s commitment to nine-year compulsory education, in January 1986 the State Council drafted a bill passed at the Fourteenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People&#x27;s Congress that made it illegal for any organization or individual to employ youths before they had completed their nine years of schooling. The bill also authorized free education and subsidies for students whose families had financial difficulties.

Tuition-free primary education is, despite compulsory education laws, still a target rather than a realized goal throughout China. As many families have difficulty paying school fees, some children are forced to leave school earlier than the nine-year goal.

The 9-year System is called &quot;Nine Years – One Policy&quot;, or &quot;&quot; in Chinese. It usually refers to the educational integration of the elementary school and the middle school. After graduating from elementary school, graduates can directly enter into the junior high school. The grades in schools that implement the 9-year System are usually called Grade 1, Grade 2, and so on through Grade 9.

Main features of the 9-year System:
# Continuity. Students finish education from the elementary school to the middle school.
# The principle of proximity. Students enter into the nearby school instead of middle school entrance examination.
# Unity. Schools that carry out the 9-year System practice unified management in school administration, teaching and education.

In 2001, the Chinese government initiated the &quot;Two exemptions and one subsidy plan&quot;. Students from poor families receiving compulsory education in rural areas are exempted from miscellaneous fees and book fees, and boarding students are gradually subsidized for living expenses. In 2007, all rural students receiving compulsory education from poor families enjoyed the policy of two exemptions and one subsidy, totaling about 50 million students. Starting in 2017, two exemptions and one subsidy under the urban-rural unified system will be implemented.

===Basic education===

China&#x27;s basic education involves pre-school(around 3 years), nine-year compulsory education from elementary to junior high school, standard senior high school education, special education for disabled children, and education for illiterate people.

China has over 200 million elementary and high school students, who, together with pre-school children, account for one sixth of the total population. For this reason, the Central Government has prioritized basic education as a key field of infrastructure construction and educational development.

In recent years, senior high school education has developed steadily. In 2004 enrollment was 8.215 million, 2.3 times that of 1988. Gross national enrollment in senior high schools has reached 43.8 percent, still lower than that of other developed countries.

The government has created a special fund to improve conditions in China&#x27;s elementary and high schools, for new construction, expansion, and the re-building of run-down structures. Per-capita educational expenditure for elementary and high school students has grown greatly, teaching and research equipment, books, and documents being updated and renewed every year.

Government&#x27;s aim for the development of China&#x27;s basic education system is to approach or attain the level of moderately developed countries by 2010.

Graduates of China&#x27;s primary and secondary schools test highly in both basic skills and critical thinking skills; however, due to poor health, rural students often drop out or lack in achievement.

===Key schools===
&quot;Key schools&quot; is a term for institutions with a record of academic achievements which were given priority in the assignment of teachers, equipment, and funds. Many of these key schools were shut down during the Cultural Revolution, reappeared in the late 1970s and, in the early 1980s, and became an integral part of the effort to revive the lapsed education system. Because educational resources were scarce, key schools also were allowed to recruit the best students for special training to compete for admission to top schools at the next level. Key schools constituted only a small percentage of all regular senior high schools and funneled the best students into the best secondary schools, largely on the basis of entrance scores. In 1980 the greatest resources were allocated to the key schools that would produce the greatest number of college entrants.

In early 1987, efforts had begun to develop the key school from a preparatory school into a vehicle for diffusing improved curricula, materials, and teaching practices in local schools. Moreover, the appropriateness of a key school&#x27;s role in the nine-year basic education plan was questioned by some officials because key schools favored urban areas and the children of more affluent and better educated parents. Changchun, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Xiamen, and other cities, and education departments in Shanghai and Tianjin were moving to establish a student recommendation system and eliminate key schools. In 1986 the Shanghai Educational Bureau abolished the key junior-high-school system to ensure &quot;an overall level of education&quot;. Despite the effort to abolish the &quot;Key Schools&quot; system, the practice still exists today under other names, and education inequality is still being widely criticized by some government officials and scholars.

===Training schools===
Training schools, also called training centers, are a type of private education offered by companies that teach students in China who are typically from 3–12 years old. These schools exist to improve student performance in academic subjects such as English, math, and Chinese. Training schools can range from a one-room operation with only one teacher to very large corporations with hundreds of thousands of students.

==Primary education==
===Primary schools===
The institution of primary education in a country as vast as China has been an impressive accomplishment. In contrast to the 20 percent enrollment rate before 1949, in 1985 about 96 percent of primary school age children were enrolled in approximately 832,300 primary schools. This enrollment figure compared favorably with the recorded figures of the late 1960s and early 1970s when enrollment standards were more egalitarian. In 1985, the World Bank estimated that enrollments in primary schools would decrease from 136 million in 1983 to 95 million in the late 1990s and that the decreased enrollment would reduce the number of teachers needed. Yet qualified teachers would continue to be in demand.

Under the Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education, primary schools were to be tuition-free and reasonably located for the convenience of children attending them; students would attend primary schools in their neighborhoods or villages. Parents paid a small fee per term for books and other expenses such as transportation, food and heating. Previously, fees were not considered a deterrent to attendance. Under the education reform, students from poor families received stipends, and state enterprises, institutions, and other sectors of society were encouraged to establish their own schools. A major concern was that scarce resources be conserved without causing enrollment to fall and without the weakening of the better schools. In particular, local governments were told not to pursue middle-school education blindly while primary school education was still developing, or to wrest money, teaching staff, and materials from primary schools.

Children usually entered primary school at seven years of age for six days a week, which after regulatory changes in 1995 and 1997 were changed to five and a half and five days, respectively. The two-semester school year consisted of 9.5 months, and began on 1 September and 1 March, with a summer vacation in July and August and a winter vacation in January and February. Urban primary schools typically divided the school week into twenty-four to twenty-seven classes of forty-five minutes each, but in the rural areas, the norm was half-day schooling, more flexible schedules, and itinerant teachers. Most primary schools had a five-year course, except in such cities as Beijing and Shanghai, and later other major cities, which had reintroduced six-year primary schools and accepted children at six and one-half years rather than seven.

The primary-school curriculum consisted of Chinese, mathematics, physical education, music, drawing, and elementary instruction in nature, history, and geography, combined with practical work experiences around the school compound. General knowledge of politics and moral training, which stressed the love of the motherland, love of the political party, and love of the people (and previously love of Chairman Mao), is another part of the curriculum. As of the early 2020s, political studies classes are an increasingly important part of the primary school curriculum, with teaching on the Communist Party&#x27;s history beginning in Kindergarten. A foreign language, often English, is introduced in about the third grade. Chinese and mathematics accounted for about 60 percent of the scheduled class time; natural science and social science accounted for about 8 percent. Putonghua (commonly spoken language) was taught in regular schools and pinyin romanization in lower grades and kindergarten.

The Ministry of Education required that all primary schools offer courses on morality and ethics. Beginning in the fourth grade, students usually had to perform productive labor two weeks per semester to relate classwork with production experience in workshops or on farms and relate it to academic study. Most schools had after-hour activities at least one day per week to involve students in recreation and community service. Between First and Third Grades, Chinese students are encouraged to join the Red Pioneers to prepare them for eventual potential membership in the Communist Party.

By 1980 the percentage of students enrolled in primary schools were high, but the schools reported high dropout rates and regional enrollment gaps (most enrollees were concentrated in the cities). Only one in four counties had universal primary education. On average, 10 percent of the students dropped out between each grade. During the 1979–83 period, the government acknowledged the &quot;9-6-3&quot; rule, that is, that nine of ten children began primary school, six completed it, and three graduated with good performance. This meant that only about 60 percent of primary students actually completed their five-year program of study and graduated, and only about 30 percent were regarded as having primary-level competence. Statistics in the mid-1980s showed that more rural girls than boys dropped out of school.

Within the framework of the &quot;Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education&quot; and the general trend toward vocational and technical skills, attempts were made to accommodate and correct the gap between urban and rural education. Urban and key schools almost invariably operated on a six-day full-time schedule to prepare students for further education and high-level jobs. Rural schools generally operated on a flexible schedule geared to the needs of the agricultural seasons and sought to prepare students for adult life and manual labor in lower-skilled jobs. They also offered a more limited curriculum, often only Chinese, mathematics, and morals. To promote attendance and allow the class schedule and academic year to be completed, agricultural seasons were taken into account. School holidays were moved, school days shortened, and full-time, half-time, and spare-time classes offered in the slack agricultural seasons. Sometimes itinerant teachers were hired for mountain villages and served one village in the morning, another village in the afternoon.

Rural parents were generally aware that their children had limited opportunities to further their education. Some parents saw little use in having their children attend even primary school, especially after the establishment of the agricultural responsibility system. Under that system, parents preferred that their children work to increase family income – and withdrew them from school – for both long and short periods of time.

===Preschool education===
Preschool education, which began at age three, was another target of education reform in 1985. Preschool facilities were to be established in buildings made available by public enterprises, production teams, municipal authorities, local groups, and families. The government announced that it depended on individual organizations to sponsor their own preschool education and that preschool education was to become a part of the welfare services of various government organizations, institutes, and state- and collectively operated enterprises. Costs for preschool education varied according to services rendered. Officials also called for more preschool teachers with more appropriate training.

===Special education===
The 1985 National Conference on Education also recognized the importance of special education, in the form of programs for gifted children and for slow learners. Gifted children were allowed to skip grades. Slow learners were encouraged to reach minimum standards, although those who did not maintain the pace seldom reached the next stage. For the most part, children with severe learning problems and those with handicaps and psychological needs were the responsibilities of their families. Extra provisions were made for blind and severely hearing-impaired children, although in 1984 special schools enrolled fewer than 2 percent of all eligible children in those categories. The China Welfare Fund, established in 1984, received state funding and had the right to solicit donations within China and from abroad, but special education has remained a low government priority.

Today, China has 1,540 schools for special education, with 375,000 students; more than 1,000 vocational training institutes for disabled people, nearly 3,000 standard vocational training and education institutes that also admit disabled people; more than 1,700 training organizations for rehabilitating hearing-impaired children, with over 100,000 trained and in-training children. In 2004, 4,112 disabled students entered ordinary schools of higher learning. Of disabled children receiving special education, 63.6 percent of total recruitment numbers and 66.2 percent of enrollment were in ordinary schools or special classes thereof.

==Secondary education==
===History===

Secondary education in China has a complicated history. In the early 1960s, education planners followed a policy called &quot;walking on two legs&quot;, which established both regular academic schools and separate technical schools for vocational training. The rapid expansion of secondary education during the Cultural Revolution created serious problems; because resources were spread too thinly, educational quality declined. Further, this expansion was limited to regular secondary schools; technical schools were closed during the Cultural Revolution because they were viewed as an attempt to provide inferior education to children of worker and peasant families.

In the late 1970s, government and party representatives criticized what they termed the &quot;unitary&quot; approach of the 1960s, arguing that it ignored the need for two kinds of graduates: those with an academic education (college preparatory) and those with specialized technical education (vocational). Beginning in 1976 with the renewed emphasis on technical training, technical schools reopened, and their enrollments increased.

In the drive to spread vocational and technical education, regular secondary-school enrollments fell. By 1986 universal secondary education was part of the nine-year compulsory education law that made primary education (six years) and junior-high-school education (three years) mandatory. The desire to consolidate existing schools and to improve the quality of key middle schools was, however, under the education reform, more important than expanding enrollment.

===Junior secondary===
Junior secondary education is more commonly known as middle school or junior high school education, it consists of the last three years of compulsory education. Students who live in rural areas are often boarded into townships to receive their education. Students take a course generally referred to as &quot;Ideological and Political Studies&quot; which emphasizes communist values and communist institutions.

===Senior secondary===

Senior secondary education often refers to three years of high school education, as from grade 10 to grade 12. Normally, students who have finished six years of primary education will continue three more years of academic study in middle schools as regulated by the Compulsory education law at the age of twelve. This is not compulsory for senior secondary education, where junior graduates may choose to continue a three-year academic education in academic high schools, which will eventually lead to university or to switch to a vocational course in vocational high schools.

Generally, high school years usually have two semesters, starting in September and February. In some rural areas, the operation may be subject to agricultural cycles. The number of lessons offered by a school every week is very subjective and largely depends on the school&#x27;s resources. In addition to normal lessons, periods for private study and extracurricular activity are provided as well. The academic curriculum consists of Chinese, Mathematics, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, Ideology &amp; Political Science, Music, Fine Arts, PE, Technology, Computing, etc. Some schools may also offer vocational subjects. Generally speaking, Chinese, Mathematics, and English are considered as three main subjects as they will definitely be examined in Gaokao. In most provinces, students also need to be examined in either natural sciences, which incorporate Physics, Chemistry and Biology, or social sciences, which incorporate Geography, History, and Ideology &amp; Political Science. Required high school political courses elaborate on Marxism, Maoism, theory contributions of subsequent leaders, and the communist institutions of China.

In China, a senior high school graduate will be considered as an educated person, although the majority of graduates will go on to universities or vocational colleges. Given that the competition for limited university places is extremely intense, most high schools are evaluated by their academic performance in Gaokao by parents and students.

====Admissions and Zhongkao====

Zhongkao (中考), the Senior High School Entrance Examination, is the academic examination held annually in China to distinguish junior graduates. Most commonly, students will be tested in Chinese, Mathematics, English, Physics, Chemistry, Political Science and PE. Scoring systems vary across regions.

Admission for senior high schools, especially selective high schools, is somewhat similar to the one for universities in China. Students will go through an application system where they may choose the high schools at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before the high schools set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and the high schools will announce their requirements based on this information and the places they will offer in that year. For instance, if the school offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. The severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most students will have sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.

There are other official rules of admission in certain top high schools. If a prestigious senior high school wants to admit 800 students a year, the admissions office ranks students&#x27; scores from highest to lowest and then selects their first 700 students. The other 100 positions are provided to the students who do not meet the required standard, but still want to study at that school. These prospects need to pay extra school fees. A student cannot perform badly in Zhongkao, if their scores are close to the required standard, they could still study in that top school if they can afford the expenses. Those who study in that high school must place a maximum of two points below the standard requirement. Usually, 0.5 points is a standard. For instance, if a student is two points below the standard requirement, they pay four times as much as the student who gets 0.5 points below the standard requirement. The admissions of the 100 students who are required to pay the school fees usually do not get the same admission letters as normal students receive, but they can still study and live with normal students in the same high school, with the same teacher.

====Vocational and technical schools====
The &quot;Law on Vocational Education&quot; was issued in 1996. Vocational education embraces higher vocational schools, secondary skill schools, vestibule schools, vocational high schools, job-finding centers, and other adult skills and social training institutes. To enable vocational education to better accommodate the demands of economic re-structuring and urbanization, in recent years the government has remodeled vocational education, oriented towards obtaining employment and focusing on two major vocational education projects to meet society&#x27;s ever more acute demand for high quality, skilled workers. These are cultivating skilled workers urgently needed in modern manufacturing and service industries, and training rural laborers moving to urban areas. To accelerate vocational education in western areas, the Central Government has used government bonds to build 186 vocational education centers in impoverished western area counties.

Both regular and vocational secondary schools sought to serve modernization needs. A number of technical and &quot;skilled-worker&quot; training schools reopened after the Cultural Revolution, and an effort was made to provide exposure to vocational subjects in general secondary schools (by offering courses in the industry, services, business, and agriculture). By 1985 there were almost 3 million vocational and technical students.

Under the educational reform tenets, polytechnic colleges were to give priority to admitting secondary vocational and technical school graduates and providing on-the-job training for qualified workers. Education reformers continued to press for the conversion of about 50 percent of upper secondary education into vocational education, which traditionally had been weak in the rural areas. Regular senior high schools were to be converted into vocational secondary schools, and vocational training classes were to be established in some senior middle schools. Diversion of students from academic to technical education was intended to alleviate skill shortages and to reduce the competition for university enrollment.

Although enrollment in technical schools of various kinds had not yet increased enough to compensate for decreasing enrollments in regular senior high schools, the proportion of vocational and technical students to total senior-high-school students increased from about 5 percent in 1978 to almost 36 percent in 1985, although development was uneven. Further, to encourage greater numbers of junior-high-school graduates to enter technical schools, vocational and technical school graduates were given priority in job assignments, while other job seekers had to take technical tests.

In 1987 there were four kinds of secondary vocational and technical schools:

# Technical schools, which offered a four-year, post-junior high course and two- to three-year post-senior high training in such fields as commerce, legal work, fine arts, and forestry;
# Workers&#x27; training schools, which accepted students whose senior-high-school education consisted of two years of training in such trades as carpentry and welding;
# Vocational technical schools, which accepted either junior-or senior-high-school students for one- to three-year courses in cooking, tailoring, photography, and other services; and
# Agricultural secondary schools, which offered basic subjects and agricultural science.

These technical schools had several hundred different programs. Their narrow specializations had advantages in that they offered in-depth training, reducing the need for on-the-job training and thereby lowering learning time and costs. Moreover, students were more motivated to study if there were links between training and future jobs. Much of the training could be done at existing enterprises, where staff and equipment was available at little additional cost.

There were some disadvantages to this system. Under the Four Modernizations, technically trained generalists were needed more than highly specialized technicians. Also, highly specialized equipment and staff were underused, and there was an overall shortage of specialized facilities to conduct training. In addition, large expenses were incurred in providing the necessary facilities and staff, and the trend in some government technical agencies was toward more general technical and vocational education.

Further, the dropout rate continued to have a negative effect on the labor pool as upper-secondary-school technical students dropped out and as the percentage of lower-secondary-school graduates entering the labor market without job training increased. Occupational rigidity and the geographic immobility of the population, particularly in rural areas, further limited educational choices.

Although there were 668,000 new polytechnic school enrollments in 1985, the Seventh Five-Year Plan called for annual increases of 2 million mid-level skilled workers and 400,000 senior technicians, indicating that enrollment levels were still far from sufficient. To improve the situation, in July 1986 officials from the State Education Commission, State Planning Commission, and Ministry of Labor and Personnel convened a national conference on developing China&#x27;s technical and vocational education. It was decided that technical and vocational education in rural areas should accommodate local conditions and be conducted on a short-term basis. Where conditions permitted, the emphasis would be placed on organizing technical schools and short-term training classes. To alleviate the shortage of teachers, vocational and technical teachers&#x27; colleges were to be reformed and other colleges and universities were to be mobilized for assistance. The State Council decided to improve training for workers who had passed technical examinations (as opposed to unskilled workers) was intended to reinforce the development of vocational and technical schools.

Expanding and improving secondary vocational education has long been an objective of China&#x27;s educational reformers, for vocational schools are seen as those which are best placed to address (by providing trained workers) the rising needs of the nation&#x27;s expanding economy, especially its manufacturing and industrial sectors. Without an educated and trained workforce, China cannot have economic, hence social and national, development. Yet, given a finite, and often quite limited, a pot of money for secondary schools, and allocation competition/conflict necessarily exists between its two sub-sectors: general education and vocational/technical education.

Regardless, an over-enrollment in the latter has been the overall result of the mid-1980s reforms. Yet firms that must seek workers from this graduate pool have remained unimpressed with the quality of recruits and have had to rely on their own job-training programs that provide re-education for their newly hired workers. The public, also, has not been very enthusiastic over vocational secondary education which, unlike general education, does not lead to the possibility of higher education. The public&#x27;s perception is that these schools provide little more than a dead end for their children. Also, vocational institutions are more expensive to run than their counterparts in general education, and they have not had sufficient money to modernize their facilities, as China&#x27;s modernizing national economy demands. By mid-decade of the 21st Century, therefore, academics and policy-makers alike began to question the policy that pours funds into vocational schools that do not do their intended function.

==Private education==
In 2021, 56,000,000 students attended 190,000 privately operated schools, with 12,000 of them having primary and/or junior high school levels. These students represent about 20% of all students in China. By 2021, the Chinese central government was nationalizing some for-profit private schools.

Private schools have pioneered cooperation with foreign partners in the running of schools and many foreign universities have entered China this way, which has both improved the quality of China&#x27;s education resources and opened new channels for students&#x27; further studies.

In January 2017, State Council of China stated that the China Communist party&#x27;s leadership over private schools should be strengthened, CCP&#x27;s organizations should be established in private schools, and the party organizations of private schools should play a political core role and firmly control the private schools&#x27; school orientation: Training socialist builders and successors.

== Supplemental classes and tutoring ==
A 2019 survey conducted by Tencent found that 88.7% of students in fourth through first tier cities took supplemental classes outside of school and that the average was 2.1 supplemental classes per student.

In 2021, the government shutdown private tutoring for schoolchildren based on the rationale that rising educational costs were antithetical to the goals of common prosperity. Shutting down private tutoring was intended to narrow the education gap between rich and poor. Rules issued in July 2021 prohibits new registration of private tuition tutoring centers and required existing centers to re-organize as non-profits. Tuition centers are prohibited from being listed on the stock market or receiving &quot;excessive capital.&quot; They are no longer permitted to offer tutoring on the weekends or during public holidays.

Nature schools () are offered by companies and organizations outside of the formal school system. These programs seek to supplement environmental education with hands-on environmental learning not typically available through schools.

==International education==

As of January 2021, SICAS –Study In China Admission System listed China as having 300 international schools. ISC defines an &#x27;international school&#x27; in the following terms: &quot;ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country&#x27;s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.&quot; This definition is used by publications including &quot;The Economist&quot;. There were 177,400 students enrolled in international schools in 2014.

2013 Nicholas Brummitt, managing director of ISC, reported that there were 338 international schools in Mainland China as of 2013, with 184,073 students. Slightly more than half of the international schools are in the major expatriate areas of China: Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong Province, while the remainder is in other areas. Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have the most international schools while significant numbers also exist in Shenzhen and Chengdu.

Many international schools in Beijing and Shanghai, in accordance with Chinese law, are only permitted to enroll students who have citizenship in areas other than Mainland China. This is because Mainland Chinese students are required to have a certain curriculum, and schools that do not include this curriculum are not permitted to enroll Mainlanders. Mainlander children who hold foreign passports are permitted to attend these schools. As of 2014, 19 international schools in Beijing are restricted to non-Mainlanders. There are also schools using international curricula that accept both Mainlander and non-Mainlander students.

By 2004, increased international business operations resulted in an increase of foreign children. Many of the original post-1949 international schools used International Baccalaureate and North American curricula. By 2004 many international schools in Beijing and Shanghai using the British curricula had opened. The number of international schools in China grew from 22 schools in 2001 to 338 schools in 2013; over the same period, enrollment in international schools rose 25 times to 184,073 students. By the 2010s, many Mainland Chinese parents began sending their children to international schools that accept Mainland students to increase their children&#x27;s chances of going overseas.

There is an increasing number of international universities representation in China in recent years, including but not limited to CEIBS and Yale Center Beijing. Columbia Global Centers Beijing opened in 2009 and Harvard Institute Shanghai opened in 2010.

Cornell University Global is planning to have presence in Beijing and Shanghai. Stanford University established an academic center in Peking University. Washington University in St. Louis established an EMBA program with Fudan University in 2002 which has since been constantly ranked as one of the best in the world.

==Higher education==

Higher education in China is the largest in the world. By the end of 2021, there were over 3,000 colleges and universities, with over 44.3 million students enrolled in mainland China and 240 million Chinese citizens having received high education. The gross rate of enrollment in schools of higher learning reached 58.42 percent in 2020.

In 2015, a tertiary education development initiative called Double First-Class Construction designed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China government, which aims to comprehensively develop elite Chinese universities into world-class institutions through developing and strengthening their individual faculty departments by the end of 2050. In 2017, the full list of Double First-Class Construction was published. 140 universities have been included in the plan and approved as Double First Class Universities, making up less than 5% of the total number of universities and colleges in China.

===Background===
The quality of higher education in modern China has changed at various times, reflecting shifts in the political policies implemented by the central government. Following the founding of the PRC, in 1949, the Chinese government&#x27;s educational focus was largely on political &quot;re-education&quot;. In periods of political upheavals, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, ideology was stressed over professional or technical competence. During the early stages of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1969), tens of thousands of college students joined Red Guard organizations, which persecuted many university faculty members as &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; and effectively closed China&#x27;s universities. When universities reopened in the early 1970s, enrollments were reduced from pre-Cultural Revolution levels, and admission was restricted to individuals who had been recommended by their work unit (&quot;danwei&quot;), possessed good political credentials, and had distinguished themselves in manual labor. In the absence of stringent and reasonably objective entrance examinations, political connections became increasingly important in securing the recommendations and political dossiers necessary to qualify for university admission. As a result, the decline in educational quality was profound. Deng Xiaoping reportedly wrote Mao Zedong in 1975 that university graduates were &quot;not even capable of reading a book&quot; in their own fields when they left the university. University faculty and administrators were demoralized by the political aspects of the university system.

Efforts made in 1975 to improve educational quality were unsuccessful. By 1980, it appeared doubtful that the politically oriented admission criteria had accomplished even the purpose of increasing enrollment of workers and peasant children. Successful candidates for university entrance were usually children of cadres and officials who used personal connections that allowed them to &quot;enter through the back door.&quot; Students from officials&#x27; families would accept the requisite minimum two-year work assignment in the countryside, often in a suburban location that allowed them to remain close to their families. Village cadres, anxious to please the parents/officials, gladly recommended these youths for university placement after the labor requirement had been met. The child of an official family was then on his or her way to a university without having the academic ability, a record of political activism, or a distinguished work record.

After the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, steps were taken to improve educational quality by establishing order and stability, calling for an end to political contention on university campuses, and expanding university enrollments. This pressure to maintain quality and minimize expenditures led to efforts both to run existing institutions more efficiently and to develop other college and university programs. As a result, labor colleges for training agro-technicians and factory-run colleges for providing technical education for workers were established. In addition, eighty-eight institutions and key universities were provided with special funding, top students and faculty members, and other support, and they recruited the most academically qualified students without regard to family background or political activism. The State Council officially reinstated the college entrance examination system on October 12, 1977, when it forwarded the &quot;Opinions on Enrollment in Higher Education in 1977&quot; to the Ministry of Education.

===Modernization goals in the 1980s===

The commitment to the Four Modernizations required great advances in science and technology. Under the modernization program, higher education was to be the cornerstone for training and research. Because modernization depended on a vastly increased and improved capability to train scientists and engineers for needed breakthroughs, the renewed concern for higher education and academic quality – and the central role that the sciences were expected to play in the Four Modernizations – highlighted the need for scientific research and training. This concern can be traced to the critical personnel shortages and qualitative deficiencies in the sciences resulting from the unproductive years of the Cultural Revolution when higher education was shut down. In response to the need for scientific training, the Sixth Plenum of the Twelfth National Party Congress Central Committee, held in September 1986, adopted a resolution on the guiding principles for building a socialist society that strongly emphasized the importance of education and science.

Reformers realized that the higher education system was far from meeting modernization goals and that additional changes were needed. The Provisional Regulations Concerning the Management of Institutions of Higher Learning, promulgated by the State Council in 1986, initiated vast changes in administration and adjusted educational opportunity, direction, and content. With the increased independence accorded under the education reform, universities and colleges were able to choose their own teaching plans and curricula; to accept projects from or cooperate with other socialist establishments for scientific research and technical development in setting up &quot;combines&quot; involving teaching, scientific research, and production; to suggest appointments and removals of vice presidents and other staff members; to take charge of the distribution of capital construction investment and funds allocated by the state, and to be responsible for the development of international exchanges by using their own funds.

The changes also allowed the universities to accept financial aid from work units and decide how this money was to be used without asking for more money from departments in charge of education. Further, higher education institutions and work units could sign contracts for the training of students.

Higher education institutions also were assigned a greater role in running inter-regional and inter-departmental schools. Within their state-approved budgets, universities secured more freedom to allocate funds as they saw fit and to use the income from tuition and technical and advisory services for their own development, including collective welfare and bonuses.

There also was a renewed interest in television, radio, and correspondence classes (see distance learning and electronic learning). Some of the courses, particularly in the college-run factories, were serious, full-time enterprises, with a two- to three-year curriculum.

====Entrance examinations and admission criteria====
National examinations to select students for higher education (and positions of leadership) were an important part of China&#x27;s culture, and, traditionally, entrance to a higher education institution is considered prestigious. Although the examination system for admission to colleges and universities has undergone many changes since the Cultural Revolution, it remains the basis for recruiting academically able students. When higher education institutions were reopened in the early 1970s, candidates for entrance examinations had to be senior-middle-school graduates or the equivalent, generally below twenty-six years of age. Work experience requirements were eliminated, but workers and staff members needed permission from their enterprises to take the examinations.

Each provincial-level unit was assigned a quota of students to be admitted to key universities, the second quota of students for regular universities within that administrative division, and a third quota of students from other provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities who would be admitted to institutions operated at the provincial level. Provincial-level administrative units selected students with outstanding records to take the examinations. Additionally, preselection examinations were organized by the provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities for potential students (from three to five times the number of places allotted). These candidates were actively encouraged to take the examination to ensure that a sufficient number of good applicants would be available. Cadres with at least two years of work experience were recruited for selected departments in a small number of universities on an experimental basis. Preferential admission treatment (in spite of lower test scores) was given to minority candidates, students from disadvantaged areas, and those who agreed in advance to work in less developed regions after graduation.

In December 1977, when uniform national examinations were reinstated, 5.7 million students took the examinations, although university placement was available for only the 273,000 applicants with the highest scores. The admission rate of 4.8% was the lowest in the history of Chinese higher education, the admitted students are known as the Class of 1977. In July 1984, about 1.6 million candidates (30,000 fewer than in 1983) took the entrance examinations for the 430,000 places in China&#x27;s more than 900 colleges and universities. Of the 1.6 million examinees, more than 1 million took the test for placement in science and engineering colleges; 415,000 for places in liberal arts colleges; 88,000 for placement in foreign language institutions; and 15,000 for placement in sports universities and schools. More than 100,000 of the candidates were from national minority groups. A year later, there were approximately 1.8 million students taking the three-day college entrance examination to compete for 560,000 places. Liberal arts candidates were tested on politics, Chinese, mathematics, foreign languages, history, and geography. Science and engineering candidates were tested on politics, Chinese, mathematics, chemistry, and biology. Entrance examinations also were given in 1985 for professional and technical schools, which sought to enroll 550,000 new students.

Other innovations in enrollment practices, included allowing colleges and universities to admit students with good academic records but relatively low entrance-examination scores. Some colleges were allowed to try an experimental student recommendation system – fixed at 2 percent of the total enrollment for regular colleges and 5 percent for teachers&#x27; colleges – instead of the traditional entrance examination. A minimum national examination score was established for admission to specific departments at specially designated colleges and universities, and the minimum score for admission to other universities was set by provincial-level authorities. Key universities established separate classes for minorities. When several applicants attained the minimum test score, the school had the option of making a selection, a policy that gave university faculty and administrators a certain amount of discretion but still protected admission according to academic ability.

In addition to the written examination, university applicants had to pass a physical examination and a political screening. Less than 2 percent of the students who passed the written test were eliminated for reasons of poor health. The number disqualified for political reasons was known, but publicly the party maintained that the number was very small and that it sought to ensure that only the most able students actually entered colleges and universities.

By 1985 the number of institutions of higher learning had again increased – to slightly more than 1,000. The State Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance issued a joint declaration for nationwide unified enrollment of adult students – not the regular secondary-school graduates but the members of the workforce who qualified for admission by taking a test. The State Education Commission established unified questions and time and evaluation criteria for the test and authorized provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities to administer the test, grade the papers in a uniform manner, and determine the minimum points required for admission. The various schools were to enroll students according to the results. Adult students needed to have the educational equivalent of senior-middle-school graduates, and those applying for release or partial release from work to study were to be under forty years of age. Staff members and workers were to apply to study job-related subjects with review by and approval of their respective work units. If employers paid for the college courses, the workers had to take entrance examinations. In 1985 colleges enrolled 33,000 employees from various enterprises and companies, approximately 6 percent of the total college enrollment.

In 1985 state quotas for university places were set, allowing both for students sponsored by institutions and for those paying their own expenses. This policy was a change from the previous system in which all students were enrolled according to guidelines established in Beijing. All students except those at military school or police academy, those who had financial difficulties, and those who were to work under adverse conditions after graduation had to pay for their own tuition, accommodations, and miscellaneous expenses.

====Changes in enrollment and assignment policies====
The children enrollment and graduate assignment system also were changed to reflect more closely the personnel needs of modernization. By 1986 the state was responsible for drafting the enrollment plan, which took into account future personnel demands, the need to recruit students from outlying regions, and the needs of trades and professions with adverse working conditions. Moreover, a certain number of graduates to be trained for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army were included in the state enrollment plan. In most cases, enrollment in higher education institutions at the employers&#x27; request was extended as a supplement to the state student enrollment plan. Employers were to pay a percentage of training fees, and students were to fulfill contractual obligations to the employers after graduation. The small number of students who attended colleges and universities at their own expense could be enrolled in addition to those in the state plan.

Accompanying the changes in enrollment practices were reforms (adopted 1986) in the faculty appointment system, which ended the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; employment system and permitted colleges and universities to decide which academic departments, which academic majors, and how many teachers they needed. Teachers in institutions of higher learning were hired on a basis, usually for two to four years at a time. The teaching positions available on basis were teaching assistant, lecturer, associate professor, and professor. The system was tested in eight major universities in Beijing and Shanghai before it was instituted nationwide at the end of 1985. University presidents headed groups in charge of appointing professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants according to their academic levels and teaching abilities, and a more rational wage system, geared to different job levels, was inaugurated. Universities and colleges with surplus professors and researchers were advised to grant them appropriate academic titles and encourage them to work for their current pay in schools of higher learning where they were needed. The new system was to be extended to schools of all kinds and other education departments within two years.

Under the 1985 reforms, all graduates were assigned jobs by the state; a central government placement agency told the schools where to send graduates. By 1985 Tsinghua University and a few other universities were experimenting with a system that allowed graduates to accept job offers or to look for their own positions. For example, of 1,900 Tsinghua University graduates in 1985, 1,200 went on to graduate school, 48 looked for their own jobs, and the remainder were assigned jobs by the school after consultation with the students. The college students and postgraduates scheduled to graduate in 1986 were assigned primarily to work in forestry, education, textiles, and the armaments industry. Graduates still were needed in civil engineering, computer science, and finance.

====Scholarship and loan system====
In July 1986 the State Council announced that the stipend system for university and college students would be replaced with a new scholarship and loan system. The new system, to be tested in selected institutions during the 1986–87 academic year, was designed to help students who could not cover their own living expenses but who studied hard, obeyed state laws, and observed discipline codes. Students eligible for financial aid were to apply to the schools and the China Industrial and Commercial Bank for low-interest loans. Three categories of students eligible for aid were established: top students encouraged to attain all-around excellence; students specializing in education, agriculture, forestry, sports, and marine navigation; and students willing to work in poor, remote, and border regions or under harsh conditions, such as in mining and engineering. In addition, free tuition and board were to be offered at military school, and the graduates were required to join the army for at least five years in relevant positions. For those who worked in an approved rural position after graduation, student loans would be paid off by his or her employer, such as a school, in a lump sum. And the money was to be repaid to the employer by the student through five years of payroll deductions.

====Study abroad====
In addition to loans, another means of raising educational quality, particularly in science, was to send students abroad to study. A large number of Chinese students studied in the Soviet Union before educational links and other cooperative programs with the Soviet Union were severed in the late 1950s (see Sino-Soviet split). In the 1960s and 1970s, China continued to send a small number of students abroad, primarily to European universities. In October 1978 Chinese students began to arrive in the United States; their numbers accelerated after normalization of relations between the two countries in January 1979, a policy consistent with modernization needs. Although figures vary, more than 36,000 students, including 7,000 self-supporting students (those who paid their own way, received scholarships from host institutions, or received help from relatives and &quot;foreign friends&quot;), studied in 14 countries between 1978 and 1984. Of this total, 78 percent were technical personnel sent abroad for advanced study. As of mid-1986, there were 15,000 Chinese scholars and graduates in American universities, compared with a total of 19,000 scholars sent between 1979 and 1983.

Chinese students sent to the United States generally were not typical undergraduates or graduate students but were mid-career scientists, often thirty-five to forty-five years of age, seeking advanced training in their areas of specialization. Often they were individuals of exceptional ability who occupied responsible positions in Chinese universities and research institutions. Fewer than 15 percent of the earliest arrivals were degree candidates. Nearly all the visiting scholars were in scientific fields.

Multiple opinion studies have shown that the longer Chinese students study abroad, the better their view of China becomes. According to the Ministry of Education approximately 86% of students who completed their studies abroad between 2000 and 2019 returned to China.

==== Educational investment ====
Many of the problems that had hindered higher educational development in the past continued in 1987. Funding remained a major problem because science and technology study and research and study abroad were expensive. Because education was competing with other modernization programs, the capital was critically short. Another concern was whether or not the Chinese economy was sufficiently advanced to make efficient use of the highly trained technical personnel it planned to educate. For example, some observers believed that it would be more realistic to train a literate workforce of low-level technicians instead of research scientists. Moreover, it was feared that using an examination to recruit the most able students might advance people who were merely good at taking examinations. Educational reforms also made some people uncomfortable by criticizing the traditional practice of rote memorization and promoting innovative teaching and study methods.

The prestige associated with higher education caused a demand for it. But many qualified youths were unable to attend colleges and universities because China could not finance enough university places for them. To help meet the demand and to educate a highly trained, specialized workforce, China established alternate forms of higher education – such as spare-time, part-time, and radio and television universities.

China could not afford a heavy investment, either ideologically or financially, in the education of a few students. Since 1978 China&#x27;s leaders have modified the policy of concentrating education resources at the university level, which, although designed to facilitate modernization, conflicted directly with the party&#x27;s principles. The policies that produced an educated elite also siphoned off resources that might have been used to accomplish the compulsory nine-year education more speedily and to equalize educational opportunities in the city and the countryside. The policy of key schools has been modified over the years. Nevertheless, China&#x27;s leaders believe an educated elite is necessary to reach modernization goals. Corruption has been increasingly problematic for rural schools. Because the educational funding is distributed from the top down, each layer of bureaucracy has tended to siphon off more than its share of funding, leaving too little for the bottom rural level.

Families have had to cover for government indifference by making personal investments in their children&#x27;s education. Chinese economy may not be able to effectively absorb the resulting influx of college graduates, who may need to settle for lower paying jobs, if they can find those.

===Reform in the 21st century===

In 1998 the Chinese government proposed to expand the university enrollment of professional and specialized graduates and to develop world-class universities.

In the spring of 2007, China planned to conduct a national evaluation of its universities. The results of this evaluation are used to support the next major planned policy initiative. The last substantial national evaluation of universities, which was undertaken in 1994, resulted in the &#x27;massification&#x27; of higher education as well as a renewed emphasis on elite institutions. Academics praised the &quot;fin du siècle&quot; reforms for budging China&#x27;s higher education from a unified, centralized, closed and static system into one characterized by more diversification, decentralization, openness, and dynamism, stimulating the involvement of local governments and other non-state sectors. At the same time, they note that this decentralization and marketization has led to further inequality in educational opportunity.

Chinese policies on College Entrance Examination have been influenced by the recruitment systems of western countries and the traditional culture of imperial examinations. Since Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University started independent enrollment before College Entrance Examination in 2007, some of the top Chinese colleges began to follow them using a new method to choose students besides a unified examination system. In accordance with university regulations, those colleges appoint their own staff and are responsible for selecting students. Students can get admitted by taking a specific exam or interview before the College Entrance Examination. In this way, students have more chances to get admitted by the top colleges. In 2010, there were several critical reforms in the education field. On 31 January, the education ministry in Guangdong province began to implement parallel voluntary admission in the college entrance recruiting system, which is an efficient way to decrease the risk of getting into a college for the majority of students. On 20 November, the education ministry of China canceled the additional Olympics points in the College Entrance Exam policy. It is fairer for the high school students, and efficiently reduces the heavy academic burdens for students. As the economic development of China, the private school system has been gradually built up. Many private preschools began to use bilingual teaching. Furthermore, some public colleges and universities cooperated with investors to run secondary college by using public running and being sponsored by private enterprises, which promotes the development of education. On the other hand, the Technical and Vocational Education in China has developed rapidly, and become the focus of the whole society.

Nowadays, as the educational level of Chinese has increased, getting into college is no longer a remarkable achievement among the Chinese students. Instead, having a degree of an ordinary Chinese university already cannot satisfy the increasingly competitive society. Chinese parents and students have begun to place a high value on overseas education, especially at top American and European institutions such as Harvard University, Oxford University, and Cambridge University, which are &quot;revered&quot; among many middle-class parents. Since 1999, the number of Chinese applicants to top schools overseas has increased tenfold. Much of the interest in overseas schools has been attributed to the release of how-to parenting books such as &quot;Harvard Girl&quot;, which spawned a &quot;national obsession&quot; with admissions to overseas schools. After 2005, the number of overseas students from China not only showed a growth trend, but also presented a lowering trend of age.

With more students going abroad for university, increasing numbers of affluent families are &quot;opting out&quot; of the conventional public school system, which is heavily oriented towards preparing for the Chinese college admissions test. These families, who can afford tuition at a foreign university and may prefer a more &quot;western&quot; education for their children, are sending their children to private schools, special programs within Chinese public schools, or schools abroad. Some of the prestige of American higher education is the result of weaknesses in the PRC&#x27;s education system, which stifles creativity in favor of rote memorization.

As a result of the growing mismatch between university degrees and job opportunities in China, university students are also increasingly undertaking extracurricular educational training during their time in university. These include university clubs, volunteering activities, and internships. Furthermore, the Chinese state has promoted entrepreneurship among university students by running business training, setting up &quot;business incubators&quot; on campuses, and offering special benefits for student entrepreneurs. As a result of this development, university life in China has become associated with various aspects of &quot;self-development&quot; in addition to formal classroom learning.

During Xi Jinping&#x27;s tenure, numerous colleges and universities have established schools of Marxism. In 2012, there were about a hundred such schools nationwide; as of 2021, there were more than 1,440. Master&#x27;s degree and Doctoral programs in Marxism have increased significantly since 2016.

Beginning in 2017, Chinese universities and regional governments have begun establishing centers for the study of Xi Jinping Thought on ecological civilization. At least 18 such centers had been established as of 2021.

In 2024, the textbook &quot;An Introduction to the Community of the Zhonghua Race&quot; (中华民族共同体概论) was rolled out and made compulsory for all university students in the country. Edited by Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, the textbook advocates for further integration of the country&#x27;s ethnic minorities and criticizes prior policies of &quot;ethnic minority exceptionalism.&quot;

=== Overseas students ===
The number of foreigners wanting to study in China has been rising by approximately 20% annually since the reform and opening period began. China has been the most popular country in Asia for international students, and as of 2018, it was the second most popular education powerhouse in the world after the United States.

According to reports, South Korea, Japan, the United States, Vietnam, and Thailand were the five biggest source countries, and the number of students from European source countries is increasing. Currently the Chinese government offers over 10,000 scholarships to foreign students, though this is set to rise by approximately 3,000 within the next year.

International students are increasingly studying in China. China&#x27;s economy is improving more quickly than had been predicted, i.e. sizable economic growth by 2015 has been predicted as opposed to 2050. China has already drawn the attention of the West for its growth rates, and the 2008 Olympic Games and Shanghai Expo 2010 have intensified this positive attention. Another factor that draws students to China is the considerably lower cost of living in China compared to most western countries. Finally, major cities in China such as Beijing and Shanghai already have a strong international presence. Nevertheless, unlike in many Western countries, possibilities to legally engage in internships and part-time work are limited and remain within a grey area although national legislation has tried to clarify the matter.

=== Rankings and reputation ===

Currently, China has around 3,012 colleges and universities. The quality of universities and higher education in China is internationally recognized as the country has the world&#x27;s highest number of universities in several rankings, including the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), the U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking, the University Ranking by Academic Performance, the CWTS Leiden Ranking, and the SCImago Institutions Rankings.

As of 2023, China tops the list for the first time for the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) and the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Global Universities Ranking 2022–2023, two of the fourth most observed global university rankings apart from the QS and THE.

China has dominated the QS BRICS University Rankings and the THE&#x27;s Emerging Economies University Rankings, claiming seven of the top 10 spots for both rankings. China is also the most-represented nation overall. In 2020, China tops the QS Asia University Rankings list with over 120 universities including in the ranking, and five Chinese universities appear in the Asia Top 10, which is more than any country. As of 2024. there were 18 Chinese universities on lists of the global top 200 behind only the United States and the United Kingdom in terms of the overall representation in the &quot;Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities&quot;, a composite ranking system combining three of the world&#x27;s most influential university rankings (ARWU+QS+ THE).

According to THE China Subject Ratings 2020 conducted by the Time Higher Education World University Rankings, Chinese universities are on a par with their counterparts in the US, the UK, and Germany across 89 subjects ahead of others like France, South Korea, and Russia. The country scores above the global average of B score, with 46 percent of its universities&#x27; grades were A+, A, or A−, only slightly behind the US (49 percent). The QS ranking by subjects 2021indicated that universities in China now have a record number in the top 50 universities in the world across all 51 subjects in five broad discipline areas: &quot;Arts and Humanities&quot;, &quot;Natural Sciences&quot;, &quot;Social Sciences and Management&quot;, &quot;Engineering &amp; Technology&quot;, and &quot;Life Sciences and Medicines&quot;.

This reflects the continual development of Chinese higher education and research quality of universities over time. Regardless of different rankings about universities in China, the Ministry of Education of China does not advocate or recognize any ranking conducted by a third party.

Leading universities in the C9 League such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Zhejiang University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University have already gained international reputation for outstanding teaching and research facilities. China has signed agreements with almost 54 countries such as Germany, Great Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada and Russia on mutual recognition of higher education qualifications and academic degrees. Many Chinese universities such as United International College now offer degrees in English enabling students with no knowledge of the Chinese language to study there.

== Adult education ==

Because only 4 percent of the nation&#x27;s secondary education graduates are admitted to universities, China has found it necessary to develop other ways of meeting the demand for education. Adult education has become increasingly important in helping China meet its modernization goals. Adult, or &quot;nonformal&quot;, education is an alternative form of higher education that encompasses radio, television, and correspondence universities, spare-time and part-time universities, factory-run universities for staff and workers, and county-run universities for peasants, many operating primarily during students&#x27; off-work hours. These alternative forms of education are economical. They had sought to educate both the &quot;delayed generation&quot; – those who lost educational opportunities during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) – and to raise the cultural, scientific, and general education levels of workers on the job. The primary purpose of adult education is to provide a second chance for those who are poor in society or who have lost access to education for other reasons in order to achieve social justice and equal access to education. In the 1960s, the idea of &quot;lifelong education&quot; was raised, and began the transition of Chinese education. Adult education begins focusing on the cultivation of social responsibility to develop lifelong education theory.

=== History of adult education ===
In 1949, the common program formulated by the first session of the Chinese people&#x27;s political consultative conference (CPPCC) clearly confirmed that China needed to put emphasis on the education of the working class. It addressed the serious situation of illiteracy, which was then more than 80 percent of the population. The period from 1949 to 1966 marked the beginning and development of adult education in new China. From 1966 to 1976, adult education could not be carried out normally due to the impact of the ten-year &quot;cultural revolution&quot;. Since 1978, when China entered the new era of modernization, adult education has been rapidly restored and developed.

===Forms===
Schools have been established by government departments, businesses, trade unions, academic societies, democratic parties, and other organizations. In 1984 about 70 percent of China&#x27;s factories and enterprises supported their own part-time classes, which often were referred to as workers&#x27; colleges. In Beijing alone, more than ninety adult-education schools with night schools enrolled tens of thousands of students. More than 20,000 of these students graduated annually from evening universities, workers&#x27; colleges, television universities, and correspondence schools – more than twice the number graduating from regular colleges and universities. The government spent 200 yuan (¥) to ¥500 per adult education student and at least ¥1,000 per regular university student. In 1984 approximately 1.3 million students enrolled in television, correspondence, and evening universities, about a 30 percent increase over 1983.

Spare-time education for workers and peasants and literacy classes for the entire adult population were other components of basic education. Spare-time education included a very broad range of educational activities at all levels. Most spare-time schools were sponsored by factories and run for their own workers; they provided fairly elementary education, as well as courses to upgrade technical skills. Most were on-the-job training and retraining courses, a normal part of any industrial system. These schools continually received publicity in the domestic media as a symbol of social justice, but it was unclear whether they received adequate resources to achieve this end.

China&#x27;s educational television system began in 1960 but was suspended during the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In 1979 the Central Radio and Television University was established in Beijing with branches in twenty-eight provincial-level universities. Many Central Radio and Television University students were recent senior-middle school graduates who scored just below the cut-off point for admission to conventional colleges and universities. Full-time (who take four courses) and part-time students (two courses) had at least two years&#x27; work experience, and they return to their jobs after graduation. Spare-time students (one course) studied after work. Students whose work units granted them permission to study in a television university were paid their normal wages; expenses for most of their books and other educational materials were paid for by the state. A typical Central Radio and Television University student spent up to six hours a day over a three-year period watching lectures on videotapes produced by some of the best teachers in China. These lectures were augmented by face-to-face tutoring by local instructors and approximately four hours of homework each evening. The major problem with the system is that there were too few television sets. In 1987 the Central Television and Radio University had its programs produced, transmitted, and financed by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. The State Education Commission developed its curriculum and distributed its printed support materials. The curriculum included both basic, general-purpose courses in science and technology and more specialized courses. The Central Television and Radio University offered more than 1,000 classes in Beijing and its suburbs and 14 majors in 2- to 3-year courses through 56 working centers. Students who passed final examinations were given certificates entitling them to the same level of remuneration as graduates of regular, full-time colleges and universities. The state gave certain allowances to students awaiting jobs during their training period.

===Literacy and language reform===

The continuing campaigns to eradicate illiteracy also were a part of basic education. Chinese government statistics indicated that of a total population of nearly 1.1 billion in 1985, about 230 million people were illiterate or semiliterate. The difficulty of mastering written Chinese makes raising the literacy rate particularly difficult. In general, language reform was intended to make writing and the standard language easier to learn, which in turn would foster both literacy and linguistic unity and serve as a foundation for a simpler written language. In 1951 the party issued a directive that inaugurated a three-part plan for language reform. The plan sought to establish universal comprehension of a standardized common language, simplify written characters, and introduce, where possible, romanized forms based on the Latin alphabet. In 1956 Putonghua (Modern Standard Chinese) was introduced as the language of instruction in schools and in the national broadcast media, and by 1977 it was in use throughout China, particularly in the government and party, and in education. Although in 1987 the government continued to endorse the goal of universalizing Putonghua, hundreds of regional and local dialects continued to be spoken, complicating interregional communication.

A second language reform required the simplification of ideographs because ideographs with fewer strokes are easier to learn. In 1964 the Committee for Reforming the Chinese Written Language released an official list of 2,238 simplified characters most basic to the language. Simplification made literacy easier, although some people taught only in simplified characters were cut off from the wealth of Chinese literature written in traditional characters. Any idea of replacing the ideographic script with the romanized script was soon abandoned by government and education leaders.

The third area of change involved the proposal to use the pinyin romanization system more widely. Pinyin (first approved by the National People&#x27;s Congress in 1958) was encouraged primarily to facilitate the spread of Putonghua in regions where other dialects and languages are spoken. By the mid-1980s, the use of pinyin was not as widespread as the use of Putonghua.

Literacy campaigns and the differences in funding actually increased the differences in literacy rates in the city and the countryside. Retaining literacy was as much a problem as acquiring it, particularly among the rural population. Literacy rates declined between 1966 and 1976. The political disorder may have contributed to the decline, but the basic problem was that the many Chinese ideographs can be mastered only through rote learning and can be often forgotten because of disuse.

=== Types ===
With the development of the education system in China, the government gradually began to pay attention to adult education, instituting three types of adult education: Adult college entrance examinations, higher education self-taught examinations, and open education and network education (distance education).

There is only one college entrance exam every year, typically in the middle of October. Adult college entrance classes are usually held on weeknights or weekends.

Adult self-taught exams are open to all adults and does not require a certificate of formal schooling to participate. The only requirement is possession of a valid ID card. Candidates can take the exam by studying various subjects on their own or enroll in courses which are organized by universities or junior colleges.

Compared with traditional academic education, open education is a new teaching model that combines traditional face-to-face teaching, textbook autonomous learning, and online real-time courses and online classes.

Network education is taught through a network course. The study style is convenient, suits adults with busy jobs and do not have a fixed time to attend a class. Enrollment time is relatively loose, divided into spring and autumn admission. The examination time is also quite open, every month having an entrance examination.

==Online education==

The participation of big investors in online education has made it a new hotspot for investment in the education industry. Students of remote and under-developed areas are the biggest beneficiaries of online education, but online universities offer students who failed university entrance examinations and working people the chance of lifelong education and learning.

The Ministry of Education has approved 68 ordinary schools of higher learning and the Central Radio and TV University to pilot modern distance education. By the end of 2003, these schools had established 2,027 off-campus learning centers around China, offering 140 majors in ten disciplines, and had a total enrollment of 1.373 million.

The gradual spread of broadband technology has also helped online education. The China Education and Research Network (CERNET), started in 1994, is now China&#x27;s second largest Internet network, covering all major cities of China. The high-speed connection between it and the China Education Broadband Satellite Net opened in 2000, established a &quot;space to earth&quot; transmission platform for modern distance education, and provided an all-round network supporting environment for distance education.

== Information and communications technology (ICT) ==
In 2010, the Government of China released its medium and long term national ICT in education master plans, which stated explicitly that ICT would have a historic impact on the development of education and called for a strong emphasis on ICT in education. In order to realize the scientific and orderly development of ICT in education, China has developed a holistic and top-down approach. The Ten Year Development Plan for ICT in Education 2011–2020 was formalized in 2012. It states that by 2020, all adults will have access to quality education resources in an ICT-enabling environment, an ICT support service system for the learning society will take shape, and all regions and schools at all levels will have broadband internet access.

In order to considerably enhance Internet coverage and transmission capacity, China has accelerated its drive to upgrade infrastructure, including the China Education and Research Network (CERNet) and China Education Broadband Satellite (CEBSat), which are the two main education networks.

To enhance the impact of ICT in education and teaching, China has placed a strong focus on developing quality digital educational resources. In particular, China has launched the &quot;one teacher, one quality lesson, and one class one quality teacher&quot; initiative, which has led to the creation of quality digital teaching resources for 3.26 million teachers. In tandem, the Chinese Government has encouraged higher education institutions to develop MOOCs, and private companies to develop basic digital resources to supplement formal educational materials.

To enhance the modernization of education governance, China has promoted ICT in education administration through the establishment of a national data center and the implementation of the national service system for education decision-making. China has also set up a national data center supporting the administration through a unique online identity number for each student, each teacher, and each school.

In an effort to promote the widespread application of ICT in teaching, China has carried out full-scale capacity training for teachers. China has launched a capacity improvement project targeting primary and secondary school teachers&#x27; capacity to use ICT, helping them to integrate ICT into their teaching. ICT training for education administrators has also been stepped up, so as to enhance their ICT leadership capability.

==Teachers==
In 1985, the government designated 10 September as Teachers&#x27; Day, the first festival day for any profession, and indicative of government efforts to raise the social status and living standards of teachers.

The government has started the Nationwide Program of Network for Education of Teachers to improve the quality of teaching. It aims to modernize teachers&#x27; education through educational information, providing support and services for lifelong learning through the teachers&#x27; education network, TV satellite network, and the Internet and to greatly improve the teaching quality of elementary and high school faculty through large-scale, high-quality and high-efficiency training and continuous education.

As required by state law, local governments are implementing teacher qualification systems and promoting in-service training for large numbers of school principals, so as to further improve school management standards. Currently, in schools of higher learning, professors and assistant professors account for 9.5 percent and 30 percent respectively. Young and middle-aged teachers predominate; teachers under age 45 account for 79 percent of total faculty, and under age 35 for 46 percent. Teachers in higher education constitute a vital contingent in scientific research, knowledge innovation, and sci-tech. Of all academicians in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 40.7 percent (280) are in the higher education sector; for the Chinese Academy of Engineering the corresponding figure is 35.3 percent (234).

Among the most pressing problems facing education reformers was the scarcity of qualified teachers, which has led to serious stunting of educational development. In 1986 there were about 8 million primary- and middle-school teachers in China, but many lacked professional training. Estimates indicated that in order to meet the goals of the Seventh Five-Year Plan and realize compulsory 9-year education, the system needed 1 million new teachers for primary schools, 750,000 new teachers for junior middle schools, and 300,000 new teachers for senior middle schools.

To cope with the shortage of qualified teachers, the State Education Commission decreed in 1985 that senior-middle-school teachers should be graduates with two years&#x27; training in professional institutes and that primary-school teachers should be graduates of secondary schools. To improve teacher quality, the commission established full-time and part-time (the latter preferred because it was less costly) in-service training programs. Primary-school and preschool in-service teacher training programs devoted 84 percent of the time to subject teaching, 6 percent to pedagogy, and psychology, and 10 percent to teaching methods. In-service training for primary-school teachers was designed to raise them to a level of approximately two years&#x27; postsecondary study, with the goal of qualifying most primary-school teachers by 1990. Secondary-school in-service teacher training was based on a unified model, tailored to meet local conditions, and offered on a spare-time basis. Ninety-five percent of its curricula were devoted to subject teaching, 2 to 3 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 2 to 3 percent to teaching methods. There was no similar large-scale in-service effort for technical and vocational teachers, most of whom worked for enterprises and local authorities.

By 1985 there were more than 1,000 teacher training schools – an indispensable tool in the effort to solve the acute shortage of qualified teachers. These schools, however, were unable to supply the number of teachers needed to attain modernization goals through 1990. Although a considerable number of students graduated as qualified teachers from institutions of Higher Learning, the relatively low social status and salary levels of teachers hampered recruitment, and not all of the graduates of teachers&#x27; colleges became teachers. To attract more teachers, China tried to make teaching a more desirable and respected profession. To this end, the government designated 10 September as Teachers&#x27; Day, granted teachers pay raises, and made teachers&#x27; colleges tuition free. To further arrest the teacher shortage, in 1986 the central government sent teachers to underdeveloped regions to train local schoolteachers.

Because urban teachers continued to earn more than their rural counterparts and because academic standards in the countryside had dropped, it remained difficult to recruit teachers for rural areas. Teachers in rural areas also had production responsibilities for their plots of land, which took time from their teaching. Rural primary teachers needed to supplement their pay by farming because most were paid by the relatively poor local communities rather than by the state.

== School uniforms ==

Many schools in China require the use of a school uniform until college. Students have uniforms for both sportswear and their daily uniform, both of which will change depending on the season. Uniforms can also differ in design depending on the school, making it easy for people to identify which school a student attends. Proponents of school uniforms argue that the uniforms are a unique form of culture, remove the pressure of students comparing clothing, and allow the faculty and others to identify students and their respective schools. In an article for &quot;China Daily&quot;, Yuan Can stated that while student uniforms were previously regarded as a sign of progress, in current society the uniform&#x27;s style is seen instead as a sign of identity and belonging.

==Issues==
The intensity of competition in education is a source of national angst. Although cities like Shanghai regularly perform highly in international assessments, Chinese education has both native and international detractors; common areas of criticism include its intense rigor; its emphasis on memorization and standardized testing, which can discourage innovation and independent thinking; and the gap in quality of education between regions and genders.

===Stress on memorization and rigour===
In 2014, Jonathan Kaiman of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Chinese parents and educators &quot;see their own system as corrupt, dehumanizing, pressurized and unfair&quot;; he went on to discuss the country&#x27;s college admission exam (called the &quot;gaokao&quot;), writing that &quot;many parents consider the grueling nine-hour test a sorting mechanism that will determine the trajectory of their children&#x27;s lives.&quot;

===Regional inequality===

In 2014, Helen Gao of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called China&#x27;s educational system &quot;cutthroat&quot; and wrote that its positive reputation among admirers is largely built on a myth: While China has phenomenally expanded basic education for its people, quadrupling its output of college graduates in the past decade, it has also created a system that discriminates against its less wealthy and well-connected citizens, thwarting social mobility at every step with bureaucratic and financial barriers. A huge gap in educational opportunities between students from rural areas and those from cities is one of the main culprits. Some 60 million students in rural schools are &#x27;left-behind&#x27; children, cared for by their grandparents as their parents seek work in faraway cities. While many of their urban peers attend schools equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and well-trained teachers, rural students often huddle in decrepit school buildings and struggle to grasp advanced subjects such as English and chemistry amid a dearth of qualified instructors. &quot;Rural students stand virtually no chance when competing academically with their urban counterparts,&quot; Jiang Nengjie, a friend and independent filmmaker who made a documentary on the left-behind children, told me. In 2014, Lara Farrar argued in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; that the disabled are &quot;shortchanged&quot; in Chinese schools, with very little chance of acceptance into higher educational institutions.

Reflecting the fact that most of China&#x27;s population lives in the countryside, 95.2 percent of all elementary schools, 87.6 percent of junior high schools and 71.5 percent of senior high schools are in rural areas, with 160 million students at the compulsory education stage. The 1995–2000 &quot;National Project of Compulsory Education in Impoverished Areas&quot; involved the allocation of 3.9 billion special funds from the central finance and 10 billion yuan raised by local governments to improve schooling conditions in impoverished areas. In 2004, various special funds allocated by the central finance for compulsory education in rural areas reached 10 billion yuan, a 72.4 percent increase on the 2003 figure of 5.8 billion.

The China Agricultural Broadcast and Television School has nearly 3,000 branch schools and a teaching and administrative staff of 46,000. Using radio, television, satellite, network, audio, and video materials, it has trained over 100 million people in applicable agricultural technologies and over 8 million persons for work in rural areas. After 20 years in development, it is the world&#x27;s largest distance learning organ for rural education.

In a Ministry of Education program covering the next five years , the government will implement measures to realize its aims of nine-year compulsory education in China&#x27;s western region and the basic elimination of young and middle-aged illiteracy and the popularization of high level, high quality nine-year compulsory education in the east and central rural areas. At the same time, the government is to promote the development of modern distance learning for rural elementary and high schools and further improve rural compulsory education management systems.

===Gender inequality===
Although gender inequality in the context of education has lessened considerably in the last thirty years, the rapid economic growth China experienced during that time created uneven growth across regions of the country. Language barriers among minority populations, as well as drastic differences in regional laws governing school attendance, contribute to the differing levels of gender equality in education.
A 2010 statement by UNESCO stated that in China it is &quot;necessary to articulate a strategy to improve girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s participation, retention and achievement in education at all levels,&quot; and that education should be &quot;seen as an instrument for the empowerment of women.&quot;

===Academic censorship===

Academic publications and speeches in China are subjected to the censorship of Chinese authorities.

==== Textbook examination, approval, and censorship ====
Education is a significant part of the Chinese political system and is tightly controlled by the central government. China&#x27;s ruling party – the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) – tightly controls teaching materials throughout the country. All curricula and textbooks are examined and approved to prevent students from the influence of foreign ideologies.

In December 2019, the Ministry of Education of China published a guideline that outlines the policies for textbook writing, examination, and censorship in primary and secondary education. According to the guidelines, textbooks are administered at three levels:

* The State Level: Textbooks for national curricula are written by the State Council, and the state also examines, approves, and censors the local-level textbooks.
* The Local Level (provinces, cities, and counties): The party committees at local levels control the local-level textbook writing and examination and monitor the schools’ execution of the education policies.
* The school level: The schools are supposed to develop unique school curricula while implementing the policies, and if schools need to publish any textbook, they need to send the textbook to the party committees for censorship.

Under this hierarchical administrative system, the teaching materials must align with the directives of the Chinese Communist Party. The guidelines state that for subjects with content aligned with or reflected political ideologies, such as history and politics, the state will create standardized textbooks and curricula for use nationwide. Additionally, textbooks published locally that contain those content must be examined and approved by the propaganda department of the local-level party committee, ensuring adherence to national values and principles as defined by the Chinese Communist Party.

The party also exercises oversight over higher education, particularly within universities. In 2015, under Xi Jinping’s ideological campaign, the Minister of Education Yuan Guiren proposed the strict censorship of imported foreign textbooks in universities to make sure they align with socialist values and are not “spreading Western values.” Universities are required to prevent any circumstances that could disseminate negative perceptions of the government and the Party. Additionally, they are obligated to emphasize the propaganda of the Party&#x27;s principles and socialism and hold mandatory courses in Marxism.

There are voices in China that criticize the state&#x27;s intervention in academic freedom. Some question the effectiveness of academic censorship, stating that there are still students studying abroad and the government can&#x27;t ban information from everyone.

Positive opinions also exist regarding textbook policies. Professor Duan Zhaobing from the College of Educational Science at Anhui Normal University suggests that textbooks for primary and secondary education “have the mission of cultivating new people of the times who will be responsible for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” According to Duan, the examination and approval system enables the CCP to guide this process effectively. Duan also suggests that textbooks for primary and secondary education be reformed to cater to students from various regions and backgrounds. The local governments are obligated to offer more affordable “black and white” versions of textbooks for students in disadvantaged areas, alleviating the financial strain on their families.

=== Discrimination ===
==English education==

China&#x27;s first contact with the English language occurred between the Chinese and English traders, and the first missionary schools to teach English were established in Macau in the 1630s. The state emphasis of English education emerged after 1979 when the Cultural Revolution ended, China adopted the Open Door Policy, and the United States and China established strong diplomatic ties. An estimate of the number of English speakers in China is over 200 million and rising, with 50 million secondary school children now studying the language.

In China, most school children are taught their first English lesson at the age of 10. Despite the early learning of English, there is widespread criticism of the teaching and learning of the language. Schools in China are evaluated and financed based on test results. This causes teaching to be geared towards the skills tested. Students focus on rote-memorization (written and oral repetition) as the main learning strategy. These methods, which fit very well with the Chinese way of learning, have been criticized as fundamentally flawed by Western educationalists and linguists.
Furthermore, newly learned words are seldom put into use. This arises because everyone in China communicates through Mandarin or a regional Chinese dialect, and English is perceived to be of little use in the country. This has been further reinforced through the national Band 4 examination where 80% of the test is the writing component, 20% is devoted to listening, and speaking is excluded entirely. According to a national survey, only half of the teachers consider that vocabulary should be learned through conversation or communication. A far smaller percentage support activities such as role-playing or vocabulary games.

According to research completed by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in 2017, less than 1 percent of people in China speak English conversationally.

==Education for migrant children==
Following the large-scale movement of the Chinese rural population to the cities the children of these migrant workers either stay as left-behind children in the villages or they migrate with their parents to the cities. Although regulations by the central government stipulate that all migrant children have the right to attend a public school in the cities public schools nevertheless effectively reject these children by setting high thresholds such as school fees and exams or by requesting an urban registration (Hukou). Providing an alternative, private entrepreneurs established since the 1990s semi-official private schools that offered schooling to migrant children for lower fees. This system contributed to the segregation between urban and migrant children. Furthermore, these schools often have a poor teaching quality, provide only school certificates of limited value and sometimes even do not comply with safety regulations. Since the beginning of the 2000s, some local governments thus started campaigns to close these private schools but nevertheless, in many cities, these schools still exist. Although Chinese scholars have conducted case-study research on migrant children and their schools there is a lack in studies with a nationwide scope.

Studies among left-behind children in China found that they had lower self-esteem and more mental health problems than children overall. Teachers of left-behind children often lack the resources, understanding, or opportunity to communicate to family or guardians the need for them to provide support and attention. Analysis for the 2019 Global Education Monitoring Report found that children with absent mothers had lower grades in mathematics, Chinese, and English. Children with one or both parents absent had more symptoms of depression than those with present parents. Analysis from rural Gansu province (2000 and 2015) found that children with absent fathers had 0.4 fewer years of education.

<doc id="407847" wikidata="Q428352" url="?curid=407847" title="Patina">
<text>Patina ( or ) is a thin layer that variously forms on the surface of copper, brass, bronze, and similar metals and metal alloys (tarnish produced by oxidation or other chemical processes), or certain stones and wooden furniture (sheen produced by age, wear, and polishing), or any similar acquired change of a surface through age and exposure.

Additionally, the term is used to describe the aging of high-quality leather. The patinas on leather goods are unique to the type of leather, frequency of use, and exposure.

Patinas can provide a protective covering to materials that would otherwise be damaged by corrosion or weathering. They may also be aesthetically appealing.

==Usage==
On metal, patina is a coating of various chemical compounds such as oxides, carbonates, sulfides, or sulfates formed on the surface during exposure to atmospheric elements (oxygen, rain, acid rain, carbon dioxide, sulfur-bearing compounds). Patina also refers to accumulated changes in surface texture and color that result from normal use of an object such as a coin or a piece of furniture over time.

Archaeologists also use the term &quot;patina&quot; to refer to a corticated layer that develops over time that is due to a range of complex factors on flint tools and ancient stone monuments. This has led stone tool analysts in recent times to generally prefer the term &quot;cortification&quot; as a better term to describe the process than &quot;patination&quot;.

In geology and geomorphology, the term &quot;patina&quot; is used to refer to discolored film or thin outer layer produced either on or within the surface of a rock or other material by either the development of a weathering rind within the surface of a rock, the formation of desert varnish on the surface of a rock, or combination of both. It also refers to development as the result of weathering of a case-hardened layer, called &quot;cortex&quot; by geologists, within the surface of either a flint or chert nodule.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;patina&quot; comes from the Italian &quot;patina&quot; (shallow layer of deposit on a surface), derived from the Latin &quot;patĭna&quot; (pan, shallow dish). Figuratively, patina can refer to any fading, darkening, or other signs of age, which are felt to be natural or unavoidable (or both).

The chemical process by which a patina forms or is deliberately induced is called &quot;patination&quot;, and a work of art coated by a patina is said to be &quot;patinated&quot;.
==Acquired patina==

The green patina that forms naturally on copper and bronze, sometimes called verdigris, usually consists of varying mixtures of copper chlorides, sulfides, sulfates, and carbonates, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. In clean air rural environments, the patina is created by the slow chemical reaction of copper with carbon dioxide and water, producing a basic copper carbonate. In industrial and urban air environments containing sulfurous acid rain from coal-fired power plants or industrial processes, the final patina is primarily composed of sulphide or sulphate compounds.

A patina layer takes many years to develop under natural weathering. Buildings in damp coastal or marine environments will develop patina layers faster than ones in dry inland areas.

Façade cladding (copper cladding; copper wall cladding) with alloys of copper, like brass or bronze, will weather differently from &quot;pure&quot; copper cladding. Even a lasting gold colour is possible with copper-alloy cladding, for example Bristol Beacon in Bristol, or the Novotel at Paddington Central, London.

Antique and well-used firearms will often develop a layer of rust on the action, barrel, or other steel parts after the original finish has worn. On this subject gunsmith Mark Novak says &quot;... This is what everybody calls patina, I call it a nice thick coat of rust...&quot; The removal of such rust is often necessary for a firearm conservation to prevent further decay of the firearm.

==Applied patina==


Artists and metalworkers often deliberately add patinas as a part of the original design and decoration of art and furniture, or to simulate antiquity in newly made objects. The process is often called distressing.

A wide range of chemicals, both household and commercial, can give a variety of patinas. They are often used by artists as surface embellishments either for color, texture, or both. Patination composition varies with the reacted elements and these will determine the color of the patina. For copper alloys, such as bronze, exposure to chlorides leads to green, while sulfur compounds (such as &quot;liver of sulfur&quot;) tend to brown. The basic palette for patinas on copper alloys includes chemicals like ammonium sulfide (blue-black), liver of sulfur (brown-black), cupric nitrate (blue-green), and ferric nitrate (yellow-brown). For artworks, patination is often deliberately accelerated by applying chemicals with heat. Colors range from matte sandstone yellow to deep blues, greens, whites, reds, and various blacks. Some patina colors are achieved by the mixing of colors from the reaction with the metal surface with pigments added to the chemicals. Sometimes the surface is enhanced by waxing, oiling, or other types of lacquers or clear-coats. More simply, the French sculptor Auguste Rodin used to instruct assistants at his studio to urinate over bronzes stored in the outside yard. A patina can be produced on copper by the application of vinegar (acetic acid). This patina is water-soluble and will not last on the outside of a building like a &quot;true&quot; patina. It is usually used as pigment.

Patina is also found on slip rings and commutators. This type of patina is formed by corrosion, what elements the air might hold, residue from the wear of the carbon brush, and moisture; thus, the patina needs special conditions to work as intended.

Patinas can also be found in woks or other metal baking dishes. The process of applying patinas to cookware is known as seasoning. The patina on a wok is a dark coating of oils that have been polymerized onto it to prevent food from sticking. Scrubbing or using soap on a wok or other dishware could damage the patina and possibly allow rust.

Knife collectors that own carbon steel blades sometimes force a patina onto the blade to help protect it and give it a more personalized look. This can be done using various chemicals and substances such as muriatic acid, apple cider vinegar, or mustard. It can also be done by sticking the blade into any acidic vegetable or fruit such as an orange or an apple.

==Repatination==
In the case of antiques, a range of views are held on the value of patination and its replacement if damaged, known as repatination.

Preserving a piece&#x27;s look and character is important and removal or reduction may dramatically reduce its value. If patination has flaked off, repatination may be recommended. Appraiser Reyne Haines notes that a repatinated metal piece will be worth more than one with major imperfections in the patina, but less than a piece still with its original finish.

<doc id="407852" wikidata="Q158758" url="?curid=407852" title="Hyacinth">
<text>Hyacinthus is a small genus of bulbous herbs, spring-blooming perennials. They are fragrant flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae and are commonly called hyacinths (). The genus is native predominantly to the Eastern Mediterranean region from the south of Turkey to Northern Israel, although naturalized more widely.

The name comes from Greek mythology: Hyacinth was killed by Zephyrus, the god of the west wind, jealous of his love for Apollo, who then transformed the drops of blood into flowers.

Several species of &quot;Brodiaea&quot;, &quot;Scilla&quot;, and other plants that were formerly classified in the Liliaceae family and have flower clusters borne along the stalk also have common names with the word &quot;hyacinth&quot; in them. Hyacinths should also not be confused with the genus &quot;Muscari&quot;, which are commonly known as grape hyacinths.

==Description==
&quot;Hyacinthus&quot; grows from bulbs, each producing around four to six narrow untoothed leaves and one to three spikes or racemes of flowers. In the wild species, the flowers are widely spaced, with as few as two per raceme in &quot;H. litwinovii&quot; and typically six to eight in &quot;H. orientalis&quot; which grows to a height of . Cultivars of &quot;H. orientalis&quot; have much denser flower spikes and are generally more robust.

==Taxonomy==

The genus name &quot;Hyacinthus&quot; was attributed to Joseph Pitton de Tournefort when used by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It is derived from a Greek name used for a plant by Homer, (), the flowers supposedly having grown up from the blood of a youth of this name killed by the god Zephyr out of jealousy. The original wild plant known as &quot;hyakinthos&quot; to Homer has been identified with &quot;Scilla bifolia&quot;, among other possibilities. Linnaeus defined the genus &quot;Hyacinthus&quot; widely to include species now placed in other genera of the subfamily Scilloideae, such as &quot;Muscari&quot; (e.g. his &quot;Hyacinthus botryoides&quot;) and &quot;Hyacinthoides&quot; (e.g. his &quot;Hyacinthus non-scriptus&quot;).

&quot;Hyacinthus&quot; was formerly the type genus of the separate family Hyacinthaceae; prior to that, the genus was placed in the lily family Liliaceae.

===Species===
Three species are placed within the genus &quot;Hyacinthus&quot;:
* &quot;Hyacinthus litwinovii&quot; – north-east Iran to southern Turkmenistan
* &quot;Hyacinthus orientalis&quot; - Iraq, Lebanon-Syria, Israel, Turkey; common, Dutch or garden hyacinth 
* &quot;Hyacinthus transcaspicus&quot; – north-east Iran to southern Turkmenistan

Some authorities place &quot;H. litwonovii&quot; and &quot;H. transcaspicus&quot; in the related genus &quot;Hyacinthella&quot;, which would make &quot;Hyacinthus&quot; a monotypic genus.

==Distribution==
The genus &quot;Hyacinthus&quot; is considered native to the eastern Mediterranean from southern Turkey to the region of Palestine, including Lebanon and Syria, and on through Iraq and Iran to Turkmenistan. It is widely naturalized elsewhere, including Europe (Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Sardinia, Sicily and former Yugoslavia), Cyprus, North America (California, Pennsylvania, Texas), central Mexico, the Caribbean (Cuba, Haiti) and Korea.

==Cultivation==
The Dutch, or common hyacinth, of house and garden culture (&quot;H. orientalis&quot;, native to Southwest Asia) was so popular in the 18th century that over 2,000 cultivars were grown in the Netherlands, its chief commercial producer. This hyacinth has a single dense spike of fragrant flowers in shades of red, blue, white, orange, pink, violet or yellow. A form of the common hyacinth is the less hardy and smaller blue- or white-petalled Roman hyacinth. These flowers need full sunlight and should be watered moderately.

==Toxicity==
The inedible bulbs contain oxalic acid and may cause mild skin irritation. Protective gloves are recommended.

Some members of the plant subfamily Scilloideae are commonly called hyacinths but are not members of the genus &quot;Hyacinthus&quot; and are edible; one example is the tassel hyacinth, which forms part of the cuisine of some Mediterranean countries.

==Culture==

Hyacinths are often associated with spring and rebirth. The hyacinth flower is used in the Haft-Seen table setting for the Persian New Year celebration, Nowruz, held at the spring equinox. The Persian word for hyacinth is (&quot;), meaning &#x27;cluster&#x27;.

The name (&quot;) was used in Ancient Greece for at least two distinct plants, which have variously been identified as &quot;Scilla bifolia&quot; or &quot;Orchis quadripunctata&quot; and &quot;Consolida ajacis&quot; (larkspur). Plants known by this name were sacred to Aphrodite.

The hyacinth appears in the first section of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; during a conversation between the narrator and the &quot;hyacinth girl&quot; that takes place in the spring.

In Roman Catholic tradition, &quot;H. orientalis&quot; represents prudence, constancy, desire of heaven and peace of mind.

American rock band The Doors released a song entitled &quot;Hyacinth House&quot; which appeared on their 1971 album &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, the last to feature lead singer Jim Morrison.

==Colour==
The colour of the blue flower hyacinth plant varies between &#x27;mid-blue&#x27;, violet blue and bluish purple. Within this range can be found Persenche, which is an American color name (probably from French), for a hyacinth hue.
The colour analysis of Persenche is 73% ultramarine, 9% red and 18% white.

<text>Hyacinth or Hyacinthus (Ancient Greek: , , ) is a deified hero and a lover of Apollo in Greek mythology. His cult at Amyclae southwest of Sparta dates from the Mycenaean era. The hero is mythically linked to local cults and identified with Apollo. In the Classical period, a temenos (sanctuary) grew up around what was alleged to be his burial mound, which was located at the feet of a statue of Apollo.

== Family ==
Hyacinth was given various parentage, providing local links, as the son of Clio and Pierus, or King Oebalus of Sparta, or of king Amyclus of Sparta, progenitor of the people of Amyclae, dwellers about Sparta. As the youngest and most beautiful son of Amyclas and Diomede, daughter of Lapithes, Hyacinth was the brother of Cynortus, Argalus, Polyboea, Laodamia (or Leanira), Harpalus, Hegesandra, and in other versions, of Daphne. 

==Mythology==
In Greek mythology, Hyacinthus was a Spartan prince of remarkable beauty and a lover of the god of the sun Apollo. He was also admired by Zephyrus, the god of the West wind, Boreas, the god of the North wind and a mortal man named Thamyris. Hyacinthus chose Apollo over the others. He visited all of Apollo&#x27;s sacred lands with the god in a chariot drawn by swans. So fiercely was Apollo in love with Hyacinthus that he abandoned his sanctuary in Delphi to enjoy Hyacinthus&#x27; company by the river Eurotas. He taught Hyacinthus the use of the bow and the lyre, the art of prophecy, and exercises in the gymnasium.

One day they decided to have a friendly competition by taking turns to throw the discus, which resulted in Apollo accidentally killing Hyachinthus. In Ovid&#x27;s telling of the story, Apollo threw first, with a strength so great that the discus split the clouds in the sky. Eager to retrieve the discus, Hyacinthus ran behind it to catch it. But as it hit the ground, the discus bounced back, hitting Hyacinthus&#x27; head and wounding him fatally. An alternative version of the myth holds Zephyrus responsible for the death of Hyacinthus. Jealous that Hyacinthus preferred the radiant Apollo, Zephyrus blew Apollo&#x27;s quoit boisterously off course to kill Hyacinthus.

Apollo&#x27;s face turned pale as he held his dying lover in his arms. In a poem by Bion of Smyrna, Apollo used all sorts of herbs and even tried giving ambrosia to heal Hyacinthus&#x27; wound, but it was futile, for he could not cure the wound inflicted by the Fates. Apollo wept for Hyacinthus&#x27;s death and expressed his wish to become a mortal to join the Spartan boy in his death. That being unachievable because of his immortality, Apollo promised that he would always remind himself of Hyacinthus through his songs and the music of his lyre. He created a flower from Hyacinthus&#x27; spilled blood, the hyacinth, and inscribed on its petals the words of lamentation, &quot;AI AI&quot; – &quot;alas&quot;. However, based on its ancient description, the flower Hyacinth turned into is not the modern plant bearing that name.

The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; said Thamyris, who showed romantic feelings towards Hyacinthus, was the first man to have loved another man.

===Apotheosis and Hyacinthia===
Hyacinthus was eventually resurrected by Apollo and attained immortality. Pausanias has recorded that the throne of Apollo in Sparta had the depiction of bearded Hyacinthus being taken to heaven along with Polyboea by Aphrodite, Athena and Artemis.

Hyacinthus was the tutelary deity of one of the principal Spartan festivals, Hyacinthia, celebrated in the Spartan month of Hyacinthia (in early summer). The festival lasted three days, one day of mourning for the death of Hyacinth, and the last two celebrating his rebirth, though the division of honours is a subject for scholarly controversy. On the first day, people mourned his death by eating as little as possible and abstaining from singing songs, contrary to all the other festivals of Apollo. On the second day, choirs of boys and young men sang some of their national songs and danced. As for the girls, some were carried in decorated wicker carts and others paraded in chariots pulled by two horses, which they raced. Citizens entertained their friends and even their own servants. Every year the Laconian women wove a chiton for Apollo and presented it to him, a tradition similar to the peplos offered to Athena at Athens upon the occasion of the Panathenaic Games. Less is known about the third day, indicating that probably mysteries were held. It is described as &quot;merry midnight festival&quot;.

So important was this festival that Amyclaeans, even when they had taken the field against an enemy, always returned home on the approach of the season of the Hyacinthia, and the Lacedaemonians on one occasion concluded a truce of forty days with the town of Eira merely to be able to return home and celebrate the national festival. After the treaty with Sparta, B.C. 421, the Athenians, to show their good-will towards Sparta, promised every year to attend the celebration of the Hyacinthia.

==Cults and attributes==

Hyacinthus had a shrine in Amyclea, which he came to share with Apollo. Various scholars agree that Hyacinthus was a pre-Hellenic nature god, and certain aspects of his own cult suggest that he was a chthonic vegetation deity whose cults were merged with Apollo&#x27;s. Nilsson says that Hyacinthus is a Cretan word, and its pre-Hellenic origin is indicated by the suffix -nth. Hyacinthus personifies the sprouting vegetation in spring, which is killed by the heat of the summer. The apotheosis of Hyacinthus indicates that, after attaining godhood, he represented the natural cycle of decay and renewal.

The fact that at Tarentum a Hyacinthus tomb is ascribed by Polybius to &quot;Apollo Hyacinthus&quot; (not Hyacinthus) has led some to think that the personalities are one, and that the hero is merely an emanation from the god; confirmation is sought in the Apolline appellation τετράχειρ, alleged by Hesychius to have been used in Laconia, and assumed to describe a composite figure of Apollo-Hyacinthus. Against this theory is the essential difference between the two figures. Hyacinthus is a chthonian vegetation god whose worshippers are afflicted and sorrowful; though interested in vegetation, Apollo&#x27;s death is not celebrated in any ritual, his worship is joyous and triumphant, and finally, the Amyclean Apollo is specifically the god of war and song. Moreover, Pausanias describes the monument at Amyclae as consisting of a rude figure of Apollo standing on an altar-shaped base that formed the tomb of Hyacinthus. Into the latter offerings were put for the hero before gifts were made to the god.
Hyacinthus was gifted a swan chariot by Apollo and appeared in ancient arts riding it, either to meet Apollo or to escape the advances of Zephyrus. Swans were believed to be the birds of Hyperborea, a mystical land of eternal spring and immortality, to which Apollo himself traveled every winter on a chariot drawn by swans. This association of Hyacinth with swans places him in close connection to Hyperborean Apollo and spring. It is suggested that Hyacinthus would have spent the winter months in the underworld, or more suitably Hyperborea and returning to earth in the spring when the hyacinth flower blooms.

According to classical interpretations, his myth is a metaphor of the death and rebirth of nature. The festival Hyacinthia included the initiatory rites, that is, the initiation of youths into adulthood.

=== Attributes ===

The flower hyacinth that rose from Hyacinth&#x27;s blood is said to have had a deep blue or purple hue and a sign resembling the inscription &quot;AI&quot; on its petals, a symbol of sorrow. However, this flower has been identified with another plant, the larkspur, or an iris, or perhaps gladiolus italicus rather than what we today call hyacinth. Other divinely beloved vegetation gods who died in the flower of their youth and were vegetatively transformed include Narcissus, Cyparissus, Mecon and Adonis.

Ancient Greeks associated with Apollo a deep blue or violet precious gem called hyacinth. It was called so because its colour resembled that of the hyacinth flowers. This gem was held sacred to Apollo due to the mythological connection. The people who visited Apollo&#x27;s shrine, as well as his priests and the high priestess Pythia, were required to wear this gem.

The term &#x27;Hyacinthine hair&#x27; refers to the curly hair of Hyacinthus that resembles the curled petals of hyacinth flowers. It is often used poetically. The term could also be descriptive of the colour of the hair; either dark or deep violet. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Athena gives Odysseus hyacinthine hair to make him look more beautiful. Edgar Allan Poe, in the poem &quot;To Helen&quot;, uses the same term to beautify Helen&#x27;s hair.

<text>Sinanju is a region (신안주) in Anju city, South Pyongan Province, North Korea. The name literally means &quot;Comfortable New Village.&quot; When Anju County was raised to the status of a city in August 1987, Sinanju Workers&#x27; District was divided into Sinwon-dong, Wonhung-dong, Yokchon-dong.

==History==
On May 9, 1951, the U.S. Air Force conducted the most massive airstrike of the Korean war to date - at least 300 planes converged on a city on the Yalu River.

Sinanju&#x27;s bridges and railways were bombed by the United States Air Force during the Korean War to halt the transport of supplies to North Korea. During the second Korean winter, railways and bridges leading from Sinanju to Chongju were bombed by the U.S. on January 25, 1952, but were repaired five days later. During the last week of March 1952, U.S. forces began using B-29 Superfortresses through April to destroy bridges between Sinanju and Pyongyang.

During the third Korean winter of the war, the USAF targeted five railroad bridges over the Chongchon Estuary near Sinanju in January 1953. Trains were supposed to dock in marshaling yards there. Allied bombers destroyed them at night, but this only stopped enemy transport temporarily. Consequentially, in Spring of 1953, Communist troops had more difficulty transporting troops and supplies due to relentless allied intervention.

According to a bomb assessment conducted by the U.S. Air Force, over the course of the Korean War 100 percent of Sinanju was destroyed by the U.S. bombing; four other North Korean cities were at least 90 percent destroyed. 
* Musan - 5%
* Najin (Rashin) - 5%
* Unggi (Sonbong County) - 5%
* Anju - 15%
* Sinuiju - 50%
* Songjin (Kimchaek) - 50%
* Chongju (Chŏngju) - 60%
* Kanggye - 60% (reduced from previous estimate of 75%)
* Haeju - 75%
* Pyongyang - 75%
* Kyomipo (Songnim) - 80%
* Hamhung (Hamhŭng) - 80%
* Chinnampo (Namp&#x27;o)- 80%
* Wonsan (Wŏnsan)- 80%
* Hungnam (Hŭngnam) - 85%
* Sunan (Sunan-guyok) - 90%
* Sariwon (Sariwŏn) - 95%
* Hwangju (Hwangju County) - 97%
* Kunu-ri (Kunu-dong)- 100%
* Sinanju - 100%

<text>Charley Case (August 27, 1858 – November 26, 1916) was an American vaudeville performance artist who delivered the first known example of stand-up comedy in the late 1880s, delivering humorous monologues directly to the audience while standing in one spot without props or costumes. He is credited with creating the term &quot;punchline&quot; as he often used his arms in a punch-line motion during his stories. Case also wrote and sang vaudeville parodies of the 19th-century ballad style. He influenced F. Gregory Hartswick, who wrote similar songs.

Case is thought to have been &quot;mulatto&quot;. He started his career as a blackface comedian in America, but switched to a monologue format without props. Little official documentation of his personal history is available, but there are reports that he was mixed and sought to &quot;pass&quot;. It was not uncommon at the time for African-Americans to perform in blackface as a loophole into the entertainment business.

In 1910, after recovering from a nervous breakdown, he went on tour in England, where for the first time he performed the song &quot;There was once a poor young man who left his country home.&quot; The 1933 film &quot;The Fatal Glass of Beer&quot; is based on this song, and comedian W. C. Fields performs it at the onset. Critic Harold Bloom remarked several years later that Fields, &quot;croaking his ghastly dirge to the uncertain sound of his dulcimer, is a parodic version of the Bard of Sensibility, a figure out of the primitivism of Thomas Gray or William Blake.&quot;

==Style==
According to Sigmund Spaeth, in his 1926 book, &quot;Read &#x27;Em and Weep: The Songs You Forgot to Remember,&quot; the interpreter of a Case song would sing in a &quot;very matter-of-fact voice, with little or no expression, letting the words speak for themselves.&quot; Case is also sometimes credited with being one of the first to employ the stand-up style when, in the 1880s and 90s, he began to do comedic monologues without props or costumes, something that had never been done before.

In 1906, &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; wrote that, &quot;He is of a quiet and retiring disposition when off the stage, and to see him on the street or at his hotel one would never take him for a comedian who makes thousands laugh every season.&quot; That year the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; called him &quot;one of the funniest monologue comedians in the business.&quot;

==Death==
He died on November 26, 1916, at the Palace Hotel on 45th Street in New York. Another vaudevillian reported that Case shot himself and that his dying words were &quot;Pardon me.&quot; The police were told that a bottle of oil and a cleaning cloth were on the floor, evidence that he had accidentally killed himself while cleaning his gun. However, Spaeth wrote that, &quot;Case&#x27;s untimely death was supposedly due to the accidental explosion of a gun that he was cleaning, but it is generally recognized in the theatrical profession that he shot himself. Mixed blood was the chief reason.&quot; He was known for a quiet, shy, and brooding nature.

His wife Charlotte is said to have died from a heart attack upon hearing the news.

==Music==
Lyrics to two of Charley Case&#x27;s songs:

&quot;There was once a poor young man who left his country home,&lt;br&gt;
And came to the city to seek employment;&lt;br&gt;
He promised his dear mother that he&#x27;d lead the simple life, &lt;br&gt;
And always shun the fatal curse of drink.

He came to the city and accepted employment in a quarry, &lt;br&gt;
And while there he made the acquaintance of some college men;&lt;br&gt;
He little guessed that they were demons, for they wore the best of clothes,&lt;br&gt;
But clothes do not always make the gentleman.

One night he went out with his new-found friends to dine,&lt;br&gt;
And they tried to persuade him to take a drink;&lt;br&gt;
They tempted him and tempted him, but he refused and he refused,&lt;br&gt;
Till finally he took a glass of beer.

When he seen what he had done he dashed the liquor to the floor,&lt;br&gt;
And he staggered through the door with delirium tremens;&lt;br&gt;
While in the grip of liquor he met a Salvation Army lassie,&lt;br&gt;
And cruelly he broke her tambourine.

All she said was &#x27;Heaven bless you!&#x27; and placed a mark upon his brow,&lt;br&gt;
With a kick that she had learned before she was saved;&lt;br&gt;
So kind friends, take my advice and shun the fatal curse of drink,&lt;br&gt;
And don&#x27;t go around breaking people&#x27;s tambourines.&quot;

&quot;And&quot;

&quot;There was once a poor young girl who left her country home,&lt;br&gt;
And came to the city to seek employment;&lt;br&gt;
She had to leave her home because the wolf was at the door,&lt;br&gt;
And her father had fallen down and hurt his knee.

Just before she went away her sweetheart, whose name was Jack,&lt;br&gt;
Said to her &#x27;I fear you will not be true&#x27;;&lt;br&gt;
And so she had to promise him before she got on the train,&lt;br&gt;
That every night at eight o&#x27;clock she would burst into tears.

She came to the city, and was riding on a street car,&lt;br&gt;
When a man got up and offered her his seat;&lt;br&gt;
She refused the offer with scorn, for she saw that he wore a ring,&lt;br&gt;
And she didn&#x27;t know but that he might be a married man.

Then up came the conductor and said, &#x27;I knew you would be true!&#x27;&lt;br&gt;
And tore off his false whiskers, and it was Jack!&lt;br&gt;
And that day she got a telegram saying that her father&#x27;s knee was better,&lt;br&gt;
And an aunt had died and left her $58,000.00.&quot;

<text>In linguistics and semiotics, a notation system is a system of graphics or symbols, characters and abbreviated expressions, used (for example) in artistic and scientific disciplines to represent technical facts and quantities by convention. Therefore, a notation is a collection of related symbols that are each given an arbitrary meaning, created to facilitate structured communication within a domain knowledge or field of study.

Standard notations refer to general agreements in the way things are written or denoted. The term is generally used in technical and scientific areas of study like mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology, but can also be seen in areas like business, economics and music.

==Written communication==

===Writing systems===
* Phonographic writing systems, by definition, use symbols to represent components of auditory language, i.e. speech, which in turn refers to things or ideas. The two main kinds of phonographic notational system are the alphabet and the syllabary. Some written languages are more consistent in their correlation of written symbols (or graphemes) with sound (or phonemes), and are therefore considered to have better phonemic orthography.
* Ideographic writing, by definition, refers to things or ideas independently of their pronunciation in any language. Some ideographic systems are also pictograms that convey meaning through their pictorial resemblance to a physical object.

===Linguistics===
* Various brackets, parentheses, slashes, and lines are used around words and letters in linguistics to distinguish written from spoken forms, etc. See .

===Biology and medicine===
* Nucleic acid notation
* Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)
* Sequence motif pattern-description notations
* Cytogenetic notation
* Energy Systems Language

===Chemistry===
* A chemical formula describes a chemical compound using element symbols and subscripts, e.g. for water or for glucose
* SMILES is a notation for describing the structure of a molecule with a plain text string, e.g. N=N for nitrogen or CCO for ethanol

===Computing===
* BNF (Backus normal form, or Backus–Naur form) and EBNF (extended Backus-Naur form) are the two main notation techniques for context-free grammars.
* Drakon-charts are a graphical notation of algorithms and procedural knowledge.
* Hungarian notation is an identifier naming convention in computer programming, that represents the type or intended use of a variable with a specific pattern within its name. 
* Mathematical markup languages are computer notations for representing mathematical formulae.
* Various notations have been developed to specify regular expressions.
* The APL programming language provided a rich set of very concise new notations

===Logic===
A variety of symbols are used to express logical ideas; see the List of logic symbols

===Management===
* Time and motion study symbols such as therbligs

===Mathematics===
*Mathematical notation is used to represent various kinds of mathematical ideas.
** All types of notation in probability
** Cartesian coordinate system, for representing position and other spatial concepts in analytic geometry
** Notation for differentiation, common representations of the derivative in calculus
** Big O notation, used for example in analysis to represent less significant elements of an expression, to indicate that they will be neglected
** Z notation, a formal notation for specifying objects using Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and first-order predicate logic
** Ordinal notation
** Set-builder notation, a formal notation for defining sets in set theory
* Systems to represent very large numbers
** Conway chained arrow notation, an arrow system
** Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation, an arrow system 
** Steinhaus–Moser notation, Polygon Numbers
** Schläfli symbol in geometry
** Symbol Levelled notation, The Ultimate Leveller
* Numeral systems, notation for writing numbers, including
** Arabic numerals
** Roman numerals
** Scientific notation for expressing large and small numbers
** Sign-value notation, using signs or symbols to represent numbers
** Positional notation also known as place-value notation, in which each position is related to the next by a multiplier which is called the &quot;base&quot; of that numeral system
*** Binary notation, a positional notation in base two
*** Octal notation, a positional notation in base eight, used in some computers
*** Decimal notation, a positional notation in base ten
*** Hexadecimal notation, a positional notation in base sixteen, commonly used in computers
*** Sexagesimal notation, an ancient numeral system in base sixty
* See also Table of mathematical symbols - for general tokens and their definitions...

===Physics===
* Bra–ket notation, or Dirac notation, is an alternative representation of probability distributions in quantum mechanics.
* Tensor index notation is used when formulating physics (particularly continuum mechanics, electromagnetism, relativistic quantum mechanics and field theory, and general relativity) in the language of tensors.

===Typographical conventions===
* Infix notation, the common arithmetic and logical formula notation, such as &quot;&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; − &quot;c&quot;&quot;.
* Polish notation or &quot;prefix notation&quot;, which places the operator before the operands (arguments), such as &quot;+ &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot;&quot;.
* Reverse Polish notation or &quot;postfix notation&quot;, which places the operator after the operands, such as &quot;&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; +&quot;.

===Sports and games===
* Baseball scorekeeping, to represent a game of baseball
* Aresti Catalogue, to represent aerobatic manoeuvres
* Chess notation, to represent moves in a game of chess
** Algebraic notation
***Portable Game Notation
** Descriptive notation
** Forsyth–Edwards Notation
* Siteswap notation represents a juggling pattern as a sequence of numbers
* Singmaster notation, to represent Rubik&#x27;s Cube moves

==Graphical notations==
===Music===
* Musical notation permits a composer to express musical ideas in a musical composition, which can be read and interpreted during performance by a trained musician; there are many different ways to do this (hundreds have been proposed), although staff notation provides by far the most widely used system of modern musical symbols.

===Dance and movement===
* Benesh Movement Notation permits a graphical representation of human bodily movements
* Laban Movement Analysis or Labanotation permits a graphical representation of human bodily movements
* Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation permits a graphical representation of bodily movements of other species in addition to humans, and indeed any kind of movement (e.g. aircraft aerobatics)
* Juggling diagrams represent juggling patterns
* Aresti aerobatic symbols provides a way to represent flight maneuvers in aerobatics

===Science===
* Feynman diagrams permit a graphical representation of a perturbative contribution to the transition amplitude or correlation function of a quantum mechanical or statistical field theory
* Structural formulas are graphical representations of molecules
* Venn diagrams shows logical relations between a finite collection of sets.
* Drakon-charts are a graphical representation of algorithms and procedural knowledge.
* Unified Modeling Language is a standard notation for many types of diagrams

===Other systems===
* Whyte notation for classifying steam locomotives by wheel arrangement

<doc id="407867" wikidata="Q300292" url="?curid=407867" title="Jeffrey Donaldson">
<text>Sir Jeffrey Mark Donaldson (born 7 December 1962) is a British former politician, who served as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) from 2021 to 2024, and leader of the DUP in the UK House of Commons from 2019 to 2024. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lagan Valley from 1997 to 2024.

Donaldson was a member of the Orange Order and served in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) during the Troubles. He was also the campaign manager for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MP Enoch Powell&#x27;s successful re-election campaigns in 1983 and 1986. He was the UUP candidate for Lagan Valley at the 1997 general election, and was elected as an MP to the House of Commons. He simultaneously represented the same constituency as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the Northern Ireland Assembly from 2003 to 2010. Donaldson is known for his opposition to UUP leader David Trimble&#x27;s support of the Good Friday Agreement during the Northern Ireland peace process, especially from 1998 to 2003. In 2003, Donaldson resigned from the UUP, becoming a member of the DUP in the following year.

Donaldson served in the Northern Ireland Executive from 2008 to 2009 as a Junior Minister for First Minister Peter Robinson. After Nigel Dodds lost his seat at the 2019 general election, Donaldson became the DUP Westminster leader. He was a candidate in the May 2021 DUP leadership election, losing to Edwin Poots. After Poots resigned the following month, Donaldson was elected unopposed to succeed Poots in the June DUP leadership election; he was confirmed in the post by the party&#x27;s ruling executive on 30 June.

In February 2022, the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed due to DUP protests against the Northern Ireland Protocol. Donaldson was once again elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in the 2022 Assembly election, but he subsequently chose to remain as a Westminster MP, with Emma Little-Pengelly instead taking his seat. Donaldson opposed the Windsor Framework announced by the Sunak government in February 2023 and, for 22 months, Donaldson refused to nominate a deputy First Minister to restore Stormont. In February 2024, the Northern Ireland Executive was restored after a deal was agreed by Donaldson with Sunak&#x27;s government.

In March 2024, he stepped down as leader of the DUP, having been charged with rape and historical sexual offences, triggering a leadership election. The party also suspended his membership. Donaldson said that he would strenuously contest the criminal charges. In May 2024, Donaldson&#x27;s solicitor confirmed that he was not intending to stand for re-election at the 2024 general election.

==Early life==
Donaldson was born in Kilkeel, County Down, Northern Ireland, and was the oldest of five boys and three girls. He attended Kilkeel High School, where he excelled at debating, then Castlereagh College. At the age of sixteen he joined the Orange Order, and then the UUP&#x27;s Young Unionists.

Two of Donaldson&#x27;s cousins were killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) while serving in the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC): Sam Donaldson was killed in 1970 and Alex Donaldson, a Chief Inspector, died in a mortar attack on a Newry police station in 1985.

Donaldson served with the Kilkeel company of the 3rd Battalion UDR (3 UDR), and was promoted to corporal.

Donaldson worked as an insurance broker in the 1980s.

==Political career==
From 1982 to 1984, he was the constituency agent for the UUP MP Enoch Powell, managing Powell&#x27;s successful re-election campaigns in 1983 and 1986. He then worked as personal assistant to the UUP leader James Molyneaux until Molyneaux retired from politics in 1997.

===Entering politics===
In October 1985, at the age of 22, following the death of Raymond McCullough, Donaldson was elected with a large majority in a by-election to the Northern Ireland Assembly to represent South Down. In April 1986, Donaldson took part in a unionist demonstration attempting to blockade a conference of the Ulster Teachers&#x27; Union held in Newcastle, County Down, in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Demonstrators blocked teachers&#x27; cars and scuffled with the police; at one point protestors broke through police lines and attacked Education Minister Brian Mawhinney&#x27;s car with flag poles. After further violence, arrests were made. Donaldson told reporters afterward: &quot;What we&#x27;re saying to Brian Mawhinney here today is that he may think that he is an Ulsterman but the people of Ulster want no part of a man who has betrayed the people of Ulster.&quot; Mawhinney labelled the protestors &quot;thugs&quot;. In June that year, after Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, ordered the dissolution the Assembly, Donaldson was one of 21 unionist representatives who refused to leave the chamber at Stormont and was eventually physically removed from the building by the RUC.

In 1996, he was first-placed candidate on the UUP list for the Northern Ireland Forum elections, virtually guaranteeing him a seat. Donaldson, by that time serving as Assistant Grand Master of the Orange Order, was a prominent figure in the ongoing Drumcree conflict over a yearly loyalist parade in the town of Portadown. He justified unionist demonstrators cutting off Belfast International Airport by saying, &quot;in a democracy people have the right to protest and unfortunately some people get inconvenienced.&quot; That led to his selection, in January 1997, as a candidate for the Westminster Parliament, and he was elected at the 1997 general election as the MP for the Lagan Valley constituency, succeeding James Molyneaux. At that time, he was tipped as a potential future leader of the Ulster Unionist Party.

Donaldson stated in Richard English&#x27;s book, &quot;Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA&quot;, that because of a &quot;deep sense of injustice that I felt had been perpetrated against my people and specifically against my family&quot;, he joined both the UDR and the UUP at the age of 18 to oppose the IRA both militarily and politically.

===Role in the peace process===
In 1998, Donaldson was in the UUP&#x27;s negotiating team for the Good Friday Agreement. However, on the morning the day the agreement was concluded on 10 April 1998, Donaldson walked out of the delegation. He rejected some of the arrangements, notably the lack of a link between Sinn Féin&#x27;s admittance to government and IRA decommissioning.

===Dissent from the UUP===
Donaldson engineered several party council meetings in protest against David Trimble&#x27;s policies. The council, however, backed Trimble&#x27;s leadership, and on 23 June 2003, along with fellow MPs David Burnside and Martin Smyth, Donaldson resigned the Ulster Unionist whip at Westminster. The MPs remained party members and in November 2003 Assembly election Donaldson was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for the UUP as an MLA for Lagan Valley.

Following the success of the rival DUP in the same Assembly election of 2003, Donaldson reiterated his call for Trimble&#x27;s immediate resignation, but the party continued to back Trimble. On 18 December 2003 Donaldson, Norah Beare MLA and Arlene Foster announced their resignation from the UUP, and on 5 January 2004 they announced that they had joined the DUP.

===After joining the DUP ===
Donaldson was returned to the House of Commons in the 2005 UK general election and, in 2007, he was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, entitling him to the honorific style of &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. At the March 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election, he was re-elected as an MLA for Lagan Valley.

In July 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Donaldson had repaid £555 claimed for pay-to-view films in overnight hotel stays. In total, Donaldson submitted claim forms, including receipts, for 68 pay-to-view movies. The newspaper claimed &quot;hotel sources confirmed that films he put on his expenses during 2004 and 2005 were in the highest price category offered to guests, covering the latest blockbusters and adult movies&quot;, although no evidence was offered and Donaldson issued an official statement denying watching any content of an adult or pornographic nature.

Donaldson was appointed to government by First Minister Peter Robinson, and held the position of Junior Minister in the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister from 2008 to 2009. Being also an MP, he lost his position due to the DUP&#x27;s phasing out of &quot;double jobbing&quot;. Following his re-election to the House of Commons at the general election in May 2010, Donaldson stood down from the Northern Ireland Assembly on 10 June, and was replaced on 16 June by Paul Givan.

He was a member of the Public Bill Committee for the Defence Reform Act 2014.

===DUP leadership ===
On 3 May 2021, exactly 100 years after Northern Ireland was effectively established, Donaldson declared his candidacy for the leadership of the DUP to replace Arlene Foster. He lost the subsequent leadership election to Edwin Poots MLA, by 19 votes to 17.

Poots resigned after only 21 days as leader, having faced an internal revolt against his decision to proceed without delay to nominate Paul Givan as First Minister, after Sinn Féin had reached an agreement with the Westminster government about an Irish Language Act. The &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; described the events as &quot;one of the most tumultuous days in the DUP&#x27;s 50-year history&quot;.

On 21 June, Donaldson declared his candidacy for the leadership of the DUP to replace Poots, pledging to make the Northern Ireland Protocol his main priority. He was the sole candidate. The party&#x27;s electoral college endorsed him as leader-designate and he was confirmed in the post by the party&#x27;s ruling executive on 30 June.

In July 2021, Donaldson said in a UTV interview that he intended to resign his seat as a Westminster MP and become Northern Ireland First Minister before the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election, but also said that he did not yet know precisely how he would bring that about.

In August 2021, UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, appointed Donaldson as the UK&#x27;s trade envoy to Cameroon, in addition to his role as the trade envoy to Egypt.

It was announced on 24 August 2021, that Donaldson was planning to stand as a candidate for Lagan Valley in the Assembly election the following year if he was not co-opted to a vacant seat in the time leading up to the election. Plans were drawn up to temporarily re-allow &quot;double jobbing&quot;, which would have allowed Donaldson to be in the Assembly and remain an MP. However, these plans were dropped, so, if Donaldson were to become a member of the Assembly, he would cease to be an MP, triggering a by-election. Donaldson was elected to the Assembly in the May 2022 election, but declined to take up his seat, with the party instead co-opting Emma Little-Pengelly. Donaldson said he would not take up his Assembly seat until the situation over the Northern Ireland Protocol was resolved.

On 29 March 2024, Donaldson resigned as DUP leader after being charged with rape and other historical sexual allegations, which he said he would &quot;strenuously contest&quot;. Due to the ongoing case, John McBurney, Donaldson&#x27;s solicitor, confirmed in May 2024 that Donaldson would not be contesting the July 2024 general election.

===Views===
Donaldson opposed the Good Friday Agreement. He supported Brexit, but called for the Northern Ireland Protocol agreement between the UK and the EU in December 2020, which establishes a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain, to be reformed or revoked. Despite his earlier rejection of the Good Friday Agreement, he stated in January 2021 that the Protocol &quot;actually undermines the Good Friday agreement&quot;.

In 2009, Donaldson was accused of making anti-Catholic comments. Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) deputy leader Alasdair McDonnell demanded an apology from Donaldson and a retraction of his claim that Catholics owed allegiance in the first instance to the Pope and the Holy See.

In March 2019, Donaldson was one of 21 MPs who voted against LGBT-inclusive sex and relationship education in English schools. He opposes same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, legalised by the British Government in December 2019.

==Personal life==
On 26 June 1987, Donaldson married Eleanor Cousins, with whom he has two daughters.

He is a member of the mainstream Presbyterian Church in Ireland.

Speaking of his national identity, Donaldson says that he is &quot;Irish and British, Northern Irish and British, and British.&quot; He noted that he was a member of the Irish Presbyterian church, which is organised on an all-Ireland basis. He described his national identity as geographically Irish, but also as being &quot;part of a wider group of nations that is British&quot;. He believes that there is no contradiction in identifying as Irish, Northern Irish and British.

== Sexual offence allegations==
=== Arrest and charge ===
On 28 March 2024, Donaldson was arrested by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and charged with rape and a number of other sexual offences. His wife also faced aiding-and-abetting charges related to the same matter. The following day he stood down as leader of the DUP. The Orange Order and the DUP suspended his memberships in March 2024 pending the outcome of the judicial process, as required by their rules. Donaldson said that he would contest the charges.

As Donaldson and his wife are co-defendants they were initially bailed to separate properties, and thus she returned to their marital home in Dromore while he flew to London to reside in a flat in Greenwich. In response to what it deemed &quot;unhelpful speculation&quot; by some members of the public and media outlets (in regards to his legal issues being used to influence his decision to restore the Executive in January 2024), the PSNI released a statement clarifying that they first received a complaint that resulted in Donaldson&#x27;s arrest in early March 2024. On 7 April 2024, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; newspaper reported that allegations had been made to police as early as January 2024.

Donaldson is charged with 11 offences relating to two complainants. They are: one count of rape allegedly committed between 1985 and 1991, one count of gross indecency towards a child allegedly committed in 2005 or 2006, and nine counts of indecent assault against a female, allegedly committed between 1985 and 2006. His wife Eleanor is charged with two counts of cruelty to a person under 16 years old, one count of aiding and abetting rape, and one count of aiding and abetting indecent assault on a female. Her charges also relate to two complainants and are alleged to have occurred between 1985 and 2004.
=== Pre-trial proceedings ===
On 24 April 2024, Donaldson and his wife appeared before Newry Magistrates&#x27; Court to confirm that they understood the charges against them. They were given bail of £350 each and the no-contact was lifted. 

On 3 July 2024, Donaldson and his wife again appeared before Newry Magistrates&#x27; Court, where prosecution lawyers asserted that there was a prima facie case to answer and both defendants had failed to offer any contrary submissions. Donaldson and his wife then confirmed they understood the charges against them and both declined to make any verbal or written statements in relation to the charges. The court heard that Jeffrey Donaldson was now accused of 18 charges in total (increased from 11 charges): one charge of rape, four of gross indecency and 13 charges of indecent assault. His wife&#x27;s charges were also increased from four to five, specifically that she aided and abetted her husband in connection with the allegations he faced. Both defendants were then released on continuing bail to be arraigned on 10 September 2024 at Newry Crown Court.

On 10 September 2024, Donaldson and his wife both entered not guilty pleas to all charges during an arraignment hearing at Newry Crown Court. Their joint trial was set for 24 March 2025 and is expected to last for two weeks.

==Honours==
Donaldson was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2007. That entitles him to the honorific style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

In the 2016 Birthday Honours, he was appointed Knight Bachelor for political service.

<text>The Simple English Wikipedia is a modified English-language edition of Wikipedia written primarily in Basic English and Learning English. It is one of seven Wikipedias written in an Anglic language or English-based pidgin or creole. The site has the stated aim of providing an encyclopedia for &quot;people with different needs, such as students, children, adults with learning difficulties, and people who are trying to learn English.&quot;

Simple English Wikipedia&#x27;s basic presentation style makes it helpful for beginners learning English. Its simpler word structure and syntax, while missing some nuances, can make information easier to understand when compared with the regular English Wikipedia.

== History ==
Simple English Wikipedia was launched on September 18, 2001.

In 2012, Andrew Lih, a Wikipedian and author, told NBC News&#x27; Helen A.S. Popkin that the Simple English Wikipedia does not &quot;have a high standing in the Wikipedia community&quot;, and added that it never had a clear purpose: &quot;Is it for people under the age 14, or just a simpler version of complex articles?&quot;, wrote Popkin.

Material from the Simple English Wikipedia formed the basis for One Encyclopedia per Child, a project in One Laptop per Child that ended in 2014.

As of 2025, the site contains over content pages. It has more than registered users, of whom have made an edit in the past month.

== Website structure ==

The articles on the Simple English Wikipedia are usually shorter than their English Wikipedia counterparts, typically presenting only basic information. Tim Dowling of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper explained that &quot;the Simple English version tends to stick to commonly accepted facts&quot;. The interface is also more simply labeled; for instance, the &quot;Random article&quot; link on the English Wikipedia is replaced with a &quot;Show any page&quot; link; users are invited to &quot;change&quot; rather than &quot;edit&quot; pages; clicking on a shows a &quot;page not created&quot; message rather than the usual &quot;page does not exist&quot;. The project encourages, but does not enforce, the use of a vocabulary of around 1,500 commonly used English words that is based on Basic English, an 850-word controlled natural language created by Charles Kay Ogden in the 1920s.

<text>Kiasma is a contemporary art museum located on Mannerheimintie in Helsinki, Finland. Its name &quot;kiasma&quot;, Finnish for chiasma, alludes to the basic conceptual idea of its architect, Steven Holl. Kiasma is part of the Finnish National Gallery, and it is responsible for the gallery&#x27;s contemporary art collection. Its central goal is to showcase contemporary art and to strengthen its status.

==History==
The contemporary art collection began as the Museum of Contemporary Art () in 1990. In its earliest stages, the collection was housed in Ateneum.

An architectural design competition to design a building for the contemporary arts museum was held in 1992. The competition was open to architects from the Nordic and Baltic countries, in addition to which four architects or studios from elsewhere were invited to participate, though they were obliged to submit their proposals anonymously: Steven Holl from the US, Alvaro Siza from Portugal, Coop Himmelb(l)au from Austria, and Kazuo Shinohara from Japan. The competition results were announced in 1993, and the winning proposal, titled &quot;Chiasma&quot; by Steven Holl, was selected from the 516 submitted entries. The design of the building, Finnish-ized as &quot;Kiasma&quot;, underwent slight modification during the design process, but nevertheless was regarded as controversial; for instance its close proximity to the equestrian statue of Finnish President Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. Construction work began in 1996, and the museum opened in May 1998.

The museum attracted 160,000–180,000 visitors per year in 2011–2013.

Kiasma was closed for repairs in September 2014 and reopened in March 2015. In 2016, Kiasma attracted over 310,000 visitors.

== Collections ==
The collections include works by around 8,000 artists, including
Reetta Ahonen, Martti Aiha, Jan van Andersson Aken, Anders Gustaf, Antonio Rotta, Bernard Baron, Stig Baumgartner, Cornelis Pietersz Bega, Erik Snedsbøl, Nicolas Berchem, Honoré Daumier, Karel Dujardin, , , , , , Søren Dahlgaard and Risto Laakkonen.

<text>The peso (established as the &quot;peso convertible&quot;; several older currencies were also named &quot;peso&quot;) is the currency of Argentina since 1992, identified within Argentina by the symbol $ preceding the amount in the same way as many countries using peso or dollar currencies. It is subdivided into 100 &quot;centavos&quot;, but with 10 pesos being worth about 1 US cent in early 2025, smaller denominations are not issued or in normal use. Its ISO 4217 code is ARS. It replaced the austral at a rate of 10,000 australes to one peso.

Argentine currency has experienced severe inflation, with periods of hyperinflation, since the mid-20th century, with periodic change of the currency valuation to a new version at a rate ranging from 100:1 to 10,000:1. A new peso introduced in 1992, officially the &quot;peso convertible de curso legal&quot;, was worth 10,000,000,000,000 (ten trillion) pesos moneda nacional, the currency in use until 1970. Since the early 21st century, the peso has experienced further substantial inflation, reaching 289.4% year-on-year in April 2024, the highest since the current peso was introduced in the Convertibility plan of 1991.

The official exchange rate for the United States dollar valued the &quot;peso convertible de curso legal&quot; at one US dollar at its introduction in 1992, which was maintained until early 2002. Afterwards, it went from a 3:1 exchange rate with the US dollar in 2003 to 178:1 in early 2023. On 14 August 2023, the official exchange rate was fixed at ARS$350 to one US dollar; the unregulated rate valued the peso at ARS$665 to one US dollar. On 15 November 2023, the crawling peg was restored.

On 12 December 2023, following the election of president Javier Milei, economy minister Luis Caputo changed the official exchange rate to 800 pesos to the U.S. dollar from the previous 366.5, a devaluation of 54%, to be followed by a monthly devaluation target of 2% (about 27% per year). At the time, the unofficial exchange rate was around 1,000 pesos per dollar.

==History==

Amounts in earlier pesos were sometimes preceded by a &quot;$&quot; sign and sometimes, particularly in formal use, by symbols identifying that it was the specific currency in use at the time, for example &quot;100&quot; or &quot;&quot; for &quot;pesos moneda nacional&quot;. The currency introduced in 1992 was called &quot;peso convertible&quot;, simplified to just&quot;peso&quot; in 2002. A value in pesos is written with a preceding &quot;$&quot; sign only. Earlier pesos replaced currencies also called peso, and sometimes two varieties of peso coexisted, making it necessary to have a distinguishing term to use, at least in the transitional period; the 1992 peso replaced a currency with a different name, &quot;austral&quot;.

===Peso before 1826===

The &quot;peso&quot; was a name often used for the silver Spanish eight-real coin. Following independence, Argentina began issuing its own coins, denominated in reales,
&quot;soles&quot; and &quot;escudos&quot;, including silver eight-real (or sol) coins still known as pesos.

These coins, together with those from neighbouring countries, circulated until 1881.

===Peso fuerte, 1826–1881===

In 1826, two paper money issues began, denominated in pesos. One, the &quot;peso fuerte&quot; (&quot;$F&quot;) was a convertible currency, with 17 pesos fuerte equal to one Spanish ounce (27.0643 g) of 0.916 fine gold. It was replaced by the peso moneda nacional at par in 1881.

===Peso moneda corriente, 1826–1881===

The non-convertible &quot;peso moneda corriente&quot; (everyday currency) (&quot;$m/c&quot;) was also introduced in 1826. It started at par with the peso fuerte, but depreciated with time.

Although the Argentine Confederation issued 1-, 2- and 4-&quot;centavo&quot; coins in 1854, with 100 &quot;centavos&quot; equal to 1 peso = 8 reales, Argentina did not decimalize until 1881. The &quot;peso moneda nacional&quot; (&quot;m$n&quot; or &quot;$m/n&quot;) replaced the earlier currencies at the rate of 1 peso moneda nacional = 8 reales = 1 peso fuerte = 25 peso moneda corriente. Initially, one peso moneda nacional coin was made of silver and known as patacón. However, the 1890 economic crisis ensured that no further silver coins were issued.

===Gold and silver pesos, 1881–1970===

The Argentine gold coin from 1875 was the gold peso fuerte, one and two-thirds of a gram of gold of fineness 900, equivalent to one and a half grams of fine gold, defined by Law no. 733 of 1875. This unit was based on that recommended by the European Congress of Economists in Paris in 1867 and adopted by Japan in 1873 (the Argentine 5 peso fuerte coin was equivalent to the Japanese 5 yen). However, these provisions were not implemented.

The system before 1881 has been described as &quot;monetary anarchism&quot; (&quot;anarquía monetaria&quot;). Law no. 1130 of 1881 put an end to this; it established the monetary unit as the &quot;peso oro sellado&quot; (&quot;stamped gold peso&quot;), a coin of of gold of fineness 900 (90%), and the silver peso, of silver of fineness 900. Gold coins of 5 and 2.5 pesos were to be used, silver coins of one peso and 50, 20, 10 and 5 centavos, and copper coins of 2 and 1 centavos.

===Peso moneda nacional, 1881–1970===

The depreciated &quot;peso moneda corriente&quot; was replaced in 1881 by the paper peso &quot;moneda nacional&quot; (national currency, (&quot;m$n&quot; or &quot;$m/n&quot;)) at a rate of 25 to 1. This currency was used from 1881 until January 1, 1970. The design was changed in 1899, and again in 1942.

Initially the peso m$n was convertible, with a value of one &quot;peso oro sellado&quot;. Convertibility was maintained off and on, with decreasing value in gold, until it was finally abandoned in 1929, when m$n 2.2727 was equivalent to one peso oro.

===Peso ley, 1970–1983===

The &quot;peso ley 18.188&quot; (ISO 4217: ARL) (informally called the &quot;peso ley&quot;) replaced the previous currency at a rate of 1 peso ley to 100 pesos moneda nacional.

===Peso argentino, 1983–1985===

The &quot;peso argentino&quot; (&quot;$a&quot;) (ISO 4217: ARP) replaced the previous currency at a rate of 1 peso argentino to 10,000 pesos ley (1 million pesos m$n). The currency was introduced just before the return of democracy, on June 1, 1983. However, it rapidly lost its purchasing power, was devalued several times, and was replaced by a new currency called the austral in June 1985.

===Austral, 1985–1991===

The &quot;austral&quot; (&quot;₳&quot;) (ISO 4217: ARA) replaced the peso argentino at a rate of 1 austral to 1,000 pesos (one billion pesos m$n). During the period of circulation of the austral, Argentina suffered from hyperinflation. The last months of President Raul Alfonsín&#x27;s period in office in 1989 saw prices increase constantly (200% in July alone), reflected in a worsening exchange rate. Emergency notes of 10,000, 50,000 and 500,000 australes were issued, and provincial administrations issued their own currency for the first time in decades. The value of the currency stabilized two years after President Carlos Menem was elected.

===Peso convertible, since 1992===

In 1992 a new peso (ISO 4217: ARS) was introduced, referred to as &quot;peso convertible&quot; since the international exchange rate was fixed by the Central Bank at 1 peso to 1 U.S. dollar, and for every &quot;peso convertible&quot; circulating, there was a US dollar in the Central Bank&#x27;s foreign currency reserves. It replaced the austral at a rate of 1 peso = 10,000 australes. After the various changes of currency and dropping of zeros, one peso convertible of 1992 was equivalent to 10 trillion pesos moneda nacional of 1970.

After the financial crisis of 2001, the fixed exchange rate system was abandoned in January 2002, and the exchange rate fluctuated, up to a peak of four pesos to one dollar (a 75% devaluation) at the time. The resulting export boom produced a massive inflow of dollars into the Argentine economy, which helped lower their price. For a time the administration stated and maintained a strategy of keeping the exchange rate at between 2.90 and 3.10 pesos per US dollar, in order to maintain the competitiveness of exports and encourage the replacement of imports by local industries. When necessary, the Central Bank issues pesos and buys dollars in the free market (sometimes large amounts, of the order of 10 to per day) to keep the dollar price from dropping, and had amassed over in reserves before the payment to the International Monetary Fund in January 2006.

The effect of this may be compared to the neighboring Brazilian real, which was roughly on par with the Argentine peso until the beginning of 2003, when both currencies were about three per U.S. dollar. The &quot;real&quot; started gaining in value more than the peso due to Brazil&#x27;s slower build-up of dollar reserves; by 29 December 2009, a &quot;real&quot; was worth almost 2.2 pesos.

In December 2015, US dollar exchange restrictions were removed in Argentina following the election of President Mauricio Macri. As a result, the difference between the official rate and the unofficial &quot;blue&quot; rate almost disappeared for a time.

The official exchange rate was on 1 April 2016 of 14.4 to . The rate gradually worsened; on 29 July 2022 one U.S. dollar was quoted at 131.22 pesos at the official rate and 298 pesos, 2.27 times higher (+127%), in unregulated markets.
By September 2023, the official exchange rate had reached 350 pesos to the dollar, and over 720 pesos on unregulated markets.

On 12 December 2023, following the election of president Javier Milei, economy minister Luis Caputo changed the official exchange rate to 800 pesos to the dollar from the previous 366.5, a devaluation of 54%, to be followed by a monthly devaluation target of 2%. At the time, the unofficial exchange rate was around 1,000 pesos per dollar.

==Coins==

In 1992, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavo coins were introduced, followed by 1 peso in 1994. Two-peso coins were introduced in 2010. One-centavo coins were last minted in 2001. In 2017 a new series of coins was issued in denominations of and , followed by and in 2018. While they are still legal tender, they are not accepted in stores and bank branches due to their negligible value and inconvenience in storage.

===Commemorative coins===

Commemorating the National Constitutional Convention, 2 and 5-peso nickel coins were issued in 1994.

2 peso coins were issued in 1999 to commemorate the centenary of the birth of writer Jorge Luis Borges, with Borges portrayed on the obverse and a labyrinth and the Hebrew letter aleph on the reverse. On September 18, 2002, a 2-peso coin with Eva Perón&#x27;s face was introduced to commemorate the 50th anniversary of her death; this coin was to replace the AR$2 banknote if inflation continued to be high. None of the 2-peso coins are widely circulated.

Some other 50-centavo and 1-peso coins commemorate different events, including the 50th anniversary of the creation of UNICEF (1996); the attainment of voting rights by women (1997); the establishment of Mercosur (1998); and the death of José de San Martín (2001).

Several 1 peso coins were issued in 2010 to commemorate the bicentennial of the May Revolution, all featuring the same obverse, different from the main series, and images of different places on the reverse, including Mar del Plata, the Perito Moreno Glacier, Mount Aconcagua, the Pucará de Tilcara, and El Palmar.

==Banknotes of the peso convertible (since 1992)==

===First series (&quot;Convertibles&quot;, 1992)===
In 1992, the first series of peso convertible banknotes were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 pesos. The 1-peso note was replaced by a coin in 1994. Until 2001 banknotes bore the legend &quot;Convertibles de curso legal&quot;, meaning that their value was fixed to the same amount in US dollars. As most older bills have been replaced, it is rare to find ones marked as convertible except in the $100 denominations. All bills are 155 × 65 mm in size.

===Second series (&quot;Nuevo diseño (New design)&quot;, 1997)===
Introduced in 1997. In the issues following the year 2002, the term &#x27;peso convertible de curso legal&#x27; was removed from the banknotes as established by Law 25.561. These banknotes remain in use, coexisting with later series, .

The 2-peso banknotes were withdrawn from circulation on April 30, 2018, being replaced by coins of the same denomination from the first and second series of coins. Similarly, the 5-peso banknotes were withdrawn from circulation on February 29, 2020.

===Third series (&quot;Tenemos Patria (We have a country)&quot;, 2013)===
Introduced in 2013. These banknotes remain in use, coexisting with later series, .

All the banknotes of this series were announced with a title that identifies them: 5 pesos &#x27;San Martín. The Dream of the Great Homeland&#x27;, 10 pesos &#x27;Manuel Belgrano. High in the Sky&#x27;, 20 pesos &#x27;Juan Manuel de Rosas. Heroes of the Paraná&#x27;, 50 pesos &#x27;Malvinas Islands. A Sovereign Love&#x27;, 100 pesos &#x27;Eva Perón. A Moment Towards Eternity&#x27;, and 100 pesos &#x27;Memory, Truth, and Justice. A Path to Identity&#x27;.

On April 4, 2016, it was announced that the series of 100-peso banknotes featuring María Eva Duarte de Perón would be extended with the letters AA, and it also includes a new security feature on its sides for people with visual impairments.

5-peso notes were removed from circulation 29 February 2020.

===Fourth series (&quot;Native Fauna of Argentina&quot; series, 2016)===

In 2016, the Banco Central de la República Argentina issued a new series of banknotes, with the 200- and 500-peso banknotes as the newest denominations. New 20- and 1,000-peso notes were issued in 2017, and new banknotes of 50 and 100 pesos were issued in 2018. A new series of coins in denominations of $1, $2, $5, and $10 was issued from 2018. These banknotes remain in use, coexisting with later series, .

==== 5,000-peso design concept ====
The design concept of a banknote of 5,000 pesos was shown on 16 May 2020. The note was not issued, but the design was used for the $2,000 note announced in February 2023.

===Fifth Series (&quot;Heroínas y héroes de nuestra historia&quot; – &quot;Heroines and heroes of our history&quot;, 2023)===

In May 2022, the Banco Central de la República Argentina (&quot;Central Bank of the Argentine Republic&quot;) announced a new series of 100-, 200-, 500-, and 1,000-peso notes, replacing the animal motifs of the 2016 series with pictures of Argentine historical figures and events while maintaining the color scheme, to be released within the following six months; however, no plans to put these designs into circulation have been made as of May 2023. In March 2023 a $2,000 note was issued, portraying the Instituto Malbrán and pioneering doctors Cecilia Grierson and Ramón Carrillo. It does not have a security thread, and uses the design and plates originally intended for the $5,000 note described in May 2020. The new $2,000 note was put into circulation on 22 May 2023.

On 11 January 2024, the Central Bank announced that it would issue 10,000-peso and 20,000-peso notes by June 2024. The design that was for the 500-peso note will be used for the 10,000-peso instead.

As of early 2024, the banknotes most often used were of 1,000, 2,000, and 10,000 pesos. Because of extremely high inflation, ten-, twenty-, and fifty-peso banknotes no longer circulated, and even 100-, 200-, and 500-peso banknotes were seldom seen.

Cancelled notes (planned but not issued):

Current notes:
==Exchange rates==

At the end of 2011, exchange control measures were implemented, which managed to reduce capital flight by 85%. One consequence of these measures was the appearance of multiple exchange rates and a parallel market (colloquially called the &quot;blue dollar&quot;), which was accessed by individuals and companies.

Special official exchange rates are sometimes created and abolished, to support sectors of the economy. There has been a &quot;soybean dollar&quot;, a special rate for soybean exports, that was applicable between 5 and 30 September 2022, between 20 November and 30 December 2022, again between 8 April and 31 May 2023, and again from 5 September to 25 October 2023. A &quot;corn dollar&quot; for corn exports existed between 25 July and 31 August 2023.

On 4 November 2022 a &quot;foreign tourist dollar&quot; rate close to the black market rate (355 pesos to the dollar instead of the official 195 at the end of February 2023) was introduced, for purchases made with foreign payment cards. This was to encourage people to visit the country while discouraging them from using the currency black market. Tourist dollars spent in January 2023 were nearly five times as many as in January 2022.

<text>Josiah Robins Bonner Jr. (born November 19, 1959) is an American academic administrator and former politician who currently serves as the fourth president of the University of South Alabama. He was previously the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party. He resigned from Congress on August 2, 2013, to take a job with the University of Alabama. He served as Chief of Staff to Alabama governor Kay Ivey from 2019 to 2021, before becoming the president of the University of South Alabama. He was officially inaugurated in December 2021.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Bonner was born in Selma, Alabama, but was reared in Camden, Alabama, to Josiah Robins Bonner and the now deceased Imogene Virginia Lyons. He graduated in 1982 with a degree in journalism from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.

Two years later he started working as campaign press secretary for U.S. Congressman Sonny Callahan, a Republican representing Alabama&#x27;s 1st congressional district. In 1989, Bonner was promoted to Callahan&#x27;s chief of staff and moved to Mobile.

Bonner has served as a member of the board of directors for the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, Rotary Club, Leadership Mobile, and the Mobile Chapter of the University of Alabama Alumni Association. In 2000, the College of Communications at the University of Alabama honored him as their Outstanding Alumnus in Public Relations. He was a member of Leadership Mobile, Class of 2000, where his classmates elected him co-president.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;2002
Callahan did not run for reelection in 2002, and Bonner entered the race to succeed him. He ranked first in the crowded seven-way Republican primary with 40% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win outright. In the run-off election Bonner defeated Tom Young, chief of staff to U.S. Senator Richard Shelby 62%–38%. In the general election, he defeated Democrat Judy Belk with 61% of the vote. However, he had effectively clinched a seat in Congress with his primary victory. The 1st is one of the most Republican districts in Alabama and the South, and has been in Republican hands without interruption since 1965. Bonner was also endorsed by his predecessors, Callahan and Jack Edwards.

;2004–2010
During this time period, Bonner never won re-election with less than 63% of the vote. He even ran unopposed in 2008 and 2010.

;2012
After redistricting, Bonner decided to run for a sixth term. In the Republican primary, he drew three opponents. For the third election in a row, no other party even put up a candidate, meaning that whoever won the primary would be all but assured of election.

An anti-incumbent super PAC called the Campaign for Primary Accountability spent $21,000 to try to unseat Bonner. Bonner told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;obviously, when the Supreme Court made their decision to open up corporate war chests, this is the result.&quot; Bonner said he believed he would survive the primary challenge because his campaign expenditures far exceed the money being spent against him. &quot;If I hadn&#x27;t had $1 million in my account, I could be underwater right now,&quot; said Bonner. According to Federal Election Commission records, Bonner spent $650,000 on his re-election campaign. His three opponents spent a combined total of under $275,000. No Democratic candidates have filed to run against Bonner in the general election.

Bonner won the Republican primary with 56% of the vote. He won all of the counties in the district.

===Tenure===
Bonner was somewhat conservative by national standards, but moderate by Alabama Republican standards. Perhaps his most notable dissension was his opposition to on-shore liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals for Mobile, but went on to propose an off-shore option for the future. He pushed for Callahan&#x27;s seat on the House Appropriations Committee but did not carry the support of his colleagues. Bonner hosted the Gulf Coast Congressional Report from 2003 to 2006, when the program was halted in response to an equal-time complaint by Vivian Beckerle, Bonner&#x27;s opponent in the 2006 election.

Prior to being sworn into the 108th Congress, Majority Whip Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, named Bonner an Assistant Whip. The appointment made Bonner one of a number of freshmen who were part of weekly leadership meetings with Blunt, the second-ranking member in the Republican Leadership behind only the Majority Leader. On December 14, 2005, Bonner voted for the reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act. On June 29, 2005, he voted for a $25 million increase in funding for anti-marijuana print and television ads. On October 6, 2005, he voted for the Department of Homeland Security. On July 13, 2006, he was one of thirty-three votes against renewal of the Voting Rights Act.

In December 2011, Bonner voted in support of H.R. 10, the &quot;Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act,&quot; which would have required Congressional approval for any &quot;major regulations&quot; issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president&#x27;s signature or override of a probable presidential veto.

Bonner is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

According to the website Open Congress, Bonner votes with the Republican Party 93.5% of the time. This ranked 88th among the 242 House Republicans in 2011.

Heritage Action, a conservative policy advocacy organization, reports that 55% of Bonner&#x27;s votes align with Heritage&#x27;s preferred policy stances.

Bonner has received a 0% on the legislative scorecards for NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Human Rights Campaign, and the American Civil Liberties Union. The American Conservative Union gave him an 86% evaluation in 2013.

In 2008, following Bonner&#x27;s appointment to the Appropriations Committee, free-market advocacy group FreedomWorks called on Bonner to accept a personal one-year moratorium on accepting earmarks. A FreedomWorks statement said that &quot;Representative Bonner has a long history of securing earmarks for his district, and voting in favor of egregious pork projects on the House floor.&quot;

Bonner has declined to join the Tea Party Caucus, saying, &quot;I try not to get involved in caucuses that make me look like a radical, right-wing nut. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the Tea Party is, but I want to avoid the appearance.&quot;

In 2007, Bonner voted to increase the federal minimum wage. In 2008, he voted in favor of TARP, the financial bail out package. Bonner voted against Republican-supported regulations on the credit-card industry and the Cash for Clunkers program. Bonner supported the Iraq war and opposed a timetable for withdrawal of American troops. He supports warrantless wiretapping. Bonner supports amending the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage and he voted against repealing &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell.&quot; In the summer of 2011, Bonner voted to raise America&#x27;s debt ceiling.

In March 2013, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; reported that in August 2012 Bonner and his wife took a $16,214.66 trip to a private 66,000-acre ranch in Kenya, paid for entirely by the International Conservation Caucus Foundation. The ranch is owned by members of the Wildenstein family and was the filming location of the 1985 film &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. Bonner said that the trip was for the purposes of researching a link between illegal wildlife poaching and Al-Qaeda.

==Chief of Staff to the Governor of Alabama==
After Steve Pelham, the then-chief of staff to Alabama governor Kay Ivey, took a job with Auburn University, Bonner was announced as Pelham&#x27;s replacement in January 2019. In a press release, Ivey said of Bonner, &quot;Steve has been a close friend and a trusted confidant for a number of years and has provided our office with outstanding leadership.&quot; Bonner officially took office as chief of staff following Ivey&#x27;s inauguration for a full term as governor. Bonner left the position in 2021 to become president of the University of South Alabama, and was succeeded by Liz Filmore.

==Academic career==
Bonner resigned from the U.S. Congress in 2013 to become the vice chancellor of government relations and economic development for the University of Alabama.

In November 2021, Bonner, while serving as chief of staff to Governor Kay Ivey, was announced as the next president of the University of South Alabama, following the retirement of Tony Waldrop. Bonner faced skepticism from some faculty and alumni over his political background; in response, Bonner stated, &quot;all I can ask of those who still have doubts and concerns is to meet me halfway and give us a chance to show what we can do by working together.&quot; Bonner was officially inaugurated as the university&#x27;s fourth president on December 2, 2021. Bonner has a base salary of $525,000, over three times his congressional salary at the time of his resignation.

==Personal life==
Bonner is married to Janée Lambert of Mobile. They are parents of a daughter, Jennifer Lee, and a son, Josiah Robins, III. The Bonners make their home in Mobile and are members of St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church. His sister Judy served as the President of the University of Alabama from 2012 to 2015.

Bonner is a member of the Reformers Caucus of Issue One.

<doc id="407887" wikidata="Q965794" url="?curid=407887" title="Terry Everett">
<text>Robert Terry Everett (February 15, 1937 – March 12, 2024) was an American politician and a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Alabama&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. He served from 1993 to his retirement in 2009.

On September 26, 2007, Everett announced his intention to retire at the end of the 110th Congress after the 2008 elections. He was succeeded by Bobby Bright, the first Democrat to represent the district since William Louis Dickinson won it during the Barry Goldwater landslide in Alabama in 1964.

==Early life==
Everett was born on February 15, 1937, in Dothan, Alabama, the son of Bob and Thelma Everett. He lived and attended school in Midland City, Alabama. Upon graduation from high school in 1955, Everett joined the U.S. Air Force and was assigned to the U.S. Air Force Security Service&#x27;s 6901st Special Communication Group as an intelligence analyst from 1955 to 1959. He served as analyst for reconnaissance aircraft flights including the Lockheed U-2 which, as a congressman, he protected from defunding.

== Journalism career ==
Everett began a career in journalism after leaving the air force. He began as a reporter for the &quot;Dothan Eagle&quot; then became publisher and editor of the &quot;Graceville News&quot; and the &quot;Hartford News Herald&quot;. In 1966, Everett started weekly newspapers &quot;Down Home Today&quot; in Dothan and &quot;Daleville Today&quot; in Daleville. Everett expanded his weeklies to include &quot;The Enterpriser&quot; and &quot;The Army Flier&quot; at Fort Rucker (now Fort Novosel). He later expanded into publishing dailies with &quot;The Daily Ledger&quot; in Enterprise and &quot;The Aurora Advertiser&quot; in Aurora, Missouri. In 1983, his business reached its peak when he founded Gulf Coast Media, and he became owner-publisher of the &quot;Baldwin Times&quot;, &quot;Robertsdale Independent&quot;, &quot;Fairhope Courier&quot;, &quot;Foley Onlooker&quot;, &quot;Gulf Shores Islander&quot;, &quot;Spanish Fort Bulletin&quot;, and the &quot;Union Springs Herald&quot;.

Everett sold all of his newspaper holdings except the &quot;Union Springs Herald&quot; in 1988. Later, he owned and operated Premium Homebuilders, a residential construction company in Enterprise. By the late 1980s, Everett had become a prominent businessman and community leader in the Wiregrass. He established Everett Land Development and served as president and chairman of the board of the Alabama Press Association, chairman of the board for Dothan Federal Savings Bank, president of the Daleville Chamber of Commerce, and member of the Environment Protection Commission for the Southeastern Region of the United States. He sold the &quot;Union Springs Herald&quot; in 2003.

== U.S. House ==


=== Elections ===


In 1992, Bill Dickinson announced his retirement from Congress, having served the 2nd District since 1964. It was widely expected that the race to succeed him would be between Democratic State Treasurer George Wallace, Jr., the son of the former governor, and Republican State Senator Larry Dixon from Montgomery. However, Everett upset Dixon in the Republican primary, winning by 15 points largely by dominating the area of the district outside Montgomery. In November, Everett defeated Wallace by just under two points (3,500 votes). Everett was likely helped by redistricting changes that moved many of the district&#x27;s African American residents, particularly in Montgomery and Selma, to the 7th District to create a minority-majority district. Previously, Dickinson had only won a 14th term in 1990 by only two points. The district reverted to form in the 1994 Republican wave, and Everett was reelected with 73 percent of the vote. He was reelected six more times after that with no substantive opposition.
===Tenure===
Like his predecessor Dickinson, Everett was one of the most conservative members of the House. He had the highest lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union of any member of the Alabama delegation. He showed a concern about local issues and demonstrated a real impact on some issues that are vital to his constituency. In 1995, he formed a Peanut Caucus and on the Agriculture Committee pushed for reform of the peanut program as part of the Freedom to Farm Act (which included a 10 percent cut in the support price).

During the 2002 Farm bill, Everett chaired the Specialty Crops and Foreign Agriculture Programs Subcommittee, which placed him in a strong position to advocate the interests of peanut farmers. When the 30 percent peanut subsidy finally lost congressional support, he managed to secure passage of a $3.5 billion program to buy back quota owned by peanut farmers, similar to reforms to the dairy program.

Everett also worked on military and veterans&#x27; issues (the 2nd District includes Fort Novosel and Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base). As a Veterans&#x27; Affairs subcommittee chairman in 1999, he helped secure a $1.7 billion increase for veterans&#x27; health care spending and the opening of four new national cemeteries.

As chair of the Veterans&#x27; Affairs subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Everett garnered national attention in the fall of 1997 for revealing that former Ambassador M. Larry Lawrence had improperly secured a burial waiver at Arlington National Cemetery. After checking a list of political donors who had received Arlington burial waivers from the Bill Clinton White House, Everett&#x27;s investigation found that Lawrence had lied about his military record to qualify for the waiver. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on December 17, 1997: &quot;On that note, it looked as though the mini-scandal would end as an oratorical draw, or even a Republican setback. But the Republicans reacted to White House anger by digging into Mr. Lawrence&#x27;s background. In early December, a House panel headed by Everett discovered that there was no record that Mr. Lawrence was aboard the ship Horace Bushnell, as he and the White House had claimed. That discovery revived Republican accusations that perhaps the Administration had granted a favor to a wealthy donor after all. But for once a politician warned against instant judgment. &quot;I urge everyone to avoid hasty conclusions,&quot; Mr. Everett said.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on December 12, 1997: &quot;Mr. Lawrence probably would have stayed at Arlington forever if it were not for a group of Congressional Republicans led by Representative Terry Everett of Alabama, who last summer began investigating whether the Clinton White House had sold burial plots to generous campaign contributors.&quot;

In 1998, Congressman Everett received the &quot;Excellence in Programmatic Oversight Award&quot; from the House Republican Leadership for his Veterans&#x27; Affairs Subcommittee probe into improper burial waivers at Arlington National Cemetery.

In 2005 Everett became the first chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, which was created to place national strategic assets – nuclear weapons, intelligence, satellites and missile defense systems – under one authorizing Subcommittee with an annual budget of fifty billion dollars. He focused on improving space acquisition and procurement programs and beginning a national debate on space protection. Everett spearheaded key legislative initiatives in national security space, including development of a space protection strategy, management of the space cadre and space acquisition personnel, and establishment of the Operationally Responsive Space Office.

His tenure as chairman of this subcommittee mirrored his interests, focus, and method of operation, particularly as national security issues took prominence in the last four years of his terms. Everett held frequent hearings and classified briefings on space control, threats, acquisition and procurement challenges, space cadre, and space policy.

Projects and concepts that he promoted included missile defense systems; improved global position systems (GPS); intelligence collection systems; nuclear security policy; Cobra Judy AN/SPQ-11, a ship-based ballistic missile and space-tracking radar; Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT); the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) to replace aging and expensive-to-maintain Cold War-era nuclear weapons; the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), an effort to reach deeply buried fortified missile launch sites; and the National Space Studies Center. Congress did not enact TSAT, RRW, or RNEP legislation.

Reflecting back to his service with the USAFSS Everett was particularly interested in maintaining the nation&#x27;s superiority in high-altitude reconnaissance. When the Air Force attempted to replace the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft with the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk in 2005, Everett inserted language in both the House Defense authorization bill and the House Select Intelligence Panel authorization bill which prohibited the Air Force from retiring the U-2 aircraft unless the Secretary of Defense certified there would be no loss of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. This legislation proved prescient as the Global Hawk experienced development challenges and schedule delays, and the Air Force realized it needed to continue relying on the U-2 to support its worldwide intelligence needs. When Republicans on the House Intelligence Panel attempted to defund the classified spacecraft Boeing X-37 program, Everett led the panel&#x27;s Democratic members and two of his fellow Republicans to kill the defunding amendment. He also defeated a Republican amendment to halt funding for Cobra Judy in the Intelligence Committee.

In October 2006, the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance honored Congressman Everett for his support of missile defense overall and for funding research and development of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system. In September 2008, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) presented him its Gold Medal for his support of Nuclear Security.

Everett&#x27;s retirement was brief. Within weeks after he left Congress, he was invited to the White House to discuss the Schriever V Space War Games with members of the United States National Security Council, Air Force Space Command and the intelligence community. Subsequently, Everett became the first active or retired member of Congress to participate in an Air Force space war game, and was appointed to the role of President of the United States (POTUS). Over five hundred experts from the United States, Britain, Canada, and Australia were involved in the different working cells, each of which used a &quot;whole of government&quot; approach to strategize about how to posture against possible attacks on America&#x27;s space systems. Everett&#x27;s role as POTUS was to rule on final decisions made in the executive cell.

Following Schriever V, Everett was appointed as one of the four senior advisors to the Air Force Space Command&#x27;s Space Protection Program in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Then in 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appointed him to the Department of State&#x27;s International Security Advisory Board (ISAB) where he was a member of the Pakistan/South Asia study group. When Secretary Clinton resigned in 2013, Everett resigned from ISAB, but newly appointed Secretary of State John Kerry &quot;respectfully declined&quot; Everett&#x27;s resignation. Kerry urged Everett to continue serving as a member of the Board working on &quot;some of our most important diplomatic and international security challenges&quot;.

In 2006, he voted against extending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 because of the House&#x27;s failure to adopt an amendment that would have based the law on current data. Everett&#x27;s opposition to the VRA extension was detailed in YellowhammerPolitics.com:
&quot;I am disappointed that the House chose not to update the 1965 Voting Rights Act when it reauthorized the measure,&quot; Everett argued. &quot;The whole debate was cast as either you&#x27;re for the Voting Rights Act or you&#x27;re not. There was no attention paid to the fact that the Act&#x27;s formulas are out of date and place the Act itself at risk of constitutional challenge. As a result, states like Alabama continue to be punished for wrongs committed 40 years ago and the same criteria will remain in effect for another 25 years, through 2032. The Voting Rights Act remains locked in a time-warp reflecting the voting realities of 1964, not 2006. The very constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act may be in question,&quot; he added. &quot;The Supreme Court found more than 30 years ago that the Act&#x27;s formula, which is based on the 1964, 1968 and 1972 presidential election voting data, was constitutional because it was temporary and narrowly tailored to address a specific problem. Thirty years have since passed calling into question the basis of this ruling.&quot; The 1965 comments made by Everett concerning the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act were used by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 when it ruled against parts of the Act.

On June 16, 2006, he voted against a resolution setting a timeline for withdrawal from Iraq.

In February 2007, Everett co-sponsored a house bill with Ron Paul of Texas to end United States membership in the United Nations.

In an October 2006 &quot;New York Times&quot; Op-ed piece, &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; journalist Jeff Stein revealed that despite Everett&#x27;s being vice-chairperson of the House intelligence subcommittee on technical and tactical intelligence, Everett did not know the ideological and religious differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Stein wrote that he posed a question to Everett: &quot;&#x27;Do you know the difference between a Sunni and a Shiite?&#x27;... Mr. Everett responded with a low chuckle. He thought for a moment: &#x27;One&#x27;s in one location, another&#x27;s in another location. No, to be honest with you, I don&#x27;t know. I thought it was differences in their religion, different families or something.&#x27;&quot; After Stein explained some of those differences to the congressman, Everett responded, &quot;Now that you&#x27;ve explained it to me, what occurs to me is that it makes what we&#x27;re doing over there extremely difficult, not only in Iraq but that whole area.&quot;

<doc id="407888" wikidata="Q693238" url="?curid=407888" title="Mike Rogers (Alabama politician)">
<text>Michael Dennis Rogers (born July 16, 1958) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the U.S. representative for since 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party. Rogers is the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee where he served as the Ranking Member from 2021 to 2023 and as the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee from 2019 to 2021.

==Early life and education==
A sixth-generation resident of Calhoun County in East Alabama, Rogers graduated from Saks High School and earned both his undergraduate degree in political science and Master&#x27;s of Public Administration at Jacksonville State University. He graduated from Birmingham School of Law.

== Early political career ==
At age 28, Rogers became the youngest person to join the Calhoun County Commission. In 1994, Rogers won a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives, and became minority leader in his second term.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
===Elections===
In 2002, U.S. Representative Bob Riley was elected governor of Alabama, leaving Alabama&#x27;s 3rd congressional district seat open. Rogers won the Republican nomination. In the general election, he faced Democratic veteran Joe Turnham, Jr., who had served three years as state party chairman and had run against Riley for Congress in 1998. The Democratic and Republican national parties targeted the district, with Speaker Dennis Hastert promising Rogers a seat on the Armed Services Committee should he win. Rogers outspent Turnham, raising and spending $1,656,290 to Turnham&#x27;s $1,015,132, and held an even greater margin in independent expenditures. Rogers defeated Turnham, 50% to 48%. In this election, he was a rare Republican endorsee of &quot;The Anniston Star&quot;.

====Campaign contributions from ARMPAC====
Rogers received campaign contributions from former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay&#x27;s ARMPAC. DeLay was convicted of felony money laundering of campaign finances and conspiracy to launder money. As of August 2016, Rogers has not offered to return any of the $30,000 he received. Rogers said that DeLay is innocent until proven guilty, and that he would not return the money &quot;while the judicial process runs its course&quot;.

=== Tenure ===
====112th Congress (2011–2013)====
In December 2011, Rogers voted in support of H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, which would have required Congressional approval for any &quot;major regulations&quot; issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president&#x27;s signature or override of a probable presidential veto.

====115th Congress (2017–2019)====
In 2017, Rogers worked with Representative Jim Cooper on a proposal to establish a Space Corps under the Department of the Air Force. The proposal passed the House and failed in the Senate. A bill with very similar language was signed into law two years later to create the United States Space Force. Rogers has been a major proponent of the Space Development Agency and taking an aggressive approach to space militarization.

In August 2017, Rogers held a town hall event in Oxford, Alabama, focused on efforts to repeal to the Affordable Care Act. During the town hall, a constituent raised questions about campaign donations to Rogers and his wife Beth, a Calhoun County District Court judge. The constituent specifically asked about monetary contributions to the Rogerses from Mike Hubbard, who was convicted of ethics violations in 2016. Rogers said that Hubbard was a family friend and appeared to threaten the constituent, saying, &quot;you keep my wife out of this and be a man or we&#x27;ll take it outside&quot;. The constituent said he filed a complaint with the Oxford police department over Rogers&#x27;s comments.

====117th Congress (2021–2023)====
Rogers was at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, when it was attacked. The next day, he tweeted, &quot;there is no place for political violence in America&quot; and called for law and order. Even after the attack, Rogers supported efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, voting to oppose the certification. He voted against impeaching Donald Trump a second time in the wake of the attack. His rationale for his decision was that the impeachment was a partisan action by Nancy Pelosi that would &quot;further divide our nation&quot;.

Rogers voted against the American Rescue Plan in February 2021. His rationale for opposing the bill was that it was full of &quot;extreme socialist initiatives&quot; and too expensive, and that it was too soon for another bill after the December 2020 Consolidated Appropriations Act. He also said the bill did not support schools reopening and that it funded abortions.

As of October 2021, Rogers had voted in line with Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 10.3% of the time.

====118th Congress (2023–2025)====
During the January 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, Rogers suggested that committee assignments be stripped from representatives who did not vote for Kevin McCarthy. He told &quot;Politico&quot; that his comments were more than a threat, saying &quot;I promised it&quot;. Rogers called the representatives voting against McCarthy &quot;legislative terrorists who have no problem killing the hostage&quot;.

During the 14th ballot for Speaker, Rogers lunged at Representative Matt Gaetz after Gaetz spoke with McCarthy. Representative Richard Hudson then had to physically restrain Rogers. The Associated Press reported that Rogers &quot;charged&quot; at Gaetz before Hudson pulled Rogers back by the shoulder, then the face. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Gaetz was seeking a subcommittee chairmanship in the House Armed Services Committee, of which Rogers was in line to become chair. Multiple representatives criticized Rogers after the confrontation, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said it was &quot;out of line&quot; and expected consequences for Rogers, and Tim Burchett, who compared Rogers&#x27;s actions to being under the influence of alcohol on the House floor, saying &quot;people shouldn&#x27;t be drinking, especially when you&#x27;re a redneck, on the House floor&quot;. Burchett later retracted his comments about Rogers, saying that they were made out of frustration and that &quot;we&#x27;re all friends&quot;.

During an appearance on Fox News on January 8, 2023, Gaetz said that he had forgiven Rogers for the outburst and that he was looking forward to working with Rogers on the House Armed Services Committee. Gaetz also said he did not think Rogers should be punished for an &quot;animated moment&quot;. Later that day, Rogers tweeted a message of reconciliation in response to Gaetz, saying that he regretted losing his temper on the House floor and that he would be happy to continue his working relationship with Gaetz.

On January 9, 2023, multiple media outlets reported that Rogers was planning to step down from the House Steering Committee in the wake of the controversy. Rogers confirmed to &quot;Politico&quot; that he was considering the decision, but said it had not yet been finalized; &quot;1819 News&quot; reported that Rogers &quot;may change his mind&quot;. Less than 12 hours later, Rogers said he would not resign from the committee, saying that both Republican and Democratic leaders had urged him not to. &quot;Politico&quot; called Rogers&#x27;s reversal an example of the &quot;dishevelment&quot; in the House following McCarthy&#x27;s election to the speakership.

Following the first indictment of Donald Trump in March 2023, Rogers called the proceedings a &quot;sham&quot; and called for the resignation of district attorney Alvin Bragg.

In April 2023, as chair of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, Rogers delivered statements urging advancement of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) missile program in support of Taiwan against the Chinese Communist Party. &quot;1819 News&quot; published a report showing that Lockheed Martin, which is competing for the contract to build the NGI missiles, is Rogers&#x27;s largest campaign contributor. Rogers has a history of advocating for arms development under Lockheed Martin, including similar comments from January 2023 for Lockheed artillery weapons to be supplied to Ukraine. He never served in the military.

During the October 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, after the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker, Rogers called those who had supported McCarthy&#x27;s ouster &quot;traitors&quot; and accused them of &quot;paralyzing&quot; the House of Representatives. Rogers initially refused to support Jim Jordan for Speaker of the House, even after he had been nominated by Republicans for the speakership. Rogers told reporters that he was willing to compromise with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to nominate a bipartisan moderate speaker instead of Jordan. Rogers&#x27; comments were met with scrutiny by conservative colleagues, including Senator Mike Lee from Utah and former U.S. representative Mo Brooks from Alabama. Additionally, members of the Alabama Republican Party state executive committee, including members from the third district, threatened to file a challenge against Rogers&#x27; ballot access in the 2024 election. On October 16, 2023, Rogers issued a statement endorsing Jordan for Speaker of the House, reversing his position and establishing his support for Jordan. In the statement, Rogers said that he had &quot;always been a team player&quot; and would support the Republican conference&#x27;s decision on the speakership.

Upon Trump&#x27;s 2024 re-election to a non-consecutive term as president, Rogers was reportedly contacted by Trump&#x27;s transition team as a potential nominee for Secretary of Defense.

===Committees===
For the 118th Congress:
* Committee on Armed Services (Chair)
**As Chair of the full committee, Rep. Rogers is entitled to sit as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittee meetings per the committee rules.

=== Caucus memberships ===
* Congressional Cement Caucus
*United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
* Veterinary Medicine Caucus
* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
* Republican Study Committee

==Political positions==

In 2020, Rogers received a lifetime rating of 86% from the American Conservative Union, one of the most moderate voting records of a Southern Republican that year. He supported an amendment to declare that people retain the right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage, and traditions on public property, including schools. He co-sponsored legislation to prohibit the physical desecration of the U.S. flag. Rogers sponsored a bill expressing Congress&#x27;s continued support for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education.

===Abortion===

<doc id="407889" wikidata="Q672671" url="?curid=407889" title="Robert Aderholt">
<text>Robert Brown Aderholt ( ; born July 22, 1965) is an American politician and attorney serving as the U.S. representative for since 1997. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes most of Tuscaloosa County north of the Black Warrior River, as well as Birmingham&#x27;s far northern suburbs in Walker County and the southern suburbs of Huntsville and Decatur.

A social conservative, Aderholt was a member of the Tea Party Caucus. He became the dean of Alabama&#x27;s congressional delegation following Senator Richard Shelby&#x27;s retirement at the end of the 117th Congress. According to the Cook Partisan Voting Index, Aderholt represents the most Republican district in the country, with an index rating of R+33.

== Early life and education ==
Aderholt was born in Haleyville, Alabama, to Mary Frances Brown and Bobby Ray Aderholt. Aderholt&#x27;s father, a part-time minister for a small group of Congregational churches in northwest Alabama, was a circuit judge for more than 30 years. He attended the University of North Alabama and then Birmingham-Southern College, from which he graduated with a degree in history and political science. During college, Aderholt was a member of Kappa Alpha Order. Aderholt received his J.D. from the Samford University Cumberland School of Law and practiced law after graduation.

==Career==
In 1992, Aderholt was appointed Haleyville municipal judge. The same year, he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. In 1995, he became the top aide to Governor Fob James. He won the 1996 Republican primary in the race to succeed 15-term Democratic incumbent Tom Bevill.

As the Republican nominee, Aderholt faced a considerable challenge against State Senator Bob Wilson Jr., who called himself a Democrat &quot;in the Tom Bevill tradition&quot;. This was a seriously contested race, receiving considerable national coverage and significant support from the Republican Party. Newt Gingrich personally visited the district during the campaign. Aderholt won, 50%–48%, becoming only the second Republican to represent the district since Reconstruction. Two years later, he was reelected over Tom Bevil, Jr., his predecessor&#x27;s son. The first Republican to win the seat had been Jim Martin, who was swept into office in what was then the 7th District during the 1964 wave that delivered the state&#x27;s electoral votes to Barry Goldwater. After his first win, Aderholt has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been reelected nine times. He ran unopposed in 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2016. His increasing margins reflected the growing Republican trend in this part of Alabama.

Aderholt is associated with the Fellowship Foundation, which paid for his trip to Romania in 2017 to promote &quot;traditional family values&quot;. Over the course of 16 years, Aderholt traveled to 18 countries on the Fellowship&#x27;s behalf.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===
Aderholt is one of 147 Republican lawmakers who voted to overturn results in the 2020 presidential election. He was at the Capitol to certify the election results when it was attacked. During the attack, he tweeted a prayer to God to &quot;guide &amp; protect this nation.&quot; In a video message, he later said that some of the attackers &quot;crossed the line&quot;. Even after the attack, he supported overturning the election. Aderholt later opposed impeaching Trump for the second time.

In February 2021, Aderholt voted against the American Rescue Plan, claiming that his opposition was because half the bill&#x27;s funding went to &quot;unrelated liberal policies&quot; and that the bill &quot;has nothing to do with COVID-19 relief&quot;.

As of October 2021, Aderholt had voted in line with Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 7.5% of the time.

In January 2023, Aderholt announced that he had secured $13.8 million in funding for 14 infrastructure projects in his district, including broadband expansion, roadways and access to medical care. Although announced during the 118th Congress, the funds were from the previous House session.

In February 2023, &quot;CoinDesk&quot; reported that Aderholt is one of three members of Alabama&#x27;s congressional delegation who received money from FTX, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange, alongside Katie Britt and Gary Palmer. His office did not respond to a &quot;CoinDesk&quot; inquiry about what had been done with the funds.

Aderholt voted to provide Israel with support following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

==Political positions==
The American Conservative Union&#x27;s center for legislative accountability gave Aderholt a 83% lifetime conservative rating and the progressive PAC Americans for Democratic Action gave him a 5% liberal quotient in 2019.

=== Abortion ===

During the March for Life in Washington on January 22, 2010, Aderholt said, &quot;The issue of abortion and the sanctity of life is something that I feel strongly about and I encourage my colleagues to look for ways to curb and stop abortions in the United States, while compassionately educating on this important issue.&quot; Aderholt supported the 2022 overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and called it a &quot;watershed moment for life&quot;.

===Budget and economy===
Aderholt opposes reducing the defense budget to close the American deficit, and in May 2012 said &quot;cuts to defense budgets – the federal government&#x27;s primary Constitutional responsibility – shouldn&#x27;t be the relief valve for uncontrolled domestic program spending&quot;.

During the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis, Aderholt voted for the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. Aderholt called the debt-ceiling deal between Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden &quot;a step in the right direction&quot;, though he also said it was &quot;not perfect&quot;.

=== Civil rights ===

Aderholt opposes same-sex marriage. Aderholt condemned the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the US constitution. He has received high ratings from the Family Research Council, the Traditional Values Coalition, and the American Family Association. In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign gave him a score of 0 on its Congressional Scorecard.

===Environment===
During the 111th Congress, Aderholt voted for Steve Scalise&#x27;s amendment to &quot;require that Congress be allowed to vote on any executive regulation that would impose any tax, price, or levy upon carbon emissions... effectively prevents the executive branch from levying any form of carbon tax without Congressional approval. Since a carbon tax would be tremendously destructive to the economy as a whole, this measure would hopefully make such a tax unlikely to pass.&quot; Aderholt opposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and in December 2008 helped write a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that read, &quot;I am opposed to any attempt to impose greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act on the agricultural industry.&quot;

===Gun policy===
Aderholt supports gun rights. He has been repeatedly endorsed by the NRA Political Victory Fund, and received $2,000 in 2010.

In the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Aderholt called it a terrorist attack and said, &quot;we do not have the luxury of debating the political correctness of &#x27;radical Islam&#x27;&quot;, adding that there was a need to &quot;hunt down those who would do us harm&quot;. He opposed the media and President Obama using the shooting to &quot;push any type of political agenda relating to gun control&quot; and called on the White House and Congress to &quot;protect the homeland&quot;.

===Health care===

In 2019, Aderholt introduced a bill to raise the minimum age to purchase tobacco to 21.

===Regulatory reform===
In December 2011, Aderholt voted in support of H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, which would have required congressional approval for any &quot;major regulations&quot; issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president&#x27;s signature or override of a probable presidential veto.

===Tax policy===
Aderholt is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge. He voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying it would &quot;give back more money to Alabama taxpayers&quot; and &quot;does the right thing&quot;. He cited the raising of the child tax credit, changes to the state and local tax deductions, and said, &quot;more than 80% the people in the 4th District of Alabama will receive a tax cut.&quot; Aderholt also said that more businesses will stay in the U.S. due to a lower corporate tax rate and therefore the act is a &quot;jobs bill&quot;.

===&quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;===
In December 2020, Aderholt was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.

===Defense===
In September 2021, Aderholt was among 75 House Republicans to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act of 2022, which contains a provision that would require women to be drafted.

<text>Robert Edward &quot;Bud&quot; Cramer Jr. (born August 22, 1947) is an American politician and was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from 1991 to 2009, representing . On March 13, 2008, Cramer announced he would not seek re-election to a 10th term.

==Early life==
Cramer was born and raised in Huntsville, Alabama. Known as Bud by his classmates, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1969 and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1972. After graduating, he joined the Army as a tank officer. He served at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and remained a member of the Army Reserve from 1976 to 1978.

== Early political career ==
In 1973, Cramer was appointed assistant district attorney in Madison County, a position he held until going into private practice in 1975. He remained in private practice until 1980, when he challenged the incumbent Madison County District Attorney and won at age 33.

In 1985, he founded the National Children&#x27;s Advocacy Center, a child-friendly environment for abused children, an effort for which he was honored at the White House by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.

== Congress ==
=== Congressional elections ===
Cramer was district attorney from 1981 to 1990, until Rep. Ronnie Flippo ran unsuccessfully for governor. Cramer ran for the vacant Congressional seat in 1990, defeating Republican Al McDonald with 67% of the vote. He was handily reelected in 1992. However, he was nearly defeated in 1994 by Republican businessman Wayne Parker—the closest that a Republican had come to winning one of the few remaining districts (prior to 2010) in the former Confederacy to have never elected a Republican since Reconstruction. Cramer only held onto his seat by 1,770 votes. Cramer managed to defeat Parker with less difficulty in 1996 and never faced serious opposition again, winning five more terms by over 70 percent of the vote before running unopposed in 2006.

=== Tenure ===
In the House, Cramer was a supporter of the International Space Station and an advocate for spending increases in missile defense, as Huntsville has long been a center for research and development of these two projects, as Redstone Arsenal—located in the district—is home of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) and NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center.

A liberal in his early days, he largely supported the Democratic line for his first three terms. The 1994 near-defeat, however, led Cramer to move more to the right in his voting. He often broke with his party on issues such as abortion, gay rights, gun control, taxes, regulation of business, and the environment. Cramer was one of only four Democrats in the House to vote for the tax cut bill of 2003. However, unlike a few other conservative Democrats, he did not vote in favor of any of the articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton.

Cramer&#x27;s voting record placed him near the center of the House; however, he was often cited as unpredictable in his votes. Child protection was a longtime legislative project of Cramer&#x27;s pursuant to his work with the area prior to his ascent to the House.

Cramer was a long-time member of the Blue Dog Democrats, a coalition of conservative and moderate House Democrats. Because of his largely conservative positions, he was encouraged by fellow Alabama politician Sen. Richard Shelby to make the same switch that he did and register as a Republican. Cramer resisted these efforts, and won reelection easily in his increasingly conservative district despite his party affiliation.
On October 10, 2002, Cramer was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He also voted in favor of some measures favored by the Republican majority, including the continued occupation of Iraq and re-authorization of the Patriot Act. However, Cramer joined fellow Democrats in opposing President Bush&#x27;s plan to send 21,000 additional troops to Iraq.

== Retirement ==
On March 13, 2008, Cramer surprised colleagues by announcing that he would not seek re-election in 2008 and would retire at the end of his term. Alabama’s Democratic State Senator Parker Griffith defeated Republican Wayne Parker in the race to succeed Cramer. 

Since leaving Congress, Cramer has worked as a lobbyist and government affairs consultant, representing clients in the defense and aerospace industries.

<text>Spencer Thomas Bachus III (born December 28, 1947) is an American politician. He is a former U.S. Representative for the state of Alabama, serving from 1993 to 2015. A member of the Republican Party, he served as ranking member (2007–2011) and chairman (2011–2013) of the House Financial Services Committee. On September 30, 2013, Bachus announced his retirement from Congress. His term ended in 2015.

Born and raised in Birmingham, Bachus graduated from Auburn University and the University of Alabama Law School. He served in the Alabama National Guard before being elected to the Alabama State School Board in 1986 and holding the position of Alabama Republican Party Chairman in 1991. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992, and was re-elected by wide margins. From 2006 to 2012, Bachus was the leading Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, serving as committee chairman when his party held a House majority during the 112th Congress. Due to House Republican term limits on committee leadership positions, Bachus was succeeded by Congressman Jeb Hensarling in 2013.

==Early life, education, and career==
Bachus was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the son of Edith (née Wells) and Jim Bachus Jr. He graduated from Auburn University in 1969 where he became a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He served in the Alabama National Guard from 1969 to 1971, during the Vietnam War, while attending law school; Bachus earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Alabama Law School in 1972. Prior to his political career, he owned a sawmill and practiced law until 1992.

==State politics==
In 1982, Bachus was elected to the Alabama Senate. Because new legislative elections were scheduled for 1983, he served only one year. In 1983 he was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives. In 1986, he was elected as the first Republican to the Alabama State Board of Education, serving one four-year term representing the 6th District. In 1990, he ran unsuccessfully for Attorney General of Alabama. In 1991, he became Chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, serving in that position until his campaign for Congress.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Summary===
From 2006 to 2012, Bachus was the leading Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, serving as committee chairman when his party held a House majority during the 112th Congress. Due to House Republican term limits on committee leadership positions, Bachus was named Chairman Emeritus of the Financial Services Committee and rejoined the Judiciary Committee, which he had to take leave of when named Financial Services Chair.

On September 30, 2013, Bachus announced his retirement from Congress. His term ended in January 2015.

Upon his retirement in 2014, Norman Ornstein wrote a column in the &quot;National Journal&quot; lamenting the &quot;Exodus of Problem Solvers on Capitol Hill.&quot;

===Elections===
Alabama&#x27;s 6th congressional district was redistricted based on the 1990 United States Census. In the 1992 election, Bachus defeated incumbent Democrat Ben Erdreich. Bachus was endorsed by &quot;The Birmingham News&quot;. Bachus got a major assist from redistricting, which drew most of Birmingham&#x27;s black neighborhoods into the majority-black 7th district, replacing them with suburban and Republican territory around Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. The new 6th was almost 97 percent white; in contrast, the old 6th was 35 percent black. Despite being outspent almost 2 to 1, the 7th&#x27;s more Republican bent was enough to give Bachus the victory by seven points. He was undoubtedly helped by George H. W. Bush winning the district by over 30 points.

Bachus would never face another contest nearly that close. No Democrat even filed from 2000 to 2010; before then, he defeated three nominal Democratic challengers with over 70 percent of the vote each time.

In the 2004 Republican primary, Bachus defeated Phillip Jauregui, a member of former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore&#x27;s legal team. Bachus was unopposed in the 2004 general election.

In the 2010 midterm elections, Bachus easily turned back a challenge from pastor Stan Cooke in the Republican primary, winning 75% of the vote.
Bachus sought reelection in 2012 after the 6th was redrawn to cut out its share of Tuscaloosa. In the Republican primary, he drew three challengers, most notably State Senator Scott Beason. Beason ran well to Bachus&#x27;s right and called for &quot;true conservative leadership.&quot; Bachus heavily outspent him. The incumbent spent over $1.5 million, outspending Beason 45–1. Bachus defeated him 59%–27%. He won every county in the district except for Blount County.

For the first time since 1998, Bachus faced a Democratic challenger. Colonel Penny Bailey defeated William Barnes to become the Democratic nominee. However, the new 6th was as heavily Republican as its predecessor, and Bachus turned back this challenge fairly easily, defeating Bailey with 71 percent of the vote.

===Tenure===
Bachus had a conservative voting record, with a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union. He was a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

Bachus was an active legislator, engaged in many important issues over the course of his congressional career. He helped amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to curtail identity theft and ease consumer access to their credit reports. Bachus also had a reputation for good constituent service.

;1990s

In the late 1990s, during his tenure as Chairman of the Banking Oversight Committee, he uncovered the Community Development Financial Institute (CDFI), which led to the resignation of the top two CDFI officials.

In the 1990s he became an advocate of international debt relief for the Third World, and joined a broad coalition of activists in a one-day fast to demand action, which was ultimately successful. He criticized the Bush administration over negotiations with the genocidal regime in Sudan, and urged Bush to stop payment of oil revenues to the Sudanese government. Bachus was credited when the Bush Administration decided, in 2007, to place sanctions on Sudan.

In 1995, Bachus pushed for the creation of the Alabama National Cemetery, a United States National Cemetery located in Montevallo, Alabama. Bachus said, &quot;The Alabama National Cemetery will always be the thing I&#x27;m most proud of... It was the second one built, and I&#x27;m so thankful for it. We now (have) veterans from every war buried there.&quot;

On November 4, 1999, Bachus voted in favor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This law repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, removing barriers in the market among banking companies, securities companies and insurance companies that prohibited any one institution from acting as any combination of an investment bank, a commercial bank, and an insurance company. With the passage of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, commercial banks, investment banks, securities firms, and insurance companies were allowed to consolidate. The legislation was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.

;2000s

While Bachus was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit (2001 – 2006), the House of Representatives passed and the President signed into law the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-159), which contained the strongest federal identity theft protections enacted into law to that date and entitled consumers to annual free credit reports from each of three major credit bureaus.

Additionally, while Bachus was Subcommittee Chairman, enacted into law was The Check Clearing for the 21st Century (CHECK) Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-100). This law authorized the use of digital versions of paper checks for transfer by financial institutions, saving money and eliminating delays and losses caused by the transportation of physical checks.

Again, as Subcommittee Chairman, Bachus played a leading role in passing the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-173), which reformed the federal deposit insurance system and raised the FDIC coverage limit for retirement accounts to $250,000.

On July 26, 2002, he voted for the Homeland Security Act of 2002 which created the United States Department of Homeland Security.

Bachus also was active in advancing the search for Natalee Holloway, who went missing while on a senior trip to Aruba. Holloway attended high school in Mountain Brook, an affluent Birmingham suburb in the congressman&#x27;s district.

In 2005, Bill Maher commented about the Army missing its recruiting goal by 42% in April, saying, &quot;More people joined the Michael Jackson fan club. We&#x27;ve done picked all the low-lying Lynndie England fruit, and now we need warm bodies.&quot; Bachus responded to Maher&#x27;s comments, saying &quot;I think it borders on treason. In treason, one definition is to undermine the effort or national security of our country.&quot;

On December 14, 2005, he voted for the reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act. The USA PATRIOT Act is an act of Congress that was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001. On May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011.

In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined &quot;unlawful Internet gambling&quot;).

In 2006, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, Bachus worked on bipartisan draft subprime mortgage reform legislation to address abuses in the lending market. According to the book &quot;Act of Congress&quot; by Robert G. Kaiser, &quot;Bachus thought that if it had passed in 2005, subprime lending would have dried up, and the Great Crash could have been avoided or at least made much less serious.&quot;

In 2008, Bachus proposed the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing, an addition to the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 that required licensing for mortgage brokers.

During deliberations on the legislative response to the Financial Crisis of 2008, Bachus, as Ranking Member on the Financial Services Committee, was one of the original proponents of the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) that the U.S. Treasury eventually adopted as the primary method of stabilizing the U.S. banking system.

As described in Robert G. Kaiser&#x27;s book &quot;Act of Congress:&quot;

At a forum entitled &quot;Five Years Later: A Financial Crisis Symposium&quot; co-hosted by the University of Chicago and the Paulson Institute on October 29, 2013, former Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank stated, &quot;Spencer Bachus gets some credit for this. In the meeting, he was the senior Republican, the leader of the Republican minority at the time, and when it was presented as buying up the assets, he was one of the first in our meetings to raise the notion of, well, how about a capital injection.&quot;

The capital purchase provision was included in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 3, 2008. According to the U.S. Treasury, in exchange for the capital funding made available to participating institutions, &quot;Treasury received stock or debt securities in exchange for those investments. Most financial institutions participating in CPP pay Treasury a five percent dividend on preferred shares for the first five years and a nine percent rate thereafter. In addition, Treasury received warrants to purchase common shares or other securities from the banks at a time of the CPP investment. The purpose of the additional securities was to enable taxpayers to recap additional returns on their investments as banks recover.&quot;

On April 9, 2009, Bachus said &quot;Some of the men and women I work with in Congress are socialists,&quot; later stating that 17 members of the House of Representatives are socialists.

;2010s

In a 2010 interview with the &quot;Birmingham News&quot;, Bachus spoke about the outlook he would bring to his chairmanship of the Financial Services Committee, saying &quot;In Washington, the view is that the banks are to be regulated, and my view is that Washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks.&quot; The comment was criticized in a blog post by &quot;ThinkProgress&quot;.

On November 4, 2010, while in the midst of a battle for the chairmanship of the House Financial Services Committee with Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA) and immediately following the 2010 general election, Bachus told the South Shelby (Ala.) Chamber of Commerce that former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and candidates she endorsed cost the Republican Party control of the U.S. Senate, saying: &quot;The Senate would be Republican today except for states (in which Gov. Palin endorsed candidates) like Christine O&#x27;Donnell in Delaware. Sarah Palin cost us control of the Senate.&quot; He went on to say that Tea Party candidates did well in U.S. House races, but in the U.S. Senate races, &quot;they didn&#x27;t do well at all.&quot;

Conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt and Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) immediately defended both Sarah Palin and the Tea Party movement, crediting them with gains in both the House and the Senate. Hewitt and Muny further demanded that Bachus not be awarded chairmanship of the House Financial Services Committee. Palin responded with criticism of the &quot;Bachus bigger government agenda,&quot; citing Bachus&#x27;s support for the Troubled Asset Relief Program and &quot;Cash for Clunkers.&quot;

In 2010, Bachus stated that &quot;ending the bailout of Fannie [Mae] and Freddie [Mac]&quot; was his top priority as Chairman of the Financial Services Committee. He said that &quot;using taxpayer money to subsidize the mortgage market is an addiction&quot; and that &quot;House Republicans want to reform the housing finance system in a way that does not rely on government guarantees, that does not make private investors and creditors wealthy while saddling taxpayers with losses, and that does not set the stage for the next financial crisis.&quot;

In 2011, the FBI and American Football Coaches Association honored Bachus for his advocacy and support for the National Child Identification Program. The National Child Identification Program tries to help combat cases of missing or abducted children by providing identification kits to parents that allow the parents or other guardians to keep their children&#x27;s fingerprints and other identifying characteristics on file at their home.

In 2012, Bachus called on Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to speed up veterans claims processing. In a letter to the Secretary, Bachus wrote that the benefit claims backlog facing veterans nationwide is causing veterans to face growing debt or postpone plans to pursue college education. He demanded that the Department outline the specific steps being taken to reduce the backlog.

In 2013, Bachus was the only member of Alabama&#x27;s congressional delegation to vote in favor of defunding the National Security Agency&#x27;s collection of phone records. Bachus has been an outspoken critic of the NSA program since news of it was leaked by Edward Snowden.

Bachus was a lead House sponsor of legislation offering federal protection to the American flag, prohibiting its desecration. On Flag Day 2013, he joined Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D-IL) to co-sponsor an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that says &quot;Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.&quot;

Bachus was credited with being a lead advocate for locating and maintaining the National Computer Forensics Institute in the City of Hoover Public Safety Building in Hoover, Alabama: &quot;The National Computer Forensics Institute was created in 2007 with money from local, state and federal entities. Since opening in 2008, it has trained 932 state and local law enforcement officers from more than 300 agencies in all 50 states, according to congressional testimony from Pablo Martinez, deputy special agent in charge of the criminal investigation division, cyber crimes operations for the U.S. Secret Service.&quot;

In a May 2013 report, the Government Accountability Office stated, &quot;As of March 31, 2013, the U.S. Department of the Treasury had received about $222 billion from its Capital Purchase Program investments, exceeding the approximately $205 billion it had disbursed. Treasury estimated at the end of December 2012 that CPP would have an approximate lifetime income of $15 billion after all institutions had exited the program.&quot;

===Insider trading accusations===
In 2007, Bachus was accused of insider trading. The Congressional Ethics inquiry stemmed from an allegation by Peter Schweizer and later reported by 60 Minutes that Bachus made trades with a number of short-term stock options, betting that stocks would fall, after receiving sensitive non-public information on the state of the economy. Schweizer claimed that from July through November 2008, Bachus traded in options at least forty times. During this period, Bachus was one of the congressional leaders getting private briefings from Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke about the worsening financial crisis. Bachus said that he &quot;never trades on non public information, or financial services stocks&quot;. He was subsequently cleared by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which on April 30, 2012, the announced that they had found no evidence of violations of insider-trading rules and recommended that the case against him be closed. Roderick Hills and Harvey Pitt, former Chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission who reviewed the accusations, wrote &quot;the original source for these allegations was a sensational, but factually inaccurate, book, followed by an adulatory (but equally inaccurate) &#x27;60 Minutes&#x27; segment about it. The allegations in the book, vis-à-vis Mr. Bachus, are inaccurate; far worse, however, is that these allegations are laughable to serious students of insider trading law.&quot;

<text>Artur Genestre Davis (; born October 9, 1967) is an American attorney and former politician who served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives for from 2003 to 2011. He was also a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Alabama in the 2010 election. After losing in the primary, he moved to Virginia and joined the Republican Party. He rejoined the Democratic Party in 2015, switched to the Republican Party again in 2016, and then back to the Democrats in 2017, in his two attempts to be elected Mayor of Montgomery, Alabama in the 2015 and 2019 elections, losing both times.

Davis was an early supporter of Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 bid for the presidency, and one of the national co-chairs for Obama&#x27;s 2008 campaign. Known for his oratorical skills, Davis made one of the nominating speeches for Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. While serving on the House Ways and Means Committee, Davis was the first African-American member of Congress to advocate that Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel give up the chairmanship of the tax committee in the wake of ethics charges against Rangel. In 2009 and 2010, Davis voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to do so.

In 2009, Davis sought to become Alabama&#x27;s first African-American Governor. In attempting to appeal to a broader electorate, he lost the support of black voters by opposing national health care reform and failing to meet with certain black political groups. He lost in the Democratic primary to Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks, a more liberal Democrat. Shortly after, Davis announced he would not be running for re-election to the House in 2010, instead returning to the practice of law.

A 1990s honors graduate of Harvard University, in 2012 Davis became a visiting fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. He also began writing a column for the conservative &quot;National Review&quot;. He considered running for Congress as a Republican in the 2014 House elections in Virginia but did not do so. A resident of Virginia from 2011 until 2014, Davis spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention in support of the Republican nominee for President, Mitt Romney. He was defeated in his two attempts to be elected Mayor of Montgomery, Alabama in the 2015 and 2019 mayoral elections.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Davis was born in Montgomery, Alabama, on October 9, 1967, and was raised by his mother and grandmother. He graduated from Jefferson Davis High School and then &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard University in 1990. He earned a J.D. &quot;cum laude&quot; from Harvard Law School before returning to Alabama. He was the recipient of the Best Oralist Award in the Ames Moot Court Competition at Harvard Law School.

After working as an intern at the Southern Poverty Law Center and then as a civil rights lawyer. He served as an Assistant United States Attorney.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;2000
Davis ran for the House in the Democratic primary against 10-year incumbent and former civil rights activist Earl F. Hilliard. He criticized Hilliard for taking a trip to Libya in 1997 despite U.S. sanctions. Davis lost the 2000 primary election 58–34%.

;2002
Davis ran again in 2002. The race attracted national attention because both candidates made the Israeli–Palestinian conflict an issue, and both attracted support and money from outside of Alabama—Davis from Jewish Americans and supporters of Israel, Hilliard from Arab-Americans and supporters of the Palestinians. During the campaign, Hilliard questioned whether Davis was &quot;black enough&quot; to represent the district. Davis narrowly won the primary requiring a runoff in June. He won the runoff easily, assuring him victory in November in the heavily Democratic district, and he began his term in January 2003.

;2004
Davis was challenged in the 2004 primary by Albert Turner Jr., a son of a leader of Selma&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; march. Davis won the primary 88%–12%.

;2006

In the Democratic primary, he defeated political newcomer Eddison Walters 90–9%. He won the general election unopposed.

;2008
In the new Democratically controlled 110th Congress, Davis was assigned to the Committee on Ways and Means. The stature of that appointment, and the difficulty of raising sufficient funds, led Davis to postpone plans to challenge conservative Senator Jeff Sessions in 2008. In January 2007, Davis said that he was still interested in running on a statewide ticket in 2010, either for Governor, or for Senate if Richard Shelby elected to retire.
In 2007 he became the first Congressman outside Illinois to endorse Senator Barack Obama for president in 2008. At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Davis gave a seconding speech formally placing Obama&#x27;s name in nomination. Davis also served as one of Obama&#x27;s national campaign co-chairs.

Davis&#x27;s name surfaced in media speculation as a potential Attorney General in Obama&#x27;s cabinet. However, Davis was quoted in &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; as stating that he did not anticipate such an offer, and would refuse it if made.

===Tenure===
As a freshman in Congress, Davis led the successful fight to reverse funding cuts for minority land grant colleges including Tuskegee University. As a second term member, Davis won a floor fight to restore funding to the HOPE VI program for renovating public housing; he persuaded over sixty Republicans to vote with Democrats. In 2005, Davis was the lead Democratic sponsor of a bill establishing a national cord blood bank which will widen the availability of blood transfusions for thousands of patients who suffer from diseases such as sickle cell anemia and diabetes. He received an A− grade on his voting record relating to veteran issues from Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

Davis was appointed to the Senior Whip Team for the Democratic Caucus of the 109th Congress and was the co-chair of the centrist House New Democrat Coalition, as well as the Southern Regional co-chair for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Davis was the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to demand that former House Ways and Means Chair Charlie Rangel surrender his gavel in the wake of an ongoing ethics investigation.

Davis twice voted against the Democratic-supported health care reform legislation, first in November 2009, and again in March 2010 when the legislation passed and was signed into law by President Obama. He was the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote against the legislation in March 2010; he was also the member from the most-heavily Democratic-leaning district to vote against the legislation.

In April 2009, Davis voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

===Committee assignments===
In Congress, Davis was a member of the House Committee on the Budget, Committee on Ways and Means, the Committee on the Judiciary and several of their subcommittees. He was a member of the 30 Something Working Group and the Congressional Black Caucus.

==2010 gubernatorial election==

On February 6, 2009, Davis announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in 2010. His opponent in the Democratic primary was state Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks.

During the primary campaign, Davis downplayed matters of race and emphasized his independence from Democratic party orthodoxy. He caused controversy, including within his heavily minority congressional district, by voting against President Barack Obama&#x27;s new health-care law—the only black Democrat in Congress to do so. He also refused to sit for the endorsement screenings of Alabama&#x27;s black political groups, drawing criticism that he was snubbing African Americans in order to court white votes. Davis lost the Democratic primary to Sparks on June 1, 2010, ending his gubernatorial bid. Birmingham News columnist John Archibald questioned Davis&#x27; strategy, saying that he campaigned &quot;as it if were a general election and he wanted to claim some conservative street cred.&quot; Archibald believed that this hurt him with Democratic primary voters in Alabama, who are &quot;blue dots in this big red state,&quot; and resulted in him becoming &quot;the first African-American candidate in a statewide Alabama race to lose the black vote.&quot; After the primary, state Representative Roderick Scott said black Democrats “can no longer take for granted they will receive the African-American vote.” Davis announced he was retiring from politics and would return to private practice at the conclusion of his term in Congress in 2011. Davis was succeeded by Democrat Terri Sewell, the first African-American woman elected to the United States House of Representatives from Alabama.

==Post-congressional career==
For a time, Davis was doubtful he would run for public office again. He said, &quot;Alabama is not friendly to independent candidacies” and suggested that running as a Republican would not be a viable option because the Alabama Republican Party had declined to embrace politicians who have switched parties such as former U.S. Congressman Parker Griffith who switched parties and lost the Republican primary in 2010. He changed his voter registration from Alabama to Virginia in 2012, and said he would run as a Republican were he to seek political office in the future.

In the Spring of 2012, he announced he would become a visiting fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. In 2012, the conservative &quot;National Review online&quot; started publishing some of his political commentary. In February 2012, Davis told Politico that some Democrats wanted to argue that Obama&#x27;s critics were motivated by racism, which Davis called &quot;a huge mistake ... a tactic that&#x27;s likely to backfire&quot; as it would lead &quot;substantial number of Americans&quot; to believe they were being called racists because they did not support Obama.

In August 2012, he cited remarks by Vice President Joe Biden for &quot;racial viciousness&quot; for remarks Davis said were insulting to African Americans, and said, &quot;Governor Romney is absolutely right as the Obama campaign is running a divisive campaign … pitting one set of Americans against another issue after issue&quot;. Davis also said, &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if Barack Obama had not campaigned in such a different way.&quot; Davis spoke at the Republican National Convention in August 2012 to voice additional criticisms of Barack Obama. Following Mitt Romney&#x27;s loss in the 2012 presidential election, Davis said: &quot;The Republican conservative base seems perilously close to shrinking to white southern evangelicals, senior white males, and upper income Protestants.&quot;

In December 2013, it was announced that Davis would not run for retiring Republican Congressman Frank Wolf&#x27;s seat in Virginia. Davis had previously expressed interest in running for Wolf&#x27;s seat after his move to the state.

In late June 2014, it was reported that Davis was considering running for Mayor of Montgomery, Alabama, in 2015. On July 18, 2014, Davis announced that he would launch an exploratory campaign for a mayoral run. On January 22, 2015, he officially declared his candidacy as a Democrat. On August 25, 2015, Artur Davis was defeated in the mayoral election by incumbent mayor Todd Strange. Following this loss, Davis expressed interest in running for the Montgomery County Commission in 2016 as a Democrat. However, the Alabama Democratic Party refused to allow Davis on the ballot, as he had supported a Republican candidate for office within the past four years.

Davis was also a candidate for Mayor of Montgomery in the August 2019 mayoral election, but lost again, winning 1,784 votes and placing sixth of twelve candidates.

<text>Donald Edwin Young (June 9, 1933 – March 18, 2022) was an American politician from Alaska. He is the longest-serving Republican in House history, having been the U.S. representative for the state&#x27;s at-large congressional district for 49 years, from 1973 until his death in 2022.

Born and raised in California, Young moved to Alaska in 1959 after a stint in the U.S. Army. He worked various careers, including sailing and teaching, in the small city of Fort Yukon, where he was elected mayor in 1964. He entered state politics two years later, when he won a seat in the Alaska House of Representatives, and advanced to the Alaska Senate in 1970. In 1972, he ran for a seat in the House of Representatives against incumbent Democrat Nick Begich. Weeks before the election, Begich disappeared and was presumed dead in a plane crash, though he still (likely posthumously) won the vote. Young ran in a special election to fill the vacant post the following year, defeating Democrat Emil Notti. He was re-elected to the seat 24 times.

In Congress, Young chaired the House Resources Committee from 1995 to 2001 and the House Transportation Committee from 2001 to 2007. The Associated Press said that he was known for his &quot;brusque&quot; and &quot;off-color&quot; demeanor, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as having &quot;cultivated the image of a rugged frontiersman&quot;; his prominent personality, long tenure, and position as his state&#x27;s sole House member led to him occasionally being dubbed &quot;Alaska&#x27;s third senator&quot;.

Young became the 45th dean of the United States House of Representatives in December 2017, after John Conyers resigned. He was the first Republican in that office in more than 84 years.

==Early life, education, and teaching career==
Donald Edwin Young was born on June 9, 1933, in Meridian, Sutter County, California, the second of three sons of Russell Lawhead &quot;Cy&quot; Young Sr. and Arlene Marcella Bucy. He earned an associate&#x27;s degree in education from Yuba College in 1952 and a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Chico State College in 1958. He served in the Army from 1955 to 1957.

Young moved to Alaska in 1959, not long after it became a state. He settled in Fort Yukon, then a city of 700 on the Yukon River, seven miles above the Arctic Circle in Alaska&#x27;s central interior region. He made a living in construction, fishing, trapping, and gold mining. He captained a tugboat and ran a barge operation to deliver products and supplies to villages along the Yukon River. At the time of his death, Young still held his mariner&#x27;s license. During winters, he taught fifth grade at the local Bureau of Indian Affairs elementary school.

==Early political career==
Young&#x27;s political career began in 1964, when he was elected mayor of Fort Yukon, serving until 1968. He ran for the Alaska House of Representatives in 1964, but finished tenth, with the top seven candidates being elected for the multi-member district.

He was elected to the State House in 1966 and reelected in 1968. Young served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1967 to 1971.

He said he &quot;loved&quot; the job before he &quot;got ambitious&quot; and ran for the Alaska Senate in 1970. He served in the Alaska Senate from 1971 to 1973. He was elected to the two-member District I alongside long-serving Republican State Senator John Butrovich. He said he &quot;hated&quot; the state senate. After encouragement from his first wife, he ran for Congress in 1972.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

In 1972, Young ran for Congress against incumbent Democrat Nick Begich. Weeks before the election, Begich and Representative Hale Boggs died in a fatal plane crash, but Begich&#x27;s name remained on the ballot and he won the election. Begich&#x27;s body was never found, and he was declared legally dead in December 1972.

Young won the resulting special election to fill the seat in March 1973. He was reelected 24 times, usually without significant opposition, although he faced strong challenges in the 2008 primary election and in the 1974, 1990, and 1992 elections.

He won his 2016 primary with more than 70% of the vote, and defeated Democrat Steve Lindbeck and Libertarian Jim McDermott in the general election with 50% of the vote to win his 23rd term in office. Young won again in 2018, against candidate Alyse Galvin, whose party was undeclared, taking 52.6% of the vote.

Young was the most senior U.S. Representative and, after Jim Sensenbrenner retired, the last member who had been in office since the 1970s. He was the second-highest-ranking Republican on the Natural Resources and Transportation and Infrastructure committees. He chaired the former from 1995 to 2001 and the latter from 2001 to 2007.

Young was the subject of an extensive FBI investigation but was not charged with wrongdoing. He was subsequently the subject of a House Ethics Committee probe.

====1972–1974====

Democratic State Senator Nick Begich was elected to the House of Representatives in 1970 to succeed Republican Howard Pollock, who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for governor of Alaska. Young ran against Begich in 1972 and placed second in the August 22 open primary with 13,958 votes (25.60%) to Begich&#x27;s 37,873 (69.45%). Begich was lost in a plane crash on October 16, 1972 (along with House Majority Leader Hale Boggs of Louisiana), 22 days before the general election. Although his body was never found, Begich won the general election with 53,651 votes (56.24%) to Young&#x27;s 41,750 (43.76%). He was declared dead on December 29.

Young ran in the special election on March 6, 1973, and defeated Democrat Emil Notti, 35,044 votes (51.41%) to 33,123 (48.59%). He won a full term in 1974 with 51,641 votes (53.84%) to Democratic State Senator Willie Hensley&#x27;s 44,280 (46.16%). He was sworn into the House of Representatives on March 14, 1973. He credited his victory to his leadership of the fight for the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System.

====1976–2006====

Young was reelected with at least 55% of the vote in each of the next seven elections. He defeated former State Senator Eben Hopson with 71% of the vote in 1976, State Senator Patrick Rodey with 55.4% of the vote in 1978, Kevin &quot;Pat&quot; Parnell with 73.8% of the vote in 1980, and Dave Carlson with 70.8% of the vote in 1982.

In 1984 and 1986, Young defeated Nick Begich&#x27;s widow, Pegge Begich, 113,582 votes (55.02%) to 86,052 (41.68%), and 101,799 votes (56.47%) to 74,053 (41.08%), respectively. He defeated Peter Gruenstein with 62.5% of the vote in 1988 and then faced John Devens, the mayor of Valdez, in 1990 and 1992. Young defeated him by 99,003 votes (51.66%) to 91,677 (47.84%) in 1990 and then faced a serious challenge in 1992. He was challenged in the Republican primary by State Senator Virginia M. Collins and defeated her by 24,869 votes (52.98%) to 19,774 (42.12%). In the general election, he defeated Devens, 111,849 votes (46.78%) to 102,378 (42.82%). This was both the lowest winning percentage of his career and the only time he won without a majority of the vote.

Young defeated former Alaska Commissioner of Economic Development and 1992 Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Tony Smith with 56.92% of the vote in 1994, State Senator Georgianna Lincoln with 59.41% of the vote in 1996, and State Senator and former Speaker of the Alaska House of Representatives Jim Duncan with 62.55% of the vote in 1998. He defeated attorney Clifford Mark Greene with 69.56% of the vote in 2000 and with 74.66% of the vote in 2002, the largest winning percentage of his career. He received 213,216 votes (71.34%) against Thomas Higgins in 2004, the most votes he ever received in a single election. In 2006, he defeated writer, dramatist, and video production consultant Diane E. Benson with 56.57% of the vote.

====2008====

Incumbent Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell announced his candidacy in the August 26 Republican primary. Parnell was strongly supported by Governor Sarah Palin and the Club for Growth. Young was endorsed by Mike Huckabee&#x27;s political action committee, Huck PAC, in June.

Young won by 304 votes (0.28%), and Parnell declined to seek a recount. Before the announcement of the unofficial results, both candidates had said that they would request a recount if they lost. The state of Alaska pays the costs of recounts when the difference is within a half percent, as it was in this primary election.

Young faced a challenge from Democrat Ethan Berkowitz, the 46-year-old former minority leader in the Alaska House of Representatives. Don Wright, the Alaskan Independence Party nominee, also challenged Young. Young was reelected with 50% of the vote to Berkowitz&#x27;s 45% and Wright&#x27;s 5%. Berkowitz conceded on November 18.

====2010–2020====
In 2010, Young ran for a 20th term. He was challenged in the Republican primary by John R. Cox and Sheldon Fisher, a former telecommunications executive, winning with 74,117 votes (70.36%). He defeated Democratic State Representative Harry Crawford in the general election, 175,384 votes (68.96%) to 77,606 (30.51%).

In 2012, Young drew two challengers in the Republican party, but defeated them with 58,789 votes (78.59%). In the general election, he defeated State Representative Sharon Cissna by 185,296 votes (63.94%) to 82,927 (28.62%).

In 2014, Young received 79,393 votes (74.29%) in the Republican primary against three challengers. In the general election, he defeated Democrat Forrest Dunbar, 142,572 votes (50.97%) to 114,602 (40.97%). Young was the only statewide incumbent in Alaska to win reelection that year, as Republican Governor Sean Parnell was defeated by Independent Bill Walker, and Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Begich was defeated by Republican Dan Sullivan.

In 2016, Young received 38,998 votes (71.5%) in the Republican primary against three challengers. In the general election, he won with 50.32% of the vote against Democratic challenger Steve Lindbeck with 36.02% and Libertarian Jim McDermott with 10.31%.

In 2018, Young defeated Alyse Galvin, an Independent candidate who had won the combined Alaska Democratic Party, Alaska Libertarian Party and Alaskan Independence Party primary. He received 53.08% of the vote to Galvin&#x27;s 46.5%.

In 2020, Young ran for a 25th term. He won the Republican primary with 77% of the vote in a three-way race. In the general election, Young again defeated combined-ticket nominee Alyse Galvin with 54.4% of the vote.

===Tenure===
At the start of the 116th Congress, Young was the longest-serving current House member. Due to his long tenure in the House and that of former Senator Ted Stevens, Alaska was considered to have had clout in national politics far beyond its small population (it is the 4th smallest, ahead of only North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming). He was often called &quot;Alaska&#x27;s third senator&quot;. On March 5, 2019, he became the longest-serving Republican in congressional history, surpassing Joe Cannon.

====1990s====
After the 1995 Republican takeover of the House, Young chaired the Committee on Natural Resources, which he renamed the Committee on Resources. The name was changed back by Democrats in 2006 and has since been retained by Republican chairs. He chaired the committee until 2001, then chairing the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure from 2001 to 2007.

During a 1994 House debate touching on the question of Alaska Natives&#x27; right to sell sex organs of endangered animals as aphrodisiacs, he pulled out an 18-inch penis bone of a walrus, better known as an &quot;oosik&quot;, and brandished it like a sword on the House floor at the face of the head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

In March 1998, Young brought a bill to the House floor allowing voters in Puerto Rico to vote on continuing its commonwealth status or becoming either a state or independent. The legislation passed by a single vote.

====2000–2010====
In the 2005 Highway Bill, Young helped secure $941 million for 119 special projects, including a $231 million bridge in Anchorage named Don Young&#x27;s Way.

In 2007, Young was investigated as a part of the Alaska political corruption probe for his ties to the oil and gas company VECO Corporation. He faced no charges.

In July 2007, Representative Scott Garrett proposed an amendment to strike money in a spending bill for native Alaskan and Hawaiian educational programs. Young defended the funds on the House floor, saying, &quot;You want my money, my money&quot; and &quot;Those who bite me will be bitten back.&quot; He also suggested that conservative Republicans such as Garrett lost the Republicans their majority in the 2006 election by challenging spending earmarks, and made several critical remarks about Garrett&#x27;s state, New Jersey. Garrett did not ask for an official reprimand, but other conservative Republicans took exception to Young&#x27;s claim that the funds in question were &quot;his&quot; money. Members of the conservative Republican Study Committee gave Garrett a standing ovation later in the day during the group&#x27;s weekly meeting and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina compared Young&#x27;s earmarks to &quot;legal theft&quot;.

In 2008, the United States Department of Justice investigated Young&#x27;s role in steering $10 million into a Florida transportation project. In 2010, the investigation concluded with no charges against Young. In 2011, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a lawsuit seeking information on the investigation. Some documents were subsequently released, and a judge ordered the federal government to pay CREW $86,000 in legal fees.

In 2010, when Democrat Charles Rangel of New York was censured for ethical violations, Young and Representative Peter T. King were the only two Republicans voting against censure.

====2011–2020====
In the 112th Congress, Young signed Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

In 2012, Young endorsed then-Representative Mazie Hirono in the Democratic primary for the United States Senate.

In March 2013, the House Ethics Committee created a special committee to investigate allegations that Young had improperly accepted gifts, used campaign funds for personal expenses, failed to report gifts in financial disclosure documents, and made false statements to federal officials. Young said, &quot;it will go forever. I&#x27;ve been under a cloud all my life. I&#x27;m sort of like living in Juneau. It rains on you all the time. You don&#x27;t even notice it.&quot; In 2014, the committee rebuked Young after finding he had failed to disclose gifts totaling over $60,000 between 2001 and 2013.

In March 2013, Young used the ethnic slur &quot;wetbacks&quot; during a radio interview to describe Latino migrants who worked at his father&#x27;s ranch when he was growing up. He issued a statement later that day saying that he &quot;meant no disrespect&quot; and that he &quot;used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in central California&quot;. Young later formally apologized for his remarks, saying, &quot;I apologize for the insensitive term&quot; and that &quot;it was a poor choice of words.&quot;

In May 2016, Young wrote a letter to the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives stating that for 25 years he had failed to disclose his inherited interest in a family farm in California on which he and other family members had signed oil and gas leases; Young said the omissions to his financial reporting were accidental.

On May 4, 2017, though he had indicated two months earlier that he would oppose repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he voted for its repeal. Governor Bill Walker said Alaska &quot;would be the most negatively affected if the proposed legislation is signed into law as is. Alaskans already pay the highest health care premiums in the country.&quot; U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski opposed the removal of the provision in the act that eliminated discrimination against those with preexisting conditions, saying it was not &quot;what Alaskans are telling me they think is an acceptable response.&quot; It was estimated that annual policy costs for coverage under the state&#x27;s exchange would rise by $12,599.

In 2017, former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives John Boehner told &quot;Politico&quot; that Young had once pinned him against a wall inside the House and held a 10-inch knife to his throat.

In September 2017, during a House floor debate on an amendment to the 2018 government spending package for wildlife management and national preserves in Alaska, Young made critical comments about Representative Pramila Jayapal, including calling the 51-year old Jayapal &quot;young lady&quot; and saying that she &quot;doesn&#x27;t know a damn thing what she&#x27;s talking about&quot; and that her speech on the amendment &quot;was really nonsense. It was written by an interest group&quot;. The exchange led to a temporary suspension of proceedings: upon their resumption, Young acknowledged in an address to the floor that his comments were &quot;out of order&quot; and apologized to Jayapal; she accepted.

Georgetown University&#x27;s McCourt School of Public Policy rated Young among the most bipartisan members of Congress for the 115th and 116th Congresses.

====2021–2022====

On May 19, 2021, Young introduced H.R.3361, the United States Ambassador at Large for Arctic Affairs Act of 2021, which would create a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed Ambassador at Large for Arctic Affairs who would represent the U.S. in matters relating to the Arctic before international bodies of which the U.S. is a member, foreign nations, and multilateral negotiations. No votes have been held on the bill. On November 5, 2021, Young was among the 13 House Republicans to break with their party and vote with a majority of Democrats for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Former president Donald J. Trump castigated the 13 House Republicans who voted for the bill.

At the time of his death, he was the oldest and longest-tenured member of Congress.

== Political positions ==
=== Abortion ===
Young believed that abortion should be legal only when the pregnancy is a result of incest or rape or when a woman&#x27;s life is endangered by her pregnancy. Young&#x27;s views on abortion were largely anti-abortion during his congressional career: he voted for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act while making exception for maternal endangerment and favored stripping federal funds from Planned Parenthood. On the other hand, Young did not oppose using embryonic stem cells in scientific research.

=== Arctic oil drilling ===
When then-U.S. president Donald Trump signed an executive order that rolled back Obama-era restrictions on Arctic oil drilling, Young commended Trump for &quot;recognizing the importance of development in the Arctic OCS&quot;.

The Arctic Refuge drilling controversy repeatedly brought Young into the national spotlight. He was a longstanding supporter of opening lands within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. He included provisions to that effect in 12 bills that have passed the House, but environmentalists concerned with the impact of road-building, pipelines and other development on the Arctic tundra landscape blocked these efforts.

===Arts funding===
Young questioned public funding of the arts, but in his later years supported legislation increasing funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).

At an assembly at Fairbanks&#x27; West Valley High School in 1995, Young was answering questions about cutting federal funding for the arts. He said that such funding had &quot;photographs of people doing offensive things&quot;, and &quot;things that are absolutely ridiculous.&quot; When asked for an example, Young quickly replied &quot;buttfucking&quot;, in reference to Robert Mapplethorpe&#x27;s photographic exhibition &quot;The Perfect Moment&quot;. After receiving criticism for the use of that obscenity, Young explained his choice of words by saying he had tried &quot;to educate&quot; teens.

=== Bridges ===

==== &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot; ====
In 2005, Young and Stevens earmarked $223 million for building the Gravina Island Bridge from Ketchikan to Gravina Island, which also contains Ketchikan&#x27;s airport. The bridge would be used for access by emergency vehicles, as well as passengers. There is a small ferry for cars and passengers that travels the crossing in three to seven minutes and runs every half-hour. Critics assailed this as pork barrel spending at taxpayers&#x27; expense and &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Keith Ashdown, spokesman for the Taxpayers for Common Sense: &quot;It&#x27;s a gold-plated bridge to nowhere.&quot; &quot;At a time when we have bridges and roads crumbling around the United States, and traffic congestion worse than ever, why build a $200 million project that will serve only a few hundred people?&quot; The Gravina Island Bridge was awarded a Golden Fleece Award by that organization in 2003. After criticism from citizens and others in Congress, lawmakers de-funded the bridge and instead funneled the money to the Alaska Department of Transportation, allowing the governor of Alaska to build the Gravina Island Highway after the Alaska legislature funded the project with the directed monies.

==== Knik Arm bridge ====
The Knik Arm Bridge was earmarked in the bill connects Anchorage to Point Mackenzie, a lightly populated area in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough that is less than four miles (6 km) across Cook Inlet from downtown Anchorage. Anchorage is accessible from Point Mackenzie only by an route around Knik Arm, much of which was an unimproved road. The demise of this second bridge project has been suggested for years.

Part of the concern about the bridge is that if it were built, it would significantly enhance the value of property in which Young&#x27;s son-in-law owned an interest. Young was listed as the third-worst congressman by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and dubbed &quot;Mr. Pork&quot; due to his involvement in the Gravina Island &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot;.

=== Cannabis ===

Young supported a number of efforts to reform cannabis laws in Congress. In 2019 he introduced the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act. Other legislation Young introduced includes the CARERS Act in 2015 (to reschedule cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act) and the SAFE Banking Act in 2017 (to improve access to banking services for cannabis businesses). In February 2017, Young launched the Congressional Cannabis Caucus with Representatives Earl Blumenauer, Dana Rohrabacher, and Jared Polis. He toured several cannabis facilities in Alaska in October 2019.

In 2020, Young was one of only five House Republicans to vote for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act. The act aimed to &quot;correct the historical injustices of failed drug policies that have disproportionately impacted communities of color&quot;; it included provisions to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, impose a federal tax on cannabis products, and use the proceeds of the tax to fund restorative justice programs.

In 2021, Young introduced the Gun Rights and Marijuana (GRAM) Act to allow the ownership of firearms by people who use cannabis in accordance with state law. Also in 2021, Young introduced the Cannabis Reform for Veterans, Small Businesses, and Medical Professionals Act to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and direct federal agencies to develop regulations for cannabis similar to alcohol. Later in 2021 he was one of four original cosponsors of the Republican-led States Reform Act to legalize cannabis federally.

=== Civil liberties ===

Young voted for the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provided reparations for Japanese Americans imprisoned by the U.S. government during World War II. He attended Reagan&#x27;s official signing ceremony for the bill. Young also voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which clarified the 1964 civil rights act in response to several controversial U.S. Supreme Court cases.

=== Climate change ===
Young had previously said that he did not believe in anthropogenic climate change and that the idea of global warming is &quot;the biggest scam since the Teapot Dome.&quot; Despite these public statements, Young signed a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that recognized the urgency behind combating climate change, writing, &quot;We are confronting multiple and intersecting crises—the COVID-19 pandemic, an economy in turmoil, societal injustice, and, above all, the climate crisis—all of which demand swift and bold action.&quot; Young voted for the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which identifies climate change as a national security threat. In a 2019 op-ed in &quot;The Hill&quot;, Young took a conciliatory position on climate change, and called for policy changes that could reduce carbon emissions.

Young voted for the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, which included permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

Young supported exempting the Tongass National Forest from the Roadless Rule, saying, &quot;An exemption will not only bring great economic benefit to Alaska but will also help bolster the long-term health of the Tongass National Forest. The Tongass is an invaluable natural resource and it requires active management. Unfortunately, the Roadless Rule has only prevented Alaskans from responsibly utilizing our resources.&quot;

Young supported an increase in the federal gasoline tax to keep pace with the continued rise in gasoline efficiency of automobiles.

=== COVID-19 ===

At a town hall in Palmer, Alaska, on March 13, 2020, Young said of the pandemic, &quot;This is blown out of proportion about how deadly this is. He continued, &quot;It&#x27;s deadly but it&#x27;s not nearly as deadly as the other viruses we have ... I call it the hysteria concept&quot;, as well calling it the &quot;beer virus&quot; (referencing the similarly-named Corona beer). Young later clarified that he was attempting to urge calm. On March 17, 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly in the U.S., he missed the vote on a $2 trillion bill to deal with pandemic, instead attending a National Rifle Association of America fundraiser. As public awareness of the pandemic&#x27;s severity grew, Young walked back his comments. By March 25, in a video message, he said the impact of COVID-19 is &quot;very real, growing&quot;, and was reshaping our daily lives. Urging Americans to stay home, he continued, &quot;Weeks ago, I did not truly grasp the severity of this crisis, but clearly we are in the midst of an urgent public health emergency.&quot;

On November 6, 2020, Young was photographed maskless at a birthday party for a staff member in an Anchorage restaurant. Numerous well-known political operatives who attended, including former Lieutenant Governor Mead Treadwell, soon tested positive for COVID-19. On November 12, Young was diagnosed with COVID-19. He was admitted to Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage that day and released on November 15, writing, &quot;Very frankly, I had not felt this sick in a very long time, and I am grateful to everyone who has kept me in their thoughts and prayers.&quot; He confirmed to a &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporter that &quot;many&quot; of his campaign staff had been infected, as well as his wife, who he said was asymptomatic.

=== Donald Trump ===
During the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Young originally supported Jeb Bush, and later John Kasich. In April 2016, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m not supporting Donald Trump&quot;, and when asked about Trump&#x27;s success in the primaries, said that it was due to &quot;a bunch of idiots following a pied piper over the edge of the cliff&quot; and that he blamed the people who voted for Trump. By December 2016, he was more supportive of Trump&#x27;s accomplishments and proposed policies.

In September 2019, Young called the investigation and the Trump impeachment inquiry &quot;a waste of time&quot;. He voted against the first and second impeachments of Trump.

===Joe Biden===

On November 7, 2020, Young was one of the first Republicans to acknowledge and congratulate Joe Biden on his victory in the 2020 presidential election. On January 6, 2021, Young affirmed Biden&#x27;s victory by voting against the objections to counting electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania.

Young was a strong supporter of Biden&#x27;s nominee for United States Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland. He called Haaland, a Democrat, a friend and said it was &quot;a long time overdue&quot; for the U.S. to have a Native American interior secretary. Haaland asked Young to introduce her at her confirmation hearing before the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Senator Joe Manchin, a crucial swing vote, cited Young&#x27;s support of Haaland as a reason for his support.

As of October 2021, Young had voted in line with Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 30.6% of the time.

=== Environmental regulation ===
Young said he believed the Environmental Protection Agency should not regulate greenhouse gases, and that it kills jobs. He said, &quot;Environmentalists are a self-centered bunch of waffle-stomping, Harvard-graduating, intellectual idiots&quot; who &quot;are not Americans, never have been Americans, never will be Americans.&quot; But Young supported omnibus spending bills that maintain current EPA funding levels despite calls from the Trump Administration to cut such funding.

In 2019, Young and Debbie Dingell introduced legislation providing for a long-term reauthorization of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.

===Healthcare legislation===
Young said he wanted to see a clean repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but said in March 2017 that he would not vote on an earlier version of the AHCA (a healthcare plan to repeal and revise parts of the ACA) because it would have too negative an impact on health care costs in Alaska.

According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the AHCA would raise health care costs in Alaska more than in any other state, and by 2020, on average Alaskans would receive $10,243 less per year under the AHCA compared to the ACA for the same coverage, almost double the cost increase of any other state (the next being North Carolina with consumers receiving $5,360 less per year). Young said, &quot;Nothing in this new bill addressed the real problems of health care.&quot;

The AHCA would also stop the Medicaid expansion Obamacare provided, which gives health coverage to more than 27,000 of Young&#x27;s constituents, about 3.7% of the Alaska population. For those reasons, Young was a key House member preventing the AHCA from going to a vote. When the AHCA did not pass, Young said it was a &quot;victory for Alaska&quot;. But despite those statements, and being officially &quot;undecided&quot; because of the disproportionate impact on Alaskans, Young voted for the AHCA on May 4, 2017, without any significant changes to improving Alaska subsidies.

An organization called Save My Care spent $500,000 to release a series of attack ads against 24 House members who voted for the AHCA, including one about Young that decried his vote, claiming it would raise health care costs for Alaskans.

=== Gay rights ===
In 2007, Young voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (E.N.D.A.). In a 2014 debate, he said he would &quot;probably&quot; vote for E.N.D.A.

In 2015, Young was one of 60 Republicans voting to uphold President Barack Obama’s 2014 executive order banning federal contractors from making hiring decisions that discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

In 2015, Young issued a statement saying that while he believed marriage should be between a man and a woman, he recognizes that the law is settled on this issue, and stated that he accepts the Supreme Court decision ruling same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional.

In 2021, Young was one of 29 Republicans to vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This bill expanded legal protections for transgender people, and contained provisions allowing transgender women to use women&#x27;s shelters and serve time in prisons matching their gender identity.

In 2021, Young was one of 33 Republicans to vote for the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act.

=== Organized labor ===

Young frequently earned the support of organized labor, and in the 116th Congress, voted in support of the pro-union PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to certify unions, augment how employers classify laborers and prevent laborers from being denied rights on the basis of their immigration status.

=== Policing and criminal justice reform ===
Young voted to make lynching a federal crime and supported House passage of the First Step Act, which reforms sentencing laws to reduce recidivism and decrease the federal inmate population.

In the aftermath of the 2020 protests related to the murder of George Floyd, Young voted for the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, which would remove Confederate names from U.S. military installations.

Young voted for legislation authorizing the creation of a Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys. In 2020, the bill was signed into law. The commission is intended to examine societal disparities that black men and boys face at disproportionately high rates.

In 2021, Young cosponsored and voted for the EQUAL Act, which eliminates the federal sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powdered cocaine.

===Post Office===
On August 22, 2020, Young was one of 26 Republicans to vote for a $25 billion relief package for the U.S. Post Office.

=== Suicide rate in Alaska ===
When asked about the fact that Alaska has the highest per capita suicide rate in the U.S., Young said that he believed it is at least partially the result of government handouts, and that &quot;this suicide problem didn&#x27;t exist until we got largesse from the government.&quot; He believed Alaska needs to cut public assistance programs.

In response to an increase in suicides among active-duty service members at Fort Wainwright in 2019, Young called on the U.S. Army to investigate the cause of the increased suicide rate.

On October 21, 2014, Young addressed an assembly of students at Wasilla High School shortly after a student there committed suicide. During a question and answer session, he said a lack of support from family and friends had caused the student&#x27;s suicide. During the assembly, Young also recalled a story about drinking alcohol in Paris, and used profanity several times, officials from the school reported.

When a student criticized Young for his comments on suicide, Young called him an &quot;asshole&quot;. Young apologized for these comments on October 24, saying, &quot;I am profoundly and genuinely sorry for the pain it has caused the Alaskan people.&quot;

=== Missing and murdered indigenous women and girls ===

In the 116th Congress, Young helped introduce the BADGES Act to help solve the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. He was one of 33 Republicans to vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which included his amendment to help end violence against indigenous women.

=== Town halls ===
Young said he did not believe in conducting town halls (district meetings for officials to meet and speak with constituents in a town hall setting). When he was asked for a face-to-face meeting with his constituents in April 2017, an aide said, &quot;The modern town hall has taken an unfortunate turn as a &#x27;show&#x27; for the media and are [sic] unproductive for meaningful dialogue.&quot; Young&#x27;s meetings in Alaska were primarily with elected officials, business groups, service clubs, and gatherings of Republicans. On April 20, 2017, residents started a town hall meeting by themselves, speaking to Young through a video camera with a color photo of Young to represent him.

In Juneau, while speaking to the Alaska Municipal League in 2018, Young asked the crowd, &quot;How many millions of people were shot and killed because they were unarmed? Fifty million in Russia because their citizens were unarmed.&quot; Facing criticism, Young&#x27;s office insisted that his comments were taken out of context, stating, &quot;He was referencing the fact that when Hitler confiscated firearms from Jewish Germans, those communities were less able to defend themselves. He was not implying that an armed Jewish population would have been able to prevent the horrors of the Holocaust, but his intended message is that disarming citizens can have detrimental consequences.&quot;

=== Migrant detention facilities ===

In 2019, Young was the sole Republican to vote for the Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in Customs and Border Protection Custody Act, which set minimum standards for Customs and Border Patrol detention facilities, including requiring health screenings and ensuring that basic needs of detained migrants, such as access to food and water for detainees, are met.

==Personal life==
In 1963, Young married Lula Fredson, who worked as a bookkeeper in Fort Yukon. She was a Gwich&#x27;in and the youngest child of early-20th-century Gwich&#x27;in leader John Fredson. She volunteered her time serving as the manager of Young&#x27;s Washington, D.C. congressional office. They had two daughters and were members of the Episcopal Church. Lula died on August 1, 2009, at age 67.

On August 17, 2014, Young announced his engagement to Anne Garland Walton, a flight nurse from Fairbanks. They married on June 9, 2015. She was 76 years old at the time.

===Death===
On March 18, 2022, Young was on a flight from Los Angeles to Seattle while traveling to Alaska. Toward the end of the flight, he lost consciousness, and was declared dead, aged 88, after the plane landed at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. Also on the flight was his wife Anne Garland Walton and communications director Zack Brown.

Young lay in state in the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall on March 29, 2022, before his memorial service. He was the 43rd person to have this honor since 1852.

<text>Manuel José Joaquín del Corazón de Jesús Belgrano (3 June 1770 – 20 June 1820), usually referred to as Manuel Belgrano (), was an Argentine public servant, economist, lawyer, politician, journalist, and military leader. He took part in the Argentine Wars of Independence and designed what became the flag of Argentina. Argentines regard him as one of the main Founding Fathers of the country.

Belgrano was born in Buenos Aires, the fourth child of Italian businessman Domingo Belgrano y Peri and of María Josefa González Casero. He came into contact with the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment while at university in Spain around the time of the 1789 French Revolution. In 1794 he returned to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, where he became a notable member of the criollo population of Buenos Aires; he tried to promote some of the new political and economic ideals, but found severe resistance from local . This rejection led him to work towards a greater autonomy for his country from the Spanish colonial regime. At first he unsuccessfully promoted the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to become a regent ruler for the Viceroyalty during the period when the French imprisoned the Spanish King Ferdinand VII during the Peninsular War (1807–1814). Belgrano favoured the May Revolution, which removed the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros from power on 25 May 1810. He was elected as a voting member of the Primera Junta that took power after the ouster.

As a delegate for the Junta, he led the ill-fated Paraguay campaign of 1810-1811. Belgrano&#x27;s troops were beaten by Bernardo de Velasco at the battles of Paraguarí and Tacuarí. Though his army was defeated, the military campaign initiated the chain of events that led to the independence of Paraguay in May 1811. He retreated to the vicinity of Rosario, to fortify it against a possible royalist attack from the Eastern Band of the Uruguay River. While there, he developed the design of the flag of Argentina. The First Triumvirate did not approve the flag, but because of slow communications, Belgrano would only learn of that many weeks later, while reinforcing the Army of the North at Jujuy. There, knowing he was at a strategic disadvantage against the royalist armies coming from Upper Peru, Belgrano ordered the Jujuy Exodus, which evacuated the entire population of Jujuy Province to San Miguel de Tucumán. His counter-offensive at the Battle of Tucumán resulted in a key strategic victory, and it was soon followed by a complete victory over the royalist army of Pío Tristán at the Battle of Salta. However, his deeper incursions into Upper Peru ended with the defeats of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, leading the Second Triumvirate to order his replacement as Commander of the Army of the North by the newly arrived José de San Martín. By then, the Asamblea del Año XIII had approved the use of Belgrano&#x27;s flag as the national war flag.

Belgrano then went on a diplomatic mission to Europe along with Bernardino Rivadavia to seek support for the revolutionary government. He returned in time to take part in the Congress of Tucumán, which declared Argentine independence (1816). He promoted the Inca plan to create a constitutional monarchy with an Inca descendant as head of state. This proposal had the support of San Martín, Martín Miguel de Güemes, and many provincial delegates, but was strongly rejected by the delegates from Buenos Aires. The Congress of Tucumán approved the use of his flag as the national flag. After this, Belgrano again took command of the Army of the North, but his mission was limited to protecting San Miguel de Tucumán from royalist advances while San Martín prepared the Army of the Andes for an alternative offensive across the Andes. When José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López seemed poised to invade Buenos Aires, he moved his army southwards, but his troops mutinied in January 1820. Belgrano died of dropsy on 20 June 1820. His last words reportedly were: &quot;¡Ay, Patria mía!&quot; (Oh, my homeland!).

==Biography==

===Ancestry===

Manuel José Joaquín del Corazón de Jesús Belgrano was born in Buenos Aires on 3 June 1770, at his father&#x27;s house. It was located near the Santo Domingo convent, at Santo Domingo street, between the streets Martín de Tours and Santísima Trinidad (the modern names of those streets are &quot;Belgrano&quot;, &quot;Defensa&quot;, and &quot;Bolívar&quot; respectively). Though the city was still rather small, the Belgranos lived in one of its wealthiest neighborhoods. Manuel Belgrano was baptized at the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral the following day. As he was born in the Americas he was considered a criollo, a social class below the Peninsulars.

His father, Domingo (whose original Italian name was Domenico Belgrano Peri) came from the town of Imperia, Liguria, Italy. Domingo&#x27;s maternal last name was Peri, which he translated to the Spanish form Pérez; his paternal last name was Belgrano – literally &quot;Fairwheat&quot;, a name that denoted good cereal production. He changed his name &quot;Domenico&quot; to the Spanish &quot;Domingo&quot; as well. He was an Italian merchant authorized by the King of Spain to move to the Americas, and had contacts in Spain, Rio de Janeiro, and Britain. He promoted the establishment of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, which his son Manuel would lead a few years later.

Manuel Belgrano&#x27;s mother was María Josefa González Islas y Casero, born in Santiago del Estero, Argentina. The family was the second richest in Buenos Aires, after the Escaladas.

Domingo Belgrano Pérez managed a family business, and arranged for his four daughters to marry merchants who would become his trusted agents in the Banda Oriental, Misiones Province, and Spain. The eight living male sons followed different paths: Domingo José Estanislao became canon at the local cathedral, while Carlos José and José Gregorio joined the army. Manuel Belgrano was meant to follow his father&#x27;s work, but when he developed other interests, it was his brother Francisco José María de Indias who continued the family business.

===European studies===
Belgrano completed his first studies at the San Carlos school, where he learned Latin, philosophy, logic, physics, metaphysics, and literature; he graduated in 1786. Domingo had sufficient success as merchant to send his two sons Francisco and Manuel to study in Europe. He expected them to study commerce, but Manuel decided to study law. Belgrano was so successful and attained such prestige that Pope Pius VI allowed him to study forbidden literature, even books deemed as heretical, excepting only the astrological and obscene books. In this way he came into contact with authors like Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Filangieri, who were forbidden in Spain.
Belgrano studied near the intellectual elite of Spain, and by that time there were heated discussions about the ongoing French Revolution. The principles of equality and freedom, the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and criticism of the divine right of kings were constant topics of debate. Among the supporters of these ideas it was thought that Spain should be remade under similar principles, and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas.

However, the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected religion and the monarchy. Thus, despite the new influences, Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist.

Belgrano also studied living languages, political economy, and public rights. The authors that most influenced him were Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, Adam Smith, and François Quesnay. Belgrano translated Quesnay&#x27;s book &quot;Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d&#x27;un royaume agricole&quot; (&quot;General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom&quot;) to Spanish. His main interest in the works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity.

Like many South American students, he became interested in physiocracy, which stated that new wealth came from nature, that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed, and that the state should not interfere at all with it. By that time, South America had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy. Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by Adam Smith could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani, who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations, and Antonio Genovesi, who thought that the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by the state, such as the provision of free education for some.

During his time in Europe, Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of Salamanca devoted to Roman legislation, forensic practice and political economy. In 1794, he translated the &quot;Maximas del Gobierno agricultor&quot;, which had wide readership in Argentina before the revolution in 1810.

This publication, along with Belgrano&#x27;s other works, showed his preference for a combination of the ideas of the physiocrats and the neomercantilist thought by Antonio Genovesi. For him, this was the right economic model that could support Argentina&#x27;s independence.

===Work in the consulate===
He was driven by his vision of imperial partnership and drafted a well-known representacion to the Crown of 1793. A short time before his return to Buenos Aires on 3 June 1794, Belgrano was elected by Don Diego de Gardoqui as &quot;perpetual secretary&quot; of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, a new local institution which dealt with commercial and industrial issues in the name of the crown. This date would be later known in Argentina as Economist Day. He would remain in this office until 1810, and would deal with commercial disputes and promote agriculture, industry, and commerce. Not having enough freedom to make big changes in the economic system, he made big efforts to improve education. Influenced by Campomanes, he believed that the true wealth of countries was human ingenuity, and that the best way to promote industrialisation was through education.
Belgrano maintained frequent discussions with the committee members of the consulate, who were all merchants with strong interests involved in the monopolic commerce with Cadiz. He made many proposals, influenced by free trade ideas. By this time, Belgrano thought that &quot;The merchant must have freedom to buy where he can be best accommodated, and it&#x27;s natural that he does where he is supplied with the best price to be able to earn the best profit&quot;. Those proposals were rejected by the committee members; his only supporters were Juan José Castelli, Juan Larrea, and Domingo Matheu. However, Belgrano had some successes, such as creating the Nautical School, the Commerce School, and the Geometry and Drawing Academy. He created the Commerce School to influence future merchants to work towards the best interests of the nation, and the nautical and drawing ones to provide the youth with prestigious and lucrative careers. The schools were situated next to the Consulate so that Belgrano could easily supervise their development. The schools were in place for three years before they were closed by a ruling of Manuel Godoy, from the Spanish monarchy, who considered them an unnecessary luxury for a colony. It was felt that Buenos Aires might not be able to maintain them.

Belgrano tried to promote the diversification of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp, following experiences with his friend Martín de Altolaguirre. He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised as a product of the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work as expected, and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.

He helped to create the first newspaper of the city, the &quot;Telégrafo Mercantil&quot;, directed by Francisco Cabello y Mesa. He worked with Manuel José de Lavardén, and edited nearly two hundred issues. The newspaper was closed in 1802 because of conflicts with the authorities of the viceroyalty, who did not like the criticisms made in it or the jokes and parodies. He also worked at the &quot;Semanario de Agricultura, Comercio e Industria&quot;, directed by Hipólito Vieytes. He used this newspaper to explain his economic ideas: manufacturing and exporting finished goods, importing raw materials to manufacture, avoiding importing luxury goods or raw materials that could be produced or extracted locally, importing only vital products, and owning a merchant navy. The newspaper specialised in the &quot;Philosophy of History, Geography and Statistics&quot;. Many revolutionary principles were presented as essays.

Belgrano had symptoms of syphilis, which he had caught during his time in Europe. This sickness forced him to take long leaves from his work in the consulate, and to suggest his cousin Juan José Castelli, who had similar ideas, as a possible replacement during his leaves. Rejection by the committee members delayed the approval of Castelli until 1796.

===British invasions===

Belgrano was appointed as captain of the urban militias in 1797 by viceroy Pedro Melo de Portugal, who was instructed by Spain to prepare defences against a possible British or Portuguese attack. Belgrano by then worked in the consulate, and was no longer interested in pursuing a military career. Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte requested that he create a militia to counter a possible British attack, but he did not take interest in it. His first participation in a military conflict took place when the British, under William Carr Beresford, arrived with 1,600 men and captured Buenos Aires, as part of the first British invasion of the River Plate. Belgrano moved to the fortress as soon as he heard the warning, and gathered as many men as possible to join him in the fighting. However, as most of them lacked any formal training, his men marched in disorder and Belgrano ordered them to disband after a single British cannon shot scattered his panicked men. Belgrano would write later in his autobiography that he regretted not having by then even the most basic knowledge of militia work.

After the British captured the city, all Spanish authorities were requested to pledge allegiance to the British crown. Belgrano thought that the members of the consulate should leave the city and join the viceroy, but the others did not agree. They acceded to the British request; Belgrano refused to do so. He said that he wanted &quot;either our old master, or no master at all&quot;. To avoid being forced to pledge allegiance, he escaped from Buenos Aires and sought asylum at the chapel of Mercedes, in the Banda Oriental.

The British Army was defeated by a force under the direction of Santiago de Liniers, and Spanish authority was restored. It was expected that the British would return, and the whole city started to prepare for that possibility. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires after the reconquest, and put himself under the command of Liniers. He was appointed sergeant of the Patricians Regiment, under the command of Cornelio Saavedra, and started to study military strategy. After some conflicts with other officials, he resigned as sergeant and served again under the command of Liniers. A new British attack took place in July 1807. During the battle he served as field assistant to a division commanded by Balbiani.

Belgrano resumed his work in the consulate and discontinued his military studies. Due to his knowledge of French he had a brief interview with the British officer Robert Craufurd, who proposed British support for an independentist movement. Belgrano turned down the offer, suspecting that Britain might withdraw their support if their attentions were distracted by events which could occur in Europe, and in such case the revolutionaries would be helpless against a Spanish counterattack.

===Carlotism===
Manuel Belgrano was the main proponent of the Carlotist political movement in the Rio de la Plata, a response to recent developments in Europe, where Spain was at war with France. Through the abdications of Bayonne, the Spanish king Ferdinand VII was deposed and imprisoned and the Frenchman Joseph Bonaparte was appointed King of Spain by the French victors. This led to a partial power vacuum in the viceroyalty, as the legitimacy of the new king was rejected by all parties. The purpose of the Carlotist movement was to replace the authority of the deposed king with that of Carlota Joaquina, sister of Ferdinand, who was then living in Rio de Janeiro. The project was supported as a means to achieve more autonomy, and perhaps independence, for Spanish colonies in the New World. Belgrano kept a fluent mail communication with Carlota, and convinced many independentists to join him in the project, such as Castelli, Vieytes, Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, and Juan José Paso.

The project, however, found strong resistance. As Carlota was married to John VI, a prince of Portugal, many people though that Carlotism was a trick to conceal Portuguese expansionism. Carlota herself had different political ideas than those of her supporters: Belgrano and the others shared the ideas of enlightenment, but Carlota aspired to keep the full power of an absolutist monarchy. By 1810 the project was forgotten.

A new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, arrived from Europe to replace Liniers. Belgrano had failed to convince Liniers of the benefits of the Carlotist plan, so he aimed instead to convince him of refusing to give up the viceroyalty, as Liniers had been confirmed as viceroy by a Spanish king. Cisneros, appointed by the Junta of Seville, lacked such legitimacy. Liniers refused this proposal as well, and handed command to Cisneros without resistance. Belgrano later convinced the new viceroy to allow him to edit a new newspaper, the &quot;Correo de Comercio&quot;. This allowed him to gather with other revolutionary leaders with the excuse of discussing the development of the newspaper. He also supported Cisneros when he allowed foreign trade at the port (previously only Spanish ships were allowed), but this ruling was strongly rejected by Spanish merchants. The lawyer Mariano Moreno wrote &quot;The Representation of the Hacendados&quot;, an economic essay that convinced Cisneros to maintain the free foreign trade. Some historians, such as Miguel Ángel Scenna, suggest that the essay was actually Belgrano&#x27;s work, or a work by Moreno from a draft written by Belgrano. Belgrano may not have been able to present such a work himself, because he held a political office and because his past opposition to Cisneros may have risked its rejection.

Belgrano resigned from his work in the Consulate in April 1810 and moved to the countryside. A short time later he received a letter from his friends requesting him to return to Buenos Aires and join the revolutionary movements.

===May Revolution===

The Peninsular War was not developing favourably for Spain, and by May 1810 a ship arrived with the news of the defeat of Seville and the disbanding of the Junta of Seville. Without either a recognised Spanish king or the Junta that had appointed Cisneros, many people thought that the viceroy no longer had any authority. Cisneros tried to conceal the news by gathering all the newspapers brought by the ship, but Belgrano and Castelli managed to get one. Cisneros then explained the European developments to the public. Belgrano and the members of the Carlotist party, despite having given up their original idea, plotted to remove the viceroy and replace him with a junta. Under the advice of Cornelio Saavedra, they waited for the news of the defeat in Spain to take action.
Belgrano and Saavedra, representing the military and the intellectuals, got an interview with Cisneros to request an open cabildo, but without getting an answer. Cisneros called the military leaders and requested their support, but they refused, under the grounds that his viceroyalty lacked legitimacy. Castelli and other patriots insisted in their request, and Cisneros finally accepted. A massive demonstration the following day ensured that Cisneros would keep his word. The open cabildo was held on 22 May, with all political leaders present, and armed men filling the Plaza and ready to invade the cabildo in case the peninsulars attempted a disruption, which would be indicated by a signal from Belgrano. He supported the stance of his cousin Castelli, who made a speech explaining the concept of the retroversion of the sovereignty of the people, and that Spanish America was subject to the King of Spain but not to Spain itself. At the time of voting, Castelli&#x27;s proposal was coupled with the one of Cornelio Saavedra, with Belgrano among its supporters. This joint proposal for the removal of Cisneros and the creation of a government junta prevailed over the others. However, the cabildo attempted to keep Cisneros in power in spite of this result, by creating a junta with Cisneros as its president. This was rejected by the revolutionary leaders and the population. A great state of turmoil ended when the Junta was disbanded on 25 May and replaced by the Primera Junta. Belgrano was included in this junta, among many other local politicians.

In his autobiography Belgrano declared that he did not have any previous knowledge of being included in the junta, and that his appointment took him by surprise. Nevertheless, he accepted the role. He was part of the political line of Mariano Moreno; they were expecting to use the government to make big changes in the social order. One of his first rulings was the making of a Maths Academy, located in the building of the consulate and with the purpose of instructing the military. Belgrano was appointed its protector. He supported the banishment of Cisneros and the members of the Real Audience, and the execution of Liniers and other counter-revolutionaries defeated in Córdoba. Some historians suggest that he would have promoted the creation of the Operations plan, a secret document written by Moreno that set harsh ways for the junta to achieve its goals, while others consider the whole document a literary forgery done by royalists to discredit the junta. A few others suspect that some paragraphs or the whole document may have been the result of collaborative writing between Moreno, Belgrano, and Hipólito Vieytes.

===Expedition to Paraguay===
Three months after the creation of the Primera Junta, Manuel Belgrano was appointed Chief Commander of an army sent to gather support at Corrientes, Santa Fe, Paraguay, and the Banda Oriental. A few days later his goal was made more specific: he must aim for Paraguay. The Junta had been informed that the patriotic party was strong, and a small army would suffice to take control. Trusting this information, Belgrano went to Paraguay with two possible goals: get acknowledgment for the Junta in Paraguay or promote a new government that would stay on friendly terms with Buenos Aires. Belgrano was unaware that on 24 July a general assembly in Paraguay discussed the Junta of Buenos Aires, and decided to reject it and pledge allegiance to the Regency Council of Spain.

Belgrano headed north with nearly two hundred men, expecting to gather more people by the end of the Paraná River. Soldiers from the Blandengues regiments of San Nicolás and Santa Fe joined them en route, and later the Junta sent reinforcements of another two hundred soldiers. The army was welcomed by most of the population along the way, receiving donations and new recruits. Ultimately the army was composed of nearly 950 men, consisting of infantry and cavalry divided in four divisions with one piece of artillery each.

By the end of October the army stopped at Curuzú Cuatiá, where Belgrano solved an old border conflict between Corrientes and Yapeyu. He set which territories would belong to Curuzu Cuatiá and Mandisoví, and organised their urban layout around the chapel and school. By November the army arrived at the coast of Paraná near Apipé island, and there Belgrano took measures to benefit the natives that were living in missions. With his authority as speaker of the Junta he gave them full civil and political rights, granted lands, authorised commerce with the United Provinces, and lifted their restriction on taking public or religious office. However, the Junta requested later that he should seek authorization for such changes in the future.

From that point the army moved to Candelaria, which was used as a stronghold for the attack into Paraguay. The terrain gave a clear advantage to the Paraguayan governor Velazco against Belgrano: the Paraná River, nearly wide, was an effective natural barrier, and once it was crossed the patriotic army would have to move a long distance across a land without supplies. Swamps, hills, rivers, and lakes would force the army to march slowly, making a possible retreat very difficult. The Parana was crossed with several boats on 19 December, and a task force of 54 Paraguayan soldiers was forced to flee during the Battle of Campichuelo. Belgrano saw Velazco&#x27;s army from the Mbaé hill, and despite being greatly outnumbered, he ordered an attack, trusting in the moral strength of his soldiers. When the Battle of Paraguarí started, the patriots briefly held the upper hand, but eventually Velazco, with superior numbers, prevailed. Even with 10 deaths and 120 soldiers taken prisoner, Belgrano wanted to continue the fight, but his officials convinced him to retreat.

The army left for Tacuarí, being closely watched by the combined armies of Yegros and Cabañas. Those two armies had nearly three thousand soldiers, while Belgrano had barely four hundred. They were attacked from many sides during the Battle of Tacuarí, on 9 March. Greatly outnumbered and losing an unequal fight, Belgrano refused to surrender. He reorganised the remaining 235 men and ordered his secretary to burn all his documents and personal papers to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. Belgrano arranged for the troops and artillery to fire for many minutes, which made the Paraguayan soldiers disperse. When the barrage stopped, Belgrano requested an armistice, telling Cabañas that he had arrived to Paraguay to aid and not to conquer; considering the open hostility with which he was met, he would leave the province. Cabañas accepted, on the grounds that the remaining group must leave the province within a day.

The campaign to Paraguay was a complete military defeat for Belgrano. However, the aftermath of the conflict led the Paraguayans to replace Velazco with a local junta, and declare independence from Spain. Under the rule of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, Paraguay broke ties with Buenos Aires as well, and stayed isolated for several years afterwards.

===Creation of the flag of Argentina===
After the defeat in Tacuarí, the government of Buenos Aires (which by then was the First Triumvirate) issued a series of conflicting orders. First they requested he should fight the royalists in the Banda Oriental, then to return to the city and be judged for the defeats. However, no charges were formulated against him.

He was appointed as the head of the Regiment of Patricians, replacing the banished Cornelio Saavedra, but the troops did not accept him and started the Braids Mutiny. After that, the Triumvirate requested that he fortify Rosario against possible royalist attacks from the Banda Oriental. Belgrano created two batteries, &quot;Independencia&quot; (&quot;Independence&quot;) and &quot;Libertad&quot; (&quot;Freedom&quot;). After realising that both patriots and royalists were fighting under the same colours, he created the cockade of Argentina, of light blue and white, the use of which was approved by the Triumvirate. The reasons for the colours are usually considered to be either loyalty to the House of Bourbon or his esteem of the Virgin Mary. Belgrano created a flag with the same colours, which was hoisted at Rosario near the Paraná River on 27 February 1812. On that same day he was appointed to replace Pueyrredon in the Army of the North, so he travelled to Yatasto.

He found demoralised officials, nearly 1,500 soldiers (a quarter of them hospitalised), minimal artillery, and no money. Some of the officials were Manuel Dorrego, Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid, Cornelio Zelaya, José María Paz, Diego Balcarce, and Eustaquio Díaz Vélez. The cities were much more hostile to the Army than those that Belgrano encountered on his way into Paraguay. Salta was menaced by the royalist general José Manuel de Goyeneche; Belgrano had orders to take command and retreat without fighting, but he disobeyed. He prepared a base at Campo Santo, in Salta, where he improved the hospital and created a military tribunal. He later moved to Jujuy, knowing that he did not have the resources to launch an attack on Upper Peru.
The First Triumvirate did not approve the use of the flag created in Rosario, but Belgrano was initially unaware of that. He had the flag blessed by the priest Juan Ignacio de Gorriti at Salta, on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. When he found out the flag was not approved, he put it away. When asked, he would say that he was keeping it for a great victory.

Three months later royalist general Pío Tristán advanced in the north with more than three thousand men, prepared to invade the United Provinces. Once again outnumbered by larger armies, Belgrano organised a great exodus of the city of Jujuy: the entire population of the city would have to retreat with the army and not leave behind anything that might be of value to the royalists (such as animals, crops, or housing). By September a proper formation of columns provided them with a victory against a royalist task force of 500 men during the Battle of Las Piedras. The First Triumvirate commanded Belgrano to retreat to Cordoba without fighting, but he thought that doing so would mean the loss of the northern provinces. Thus, instead of continuing to Cordoba, he was convinced by the people of San Miguel de Tucumán to make a stand there. His forces had increased by then to nearly 1,800 soldiers, still much less than the 3,000 at Tristan&#x27;s command. Even so, he obtained a victory in the Battle of Tucumán.

By that time, the First Triumvirate was replaced by the Second Triumvirate, which provided greater support for Belgrano. The Second Triumvirate called the Assembly of Year XIII soon after taking power, which was intended to declare independence and enact a national constitution but failed to do so because of political disputes between the members. It did not take measures regarding the national flag but allowed Belgrano to use the blue and white flag as the flag of the Army of the North.
By September, he provided assistance to the troops commanded by José Miguel Díaz Vélez. This infantry was fighting a 600-strong royalist cavalry. Through Belgrano&#x27;s reinforcements, they eventually won the battle and captured the city of Tucumán. After the defeat in Tucumán, Tristán garrisoned at the city of Salta with 2,500 men. Belgrano, with reinforcements from the government, intended to gather 4,000 men and march to Upper Peru, up to the border of the Viceroyalty of Lima. The Battle of Salta, the first battle with the new approved banner, was a decisive victory, ending with the capitulation of Pío Tristán and all of his army.

These victories ensured Argentine authority in the northwest and stopped the royalist advance into the central territory. Although there were a number of colonialist &#x27;invasions&#x27; from Upper Peru until 1821, Belgrano&#x27;s campaign is widely considered the decisive one.

===Campaign to Upper Peru===
By June 1813 Belgrano set up a base in Potosí with an army of 2,500 men, to prepare an attack on Upper Peru. Goyeneche moved to Oruro and resigned, being replaced by Joaquín de la Pezuela. Belgrano administrated the zone and tried to revert the bad impression left by the previous campaign of Juan José Castelli. Belgrano initiated good relations with the natives as well. Belgrano&#x27;s plan was to attack the royalists from the front and the sides, with the aid of the armies of Cárdenas and Zelaya. Both armies were near 3,500 men. However, the royalists obtained an important advantage by defeating Cárdenas and getting possession of his papers, which gave them insight into the patriotic plans.

Belgrano was taken by surprise at Vilcapugio on 1 October, and initially gained the upper hand against the royalist troops, who started to flee. However, when Pezuela saw that the patriotic armies were not following, he reorganised his forces, returned to the battle, and won. There were barely 400 survivors. Belgrano said: &quot;Soldiers: we have lost the battle after so much fighting. Victory has betrayed us by going to the enemy ranks during our triumph. It does not matter! The flag of the nation still swings in our hands!&quot;. After gathering his army at Macha, where he received reinforcements from Cochabamba, Belgrano was ready for another engagement with Pezuela, whose troops were not in a better situation. On 14 November, Belgrano was again vanquished by the royalists at Ayohuma, and was forced to withdraw the remains of his army towards Potosí and from there to Jujuy.
The Second Triumvirate reacted by sending José de San Martín to take the command of the Army of the North, with Belgrano as his second in command. San Martín would reinforce the battle-weary Army of the North with his own soldiers. Hastened by Belgrano&#x27;s illness, San Martín travelled to the rendezvous as quickly as possible; they met at the Yatasto relay, in Salta. Belgrano gave San Martin full freedom to implement changes and took command of the First Regiment. The Second Triumvirate, and later the Supreme Director Gervasio Posadas, requested Belgrano to return to Buenos Aires and be judged for the defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, but San Martín refused to send him because of his poor health. San Martín finally agreed to send Belgrano to Córdoba by March 1814. He temporarily settled in Luján to await outcome of the trial, and during this time he wrote his autobiography. Soon afterwards, all charges against Belgrano were dismissed, as no definite accusation was formulated against him. The new government, trusting in Belgrano&#x27;s diplomatic abilities, sent him on a mission to Europe to negotiate support for the independence of the United Provinces.

===Declaration of Independence===
By 1814 the Spanish King Ferdinand VII had returned to the throne and started the Absolutist Restoration, which had grave consequences for the governments in the Americas. Belgrano and Bernardino Rivadavia were sent to Europe to seek support for the United Provinces from both Spain and Britain. They sought to promote the crowning of Francisco de Paula, son of Charles IV of Spain, as regent of the United Provinces, but in the end he refused to act against the interests of the King of Spain. The diplomatic mission failed, but Belgrano learned of changes in ideology that had taken place in Europe since his previous visit. With the influence of the French Revolution, there had been a great consensus for making republican governments. After the government of Napoleon I, monarchies were preferred again, but in the form of constitutional monarchies, such as in Britain. He also noticed that the European powers approved of the South American revolutions, but the approval was compromised when the countries started to fall into anarchy.

When the emissaries returned to Buenos Aires, the government was worried by the defeats of Rondeau at Sipe Sipe and the political stir generated by José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López. Alvarez Thomas appointed Belgrano to head the army at Rosario, but shortly afterwards Thomas resigned. Pueyrredón became the new Supreme Director. With the signing of the Santo Tomé pact, the aforementioned army was retired from Rosario. Belgrano was then sent back to take command of the Army of the North, with the strong support of San Martín. &quot;In the case of designating who must replace Rondeau, I am decided for Belgrano; he is the most methodical man of all whom I know in America; he is full of integrity and natural talent. He may not have the military knowledge of a Moreau or a Bonaparte as far as the army is concerned, but I think he is the best we have in South America&quot;.

Belgrano met with the Congress of Tucuman on 6 July 1816 to explain the results of his diplomatic mission in Europe. He thought that enacting a local monarchy would help to prevent anarchy, which would not end simply with independence from Spain. He felt a declaration of independence would be more easily accepted by the European powers if it created a monarchic system. To this end he formulated the Inca Plan: a monarchy ruled by a noble of the Inca civilisation. He thought that this would generate support from the indigenous populations as well, and repair the actions taken against the Inca by the Spanish colonisation. This proposal was supported by San Martín, Güemes, the deputies from the Upper Peru, and other provinces, but it found a strong rejection from Buenos Aires; they would not accept Cuzco as the capital city. On 9 July the Congress finally signed the Declaration of Independence from Spain. The flag created by Belgrano, which was being used without a law regulating it, was accepted as the national flag. The Inca Plan was still under discussion, but the Congress delayed it due to several states of emergency in the provinces caused by the war.

In August Belgrano again took command of the Army of the North, but with very limited people and resources. He was ordered to avoid trying to advance against the royalists in the north and was to stay in a defensive state at Tucumán. With Güemes in Salta, his task was to prevent the Royalists from moving to the south. The Supreme Director Pueyrredón was supporting an alternative plan designed by José de San Martín: create the Army of the Andes at Cuyo and, after making the Crossing of the Andes, defeat the royalists in Chile, get control of the Chilean navy, and attack the royalist stronghold of Lima with it.

===Last years===
In 1819 Buenos Aires was at war with José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López and requested San Martín and Belgrano to return with their armies to take part in the conflict. San Martín refused to do so, but Belgrano accepted. However, before his arrival the governors Estanislao López and Juan José Viamonte signed an eight-day truce to start peace negotiations. Belgrano&#x27;s health was in a very bad state by this point, but he refused to resign, thinking that the morale of the Army would suffer without his presence. He moved to the frontier between Santa Fe and Córdoba, from where he would be able to move to either the litoral or the north if needed. His health continued to worsen, and he was given an unlimited leave from work by the Supreme Director. He handed command to Fernández de la Cruz and moved to Tucumán, where he met his daughter Manuela Mónica, just one year old. The governor of Tucuman, Feliciano de la Motta, was deposed during his stay, and Belgrano was taken prisoner. Abraham González led the uprising and attempted to put Belgrano into a shrew&#x27;s fiddle, but Belgrano&#x27;s doctor Josef Redhead objected, because of his delicate health, and his sentence was changed to simple imprisonment. When Bernabé Araoz took control of the government of Tucumán, Belgrano was immediately released.

He returned to Buenos Aires, to his parents&#x27; house. By that time the Battle of Cepeda had ended the authority of the Supreme Directors, starting the period known as &quot;Anarchy of the year 20&quot;. On 20 June 1820, at the age of 50, Belgrano died of dropsy. Due to his poverty, as the war consumed all his old wealth, he paid his doctor with his clock and his carriage, some of the few possessions he still had. As requested, he was shrouded into the robes of the Dominican Order and buried in the Santo Domingo convent. Before dying, Belgrano said &quot;Ay, Patria mía&quot; (in Spanish, &quot;Oh, my Fatherland&quot;).

Due to the state of anarchy being experienced by the city, Belgrano&#x27;s death was largely unnoticed. The only newspaper of the time to note his death was &quot;El Despertador Teofilantrópico&quot;, written by Francisco de Paula Castañeda, and there was no government representation at his funeral. Former students of his educative institutions would arrive in the following days with obsequies, when the news started to be known. The following year the political context was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia, who was minister by then, organised a massive state funeral.

In 1902, during the presidency of Julio Argentino Roca, Belgrano&#x27;s body was exhumed from the atrium of Santo Domingo, to be moved into a mausoleum. This was done on 4 September, by a government commission which included Dr. Joaquín V. González (ministry of interior), Pablo Riccheri (ministry of war), Gabriel L. Souto (president of the commission), Fray Modesto Becco (from the convent), Carlos Vega Belgrano and coronel Manuel Belgrano (descendants of Belgrano), Dr. Armando Claros (subsecretary of the Interior), Dr. Marcial Quiroga (Health Inspector of the Army), Dr. Carlos Malbrán (president of the National Department of Health), Coronel Justo Domínguez, and doctors Luis Peluffo and C. Massot (Arsenal of War). The exhumation revealed a number of preserved bones, pieces of wood, and nails. The bones were placed on a silver plate, and the following day there was a great controversy in the press: the newspaper &quot;La Prensa&quot; announced that Joaquín V. González and Riccheri had stolen a pair of teeth. Both were returned the following day. Gonzalez declared that he intended to show the tooth to his friends, and Riccheri that he took one to Belgrano&#x27;s biographer, Bartolomé Mitre.

==Personal life==

Manuel Belgrano met María Josefa Ezcurra, sister of Encarnación Ezcurra, at the age of 22. Her father, Juan Ignacio Ezcurra, did not approve of their relationship because of the bankruptcy of Domingo Belgrano, Manuel&#x27;s father. Juan Ignacio arranged the wedding of his daughter with Juan Esteban Ezcurra, a distant relative from Pamplona that worked selling clothes. Juan Ignacio opposed the May Revolution and returned to Spain, leaving his wife in Buenos Aires, which allowed her to return to her former relationship with Belgrano.

When Belgrano was dispatched to Upper Peru, María Josefa followed him to Jujuy. She took part in the Jujuy Exodus and saw the battle of Tucumán. It is thought that she was pregnant by this time. Her son, Pedro Pablo, was born on 30 July 1813. Pedro Pablo was adopted by Encarnación Ezcurra and her husband, Juan Manuel de Rosas, who she had married shortly before.

Belgrano also met María Dolores Helguero in Tucumán, and briefly considered getting married, but the war forced a postponement. María Dolores married another man; the relationship ended but was briefly restarted in 1818. While he was near the frontiers of Córdoba, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires, and in a delicate state of health, he learned that María Dolores had given birth to his daughter, Manuela Mónica del Sagrado Corazón, who was born on 4 May 1819.

Neither of these children were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where he said he had no children. However, it is thought that he did not mention them in order to protect their mothers, as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.

Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, Belgrano was a freemason. Despite this, he was a devout Catholic and a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic.

===Diseases===
There are no records of diseases experienced by Belgrano during his youth or adolescence. His first illness dates from the time of his return to Buenos Aires, when he worked in the consulate; he experienced symptoms of syphilis caught during his stay in Spain. He was treated by the most prestigious physicians of the city: Miguel O&#x27;Gorman, related to Camila O&#x27;Gorman, from the Protomedicato of Buenos Aires, Miguel García de Rojas, and José Ignacio de Arocha. This disease forced him to take long leaves from his work at the consulate and take repose stays at Maldonado and San Isidro. He was treated with salts and iodines, and his condition eventually improved. It is also suspected that he may have had rheumatism. By the year 1800 he had a growing lacrimal fistula in one of his eyes and was invited by the King to move to Spain for a cure. He was offered a one-year leave with paid wages, but he rejected it, giving priority to his work for the nation over his own personal health. The fistula would later stabilise at a safe and unnoticeable size.
During his military career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; he was almost too ill to participate in the battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, and not in the respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in the autopsy.

Belgrano also experienced paludism (malaria) during the second campaign to Upper Peru. On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease, which made it difficult for him to work or even talk. He was treated by doctor Joseph Readhead, who employed a local species of the &quot;Cinchona&quot; medicinal plant. The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because of the treatment and by having left the endemic zone.

He also experienced stomach disease, having a low production of gastric acids. This was worsened by harsh military conditions, including long periods with little food. The first references to the disease that would lead to his death, a case of edema, are from a year before, in a letter directed to Álvarez Thomas. He declared having problems in the chest, a lung, and his right leg. A later letter to Sarratea confirmed his situation and specified that it started on 23 April 1819. The gravity of his condition led the doctor Francisco de Paula Rivero to diagnose an advanced dropsy. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires, where he died. He was embalmed by Joseph Redhead and Juan Sullivan. Sullivan performed the autopsy; it revealed high levels of fluid in multiple edemas and a tumor in the right epigastrium. The liver and spleen had grown beyond normal levels, there were hamartomas in the kidneys, and problems with the lungs and heart.

===Political thought===
Manuel Belgrano had a vast intellectual awareness of most important topics of his age. He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions, and was a versatile polyglot, capable of understanding Spanish, English, French, Italian, and some indigenous languages. This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment, and understand the social, economic, technical, educative, political, cultural, and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas. He helped to promote those ideas using the press and with his work in the consulate. He rejected localist perspectives, favouring a Latin Americanist one. He was driven by the concept of the common good, which he regarded as an ethical value. He considered public health, education, and work as part of the common good, as well as religion. He did not share completely the ideas of the French Revolution, but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment: most notably, he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs, being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology. His monarchism was not a conservative one, as he agreed that the existing state of things should be modified, but not towards a republic as in France or the United States, but towards a constitutional monarchy, like in Britain.

In the economic fields, he was influenced by the principles of physiocracy, an economic doctrine that considered that nature was the source of wealth. As a result, much of his works and reform proposals at the consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and free trade. He maintained a fluent contact with the consulates of other cities, developing a view of the viceroyalty as a whole. This led to an increased work in cartography of the largely unpopulated areas of the territory; the maps designed during this period would later prove a great help for José de San Martín during the Crossing of the Andes. He introduced new crops and promoted the use of local fauna for livestock production. He protected the weaving industry by increasing the production of cotton in Cochabamba, as he considered the local crop to be of similar quality to the cotton from Europe.

===Promotion of education===
Manuel Belgrano was one of the first politicians to advocate the development of an important educative system. He did so at the first report he made as head of the Consulate of Commerce, suggesting the creating of schools of agriculture and commerce. A school of agriculture would teach about important topics such as crop rotation, the specific ways to work with each crop, methods of seeding and harvesting, preservation of seeds, and identification of pests. Until that time, the only previous attempts to teach agriculture was done by the Jesuits, who were banished in 1767.

He was not only concerned with higher education, but also with primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children. In those schools, students would learn to read and learn basic maths and the catechism. He thought that this would help to raise people willing to work and reduce laziness.

He also promoted the creation of schools for women, where they would learn about weaving, as well as reading. However, he did not aim to generate intellectual women, but just to prevent ignorance and laziness, and have them learn things valuable for daily living. Being a strong Catholic himself, he was aligned with the Catholic perspective that rejected mixed-sex education, in contrast with Protestantism.

His concern with public education was not interrupted by his military campaigns. In 1813 he was rewarded with 40,000 pesos for his victories at Salta and Tucumán, an amount that would equal almost 80 gold kilograms. Belgrano rejected taking the prize money for himself, considering that a patriot should not seek money or wealth. He gave it back to the XIII year Assembly, with instructions to build primary schools at Tarija, Jujuy, San Miguel de Tucumán, and Santiago del Estero. He laid out a series of instructions about the methods and requirements for the selection of the teachers. However, the schools were not built, and by 1823 Bernardino Rivadavia declared that the money was lost; Juan Ramón Balcarce included it in the debt of the Buenos Aires province a decade later.

===Translations===
The historian Bartolomé Mitre stated that Manuel Belgrano held a deep admiration for George Washington, leader of the American Revolution and first President of the United States. Because of this, he worked on a translation of George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address into the Spanish language. He started working on it during the Paraguay Campaign, but before the battle of Tacuarí he destroyed all his papers, including the unfinished translation, to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. Belgrano resumed work on it afterwards and finished it before the Battle of Salta. He sent it to Buenos Aires for publication. George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address is considered, along with Gettysburg Address, one of the most important texts in the history of the United States. It talks about the importance of keeping national unity as the key to maintain independence, prosperity, and freedom—ideas that were shared by Belgrano regarding the population of Hispanic America.

==Legacy==

Belgrano is considered one of the greatest heroes in Argentina&#x27;s history. His face has regularly graced bank notes, postage stamps and memorabilia, his name gracing important city landmarks across the country (see below). National Flag Day is celebrated every year on 20 June. in honor of his death.

In 1873 a bronze equestrian statue of Belgrano by the French sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse was erected through public subscription at the Plaza de Mayo (in front of the future Casa Rosada) in Buenos AIres, and in 1903 an expensive mausoleum that received his ashes by the Italian sculptor Ettore Ximenes at the atrium of the nearby Santo Domingo Convent, featuring larger than life angels supporting an elaborate casket flanked by the two allegorical figures of &quot;Thought&quot; and &quot;Action&quot; and reliefs depicting the battles of Tucuman and Salta (in 2023 the mausoleum underwent a thorough restoration). 
In 1910 a large monument was erected at the site of the Battle of Salta, the work of the Catalan sculptor Torquat Tasso, topped by a bronze allegory of Liberty and life-size statues of Belgrano holding the flag and his officers Dorrego, Díaz Vélez and Zelaya. The monument is flanked by bronze condors and reliefs by noted Argentinian artist Lola Mora.

A large monument complex (&quot;Monumento Nacional a la Bandera&quot;, National Flag Memorial) was built in 1957 in honour of the flag in Rosario, showcasing monumental architecture, statuary and reliefs by prominent Argentinian artists of the era architect Alejandro Bustillo and sculptors José Fioravanti, Alfredo Bigatti and Eduardo Barnes, including a large bronze statue of Belgrano. The Flag Memorial and the park that surround it are the seat of national celebrations every Flag Day.

Jujuy Province is declared the honorary capital of Argentina each 23 August since 2002, in reference to the Jujuy Exodus. 

The cruiser ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, which was sunk during the Falklands War, was named after him,
as was the earlier 1896 ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, and Puerto Belgrano, which is the largest base of the Argentinian navy. A small town in the province of Córdoba, Argentina, Villa General Belgrano, also bears his name, as well as many other small towns and departments. Central &quot;Avenida Belgrano&quot; in the City of Buenos Aires and part of the avenue that leads to the Flag Memorial in Rosario (also &quot;Avenida Belgrano&quot;) bear his name. Additionally, there is an important northern neighbourhood within Buenos Aires city that carries the name Belgrano.

In the museum &quot;Casa de la Libertad&quot; at Sucre, Bolivia, there is an Argentine flag, protected by a glass case and in a deteriorated condition, which they claim to be the original one raised by Belgrano for first time in 1812. The ensign was one of two abandoned and hidden inside a small church near Macha after the battle of Ayohuma, during the retreat from Upper Peru in 1813. The other flag was given back to Argentina by the Bolivian authorities in 1896.

In Genoa, Italy, there is a commemorative statue of Belgrano, at the end of the &quot;Corso Buenos Aires&quot;.

===Historiography===
The first biography of Manuel Belgrano was his autobiography, which he wrote by the time he was stationed in Lujan. It long remained unpublished. His first biography written by someone else was &quot;Bosquejo histórico del General Don Manuel Belgrano&quot; (&quot;Historical stub on General Don Manuel Belgrano&quot;), authored by José Ignacio Álvarez Thomas. Álvarez Thomas wrote it during his exile at Colonia del Sacramento, and his work had a high political bias.

The historian Bartolomé Mitre wrote &quot;Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina&quot; (), whose scope expanded on the simple biography of Belgrano himself and detailed instead the Argentine War of Independence as a whole. The work followed the Great Man theory, linking the success in the war of independence to the figure of Belgrano and his natal Buenos Aires. This book included the autobiography of Belgrano as well, which was discovered by Mitre. The book was criticised by contemporary Argentine authors, such as Dalmacio Vélez Sarsfield and Juan Bautista Alberdi, born in other provinces, and Vicente Fidel López. Vélez Sarsfield dismissed the Great Man theory and maintained that the work of the other provinces for the Argentine independence was as important as that of Buenos Aires. He criticised the work of Mitre at &quot;&quot;Rectificaciones históricas: General Belgrano, General Güemes&quot; (&quot;Historical rectifications: General Belgrano, General Güemes&quot;) which dealt with Martín Miguel de Güemes as well, and Mitre would answer at &quot;Estudios históricos sobre la Revolución de Mayo: Belgrano y Güemes&quot; (&quot;Historical studies about the May Revolution: Belgrano and Güemes&quot;). Both books were written in 1864. Vicente López provided a biography of Belgrano from a different angle, his book was &quot;Debate histórico, refutaciones a las comprobaciones históricas sobre la Historia de Belgrano&quot; (&quot;Historical debate, rebuttals to the historical checkings about the history of Belgrano&quot;), and Mitre replied with &quot;Nuevas comprobaciones sobre historia argentina&quot;&quot; (&quot;New checkings about the history of Argentina&quot;). López considered history as an art form, and Mitre considered it a science, rejecting historical narrations that could not be backed by primary sources. These disputes about Belgrano are considered the starting point of the Historiography of Argentina. Historiographical studies of Manuel Belgrano are currently held by the Belgranian National Institute.

===Numismatics===
Belgrano appears on a number of currencies in the numismatic history of Argentina. He appeared for the first time on the banknotes of 1, 5, and 10 pesos according to the Peso Ley 18.188, in effect from 1970 to 1983. He was later included on the 10,000 pesos banknotes of the pesos argentinos, the highest banknote value in circulation. The Argentine austral had a number of political and military figures that did not include Belgrano, but later the 10,000 &quot;pesos argentinos&quot; banknotes were allowed to be used as &quot;australes&quot;. The current Argentine peso displays Belgrano on 10-peso banknote. The 1997 and 2002 series only modified small details.

<text>Wing Commander is a media franchise consisting of space combat simulation video games from Origin Systems, Inc., an animated television series, a feature film, a collectible card game, a series of novels, and action figures. The franchise originated in 1990 with the release of the video game &quot;Wing Commander&quot;.

==Setting and gameplay==

Set in the 27th century, the games tell the story of humanity&#x27;s war against the Kilrathi, an alien species of large feline bipeds. The Kilrathi are native to the planet Kilrah with their society depicted as an empire. Physically they are bipeds who strongly resemble big cats: they have leonine manes, but also have markings which distinguish their clan of origin. The species is featured in every game, with later games revealing more complex characters than just a mindless enemy. Later games would move on from the Kilrathi war setting, with &quot;Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom&quot; being about a conspiracy within the ranks and &quot;Wing Commander: Prophecy&quot; and &quot;Secret Ops&quot; telling the battles against a new enemy known as the Nephilim.

The player represents the Terran Confederation, the primary human government in the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series. The Terran Confederation is an alliance of systems and regional governments which provide unified protection and economic growth. Launching from carrier ships, the player fulfills various missions in space fighter aircraft. The games were all notable for their storytelling through extensive cutscenes. Starting with &quot;Wing Commander III&quot;, every game (excluding &quot;Secret Ops&quot;) contained cutscenes that incorporated live action filming, starring several major Hollywood actors, including John Rhys-Davies, Mark Hamill, Thomas F. Wilson and Malcolm McDowell, as well as Christopher Walken, John Hurt, and Clive Owen in &quot;Privateer 2: The Darkening&quot;.

==Games==

The &quot;Wing Commander&quot; game series began in 1990 with &quot;Wing Commander&quot;. The newest addition to the series, &quot;Wing Commander Arena&quot;, was released for the Xbox Live Arcade service on July 25, 2007.

===&quot;Wing Commander&quot;===

The player begins his tour of duty as a young space fighter pilot on the carrier the TCS &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Claw&quot;. The player can set this character&#x27;s name and callsign in the first games in the franchise. As of &quot;Wing Commander 3&quot;, the protagonist is given the canonical name Christopher &quot;Maverick&quot; Blair. Through the player&#x27;s heroic efforts, the Confederation is able to destroy the Kilrathi&#x27;s sector headquarters and drive them from the Vega sector. Through the course of the Vega campaign, the player can gain numerous promotions and medals and fly in various squadrons, each featuring a different fighter. The game was notable for its innovative and seldom-repeated &quot;campaign tree&quot; structure, whereby the &quot;path&quot; the player took on the way to the end would be determined by the player&#x27;s performance on preceding missions. In-game cinematics in &quot;newsreel&quot; format reflected the success or failure of the player and the &quot;Claw&quot;.

Originally announced as &quot;Squadron&quot;, the name was changed to &quot;Wingleader&quot; shortly into development; however, trademark issues forced a name change to &quot;Wing Commander&quot; at the last moment. The development team&#x27;s nickname for the otherwise-unnamed protagonist was &quot;Bluehair&quot;, due to his unusual shade of hair. Perhaps in a nod to this in-joke, when the character was given an actual name in later installments, Origin chose &quot;Blair&quot;, a shortened version of the old nickname. &quot;Wing Commander&quot; was ported to the Amiga, FM Towns, SNES, Mega-CD, Amiga CD32, 3DO, Mac OS, and PlayStation Portable systems, the most ports of any &quot;Wing Commander&quot; game. In the Sega CD port which added voice acting, the player character was given the callsign of &quot;HotShot&quot; to allow him to be addressed by voice.

In 1991, &quot;Wing Commander&quot; won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1990.

====&quot;The Secret Missions&quot;====
A new Kilrathi secret weapon destroys the Terran colony of Goddard. In retribution, the Confederation plans a daring raid, Operation Thor&#x27;s Hammer. &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Claw&quot; must follow the Kilrathi deep into their own territory and destroy their new super weapon, the dreadnaught &quot;Sivar&quot;.

&quot;The Secret Missions&quot; was ported to the FM Towns, SNES, Sony PSP (as part of the EA Replay bundle), and was included with &quot;Wing Commander&quot; on the 3DO and Macintosh as part of &quot;Super Wing Commander&quot;.

====&quot;The Secret Missions 2: Crusade&quot;====
When the Confederation is just celebrating a new alliance with the bird-like native species of the planet Firekka, they learn that entire fleets of Kilrathi ships are leaving from other sectors and heading towards the Firekka system. Concerned, but massively outnumbered, the Confederation ships must retreat, but they soon learn from a Kilrathi defector that Firekka has been chosen as the place for a holy Kilrathi ceremony. The Confederation soon develops a plan to disrupt that ceremony in an act of terrorism meant to deliver a blow to enemy morale, and it is up to the pilots of &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Claw&quot; to ensure the success of the mission.

&quot;The Secret Missions 2: Crusade&quot; was ported to the FM Towns.

====&quot;Super Wing Commander&quot;====
In 1994, a revamped version of the original &quot;Wing Commander&quot;, entitled &quot;Super Wing Commander&quot; (SWC), was released for the 3DO. It featured new graphics, full speech and included a &quot;Secret Missions 1.5&quot; campaign (between the original campaigns 1 and 2) with a follow-up to Thor&#x27;s Hammer in which the &quot;Claw&quot; destroys the Kilrathi shipyards that constructed the &quot;Sivar&quot;.

&quot;Super Wing Commander&quot; was ported to the Macintosh in 1995.

===&quot;Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi&quot;===

Shortly after the Firekka campaign, the &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Claw&quot; attempts to attack the Kilrathi headquarters in the Enigma sector, but is ambushed by new Kilrathi &quot;Strakha&quot; stealth fighters and is lost. No one but Blair sees these fighters, so they are dismissed as an excuse to cover his cowardice. He is scapegoated for the loss of the &quot;Claw&quot;, is demoted to captain and transferred to a backwater space station. Ten years later, he is called back into action when he is able to save the Confederation&#x27;s flagship, the TCS &quot;Concordia&quot;. Meeting many old friends there, he continues the fight against the Kilrathi, finally culminating in the destruction of their sector HQ, thus clearing his name and uncovering a traitor on the Concordia&#x27;s flight decks, who was the mastermind behind the ambush and destruction of the &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Claw&quot;.

&quot;Wing Commander II&quot; was ported to the FM Towns. In 1992, it won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1991&quot;.

====&quot;Special Operations 1&quot;====
Blair is transferred to the undercover Special Operations division, supporting Kilrathi colonies that are defecting from the Empire. But first he must solve the problem of a mutiny on a Confed cruiser.

====&quot;Special Operations 2&quot;====
Jazz, the traitor from &quot;Wing Commander II&quot;, has fled imprisonment and the Mandarin (the society of traitors) are also able to steal some of the Confederation&#x27;s newest top-secret fighters. Blair must hunt them down and face Jazz in one final showdown.

===&quot;Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger&quot;===

The war is going very badly for the Confederation, far worse than what the public (or the player) generally knows. Battles are lost on all fronts, casualties are mounting, and the Concordia is destroyed. Colonel Christopher Blair (the player from the first games, now with a set name), is transferred to the TCS &quot;Victory&quot;, an old ship from the first days of the war. In a last-ditch attempt to win the war, Confed has designed the TCS &quot;Behemoth&quot;, a doomsday weapon able to destroy an entire planet. It is Blair&#x27;s mission to help end this war for good, by destroying the Kilrathi homeworld of Kilrah. Unfortunately the Behemoth is destroyed by Kilrathi forces. The enemy fighters seemed to know exactly about the weakpoints of the weapon. Later on Blair finds out that his old friend Hobbes, a Kilrathi defector, is a sleeper agent and the traitor responsible for the Confed&#x27;s losses. The last hope of winning the war for the Confederation is a secret weapon, the &quot;Temblor Bomb&quot;, using the tectonic instability of Kilrah to destroy the planet. Blair is finally able to attack Kilrah, firing the bomb and destroying the Kilrathi homeworld. With the royal family of Kilrah killed and their homeworld lost, Melek, once attaché to the Kilrathi prince, surrenders before Blair.

&quot;Wing Commander III&quot; was the first game in the series to use full motion video as opposed to animated cutscenes, and texture-mapped 3D instead of sprite-based graphics. The game features well-known actors such as Mark Hamill as Christopher Blair, John Rhys-Davies as James &quot;Paladin&quot; Taggart, Thomas F. Wilson as Todd &quot;Maniac&quot; Marshall, Malcolm McDowell as Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn, Josh Lucas as &quot;Flash&quot;, and Ginger Lynn as Chief Technician Rachel Coriolis.

&quot;Wing Commander III&quot; was ported to the PlayStation, Macintosh and the 3DO.

===&quot;Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom&quot;===

The war with the Kilrathi is over, but not all is well within the Confederation. Skirmishes in the Border Worlds destroy ships regularly. Both Confed and the Union of Border Worlds assign blame to each other and the skirmishes threaten to lead to all-out war. Blair is soon recalled to active duty and sent to the Border Worlds to confirm Confed&#x27;s determination. But he finds out that a conspiracy of war-mongers with members in the highest Confed circles are responsible for the attacks. Defecting to the Border Worlds, Blair must expose the conspiracy to help restore the peace in a galaxy still torn over the events of the Kilrathi-Terran War.

&quot;The Price of Freedom&quot; retained the storytelling-style of its predecessor, using live-action cutscenes with an ensemble cast of actors. Many of the actors from &quot;Wing Commander III&quot; returned to reprise their roles. The story&#x27;s final sequence was innovative in that dialogue choices made by the player affected the outcome of the hearing. However, only three endings were possible, and two of the outcomes depended on the earlier choices made by the player.

&quot;Wing Commander IV&quot; was ported to the PlayStation and Mac OS. To owners of the original MS-DOS version, Origin made available a Windows 95 DirectX port, free of charge.

===&quot;Wing Commander: Prophecy&quot;===

Peace has finally come to the Confederation, or so it seems. Still remaining vigilant, they commission the new megacarrier TCS &quot;Midway&quot;, which is soon needed when Kilrathi worlds are attacked by an enemy whose coming was foretold in ancient Kilrathi prophecies. The insectoid enemy, codenamed the Nephilim, soon begin attacking Confed space and the Midway is called in to stop their advance. As young hotshot pilot Lance Casey, the player must fight their organic ships to help destroy the wormhole they used to enter Kilrathi space, thereby halting the invasion, at least for a while.

As did &quot;Wing Commander IV&quot;, &quot;Prophecy&quot; incorporated live-action cutscenes with actors. &quot;Prophecy&quot; was ported to the Game Boy Advance.

====&quot;Wing Commander: Secret Ops&quot;====
The Nephilim return, this time much closer to Earth. Transferred to the cruiser TCS &quot;Cerberus&quot;, Casey and his wingmates must repel the invasion once again.

&quot;Secret Ops&quot; was an experiment in game distribution. It was at first only available as a free download. In regular intervals, new episodes were released, each featuring several new missions with the storyline told through in-game cutscenes. The game was later available in a collection together with &quot;Prophecy&quot;, and sold as &quot;Prophecy Gold&quot;.

===Spin-offs===
====&quot;Wing Commander Academy&quot;====

A game where the player could build their own missions using ships from &quot;Wing Commander II&quot;.

====&quot;Wing Commander: Privateer&quot;====

Set in the border regions of Confederation space, the player takes control of a privateer (in &quot;Wing Commander&quot;, a &quot;privateer&quot; is a mercenary spacer) who may profit by trading, performing various missions, or pirating. Meanwhile, an ancient alien spaceship has been awakened and is on the loose, attacking ships at random, and the player-controlled privateer may be the Confederation&#x27;s only hope in defeating it.

This game featured completely open-ended gameplay, with the player able to completely ignore the main storyline if they so desired.

=====&quot;Righteous Fire&quot;=====
When the player&#x27;s priceless Steltek Gun is stolen, he embarks on a quest that will bring him into conflict with the Luddite-like Church of Man and their shady leader, Mordecai Jones.

====&quot;Wing Commander Armada&quot;====

&quot;Armada&quot; featured both an action and a strategy game mode and several multiplayer options. The game was ported to the NEC PC9821 and FM Towns.

=====&quot;Proving Grounds&quot;=====
This add-on for &quot;Armada&quot; added numerous new features such as a new &quot;arcade&quot;-mode with powerups, radar-obscuring asteroids, and several new multiplayer options, including IPX.

====&quot;The Kilrathi Saga&quot;====
&quot;Kilrathi Saga&quot; was a limited-edition reissue of the first three &quot;Wing Commander&quot; games (&quot;Wing Commander&quot;, &quot;Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi&quot;, and &quot;Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger&quot;). Origin repaired some of the game&#x27;s known bugs and adjusted the speed to run on the early Pentium processors of the time. At the time of its release only 20,000 copies were published.

&quot;Kilrathi Saga&quot; also featured complete digital re-orchestrations of the original two soundtracks by George Oldziey, but the &quot;Saga&quot; did not include the Secret Missions and Special Operations packs of the first two games. The packs were instead made available for download on the Origin website. Due to the add-on packs not being on the CDs there is a bug that causes some music to not be played during animated sequences in the add-ons.

====&quot;Privateer 2: The Darkening&quot;====

&quot;Privateer 2&quot; was launched in late 1996 by Erin Roberts.

The game features live-action video scenes, directed by Steve Hilliker. The cast included Clive Owen, Mathilda May, Jürgen Prochnow, John Hurt, Christopher Walken, Brian Blessed and Amanda Pays. Dani Behr voiced the onboard computer, also named Dani. The game also featured David Warner, and Jürgen Prochnow, who later played Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn and Commander Paul Gerald, respectively, in the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; feature film. The filming was done at Pinewood Studios in England.

Set in a remote region of the Wing Commander universe in the Tri-System Confederation (a three system government that has almost three thousand-year history of its own parallel to the Terran Confederation history), a cargo ship &quot;Canera&quot; is attacked during landing and crashes into Mendra City on planet Crius in the year 2790 of the Tri-System calendar (the calendar appears to be longer than a Terran year with months that are about 40 days each). One survivor, As Lev Arris, a man with no memory of who he is and no record of his existence prior to two weeks before the crash, awakens from his cryo-sleep and must take on the life of a privateer in the Tri-System, re-discovering his past along the way.

====&quot;Wing Commander Arena&quot;====

Publisher Electronic Arts and developer Gaia Industries revived the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; franchise with a downloadable release on Xbox Live Arcade called &quot;Wing Commander Arena&quot;. Dogfights take place in one of nine environments, and pilots are able to choose from 18 ships. There can be up to 16 players in a single match. The title was released on July 25, 2007. It is set chronologically after Wing Commander Prophecy Gold, and background information is included in the digital Star*Soldier manual.

===Canceled games===

====&quot;Alien Commander&quot;====
Around 1993, Warren Spector developed a pitch for a science fiction game called &quot;Alien Commander&quot;, which would be set in the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; universe. A concept document was produced, however the project was scrapped in favour of proceeding with &quot;System Shock&quot;.

====&quot;Privateer 3&quot;====
Origin aborted several attempts to continue the &quot;Privateer&quot; franchise between 1995 and 2003, by either developing a sequel (&quot;Privateer 3&quot;) or an online game (&quot;Privateer&quot; or &quot;Wing Commander Online&quot;). Only one of these was formally announced. The March 1998 issue of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; featured a cover story on &quot;Privateer 3&quot;. Origin confirmed that development of the game had been canceled shortly after the magazine was published.

====&quot;Strike Team&quot;====
&quot;Wing Commander: Strike Team&quot; was a planned sequel to &quot;Wing Commander: Secret Ops&quot; which focused on multiplayer gameplay. The title was officially announced in an EAUK promotional publication but was canceled early in development.

==Spiritual Successor==
After Origin Systems was bought over by Electronic Arts, Roberts lost the rights to the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; franchise. Although there was an attempt to revive it, Roberts said the publisher &quot;doesn&#x27;t care about that world.&quot; This encouraged him to create a spiritual successor to &quot;Wing Commander&quot; called &quot;Star Citizen&quot; in 2012.

==Novels==
Several novels based on the games have been released by Baen Books. They include novelisations of &quot;WCIII&quot; and &quot;WCIV&quot; as well as offering further depth into known Wing Commander events such as the defection of Ralgha nar Hhallas.

==Television series==

&quot;Wing Commander Academy&quot; is a 13-episode animated series that originally aired on the USA Network between September 21 and December 21, 1996. The series is set before and during the events of the first game and features many familiar ships and characters. The cast featured Mark Hamill, Tom Wilson, and Malcolm McDowell reprising their &quot;Wing Commander&quot; game roles.

==Film==
In 1999, &quot;Wing Commander&quot; was released in theaters. It was directed by Chris Roberts, the creator of the game series, and stars Freddie Prinze, Jr., Saffron Burrows, Matthew Lillard, Tchéky Karyo, Jürgen Prochnow, and David Warner. The film diverged significantly from the established &quot;Wing Commander&quot; universe, and was a critical and commercial failure.

==Collectible card game==
The &quot;Wing Commander: Collectible card game&quot; was an effort to combine the franchise&#x27;s rising fortunes with the rising interest in card games, as &quot;&quot; was revolutionizing gaming centers the world over. The collectible card game (CCG) was based exclusively on the &quot;WC3&quot; intellectual license and contains no characters found elsewhere.

The game supports two players, one as the Kilrathi Empire and one as the Terran Confederation (rules modifications may be made to allow teams of players instead). In the pre-game phase, players set out five &quot;Nav Point&quot; cards in an X pattern, with a Terran and Kilrathi carrier at either end (to form a hexagon). During gameplay, players may deploy fighters, and then deploy pilots and equipment upon those fighters. Every card has its own &quot;Power Point&quot; cost; players start with 30 Power Points and gain two each turn. The designers recommend pencil and paper for the keeping-track of Power Points. Finally, certain cards feature &quot;Medals&quot;, which also feature as a resource, as some elite cards require the &quot;tapping&quot; of Medal-bearing cards to deploy.

Fighters, with pilots and secondary armaments potentially attached, move among the nav points, fighting with each other and attacking the enemy carrier. During combat, either player may play &quot;Maneuver&quot; cards to fortify their fighters (assuming the targeted craft has a high enough Maneuver statistic) or &quot;Battle Damage&quot; cards to cripple their enemies; both have Power Point costs. Attacks are then resolved by comparison of the aggressor&#x27;s Attack value with the defender&#x27;s Defense value (with Support values from allied ships augmenting as appropriate). Each card lost results in the loss of one Power Point as well. There are two ways to win: to destroy the enemy carrier (with the successful use of Torpedo cards) or to reduce the opponent&#x27;s Power Point pool to zero.

<text>A poster child (sometimes poster boy or poster girl) is, according to the original meaning of the term, a child afflicted by some disease or deformity whose picture is used on posters or other media as part of a campaign to raise money or enlist volunteers for a cause or organization. Such campaigns may be part of an annual effort or event, and may include the name and age of a specific child along with other personally identifiable attributes.

In modern times, a &quot;poster child&quot; is a person of any age whose attributes or behaviour are emblematic of a known cause, movement, circumstance or ideal. The person in question is thought of as an embodiment or archetype. This signifies that the very identity of the subject is synonymous with the associated ideal; or otherwise representative of its most favorable or least favorable aspects.

== Examples ==

* Bobbi Campbell was a self-professed &quot;AIDS poster boy&quot; in the earliest years of the epidemic.
* Willie Horton became a poster boy for a prison furlough program in the US and the liberal sensibilities of Michael Dukakis in the 1988 United States presidential election campaign.
* Emily Susan Rapp was a poster child for the March of Dimes in the US, following the amputation of her leg at age four, due to a congenital birth defect.
* Aziz Shavershian was described as the poster boy of a subculture of amateur bodybuilding in Australia, dubbed &quot;aesthetics&quot;, and gained a large cult following of admirers.
* Ryan White was considered a poster child for social acceptance of AIDS sufferers, after he contracted the disease from a blood transfusion and was expelled from his school.

<text>Barbara Lynn Cubin (née Turner; born November 30, 1946) is an American politician who was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, Wyoming&#x27;s sole member of that body. She was the first woman elected to Congress from Wyoming.

==Early life, education==
Cubin was born in Salinas, California. She grew up in Casper, Wyoming, and graduated from high school there. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska.

Cubin worked as a substitute science and math teacher, and was employed full-time as a social worker for senior citizens and disabled adults. She later worked for the state Labor Department and Ironworkers&#x27; Union to train minorities and Vietnam War veterans to become iron workers.

In 1974, Cubin joined the Wyoming Machinery Company as a chemist, and in 1975, began managing the office of her husband, Fritz Cubin, a physician.

== Personal ==
Cubin and her husband Fritz married in 1975 and had two children. Fritz Cubin, who was a doctor, died in 2010 after a decade of serious health problems.

In past elections, Cubin fended off attacks on missed floor votes, which she attributed to her husband&#x27;s severe health problems. Cubin also has had health issues of her own. In 1993 and 1995, she had surgeries related to her gall bladder. In July 2005, she suffered a mild heart attack and underwent surgery to place a stent in an artery that was 70 percent blocked.

Cubin is an Episcopalian.

== Early political career ==
Cubin began her political career in November 1986, when she was elected to the Wyoming House of Representatives from Natrona County, Wyoming. She served there for six years. During the 1992 session, she was the primary sponsor of legislation that put on the ballot an initiative that would create the sentence of life without parole.

In November 1992, Cubin was elected to the Wyoming Senate, representing part of Casper, Wyoming. She served there for two years before being elected to the U.S. House.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
=== 1994 election ===
In November 1994, Cubin ran for Wyoming&#x27;s U.S. House seat, to succeed Republican Craig Thomas, who was running for (and would be elected to) the United States Senate. Cubin defeated eight other Republicans in the primary, then won the general election against Bob Schuster, a wealthy Jackson attorney and then-partner of prominent trial attorney Gerry Spence.

Cubin&#x27;s first race was very close by Wyoming standards (Wyoming is one of the most Republican states in the nation), with Cubin getting 53% of the vote. It was also the most expensive campaign in state history.

Cubin became the first woman to win an election for federal office in the state of Wyoming.

=== Subsequent elections ===
In 1996, Cubin was re-elected with 55 percent. Subsequent races were less close, until 2004, when she again won with 55% of the vote. By contrast, George W. Bush won the state with 69 percent of the vote. In 2006, Cubin won her seat again, but barely, registering 48 percent of the vote to her Democratic opponent Gary Trauner&#x27;s 48 percent.

===Committees===
Early in her House tenure, she served on the House Science Committee. In her last terms in office, she was a member of the House Resources Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. In the wake of the Democratic takeover of Congress in the 2006 elections, Cubin served only on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as a Member of both the Health and Telecommunications Subcommittees.

===Political positions===
Cubin&#x27;s voting record is conservative: the American Conservative Union gave her 2005 voting record a rating of 96 points out of 100.

An opponent of abortion in any form, Cubin consistently voted for restrictions on abortion and against funding of family planning groups that provide abortion services, counseling or advocacy.

In 2006, Cubin was listed as cosponsoring legislation that would sell off some federal land to help pay for Hurricane Katrina and other disaster relief. Cubin maintains she never signed on to the legislation, saying there must have been a clerical error. About 42 percent of Wyoming&#x27;s land is owned by the federal government, including Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.

Relatedly, she focused much of her attention on the mining and land use issues important to Wyoming. She cofounded the Congressional Mining Caucus and introduced legislation to allow mining companies operating on federal lands to pay taxes in minerals rather than dollars.

With regard to global warming, Cubin has stated that &quot;there still exists broad disagreement within the scientific community on the extent to which humans actually contribute to the Earth&#x27;s temperature changes.&quot;

The League of Conservation Voters, a nonpartisan PAC, gave Cubin a lifetime rating of 3 on a scale of 0 to 100. In 2006, she scored a 0.

In 2000, she was appointed to be a member of the National Rifle Association of America Board of Directors.

During her time in the House, Cubin rose into the ranks of Republican leadership, holding the posts of Deputy Majority Whip, Conference Secretary, and member of the Steering Committee.

Cubin was a supporter of impeaching President Bill Clinton. In November 1997, Cubin was one of eighteen House Republicans to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Cubin voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Cubin voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the majority of votes needed to be adopted).

==Controversies==

=== Racial comment ===
On April 9, 2003, Cubin said on the House floor, &quot;My sons are 25 and 30. They are blond-haired and blue-eyed. One amendment today said we could not sell guns to anybody under drug treatment. So does that mean if you go into a black community, you cannot sell a gun to any black person, or does that mean because my …&quot; Representative Melvin Watt, (D-N.C.), who is black, interrupted and demanded that Cubin retract the statement. Cubin said that she did not mean to offend her &quot;neighbors&quot; on the Democratic side, and maintained that her comment was within House rules.

On the motion from Watt to strike Cubin&#x27;s words, the motion was defeated along mostly party lines of 227 to 195, with 4 Democrats voting with the Republicans.

===Slap===
On October 22, 2006, after a televised debate with Democratic candidate Gary Trauner and Libertarian candidate Thomas Rankin, Cubin approached Rankin, who has multiple sclerosis and is a wheelchair user. Rankin states that Cubin said, &quot;If you weren&#x27;t sitting in that chair, I&#x27;d slap you across the face.&quot; Rankin called her comment an inappropriate slur to the disabled. Rankin maintains he said nothing to Cubin before her remark.

=== ARMPAC ===
The Wyoming Democratic Party has repeatedly called for Cubin to return the $22,520 she received from Tom DeLay&#x27;s Americans for a Republican Majority political action committee (ARMPAC).

On July 23, 2006 the &quot;Casper Star-Tribune&quot; reported Cubin &quot;will keep the money she received from former Rep. Tom DeLay&#x27;s fundraising committee even though the organization has been fined for campaign finance violations and is shutting down.&quot; ARMPAC agreed to pay a fine to the Federal Election Commission for &quot;misstatements of financial activity, failure to report debts and obligations and failure to properly allocate expenses between federal and non-federal accounts.&quot;&quot; Later in 2006, Cubin said she would return the money if DeLay was convicted. DeLay was convicted, though his conviction was reversed on appeal in 2013 by Texas Republican judges.

==2008 retirement==
Cubin announced in 2008 that she would not be a candidate for re-election that year. Former Wyoming State Treasurer Cynthia Lummis became the Republican nominee for Wyoming&#x27;s At-Large U.S. House District. After her victory in the general election, Lummis succeeded Cubin in the U.S. House of Representatives.

<text>Health in China is a complex and multifaceted issue that encompasses a wide range of factors, including public health policy, healthcare infrastructure, environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and socioeconomic conditions.Although China has made significant progress in improving public health and life expectancy, many challenges remain, including air pollution, food safety concerns, a growing burden of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and an aging population. In order to improve the situation, the Chinese Government has adopted a series of health policies and initiatives, such as the Healthy China 2030 program, investment in the development of primary health-care facilities and the implementation of public health campaigns.

Health care services in China are primarily provided by state-owned hospitals. Health insurance is primarily operated by local government.

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that China is fulfilling 98.4% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to health based on its level of income. When looking at the right to health with respect to children, China achieves 98.6% of what is expected based on its current income. In regards to the right to health amongst the adult population, the country achieves 97% of what is expected based on the nation&#x27;s level of income. When considering the right to reproductive health, the nation is fulfilling 99.6% of what the nation is expected to achieve based on the resources (income) it has available. Overall, China falls into the &quot;good&quot; category when evaluating the right to health.

== Current health care institutions ==
Healthcare services in China are primarily provided by state-owned hospitals. State-owned hospitals provide services for approximately 90% of patients in China. State-owned hospitals are larger than private hospitals and have better physicians and medical equipment. The government regulates the price of services and wages for state-owned hospital personnel.

Health insurance is primarily operated by local governments.

==Post-1949 history==
=== 1949 - 1976 ===
An emphasis on public health and preventive treatment characterized health policy from the beginning of the 1950s. At that time the party began to mobilize the population to engage in mass &quot;patriotic health campaigns&quot; aimed at improving the low level of environmental sanitation and hygiene and attacking certain diseases. These public health measures contributed to a major decrease in mortality.

In 1956, China began a public health campaign to eliminate schistosoma-carrying snails. Beginning in 1958, the &quot;four pests&quot; campaign sought to eliminate rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes. Particular efforts were devoted in the health campaigns to improving water quality through such measures as deep-well construction and human-waste treatment. Only in the larger cities had human waste been centrally disposed of. In the countryside, where &quot;night soil&quot; has always been collected and applied to the fields as fertilizer, it was a major source of disease. Since the 1950s, rudimentary treatments such as storage in pits, composting, and mixture with chemicals have been implemented. As a result of preventive efforts, such epidemic diseases as cholera, bubonic plague, typhoid fever, and scarlet fever have almost been eradicated. The mass mobilization approach proved particularly successful in the fight against syphilis, which was reportedly eliminated by the 1960s. The incidence of other infectious and parasitic diseases was reduced and controlled.

Political turmoil and famine following the failure of the Great Leap Forward led to the starvation of 20 million people in China. Beginning in 1961 the recovery had more moderate policies inaugurated by President Liu Shaoqi ended starvation and improved nutrition. The coming of the Cultural Revolution weakened epidemic control, causing a rebound in epidemic diseases and malnutrition in some areas.

Before the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), the Ministry of Health focused on the delivery of health care in urban hospitals. Mao criticized Minister of Health Qian Xinzhong for promoting this health care model, arguing that an urban hospital-focused health care model failed to treat peasants and focused on cure rather than preventative medicine. Mao also criticized the Ministry itself as the Ministry &quot;of urban overlords&quot;.

With the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong introduced a new approach to public health, especially in rural areas. In his June 26 Directive, Mao prioritized healthcare and medicine for rural people throughout the country. As a result, clinics and hospitals sent their staff on medical tours of rural areas.

Rural cooperative medical systems provided subsidized health care to rural residents. One aspect of this system was barefoot doctors, who received some training and then delivered primary care medicine to those who needed it. Barefoot doctors were a good contribution to primary health systems in China during the Cultural Revolution. It encompasses all principles stated in primary health care. Community participation is possible because the team is composed of village health workers in the area. There is equity because it was more available and combined western and traditional medicines. Intersectoral coordination is achieved by preventive measures rather than curative. Lastly it is comprehensive using rural practices rather than urban ones.

=== 1976 - 2003 ===

By the late 1970s, China&#x27;s national health system covered almost the entire urban population and 85% of the rural population. The World Bank described this success as &quot;an unrivaled achievement among low-income countries.&quot;

The &quot;barefoot doctor system&quot; was based in the people&#x27;s communes. In the 1980s, with the disappearance of the people&#x27;s communes and the rural cooperative medical system, the barefoot doctor system lost its base and funding. The Chinese government began to push for privatization of health care and, as a result, stopped providing necessary funding. Instead, according to Blumenthal et al. (2005), individual towns were now responsible for ensuring that people were receiving adequate health care, which caused disparities between wealthier and poorer regions. Additionally, the decollectivization of agriculture resulted in a decreased desire on the part of the rural populations to support the collective welfare system, of which health care was a part. In 1984 surveys showed that only 40 to 45 percent of the rural population was covered by an organized cooperative medical system, as compared with 80 to 90 percent in 1979.

This shift entailed a number of important consequences for rural health care. The lack of financial resources for the cooperatives resulted in a decrease in the number of barefoot doctors, which meant that health education and primary and home care suffered and that in some villages sanitation and water supplies were checked less frequently. Also, the failure of the cooperative health care system limited the funds available for continuing education for barefoot doctors, thereby hindering their ability to provide adequate preventive and curative services. The costs of medical treatment increased, deterring some patients from obtaining necessary medical attention. If the patients could not pay for services received, then the financial responsibility fell on the hospitals and commune health centers, in some cases creating large debts.

Consequently, in the post-Mao era of modernization, the rural areas were forced to adapt to a changing health care environment. Many barefoot doctors went into private practice, operating on a fee-for-service basis and charging for medication. But soon farmers demanded better medical services as their incomes increased, bypassing the barefoot doctors and going straight to the commune health centers or county hospitals. A number of barefoot doctors left the medical profession after discovering that they could earn a better living from farming, and their services were not replaced. The leaders of brigades, through which local health care was administered, also found farming to be more lucrative than their salaried positions, and many of them left their jobs. Many of the cooperative medical programs collapsed. Farmers in some brigades established voluntary health-insurance programs but had difficulty organizing and administering them.

Their income for many basic medical services limited by regulations, Chinese grassroots health care providers has supported themselves by charging for giving injections and selling medicines. This has led to a serious problem of disease spread through health care as patients received too many injections and injections by unsterilized needles. Corruption and disregard for the rights of patients have become serious problems in the Chinese health care system.

The Chinese economist, Yang Fan, wrote in 2001 that lip service being given to the old socialist health care system and deliberately ignoring and failing to regulate the actual private health care system is a serious failing of the Chinese health care system. &quot;The old argument that &quot;health is a kind of welfare to save lives and assist the injured&quot; is so far removed from reality that things are really more like its opposite. The welfare health system supported by public funds essentially exists in name only. People have to pay for most medical services on their own. Considering health to be still a &quot;welfare activity&quot; has for some time been a major obstacle to the development of proper physician - patient relationship and to the law applicable to that relationship.&quot;

Despite the decline of the public health care system during the first decade of the reform era, Chinese health improved sharply as a result of greatly improved nutrition, especially in rural areas, and the recovery of the epidemic control system, which had been neglected during the Cultural Revolution.

=== 2003 - present ===
From late 2002 to early 2003 the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak began in China and spread across the world. In the early stages of disease spread, the Chinese government withheld information and may have contributed to the further spreading of the disease. In addition, China&#x27;s health care system was still fairly decentralized, with a noticeable lack of oversight and little potential for rapid coordination. Thus, the SARS epidemic highlighted the need for the Chinese government to begin restructuring its health care distribution. One big issue many have pointed out, including Blumenthal (2005) and Yip et al. (2008), is that much of China&#x27;s population does not have access to affordable health insurance. As a solution, the Chinese government planned to provide universal health insurance to all citizens by 2020. To get closer to this goal, the Chinese government began a health insurance program known as the New Cooperative Health Scheme, which gave mainly rural Chinese residents limited insurance coverage for emergencies. Alongside the insurance measures, the Chinese government returned to the successful public health endeavors of the Cultural Revolution by instituting community health centers in urban neighborhoods with the goal of providing affordable options to hospital care. Dong (2008) also mentions that China has been working to reinstate the cooperative medical systems in rural areas by pushing for state-funded health centers to be established. That being said, some studies, such as Dib (2008) have shown that the quality of health care in rural areas still varies widely depending on wealth of the region. Despite debates surrounding the effectiveness of China&#x27;s revamped health system, the COVID-19 outbreak of 2019-2020 has shown that things have changed since the SARS outbreak of 2003. Specifically, the Chinese government notified their citizens and the rest of the world of the first cases of the outbreak much sooner than SARS in 2003. While it took around four to five months for a public statement on SARS after the first case, it only took about one month for the COVID-19. Because their response escalated more quickly, the food market thought to be at the center of the outbreak was also shut down sooner than the one that had been the source of the 2003 SARS outbreak. In addition to a more rapid response, the Chinese government quickly established committees and consortia made up of both Chinese and international experts to begin exploring methods to combat the outbreak.

==Health indicators==

Some measures used to indicate health include Total Fertility Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Life Expectancy, Crude Birth and Death Rate. As of 2017, China has a Total Fertility Rate of 1.6 children born per woman, an Infant Mortality rate of 10 deaths per 1000 live births, Crude Birth Rate of 13 births per 1000 people and a Death Rate of 7 deaths per 1000 people. Since 1949, China had a huge improvement in population&#x27;s health. There are health related parameters:

* data from www.gapminder.org.

In general, all indices showed improvement except the drop around 1960 due to the failure of the Great Leap Forward, which led to the starvation of tens of millions of people. From 1950 to 2012, life expectancy nearly doubled (41.6-75.1). Total Fertility Rate changed from 5.3 to 1.7 which mainly caused by One-child policy. Infant Mortality rate and Under-5 mortality rate went down sharply. Though there is no data from 1963 to 1967, we can see the trend. The gap between IMR and U5MR became smaller and smaller, which indicates health in children has been promoted.
Maternal Mortality Ratio is not shown in the graph due to having insufficient data, but it did go down from 164.5(1980) to 26.5(2011).

As of at least 2023, China&#x27;s life expectancy exceeds 78 years and is slightly higher than life expectancy in the United States.

=== One-child policy ===

Created in 1979, under Deng Xiaoping, the One-child policy incentivized families to have children later and to only have one child or risk penalization. The One-child policy was a program created by the Chinese government as a reaction to the increasing population during the 1970s, that was thought to have negatively impacted China&#x27;s economic growth. Implementation of the program included rewarding families who followed the program, fining families who resisted the policy, offering birth control/ contraceptives, and in some cases forced abortions. The policy was unevenly implemented throughout China and was easier established in urban areas rather than rural, because of ideals about family size and gender preferences. Prior to the One-child policy, the Chinese government had encouraged families to have more children in order to increase the future workforce, however, this promotion made the population of China in the 1970s increase at an alarming rate. Additionally, voluntary programs, involving family planning and contraceptive use, were proposed before the One-child policy was fully enforced.

Effects of the policy

In 2015, the one-child policy of Deng Xiaoping was replaced by a two-child policy, which increased the number of &quot;allowed&quot; children to two. With this, scholars began evaluating the effects of the one-child policy. The One-child policy was successful in halting China&#x27;s increasing population and decreased both the birth rate and population, however, the harsh enforcement of the policy created long-term changes to some of China&#x27;s health indicators. For instance, favoring males over female children lead to many forced abortions, infanticide and abandoned female children which led to an imbalance of men to women in China. Additionally, birth rates and rate of natural increase decreased as a result of the One-child policy. Other consequences of the One-child policy include difficulties accessing education and employment as a result of being an undocumented birth.

In terms of positive outcomes, as Zeng and Hesketh (2016) explain, the Chinese government cites the decreased fertility rate resulting from the one-child policy as a determining factor in China&#x27;s rapidly increasing GDP. However, Zeng and Hesketh (2016) as well as Zhang (2017) also mention that other scholars argue China&#x27;s fertility rate would have decreased as the country became more and more developed, regardless of whether the one-child policy had been in place or not. Zhang (2017) notes that one predicted positive outcome of having less children was that families would invest more money and other resources in the children they did have, leading to a healthier and more successful population. However, follow-up studies on this claim have examined child education outcomes and found that the effects of the one-child policy on education rates was &quot;not statistically significant&quot;.

=== Dependency ratio ===
China&#x27;s dependency ratio is unfavorable because of the policy and its elderly population (65+) will outgrow the working aged people. The elderly population in China is highly reliant on the working aged people for support and the number of dependents (children 0–14, adults 65+) are increasing compared to the number of working aged people. China&#x27;s population is aging and the number of children born is less than the replacement rate.

==Medical issues in China==

===Smoking===
Smoking is very prevalent in China. In fact, China has the largest smoking population in the world. One of the most direct consequences of the popularity of smoking in China is lung cancer, and lung cancer is the single biggest contributor to the frequency of cancer in China. Parascandola and Xiao (2015) refer to the prevalence of lung cancer in China as an epidemic. Collecting data on the topic is complicated by the fact that lung cancer can also stem from China&#x27;s air pollution. Regardless, smoking related illnesses killed 1.2 million in the People&#x27;s Republic of China; however, the state tobacco monopoly, the China National Tobacco Corporation, supplies 7 to 10% of government revenues, as of 2011, 600 billion yuan, about 100 billion US dollars. As a result, although movements for tobacco smoking cessation exist and have been gaining popularity, the financial benefit of the smoking industry stands in the way of more effective cessation programming. In addition, the practice of smoking is intertwined with Chinese culture which further complicates the relationship between China and smoking. Smoking is central to socialization in many public spaces, although mainly men participate in the practice. With these complicating factors, it has been difficult to effectively reduce tobacco use and smoking. For example, a Chinese official in 2007 mentioned that if smoking were banned, it would result in social upheaval. After a decline from 2014 to 2016 as several major Chinese cities introduced tough indoor smoking bans, cigarette sales are still rising, reaching 2.44 trillion in 2023.

===Betel chewing===
Chewing betel nut, an addictive group 1 carcinogen, is popular in China. According to research predictions, by 2030, the number of betel nut related oral cancer cases in China will exceed 1 million. The medical burden caused by betel nut related oral cancer in China will exceed 200 billion yuan.

=== Sex education, contraception, and women&#x27;s health ===
Sex education lags in China due to cultural conservatism. From ancient China to the first half of the 20th century, formal sex education was not taught. Instead, a woman&#x27;s parents were mostly responsible for her sex education after she is wed. Many Chinese feel that sex education should be limited to biological science. Combined with migration of young unmarried women to the cities, lack of knowledge of contraception has resulted in increasing numbers of abortions by young women.

The Basic Health Services Project piloted strategies to ensure equitable access to China&#x27;s rural health system; health outcomes for women improved significantly, with substantial declines in maternal mortality due to increased coverage of maternal health services.

===SARS===
Although not identified until later, China&#x27;s first case of a new, highly contagious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), occurred in Guangdong in November 2002, and within three months the Ministry of Health reported 300 SARS cases and five deaths in the province. Dr. Jiang Yanyong exposed the level of danger the SARS outbreak posed to China. By May 2003, some 8,000 cases of SARS had been reported worldwide; about 66 percent of the cases and 349 deaths occurred in China alone. By early summer 2003, the SARS epidemic had ceased. A vaccine was developed and first-round testing on human volunteers completed in 2004.

The 2002 SARS in China demonstrated at once the decline of the PRC epidemic reporting system, the deadly consequences of secrecy on health matters and, on the positive side, the ability of the Chinese central government to command a massive mobilization of resources once its attention is focused on one particular issue. Despite the suppression of news regarding the outbreak during the early stages of the epidemic, the outbreak was soon contained and cases of SARS failed to emerge. Obsessive secrecy seriously delayed the isolation of SARS by Chinese scientists. On 18 May 2004, the World Health Organization announced the PRC free of further cases of SARS.

===COVID-19 pandemic===

A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, started in December 2019. It was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China. Its severity has surpassed of the 2003 SARS outbreak. On 30 January, the outbreak was declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Wider concerns about consequences of the outbreak include political and economic instability. Political fallout has included the firing of several local leaders of the Chinese Communist Party for their poor response to the outbreak. Outbreak-related incidents of xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent have been reported in several countries. The spread of misinformation and disinformation about the virus, primarily online, has been described as an &quot;infodemic&quot; by the WHO.

===Hepatitis B===
Work with the CDC has created goals of decelerating the spread of Hepatitis B through immunization efforts. However, Hepatitis B is still widespread in China and has been determined by Wang et al. (2019) to have &quot;higher intermediate prevalence (5-7.99%)&quot;. In fact, no country has a higher prevalence of Hepatitis B than China and one third of the world&#x27;s Hepatitis B-afflicted individuals are thought to reside in China. Hepatitis B in China was even described as an &quot;epidemic&quot; in Chen et al. (2018). Some socioeconomic factors that contribute to the continued prevalence of Hepatitis B in China are first the high medical cost related to treatment. Second, the stigma that surrounds the disease causes the importance of Hepatitis B testing to go undiscussed in that people who disclose their Hepatitis B positive status may be discriminated against. These combine to cause a situation where many people in China do not even realize that they are infected with the disease and thus unknowingly may succumb to the disease or pass it on to others.

===HIV and AIDS===

The AIDS disaster of Henan in the mid-1990s is estimated to be the largest man-made health catastrophe, affecting five-hundred thousand to one million persons. It was also in Hebei, Anhui, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hubei and Guizhou. HIV was transmitted via blood sale. Blood plasma mixture from several persons was returned so that same person could give blood up to 11 times a day. The disaster was only recognized in 2000 and found out abroad in 2001. Pensioner Gao Yaojie sold her house to deliver data leaflets of HIV to people, while officials tried to prevent her. Some local officials and politicians were involved in the blood sale. In 2003 only 2.6% of Chinese knew that a condom could protect from AIDS.

Authorities blocked protests over ineffective drug treatments, cancelled meetings on HIV groups, and detained or put under house arrest prominent activists including the 2005 Reebok Human Rights Award winner Li Dan, eighty-year-old AIDS activist Dr. Gao Yaojie, and the husband-and-wife HIV activist team of Hu Jia (activist) and Zeng Jinyan.

China, similar to other nations with migrant and socially mobile populations, has experienced increased incidences of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). By the mid-1980s, some Chinese physicians recognized HIV and AIDS as a serious health threat but considered it to be a &quot;foreign problem&quot;. As of mid-1987 only two Chinese citizens had died from AIDS and monitoring of foreigners had begun. Following a 1987 regional World Health Organization meeting, the Chinese government announced it would join the global fight against AIDS, which would involve quarantine inspection of people entering China from abroad, medical supervision of people vulnerable to AIDS, and establishment of AIDS laboratories in coastal cities. Within China, the rapid increase in venereal disease, prostitution and drug addiction, internal migration since the 1980s and poorly supervised plasma collection practices, especially by the Henan provincial authorities, created conditions for a serious outbreak of HIV in the early 1990s.

As of 2005 about 1 million Chinese have been infected with HIV, leading to about 150,000 AIDS deaths. Projections are for about 10 million cases by 2010 if nothing is done. Effective preventive measures have become a priority at the highest levels of the government, but progress is slow. A promising pilot program exists in Gejiu partially funded by international donors.

===Tuberculosis===

Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in China, which has the world&#x27;s second largest tuberculosis epidemic (after India). Progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control can be linked to a malfunctioning health system. Prevalent smoking aggravates its spread.

===Leprosy===
Leprosy, also known as Hansen&#x27;s disease, was officially eliminated at the national level in China by 1982, meaning prevalence is lower than 1 in 100,000. There are 3,510 active cases today. Though leprosy has been brought under control in general, the situation in some areas is worsening, according to China&#x27;s Ministry of Health.

===Malaria===

Plasmodium vivax malaria is the most common malaria in China, followed by P. falciparum malaria, while Plasmodium vivax malaria and Plasmodium ovale malaria are less common. P. falciparum malaria occurs mainly in the southwest and Hainan, while P. vivax malaria occurs in the northeast, north and northwest of China.

Since the 1950s, Chinese health authorities have worked to detect and prevent the spread of malaria by providing prophylactic anti-malarial drugs to people at risk of malaria and treating patients, and in 1967 the Chinese government launched the research &quot;Project 523&quot;. This work resulted in the antimalarial artemisinin-based combination therapies. One of the team members, Tu Youyou, was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her work.

In the 1980s, began to experiment on a large scale with the use of drugs to prevent malaria. By 1988, the use of nets greatly reduced the incidence of malaria. By the end of 1990, the number of malaria cases in China had fallen to 117,000, and deaths had been reduced by 95 per cent. China was free of malaria cases for four consecutive years starting in 2017. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that malaria had been eliminated in China in 2021.

===Mental health===
100 million Chinese people have mental illnesses that are varying degrees of intensity. Currently, dilemmas such as human rights versus political control, community integration versus community control, diversity versus centrally, huge demand but inadequate services seem to challenge the further development of the mental health service in the PRC. China has 17,000 certified psychologists, which is ten percent of that of other developed countries per capita.

===Nutrition===

In the 2000–2002 period, China had one of the highest per capita caloric intakes in Asia, second only to South Korea and higher than countries such as Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia. In 2003, daily per capita caloric intake was 2,940 (vegetable products 78%, animal products 22%); 125% of FAO recommended minimum requirement.

===Malnutrition among rural children===

China has been developing rapidly for the past 30 years. Though it has uplifted a huge number of people out of poverty, many social issues still remain unsolved. One of them is malnutrition among rural children in China. The problem has diminished but still remains a pertinent national issue. In a survey done in 1998, the stunting rate among children in China was 22 percent and was as high as 46 percent in poor provinces. This shows the huge disparity between urban and rural areas. In 2002, Svedberg found that stunting rate in rural areas of China was 15 percent, reflecting that a substantial number of children still suffer from malnutrition. Another study by Chen shows that malnutrition has dropped from 1990 to 1995 but regional differences are still huge, particularly in rural areas.

In a recent report by The Rural Education Action Project on children in rural China, many were found to be suffering from basic health problems. 34% have iron deficiency anaemia and 40 percent are infected with intestinal worms. Many of these children do not have proper or sufficient nutrition. Often, this causes them not being able to fully reap the benefits of education, which can be a ticket out of poverty.

One possible reason for poor nutrition in rural areas is that agricultural produce can fetch a decent price, and thus is often sold rather than kept for personal consumption. Rural families would not consume eggs that their hen lay but will sell it in the market for about 20 yuan per kilogram. The money will then be spent on books or food like instant noodles which lack nutrition value compared to an egg. A girl named Wang Jing in China has a bowl of pork only once every five to six weeks, compared to urban children who have a vast array of food chains to choose from.

A survey conducted by China&#x27;s Ministry of Health showed the kind of food consumed by rural households. 30 percent consume meat less than once a month. 23 percent consume rice or egg less than once a month.

In a 2008 Report on Chinese Children Nutrition and Health Conditions, West China still has 7.6 million poor children who were shorter and weigh lesser than urban children. These rural children were also shorter by 4 centimetres and 0.6 kilograms lighter than World Health Organization standards. It can be concluded that children in West China still lack quality nutrition.

====Epidemiological studies====
The most comprehensive epidemiological study of nutrition ever conducted was the China-Oxford-Cornell Study on Dietary, Lifestyle and Disease Mortality Characteristics in 65 Rural Chinese Counties, known as the &quot;China Project&quot;, which began in 1983. Its findings are discussed in &quot;The China Study&quot; by T. Colin Campbell.

=== Environment and health ===

China&#x27;s rapid development has led to numerous environmental problems which all have a direct impact on health. According to Kan (2009) the environmental issues include &quot;outdoor and indoor air pollution, water shortages and pollution, desertification, and soil pollution&quot;. Of these, Kan (2009) states that the most detrimental one is the outdoor air pollution for which China has become known. In Liu et al.&#x27;s research (2018) on this issue specifically, the major health effects are listed as &quot;including adverse cardiovascular, respiratory, pulmonary, and other health-related outcomes&quot;. The air pollution is not limited to industrial cities. In fact, due to the fact that rural Chinese people still use fuels such as coal for cooking, the World Health Organization attributes more premature deaths to that sort of air pollution than to China&#x27;s ambient air pollution. In addition, many factories are located in the countryside, which exacerbates rural air pollution. Despite China&#x27;s notoriously poor air quality, Matus et al. (2011) have found that the severity of China&#x27;s air pollution has been declining over the years.

Finally, as described by Kan (2018) and Wu, et al. (1999) another major contributor to adverse health effects related to environmental issues is water pollution. In rural areas, this is once again due to factories located nearby. In urban areas on the other hand, China&#x27;s water sanitation systems have not yet caught up with the needs of the population. As a result, the water is often contaminated with human waste and is not considered potable. Ingestion of contaminated water has caused diseases such as cholera.

==== Climate change ====
===Infection from animals===

The first known human contraction of Avian Influenza (bird flu), after contact with live poultry in February 2018, was diagnosed to a woman living in the Jiangsu Province of China.

Pig-human transmission of the &quot;Streptococcus suis&quot; bacteria was reported in 2005, which led to 38 deaths in and around Sichuan province, an unusually high number. Although the bacteria exists in other pig rearing countries, the pig-human transmission has only been reported in China.

==Hygiene and sanitation==
Many of China&#x27;s water sources, including underground sources and rivers, have been heavily polluted because of industry and economic growth. Increased exposure to polluted water and air has created &quot;cancer villages&quot; and further health and environmental problems. A majority of groundwater and shallow wells surveyed in China showed signs of heavy pollution, by measuring nitrate levels which indicate water contamination

By 2002, 92 percent of the urban population and 8 percent of the rural population had access to an improved water supply, and 69 percent of the urban population and 32 percent of the rural population had access to improved sanitation facilities.

Although China has made great efforts of making sanitary facilities and safe water more accessible, there are water and sanitation disparities all over China. As of 2012, sanitary facilities were available to 69% of the Chinese people and 71% of water in China is piped, yet it is still difficult preserving drinking water that is affordable and efficient at a communal level. Additionally, water in both urban and rural areas of China are still vulnerable to disease, pollution, and contamination, with rural areas at higher risk of sewage contamination.

The lack of sanitation in multiple areas of China has affected many student for decades. An absence of modern-day toilets and hand washing areas have directly affected students nationwide. The lack of reliable drinking water and sanitation areas, along with many others health issues, has directly led to 1/3 of young students in China having intestinal parasites.

The Patriotic Health Campaign, first started in the 1950s, are campaigns aimed to improve sanitation and hygiene in China. UNICEF also plans to incorporate government programs and policies in order to improve normal health standards in China. The programs and policies are used to teach students about basic hygiene and form campaigns encouraging people to wash their hands with soap instead of water only.

== Measure ==
China has made significant progress in improving public health over the past few decades, with life expectancy increasing from 67.8 years in 1981 to 76.7 years in 2019. The Chinese government has implemented a range of health policies and initiatives, including the Healthy China 2030 program, which aims to improve public health outcomes by addressing major health challenges such as chronic diseases, infectious diseases, and environmental health hazards.

The healthcare system in China is a mix of public and private providers, with the government responsible for providing basic healthcare services to the population. However, there are significant disparities in access to healthcare between urban and rural areas, as well as between different socioeconomic groups.

In recent years, China has made efforts to improve its healthcare infrastructure, including investing in the development of primary healthcare facilities and expanding health insurance coverage. Additionally, the government has implemented a number of public health campaigns, such as anti-smoking and anti-obesity initiatives.

Despite these efforts, there is still much work to be done to improve health outcomes in China. Ongoing efforts are needed to address the root causes of health disparities and to promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors among the population.

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that China is fulfilling 98.4% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to health based on its level of income. When looking at the right to health with respect to children, China achieves 98.6% of what is expected based on its current income. In regards to the right to health amongst the adult population, the country achieves 97% of what is expected based on the nation&#x27;s level of income. When considering the right to reproductive health, the nation is fulfilling 99.6% of what the nation is expected to achieve based on the resources (income) it has available. Overall, China falls into the &quot;good&quot; category when evaluating the right to health.

==WHO in China==
The World Health Organization (WHO) Constitution came into force on 7 April 1948, and China has been a Member since the beginning.

The WHO China office has increased its scope of activities significantly in recent years, especially following the major SARS outbreak of 2003. The role of WHO China is to provide support for the government&#x27;s health programs, working closely with the Ministry of Health and other partners within the government, as well as with UN agencies and other organizations.

China&#x27;s government with WHO assistance and support has strengthened public health in the nation. The current Five Year Plan incorporates public health in a significant way. The government has acknowledged that even as millions upon millions of citizens are prospering amid the country&#x27;s economic boom, millions of others are lagging behind, with healthcare many cannot afford. The challenge for China is to strengthen its health care system across the spectrum, to reduce the disparities and create a more equitable situation regarding access to health care services for the population at large.

At the same time, in an ever-interconnected world, China has embraced its responsibility to global public health, including the strengthening of surveillance systems aimed at swiftly identifying and tackling the threat of infectious diseases such as SARS and avian influenza. Another major challenge is the epidemic of HIV/AIDS, a key priority for China.

The staff of the WHO Office in China are working with their national counterparts in the following areas:
* Healthcare systems development
* Immunization
* Tuberculosis control
* HIV/AIDS control
* Maternal health and child health
* Injury prevention
* Avian influenza control
* Food safety
* Tobacco control
* Non-communicable diseases control
* Environment and health
* Communicable diseases surveillance and response

In addition, WHO technical experts in specialty areas can be made available on a short-term basis, when requested by the Chinese government. China is an active, contributing member of WHO, and has made valuable contributions to global and regional health policy. Technical experts from China have contributed to WHO through their membership on various WHO technical expert advisory committees and groups.

<doc id="407908" wikidata="Q981207" url="?curid=407908" title="Sir Godfrey Copley, 2nd Baronet">
<text>Sir Godfrey Copley, 2nd Baronet FRS (; c. 1653 – 9 April 1709) of Sprotbrough House, near Doncaster, West Riding of Yorkshire, was an English landowner, art-collector and Tory politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1679 and 1709.

==Early life==
Copley was the son of Sir Godfrey Copley (1623–1677), who was created baronet by King Charles II in 1661, and his first wife Eleanor Walmesley, daughter of Sir Thomas Walmesley, MP, of Dunkenhalgh, Lancashire. He was admitted at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 18 November 1674. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s baronetcy and estates in February 1678 and continued his father&#x27;s term in office as High Sheriff of Yorkshire from February to November 1678. He became a major landowner in Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire, holding lands in Sprotbrough, Newton, Cusworth, Cadeby, Wildthorpe, Loversall, Doncaster, Bentley and Warmsworth, among other places.

==Career==

Copley was returned as Member of Parliament for Aldborough in 1679 and sat to 1685. He was admitted at Inner Temple in 1681. He married Catherine, daughter of John Purcell of Nantcribba, Montgomeryshire by licence dated 15 October 1681. He was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1691. and regularly met with literary and political figures in London taverns, developing a wide range of interests in political matters. Following Catherine&#x27;s death, he married again with a settlement dated 31 May 1700, Gertrude Carew, daughter of Sir John Carew, 3rd Baronet of Anthony, Cornwall.

Copley was returned as MP for Thirsk at the 1695 English general election and took an interest in matters of money and coinage. He was appointed Commissioner for taking subscriptions to the land bank in 1696. He opposed the attainer against Sir John Fenwick. He turned his attention to local matters and was given leave to bring in a bill for making the River Don navigable on 30 December 1697, but the bill was disrupted and thrown out. He was returned again as MP for Thirsk at the 1698 English general election and was immediately involved in issues relating to the army and the disbanding of soldiers. He was appointed a Commissioner for the Aire and Calder navigation in 1699.

Copley was returned to Parliament again at the two general elections of 1701 and was among those who supported the motion of 26 February 1702 which vindicated the proceedings of the Commons on the impeachments of the King&#x27;s ministers in the previous Parliament. His long term interest in public finance came to fruition when he was elected as commissioner of public accounts in 1702. He was returned again at the 1702 English general election and was appointed controller of the accounts of the army from April 1704. At the 1705 English general election, he was returned for Thirsk again and voted for the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705. He was returned again for Thirsk at the 1708 British general election and was appointed to draft the bill to standardize the treason laws within the Union in January 1709, and to prohibit the importation of French wine and other goods more effectively in March 1709.

==Death and legacy==

Copley died at his house in Westminster on 9 April 1709 after a few days&#x27; sickness, and was buried at Sprotbrough. He had one surviving daughter Catherine by his first wife, but with no male heir the baronetcy became extinct. The estates were left to a distant cousin Lionel Copley after whom they passed in 1766 to Copley&#x27;s grandson Joseph Moyle, son of his daughter Catherine and her husband Joseph Moyle of Beke, Cornwall. Moyle junior, who was Clerk of the Signet, changed his surname to Copley by Act of Parliament on inheriting the Sprotbrough estate and was created a baronet in 1778.

Copley is noted for making a bequest of £100 to the Royal Society in London in 1709, which provided the funding for an annual award, the Copley Medal, the Society&#x27;s premier award for scientific achievement. It is Britain&#x27;s oldest scientific honour, a prestigious forerunner of the Nobel Prize, &quot;in trust for the Royal Society of London for improving natural knowledge.&quot;

<doc id="407915" wikidata="Q9588290" url="?curid=407915" title="Longboat">
<text>A longboat is a type of ship&#x27;s boat that was in use from &quot;circa&quot; 1500 or before. Though the Royal Navy replaced longboats with launches from 1780, examples can be found in merchant ships after that date. The longboat was usually the largest boat carried. In the early period of use, a ship&#x27;s longboat was often so large that it could not be carried on board, and was instead towed. For instance, a 1618 survey of Royal Navy ship&#x27;s boats listed a longboat used by the First Rate &quot;Prince&quot;, a ship whose length of keel was . This could lead to the longboat being lost in adverse weather. By the middle of the 17th century it became increasingly more common to carry the longboat on board, though not universally. In 1697 some British ships chasing a French squadron cut adrift the longboats they were towing in an attempt to increase their speed and engage with the enemy.

The longboat was used for transporting heavy weights. The two most important of these were casks of drinking water, and an anchor and its cable. The supply of water to (particularly) sailing ships was so vital that all the boats of a ship would have some capability to carry water, but the longboat had the greatest capacity. The casks carried by a large boat would be &quot;leaguers&quot;, which held . These would be laid in the bilges between the thwarts, filling most of the bottom of the boat and making a load of several tonnes. Anchor handling was of special importance before tugs became widely available. A boat would be used to carry either a stream anchor or a kedge into position so that the ship may be pulled out of harbour or away from a hazard. As well as dropping the anchor in position, the longboat would often be used for weighing (raising) the anchor after use. To do this, a windlass was usually fitted amidships and a davit in the stern (or sometimes the bow) to provide a fair lead from the buoy rope or cable to the windlass. A substantial degree of buoyancy was needed in the stern (or bow) to lift a heavy anchor.

Other heavy weights carried by a longboat included guns - either as armament for the boat or simply to transport to or from the ship. Special slides were developed for armed boats, so that the gun could be traversed. These would also allow the gun to be slid down into a lower position when not in use, to improve the stability of the boat. Boats were regularly armed, even if only for defensive purposes. Swivel guns were sometimes used to protect the boat when collecting drinking water. Ship&#x27;s boats were often used offensively, either on their own or when their parent ships were in action.

The longboat usually had the largest passenger carrying capacity out of a ship&#x27;s boats. Longboats were used by both warships and merchant ships.

A longboat was fitted so that it could be propelled either by oars or by sail. The oars were double-banked - with two oarsmen on each thwart, each using an oar on their own side. The usual sailing rig was single masted, with a gaff mainsail and two headsails - the jib was set on a bowsprit and the staysail to the stemhead. This is a cutter rig, not to be confused with the ship&#x27;s boat termed a cutter.

A ship would usually carry the largest longboat it could store on deck. Consequently their size varied depending on the size of the parent ship. However, too large a boat could interfere with the handling of a ship or her guns, and the weight of a longboat could put excessive strain on the masts and yards which were used for hoisting the boat in and out of the water. Smaller ships might carry a yawl instead of a longboat. The sizes of longboats in the Royal Navy in circa 1705 were recorded in a shipwright&#x27;s notebook as follows.

The Royal Navy started to replace longboats with launches from November 1780. This instruction was implemented for all ships of 20 guns and above being built or coming in for repair. There are earlier instances of individual warships requesting a launch instead of a longboat, with several examples in the 1740s. The advantages of a launch were ease of use in carrying water and stores and a greater number of passengers being accommodated. However a longboat was considered to be more seaworthy. Longboats could be found in merchant service after the Royal Navy had ceased to use them.

<doc id="407916" wikidata="Q1185701" url="?curid=407916" title="Kogal">
<text>In Japanese culture, refers to the members of the Gyaru subculture who are still in high school and who incorporate their school uniforms into their dress style. These high school girls are characterized by the typical bleached hair, make-up, shortened skirts, and wearing of loose socks. The word &quot;kogal&quot; is anglicized from , a contraction of (&quot;high school gal&quot;). 

Aside from the miniskirt or microskirt, and the loose socks, kogals favor platform boots, makeup, and Burberry check scarves, and accessories considered &quot;kawaii&quot; or cute on bags and phones. They may also dye their hair brown and get artificial suntans. They have a distinctive slang peppered with English words. They are often, but not necessarily, enrolled students. Centers of kogal culture include the Harajuku and Shibuya districts of Tokyo, in particular Shibuya&#x27;s 109 Building. Pop singer Namie Amuro promoted the style. Kogals are avid users of photo booths, with most visiting at least once a week, according to non-scientific polls.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;kogal&quot; is a contraction of . It originated as a code used by disco bouncers to distinguish adults from minors. The term is not used by the girls it refers to. They call themselves , a Japanese pronunciation of the English word &quot;gal&quot;. The term was first popularized in 1972 by a television ad for a brand of jeans. In the 1980s, a was a fashionably dressed woman. When written , means &quot;young woman,&quot; so is sometimes understood in the sense of &quot;young gal&quot;.

==Character==
Kogals have been accused of conspicuous consumption, living off their parents and (amateur prostitution/dating service). It is unclear how many girls were actually involved in prostitution. Critics decry their materialism as reflecting a larger psychological or spiritual emptiness in modern Japanese life. Some kogals support their lifestyle with allowances from wealthy parents, living a &quot;parasite single&quot; existence that grates against traditional principles of duty and industry. Though brand-name accessories are part of the kogal look, many kogal may buy these cheaply as knock-off versions of a high-brand item from stalls in back-alley markets like Harajuku. Some feminists &quot;saw the young women as cleverly negotiating their own position in a male patriarchal world.&quot;

Others have charged that the kogal phenomenon is less about the girls and their fashions than a media practice to fetishize school uniforms and blame those required to wear them. &quot;I wish that I were in high school at a different time,&quot; said one schoolgirl. &quot;Now, with kogal being such an issue in Japan, nobody can see me for me. They only see me as kogal, like the ones they see on TV.&quot; Others state the kogal look was used alongside the &quot;enjo kōsai&quot; panic of the 1990s. A former editor of &quot;egg&quot; magazine, a gyaru fashion magazine, said &quot;enjo kōsai began as a mischievous but relatively innocent way of playing pranks on middle-aged men.&quot; This included exchanged small amounts of money for dates that lasted a few minutes. It was reported that the media coverage was framed as if all high school girls &quot;were rushing to Shibuya and having sex with men in karaoke boxes just to buy luxury goods.&quot; Years later, it was debunked as a stereotype. 

The kogal phenomenon has never represented a majority of teenage girls. Rather, it largely symbolizes the evolution of the role of women in capitalist Japan. As such, the kogal style rejects not only tradition which Japan is known for but the spirit of nationalism, seeking to embody stateless consumerism. This consumerism is communicated through knock-off designer goods, trips to photo booths, singing karaoke, partying, the use of love hotels, and incorporating new loanwords into everyday speech. Kogals also take a transactional approach to sexual activity, employing more risque language or referring openly to sex. Kogal hedonism and impolite language serve to assert self-hood of young Japanese women. Kogals&#x27; expertise in criticizing men, particularly older men, demonstrates their revolt against traditional gender norms. Kogal publications like &quot;Egg&quot;″s artwork gallery of male anatomy show that kogal culture can also empower young women to express displeasure and value their own pleasure. Overall, kogal language, behavior, and images reflect an urge to usurp an orderly society.

==History==
Japanese fashion began to divide by age in the 1970s with the appearance of magazines aimed at teens. &quot;Popteen&quot;, the most widely read of these magazines, has been publishing monthly since 1980. While mainstream fashion in the 1980s and early 1990s emphasized girlish and cute (kawaii), publications promoted a sexy aesthetic. Top magazines, including &quot;Popteen&quot;, &quot;Street Jam&quot; and &quot;Happie Nuts&quot;, were produced by editors previously involved in creating pornography for men.

Also in the 1980s, a male-and-female motorcycle-oriented slacker culture emerged in the form of the &quot;Yankiis&quot; (from the American word &quot;Yankee&quot;) and Bosozoku Gals. The original kogals were dropouts from private school who, instead of lengthening their skirts like androgynous Yankii girls, created a new form of teen rebellion by shortening them. These middle school dropouts were thus taking their cues from high school students and attempting to justify their independence by looking and acting older. The gals added their own touches like loose socks and a cellular phone.

The 1993 television special (&quot;The Kogal Night&quot;) introduced the kogal to a mass audience and provided a model for aspiring kogals to follow. Platform shoes were popularized by singer Namie Amuro in 1994. &quot;Egg&quot;, a fashion magazine for kogals, was established in 1995.

In the mid-1990s, the Japanese media gave a great deal of attention to the phenomenon of (&quot;paid dating&quot;) supposedly engaged in by bored housewives and high school students, thus linking kogals to prostitutes. The movie (&quot;Bounce Ko Gals&quot;) (1997) by Masato Harada depicts kogals prostituting themselves to buy trendy fashion accessories.

Kogal culture peaked in 1998. Kogals were then displaced by another style that gained popularity through &quot;Egg&quot;: , a gal culture that first appeared in the mid-1990s and used dark makeup combined with heavy amounts of tanning. evolved into another extreme look (though less extreme than ) called (&quot;mountain hag&quot;). As looks grew more extreme, fewer girls were attracted to gal culture. Although there are still female students who sexualize their uniforms, the kogal is no longer a focus of fashion or media attention.

Gal fashion later reemerged in the form of the skin-whitening , associated with &quot;Popteen&quot;. One such example of this is the Gal, who take their fashion cues from Hollywood. Clad in stilettos and jewels, these gals parade the streets of Shibuya. The women opting for this style are often gals of previous generations that are returning for this style, which is sexy yet more adult. Unlike their younger counterparts, there is less clubbing and more projecting an image of sky-high social status. Despite this, the Gals are more serious about their lives than other gal groups, with their age placing them in college or the workforce. One of the driving forces behind this is Sifow, a singer and idol that subscribes to the Gal style.

The &quot;Hime gyaru&quot; (literally &quot;lady gal,&quot; also translated as &quot;princess gal&quot;), also part of the style, first appeared in 2007. The girls in this subculture seem to want to live as princesses like out of fairy tales, complete with over-glamorous lifestyles and items. They wear princess-like dresses (usually in pink or other pastels), and sport large, curly brown hair, usually in bouffants. Popular brands for this subsection of Gal include Liz Lisa and Jesus Diamante.

The waves of changing female Japanese beauty culture such as the kogal represent a growing diversity in female beauty which contrasts with the focus on docility and cuteness perpetuated previously. Kogal and its predecessors visually chronicle the evolution of Japan into a consumer culture, visibly displaying the changing values and norms within Japanese culture as consumerism necessitates the displacement of the identity to surface features.

==Language==
Kogals are identified primarily by looks, but their speech, called , is also distinctive, including, but not restricted to the following: , , , , , , . As a way to celebrate their individuality, gals might say .

Gals&#x27; words are often created by contracting Japanese phrases or by literal translation of an English phrase, i.e. without reordering to follow Japanese syntax. Gal words may also be created by adding the suffix (from English &quot;-ing&quot;) to verbs, for example . Roman script abbreviations are popular, for example &quot;MM&quot; stands for (&quot;really frustrating&quot;). &quot;MK5&quot; stands for . Another feature of gal speech is the suffix , meaning &quot;like&quot; or &quot;learned from,&quot; as in .

The English used in kogal speech is often a combination of two or more English words which have taken on new meaning in Japan.

<doc id="407918" wikidata="Q1397303" url="?curid=407918" title="Trent Franks">
<text>Harold Trent Franks (born June 19, 1957) is an American businessman and former politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2003 to 2017 (numbered as the 2nd district from 2003 to 2013). He is a member of the Republican Party. During his tenure, Franks served as vice chairman of the United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces and chairman of the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

In December 2017, the House Ethics Committee announced that it would investigate allegations of sexual harassment against Franks. Franks had repeatedly asked two female staffers to bear his children as surrogate mothers, and allegedly offered one of them $5 million to carry his child and retaliated against her when she declined. The women feared that Franks wanted to impregnate them sexually as part of the surrogacy process. Franks acknowledged discussing surrogacy with the aides but denied the other allegations; he resigned from Congress immediately after the ethics investigation was announced, blaming his situation on &quot;the current cultural and media climate&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Franks was born in Uravan, Colorado, a uranium mining company town which became a ghost town. Franks is the son of Juanita and Edward Taylor Franks. He was born with a cleft lip and palate. After his parents separated, Franks took care of his younger siblings. Franks graduated from Briggsdale High School in Colorado in 1976.

In 1987, he completed a course of study at the non-accredited Utah&#x27;s National Center for Constitutional Studies, formerly known as the Freemen Institute. For one year, from 1989 to 1990, he attended the Arizona campus of Ottawa University.

== Early career ==
After high school, Franks bought a drilling rig and moved to Texas to drill wells with his best friend and his younger brother. He moved to Arizona in 1981, where he continued to drill wells.

=== Arizona House of Representatives ===
In 1984, while working as an engineer for an oil and gas royalty-purchasing firm, Franks began his political career by running in a heavily Democratic district for a seat in the Arizona House of Representatives, against incumbent Democrat Glenn Davis. Franks campaigned on a conservative &quot;Reagan Republican&quot; platform emphasizing stronger child protection laws as well as the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. He narrowly won the election by 155 votes amid that year&#x27;s massive national Republican wave. In the state legislature, Franks served as Vice-Chairman of the Commerce Committee and Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Child Protection and Family Preservation.

In November 1988, Franks ran again for a legislative seat, moving to District 18 shortly before the filing deadline. He lost that election.

=== Arizona governor&#x27;s cabinet ===
In January 1987, he was appointed by Republican Governor Evan Mecham to head the Arizona Governor&#x27;s Office for Children, a cabinet-level division of the governor&#x27;s office responsible for overseeing and coordinating state policy and programs for Arizona&#x27;s children.

Franks then founded the Arizona Family Research Institute, a nonprofit organization affiliated with Focus on the Family. He was the executive director of the organization for four and a half years. He was successful in the Republican primary but lost in the November general election.

===Political activism===
In 1992, when Franks was chairman of Arizonans for Common Sense, one of the organization&#x27;s efforts was a constitutional amendment on the November 1992 ballot to &quot;protect most preborn children in Arizona from abortion on demand&quot;. The initiative lost, getting about 35 percent of the votes cast.

In August 1995, Arizonans for an Empowered Future, of which Franks was chairman, launched an initiative campaign to amend the state constitution, replacing the graduated state income tax with a flat 3.5 percent rate, and allowing parents to deduct the costs of private school tuition. That effort was also unsuccessful. Later that year, Franks, became the original author and leading proponent of the successful passage of the Tuition Tax Credit Bill in Arizona. The initiative was not one of those appearing on the ballot in 1996.

In 1997, Trent Franks, along with his brother, Lane Franks, founded Liberty Petroleum Corporation, a petroleum exploration company. That year, Franks also worked as a consultant and surrogate speaker for conservative activist Pat Buchanan&#x27;s presidential campaign.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
==== 1994 ====

Franks ran for in 1994, after incumbent U.S. Representative Jon Kyl decided to run for the U.S. Senate. He lost to John Shadegg, 43–30%.

==== 2002 ====

Following the 2000 census, Arizona got two additional seats. Franks&#x27; home in Glendale was drawn into the 2nd district. That district had previously been the 3rd District, represented by 13-term incumbent Republican Bob Stump, who was not running for reelection. The initial favorite in the race was Lisa Jackson Atkins, Stump&#x27;s longtime chief of staff, whom Stump had endorsed as his successor. Atkins had long been very visible in the district (in contrast to her more low-key boss) to the point that many thought she was the district&#x27;s representative. Franks narrowly defeated Atkins in the seven-candidate Republican primary, 28–26%, a difference of just 797 votes. He won the November 2002 general election, defeating Democrat Randy Camacho, 60–37%.

==== 2004 ====

Franks faced competition in the Republican primary from the more moderate businessman Rick Murphy. Franks defeated him 64–36%. He won re-election to a second term, by defeating Camacho in a rematch, 59–38%.

==== 2006 ====

He won re-election to a third term with 59% of the vote.

==== 2008 ====

He won re-election to a fourth term with 59% of the vote.

==== 2010 ====

Franks was again challenged in the Republican primary. However, he easily defeated Charles Black, 81–19%. He won re-election to a fifth term with 65% of the vote.

==== 2012 ====

For his first five terms, Franks represented a vast district encompassing most of northwestern Arizona from the West Valley to the California border, including Lake Havasu City and the Grand Canyon. While the district appeared rural, the bulk of its population was in the West Valley, which had dominated the district since it was drawn into what was then the 3rd in 1967. The district appeared to be gerrymandered because of a narrow tendril connecting the Hopi reservation to the rest of the district. However, due to longstanding disputes between the Hopi and Navajo, it had long been believed the two tribes should be in separate districts.

However, after the 2010 census and redistricting, Franks&#x27; district was renumbered as the 8th District, and reduced to essentially the Maricopa County portion of the old 2nd. It included most of Glendale, as well as all of Sun City and Surprise, almost all of Peoria, and much of western Phoenix. As evidence of how much the West Valley had dominated the district, Franks retained 92 percent of his former constituents, even as he lost 85 percent of his old district&#x27;s land. He was challenged in the Republican primary by Tony Passalacqua, whom Franks defeated easily, 83–17%. The new 8th was no less Republican than the old 2nd, and Franks won a sixth term with 63% of the vote.

==== 2014 ====
Franks won his party&#x27;s election in the Republican primary on August 26, 2014. Facing no Democratic opponent in the general election, Franks won re-election with over 75% of the vote over Stephen Dolgos, the Americans Elect candidate.

==== 2016 ====

Franks faced a Republican primary challenge from Clair Van Steenwyck, but won renomination with over 71% of the vote. He again faced no Democratic opponent in the general election, and defeated Arizona Green Party nominee Mark Salazar 68.5%–31.5%.

==== 2024 ====

After his resignation, Franks was succeeded by fellow Republican Debbie Lesko in a special election. Lesko would retire ahead of the 2024 election, leaving the seat open. On November 1, 2023, Franks announced he would run in the Republican primary to regain his old seat. He finished in fourth place, and the primary was won by Abraham Hamadeh.

===Political positions===
In 2009, &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked Franks among the &quot;most conservative&quot; members of the U.S. House of Representatives. He was a member of the Republican Study Committee.

====Online gaming====
In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

====Homeland security====
On October 14, 2009, Franks joined with three other members of Congress in calling for the investigation of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) over allegations of trying to plant &quot;spies&quot; based on a CAIR memo indicating that the group planned to &quot;develop national initiatives such as Lobby day&quot; and place &quot;Muslim interns in Congressional offices.&quot; The request followed the publication of the book &quot;Muslim Mafia&quot;. Representative Sue Myrick had written the foreword, which characterized CAIR as subversive and aligned with terrorists. CAIR countered that these initiatives are extensively used by all advocacy groups and accused Franks and his colleagues of intending to intimidate American Muslims who &quot;take part in the political process and exercise their rights.&quot;

====Taxes====
Franks signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. In 2010, Franks voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He received high approval ratings from the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council. In November 2011, he voted to pass H.R. 2930, which authorizes crowdfunding for small businesses.

In 2009, Franks signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.

====Criticism of the Obama administration====
He opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, saying &quot;the thought of Americans&#x27; health care decisions being put into the hands of an unimaginably large bureaucracy is a frightening prospect.&quot; He was not supported by American Public Health Association or the Children&#x27;s Health Fund.

In September 2009, he called President Barack Obama an &quot;enemy of humanity&quot; with his spokesperson later clarifying the remarks were in response to Obama&#x27;s position on abortion.

&quot;A president that has lost his way that badly, that has no ability to see the image of God in these little fellow human beings, if he can&#x27;t do that right, then he has no place in any station of government and we need to realize that he is an enemy of humanity,&quot; Franks said to the &quot;How to Take Back America&quot; conference.

====Abortion====
In a 2010 interview, discussing the legacy of slavery which Franks described as a &quot;crushing mark on America&#x27;s soul&quot;, the congressman said, &quot;Half of all black children are aborted. Far more of the African American community is being devastated by the policies of today than were being devastated by the policies of slavery.&quot;

In June 2013, he proposed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks, without exceptions for rape and incest. He stirred controversy when saying that &quot;the incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.&quot; He later clarified, &quot;Pregnancies from rape that result in abortion after the beginning of the sixth month are very rare.&quot; The bill passed by a vote of 228–196.

In 2017, he again proposed the same bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks without exceptions for rape and incest. The bill passed by a vote of 237–189.

Franks presided over a hearing to ban abortions after 20 weeks in the District of Columbia, in which he did not allow D.C.&#x27;s lone delegate and Member of Congress, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, to testify. In doing so, he said Congress has the authority to &quot;exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever&quot; in the District, even though the heavily Democratic district is strongly opposed to the ban.

Franks has also been involved in the founding of a crisis pregnancy center in Tempe, Arizona. In the past, Franks has picketed abortion clinics but has ceased to do so stating in a June 2013 interview that &quot;It became clear to me that I could be more effective by trying to do something to light a candle rather than curse the darkness.&quot;

====Other====

During the 2008 campaign, Franks stated that he is skeptical about global warming and other commonly accepted theories supported by the scientific community. Franks is a past chairman of the Children&#x27;s Hope Scholarship Foundation.

He opposes same-sex marriage.

Franks opposes gun control. The interest group Gun Owners of America has given Franks high approval ratings. In 2011, he voted to pass the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act. Franks has also been active with Operation Smile.

====Sexual harassment scandal and resignation====
In December 2017, two of Franks&#x27; former aides accused him of sexually harassing them by pushing them to serve as surrogate mothers for his wife. In response, the House Ethics Committee announced that it would investigate allegations of sexual harassment against Franks.

On December 7, 2017—hours after the ethics investigation became public—Franks announced he would resign from the House on January 31, 2018. In a statement, Franks acknowledged discussing surrogacy with the aides and acknowledged that he inadvertently discussed it in a manner that was &quot;insensitive,&quot; and regretted &quot;having caused distress&quot; to his former aides. While he denied the other allegations, he stated that &quot;the current cultural and media climate&quot; made a fair hearing impossible, and was resigning to prevent harm to &quot;those things I love most.&quot; The following day, after his wife was admitted to the hospital, Franks announced his immediate resignation.

It later emerged that one of the aides&#x27; friends advised the aide to seek counsel from Traditional Values Coalition president Andrea Lafferty. When the aide was ready to come forward, Lafferty arranged a meeting with staffers from House Speaker Paul Ryan&#x27;s office. Lafferty told CNN that she was outraged that &quot;somebody who purports to be a conservative and a Christian&quot; could behave in the manner that Franks allegedly behaved. According to a statement from Ryan, his general counsel interviewed the ex-aide on November 28, during which she mentioned the second aide&#x27;s claims of misconduct. After Ryan&#x27;s staff was able to corroborate the second aide&#x27;s claims, Ryan was briefed on November 29. On November 30, Ryan called Franks in and confronted him with the allegations. After Franks &quot;did not deny&quot; the allegations, Ryan referred the matter to the Ethics Committee and demanded Franks&#x27; resignation. Subsequent talks between Ryan and Franks led to Franks tendering his resignation on December 7. In his statement, Ryan said that he found the aides&#x27; claims &quot;credible,&quot; and acted in accordance with his duty to ensure &quot;a safe workplace in the House.&quot;

===Legislation sponsored===
* Congressman Franks sponsored into law The Critical Infrastructure Protection Act to protect America&#x27;s critical infrastructure including protecting the electric grid against natural and weaponized electromagnetic pulse (EMP).
* On April 9, 2013, Franks introduced the Keep the Promise Act of 2013 (H.R. 1410; 113th Congress). If enacted, the bill would prevent the Arizona Native American tribe Tohono O&#x27;odham from building a planned casino in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The Keep the Promise Act of 2013 would prohibit Class II and III gaming on land within the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area that is acquired after April 9, 2013, by the Secretary of the Interior in trust for the benefit of an Indian tribe. The bill would terminate that prohibition on January 1, 2027.

Opponents of the bill gave several reasons for their opposition. Representative Tom McClintock (R-CA) was opposed to the bill because it would hurt job creation and break a promise to the Tohono O&#x27;odham tribe. Tohono O’odham Nation Chairman Ned Norris Jr. objected to the bill because it is &quot;special interest legislation&quot; that creates a &quot;no-competition zone&quot; for the two tribes that already have casinos in that area.

Proponents of the bill included Gila River Indian Community Gov. Gregory Mendoza, who was in favor of the bill because he believes that the compact not to build more casinos needs to be respected. The Tohono O’odham Nation argues that federal rules allow casinos on reservation land created after October 17, 1988, if they are part of a settlement of a land claim. The Nation claims the West Valley land is partial replacement to settle a claim for the of its lands that were flooded as a result of the construction of the Painted Rock Dam on the Gila River.
* On July 14, 2017, Franks introduced Amendment No. 13 to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018. The amendment called for a database surveying American Muslim leaders to identify violent and &quot;unorthodox&quot; strains of Islam. Critics of the amendment, including, most notably, Minnesota Democratic congressman Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, repudiated the amendment as an attempt to subject one religion to special scrutiny. Ultimately, the amendment was defeated 217–208, with 27 House Republicans joining all the House Democrats in voting in opposition.

Ultimately, the amendment was defeated 217–208, with 27 House Republicans joining all the House Democrats in voting in opposition. 
* in Congress, Franks was a chief opponent of abortion. He was the original sponsor of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which began in 2017 on his initiative and then continued in 2019 thanks to Senator Ben Sasse; The Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act; and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. All three bills passed the U.S. House of Representatives with the latter becoming the first bill in history to pass either chamber of Congress affording affirmative protection to a fetus.

<doc id="407919" wikidata="Q947145" url="?curid=407919" title="Rick Renzi">
<text>Richard George Renzi (born June 11, 1958) is an American politician who was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives representing from 2003 until 2009.

In 2013, he was convicted on federal criminal charges against him for his involvement in a land-swap deal. The charges for personal gain of over $700,000 were filed in 2008. On April 19, 2007, the FBI raided his family business, and he temporarily resigned from the House Intelligence Committee. On April 27, Renzi denied printed claims he was considering resigning office; however, on August 23, Renzi announced he would not be a candidate for re-election in 2008. On February 22, 2008, Renzi was indicted on 35 counts connected to land deals. He pleaded not guilty. On June 12, 2013, Renzi was convicted on 17 of 32 counts in his corruption case. On October 28, 2013, he was sentenced to three years in prison.

After numerous examples of Prosecutorial Misconduct, by the team led by Jack Smith (lawyer), came to light in a 119-page Inspector General complaint, Renzi was pardoned by President Donald Trump on January 20, 2021.

==Early life, education==
Renzi is one of five siblings born into an Italian-American family in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. He attended high school in Annandale, Virginia, before moving to Sierra Vista, Arizona, in 1975, where his father, U.S. Army Major General Eugene Carmen Renzi (d. 2008), served at Fort Huachuca. Renzi graduated from Buena High School and attended Northern Arizona University (NAU), earning a B.S. in criminal justice in 1980. He played football for NAU and was a starting offensive lineman.

===Family===
Renzi and his wife, Roberta S. Renzi, are the parents of 12 children. Like Renzi&#x27;s siblings, his children all have forenames that begin with the letter &quot;R&quot;.

== Career prior to Congress ==

Where Renzi lived and what he did throughout the 1986–1997 period is unclear. In a letter to the &quot;Arizona Daily Sun&quot; in July 2002, Renzi said &quot;The only time I have not lived in Arizona is when I served our nation overseas on a Defense Department program, or when I entered law school at age 39&quot; [which would be 1997 or 1998].

However, according to an August 2002 &quot;Associated Press&quot; article, Renzi said that between college, starting in the late 1970s, and his return some 20 years later, he had lived in Flagstaff for only a total of seven years. The AP article also said &quot;Renzi made much of his money while living in Burke, Virginia, about 20 minutes from downtown Washington. He has owned a $765,000 two-story, six-bedroom home on five acres there since 1991, according to Fairfax County, Virginia, property records.&quot;

In 1989, Renzi started Renzi &amp; Company (now called the Patriot Insurance Agency), a company that offers insurance to nonprofit organizations such as crisis pregnancy centers, pregnancy care clinics, maternity homes, PTAs, PTOs, and local service organizations. In 2006, Renzi said that he decided to enter politics because of his experiences as a member of National Association of Professional Insurance Agents. Renzi was a property/casualty agent and a member of PIA of Virginia &amp; D.C. He said his first taste of the political process was attending a PIA Federal Legislative Summit. &quot;I had a chance to interact with a lot of the congressmen and Senators, and I fell in love with it&quot;, Renzi said.

In 1997 or 1998, Renzi began to take law courses at The Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. He finished his coursework in December 2001 and graduated with a J.D. in 2002. While he was studying law, he claimed he was an unpaid intern in Senator Jon Kyl&#x27;s office for two months in 1999, and in 2001 he spent several months as an unpaid intern for Representative Jim Kolbe. Senator Kyl later questioned the accuracy of Renzi&#x27;s description of his work in Kyl&#x27;s office, saying he was never employed there.

==U.S. House of Representatives==


=== Move to Arizona ===
Renzi moved his official residence from Virginia to Arizona in 1999, registering to vote in Santa Cruz County. In 2001, he bought a $216,000 home in Flagstaff, moving his voting registration there in December of that year.

In 2002, Renzi acknowledged that he returned to Arizona with the intention of running for Congress, but defended his state ties. He noted that between college and his return to Arizona, he lived in Flagstaff for a total of seven years. There is proof Renzi was living in Arizona after college because, Renzi and his wife did have several children who were born in Sierra Vista, AZ. Renzi also said he owned more than in northern Arizona through a real estate development and improvement business, in addition to a small vineyard and ranch in Sonoita, Arizona, west of Sierra Vista, in the 8th congressional district, and a home in Kingman. During the campaign, Renzi said &quot;Let the chips fall where they may if I&#x27;m a carpetbagger.&quot;

=== 2002 election ===

====Primary election====
Renzi won a hotly contested Republican primary election against five other candidates; his closest opponents were Lewis Noble Tenney, a former Navajo County supervisor, and conservative radio personality Sydney Ann Hay of Munds Park. Renzi outspent his primary opponents by a substantial sum of money. He invested $585,000 of his own money and raised another $100,000 to run radio and TV ads throughout the district. Renzi received 24.4 percent of the 46,585 votes cast in the Republican primary, with half of his votes coming from Yavapai County.

The 2002 Democratic primary, also hotly contested, was narrowly won by George Cordova, a party outsider who ran against several better-known candidates, including Stephen Udall, Diane Prescott and Fred Duval. (There was no incumbent for the seat, in a new district created after the 2000 census gave the state two more Representatives.)

====General election====
Renzi received significant support from the national Republican party in the race: President Bush visited twice, including a fundraiser; Vice President Cheney appeared at a fund-raising luncheon; Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton visited the district to support Renzi; and so did Mel Martinez, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The campaign included the heavy use of negative advertising attacking Cordova, including accusing him of cheating investors out of $1 million in a failed business venture, failing to pay income and business taxes, and living in California. Cordova denied the charges but had no funds to buy many television ads to refute them. The Renzi campaign also made heavy use of automated telephone calls throughout the district with various claims and innuendos about Cordova. Renzi said of the $2 million spent on negative ads, that he &quot;took no joy in any of that.&quot; Renzi said he had tried to tell the National Republican Congressional Committee that the negative ads were the wrong way to go.

During the 2002 election campaign, Renzi proposed that Walnut Canyon National Monument in Northern Arizona be renamed the &quot;National Park of the American Flag&quot; with the addition an American flag theme to the park, including displays of U.S. flags throughout history. This was in response to proposals by local citizens that Walnut Canyon National Monument be expanded and given National Park status. Renzi&#x27;s proposal was widely ridiculed, and he has not promoted it since.

On election day, Renzi defeated Cordova by 49 percent to 46 percent, a difference of about 6,000 votes.

==== Campaign finances ====
Renzi spent $436,590 of his own money on the election. In addition to large donations from his father&#x27;s defense company, Mantech International, Mantech executives were the largest single source of outside money for the campaign.

In 2004, the Federal Election Commission completed an audit of Renzi&#x27;s campaign committee, &quot;Rick Renzi for Congress.&quot; The audit found that Renzi&#x27;s campaign overstated its cash on hand by about $64,000, and that employers or occupations for 200 contributors were not listed, though required by law. The FEC also concluded that the committee had illegally financed much of the campaign with $369,090 of loans that came from &quot;impermissible&quot; corporate funds. Most of those loans were part of the $436,000 that Renzi put into his own campaign. Renzi was fined $1,000 in November 2005 by the FEC for underreported receipts stemming from what his campaign called a software glitch. During the summer before the 2006 election, the FEC dropped all charges related to the 2002 alleged use of impermissible corporate funds for his campaign.

===2004 re-election===
In preparation for the 2004 campaign, the Democratic Party in Arizona tapped Paul Babbitt, Coconino County commissioner and the brother of Bruce Babbitt, to run for the seat and pressured all other candidates with the exception of political unknown Bob Donahue to bow out of the primary in order to clear the way for Babbitt to run against Renzi without a costly primary contest. Paul Babbitt&#x27;s campaign was named a top national priority by most major Democratic fundraisers and liberal weblogs, because a plurality of Arizona 1st Congressional District voters are registered Democrats and because Renzi won so narrowly in 2002. Unlike the Cordova campaign in 2002, which received only token support from the national Democratic Party organizations, the Babbitt campaign received major support; nonetheless, it was unable to match Renzi&#x27;s fundraising.

===2006 re-election===
Renzi faced no opposition from his own party in the Republican primary. Five Democratic Party candidates, including Bob Donahue, Mike Caccioppoli, Susan Friedman, Ellen Simon, and Vic McKerlie, ran in the 2006 primary in September, which was won by Ellen Simon, an attorney and community activist. David Schlosser was also in the November general election on the Libertarian Party ticket.

Renzi won his re-election against Simon, 52% to 43%.

On August 23, 2007, Renzi announced he would not seek another term.

===Issues and positions===

In 2002, in response to a question about spiraling health care costs, Renzi said &quot;In order to keep health insurance costs competitive, we must allow the self-employed to take annual tax deductions for their health-care costs. We must change the health insurance industry by allowing employees to purchase their own health-care policy. This would allow for personal ownership of health-care policies, which would provide portability, more choice and thus more competition, which leads to lower health-care premiums.&quot;

Renzi was named one of the American Legion&#x27;s &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot; of the 108th Congress. American Legion National Commander John Brieden noted that &quot;The 108th Congress passed a record increase in Department of Veterans Affairs health care funding for the current fiscal year, and it reduced the number of service-disabled military retirees subject to a &#x27;disability tax&#x27; on their retired pay.&quot; Brieden said &quot;I commend Representative Renzi for taking a leadership role in making that happen.&quot;

In 2004, Renzi and Representative Jon Porter introduced legislation to split the Ninth Circuit court, currently the largest circuit in the U.S., which includes Arizona, into three smaller circuits. John Ensign of Nevada introduced similar legislation in the Senate.

Renzi was generally a supporter of expanded legal immigration into the United States and supported expansion of guest worker programs and the H1B visa. He did strongly support using technology to enforce border security.

In June 2006, the House accepted an amendment proposed by Renzi to increase tribal law enforcement funding by $5 million and decrease spending for international organizations such as the United Nations by the same amount.

On December 14, 2005, he voted for the reauthorization of the Patriot Act. On June 29, 2005, he voted for the increase of funds by $25 million for anti-marijuana print and TV ads.

== Controversies ==
In September 2006, Renzi was named one of the &quot;20 Most Corrupt Members of Congress&quot; in a report by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a non-partisan watchdog group founded in 2005 by former Democratic congressional staffers. Renzi was also listed in the first report by the organization in January 2006, when he was one of 13 named members. The organization said &quot;His ethics issues stem from the outside income earned by his administrative assistant and from legislation he sponsored that benefitted his father.&quot; He was subsequently listed in CREW&#x27;s 2007 and 2008 reports as well.

===ManTech International Corp.===
Renzi had been criticized for consistently introducing and voting in favor of bills benefiting his father&#x27;s defense company, ManTech International Corp., a Fairfax, Virginia,-based defense contractor. Renzi&#x27;s father, retired Major General Eugene Renzi, was an executive vice president of the firm, until his death in February 2008. ManTech had $467 million in contracts at the Army&#x27;s Fort Huachuca with options for an additional $1.1 billion between 2004 through 2008. In addition, the company, which has an office in Sierra Vista, Arizona, was the largest contributor to Renzi&#x27;s 2002 congressional campaign and the second largest in his 2004 campaign.

In 2003, Renzi sponsored legislation (signed into law in November 2003) that put hundreds of millions of dollars to Eugene&#x27;s business while, according to environmentalists, devastating the San Pedro River. The provision exempted Fort Huachuca, in Sierra Vista, Arizona, from maintaining water levels in the San Pedro River as called for in an agreement made in 2002 with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Renzi claimed he introduced the measure to prevent the closing of the Fort and to promote its enlargement. Neither the fort nor the river is located in Renzi&#x27;s Congressional district.

On October 25, 2006, just two weeks before Election Day, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that federal authorities had opened an inquiry into the case. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, the &quot;officials said the inquiry was at an early stage and that no search warrants had been issued, suggesting that investigators had yet to determine whether there was a basis to open a formal investigation or empanel a grand jury.&quot; Federal investigators in Arizona reported that unexplained delays were encountered in getting permission from Washington for investigations prior to the 2006 election.

On April 19, 2007, the FBI raided his family business, and he temporarily resigned from the House Intelligence Committee.

On February 22, 2008, Renzi was indicted on multiple federal charges as a result of the investigation.

===2005 land swap===
According to the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;, in 2002 Renzi sold off a half-interest in his real estate investment business to a fellow investor, James Sandlin, for $200,000. Renzi used the money for his 2002 congressional campaign. In 2003, Renzi sold the remainder of the business to Sandlin, for somewhere between $1 million and $5 million, according to financial records, retaining a &quot;future development interest&quot;.

In October 2005, three years after the business transaction with Sandlin, Renzi announced he&#x27;d be introducing a bill in Congress that would include a swap of land owned by Sandlin (not in Renzi&#x27;s district) for federal land near Florence, Arizona. A week after Renzi&#x27;s announcement, Sandlin sold his land for $4.5 million, a much higher price than he paid for it.

Renzi told the &quot;New Times&quot; that he did nothing wrong and that sometime after his announcement he recused himself from the bill after a lobbyist questioned his connection to Sandlin. The land swap never became law.

In 2007 news came of another $200,000 payment that Sandlin made to Renzi, this one in 2005, that Renzi failed to report on financial disclosure forms.

On October 24, 2006, the Associated Press reported that the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office in Arizona has opened an investigation into the land swap deal. The US Attorney for Arizona, Paul Charlton, had initiated the investigation in September 2006.

John Wilke in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; writes,

On February 22, 2008, a Federal Grand Jury in Arizona handed up a 35-count indictment charging Renzi with conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering extortion and insurance fraud.

===Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy===
After the land swap controversy was revealed, an unnamed official from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) cautioned the media not to jump to conclusions regarding the inquiry into Renzi, saying it &quot;is not a well-developed investigation, by any means. A tip comes into the department. The department is obligated to follow up ... and we do that. People are assuming there is evidence of some crime,&quot; even though that is not necessarily true. The official added, &quot;Be careful. I can confirm to you a very early investigation. But I want to caution you not to chop this guy&#x27;s (Renzi&#x27;s) head off.&quot;

According to the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;, &quot;The federal official would not discuss whether the Justice Department was being manipulated for political purposes. However, the official said it is unusual for the department to publicly acknowledge concerns about the accuracy of media reports.&quot; In the same story, the official said the Justice Department contacted at least two newspapers about &quot;chunks of stuff in their stories that&#x27;s wrong.&quot;

Shortly after initiating the investigation of Renzi, the US Attorney for Arizona, Paul Charlton, was belatedly added to a previously assembled list of US attorneys the Justice Department wanted to remove, in an effort that would become the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy. In February 2005, Charlton had been on the &quot;retain&quot; list of United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales&#x27;s chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, but &quot;by September of 2006 – after it became clear that Charlton had launched an investigation of Rep. Rick Renzi, R-Ariz, – Sampson included the Arizona prosecutor on another list of U.S. attorneys &#x27;we now should consider pushing out&#x27;.&quot; Sampson made the comment in a September 13, 2006, letter to then-White House Counsel Harriet Miers.

On March 19, 2007, the White House released 3,000 pages of records connected to the controversy, including emails sent by Charlton to the Justice Department about his dismissal. On December 21, 2006, Charlton sent a message to William W. Mercer, the third-ranking official in the DOJ, writing, &quot;Media now asking if I was asked to resign over leak in Congressman Renzi investigation.&quot; Charlton never received a response from Mercer, about whom ethical questions had also been raised.

The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; explained further allegations: that the DOJ under Gonzales had intentionally delayed part of the investigation of Renzi until after the November 2006 election. They wrote:
Further, the Journal noted that investigators had unsuccessfully solicited the administration for clearance to tap Renzi&#x27;s phone for months. That clearance was finally given nineteen months later, in October 2006. Unfortunately for the investigators, word broke of the investigation soon after, disrupting the usefulness of their wiretap.

On April 24, 2007, Renzi stepped down from the House Financial Services and Natural Resources committees, as more revelations connected him to the U.S. attorneys controversy. During that afternoon, Paul Charlton, a United States Attorney from Arizona who was inexplicably added to the list of those to be fired, related to House investigators that Brian Murray, Renzi&#x27;s top aide, called Charlton spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle shortly after news of Renzi&#x27;s investigation became public, making inquiries related to information on the case. Charlton, in turn, notified the Department of Justice about the call. Justice, it was discovered, had neglected to notify Congress of the contact.

=== Patty Roe ===
In December 2005, Renzi hired Patty Roe, the wife of Jason Roe, the chief of staff of Representative Tom Feeney (R-FL), as his full-time administrative assistant. In that position, she was paid $95,000 per year. Renzi also pays her $5,000 per month ($60,000 per year) as a fundraising consultant (she ran her own consulting business before being hired by Renzi). To be in compliance with the rules, Roe had to do all her fundraising work clocking in to work as Renzi&#x27;s administrative assistant, or after work. Renzi&#x27;s spokesman Vartan Djihanian said that this is the case: &quot;Whatever fundraising she does ... is on her time.&quot;

Roe also received about $30,000 in fundraising fees in 2006 from four other House members: Tom Feeney; Lincoln Díaz-Balart and Mario Díaz-Balart, both of Florida; and Patrick McHenry of North Carolina. Renzi&#x27;s office said those payments were for services rendered in 2005. There is no evidence that Roe&#x27;s activities are not in compliance with House ethics standards.

=== Reported floor fight ===
Renzi was an opponent of embryonic stem cell research. In May 2005, he engaged in an argument on the House floor with Congressman Mark Kirk (R-IL). The argument ensued after Renzi had learned that Kirk and the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership commissioned secret polling in the districts of Renzi and other members of Congress who oppose stem cell research. Renzi said, &quot;I was yelling at him. I told him it&#x27;s absolutely unprecedented that Republicans would pay for a push poll to attack another Republican on such a core belief of mine ... You&#x27;re not going to change my view on the issue, as a father of 12.&quot;

===Funds from DeLay&#x27;s PAC===
Renzi also received $30,000 in campaign contributions from former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay&#x27;s ARMPAC.

==Indictment, conviction and pardon==
On February 22, 2008, after &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; columnist Sarah Fenske broke a story about the 2002 campaign financing embezzlement, Renzi was indicted on multiple federal charges. The charges included conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering, extortion and insurance fraud. In October 2009, the government added a conspiracy to commit insurance fraud charge to the indictment. It alleged that Renzi and others willfully embezzled from a risk retention company called Spirit Mountain. In June 2010, Federal District Judge David C. Bury, ruled that procedural errors precluded the prosecution from using available wire-taps as evidence in the case going forward.

In 2011, Renzi appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking the court to stop his prosecution. A three-judge panel held that Renzi&#x27;s prosecution could go forward and the full court let pass a petition to rehear that decision en banc, allowing the case against Renzi to proceed. Renzi appealed to the Supreme Court but it also declined to hear his appeal so he was put on trial.

On June 12, 2013, a jury convicted Renzi on 17 of 32 counts in his corruption case. That October, Renzi was sentenced to three years in prison. Renzi appealed his conviction to the Ninth Circuit, but the court upheld the jury&#x27;s verdict. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari.

On February 27, 2015, Renzi reported to Federal Correctional Institution, Morgantown West Virginia, to serve his 3-year prison sentence. He was Bureau of Prisons inmate 29375-208 and was released on January 6, 2017.

On January 20, 2021, Renzi received a full pardon from President Donald Trump during his last hours as president. Citing numerous examples of prosecutorial misconduct, including fabricated evidence by the team led by Jack Smith (lawyer), the pardon was supported by Representative Paul Gosar, Representative Tom Cole, former Representative Tom DeLay, former Representative Jack Kingston, former Representative Todd Tiahrt, former Representative John Doolittle, former Representative Duncan L. Hunter, former Representative Richard Pombo, former Representative Charles H. Taylor, former Representative Dan Burton, Larry Weitzner, and the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates.

<text>John Barden Shadegg (; born October 22, 1949) is an American politician and former U.S. representative for , serving from 1995 until 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party.

The district, numbered as the 4th district before the 2000 census, included much of northern Phoenix.

==Early life, education and career==
Shadegg is the son of the former Eugenia Kerr and Stephen Shadegg, both deceased. The senior Shadegg, a conservative political consultant and public relations specialist, supported Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1952, 1958, 1968, 1974, and 1980 U.S. Senate campaigns and worked with F. Clifton White and Peter O&#x27;Donnell to organize the Draft Goldwater Committee in the 1963–64 presidential campaign.

The Shadeggs are of partial Swiss descent.

John Shadegg was born in Phoenix and received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Arizona at Tucson in 1972 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Arizona Law School, also in Tucson, in 1975. He served in the Arizona Air National Guard from 1969 to 1975.

In 1975, he went to work for the law firm of Treon, Warnicke, Dann and Roush. Shadegg. In 1982, Shadegg led the re-election campaign of Robert Corbin, for Arizona Attorney General. The election was challenged with claims that Corbin buried the prosecution looking into the murder of organized crime investigative reporter Don Bolles which Corbin&#x27;s former employer was suspected in. Shadegg served as Special Assistant Attorney General for Corbin between 1983 and 1990. He was also Corbin&#x27;s chief lobbyist, where he was the point man for the impeachment of Gov. Evan Mecham.

Shadegg served as special counsel to the Arizona state House Republican caucus in 1991 and 1992 and an adviser to the United States Sentencing Commission before entering the House.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Energy and Environment
** Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet
** Subcommittee on Health
* Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming

===Party leadership===
From 2000 to 2002, Congressman Shadegg served as chairman of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), a group of conservative House Republicans.

Following the 2004 election, Shadegg was elected Chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, the fifth-ranking position in the House Leadership. He was the only member of the Republican Class of 1994 serving in leadership until resigning the post to run for Majority Leader in January 2006.

On January 13, 2006, Shadegg officially joined the race for the House Majority Leader as a compromise alternative candidate to Representatives Roy Blunt and John Boehner. Shadegg received the support of the National Review, the Club for Growth, and the Arizona Republic. Feb. 2, after Shadegg came third in the first ballot, his supporters switched to second place Boehner, ensuring Boehner&#x27;s election on the second ballot.

Shadegg ran for House Minority Whip following the loss of Republican control of the House in November 2006, losing to Blunt.

==Political positions==
From the 104th Congress to the 111th Congress, Shadegg introduced the Enumerated Powers Act, although it has not been passed into law. At the beginning of the 105th Congress, the House of Representatives incorporated the substantive requirement of the Enumerated Powers Act into the House rules.

In 2007, he opposed several bills to set a deadline to withdraw troops from Iraq. Shadegg voted against the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which increased the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. Shadegg voted for a bill to build a fence along the border between the United States and Mexico (Secure Fence Act of 2006). In 2005, Shadegg voted against a bill to create a flag-burning amendment to the Constitution.

Shadegg is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

Shadegg is vehemently opposed to the Healthcare Reform Package that was tabled in October 2009. He said the reform package is a &quot;Soviet-style gulag health care&quot;, and will make American healthcare something akin to that available to the prisoners of Russian gulag.

On October 14, 2009, Shadegg joined with three fellow Representatives in calling for the investigation of CAIR (the Council on American-Islamic Relations) over allegations of trying to plant &quot;spies&quot;, based on a CAIR memo indicating that they &quot;will develop national initiatives such as Lobby Day, and placing Muslim interns in Congressional offices.&quot; The request came in the wake of the publication of a book, &quot;Muslim Mafia&quot;, the foreword of which had been penned by Congresswoman Sue Myrick, that portrayed CAIR as a subversive organization allied with international terrorists. CAIR has countered that these initiatives are extensively used by all advocacy groups and accused Shadegg and his colleagues of intending to intimidate American Muslims who &quot;take part in the political process and exercise their rights.&quot;

In November 2009, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg expressed confidence in the security of having five 9/11 suspects brought to trial in lower Manhattan, to which Shadegg gave an overheated response: &quot;Well mayor, how are you going to feel when it is your daughter that is kidnapped at school by a terrorist?&quot;. He later apologized to the mayor and his family for &quot;the insensitivity of my remarks.&quot;

On March 17, 2010, after criticizing the lack of a single-payer health care system or an alternative public option in health insurance reform proposals by the Obama administration, Shadegg, who has previously responded to the possibility of such a system as, &quot;full on Russian gulag, Soviet-style gulag health care&quot;, stated in an interview, &quot;I would support single-payer.&quot; Shadegg&#x27;s spokeswoman later clarified the remark, explaining that the Congressman believes that &quot;Forcing them [health insurance companies] to compete, even through a public option, would be better than an individual mandate which will not work.&quot;

On September 29, 2008, Shadegg voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which created the Troubled Assets Relief Program.

Despite his support of the second economic stimulus package bill, he voted &quot;NO&quot; on the first Economic Package and he also was a proponent of the 2009 Tea Party protests which condemned any bailouts, and even spoke at a rally in Phoenix.

On November 30, 2010, Shadegg declared his opposition to the extension of unemployment benefits on the basis that &quot;the unemployed will spend as little of that money as they possibly can&quot;, having commented to Mike Barnicle &quot;Your answer is it&#x27;s the spending of money that drives the economy and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right.&quot;

==Political campaigns==
Shadegg entered the Republican primary race for Arizona&#x27;s 4th District in 1994 after four-term incumbent Jon Kyl began what turned out to be a successful run for the United States Senate. Shadegg won a four-way primary with 43 percent of the vote, and won in November. He was reelected seven times.

===2006===

In 2006, the Democratic Party nominee was Herb Paine, who barely defeated his Democratic primary opponent, to face Shadegg in his November 2006 bid for reelection. Shadegg retained his seat with nearly 60% of the vote.

===2008===

Shadegg announced on February 11, 2008, that he would not run for an eighth term, saying that he wanted to &quot;seek a new challenge in a different venue to advance the cause of freedom.&quot; However, Shadegg retracted the statement on February 21 and announced he would seek reelection. Although it was speculated that he would run for the United States Senate in 2010 if John McCain had become president, Shadegg had expressed his intention to leave public life and return to the private sector before changing his mind.

===2010 retirement===

On January 14, 2010, Shadegg announced he would not run for reelection to a ninth term. In his statement, Shadegg says he will &quot;pursue my commitment to fight for freedom in a different venue.&quot;

Early in 2011, Shaddeg joined the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix as a senior fellow; but he is no longer formally affiliated with the group.

In 2011, Shadegg joined the law firm of Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP as a partner, working out of their Washington, DC, and Phoenix offices. In 2016, Shadegg joined the Polsinelli PC law firm in Phoenix as a partner.

<text>Edward Lopez Pastor (; June 28, 1943 – November 27, 2018) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Arizona from 1991 to 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented Arizona&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1991 to 2003, its 4th district from 2003 to 2013, and its 7th district from 2013 to 2015, all of which were anchored in downtown Phoenix.

==Early life==
Pastor was born in Claypool, Arizona, as the oldest of three children. After high school, he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry from Arizona State University (ASU). He became a chemistry teacher at North High School in Phoenix and later went on to work as deputy director of the community service group Guadalupe Organization Inc.

After returning to ASU to earn a J.D. degree, he became an assistant to Arizona Governor Raúl Héctor Castro. In 1976, Pastor was elected to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and he served three terms in that role as a county executive.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1991, Pastor entered a special election to succeed retiring 28-year incumbent Democrat Mo Udall in the 2nd District, which then comprised the southwestern part of Arizona, including half of Tucson and portions of southern Phoenix. Pastor won a narrow victory in the four-way Democratic primary, defeating his closest challenger, Tucson mayor Tom Volgy, by 1,800 votes. He was the only major candidate from the Phoenix share of the district.

He then won the special election a month later with 55 percent of the vote to become the first Latino to represent Arizona in Congress. He was reelected four times without substantive Republican opposition, never dropping below 60% of the vote.

Pastor&#x27;s former territory was renumbered as the 7th District following the 2000 census, but his home in Phoenix was drawn into the newly created 4th District. Rather than move to the Phoenix portion of the reconfigured 7th, he opted to run in the 4th. The newly created district was heavily Democratic and majority-Latino, with Democrats having a nearly 2-to-1 advantage in registration, similar to his old district. He was reelected six times against nominal Republican opposition.

===Tenure===

Pastor was one of the nine Chief Deputy Whips for the Democratic Caucus. Following in Udall&#x27;s footsteps, his voting record was decidedly liberal; for most of his tenure, he was the most liberal member of the Arizona congressional delegation. He was well-respected by members of both parties, and had a reputation for bipartisanship.

He was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was pro-choice, and in 2006 supported the interests of the Planned Parenthood 100 percent, according to their records. In 2006, NARAL Pro-Choice America-Endorsements endorsed Representative Pastor. He voted against the 2002 Iraq Resolution that started the Iraq War.

In 2011, Pastor voted against the National Right to Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011. He also voted against several bills that would encourage trade between countries such as Panama. Furthermore, he voted to encourage the display of &quot;In God We Trust&quot; in public buildings and schools.

In 2009-2010, Pastor was backed by the National Farmers Union. However, he was not supported by the National Council of Agricultural Employers.

Pastor was supported by the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund, which works to protect native wildlife and wild areas.

Around the mid-1990s, Pastor was backed by the Americans for the Arts Action Fund. However, since then, their support has dwindled somewhat.

Pastor had a strong stance on civil rights regarding sexual orientation and race. For example, in 2007, he voted to prohibit job discrimination based on sexual orientation and, in 2006, he voted against defining marriage as one man-one woman. Finally, in 2004, he voted against a constitutional amendment that would ban same-sex marriage. In 2002, the ACLU rated Pastor at 93% for a pro-civil rights voting record.

In February 2014, Pastor announced that he would not seek reelection and would instead retire upon the completion of his term.

==Legacy==

Multiple schools, parks and other institutions have been established in his honor.

The Ed Pastor Center for Politics and Public Service was founded in 2015 as part of the College of Public Service &amp; Community Solutions at Arizona State University. The Center serves as a dynamic, student-centric hub of activity that promotes, publicizes, and encourages political engagement and public service among ASU students and the broader community.

A section of Loop 202 in the Phoenix area was named in his honor.

Pastor has been credited with inspiring multiple generations of people dedicated to public service including Arizona State House Democratic Leader Charlene Fernandez.

==Personal life==

Pastor was married to Verma Mendez for 53 years and had two daughters, Yvonne and Laura. He died on November 27, 2018, following a heart attack in Phoenix at the age of 75.

<doc id="407923" wikidata="Q535103" url="?curid=407923" title="Radu the Handsome">
<text>Radu III of Wallachia, commonly called Radu the Handsome, Radu the Fair, or Radu the Beautiful (; ; January 1475), was the younger brother of Vlad the Impaler ( Vlad III) and prince of the principality of Wallachia. They were both sons of Vlad II Dracul and his wife, Princess Cneajna of Moldavia. In addition to Vlad III, Radu also had two older siblings, Mircea II and Vlad Călugărul, both of whom would also briefly rule Wallachia.
In 1462, he defeated his brother, Vlad III, alongside Ottoman Empire sultan Mehmed II, with whom Radu had a close relationship.

==Life with the Ottomans==

In 1436, Vlad II Dracul ascended to the throne of Wallachia. He was ousted in 1442 by rival factions in league with Hungary, but secured Ottoman support for his return by agreeing to pay tribute to the Sultan and also send his two legitimate sons, Vlad III and Radu, to the Ottoman court, to serve as hostages of his loyalty. Vlad and Radu were later educated in logic, the Quran and the Turkish and Persian language and literature. The boys&#x27; father, Vlad Dracul, with the support of the Ottomans, returned to Wallachia and took back his throne from Basarab II.

While Vlad was eventually released to take his place on the Wallachian throne in 1448 after his father was killed by John Hunyadi, Radu converted to Islam and was allowed into the Ottoman imperial court. Radu later participated alongside Mehmet II, now Sultan, in the Ottoman siege which eventually led to the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. Radu was allowed to live in the newly built Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. According to the Serbian Janissary Konstantin Mihailović, Radu was a commander of the Janissary; in the campaign against his brother Vlad III, Radu was at the head of 4000 horsemen.

==Struggles for the rule of Wallachia==
In November 1447, John Hunyadi launched an attack against Wallachia due to its alliance with the Ottomans by the treaties signed by Vlad II Dracul and his duplicity in Varna Campaign (1444). Radu&#x27;s father fled, but Mircea II was captured by boyars from Târgoviște and was blinded with a red-hot poker before being buried alive. A short time after their father was captured and killed by the forces of John Hunyadi, Vlad III was released in 1448 and was the Ottoman Turks&#x27; candidate for the throne of Wallachia, the first of a succession of times he would hold the throne, this first time for only a matter of months.

Radu&#x27;s brother Vlad III later went on to take the throne from Vladislav II in 1456 and began his second reign for which he was to become famous. Like his older brother Mircea II, Vlad III was an able military commander and now found himself opposing the Ottomans.

Radu, at the age of 22, became a leading figure at the Ottoman court. In 1461, Mehmed II began preparing to invade Wallachia. After consulting his astrologers, the thirty-year-old sultan resolved to personally lead the punitive expedition. His personal Janissary guard was larger than the entire army of Vlad III. Moreover, the sultan opted to reward Radu&#x27;s ongoing loyalty by setting him on the throne of Wallachia in Vlad III&#x27;s place.

In 1462, a massive Ottoman army marched against Wallachia, with Radu at the head of the Janissary. Vlad III retreated to Transylvania. During his departure, he practised a scorched earth policy, leaving nothing of importance to be used by the pursuing Ottoman army. When the Ottoman forces approached Târgoviște, they encountered over 20,000 of their kind impaled by the forces of Vlad III, creating a &quot;forest&quot; of dead or dying bodies on stakes. This atrocious, gut-wrenching sight was too much even for them to bear therefore they returned to Ottoman forces to regroup.

Vlad III waged a guerrilla campaign against the Ottoman forces commanded by the Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha in May 1462, pursuing them in their retreat as far as the Danube. On 16 and 17 June, he again defeated a sizable Ottoman force in what has become known as The Night Attack, which resulted in heavy casualties to the Ottoman army, as well as logistical losses.

After Mehmed II suffered losses from The Night Attack, Radu and his loyalists campaigned on the Danubian plains for support to replace his brother. It was not difficult to convince them; he only had to promise the boyars that he would restore their privileges and assure the defectors from Vlad III&#x27;s camp that they would not be punished. But above and beyond this, he preached of a lasting peace, a gentle reign, and no revenge for any past wrongdoings. Radu sent envoys to the Saxon cities hardest hit by Vlad III, tempting them with old-fashioned advantageous trade regulations and vouching for the sanctity of their families. His good nature attracted instant allies, including inhabitants of Bucharest and Târgoviște, who had enough of the cruelty of his brother.

Radu chased Vlad III to his castle north of Curtea de Argeș and, finally, out of Romania itself, which was incorporated under Ottoman control. Taking advantage of their fortune the Ottomans strengthened their commercial presence in the Danube against any Hungarian influence and intervention in the region.

Meanwhile, his brother Vlad III, due to his harsh policies towards the boyars (whose power struggles he blamed for the state of the realm), was betrayed by them. Vlad III travelled to Hungary to ask for help from his former ally, Matthias Corvinus. But instead of receiving help he found himself arrested and thrown into the dungeon over false charges of treason.

After the victorious campaign north of the Danube, the Ottomans placed the young Radu (then 26 years of age) as the Bey of Wallachia. Soon after, the Janissary under his command began attacks and raids on Vlad III&#x27;s mountain stronghold on the Argeș River, Poenari Castle. During his reign the Ottoman Sipahi&#x27;s gained a strong foothold in the south of the country.

In 7 March 1471, Radu fought the Battle of Soci against Stephen III, his future son-in-law, for possession of Chilia (now Kiliya in Ukraine). Slavo-Romanian chronicles relate that Stephen III had a &quot;war with Radu voivode for Soci&quot;. Stephen III&#x27;s relationships with Radu were hostile. He invaded Wallachia on several occasions during Radu&#x27;s reign, dethroning him four times in response to Radu&#x27;s vassalage.

In 1473, following an agreement with the Ottomans, Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân (Basarab Laiotă the Old) took over the throne. Between 1473 and 1475, Radu briefly returned twice to the throne.

He died in January 1475.

==Personal life==

Radu&#x27;s wife was Maria Despina (c. 1440-1500), daughter of Gjergj Arianiti and Maria Muzaka. Their daughter was Maria Voichița, who later married Prince Stephen III of Moldavia.

<doc id="407925" wikidata="Q1676304" url="?curid=407925" title="J. D. Hayworth">
<text>John David Hayworth Jr. (born July 12, 1958) is an American television host and former politician. He served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2007 from Arizona&#x27;s 5th Congressional District. He later hosted &quot;Newsmax Prime&quot;, a television news/talk prime time show that airs weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Newsmax TV. Previously, he hosted a conservative talk radio program on KFYI in Phoenix until January 2010, when he resigned due to his run for the U.S. Senate.

A graduate of North Carolina State University, Hayworth anchored sports reports for three television stations during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1994, Hayworth was elected to represent Arizona&#x27;s 6th congressional district, which was redistricted into the 5th District starting in the 2002 House elections. He was defeated in 2006 by Democratic candidate Harry Mitchell.

In 2010, he unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate, losing to incumbent Senator John McCain in the Republican primary.

==Early life, education, and broadcasting career==
Hayworth was born in High Point, North Carolina. His grandfather, Ray Hayworth, was a Major League Baseball catcher from 1926 to 1945. Hayworth received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in speech communications and political science from North Carolina State University in Raleigh in 1980, where he was student body president during his senior year.

He was a sportscaster for WPTF-TV in Raleigh/Durham, NC, WFBC-TV (now WYFF-TV), the NBC station in Greenville, South Carolina, from 1981 to 1986, and WLWT-TV in Cincinnati, Ohio from 1986 to 1987. From 1987 to 1994, he was the sports anchor on the news reports of KTSP-TV (later KSAZ-TV), which was then the CBS affiliate in Phoenix.

Hayworth married in 1989. He and his wife Mary have three children.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committees===
As a congressman, Hayworth served on the House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means. He was the first ever representative from Arizona to have served on the committee. While working on the committee, he was given a &quot;satisfactory&quot; (64 percent) rating from the National Taxpayers Union. Hayworth supported the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, signed into law by President George W. Bush.

===Campaigns===
In 1994, Hayworth ran in what was then the 6th District and defeated incumbent Democrat Karan English, taking 54 percent of the vote to English&#x27;s 42 percent. Hayworth criticized English&#x27;s support for Bill Clinton&#x27;s budget plan, which Hayworth termed the largest tax increase in history. English had been endorsed in her successful 1992 campaign by former state U.S. Senator and 1964 Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater when she ran against Doug Wead, but not in 1994 when she ran against Hayworth.

In 1996, Hayworth fired two of his campaign aides for their part in forging his signature to file a campaign affidavit on time. He won in 1996 with 48 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Steve Owens.

In 1998, Hayworth signed and filed the form in person, with television cameras, campaign volunteers, and the Arizona Secretary of State watching. He again defeated Owens, 52 percent to 45 percent.

His next three elections he won handily: He won in 2000 against Larry K. Nelson, 60 percent to 37 percent; in 2002 against Craig Columbus, getting 61 percent of the vote; and in 2004 against Justice Elizabeth Rogers, getting 60 percent.

During his first four terms, Hayworth represented a district that took in most of the northeastern portion of the state, including Flagstaff. Most of its population, however, was located in the Phoenix suburbs. After the 2000 census, his district was renumbered the 5th District and was made a much more compact district centered on the northeastern Valley—including all of Tempe, Scottsdale and Fountain Hills, western Mesa, and Chandler, and part of northeastern Phoenix. Despite a modest Republican registration advantage, it was considered to be slightly less conservative than other suburban Phoenix districts.

===Media profile===

Known for his outspoken nature—he called President Clinton an &quot;unprincipled philandering president&quot; who had &quot;the most corrupt administration in U.S. history&quot; – Hayworth is a frequent guest on conservative TV and talk radio. He sometimes substitutes as host of the nationally syndicated Laura Ingraham political commentary show on the Talk Radio Network.

Hayworth has never shied away from controversy. In the same campaign letter in which he criticized Clinton, he said his Democratic opponent was &quot;bankrolled by trial lawyers, radical homosexual rights groups, environmental extremists ... along with almost every other left-wing wacko group you can think of.&quot;

===Political positions===
Hayworth is a staunch conservative. He supports stronger border security and opposes the temporary worker program proposed by President George W. Bush for illegal aliens.

In January 2006, Regnery published &quot;Whatever It Takes: Illegal Immigration, Border Security, and the War on Terror&quot;, a book by Hayworth and his chief of staff, Joseph J. Eule. In the book, Hayworth said that Bush is too close to GOP contributors from the agribusiness, meat packing and construction industries, whom he calls &quot;addicted&quot; to a steady stream of workers from Mexico and Central America to keep wages down. Hayworth also argues that current immigration law misinterprets the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, saying that a child of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S. should not be given U.S. citizenship (a view he has reiterated during the 2010 campaign), and advocates the &quot;Americanization&quot; program Henry Ford advocated in an interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1914.

Hayworth is the chairman of the advisory committee of the United States Justice Foundation.

==2006 congressional campaign==
Hayworth had considered running for the Governor of Arizona in the 2006 elections against incumbent Democrat Janet Napolitano, but in March 2005 he announced that he preferred to stay in Congress. In the spring of 2005, Napolitano was enjoying a 79 percent favorable job rating.

In the 2006 election, Hayworth faced former Tempe mayor, state senator, and then-state Democratic Party chairman Harry Mitchell. A number of prominent Republicans endorsed Mitchell, and this defection appeared to have influenced the general election. CD-5, despite having a 60% Republican active registered voter advantage over Democrats (139,057 vs 86,743 in October 2006), nevertheless saw Hayworth narrowly defeated by Mitchell. While most media outlets called the race for Mitchell on election night, Hayworth refused to concede due to a large number of absentee and early-voting ballots. However, when it became apparent that Mitchell&#x27;s lead was too large to overcome, Hayworth conceded on November 14. He ultimately lost by 8,000 votes.

==Radio/TV talk show host==
On April 23, 2007, it was announced on Phoenix radio station KFYI that Hayworth would begin hosting an afternoon drive time (4–7 p.m.) talk show on the station starting April 26, 2007. Hayworth left his position as a political talk show host following his January 22, 2010 broadcast. At the time of his resignation he made the decision to challenge John McCain in the 2010 Republican primary election for U.S. Senate.

On January 3, 2012, Hayworth began a stint hosting a morning show on KSFO in San Francisco, California.

On April 10, 2012, former presidential candidate and former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee replaced Hayworth on KSFO. Hayworth was a sometime fill-in when Huckabee is away from his radio show.

On March 8, 2013, it was announced that Hayworth would become the new co-host for the morning talk show on XEPRS-AM 1090 in Tijuana/San Diego. He joined Lee Hamilton. On August 30, 2013, he left XEPRS 1090.

==2010 Senate campaign==

In November 2009, Rasmussen Reports released the results of a poll of likely 2010 Republican primary voters in Arizona showing a statistical tie in a hypothetical primary challenge to incumbent John McCain for the 2010 Republican U.S. Senate nomination in Arizona. Hayworth said he was considering running against McCain because he has &quot;a profound disagreement with Senator John McCain over the concept of amnesty, whether he wants to call it comprehensive immigration reform or a pathway for guest workers to remain.&quot;

In February, 2010, Hayworth announced that he was indeed running against McCain. By mid March, Rasmussen reported only 7 points separating the two. Some credit was given to other McCain challengers&#x27; dropping out, thereby allowing Hayworth to pick up their support.

During the campaign, Hayworth displayed his ignorance of history by stating that the United States never declared war on Germany during the Second World War. The United States, in response to Germany&#x27;s declaration of war against the United States, declared war on Germany on December 11, 1941.

It was also discovered that Hayworth, the alleged fiscal conservative, had participated in an infomercial in which he encouraged persons to obtain “free money” from the United States government through a program widely criticized as a scam, leading one person to call Hayworth a “trashy, idiotic crook.”

On August 25, 2010, Hayworth was defeated by John McCain 57–32% in the Arizona Senate primary.

<doc id="407926" wikidata="Q929581" url="?curid=407926" title="Jeff Flake">
<text>Jeffry Lane Flake (born December 31, 1962) is an American politician and diplomat who served as a United States senator from Arizona from 2013 to 2019. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the United States House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013 and later as the U.S. ambassador to Turkey from 2022 to 2024.

Born in Snowflake, Arizona, Flake attended Brigham Young University, from which he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in international relations, and later his Master of Arts degree in political science. In the early 1980s, he became a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Africa, where he learned to speak Afrikaans. After returning to the United States, Flake served as executive director of the Goldwater Institute, before being elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives from Arizona&#x27;s 1st congressional district in 2001. He served as the representative for the 1st district until renumbering following the 2000 census redefined the district to be Arizona&#x27;s 6th congressional district, which he then represented until he entered the Senate in 2013.

Flake sought the Republican nomination for the 2012 Senate election after incumbent Jon Kyl announced his retirement. He defeated Democratic candidate and former United States Surgeon General Richard Carmona in the general election. Flake was one of the bipartisan &quot;Gang of Eight&quot; U.S. senators who pushed an immigration reform bill through the Senate in 2013. He is known as a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, but generally voted in line with Trump&#x27;s positions. On October 24, 2017, Flake announced that he would not seek re-election in 2018.

Throughout his Senate career, Flake suffered from consistently low approval ratings. In April 2013, less than three months after taking office, he had 32% approval and 51% disapproval ratings. By mid-2017, he dropped to 18% approval and 62% disapproval ratings, but recovered slightly near the end of his term, with 30% approval and 51% disapproval ratings as of July 2018.

On January 29, 2019, Flake was hired by CBS as a contributor for CBS News. He was nominated by Democratic president Joe Biden as ambassador to Turkey and confirmed by the Senate on October 26, 2021. He presented his credentials to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at the Presidential Complex of Turkey in Ankara on January 26, 2022.

== Early life, education, and early career ==
Jeffry Lane Flake was born in Snowflake, Arizona, the son of Nerita (née Hock) and Dean Maeser Flake. His birth town was named in part for his great-great-grandfather, Mormon pioneer William J. Flake. Flake obtained a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations and a Master of Arts in political science from Brigham Young University. He took a two-year leave of absence to serve as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Africa and Zimbabwe in the early 1980s. He speaks Afrikaans. He worked in the public affairs sector after college and was the executive director of the Foundation for Democracy in Namibia and executive director of the Goldwater Institute before entering the House of Representatives. He opposed economic sanctions on South Africa in the 1980s, arguing that sanctions would harm the black population who were already suffering under apartheid policies.

==Political career==
=== U.S. House of Representatives (2001–2013) ===
==== Elections ====
Flake was first elected to Congress in 2000 from what was then the 1st District, after Republican incumbent Matt Salmon stepped down to honor a self-imposed term limit. The district, which included most of the East Valley, was then renumbered as the 6th district as Arizona gained two Congressional seats because of the results of the 2000 census. Flake easily defeated his primary challenger.

In his campaign in 2000, Flake had pledged to serve no more than three terms in Congress which would see him serve no later than January 2007. Shortly after being elected for a third time, Flake announced in early 2005 that he had changed his mind on pledging term limits and was planning to run for reelection in 2006. &quot;It was a mistake to limit my own terms,&quot; Flake said.

In that same election, three out of five mayors in his home district opposed his reelection because, according to Flake, he did not &quot;bring pork barrel spending&quot; to the mayors&#x27; cities. In 2006, several Democrats had announced their intention to run for the seat but only one met the June filing deadline, and that particular filing was rejected due to an insufficient number of nominating signatures. &quot;I did expect to have a primary opponent. I deserve one,&quot; Flake said, referring to the term-limit pledge which he had broken. &quot;By all rights, I ought to have an opponent. I just got lucky, I guess.&quot;

In the 2006 midterm elections, Flake had no Democratic Party opponent and easily defeated the Libertarian Party candidate, Jason Blair, with 74% of the vote.

==== Tenure ====

Flake was a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a group of libertarian-leaning Republican congressmen. He was also a member of the Republican Study Committee.

==== Committee assignments ====
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies

=== U.S. Senate (2013–2019) ===
==== 2012 election ====
In February 2011, Flake announced that he was running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl in 2012. Flake easily won the Republican nomination against real estate businessman Wil Cardon. He faced former United States&#x27; surgeon general Richard Carmona, who sought office for the first time in the general election. In May 2012, Flake led Carmona by 13 points in the polls. In an October 2012 poll by Public Policy Polling, Flake was trailing Carmona by two points. After the race tightened, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; criticized a controversial Flake ad that accused Carmona of having &quot;issues with anger, with ethics, and with women.&quot; Flake was endorsed by the &quot;Casa Grande Dispatch&quot;, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Senate Conservatives Fund, and the Club for Growth.

Flake defeated Democrat Richard Carmona 49–46% on November 6, 2012. He won mainly on the strength of carrying Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and 60 percent of the state&#x27;s population, by 77,200 votes, more than the overall margin of 67,900 votes. He also benefited from Mitt Romney, whom Flake considers a friend, carrying the state by 10 points in the presidential election.

==== Tenure ====
Flake succeeded retiring Republican U.S. Senator Jon Kyl on January 3, 2013.

Flake used his experience surviving in the wild for six days with a Democratic Senator to develop an idea to end partisan gridlock in Washington. In 2014, Flake and U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) were featured on a Discovery Channel reality TV show, &quot;Rival Survival&quot;, where the two stayed on a small Micronesian island for six days. Flake later joked during a speech at the National Press Club that sending both Senate leaders (Majority Leader Senator Harry Reid [D-NV] and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell [R-KY]) to a remote island together might reduce partisanship and allow more legislation to move forward.

Flake was on the field during practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game when the Congressional baseball shooting happened on June 14, 2017. He said the attendees were like &quot;sitting ducks&quot; and that it was likely that the Capitol Police saved their lives:

All of a sudden, we heard a very loud shot. Everybody thought &#x27;sounds like a gun&#x27;. The gunman was over by the third base dugout, with a clear view of the field and everybody on it. A lot of us dove into the dugout and tried to get as many as we could, but at that point, there was firing behind us from the security detail, the Capitol Police, and I started yelling back, &#x27;are you friendly?&#x27;—making sure that it was our guy, because we didn&#x27;t know if there were other shooters that had us surrounded, and were coming into the dugout.

Former President Obama called Flake that morning to extend his best wishes and prayers for the victims. Flake had flown with Obama from Washington, D.C., to Arizona in 2011 after the shooting of then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords.

On October 24, 2017, Flake announced in a speech that he would not seek a second term in the Senate. Flake&#x27;s speech, which was described by McKay Coppins as a &quot;thundering indictment of his party, his president, and his country&#x27;s political culture,&quot; was called &quot;the most important speech of 2017&quot; by Chris Cillizza.

In May 2018, Flake stated that he would donate to Democratic Senator Joe Manchin&#x27;s campaign if Don Blankenship (who had served time in prison) won the West Virginia Republican Senate primary. Blankenship was defeated by Patrick Morrisey.

=== U.S. ambassador to Turkey ===

After Joe Biden was elected President in 2020, Flake was seen as a contender for a job as an ambassador in Biden&#x27;s administration, along with several other moderate Republicans who were close with Biden.

In June 2021, it was reported that Biden was set to offer Flake a position as the United States ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa. Flake reportedly denied the rumor.

Flake was officially nominated by Biden to be the United States Ambassador to Turkey on July 13, 2021. On September 28, 2021, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. On October 19, 2021, his nomination was reported favorably out of committee. On October 26, 2021, Flake was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote. Flake was sworn in on December 10, 2021. He resigned in September 2024.

== Political positions ==
Jeff Flake has used the phrase &quot;traditionally conservative Republican&quot; to describe his political preference. The non-partisan &quot;National Journal&quot; published an analysis of his 2013 voting record and gave him a composite ideological score of 65% conservative and 35% liberal. &quot;The New York Times&quot; used an analysis of the Senate&#x27;s ideological composition and ranked Flake as the fourth most conservative Senator in 2017. The American Conservative Union gives Flake a lifetime 93% conservative score and the fiscally conservative Americans for Prosperity gave Flake a 98% lifetime score; the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization focused on civil rights and liberties, gave Flake a 53% rating in 2014 and a 35% rating in 2016. NumbersUSA, a group that supports immigration restriction gave Flake an F (14%) during the 115th congress.

=== Budget and economy ===

Flake is a fiscal conservative, and a critic of government waste and advocates reducing federal spending. He was described by columnist Robert Novak as an &quot;insistent reformer&quot;. Flake signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge and one of eight House members to receive a 100% approval rating from the American Conservative Union. A &quot;scourge of pork-barrel spending&quot;, Flake was ruled the least profligate spender in Congress by Citizens Against Government Waste in July 2007 and designated a &quot;taxpayer superhero.&quot; In 2008, Flake voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).

Flake is &quot;known for his ardent opposition to earmarks.&quot; He has been called an &quot;anti-earmark crusader,&quot; and frequently challenged earmarks proposed by other members of Congress. Starting in May 2006, he became prominent with the &quot;Flake Hour,&quot; a tradition at the end of spending bill debates in which he asked earmark sponsors to come to the house floor and justify why taxpayers should pay for their &quot;pet projects.&quot; He is credited with prompting House rule changes to require earmark sponsors to identify themselves.

Until September 2010, Flake issued a press release listing an &quot;egregious earmark of the week&quot; every Friday. The earmark was usually followed by Flake making a humorous comment; as an example, Rep. Flake once said of Congressman Jose Serrano&#x27;s $150,000 earmark to fix plumbing in Italian restaurants, &quot;I would argue this is one cannoli the taxpayer doesn&#x27;t want to take a bite of.&quot; The &quot;earmark of the week&quot; releases were ended and replaced with the &quot;So Just How Broke Are We?&quot; series of releases. In March 2010, the House Appropriations Committee implemented rules to ban earmarks to for-profit corporations, a change Flake supported. &quot;This is the best day we&#x27;ve had in a while,&quot; he said to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, which reported that approximately 1,000 such earmarks were authorized in the previous year, worth $1.7 billion.

In September 2018, Flake was among six Republican senators, Mike Lee, Pat Toomey, Rand Paul, David Perdue, and Ben Sasse, as well as Bernie Sanders, that voted against a $854 billion spending bill, meant to avoid another government shutdown. Said bill included funding for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education.

=== Disaster aid ===
In 2012, it was reported that Flake had on at least five occasions voted against legislation intended to prevent natural disasters and provide aid to those harmed by natural disasters. In 2005, Flake was one of only 11 House representatives to vote against a bill providing supplemental emergency funds to handle damage from Hurricane Katrina.

=== Donald Trump ===
Flake is known as a vocal critic of President Donald Trump. Trump was &quot;furious&quot; that Flake called on him to withdraw from the presidential race after the emergence of the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape. In August 2017, Flake published his book &quot;Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle,&quot; which expanded on his criticisms of Donald Trump.

In October 2017, upon announcing that he would not seek re-election in 2018, Flake delivered a speech on the Senate floor where he denounced the Trump Administration. Flake&#x27;s speech, which was described by McKay Coppins as a &quot;thundering indictment of his party, his president, and his country&#x27;s political culture,&quot; was called &quot;the most important speech of 2017&quot; by Chris Cillizza.

In May 2018, Flake said that Trump had &quot;debased&quot; the presidency, that he had a &quot;seemingly bottomless appetite for destruction and division,&quot; and that he possessed &quot;only a passing familiarity with how the Constitution works.&quot; Flake vowed to hold up some of Trump&#x27;s judicial nominees for lower courts positions until he obtained a non-binding vote in the Senate expressing opposition to Trump&#x27;s tariffs. He was one of two Republicans to vote against the confirmation of Trump&#x27;s nominee to be CIA Director, Gina Haspel. Flake also refused to push Trump to take a firmer stance on Russia. In November 2018, Flake announced that he would once again vote to hold up Trump&#x27;s nominees to the judiciary until the Senate voted on a bill to protect the independence of Robert Mueller&#x27;s FBI investigation. Flake was one of two Republicans to oppose the nomination of Thomas Farr to the federal judiciary; his opposition was crucial to the derailing of Trump&#x27;s nominee. However, according to FiveThirtyEight, Flake had voted with Trump&#x27;s position on legislative issues 84% of the time as of December 2018.

On August 24, 2020, Flake officially endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president. Flake was censured by the Arizona Republican Party on January 23, 2021 for his lack of loyalty to the party leadership. “If condoning the President’s behavior is required to stay in the Party’s good graces, I’m just fine being on the outs,” Flake wrote on Twitter before the vote.

On September 29, 2024, Flake announced on X, that he would be endorsing to Vice President Kamala Harris for president in 2024.

=== Environment ===

On December 2, 2014, the Senate passed the Bill Williams River Water Rights Settlement Act. The bill would put an end to a fight over water rights in the Bill Williams River Watershed in Arizona. Flake introduced the Senate version of the bill along with Senator John McCain. The bill also helps the Hualapai Native American tribe, which uses water from the watershed. The bill would put a limit on the amount of water that a local mining company can use, and it would give legal recognition to the tribe&#x27;s rights to the water source. The settlement would guarantee water rights for the tribe; provide water for Freeport&#x27;s mine in Bagdad, Arizona; and give the state of Arizona rights to a property area that would be used for a conservation program for several species.

Flake and McCain sent a letter to the head of the EPA, citing a number of reasons why the regulation would hurt Arizona. One of the senators&#x27; concerns was about waterways that only flow in certain parts of the year. Flake and McCain believe that if the EPA includes those types of waterways in the new regulations, the regulations would have a negative effect on Arizona&#x27;s agriculture industry. One of the reasons the EPA is using in deciding which waterways will fall under the new regulation is by concluding whether pollution in waterways will negatively affect other waters downstream. Flake and McCain asserted in their letter that little proof existed to back up such a conclusion, but the EPA responded by saying that the proposed regulation was carefully examined and was made with bipartisan input. Flake and McCain wrote that the new changes could make it harder for Arizona firefighters to fight wildfires.

Flake wrote that the EPA proposed rule did not make a distinction between waterways that flow all year or just part of the year. Flake said that 94 percent of Arizona&#x27;s waterways do not flow continuously year-round, and argued that the lack of distinction in the rule would affect most of Arizona&#x27;s waterways. He argued that the scientific evidence used by the EPA to back up the rule was &quot;anything but settled.&quot; Flake and McCain had written to the EPA administrator about their concerns earlier, on May 6, 2014. Despite Flake&#x27;s efforts against the bill, however, it was signed in to law by President Barack Obama on December 16, 2014.

=== Foreign policy ===
Flake voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution (authorizing the Iraq War) in the House of Representatives in October 2002. In a debate on the House floor on the authorization of force (October 8, 2002), Flake said, &quot;We ought to let history be our guide here. But the most recent history in this case that we ought to look at is the vote that took place in this Chamber 12 years ago. During that time, we faced a very similar decision. Should we thwart Saddam Hussein in his attempt to go beyond his boundaries or should we appease him? Fortunately, the majority of this body and the other body agreed we ought to thwart him; and I think we can all agree that, had we not done so, that the biological and chemical weapons that Saddam Hussein possesses would be added to nuclear weapons which he would certainly possess today had he not been thwarted at that time. We are in this position today, I would submit, because we have no other choice. This is our only reasonable option. War will no doubt come at great cost. When we visit the war memorials, we see that cost, but the cost of appeasement is far greater. I commend the House leadership for bringing this resolution forward and for shepherding it through process. I especially commend our President who so forcefully pushed for this resolution and who has so deliberately pushed for this resolution. I urge support for the resolution.&quot;

After the 2006 election in which Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives largely due to the unpopularity of the war in Iraq, Flake changed his position on the Iraq War to one of cautious opposition, including voting against appropriations. At a 2008 congressional hearing featuring General David Petraeus, Flake said, &quot;I still have a hard time seeing the big picture and what constitutes success [in Iraq]. That&#x27;s not just one side of the aisle with those kind of concerns. Many on this side of the aisle have that as well.&quot;

Flake supported ending the Cuba Trade Embargo and otherwise normalizing relations with Cuba.

Flake supported President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2014 decision to begin the process of normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba, despite opposition to the policy change from other Republican senators. Flake joined Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Patrick Leahy on a trip to Cuba to return Alan Gross to the United States. Gross, an American government contractor, had been imprisoned in Cuba for five years but was released as part of the agreement between Obama and Cuban leader Raúl Castro. Flake believes that the United States embargo against Cuba is flawed, stating, &quot;The policy that we&#x27;ve had in place for the past 50 years has done more in my view ... to keep the Castro regimes in power than anything we could&#x27;ve done.&quot; Flake has traveled to Cuba nine times and supports loosening restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba.

In August 2017, Flake co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which made it a federal crime for American states to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel, and allow states to cancel contracts with companies that support boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

=== Guns ===
On April 17, 2013, Flake joined 45 other senators in voting against the Manchin-Toomey Amendment, which would have required background checks on private gun sales. Following the vote, Flake was criticized for changing his position on background checks. Just days before the vote, he had sent the mother of one of the Colorado theater shooting victims a handwritten letter stating that &quot;strengthening background checks is something we agree on.&quot; In response to a question asking whether he was worried about potential political consequences vowed by gun-control groups, Flake replied, &quot;That&#x27;s the beauty of a 6-year term. I truly want to do something on this, but what has been a little upsetting is to hear people try to maintain that we were just caving to pressure, discounting any issues that we had with the legislation, with the language. That&#x27;s just not right.&quot; Following his no vote, Flake&#x27;s approval rating fell from 45% favorable—43% unfavorable, to 32% favorable—51% unfavorable according to one poll, making him the most unpopular senator in America .

In March 2013, he voted with Senators Lindsey Graham and Mark Begich on introducing a bill that would prevent people from buying guns who have used an insanity defense, were ruled dangerous by a court, or had been committed by a court to mental health treatment.

=== Immigration ===
In 2007, Flake introduced legislation that would have provided a path to legalization for illegal immigrants, granted temporary legal status to illegal immigrants who paid a fine and passed background checks, and created a guest worker program. Also in 2007, Flake was removed from the House Judiciary Committee by Republican Minority Leader John Boehner for &quot;bad behavior&quot;, which Boehner said was criticism of party leaders, though Flake himself attributed it to his support of comprehensive immigration reform.

In 2009, Flake introduced the Stopping Trained in America PhDs From Leaving the Economy (STAPLE) Act (H.R. 1791). The bill would have authorized students who earned a Ph.D. in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics from U.S. universities to be admitted for permanent residence and to be exempted from the numerical limits on H-1B nonimmigrants. The bill was reintroduced in 2011 and was referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement in February of that year.

In 2010, Flake voted against the DREAM Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrant minors provided that they join the military or go to university. In late October 2012, Flake stated that he may support it in the future.

In 2013, Flake was a member of the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot;—a bipartisan group of eight senators (four Democrats and four Republicans)—who sponsored an immigration overhaul bill. Flake said of the group: &quot;Pretty quickly we determined that everybody around that table wanted to do this. We weren&#x27;t looking to score political points.&quot; The Senate passed the bill with 68 votes, but the bill failed in the House.

When in November 2014, Obama announced on TV that he would use his executive powers to allow some undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States, Flake said that the best response would be not to shut down the government, but to pass a bill that addresses immigration problems. As for Obama&#x27;s executive plan, Flake said that he opposed it. Flake opposed using a government funding bill to stop Obama&#x27;s executive action, but Flake also said that he believed that both parties&#x27; strategies would make it more difficult to pass immigration reform legislation.

Flake has publicly said that he believes that the reason so many children in recent years have come across the U.S. border illegally without parents is because parents believe their children will be able to stay in the United States if they do so. Flake has said that the Republican Party needs to take a rational approach to solving immigration problems, and if it does not, the party will have a difficult time winning national elections. Flake said that Jeb Bush&#x27;s support of an immigration system reform makes Bush more electable in a general election. Flake supported Jeb Bush&#x27;s remarks about immigration being an act of love, and said, &quot;Growing up here in Arizona, I&#x27;ve seen what motivates those who come here illegally. Sure, some come with the intent to do harm or simply to take advantage of our generosity. But many come to find work to feed their families. To lump everyone who crosses the border illegally into the same class is unfair and unproductive.&quot;

Flake spoke out against President Donald Trump&#x27;s January 2017 executive order to prohibit immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. He stated that &quot;It&#x27;s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry.&quot;

=== &#x27;Paid patriotism&#x27; ===
In 2015, Flake and Senator John McCain published a report detailing what they called &quot;paid patriotism&quot; by the U.S. Department of Defense for using soldiers, military equipment and resources at professional sports events in the United States. The report gave evidence that taxpayer-funded patriotic displays extended not only to the NFL but also to Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Major League Soccer.

=== Roy Moore ===
In October 2017, Flake refused to support Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore in the December 2017 Senate special election in Alabama. Flake said that he could not support a candidate who believed that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. After the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported in November 2017 that a number of women had accused Moore of having pursued sexual relationships with them or sexually assaulted them when they were teenagers, Flake quickly condemned Moore and said he would prefer that Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, win the special election instead of Moore. On December 5, 2017, one week before the election, Flake donated $100 to the Jones campaign and posted a tweet which said &quot;Country over Party&quot;. Jones ultimately won the election, with Flake tweeting out &quot;Decency wins&quot;.

=== Social issues ===
In October 2008, &quot;Esquire&quot; named Congressman Flake one of the Ten Best Members of Congress, saying in part, &quot;A true conservative, Flake is as rare as the dodo. Republicans should learn from him, and liberals and libertarians will find in him a strong privacy-rights ally.&quot; During the 2005 debate on renewal of the expiring provisions of the USA Patriot Act, Jeff Flake successfully submitted several amendments to the bill in the House of Representatives. One required the FBI director to personally sign off on any request for library and bookstore records before applying to the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, but it was altered in the United States Senate version of the bill. Two of his amendments were signed into law and they subjected any National Security Letter and its gag order to a judicial challenge by the recipient, and narrowed the scope of &quot;Sneak and Peek&quot; warrants to have definite time limits on their duration and extensions before they need to notify the target of the investigation. Before that, &quot;Sneak and Peek&quot; warrants could be extended by the standard of not &quot;unduly delaying trial&quot; without any defined time limitation. This amended bill was titled the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and it was signed into law on March 9, 2006. This bill also required three Inspector General investigations that led to the discovery of exigent letters and National Security Letter abuses. On February 8, 2011, Flake voted to renew key provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. The vote failed. On February 10, 2011, Flake again voted to renew key provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. This vote succeeded.

On March 7, 2017, Flake introduced a bill to eliminate FCC Internet privacy rules that were passed under President Barack Obama. His proposed bill would allow Internet service providers to share and sell consumers&#x27; browsing history without consent. In regards to Obama&#x27;s FCC Internet Privacy rules, Flake stated that &quot;It is unnecessary, confusing and adds yet another innovation-stifling regulation to the Internet.&quot; Flake received $22,700 in donations from paid lobbyists representing Internet service providers and tech firms to sponsor the anti-privacy legislation. In April 2017, the legislation passed both houses of Congress, which were Republican-controlled, allowing ISPs to sell consumer browsing history and other information without the user&#x27;s consent. One constituent at a town-hall meeting told Flake that &quot;You sold my privacy up the river.&quot;

Flake is Pro-Life, opposing legal abortion, with exceptions for rape, incest, and to protect the life of the mother.

In 2010, Flake was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which repealed the U.S. military&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy, which banned openly gay service members. The Human Rights Campaign, which scores politicians&#x27; support for LGBT rights, gave Flake a score of 12% in the 115th Congress and a 32% in the 114th Congress. Flake had voted to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage with a Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004 and 2006.

In 2017, Flake voted three times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

Although he voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in 2007, which would have banned discrimination based on sexual orientation, Flake said he had concerns with the 2013 version, which includes both sexual orientation and gender identity. When the vote occurred on November 7, Flake cast his vote in favor of the 2013 version of ENDA.

Flake also cosponsored the bipartisan STATES Act proposed in the 115th U.S. Congress by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Colorado Senator Cory Gardner that would exempt individuals or corporations in compliance with state cannabis laws from federal enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.

=== Supreme Court ===

In March 2016, Flake said that Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama&#x27;s nominee for the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Antonin Scalia, should not be confirmed unless Hillary Clinton won the 2016 presidential election. Flake argued that should Clinton win, Garland should be confirmed in the Senate&#x27;s lame-duck session because he was less liberal than any nominee Clinton might put forward. After meeting with Garland in April, Flake reiterated this position, saying that confirmation hearings on Garland&#x27;s nomination should not be taken up until after the election, so that the American people could choose the next president, unless Clinton won, in which case, &quot;we ought to approve him quickly.&quot;

In April 2017, he voted to invoke cloture (end debate) on the nomination of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, putting an end to the Democratic filibuster. Flake also voted for the &quot;nuclear option,&quot; ending the ability to filibuster Supreme Court nominees. He stated, &quot;While changing Senate rules was not my preferred outcome, this will simply make de jure what was de facto prior to 2003, when filibusters were virtually never used on the executive calendar.&quot;

On September 28, 2018, Flake announced his intention to vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh had been accused of sexual assault by a number of women, including Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who testified for several hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee the day before Flake&#x27;s announcement. Kavanaugh subsequently testified and denied the allegations. Flake said that Ford&#x27;s testimony was &quot;compelling&quot;, but added that Kavanaugh&#x27;s response was &quot;persuasive&quot; and left him &quot;with as much doubt as certainty&quot; regarding what had occurred. Following his announcement, Flake was confronted by Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher, two anti-Kavanaugh protestors who had evaded security, in a Senate office building elevator. They were later removed. Despite their pleas, Flake voted not to subpoena Mark Judge (whom Ford had claimed was present during the supposed assault) to appear before the Judiciary Committee. That afternoon, Flake voted to advance Kavanaugh&#x27;s nomination out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said he was a &quot;yes&quot; vote &quot;only if the final Senate vote [was] delayed for one week, during which time the FBI [could] investigate sexual harassment allegations against Kavanaugh&quot;; Senate Republican leaders agreed to support the proposed investigation. Later that day, President Trump directed the FBI to undertake a one-week, extremely limited investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which found no corroboration for the charges against Kavanaugh. Democrats criticized the investigation as a sham since neither Ford nor Kavanaugh were interviewed by the FBI.

=== Trade ===
In November 2018, Flake was one of twelve Republican senators to sign a letter to President Trump requesting the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement be submitted to Congress by the end of the month to allow a vote on it before the end of the year as they were concerned &quot;passage of the USMCA as negotiated will become significantly more difficult&quot; if having to be approved through the incoming 116th United States Congress.

== Personal life ==
Flake and his wife Cheryl (née Bae) have been married since 1985. They live in Mesa and have five children. The Flakes are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Flake spent time in Zimbabwe and South Africa as a missionary. His uncle, Jake Flake, served in both houses of the Arizona state legislature, including as speaker of the state house.

In 2009, while serving as a Representative, Flake spent a week alone on the island of Jabonwod, one of the Marshall Islands, as a survivalist venture. He survived by eating crabs, coconuts, and fish. Having enjoyed the experience, he decided to repeat it when he was a senator, this time bringing his two youngest sons with him to another island in the area, Biggarenn, for four days during a congressional recess in 2013.
