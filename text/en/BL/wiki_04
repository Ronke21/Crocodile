<text>Meles Zenawi Asres (Tigringa and ; ), born Legesse Zenawi Asres (8 May 1955 – 20 August 2012) was an Ethiopian politician and a former anti-Derg militant who served as president of Ethiopia from 1991 to 1995 and as prime minister from 1995 until his death in 2012.

Born in Adwa to an Ethiopian father and an Eritrean mother, Meles became actively involved in politics after changing his original first name from Legesse to Meles, adopted following the execution of fellow university student Meles Takele by the Derg government in 1975. In that year, he left Haile Selassie I University to join the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) and fight against the Derg (the Mengistu Haile Mariam-led military dictatorship in Ethiopia). In 1989, he became the chairman of the TPLF, and the head of the Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) after its formation in 1988.

After leading the EPRDF to victory in the Ethiopian Civil War, he served as president of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia from 1991 to 1995, then as the 2nd prime minister of Ethiopia from 1995 to his death in 2012. Meles Zenawi&#x27;s administration brought Ethiopia to ethnic federalism; he expressed his populist view that ethnic groups should share their own languages, culture and lands. An Eritrean referendum was held during his four-year presidency, which resulted in Eritrean secession from Ethiopia in 1993, but the two countries entered into a war owing to the territorial dispute from 1998 to 2000, during which 98,217 people were killed. In the 2005 general election, Meles&#x27;s party EPRDF won and he remained as prime minister, while opposition parties strongly complained that the election was &quot;stolen&quot; and unfair. Shortly during and after the election, disastrous riots and protests sparked across Addis Ababa, in which 193 people were killed by police brutality.

During his tenure, Ethiopia became one of Africa&#x27;s fastest-growing economies. Meles undertook major reforms to the country, including land reforms attempt to reduce serious droughts, school expansions, and agricultural interests. &quot;Zenawism&quot; refers to his principles and policies of ethnic federalism, especially those the TPLF advocated, and is the subject of academic study. He died in Brussels on 20 August 2012 from an undisclosed illness.

==Early life and education==

Meles was born in Adwa in northern Ethiopia, to Zenawi Asres, a Tigrayan from Adwa and Alemash Ghebreluel, an Eritrean from Adi Quala. He was the third of six children. His first name at birth was Legesse (thus Legesse Zenawi, Ge&#x27;ez: ለገሰ ዜናዊ &quot;legesse zēnāwī&quot;). He eventually became better known by his nom de guerre &quot;Meles&quot;, which he adopted in honor of university student and fellow Tigrayan Meles Tekle who was executed by the Derg government in 1975. He received primary education at Queen of Sheba Junior High School in Adwa. Because he started school at age 11 or 12 it took him 5 years to complete the regular 8-year program as he was able to skip grades. He then joined the prestigious General Wingate High school in Addis Ababa on full scholarship and completed high school in 1972. Upon graduating with honors from General Wingate, he was awarded the Haile Selassie I Prize, a selective award given only to the most outstanding students. In 1975, Meles left the university to join the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front.

Meles Zenawi is an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian.

== Early political career ==
=== Ethiopian Civil War (1974–1991) ===
Meles was first with the Tigrayan National Organization (TNO), the forerunner of the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF). Aregawi Berhe, a former member of the TPLF, notes that historians John Young and Jenny Hammond &quot;vaguely indicated&quot; Meles as a founder of the TPLF in their books. Aregawi insists that both he and Sebhat Nega joined the Front &quot;months&quot; after it was founded. While a member of the TPLF, Meles established the Marxist-Leninist League of Tigray (MLLT).

The TPLF was one of the armed groups struggling against the Derg, the junta which led Ethiopia from 1974 to 1991. Meles was elected member of the leadership committee in 1979 and chairman of the executive committee of TPLF in 1983. He was the chairperson of both the TPLF and the EPRDF. After the EPRDF assumed power at the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in 1991. He was president of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia during which he paved the way for Eritrea to secede from the country.

==President of Ethiopia (1991–1995)==

=== Domestic affairs ===
Meles stated that EPRDF&#x27;s victory was a triumph for the thousands of TPLF-fighters who were killed, for the millions of Ethiopians who were victims of the country&#x27;s biggest famine during the Derg regime, when some estimates put up to 1.5 million deaths of Ethiopians from famine and the Red Terror. Accordingly, he maintained that the big support it received from peasants and rural areas helped EPRDF maintain peace and stability. Foreign support was diverse; the Arab League, as well as Western nations, supported the EPRDF rebels against the communist Soviet-supported government (although the TPLF was at the time Marxist) at the height of the Cold War.

&quot;What the implications of this will be in terms of relations between Ethiopia and the European Union, we will have to wait and see but I don&#x27;t think you will be surprised if Ethiopia were to insist that it should not be patronised.&quot;

The United States did not facilitated peace talks between different rebel groups including EPRDF and the Derg to bring an end to the civil war which lasted for nearly 17 years and reach some kind of political settlement in 1991. The talks did not bear any fruit as EPRDF&#x27;s force were moving to the capital and Mengistu fled the country. The United States agreed to support the EPRDF which would have, nevertheless, seized power without anyone&#x27;s support. Many angry demonstrators in Addis Ababa reacted to this by protesting against Herman Cohen, the U.S. State Department&#x27;s chief of African affairs who attended a conference that demonstrators viewed as legitimizing the EPRDF.

In July 1991, the Convention of Nationalities was held. It was the first Ethiopian multinational convention where delegates of various nations and organizations were given fair and equal representation and observed by various international organizations including the United Nations, Organization for African Unity, European Economic Community, and the United States and the United Kingdom.

=== Foreign affairs ===
Although Meles and his administration claimed they preferred a united but federal state that included the Eritrean state, since Meles&#x27; TPLF fought together with EPLF, Meles did not have a choice but to leave the decision to Eritrean leadership in the hope that the independence referendum would vote against secession, according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1991 analysis. The Eritreans were given the choice for independence or to stay in the union. They voted for independence on 24 May 1993, Isaias Afewerki became the leader of Eritrea. Meles was in Asmara, Eritrea as the keynote speaker. Many in the Meles administration, as well as opposition parties, were angry over the decision to grant Eritrea its independence.

Despite working together against the Derg regime, Meles and Isaias positive relationship turned sour after Meles succumbed to U.S. pressure to hold an election within a year, but Afewerki abandoned his original promise to create a transitional government in the early 1990s. The Eritrean-Ethiopian War began in May 1998 following the Eritrean troops invasion of Badme and parts of Sheraro woredas. Following the invasion Ethiopia demanded that the Eritrean troops leave the invaded areas completely. However, the Eritrean government refused to pull out. Then the Ethiopians responded with huge counter - offensive measures which subsequently lead to the capture of the disputed Badme area and most parts of western Eritrea, and Ethiopian President Negaso Gidada gave a victory speech and a peace treaty was signed a few weeks later. According to the peace treaty Ethiopia then pulled out of the Eritrean Territory. Though Ethiopian troops controlled Badme, after the Algiers Agreement (2000) ruled that Badme belonged to Eritrea, Ethiopia continued to maintain a presence of its soldiers in the town.

== Prime Minister of Ethiopia (1995–2012) ==

A new constitution was approved in 1994, providing for a parliamentary system. The president served as ceremonial head of state, with the prime minister as head of government and chief executive. The EPRDF handily won the 1995 elections, and Meles was sworn in as prime minister when the new Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia was formally inaugurated on 21 August 1995.

=== First term (1995–2000)===
Meles was appointed as Prime Minister after the 1995 general election, and was chairman of the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front. Under his government, Meles encouraged privatization of government companies, farms, lands, and investments which reversed the previous Derg communist rule.

====Ethnic federalism====

Meles&#x27; government implemented ethnic based federalism as a response to what he considered to be the &quot;old imperial rule of Amhara people&quot;. Meanwhile, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), while drafting the constitution counted Amharas and Tigrayans dominated the imperial rule likewise. Reasons posited the aim of ethnic federalism empowers all ethnic groups in Ethiopia to share their cultures and languages, and ethnic-based liberation front preferred to join the July Convention of Nationalities in 1991. Critic always commented this system brings to divisions, which on other hands, Meles argues it gives several interests, equitable distribution and wealth to them. He added that the system provides recourse to fight poverty, peasants must choice their own decisions in their own languages. Meles views emphasized an economic growth claiming &quot;if you think it is threat, it will be; if you think it a benefit, then it will be. Ethnicity will become less an issue as the economy grows and Ethiopia&#x27;s process of assimilation does its job.&quot;

His government criticized for decentralizing of language system. Critics concerned that this policy would fracture Ethiopian national identity. Regions of Ethiopia have their official state language. For example, Afaan Oromo is the official language of Oromia Region, Afar for Afar Region, Harari for Harari Region. Amharic is official working language to Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambela, and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People&#x27;s Region.

====Freedom of religion====

Meles&#x27; government allowed freedom of religion formally in 1991. Previous issues including Orthodox Church dominance prior 1974, seizure of church by the Derg regime, state sponsored persecution against non-Orthodox Christians, second-class citizenship accorded to Ethiopian Muslims, and land owning issues by non-Orthodox population almost resolved. However, most analysis stated that there was sporadic clashes since equality and rights granted by national or new religions.

====Freedom of press====
Prior to federalism, both the Haile Selassie and Derg government limited media rights. During Meles&#x27; administration, however, politically inflicted media organization became decelerated, while entertainment surging in opposite. It was believed that FM radio stations were licensed under regional governments, community organizations and private companies. The government licensed seven regional state television transmission agencies, but there are not private broadcasters in the country.

====Equity and growth====
Meles government advocated &quot;pro-poor&quot; domestic policy. According to World Bank&#x27;s East African leadership, the Ethiopian government ranked first to share GDP for &quot;pro-poor&quot; sectors. It also created regional development to Amhara Development Association, Tigray Development Association, Oromia Development Association and many others. 
Meles government worked the country to economically grow steadily since he took an office. During the last seven years, Ethiopia&#x27;s GDP growth had shown 9 percent of rate. The country also topped to the category &quot;policies of social inclusion and equity&quot; in domain of &quot;economic management&quot;, while Ethiopia was successful scoring &quot;structural policies&quot; and &quot;public sector management and institutions&quot;. Gross primary enrollment rate which was initially poor, went 93% in 2004 from 72% in 1990, raising literacy rate from 50% in 1997 to 65% in 2002. Opposition parties contested those growth rate, stating double-digit inflation comes from a result of ruling party government economic failure.
Ethiopia became the fastest growing countries in Africa.

===Second term (2000–2005)===

In 2000 general election, Meles reelected as prime minister, with opposition parties like United Ethiopian Democratic Forces (UEDF) shared parliament seats. According to Ethiopian Human Rights Council, local UN staff, diplomatic missions, political parties, domestic non-governmental organizations, both general and regional elections were free and fair in most areas. However, there was misconduct in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People&#x27;s Region, particularly in the Hadiya Zone.

====School expansions====
Ethiopia has expanded schools partially since 1990 without regional coverage. Meles rearranged school expanding scheme with million of Ethiopian birr; while his policy focussing around agricultural sector, the jobs in urban areas became declined, resulting in opposition from students and urban residents as well. In 1991, 27% of Ethiopian children attended school. The growth enrollment doubled to 77% and reached 85% in November 2006. As of 2005, there were 13,500 elementary schools and 550 secondary schools. Secondary schools were aided by satellite program called &quot;School-Net&quot;.

Under his leadership, many universities and colleges unprecedentedly expanded and constructed. Those higher institutions include Adama University, Jimma University, Mekelle University, and newly built Debub University. Other are Awassa College and Bahir Dar University. It also implemented various departments and faculties. and the new Wolaita Soddo University started taking in students in February 2007.

====Land and agriculture====

Ethiopia frequently suffered from droughts throughout its history. Under his office, major droughts occurred in 1999/2000, 2002/2003 and 2009/2010.

Meles government encouraged collectivist land reforms and redistribution at local levels. However, the constitution deemed has shortcomings. Article 40, section 3 states that, &quot;The right to own rural and urban land as well as natural resources belongs to only to the state and the people.&quot; The farmers use uncertain transfer rights whilst using lands. Since 2008, the government announced &quot;empty&quot; land leasing to foreign investors. This outlook considered by some holders &quot;land grabbing&quot; with a risk of losing their plots.

The EPRDF once convinced that land should not be privatized, farmers would pay their land after drought. His government believed privatization should be implemented potentially, but not presently.

===Third term (2005–2010)===

The EPRDF faced an unprecedented challenge from opposition groups like the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD), UEDF, and the Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement in the 2005 election. It was one of the most controversial elections in Ethiopian history, and the opposition accused the EPRDF of electoral fraud. Demonstrations broke out in Addis Ababa and protesters were massacred by government forces—763 people were killed and over 10,000 were imprisoned.

In spite of the 2005 Ethiopian general election violence, the Administrator of USAID recognized an EPRDF electoral victory and accused European Union election observers who were critical of the outcome of doing a &quot;bad job&quot; and of &quot;favoring opposition groups&quot;.

===Fourth term (2010–2012)===
The TPLF administration strongly regards gender equality; Meles&#x27; wife and First Lady Azeb Mesfin was forefront advocator in women rights. Meles government encouraged all-encompassing women participations, organized forums to discuss backward issues in national television. Discussions include concerning tangential issues, HIV transmission, premature marriage, job opportunities and more. Various organizations emerged for example the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association (EWLA), Kembatti Mentti Gezzima-tope and Network of Ethiopian Women&#x27;s Associations.

====2012 journalist verbal attack====
On 18 May 2012, Meles attended to Food Security 2012 G8 Summit in Washington D.C to discuss agricultural transformation in Africa to deal with unification of farmers and private sectors. Abebe Gelaw, a Washington-based Ethiopian journalist disrupted the conference by yelling at the podium against Meles with words:

Meles Zenawi is a dictator! Meles Zenawi is a dictator! Free Eskinder Nega! Free political prisoners! You are a dictator. You are committing crimes against humanity. Food is nothing without freedom! Meles has committed crimes against humanity! We need freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

Abebe was escorted by guards and detained. Abebe noted in his latest speech, &quot;I voiced the anger, frustration and aspiration of the Ethiopian people in front of world leaders...Some are calling me a hero, others says I deserve honours. While I appreciate all the outpour of support, this is not about me. It is not about my heroism but the truth that must be told with utmost clarity. It is about our country, people, and the freedom and dignity we deserve.&quot;

=== Foreign affairs ===
Meles moved to have Ethiopia gain a larger share of the Nile River water. Part of this entailed using Ethiopia&#x27;s hydropower prospects as leverage in exporting power to Egypt, amongst others. He had also aided the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army/Movement prior to independence of South Sudan as the rebels fought the government in Khartoum. Since the War on Terrorism, Meles sought to consolidate hegemony of Ethiopia in East Africa, including his mediation efforts with Sudan and South Sudan, as well as stabilizing Somalia towards the end of the mandate of the Transitional Federal Government. Though he had controversially sent troops to fight against the Islamic Courts Union, he had been praised for working towards a stable situation along with the African Union since 2009.
====Eritrea====

Meles Zenawi and President of Eritrea Isaias Afwerki were on good terms, as Eritrean forces helped TPLF overthrow the Derg. As the TPLF came to power in Ethiopia, it had occurred simultaneously with the EPLF&#x27;s rise to power in Eritrea. After the 30 years of war between the two countries, the people of both countries enjoyed the fruit of peace, but not for long. In 1998, the Ethiopian government waged war with Eritrea on basis of border conflicts. The war comes to end in 2000. During the war, between 70,000 and 98,217 people were killed and 650,000 displaced. The Algiers Agreement was a peace agreement between the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia signed on 12 December 2000, at Algiers, Algeria, which was supposed to be final and binding. Nevertheless, Meles Zenawi refused to pull back Ethiopian forces for Eritrean territory, leading to a no-war-no-peace situation in the region. Ethiopian forces reside in the sovereign lands of Eritrea, around the town Badme despite the EEBC Border ruling granting Badme to Eritrea. Eritreans feel Meles Zenawi and the TPLF have betrayed them and he is responsible for the loss of lives, relationships, and mutually benefiting opportunities of the two countries.

====Somalia====
Meles declared war on the ICU unprovoked in order to curry favor with the West. In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union assumed control of much of the southern part of Somalia and promptly imposed Shari&#x27;a law. The Transitional Federal Government sought to reestablish its authority, and, with the assistance of Ethiopian troops, African Union peacekeepers and air support by the United States, managed to drive out the rival ICU. On 8 January 2007, as the Battle of Ras Kamboni raged, TFG President and founder Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former colonel in the Somali Army, entered Mogadishu for the first time since being elected to office. The Somali government then relocated to Villa Somalia in the capital from its interim location in Baidoa. This marked the first time since the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.

In October 2011, a coordinated multinational operation began against Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia, with the Ethiopian military eventually joining the mission the following month. According to Ramtane Lamamra, the AU Commissioner for Peace and Security, the additional Ethiopian and AU troop reinforcements are expected to help the Somali authorities gradually expand their territorial control.

====Climate change====

Meles played an important role in developing the African Union&#x27;s position on climate change since 2009 and was a &#x27;friend of the Chair&#x27; at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

On 31 August 2009, Meles was appointed Chair of the African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC). The group had been established following 4 February 2009 decision at the 12th AU Assembly of Heads of States to build a common Africa position on climate change in preparations for COP15.Prior to Meles&#x27; appointment, but in light of the AU&#x27;s decision and the Algiers Declaration on the African Common Platform to Copenhagen, on 19 May 2009 the Africa Group made a submission to the UNFCCC that included demands for US$67 billion per year in finance for adaptation funding and US$200 billion per year for mitigation and set targets in terms of reductions of emissions by developed countries not by reference to temperature.

On 3 September 2009, Meles made a speech to the Africa Partnership Forum, where he said:

We will never accept any global deal that does not limit global warming to the minimum unavoidable level, no matter what levels of compensation and assistance are promised to us... While we will reason with everyone to achieve our objective, we will not rubber-stamp an agreement by the powers that be as the best we could get for the moment. We will use our numbers to delegitimize any agreement that is not consistent with our minimal position. If needs be we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations that threaten to be another rape of our continent.
==Illness and death==

In July 2012, questions arose concerning Meles&#x27; health when he did not attend African Union summit meetings in Addis Ababa. Opposition groups claimed that Meles may have already died on 16 July while undergoing treatment in Belgium; however, Deputy Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn attributed Meles&#x27; absence to a minor illness. A press conference, during which the government planned to clarify Meles&#x27; health status, was scheduled for 18 July but postponed until later in the week. While the government acknowledged that Meles had been hospitalised, it stated that his condition was not serious. There were further rumours of his death when he was not seen in public after the 2012 G20 summit and at the time of the death of the head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abune Paulos.

On 20 August, Meles Zenawi died after contracting an infection in Belgium.

Minister of Information Bereket Simon announced on state television: 

It&#x27;s a sad day for Ethiopia. The man who led our country for the past 21 years and brought economic and democratic changes, has died. We have lost our respected leader. Meles has been receiving treatment abroad. He was getting better and we were expecting him to return to Addis Ababa. But he developed a sudden infection and died around 11:40pm last night. His body will be returned to Ethiopia soon. We have set up a committee to organise his funeral. More information will be released about that soon. As per Ethiopian law, Hailemariam Desalegn has now taken over the leadership. He will also be in charge of the Ethiopian military and all other government institutions. I would like to stress, nothing in Ethiopia will change. The government will continue. Our policies and institutions will continue. Nothing will change in Ethiopia. Desalegn will be confirmed by parliament.

After his body was repatriated two days later, thousands of mourners congregated on streets from the airport to Meles&#x27; former residence to pay their last respects as his coffin, draped in the flag of Ethiopia, was accompanied by a military band. The event was attended by political, military, and religious leaders, as well as diplomats and his wife, Azeb Mesfin. The body lie in state. A declaration of national mourning was also issued. There were also fears of a power vacuum after his death, as well as a possible detriment to Eritrea-Ethiopian relations.

Meles&#x27;s funeral took place in Addis Ababa on 2 September 2012 in a religious ceremony attended by at least 20 African presidents and thousands of Ethiopians gathered in Meskel Square.

*United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron called Meles &quot;an inspirational spokesman for Africa.&quot;
*United States President Barack Obama released the statement: &quot;It was with sadness that I learned of the passing of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia. Prime Minister Meles deserves recognition for his lifelong contribution to Ethiopia&#x27;s development, particularly his unyielding commitment to Ethiopia&#x27;s poor. I met with Prime Minister Meles at the G-8 Summit in May and recall my personal admiration for his desire to lift millions of Ethiopians out of poverty through his drive for food security. I am also grateful for Prime Minister Meles&#x27;s service for peace and security in Africa, his contributions to the African Union, and his voice for Africa on the world stage. On behalf of the American people, I offer my condolences to Prime Minister Meles&#x27; family and to the people of Ethiopia on this untimely loss and confirm the U.S. Government&#x27;s commitment to our partnership with Ethiopia.

Western NGOs Amnesty International called for the new administration to end Meles&#x27; &quot;ever-increasing repression&quot; and Human Rights Watch similarly added that the next administration should repeal the 2009 anti-terrorism law. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked about a gap between the United States of America&#x27;s strategic and ideological goals in relation to its support for Meles&#x27; government, it quoted HRW researcher Leslie Lefkow as saying: &quot;There is an opportunity here. If donors are shrewd, they will use the opportunity that this presents to push a much stronger and bolder human rights stance and need for reform.&quot; Author Dan Connell, who had interviewed Meles in June, said that &quot;he seemed focused [then] on wrapping up a number of major projects as if he were aware the end was near. Meles knew his days were numbered.&quot; The Committee to Protect Journalists cited and criticised the secrecy around Meles&#x27; death. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that the &quot;circumstances of his death remained laced with intrigue&quot;.

Regional groups responded with the Ogaden National Liberation Front saying it hoped his death &quot;may usher [in] a new era of stability and peace&quot; and Al Shabaab that it was celebrating the &quot;uplifting news&quot;.

==Personal life==

Meles acquired an MBA from the Open University of the United Kingdom in 1995 and a masters of science in economics from the Erasmus University of the Netherlands in 2004.

==Legacy==
===Economic prosperity of Ethiopia===
During Prime Minister Meles Zenawi&#x27;s rule, Ethiopia prospered economically (with double-digit economic growth for his last 9 years). The high economic growth is continuing 7 years after his death, since his party Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front and EPRDF continued to work with the same policies. Ethiopia even became the fastest-growing economy in Africa.

===Titles, awards and honors===
Prime Minister Meles received various international awards for setting up a good foundation for the development of Ethiopia.

Acknowledging the rapid GDP growth of the country, the UK newspaper &quot;The Economist&quot; said in December 2007 that &quot;Ethiopia&#x27;s economy has been growing at record speed in recent years.&quot; In 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) described the speed of Ethiopia&#x27;s economic growth in recent years as the &quot;fastest for a non-oil exporting country in Sub-Saharan Africa&quot;, with Ethiopia ranked as the second-most attractive African country for investors.

* Prime Minister Meles served as the Chairman of the Organization for African Unity (OAU, now the African Union – AU) from June 1995 to June 1996.
* In 2007, the African Union elected Meles to chair the executive committee of the NEPAD (the New Partnership for Africa&#x27;s Development)
* Meles was chosen to represent Africa at the G8 Summit and the G20 summit in London.
* In February 2010, the UN named Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles as co-chair of the Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing, a new high-level U.N. advisory group on climate change financing.

===Milestones===
Several social, economic, religious, and political developments and systems were established for the first time in Ethiopia under Meles&#x27; rule.
* First regional referendum for peaceful Secession (Eritrea, 1991–)
* First Multi-party National election for opposition (2000, 2005, 2010)
* First institutionalized linguistic freedom at the local level (1994–)
* First ethnic-based federalism (since 1994)
* First private media outlets in Ethiopian history (since 1994)
* First consecutive double-digit GDP growth – International Monetary Fund (since 2006)

===Foundation===
Meles was given the Green Revolution award and a financial prize of 200,000 dollars by the Norwegian Yara Foundation in September 2005 &quot;in recognition of past accomplishments and encouragement to achieve economic development for the people of Ethiopia.&quot;

Meles donated his $200,000 financial award to a foundation called &quot;Fre—Addis Ethiopia Women Fund&quot; (Fre-Addis Ethiopia Yesetoch Merja Mahiber). The Fre-Addis Ethiopia Women Fund has an objective &quot;to empower girls through providing educational opportunities&quot; and it currently supports 514 needy and orphan rural girls to pursue their education throughout the country.

On 6 April 2013, the Meles Zenawi Foundation was established to honor his legacy. It was inaugurated at 7th congress of African Union in Addis Ababa.

==Quotations==
* &quot;They don&#x27;t want to see a developed Africa. They want us to remain backward to serve their tourists as a museum&quot; - in response to critics of the hydro dam and other development projects
*&quot;I regret the deaths but these were not normal demonstrations. You don&#x27;t see hand grenades thrown at normal demonstrations&quot;—on a post-election issue
*&quot;Africa&#x27;s downfall has always been the cult of the personality. And their names always seem to begin with M. We&#x27;ve had Mobutu and Mengistu and I&#x27;m not going to add Meles to the list.&quot;—Dimbleby questioning Meles on his exposure to the people.
* post-Eritrean-Ethiopian war complications
*&quot;..countries pretend their foreign policy is based on democratisation when this is clearly not the case. For all the challenges in Zimbabwe, for example, it is a bit of a stretch to say it is less democratic than some of the sheikhdoms of the Gulf. But none of the sheikdoms has a problem visiting Europe.&quot;- Meles Zenawi&#x27;s response about European sanctions and travel ban on Zimbabwe&#x27;s Mugabe
*&quot;If it is presumed that the Kenyans will democratise in order to eat the peanuts of development assistance from the European Union... it would be a big mistake&quot;- Meles Zenawi&#x27;s reaction to European threat of sanctions on Kenya.
*&quot;Democracy is the expression of a sovereign people. To impose it from outside is inherently undemocratic.&quot;- Meles interviewed by The Guardian
*&quot;It&#x27;s true we have our disagreements on border issues, we have disagreements on trade and related issues, but you don&#x27;t go invading a country whenever you have a dispute on trade issues, ... We have more civilized mechanisms on resolving such problems.&quot; – after Eritrea&#x27;s attack on Mekele, Ethiopia
*&quot;America didn&#x27;t give us any money because of Somalia intervention. This doesn&#x27;t mean America hasn&#x27;t given us food aid or money for HIV prevention before. It certainly has. But we aren&#x27;t going to fight Somalia using Condoms.&quot; – Meles&#x27;s reply to MP Bulcha Demeksa&#x27;s teasing question on whether America gave financial support to Ethiopia for the Somalia intervention.
*&quot;This is not your run-of-the-mill demonstration. This is an Orange Revolution gone wrong&quot; – PM Meles accusing opposition parties of the violence.
*&quot;I have never heard of any convincing reason as to why we should privatize land at this stage.&quot; Part of PM Meles&#x27; controversial reply to Dr. Abdul Mejid Hussien.
*&quot;The violence has marred the image of Ethiopia... The worst is clearly behind us and we do not expect any such violence in the near future.&quot;—on post-election events
*&quot;Even when we obey international laws after exhausting all peaceful means, some countries might not support our move to defend Ethiopia because of their own national interests or diplomatic rationale. So what do we do? Two choices: either we seat &amp; welcome our enemies to invade our homes or we stand up for ourselves. I hope parliament chooses the second option...we don&#x27;t need the blessing of other nations to defend our country.&quot;—Meles speaking to parliament about Somali Islamic courts. (from amharic translation)
*&quot;I am proud to be an Ethiopian. I am proud to be a part of that history.&quot;—Meles speaking to American intellectuals about Ethiopia and its history.
*&quot;When they (Somali Jihadists) control the whole of Somalia it would be very naive to assume that they will mend their ways, cease to be terrorists and become very civilized and very tame pussycats.&quot;—Interview with AP on Somali extremists.
*&quot;As we respond to the assault of our enemy and defend our country, we must never break international laws. Crime can not be solved by more crime.&quot; – Meles Zenawi speaking to Parliament 23 November 2006.
*&quot;We believe the problem between ourselves and Eritrea will have to be resolved through dialogue, but it takes two to tango&quot;—on border dispute with Eritrea
*&quot;The rest of the contextual factors have no relevance whatsoever to the investigative process. Indeed, they remind me of the famous Tina Turner song. &#x27;What&#x27;s love got to do with it?&#x27;&quot;—Meles Zenawi&#x27;s response to EU-EOM implying Mrs. Ana Gomez&#x27;s alleged contradicting accusations.
*&quot;So why don&#x27;t you give them additional concessions?&#x27; We said, &#x27;What concessions? Concessions from our sovereignty? That has never been done by any government in Ethiopia in 3,000 years.&#x27; That is the only thing of great value what we have inherited from our past, our unflinching determination to keep our...country independent even if we are dying of hunger.&quot;—Response to EU&#x27;s demands for Eritrea
*&quot;While they are entitled to their own opinion, this government and this country are incapable, unwilling, and unable to be run like some banana republic from Capitol Hill. It is very worrisome that some of these individuals appear to have entertained such views.&quot;—In response to Rep. Donald Payne&#x27;s pressure for Hailu Shawel &amp; Co.

<doc id="393819" wikidata="Q776722" url="?curid=393819" title="Sonny Landham">
<text>William M. &quot;Sonny&quot; Landham III (February 11, 1941 – August 17, 2017) was an American actor. He portrayed Billy Bear in &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; (1982), tracker Billy Sole in &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), and &#x27;Chink&#x27; Weber in &quot;Lock Up&quot; (1989).
==Early life and education==
Landham was born February 11, 1941, in Canton, Georgia, and raised in Rome, Georgia. He was half Cherokee descent, one-eighth Seminole descent, and speculated the rest as German, English, and Irish descent. He also stated he had Jewish heritage. Landham had at least one sibling, a sister, Dawn.

He attended Saint Mary&#x27;s Catholic School and Darlington School before playing football for a year at the University of Georgia. Subsequently, he transferred to and graduated from Oglethorpe University. After college, he did a stint in the U.S. Army, worked in an oil field, as an ordained Baptist minister, and a model.

==Career==
===Acting career===
Landham studied acting for two years at Pasadena Playhouse before moving to New York in 1968 to pursue a career in acting. At the beginning of his acting career, Landham was an actor in pornographic films for financial reasons. He also posed for nude layout for &quot;Playgirl&quot;. He then became a mainstream movie actor and appeared in a number of Hollywood films, including &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1979) as a subway policeman whose leg gets broken by a baseball bat-wielding Michael Beck, &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; (1982), &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), &quot;Action Jackson&quot; (1988), and &quot;Lock Up&quot; (1989).

===Politics===
In 2003, Landham ran in the Republican Party primary election for the post of Governor of Kentucky, hoping to repeat the success of his &quot;Predator&quot; castmates Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He based his candidacy on opposition to an amendment which endorsed the Kentucky Family Court, saying his bad experiences at the hands of the family court had convinced him it was for the benefit of lawyers rather than families or children. He was unsuccessful in gaining the party&#x27;s nomination. He ran briefly as an independent candidate, but withdrew on June 18, 2003, and endorsed the Republican slate.

In January 2004, Landham announced his candidacy for the 27th State Senate District of Kentucky. That year he was the keynote speaker at the official launch party of the radio show, &quot;The Political Cesspool&quot;. In 2005, Landham spoke at the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC) convention.

On June 25, 2008, Landham announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat held by Mitch McConnell, as a Libertarian.

On July 23, 2008, Landham appeared on the political radio show &quot;The Weekly Filibuster&quot;, where he was asked, in relation to past comments of his quoted in the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot;, if he was calling for the genocide of Arab people. He replied, &quot;I call for outright bombing them back into the sand until they surrender and if they don&#x27;t surrender, then you continue the war. Because if you don&#x27;t, you will never have peace in the United States. Now do you want peace in the United States or do you want to live to some utopian ideals that are impossible in a world?&quot; He further called for Arabs to be banned from entering the United States, and referred to that ethnic group as &quot;camel dung-shovelers&quot;, and when questioned on this, suggested using the epithets &quot;rag-heads&quot; and &quot;camel jockeys&quot;. On July 28, the Kentucky Libertarian Party asked Landham to withdraw his nomination, citing those comments and explaining that his politics did not agree with their platform and values.

==Personal life==
Landham was married five times. He had four children, including a son named William, and a daughter named Priscilla.

After being convicted on federal charges of making threatening and obscene phone calls to his wife, Landham spent three years in prison. However the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the conviction in May 2001.

==Death==
Landham died on August 17, 2017, aged 76, from congestive heart failure.

<doc id="393824" wikidata="Q155390" url="?curid=393824" title="Costas Simitis">
<text>Konstantinos G. Simitis (; 23 June 1936 – 5 January 2025) was a Greek politician who led the &#x27;Modernization&#x27; movement of Greece . He succeeded in leadership Andreas Papandreou, the founder of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), and served as Prime Minister of Greece from 1996 to 2004.

Simitis was a founding member of PASOK, and he gained significant ministerial experience in Papandreou&#x27;s governments. Simitis&#x27; reputation was marked when he became Minister of National Economy in 1985 when PASOK&#x27;s profligacy needed a new financial &#x27;stability&#x27; imposed through an economic adjustment programme. With stability achieved and the party&#x27;s popularity waning, Papandreou distanced himself from Simitis&#x27; policies, and Simitis resigned. 

In 1996, Simitis won the leadership of PASOK after Papandreou&#x27;s failing health. However, the leadership transition from Papandreou to Simitis was confrontational by loyalists of the former Prime Minister, who wanted to prevent such a transition from being realized. Simitis lacked his predecessor&#x27;s charisma, and the fractured party&#x27;s support limited many of his actions in government. However, by the end of his tenure in 2004, Simitis had several significant achievements and reforms in the wider society and economy to proclaim. After two decades of the exuberant rhetoric of Simitis’ predecessors and financial stagnation, the Greek economy was put in order and became one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe, with an average annual increase of 4.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). The performance of the Greek economy under Simitis sealed the Greek entry into the Euro currency, closing the journey of aligning Greece with the West, which started with Eleftherios Venizelos and continued with Constantine Karamanlis. Simitis also succeeded in the Cypriot accession into the EU, a diplomatic priority for Greece. The successful completion of the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics also boosted Greece&#x27;s positive image as a modern state capable of undertaking sophisticated tasks. Moreover, a variety of large-scale infrastructure projects were completed, like the new Eleftherios Venizelos airport, the Athens Ring road, Athens Metro, and Rio–Antirrio Bridge. New institutions were also introduced, such as the Greek Ombudsman and several regulatory bodies to supervise market liberalization.

After the debt crisis erupted in Greece in 2009, the legacy of Simitis was re-interpreted by critics as insufficient or misleading. However, government institutions under Simitis were developed and strengthened in their capacity to reform, appearing both more &#x27;modern&#x27; and &#x27;European.&#x27;

== Biography ==
Costas Simitis was born in Piraeus to Georgios Simitis, a Professor at the School of Economic and Commercial Sciences who later became a member of the National Liberation Front government in World War II, and to his wife Fani (née Christopoulou). He studied law at the University of Marburg in Germany and economics at the London School of Economics. He was married to Daphne Arkadiou (b. 1938) and had two daughters, Fiona and Marilena. He resided in the Kolonaki district of Athens. His brother Spiros Simitis was a prominent jurist specializing in data privacy in Germany.

=== Political activity before 1981 ===
In 1965, he returned to Greece and was one of the founders of the &quot;Alexandros Papanastasiou&quot; political research group. In 1967, after the military coup on 21 April, this group was transformed into Democratic Defense, an organization opposed to the military regime. Simitis fled abroad after planting bombs in the streets of Athens (in later years, he acknowledged his activities on the Greek MEGA TV channel) in order to avoid being jailed and became a member of the Panhellenic Liberation Movement (PAK), led by Andreas Papandreou. He also took up a position as a university lecturer in Germany. He returned to Athens in 1974 and was one of the co-founders of PAK&#x27;s successor, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). In 1977, he took up a lecturer&#x27;s post at the Panteion University.

=== Ministerial offices ===
Simitis was not a candidate for the Greek Parliament in the 1981 elections, but he was appointed Minister of Agriculture in the first PASOK government of that year. Following the 1985 elections and his election as a deputy to the Parliament, he became Minister of National Economy; he undertook an unpopular stabilization program, trying to curb inflation and reduce deficits, but resigned his post in 1987 because he felt that his policies were being undermined. In 1993, he took over the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, but in 1995, he again resigned from the ministry and the party&#x27;s Executive Bureau following a public rebuke he received from Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.

=== Rise to the offices of Prime Minister and President of PASOK ===
On 16 January 1996, Papandreou resigned as Prime Minister due to ill health. In a special election held by the party&#x27;s parliamentary group on 18 January, Simitis was elected in his place over the candidacies of Akis Tsochatzopoulos, Gerasimos Arsenis and Ioannis Charalambopoulos. Papandreou, however, remained Chairman of the party for the next months until his death on 23 June (also Simitis&#x27; 60th birthday), just before a party conference would select the party&#x27;s vice-president; after Papandreou&#x27;s death, the conference would elect the new Party President. Simitis was elected in PASOK&#x27;s Fourth Congress on 30 June, defeating Akis Tsochatzopoulos on a platform of support for the European Union.

Simitis then led the party in the national elections of 22 September 1996, gaining a mandate in his own right. He also narrowly won the national election of 2000. He worked very closely and had a good relationship with his Cabinet Secretary of eight years, Sokratis Kosmidis. Although he is widely respected throughout Europe, in Greece, Simitis was regarded by some Greeks as a rather dull technocrat, lacking the charisma of Papandreou.

On 7 January 2004, with PASOK&#x27;s popularity collapsing, Simitis announced that he would resign as party president and would not stand for re-election as Prime Minister in the forthcoming legislative elections. At the time, he was accused of bowing out to avoid humiliation at the polls. However, by the end of his tenure on 10 March, he would be in office for over eight consecutive years, the longest continuous term in modern Greek history. In a past interview, Simitis had already stated that he would remain prime minister for only two legislative periods since &quot;he wanted to do other things in his life as well.&quot; On 8 January, he called elections for the party president to be held on 8 February. Simitis was succeeded as PASOK leader by the then-Minister of Foreign Affairs George Papandreou, the only candidate in these elections. Despite Papandreou&#x27;s personal popularity, PASOK lost the 7 March elections to the conservative New Democracy party, whose leader Kostas Karamanlis succeeded Simitis in the office of Prime Minister.

=== Political activity after 2004 ===
After the 2004 electoral defeat, Simitis remained a Member of the Hellenic Parliament for Piraeus, sitting on the Standing Committee on National Defence and Foreign Affairs. Re-elected in September 2007, he entered into a conflict with his successor as PASOK leader, George Papandreou, on the political choices of the party. In June 2008, he was excluded from the PASOK parliamentary group after opposing Papandreou&#x27;s position in favour of a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, which he had helped to draft as member of the Amato Group. Though never formally excluded from the party, he kept his distance with the leadership and could not come to terms with Papandreou in time to be a candidate for the 2009 elections, upon which he definitively left his MP seat for Piraeus. Before his departure, he warned of financial mismanagement that would lead to a harsh austerity regime in Greece imposed by the International Monetary Fund, which eventually came the following year.

=== Death===
Simitis was found unconscious at his holiday home in Corinth, Greece on 5 January 2025. He was taken to a hospital, where he died hours later, aged 88. The government declared four days of official mourning and accorded Simitis a state funeral, which was held at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens on 9 January. He was then buried at the First Cemetery of Athens.

== Policies and legacy ==

=== Social policies ===

Various social reforms were carried out under Simitis. EKAS, an income-tested pension supplement that restored the link of minimum pension with 20 daily minimum wages, was introduced, while the pension replacement rate was set as 70% of the last five years of salaries. Seniority pensions were also introduced, along with a contributory pension scheme for farmers. 
Law 2738/1999 on &quot;collective bargaining in the public administration, permanent status for workers employed under open-ended contracts and other provisions&quot; laid down, for the first time, &quot;the right of public servants to negotiate their terms and conditions of employment, excluding pay and pensions, and to conclude collective agreements.&quot; Law 2874/2000 on &#x27;Employment regulations and other provisions,&#x27; in addition to working time arrangements, &quot; regulates a range of important issues relating to labour relations, such as overtime, redundancies and matters involving leave,&quot; while Law 2839/2000 on &#x27;Regulation of matters regarding the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Public Administration and Decentralisation and other provisions&#x27; established a gender quota system in the public sector&#x27;s various governing councils, administrative boards and collective bodies. In 2003, a substantial level of legislative activity relating to employment, workplace health and safety and social security took place.

=== Financial policies ===
Simitis is known mainly in Greece for his political philosophy, known as &quot;Eksynchronismos&quot; (&quot;Modernization&quot;), which focused on extensive public investment and infrastructure works as well as economic and labor reforms. His supporters credit Simitis with overcoming the chronic problems of the Greek economy and thus achieving Greece&#x27;s admittance into the Eurozone. During his governance, official data presented inflation as having decreased from 15% to 3%, public deficits diminished from 14% to 3%, GDP increased at an annual average of 4%, and factual labor incomes increased at 3% per year. However, the macroeconomic data presented by Simitis&#x27; government were called into question by an audit performed by the successor government of New Democracy in 2004.

Many large-scale infrastructure projects were carried out or begun during the so-called &#x27;era of Eksychronismos&#x27;, such as the new &quot;Eleftherios Venizelos&quot; Athens International Airport, the Rio-Antirio bridge, the Athens Metro and the A2 motorway (Egnatia Odos).

=== Internal issues ===
In 2000, Simitis was embroiled in a dispute with the Archbishop of the influential Greek Orthodox Church, Christodoulos of Athens, when the Greek government sought to remove the &quot;Religion&quot; field from the national ID cards carried by Greek citizens on the grounds that the Hellenic Data Protection Authority recommended so; its decision also included the &quot;Nationality&quot; field, but was not implemented following a subsequent EE directive to the contrary. Christodoulos opposed the decision, claiming that the action pursued deviously the religious de-identification of the Greek nation. Faced with the government&#x27;s robust but unpopular stance, he organized two massive demonstrations in Athens and Thessaloniki alongside a majority of bishops of the Church of Greece. Simitis&#x27;s attitude gained faint-hearted support even within his party, but he found a surprisingly militant ally in the &quot;Eksychronismos&quot; opinion makers. Kostas Karamanlis, the opposition leader, signed a petition, organized by the Church of Greece, calling for a referendum on the matter and signed, too, by more than three million citizens. However, the inclusion of religious beliefs on ID cards, even on a voluntary basis, as the Church had asked, was deemed unconstitutional by the Greek courts.

=== Foreign policy ===

While PASOK traditionalists disliked his move away from the more traditional/orthodox norms of the Democratic socialism of Andreas Papandreou&#x27; policies, and also his relative moderation on issues such as the Cyprus dispute and the Macedonia naming dispute, his supporters saw both of these as positive elements of the &quot;eksynchronismos&quot; movement that Simitis was seen as spearheading.

During January–June 2003, Simitis, as Greek Prime Minister, exercised the presidency of the European Council.

===Controversy and criticism===
In 1996, the appointment of the PASOK-leaning &quot;To Vima&quot; newspaper editor, Stavros Psycharis, as political administrator of Mount Athos was particularly criticized by the opposition.

====Siemens bribery scandal====

A significant issue during Simitis&#x27; tenure concerned corruption, which became endemic in Greek public life (including the Siemens Greek bribery scandal, incidents like Akis Tsochatzopoulos, who later was imprisoned for criminal actions for the purchase of the German type 214 submarines) etc.

Siemens CEO Michalis Christoforakos testified that during his trial in Germany, he bribed (2%) both the two major political parties, ND and PASOK (through Geitonas and Tsoukatos, partner of Kostas Simitis). According to Tsoukatos, the money was put in PASOK&#x27;s cash desk. As of 2018, Simitis was under prosecutor investigation regarding the Siemens Greek bribery scandal, but was later exonerated.

==== Validity of statistical data====

New Democracy revised the size of the defense expenditures for the years 1997-2003 by changing the regulation for the cost accounting of the defense expenditures from the date of delivery of war material (delivery basis), which was at the time followed by half the countries of the EU, to the payment date of the advance payments (cash basis). Eurostat accepted the change, because of the lack of reliable data for the deliveries of war material. By the revision of the 1999 defense expenditures, the deficit of 1999, the year of the Greek economy&#x27;s evaluation, amounted to 3.1%. Since 2005, Eurostat changed its rules and records the defense expenditures according to the delivery date for all the countries of the EU, including Greece. Eurostat requested that the member countries to correct their data retroactively. Greece did not proceed to the rectification.

The deficit of 1999, year of the Greek economy&#x27;s evaluation, is still presented to be 3.1% of the Gross National product (GNP), greater than the Maastricht criterion for a deficit lower than 3% of the GNP. Subsequent revisions of the data show also other countries exceeding the fiscal deficit (government deficit) of 3% during the evaluation period. Thus, in 1997, which is the year of the evaluation of the first countries that became members of the Euro zone, the deficit of France was 3.3%, of Spain 3.4% and of Portugal 3.4%.

====Other====
Other points of criticism included the 1999 Greek stock market crash in the Athens Exchange, such as his handling on the Abdullah Öcalan&#x27;s capture and the Imia incident regarding the foreign relations with Turkey.

Simitis rejected New Democracy&#x27;s bills for accountability and transparency with regards to governmental expenditure and decisions, while New Democracy leader Kostas Karamanlis accused Simitis during a parliamentary plenum of being an &quot;archpriest of cronyism&quot;, referencing the index of the NGO Transparency International. However, Greece&#x27;s position has fallen by five places in the same index during the New Democracy government (2004-2009). Four years later Karamanlis himself admitted that he exaggerated and that he never doubted Simitis&#x27; personal integrity.

<text>Saufatu Sopoanga (22 February 1952 – 15 December 2020) was a Tuvaluan politician who served as the eighth prime minister of Tuvalu from 2 August 2002 to 27 August 2004. He drew international attention for his speeches warning about the effects of the rising sea level on Tuvalu and other low-lying island countries.

He later served as Deputy Prime Minister from 2004 to 2006. His younger brother Enele Sopoaga served as Prime Minister of Tuvalu from 2013 to 2019.

==Early life and career==
Sopoanga was born on Nukufetau Atoll on 22 February 1952. He received a diploma in development administration from South Devon Technical College, Torquay in 1978 and a postgraduate diploma from the University of Manchester in 1992. In 1993, he received a Master&#x27;s degree from the University of Liverpool. 

Sopoanga began working in the civil service of the Ellice Islands in 1973, and was a permanent secretary for different ministries between 1975 and 1995. During his time at the Ministry of Natural Resources, he facilitated visits by foreign geologists after Tuvalu became a member of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in 1984. From 1996 until his retirement in October 2000, he was a state secretary, the highest rank in the civil service. 

The Electoral Provisions (Parliament) Act of Tuvalu was amended in May 2000 to increase the membership of parliament from 12 to 15 MPs. Sopoanga was elected as a member of the Parliament of Tuvalu for the constituency of Nukufetau, in a special election in November 2000, (together with Amasone Kilei and Namoto Kelisiano) and they attended their first parliamentary session on 7 December 2000. He became a Special Ministerial Adviser in the Ministry of Works, Communications &amp; Transport to the government of Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana. Under prime minister Koloa Talake, he served as the minister for finance, economic planning and industry.

==Prime Minister of Tuvalu==
Sopoanga was elected Prime Minister of Tuvalu by the Parliament of Tuvalu on 2 August 2002 after the general election. He also held the foreign affairs and labour portfolios.

After being elected Prime Minister, Sopoanga announced his intention to create a plan to improve education and healthcare in Tuvalu. He attended a United Nations Sustainable Development summit in Johannesburg in September 2002, where he warned that Tuvalu would be completely submerged in 50 years due to global warming-related increases in sea level. On 24 September 2003, Sopoanga delivered a speech to the United Nations General Assembly which outlined issues facing Tuvalu on its 25th anniversary of independence, such as economic underdevelopment. He called climate change &quot;a slow and insidious form of terrorism&quot; against Tuvalu.

As Tuvalu&#x27;s parliament is nonpartisan, both Sapoanga&#x27;s government and the opposition experienced periodic defections and uncertain by-elections. Due to this instability, Sopoanga personally voiced support for making Tuvalu a republic with a directly-elected head of government.

The Sopoanga government first lost its majority in May 2003, following the results of the 2003 Nanumea by-election and the 2003 Niutao by-election. As Sopoanga did not call parliament afterward, opposition leader Amasone Kilei filed a case on 20 June 2003 with the High Court of Tuvalu seeking orders regarding the appointment of a speaker and the calling of parliament. The governor-general had already issued a notice on 19 June ordering the election of a speaker, which was won by opposition MP Faimalaga Luka. On 6 August 2003, the Chief Justice of the High Court issued his decision on the case: he declined to force the prime minister&#x27;s resignation, and deferred the decision to call parliament to the governor general&#x27;s reserve powers as defined under Section 116(1) of the Constitution of Tuvalu.

Sopoanga finally recalled parliament to meet in September. On 9 September, he nominated the new Speaker Faimalaga Luka as the next governor general, triggering the 2003 Nukufetau by-election in October. Elisala Pita won the by-election and joined the government&#x27;s benches, restoring its majority.

On 25 August 2004, Sopoanga resigned as prime minister after a no confidence motion carried in parliament, 8–6. One of the government members was sick in New Zealand, and the Speaker Otinielu Tausi voted with the opposition due to a disagreement over Sopoanga&#x27;s financial policies.

==Later career==

After resigning as prime minister, Sopoanga resigned his seat in parliament to delay the election of a new prime minister, as the Constitution required all fifteen MPs to vote. The 2004 Nukufetau by-election was held on 7 October, and Sopoanga regained his seat. However, Maatia Toafa was elected prime minister on 11 October 2004, 8–7. Sopoanga then became deputy prime minister, also holding the Works, Communications &amp; Transport portfolio. At the 2006 Tuvaluan general election, Sopoanga lost his seat in Parliament.

After leaving parliament, Sopoanga served as Chairman of various organizations, such as the Tuvalu National Private Sector Organization and the Public Service Commission. He was also the Secretary-General of the Tuvalu Red Cross. In 2018, he became a member of Tuvalu&#x27;s Memory of the World Committee.

== Personal life ==
Sopoanga had several brothers; his younger brother Enele was also Prime Minister from 2013 to 2019. Sopoanga and his wife Filifau had four children.

=== Death ===
Sopoanga died on 15 December 2020 in Tuvalu. He received a state funeral on 22 December 2020.

== Honours ==

* Officer, Order of the British Empire (OBE), 1998 Birthday Honours

<doc id="393831" wikidata="Q238670" url="?curid=393831" title="Otmar Hasler">
<text>Otmar Hasler (; born 28 September 1953) is a former politician from Liechtenstein who served as Prime Minister of Liechtenstein from 2001 to 2009. He was previously the President of the Landtag of Liechtenstein in 1995 and served in the Landtag of Liechtenstein from 1989 to 2001.

==Early life and career==

Hasler attended school in Eschen from 1966 to 1969 and then teacher training college in Rickenbach, Schwyz from 1969 to 1974. He was educated in secondary school teaching from 1975 to 1979 at the University of Freiburg and University of Burgundy. He worked as a teacher at the secondary school in Eschen from 1979 to 2001.

Hasler was elected to the Landtag of Liechtenstein in 1989 as a member of the Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party, where he served until 2001. He was President of the Landtag of Liechtenstein from January to December 1995. In addition, he was president of the Progressive Citizens&#x27; Party from 1993 to 1995. 

==Prime Minister of Liechtenstein==
Hasler was Prime Minister of Liechtenstein from 5 April 2001 to 25 May 2009. His first term oversaw a FBP majority government, whereas in his second term he led a new coalition government with the Patriotic Union.

His government oversaw the ending of the 1999–2001 Liechtenstein financial crisis, with Liechtenstein being removed from the Financial Action Task Force on 23 June 2001.

In 2003, a referendum to adopt Hans-Adam II&#x27;s revision of the constitution of Liechtenstein to expand his powers passed. The prince had threatened to abdicate and leave the country if the referendum did not result in his favour. In the run-up to the referendum, Hasler supported the proposed changes.

=== 2008 tax affair ===
During Hasler&#x27;s term, the 2008 Liechtenstein tax affair took place, where millions of euros belonging to hundreds of citizens living in Germany were channeled into the LGT Bank and other banks in Liechtenstein, taking advantage of Liechtenstein-based trusts to evade paying taxes in Germany. The affair overshadowed the previously-planned visit of Hasler to Berlin on 19 February 2008 to meet with the minister of finance, Peer Steinbrück, and the chancellor, Angela Merkel. Merkel asked for help in the investigation and cooperation in prevention of tax evasion, pointing out that Liechtenstein provided the US Internal Revenue Service with some data but not the German Ministry of Finances.

The newspaper &quot;Die Welt&quot; described the event as a &quot;government crisis&quot;. As a result of the affair, Hasler&#x27;s government entered negotiations with a number of countries to discuss tax avoidance issues. It reached an agreement with the United Kingdom in 2009 that will allow the about 5,000 British customers of Liechtenstein&#x27;s banks that hold for them about £2-3 billion in secret accounts to come clear with British tax authorities under terms of a significantly reduced penalty. The agreement opened up Liechtenstein&#x27;s banks to greater transparency, but remains controversial in Liechtenstein; some banks feared that clients would move their money elsewhere.

Hasler sought re-election for a third term in the 2009 Liechtenstein general election. However, the election resulted in a victory for the Patriotic Union and Hasler resigned as prime minister on 8 February 2009, and was succeeded by Klaus Tschütscher on 25 March.

== Later life ==
Hasler currently serves as a member of the board at the Kaiser Partner Privatbank in Vaduz.

In 2023, Hasler was a co-founder and board member of the &quot;Liacht&quot; foundation, designed to financially support charitable organisations. He has been a board member of the organisation since.

<doc id="393833" wikidata="Q140144" url="?curid=393833" title="Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali">
<text>Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali (; 1 January 1944 – 2 December 2020) was a Pakistani politician who served as the 15th prime minister of Pakistan from 2002 until his resignation in 2004. He was the first and only elected prime minister from Balochistan, Pakistan.

Originally a supporter of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Jamali emerged from the politics of Balochistan under military governor Rahimuddin Khan during the 1970s. He became a national figure as part of the government of Nawaz Sharif, and was Chief Minister of Balochistan for two non-consecutive terms (from June–December 1988 and November 1996 –February 1997). Although he was a senior leader in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) and Sharif&#x27;s confidant, relations between Jamali and Sharif cooled and Jamali joined the Pakistan Muslim League (Q) after the 1999 coup led by General Pervez Musharraf. In the 2002 general election, Jamali won his bid for the office of Prime Minister after his supporters and colleagues crossed party lines to support him. On 21 November 2002 Jamali was appointed the 13th Prime Minister of Pakistan-designate. He took the oath on 23 November 2002, serving until he unexpectedly announced his resignation in 2004. He is the fifth shortest-serving democratically elected Prime Minister in the history of Pakistan.

==Early life and education==
Jamali was born on 1 January 1944 to a political, religious&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews/29oct2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and landlord family in Rojhan village of Commissariat Baluchistan of the British Indian Empire, now Jaffarabad District in Balochistan, Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;newslinemagazine/dec2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamali received his early education at Lawrence College, Murree and A-levels from Aitchison College, Lahore. Jamali was a great hockey player in his time. He then studied in a government college for a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He received his master&#x27;s degree in political science at the University of the Punjab in 1965.

==Political career==
Jamali began his political career in 1970 and joined PPP. Jamali took part in 1970 Pakistani general election for the first time but lost it.

He was elected to the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan in 1977 Pakistani general election on a PPP ticket. He was appointed a provincial minister in the provincial cabinet of Nawab Mohammad Khan Barozai in Balochistan. He briefly held portfolios for the departments of Food, Information, Law and Parliamentary Affairs.

After the imposition of martial law in Pakistan by General Zia-ul-Haq, he was allied to Zia-ul-Haq.

Jamali was appointed as a state minister in the federal cabinet by General Zia-ul-Haq.

Jamali was elected as the member of the National Assembly of Pakistan in 1985 Pakistani general election from Naseerabad constituency and was inducted into the federal cabinet of Junejo and given the portfolio of Federal Minister of water and power.

Jamali was appointed as the caretaker Chief Minister of Balochistan in 1988 after General Zia-ul-Haq dismissed the government of Junejo.

Jamali was re-elected as the member of the provincial assembly of Balochistan in 1988 Pakistani general election and became the chief minister of Balochistan.

He was elected as the member of the Senate of Pakistan in 1994 and again in 1997.

Jamali ran for the seat of National Assembly in the 1990 Pakistani general elections, but was defeated by a PPP candidate.

He was re-elected as the member of the Provincial Assembly in 1993 Pakistani general elections on the PML ticket and defeated a PPP nominee. Jamali was re-appointed caretaker as the chief minister of Balochistan in 1997.

==Prime Minister of Pakistan==
In July 2002, Jamali joined the Pakistan Muslim League&#x27;s breakaway Pakistan Muslim League (Q).

He was re-elected as the member of the National Assembly of Pakistan in 2002 Pakistani general election.

In November 2002, Jamali became the 13th Prime Minister of Pakistan by a simple majority for five years for the first time after securing 188 votes out of 342 seats in the National Assembly of Pakistan. He was the first politician from Balochistan to become prime minister of Pakistan.

Since no party had an exclusive mandate, his election as Prime Minister followed weeks of negotiation. He formed a coalition government with MQM, MMA, PPPP and the splinter group of the Pakistan Muslim League. He oversaw Pakistan&#x27;s transition from two-party to multi-party democracy.

===Foreign policy===
In 2004, Jamali visited Afghanistan, which was the first highest-level visit from Pakistan since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001 which was an ally of Pakistan. Jamali supported Hamid Karzai as President of Afghanistan and assured him of cooperation between the government of both countries in everything, from trade to terrorism. Jamali announced donations of 300 buses and trucks, scholarships for Afghan students and aid for improvement of road, railway and hospital projects in Afghanistan.

In October 2003 Jamali visited the United States, meeting with President George W. Bush and vowing to support the U.S. in the war on terror.

Jamali vowed to improve relations with India immediately after assuming office and procuring a peace agreement and cease-fire in the disputed Kashmir region. He appointed a special envoy to improve relations and lessen tensions between the two countries which had arisen during the 1990s and early 2000s.

===Resignation===
In June 2004, Jamali abruptly announced his resignation on television after a three-hour meeting with Musharraf. There had been rumours of Jamali&#x27;s strained relationship with Musharraf on the execution of government policies. According to media reports, resignation became inevitable when Musharraf became unhappy with Jamali&#x27;s performance and his failure to strongly endorse Musharraf&#x27;s policies.

The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal was initially surprised; the mainstream parties saw Jamali&#x27;s resignation as &quot;forced and [a] humiliation for democracy&quot; and &quot;bad for the future&quot;. With his surprise announcement, Jamali dissolved the cabinet and nominated his party&#x27;s president Shujaat Hussain as interim prime minister. Weeks after his resignation, it was learned that it came as the result of deteriorating relations with Hussain.

==Post-prime ministership==
After resigning, Jamali pursued his passion for field hockey. In 2004, he became president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation and vowed to solve the problems facing the Pakistan Hockey Federation and revive the Pakistan men&#x27;s national field hockey team. He previously played for Punjab province, acted as Chief-de-Mission for the 1984 Summer Olympics and was chief selector for the national team.

In 2008, he resigned as its president after the national hockey team performed poorly at the Olympic Games.

In May 2013, he joined the Pakistan Muslim League (N). He remained a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 2013 until his resignation in May 2018.

In June 2018, he quit PML-N and joined Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.

==Death==
On 29 November 2020, Jamali was admitted to Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology and put on a ventilator after suffering a cardiac arrest. He died in Rawalpindi on 2 December 2020 at the age of 76. On 3 December 2020, after funeral prayers, Jamali was laid to rest in his native village.

<doc id="393834" wikidata="Q118537" url="?curid=393834" title="Japan Trench">
<text>The Japan Trench is an oceanic trench part of the Pacific Ring of Fire off northeast Japan. It extends from the Kuril Islands to the northern end of the Izu Islands, and is at its deepest. It links the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench to the north and the Izu–Ogasawara Trench to its south with a length of . This trench is created as the oceanic Pacific plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk microplate (a microplate formerly a part of the North American plate). The subduction process causes bending of the down going plate, creating a deep trench. Continuing movement on the subduction zone associated with the Japan Trench is one of the main causes of tsunamis and earthquakes in northern Japan, including the megathrust Tōhoku earthquake and resulting tsunami that occurred on 11 March 2011. The rate of subduction associated with the Japan Trench has been recorded at about /yr.

== Tectonic history ==
During the late Neogene period (23.03-2.58 million years ago), the Japan Trench underwent a period of plate convergence between the Pacific and Okhotsk plates. Based on the sediment sequence during this time, there appears to have been little net accretion of sediment onto the overlying plate as well as evidence of mild erosion at the base of the convergent margin.

During the Cretaceous (145.5-66 million years ago) to early Paleogene (66–23.03 ma), evidence of andesitic volcanism along with the development of a large syncline and a thickened sediment sequence indicate the possible development of a forearc basin. Activity during the Cretaceous included subduction events as well as extensive accretion of sediment to the Northeastern Japan Arc that continues today. Volcanism decreased during the early Paleogene (66 ma), exposing the thickened Cretaceous-Paleogene thick sediment sequence. Once this sediment sequence subsided, volcanism once again resumed.

== Seismicity ==
Seismic activity along the Japan Trench occurs along the associated subduction zone at disruptive convergent plate boundaries between the Okhotsk and subducting Pacific plate. The continuing movement along these plate boundaries occur at a depth of about .
===Seismic events===
During the year of 1896, a magnitude (M) 6.8 earthquake was recorded within the Japan Trench. Later during the same year, a destructive magnitude 8.5 earthquake occurred resulting in two tsunamis wreaking havoc.

A series of M7 earthquakes occurred at the Fukushima-oki region in 1938, registering five in total. The magnitudes were 7.4, 7.7, 7.8, 7.7 and 7.1.

During December 1994, transient crustal movements were recorded by a Global Positioning System (GPS) network after an inter-plate earthquake arose within the Japan Trench. This very subtle, but distinct disruption observed indicates a &quot;silent&quot; slow fault slip was triggered by this. A recorded magnitude 7.7 earthquake was recorded in Sanriku-oki that may have been triggered by the slow slip observed earlier.

Many other earthquakes have been recorded from interplate and transient postseismic slip data along the Japan Trench. Dates include August 2005, May 2008, July 2008, and March 2010 ranging in magnitudes 7.2, 7.0, 6.9, and 6.7 respectively. A characteristic earthquake (~M7) periodically occurred at a recurring interval rate of about 37 years. ~M7 earthquakes can be seen in the table to the right, occurring in the years 1938, 1989, 1992, 2005, 2008, 2008 and 2011.

Ocean bottom seismometers placed in the base of the Japan Trench measures the ground for any motion created by recording the seismic waves emitted. In 2012, the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) stationed in Tokyo started the construction of seismic and tsunami observation networks along the trench. They planned to layout 154 stations about apart, each equipped with an accelerometer to observe seismic changes and a water pressure gauge for tsunami observation.

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake===
On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake occurred on the subduction interface boundary of the Pacific plate sinking underneath Japan along the Japan Trench. A rupture within the central region of the trench spanning an area of about long and wide resulted here. It is considered as the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan as well as one of the four most powerful earthquakes ever recorded since the start of modern record-keeping in 1900. This megathrust earthquake caused giant tsunami waves to form which eventually caused destruction to the coastline of northern Japan. The damage left about 16,000 people killed along with a catastrophic level 7 nuclear meltdown of three nuclear reactors located at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex. The World&#x27;s Bank recorded the total cost of damage to be about US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in history.

===Surface roughness===
Large magnitude and frequent earthquake activity occurring at the northern Japan Trench may be explained by variations in surface roughness of the subducting Pacific plate. Regions of smooth ocean floor subduction are correlated with typically large under-thrust earthquakes within the deeper part of the plate interface zone. No earthquakes have been observed or reported from the shallow aseismic zone of the north Japan Trench. Regions of rough ocean bottom subduction are correlated with large normal faulting earthquakes within the outer-rise region, along with larger tsunami earthquakes occurring at the shallow region of the plate interface (megathrust events) .

== Ocean drilling ==
In 1980, lipids samples were taken via sediment cores located on both the landward and distal sides of the Japan Trench during six sections of the Deep Sea Drilling Project&#x27;s transect. They were analyzed using gas chromatography and computerized-gas chromatography-mass spectrometric data. Samples were identified to contain many components such as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, acids and other poly functional components. These components are considered as indicators for terrestrial, marine (non-bacterial), and bacterial inputs within the sediment of the Japan Trench.

Expedition 343 of the Japan Trench Fast Driling Project was conducted under the supervision and authority of the Japan Agency For Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). The drilling occurred during two periods; April 1 to May 24, 2012, and from July 5th-18th, 2012. Their main goal was to better understand the very large fault slip of that occurred during the Tohoku earthquake and its potential as one of the main triggers of tsunami wave formation occurring along the northeast coast of Japan.

In 2013, the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 343 collected sediment samples from drilling at the plate boundary fault zone along the Japan Trench. The sediment cores collected exhibited low friction at coseismic slip velocities as well as at low slip velocities. These studies and samples have supported the idea that these frictional properties of the fault zone possibly triggered the shallow and large slip during the Tohoku earthquake.

== Sediments ==

=== Turbidite paleoseismology ===
Sediment samples within the Japan Trench consist mainly of highly localized clay-rich material. The subducting Pacific plate creates basins along the ocean floor of the Japan Trench, accommodating the deposition of fine-grained turbidites and interseismic sediment deposits through turbidity currents. These turbidites preserve the sediment deposits as a geologic record of past large earthquakes by indicating the change in sediment deposition through sediment gravity flow. The small deep-sea basins with high sedimentation rates found along the Japan Trench pose favorable environmental conditions for the studying of turbidite paleoseismology.

=== Microbial activity ===
During an exploration to the Japan Trench on January 1, 1999, a sample of deep-sea sediment was taken from a depth of from the use of a pressure-retaining sediment sampler. Samples from the expedition showed that the microbial diversity displayed a wide distribution of types in the Bacteria domain. 16S ribosomal RNA genes were amplified through the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the nucleotides and identify the bacteria phylogenetically. Further analysis of fatty acids extracted from the same cultures further supported the phylogenetic results observed. The discovery of different bacterial domains in these sediments can be used as indicators for microbial diversity found within the Japan Trench.

==Exploration==

*In 1987, results from the French-Japanese Kaiko exploration program into the Japan Trench along with complementary data were used to create and propose a model of the subduction of seamount chains between the Japan and Kuril trenches as well as along the southern part of the Japan Trench.
*On 11 August 1989, the Shinkai 6500 three-person submersible descended to while exploring the Japan Trench.
*In October 2008, a UK-Japan team discovered a shoal of &quot;Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis&quot; snailfish at a depth of approximately in the trench. These were, at the time, the deepest living fish ever filmed. The record was surpassed by an unidentified type of snailfish filmed at a depth of in December 2014 in the Mariana Trench, and extended in May 2017 when another unidentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of in the Mariana Trench.
*On August 20, 2022, as part of a joint Caladan Oceanic / University of Western Australia / JAMSTEC expedition, the first manned dive to the trench&#x27;s bottom was made in the DSV Limiting Factor. The submersible pilot, explorer Victor Vescovo, and scientific mission specialist Prof. Hiroshi Kitazato of the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology descended to a maximum depth of 8,001 +/- 9 meters as indicated by multiple depth measurement devices mounted on the vehicle. Other sonar readings of the trench made by the expedition&#x27;s Kongsberg EM124 sonar indicated a maximum depth of up to 8,012 +/- 11 meters across its broad bottom plain.

<doc id="393836" wikidata="Q431515" url="?curid=393836" title="Mohamed Ghannouchi">
<text>Mohamed Ghannouchi ( &quot;Muhammad Al-Ghannushi&quot;; born 18 August 1941) is a Tunisian politician who was Prime Minister of Tunisia from 1999 to 2011. Regarded as a technocrat, Ghannouchi was a long-standing figure in the Tunisian government under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He also served as the President of Tunisia from 14 to 15 January 2011, holding the powers and duties of the office nominally for the absent President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who had fled the country due to the 2011 revolution. On 15 January 2011 the presidency was declared vacant by the Constitutional Court and Ben Ali&#x27;s term was officially terminated, leading to Speaker of Parliament Fouad Mebazaa taking office as Acting President. Ghannouchi stayed on as prime minister for six more weeks after Ben Ali&#x27;s overthrow before himself resigning.

==Political career==
Ghannouchi was a member of the Tunisian parliament for the Democratic Constitutional Rally. He was the Minister of Finance from 1989 to 1992. From 1992 to 1999, he served as Minister of International Co-operation and Foreign Investment, and from 1999 to 2011 he was the Prime Minister of Tunisia, making him the longest serving prime minister since the proclamation of independence, surpassing his predecessor Hamed Karoui.

After the fall of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on 14 January 2011 in the wake of the 2010–2011 Tunisian uprising, he was the self-proclaimed acting president of the country for a few hours starting on 14 January 2011, under Article 56 of the Constitution of Tunisia. He remained prime minister for six weeks before stepping down.

===WikiLeaks description===
In a 2006 diplomatic cable from the United States diplomatic cables leak, Ghannouchi was described as being generally popular among the population of Tunisia. Passport, a blog by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, gave a different view of Ghannouchi, saying he &quot;is not necessarily any more popular than Ben Ali, though he&#x27;s not nearly as tainted by the lurid tales of corruption and excess that so damaged the ruling family. But Tunisians certainly don&#x27;t respect the prime minister; they call him &#x27;Mr. Oui Oui&#x27; because he&#x27;s always saying yes to Ben Ali&quot;.

===Role following 2010–2011 Tunisian uprising===
On 14 January 2011, before Ben Ali had fled the country during the Tunisian Revolution, Ghannouchi announced that Ben Ali had called for parliamentary elections in six months, dismissed the government, and asked him to form a new government. During the evening, Ghannouchi announced that he was taking temporary control of the country on state television. Ghannouchi promised to begin discussing political and economic reforms the next day. Ghannouchi said he would hold new elections within sixty days, as required by the Tunisian Constitution. On January 15, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that some protesters were calling for Ghannouchi to step down. On that same day, it was announced that Congress Speaker Fouad Mebazaa was taking the post of Acting President of Tunisia.

Al Jazeera claimed that some lawyers disagreed with Ghannouchi&#x27;s claim to power, interpreting the constitution differently, in particular referring to Article 57.

Afterwards he resumed as prime minister and formed a new national unity government that included members of opposition parties, civil society representatives, and even a blogger, Slim Amamou, who only a week previously had been imprisoned by the regime of the deposed President.

Ghannouchi resigned his membership of the RCD on 18 January. His resignation was followed by similar actions from other RCD members within the government; but on 27 January, Ghannouchi carried out a major reshuffle of the government to remove most former RCD members other than himself.

After a new wave of protests, Ghannouchi resigned as PM on 27 February 2011. The current whereabouts of Ghannounchi to this day are unknown, but it is likely Ghannounchi is still residing in Tunisia with his family.

<doc id="393849" wikidata="Q324950" url="?curid=393849" title="Daniyal Akhmetov">
<text>Daniyal Kenjetaiuly Akhmetov (, &quot;Danial Kenjetaiūly Ahmetov&quot;; born 15 June 1954) is a Kazakh politician who was the 6th Prime Minister of Kazakhstan from 13 June 2003 to 9 January 2007.

Critics refer to him as &quot;The Terminator&quot;, a nickname he gained as the akim of Pavlodar Region for his actions in suppressing supporters of Galymzhan Zhakiyanov, the previous äkim. On 8 January 2007, he resigned as Prime Minister. He did not say why, but President Nursultan Nazarbayev had criticized him in 2006 for overspending and other administrative errors. Nazarbayev accepted his resignation, and immediately appointed him acting Prime Minister.

Akhmetov was included as Minister of Defense in the government that took office on 10 January 2007. He was dismissed from that post in June 2009. From November 11, 2014 to June 16, 2023, he was äkim of the East Kazakhstan Region.

==Early life and career==
Akhmetov was born in the city of Pavlodar in the Kazakh SSR. In 1976, he graduated from the Pavlodar State University with a degree in civil engineering.

After graduating, Akhmetov began his career as a foreman, then worked as a foreman at the housebuilding plant of the Pavlodarzhilstroy trust. In 1981, he became the deputy chief engineer at the construction site of the Ekibastuzshakhtastroy Combine. From 1983, he served as a deputy chairman of the executive committee of the Ekibastuz City Council of People&#x27;s Deputies. In 1991, Akhmetov became the manager of the EkibastuzEnergoZhilPromStroy trust.

== Early political career ==
From 1992, Akhmetov was head of the Ekibastuz City Administration and on 19 January 1993, he was appointed as the äkim of Pavlodar Region. He served that position before becoming the äkim of North Kazakhstan Region on 19 December 1997.

On 12 October 1999, Akhmetov was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan under Tokayev&#x27;s cabinet and from 21 December 2000, he served as the First Deputy Prime Minister. There, Akhmetov was in charge of industry, agriculture, transport and communications, migration and demographic policy. He was reappointed again as the äkim of Pavlodar region on 21 November 2001 after his predecessor Galymzhan Zhakiyanov was dismissed after joining the opposition by helping to form the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan.

== Prime Minister of Kazakhstan (2003–2006) ==
===Appointment===
President Nursultan Nazarbayev nominated Akhmetov as Prime Minister at a joint session of parliament on 13 June 2003. Nazarbayev gave a speech saying the PM needed to have experience in provincial government because the nation needed to speed up the pace of social and economic development. Akmetov was approved by 36 of 39 senators and 73 of 77 members of the Mazhilis to form the 28th government of Kazakhstan.

Akhmetov told the parliament he wanted continuity in policy despite the change in government, and said that Kazakhstan is &quot;building a state governed by the rule of law where everyone has the right to freedom of conscience and expression, but that everyone should work within the law.&quot; He said there should not be dissidence, only constructive dialogue and mutual understanding, and called for everyone to engage in presidential economic programs.

===Petroleum law changes===
Akhmetov worked to change Kazakhstan&#x27;s petroleum laws despite strong opposition from foreign companies. In May 2004, he received a letter from 47 foreign oil companies, including ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, Shell, the BG Group, and ENI, complaining that the proposed changes would negatively affect future investment. The companies specifically took issue with local content requirements, which were described as &quot;unnecessarily burdensome&quot; and that a requirement for KMG to own at least 50% of any development &quot;may not be advisable in all circumstances.&quot;

===Kazakhstan-South Korea relations===

Akhmetov met with South Korean Prime Minister Han Myeong Sook on 23 September 2006 in Astana and signed several bilateral agreements enhancing economic ties. The Government of South Korea agreed to invest an additional $2 billion in joint projects in the energy, uranium-extraction, construction, transportation, and banking sectors. Akhmetov offered South Korea the option of participating in developing a new type of nuclear reactor. South Korean investors have stakes in more than 300 Kazakhstan-based companies. Han invited Nazarbayev to visit South Korea in 2007. Han was in Kazakhstan until 24 September. She then traveled to Uzbekistan.

===Kazakhstan-Tatarstan relations===
Akhmetov met with Rustam Minnikhanov, the Prime Minister of the Autonomous Republic of Tatarstan, in Astana on 13 October 2006. They discussed creating a joint venture that would build helicopters, Kazakh government investment in petrochemical businesses in Tatarstan, and constructing a highway to western China that would connect St. Petersburg to Moscow, Kazan, Orenburg, Kyzylorda, Shymkent, and Korgas in Xinjiang, China. Akhmetov called the proposed highway &quot;the shortest road link between Europe and China.&quot; Iskender Muflikhanov, aide to Prime Minister Minnikhanov, said the Tatar government had &quot;great hopes with regard to the shipping, or the assembling [in Kazakhstan] of KamAZ trucks. Work in under way on this West-South highway project in Kazakhstan and, as a rule, our KamAZ trucks are irreplaceable for projects of that magnitude.&quot;

===2007 political shakeup===
Nazarbayev nominated Karim Massimov, who at the time served as Deputy PM, to succeed Akhmetov as PM on 9 January 2007. Akhmetov resigned on 8 January without explanation. Analysts attributed Akhmetov&#x27;s political downfall to the President&#x27;s criticism of his administrative oversight of the economy. The Parliament confirmed the nomination on 10 January. Akhmetov was appointed as Defense Minister, replacing Mukhtar Altynbayev.

== Post-Premiership ==
Akhmetov continued to serve as the Defense Minister under Massimov&#x27;s government until being relieved from his post on 17 June 2009. In December 2010, it was revealed that Akhmetov headed a company in the field of ecological energy and did not want to return to politics, KazTAG reported. According to the agency, Akhmetov was pleased with such changes in his life, since he began to spend more time with his family and friends. He also led a healthy lifestyle and was engaged in cycling. Akhmetov also denied rumors that he allegedly wanted to shoot himself after resignation.

On 21 December 2011, he was appointed a member of the Board for Energy and Infrastructure of the Eurasian Economic Commission.

From November 11, 2014 to June 16, 2023, he was äkim of the East Kazakhstan Region.

<text>Patrick Augustus Mervyn Manning (17 August 1946 – 2 July 2016) was a Trinidad and Tobago politician who was the fourth prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago; his terms ran from 17 December 1991 to 9 November 1995 and from 24 December 2001 to 26 May 2010. He was also the political leader of the People&#x27;s National Movement (PNM) from 1987 to 2010. A geologist by training, Manning served as Member of Parliament for the San Fernando East constituency from 1971 until 2015 when he was replaced by Randall Mitchell, but with the seat in 2020 being won by his son Brian Manning. Patrick Manning was the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives. He was the Leader of the Opposition from 1986 to 1990 and again from 1995 to 2001.

Manning was born in San Fernando and received his secondary education at Presentation College, San Fernando, and his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of the West Indies at Mona, in 1969. After graduation, he returned to Trinidad, where he worked as a geologist for Texaco. Trinidadian historian Dr Bridget Brereton published his biography in May 2024 titled, Manning.

== Life ==

=== Early career ===
After graduating from the University of the West Indies, Manning worked as a geologist with Texaco Trinidad Ltd., until he ran for Parliament in 1971. Between 1971 and 1978 he served as Parliamentary Secretary in various Ministries before being appointed junior Minister in the Ministry of Finance in the government of Eric Williams. In 1979 he was given the additional position of junior Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister. In 1981 he was given a full Cabinet position of Minister of Information and Minister of Industry and Commerce. Between 1981 and 1986 he served as Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.

The 1986 general elections saw the ruling PNM suffer an almost total defeat. Only three candidates won their seats; the prime minister, George Chambers, was among the losing candidates. As one of the three successful PNM candidates, Manning was appointed Leader of the Opposition. In 1987, he was elected political leader of the PNM, the youngest the party has seen at only 40 years old. A split in the ruling National Alliance for Reconstruction in 1988 left the PNM as the minority Opposition party, and, in 1990, Basdeo Panday requested that he be appointed Leader of the Opposition.

=== Second term as prime minister ===
In 1995, Manning called a general election one full year before it was constitutionally due. In this election both the PNM and the UNC won 17 seats each and the NAR won 2 seats. The UNC and the NAR united in a coalition and formed the government; Basdeo Panday replaced Manning as prime minister. Manning served as Leader of the Opposition once again, also losing the 2000 elections. The 2001 elections ended in a tie, with both the Opposition PNM and the governing United National Congress winning 18 seats. President A. N. R. Robinson appointed Manning as prime minister. In addition to prime ministership, Manning was also Minister of Finance from 2001 to 2007.

Unable to elect a Speaker of the House of Representatives, Manning proceeded to rule without Parliament until the need to pass a Budget forced him to call elections in October 2002. His party won this election with 20 seats to 16 for the UNC and formed the new government.
Under the PNM administration, income taxes were substantially reduced and the Corporation Tax was reduced from 35% to 25% of profits for most companies. The Government also instituted free university education. The economy grew a pace, primarily due to high natural gas and oil prices and to significant increases in natural gas production. In September 2007, Manning received an honorary doctorate from Medgar Evers College, CUNY.

===Third term as prime minister===
In 2007, Manning called for a general election to be held on 4 November. The PNM won this election with 26 of the 41 seats and Manning began his third term as prime minister.

Subsequently, the country experienced a slow down in the economy. Despite this the economic ratings of the country came in for high praises mainly from the Standards and Poor report on 15 August 2008 which raised Trinidad and Tobago from an &quot;A−&quot; to an &quot;A&quot;. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago also hosted King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia of Spain on 30 November to 2 December 2008. The purpose of the visit was to strengthen the economic ties between Spain, Latin America and the Caribbean and also to open new markets and possibility for increase trading and the opening of new markets. The country also hosted two world summits in 2009: the 5th Summit of the Americas on 17 to 19 April 2009 as well as The Commonwealth Heads of Government on 27 to 29 November 2009.

The Chilean president Michelle Bachelet paid Prime Minister Manning and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago a visit in 2010. The purpose was to strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries and as a result a formal agreement was signed in an effort to unite the two countries.

Despite economic growth, crime was considered a serious problem. The number of murders increased sharply from 93 in 1999 to 509 in 2009. Additionally, 2008 saw the country&#x27;s highest number of murders with 550. The Prime Minister&#x27;s explanation was that the crime problem was a result of the illegal drug and arms trade. His speech at the 5th summit of the Americas points to the fact that the Caribbean is situated between the narcotic producing South American continent and the narcotic consuming North American continent. Some of his crime detection and prevention methods included the introduction of the Special Anti-Crime Unit of Trinidad and Tobago (SAUTT), two surveillance airships (commonly referred to as blimps), and the inclusion of six high speed off-shore patrol vessels for better control of the country&#x27;s maritime borders and coastlines on 15 February 2010. Manning was quoted as saying that the country could expect to see a 50% decrease in crime because of this effort.

===2010 elections===
On 9 April 2010 Prime Minister Manning advised President George Maxwell Richards to dissolve Parliament resulting in a general election to be held two years sooner than was constitutionally mandated. Manning later announced 24 May 2010 as the date for general elections. Manning and the PNM lost the election to The People&#x27;s Partnership (UNC, COP, TOP, NJAC, MSJ). Following the defeat, Manning officially resigned as Political Leader of the Party on 27 May 2010 but remained as the Parliamentary Representative for San Fernando East.

Manning was sent to the Privileges Committee following statements he made in Parliament on 19 November 2010, during a debate on the Interception of Communications Bill. Manning had made certain allegations about the private residence of Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar on the San Fernando/Siparia/Erin Road. On 24 November 2010, Speaker of the House Wade Mark ruled that a &quot;prima facie&quot; case of contempt or breach of privilege had been made out against Manning and referred the matter to the committee for consideration. Manning was accordingly suspended from the service of the House of Representatives with immediate effect on 16 May 2011, as declared by House Speaker Wade Mark. During this period, Manning wouldn&#x27;t be able to represent his San Fernando East constituency in Parliament. Manning is the second Prime Minister to be suspended from the House of Representatives in Trinidad and Tobago.

===Illness and death===
On 24 September 2007, Manning went to Cuba for a routine medical evaluation. For many years, he had engaged in a regular exercise program. On 23 January 2012, Manning suffered a stroke. Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was confirmed on 30 June 2016 and he died at 8:15 AM on 2 July 2016 at the San Fernando General Hospital, at age 69.

== &quot;Manning Initiative(s)&quot; ==
=== The Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad &amp; Tobago initiative ===
In 1991 Barbados and the Co-Operative Republic of Guyana attempted moves towards forming a tri-state confederation consisting of Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Manning pitched the initiative for the tri-state area to enter into some form of political union or political association. This initiative was short lived and did not proceed following the Democratic Labour Party&#x27;s defeat during the 1994 elections.

<doc id="393860" wikidata="Q208497" url="?curid=393860" title="Tupou VI">
<text>Tupou VI (ʻAho‘eitu ʻUnuakiʻotonga Tukuʻaho; born 12 July 1959) is the King of Tonga.

The future Tupou VI was born at Tonga&#x27;s Royal Palace as the youngest child of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, later King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV and Queen Halaevalu. He was named ʻAho‘eitu at birth. ʻAho‘eitu served as Prime Minister of Tonga from 2000 to 2006. Following his elder brother&#x27;s accession to the Tongan throne as George Tupou V, he was officially confirmed as the heir presumptive on 27 September 2006, because his brother had no legitimate children. In 2008, he was appointed Tonga&#x27;s High Commissioner to Australia, and resided in Canberra until the death of George Tupou V on 18 March 2012, when he became King of Tonga, with the regnal name Tupou VI. He also served as the Chancellor of the University of the South Pacific from 2013 to 2014. He was crowned in 2015 by the Reverend D&#x27;Arcy Wood.

== Early life and education ==
ʻAhoʻeitu was born in Nukuʻalofa, Tonga on 12 July 1959, as the third son and youngest child of Crown Prince Tupoutoʻa Tungī (later King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV). He attended The Leys School in Cambridge from 1973 to 1977, followed by enrolment at the University of East Anglia, where he studied Development Studies between 1977 and 1980.

== Military career ==
ʻAhoʻeitu joined the naval arm of the Tonga Defence Services in 1982, achieving the rank of Lieutenant-Commander by 1987. He graduated from the US Naval War College as part of Class 33 in 1988.

His military service included commanding the Pacific-class patrol boat VOEA &quot;Pangai&quot; from 1990 to 1995, during which he participated in peacekeeping operations in Bougainville. Then, he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in defence studies from the University of New South Wales in 1997 and another master&#x27;s degree in international relations from Bond University in 1999.

== Governmental career ==
In 1998, ʻAhoʻeitu transitioned from his military career to government service, assuming dual roles as defence minister and foreign minister until August 2004. These roles were previously held by his elder brother Tupoutoʻa, who was then the crown prince and later became King Siaosi Tupou V.

== Prime Minister of Tonga ==
ʻAhoʻeitu, then known as Prince ʻUlukālala Lavaka Ata, assumed the role of prime minister on 3 January 2000.

In 2004, several Members of Parliament (MPs) advocated for his resignation as prime minister following their decision to boycott the inauguration of the Tonga Legislative Assembly. Among the MPs was Feleti Sevele, who cited the closure of Royal Tongan Airlines as one of several adverse events associated with the prime minister&#x27;s tenure. Sevele questioned the prime minister&#x27;s ability to govern Tonga, asserting that an inability to manage an airline raised doubts about his capacity to govern the country effectively.

ʻAhoʻeitu resigned as prime minister on 11 February 2006. His departure coincided with a period of heightened civil unrest, as pro-democracy protests advocating for a reduced governmental role of the royal family gained traction from mid-2005 onward. The Nukuʻalofa riots later that year underscored a growing dissatisfaction with the existing political structure, calls for increased political representation and a more equal distribution of power.

== Diplomatic career ==
ʻAhoʻeitu took on the position of the chief of mission for Tonga&#x27;s High Commission in Canberra when it was inaugurated in 2008, a position he held until his succession to the Tongan throne in 2012. This move represented a notable development in Tonga&#x27;s diplomatic relations with Australia, highlighting the establishment of a formal diplomatic presence.

Concurrently, he served as a non-resident Ambassador to Japan from 15 January 2010 until his accession in 2012.

== Reign ==
ʻAhoʻeitu became the King of Tonga on the death of his elder brother, George Tupou V, on 18 March 2012. He was installed as 20th Chancellor of the University of the South Pacific (USP) for a term of one year during the USP Tonga Graduation ceremony in July 2013.

=== Coronation ===

King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau’u were crowned in a ceremony conducted at Centenary Church in Nukuʻalofa on 4 July 2015 by the Reverend D&#x27;Arcy Wood, a retired Uniting Church in Australia minister who was born in Tonga. He was assisted by the Reverend &#x27;Ahio and the Reverend Tevita Havea, the president and the secretary general of the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga. About 15,000 guests attended the celebration.

During the ceremony, Tupou VI was anointed with holy oil, adorned with a ring, and presented with a sceptre. The crown was then placed on his head by Wood, who performed the anointing and crowning as a matter of circumventing the taboo on native Tongans touching the King&#x27;s head. The celebrations ran for a total of eleven days, beginning a week before the ceremony.

=== Dismissal of government ===
On 25 August 2017, Tupou VI dismissed Prime Minister ʻAkilisi Pōhiva, dissolved the Legislative Assembly, and ordered early elections to be held by mid-November. Following the king&#x27;s dissolution of the government, the speaker, Lord Tuʻivakanō, issued a statement explaining his advice to the King that led him to dismiss the Prime Minister. Lord Tuʻivakanō stated that Pōhiva had made unconstitutional moves, including signing international agreements without the King&#x27;s consent. Pōhiva was reelected soon after in November.

=== Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption and tsunami ===
On 15 January 2022, the King was temporarily relocated from the Royal Palace following the eruption of Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai and the ensuing tsunami. After this, he called for unity and vowed to rebuild.

=== Loss of confidence in ministers ===
On 2 February 2024, Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni was absent from Tonga, receiving medical treatment in New Zealand. During this time, King Tupou VI purportedly revoked the appointment of Siaosi Sovaleni as the armed forces minister and Fekitamoeloa ʻUtoikamanu as the minister of foreign affairs and tourism, with the nine noble MPs urging them to resign from their ministerial positions. The Attorney General of Tonga, Linda Folaumoetu&#x27;i, advised the Cabinet that the King&#x27;s action was unconstitutional.

In response to the revocation of their appointments, Siaosi Sovaleni and Fekitamoeloa ʻUtoikamanu publicly announced their resignation from their respective ministerial positions in April 2024.

== Marriage and family ==
ʻAhoʻeitu is married to Nanasipauʻu Tukuʻaho, daughter of Baron Vaea. They have three children and four grandchildren. Their eldest child, Princess Lātūfuipeka Tukuʻaho (Angelika Lātūfuipeka Halaevalu Mataʻaho Napua-o-kalani Tukuʻaho), born on 17 November 1983, has been the High Commissioner to Australia since 22 August 2012.

Their second child, Crown Prince Tupoutoʻa ʻUlukalala (Siaosi Manumataongo ʻAlaivahamamaʻo ʻAhoʻeitu Konstantin Tukuʻaho), born on 17 September 1985, married his second cousin, Sinaitakala Fakafanua, on 12 July 2012. They have four children: Prince Taufaʻahau Manumataongo (born 10 May 2013), Princess Halaevalu Mataʻaho (born 12 July 2015), Princess Nanasipauʻu (born 20 March 2018), and Princess Salote Mafile’o Pilolevu (born 25 February 2021).

Their third child is Prince Ata (Viliami ʻUnuaki-ʻo-Tonga Mumui Lalaka-Mo-e-ʻEiki Tukuʻaho), born on 27 April 1988.

Upon his confirmation as heir presumptive, he acquired the noble title of Tupoutoʻa, traditionally reserved for crown princes, a position his older brother relinquished due to marrying a commoner, and was subsequently known as Tupoutoʻa Lavaka before ascending the throne. His other noble titles of ʻUlukālala of Fangatongo and ʻAta of Hihifo subsequently passed to each of his two sons.

<text>Koffi Sama (born 1944) was the Prime Minister of Togo from 29 June 2002 to 9 June 2005.

==Biography==
Sama was born at Amoutchou in Ogou Prefecture. He was Minister of Youth, Sports, and Culture from 1981 to 1984, Regional Director of Rural and Maritime Region Development from 1986 to 1990, and Director-General of the Togolese Cotton Company from 1990 to 1996, before re-entering the government as Minister of Health, in which position he served from 1996 to 1999.

In the March 1999 parliamentary election, Sama was elected to the National Assembly as the candidate of the ruling Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) in the Third Constituency of Ogou Prefecture; he ran unopposed and won the seat with 100% of the vote. He then served as Minister of National Education and Research from 1999 to 2002. On 7 December 2000, he also became the Secretary-General of the RPT.

President Gnassingbé Eyadéma appointed Sama as Prime Minister on 27 June 2002, replacing Agbeyome Kodjo; this move was said to have been done as part of preparations for the parliamentary election that was held later in the year. Following the death of Eyadéma on 5 February 2005, Sama, as Prime Minister, announced the news, calling it a &quot;national catastrophe&quot;. Sama left office on 9 June 2005, when he was succeeded by Edem Kodjo.

After serving as Prime Minister, Sama became a Special Advisor to President Faure Gnassingbé, with the rank of Minister; he remains in that post as of 2008. He was the head of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) observer mission in the Malian April 2007 presidential election.

Sama was a member of the RPT College of Sages.

<doc id="393865" wikidata="Q57661" url="?curid=393865" title="Jean-Claude Juncker">
<text>Jean-Claude Juncker (; born 9 December 1954) is a Luxembourgish politician who was the 23rd prime minister of Luxembourg from 1995 to 2013 and 12th president of the European Commission from 2014 to 2019. He also was Finance Minister from 1989 to 2009 and President of the Eurogroup from 2005 to 2013.

By the time Juncker left office as prime minister in 2013, he was the longest-serving head of any national government in the EU and one of the longest-serving democratically elected leaders in the world, with his tenure encompassing the height of the European financial and sovereign debt crisis. In 2005, he became the first permanent President of the Eurogroup.

In 2014, the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) had Juncker as its lead candidate, or &quot;Spitzenkandidat&quot;, for the presidency of the Commission in the 2014 elections. This marked the first time that the &quot;Spitzenkandidat&quot; process was employed. Juncker is the first president to have campaigned as a candidate for the position prior to the election, a process introduced with the Treaty of Lisbon. The EPP won 220 out of 751 seats in the Parliament. On 27 June 2014, the European Council officially nominated Juncker for the position, and the European Parliament elected him on 15 July 2014 with 422 votes out of the 729 cast. He took office on 1 November 2014 and served until 30 November 2019, when he was succeeded by Ursula von der Leyen.

Juncker has stated that his priorities would be the creation of a digital single market, the development of an EU Energy Union, the negotiation of the Transatlantic Trade Agreement, the continued reform of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union—with the social dimension in mind, a &quot;targeted fiscal capacity&quot; for the Eurozone, and the 2015–2016 British EU membership renegotiations.

== Early life ==
Juncker was born in Redange and spent the majority of his childhood in Belvaux. His father, Joseph, was a steel worker and Christian trade unionist who was forcibly conscripted into the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during World War II, following the Nazi occupation of Luxembourg. Juncker has often remarked that the horrors of war he heard from his father&#x27;s experiences had a profound influence in shaping his views on the need for European reconciliation and integration. His mother was born Marguerite Hecker. He studied at the Roman Catholic &quot;école apostolique&quot; (secondary school) at Clairefontaine on the edge of Arlon in Belgium, before returning to Luxembourg to study for his Baccalaureate at Lycée Michel Rodange. He joined the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party in 1974. He studied law at the University of Strasbourg, graduating with a master&#x27;s degree in 1979; although he was sworn into the Luxembourg Bar Council in 1980, he never practised as a lawyer.

Juncker grew up in Belvaux, in the commune of Sanem in the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette in the south of Luxembourg. Dominated by coal and steel manufacturing, the neighbourhood was home to a multicultural workforce of Italian and Portuguese immigrants. This social environment influenced Juncker&#x27;s way of thinking and his ideology of integration and togetherness. He visits his hometown as often as he can.

Juncker&#x27;s father was heavily wounded during his service in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; at the Eastern Front, which left him visibly scarred. Throughout his life Joseph Juncker was also a member of the Christian Labour union, and he took his son to several union and party meetings, which impacted his son&#x27;s political views even in his early days. Having come from a poor family, he made central to his political ideology the fight against social inequalities, and for equal opportunities and fairness for all people. Jean-Claude went to a Jesuit Boarding school close to the border of Belgium; as a schoolboy, Juncker negotiated and debated with the school&#x27;s administrators on behalf of his classmates. Juncker was one of twelve children in a large household, where money was tight; he learned from a young age the importance of saving. This experience proved useful during his later role as Minister of Finance.

== Career in national politics ==
=== Early years ===
Following Juncker&#x27;s graduation from the University of Strasbourg, he was appointed as a Parliamentary Secretary. He later won election to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 1984 and was immediately appointed to the Cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Santer as Minister of Labour. In the second half of 1985, Luxembourg held the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Communities, permitting Juncker to develop his European leadership qualities as chair of the Social Affairs and Budget Councils. It was here that Juncker&#x27;s pro-Europe credentials first emerged.

Shortly before the 1989 election Juncker was seriously injured in a road accident, spending two weeks in a coma. He has stated that the accident has caused him difficulty with balancing since. He nonetheless recovered in time to be returned to the Chamber of Deputies once more, after which he was promoted to become Minister for Finance, a post traditionally seen as a rite of passage to the country&#x27;s premiership. His eventual promotion to prime minister seemed at this time inevitable, with political commentators concluding that Santer was grooming Juncker as his successor. Juncker at this time also accepted the position of Luxembourg&#x27;s representative on the 188-member Board of Governors of the World Bank.

Juncker&#x27;s second election to Parliament, in 1989, saw him gain prominence within the European Union; Juncker chaired the Council of Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN), during Luxembourg&#x27;s 1991 presidency of the Council of the European Communities, becoming a key architect of the Maastricht Treaty. Juncker was largely responsible for clauses on Economic and Monetary Union, the process that would eventually give rise to the euro, as well as in particular is credited with devising the &quot;opt-out&quot; principle for the UK to assuage its concerns. Juncker was himself a signatory to the Treaty in 1992, having, by that time taken over as parliamentary leader of the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party.

Juncker was re-elected to the Chamber in 1994, maintaining his ministerial role. With Santer ready to be nominated as the next President of the European Commission, it was only six months later that Grand Duke Jean approved the appointment of Juncker as Prime Minister on 20 January 1995, as part of a coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. Juncker relinquished his post at the World Bank at this time, but maintained his position as Minister for Finance.

=== Premiership (1995–2013)===

Juncker&#x27;s first term as prime minister was focused on an economic platform of international bilateral ties to improve Luxembourg&#x27;s profile abroad, which included a number of official visits abroad. During one such visit, to Dublin in December 1996, Juncker successfully mediated a dispute over his own EU Economic and Monetary Union policy between French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The press dubbed Juncker the &quot;Hero of Dublin&quot; for achieving an unlikely consensus between the two.

1997 brought the rotating Presidency of the European Council to Luxembourg, during which time Juncker championed the cause of social integration in Europe, along with constituting the so-called &quot;Luxembourg Process&quot; for integrated European policy against unemployment. He also instigated the &quot;Euro 11&quot;, an informal group of European finance ministers for matters regarding his Economic and Monetary Union ideals. For all of these initiatives, he was honoured with the Vision for Europe Award in 1998.

Juncker succeeded in winning another term as prime minister in the 1999 election, although the coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party was broken in favour of one with the Democratic Party. After the 2004 election, the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party became the second largest party again, and Juncker again formed a coalition with them.

In 2005, Juncker inherited a second term as President of the European Council. Shortly after the expiration of his term came Luxembourg&#x27;s referendum on ratification, and Juncker staked his political career on its success, promising to resign if the referendum failed. The final result was a 56.5% Yes vote on an 88% turnout. His continued allegiance to European ideals earned him the 2006 Karlspreis. In 2009, he denounced the lifting of the excommunication of controversial Bishop Richard Williamson, a member of the Society of Saint Pius X.
Juncker supported the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Juncker added that he wanted NATO to take control of coalition military efforts in Libya as soon as possible.

On 19 November 2012, RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg aired a story alleging that the former head of the State Intelligence Service (SREL), Marco Mille, had used a wristwatch to covertly record a confidential conversation with Juncker in 2008. According to the report, although Juncker had later found out about the recording, he took no action against Mille and allowed him to leave the service in 2010 for a position with Siemens. A transcript of the conversation was published by &quot;D&#x27;Lëtzebuerger Land&quot;, which highlighted the disorganised state of the secret service, mentioned links between Grand Duke Henri and MI6 and referred to the &quot;Bommeleeër&quot; scandal. On 4 December 2012, the Chamber of Deputies voted to set up a Parliamentary Inquiry into allegations of SREL misconduct including the illegal bugging of politicians, purchase of cars for private use and allegations of taking payments and favours in exchange for access to officials. The inquiry heard from witnesses who claimed that SREL had conducted six or seven illegal wiretapping operations between 2007 and 2009, as well as covert operations in Iraq, Cuba and Libya. The report concluded that Juncker had to bear political responsibility for SREL&#x27;s activities, that he had been deficient in his control over the service and that he had failed to report all of the service&#x27;s irregularities to the enquiry commission. Juncker himself denied wrongdoing.

After a seven-hour debate in the Chamber of Deputies on 10 July, the withdrawal of support from the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party&#x27;s coalition partner, the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (LSAP), forced Juncker to agree to new elections. Alex Bodry, President of LSAP and Chair of the Parliamentary Inquiry into SREL, declared his lack of confidence in Juncker, saying: &quot;We invite the prime minister to take full political responsibility in this context and ask the government to intervene with the head of state to clear the path for new elections.&quot; Juncker tendered his resignation to the Grand Duke on 11 July. After the election, Juncker was succeeded on 4 December 2013 by Xavier Bettel.

==Career in European politics==

===Presidency of the Eurogroup===
In 2004, the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers decided to replace the rotating chairmanship with a permanent president. Juncker was appointed as the first permanent president and assumed the chair on 1 January 2005. He was re-appointed for a second term in September 2006. Under the Lisbon Treaty, this system was formalised and Juncker was confirmed for another term. Juncker stepped down on 21 January 2013, when he was succeeded by Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem.
During his period as &quot;Mr. Euro&quot;, the group was instrumental in negotiating and supervising bailout packages for the countries that faced bankruptcy: Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus.

Juncker was also an outspoken proponent of enhanced internal co-operation and increased international representation of the group.

In a debate in 2011, during the height of the eurozone crisis, Juncker responded to a conference-goer&#x27;s suggestion to increase the openness of the strategy discussions in the eurogroup, by stating: &quot;When it becomes serious you have to lie&quot;. Scholars of financial markets have remarked that the quote is often taken out of context by critics; best practice amongst monetary policy committees in most states is to keep negotiations on decisions confidential to prevent markets from betting against troubled countries until they are finalised. This need is complicated by the Eurozone&#x27;s arrangements, in which policy negotiations are held in high-profile international summits of eurozone finance ministers, where leaks of ongoing negotiations may potentially put &quot;millions of people at risk&quot;. Indeed, the quote continues;

He further stated that when asked by a journalist to comment on those meetings he had had to lie, making clear it went against his personal moral conviction as a Catholic.

===Presidency of the European Commission (2014–2019)===
For the first time in 2014, the President of the European Commission was appointed under the new provisions established with the Treaty of Lisbon, which had entered into force after the 2009 Elections to the European Parliament, on 1 December 2009. Juncker&#x27;s aide Martin Selmayr played a central role in his campaign and later during his presidency as Juncker&#x27;s campaign director, head of Juncker&#x27;s transition team and finally as Juncker&#x27;s head of cabinet (chief of staff).

====Primary election====
Almost all major European political parties, put forward a lead candidate, or &quot;spitzenkandidat&quot; for their respective election campaign. At the election Congress of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), held in Dublin on 6–7 March, Jean-Claude Juncker was elected the party&#x27;s lead candidate for President of the commission, defeating Michel Barnier. The congress also adopted the EPP election manifesto, which was used by Juncker during his campaign.

====Election campaign====

In the main debate between the candidates, transmitted live throughout Europe on 16 May via the European Broadcasting Union, all candidates agreed that it would be unacceptable if the European Council would propose someone as Commission President who had not publicly campaigned for the position ahead of the election.

In the elections, held 22–25 May, the EPP won the most parliamentary seats of all parties (221 of 751), but short of a majority in its own right.

====Institutional approval====
On 27 May, the leaders of five of the seven political groups of the parliament issued a statement that Jean-Claude Juncker, being the lead candidate of the party which won a plurality of the seats, should be given the first attempt to form the required majority to be elected Commission President. Only the ECR and EFD disagreed to this process.
Later on 27 May, the European Council gave its president, Herman van Rompuy, the mandate to start consultations with the group leaders in the European Parliament to identify the best possible candidate. Having less influence over the appointment than under pre-Lisbon law, the Council instead made use of its right to set the strategic priorities, and included discussions with Parliament leaders and Council members alike for a strategic agenda for the upcoming period in Rompuy&#x27;s mandate.

During the consultations, Juncker and the EPP agreed to cooperation with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), the second largest group in the new parliament, as well as secured the backing of all but two member state leaders. In return for their support, the centre-left group and state leaders secured promises of a shift in focus away from austerity towards growth and job creation for the coming period, as well as promises of some of the top jobs. 

 
The European Council officially proposed Juncker to Parliament as candidate for the Presidency on 27 June, together with a strategic agenda setting out policy priorities for the upcoming Commission mandate period.

For the first time the nomination was not by consensus, but the European Council voted 26–2 to propose Juncker for the position. Voting against were British PM David Cameron (Conservative Party / AECR) and Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán (Fidesz / EPP), both of whom had frequently opposed Juncker during the election process. Prior to the vote, various media had reported the heads of government of Sweden, Netherlands and Germany were also having similar concerns regarding either the candidate himself, or the way the nomination process was conducted. This was however never confirmed by the politicians in question.

Once Juncker had been nominated by the Council he started visiting all of the political groups of the European Parliament in order to explain his visions as well as gain their support in order to get appointed as Commission President. The purpose was also to show that he had understood some criticism levelled by Eurosceptics in Brussels. This was demonstrated when the former prime minister of Luxembourg told the ECR lawmakers that &quot;[d]espite what you may read in the British press, I do not want a United States of Europe,&quot; as well as &quot;I do not believe that Europe can be constructed against the nation state.&quot;

On 15 July, Juncker presented his political programme to the European Parliament in plenary. Following a debate, the MEPs appointed Juncker to the position of Commission President with 422 votes in favour, well over the 376 required, and 250 votes against.
===Turkish membership in the European Union=== 

On 25 July 2016, Juncker said that Turkey was not in a position to become a member of the European Union in the near future and that accession negotiations between the EU and Turkey would be stopped immediately if the death penalty was brought back.
==Controversies==
In early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the commission, Juncker was hit by media disclosures—derived from a document leak known as LuxLeaks—that Luxembourg under his premiership had turned into a major European centre of corporate tax avoidance. With the aid of the Luxembourg government, companies transferred tax liability for many billions of euros to Luxembourg, where the income was taxed at a fraction of 1%. Juncker, who in a speech in Brussels in July 2014 promised to &quot;try to put some morality, some ethics, into the European tax landscape&quot;, was sharply criticised following the leaks. A subsequent motion of censure in the European Parliament was brought against Juncker over his role in the tax avoidance schemes. The motion was defeated by a large majority. During his tenure, Juncker also oversaw the 2014 opening of the Luxembourg Freeport, which former German Member of European Parliament Wolf Klinz dubbed &quot;fertile ground for money laundering and tax evasion&quot;.

In January 2017, leaked diplomatic cables show Juncker, as Luxembourg&#x27;s prime minister from 1995 until the end of 2013, blocked EU efforts to fight tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Luxembourg agreed to multinational businesses on an individualised deal basis, often at an effective rate of less than 1%.

In July 2017, Juncker described the European Parliament as &quot;ridiculous&quot; after only a few dozen MEPs came to attend a debate dedicated to evaluating Malta&#x27;s time holding the 6-month term rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU, accusing MEPs of showing a lack of respect for smaller EU countries. Although rebuked for his remark by the Parliament&#x27;s president, Antonio Tajani, Juncker responded, &quot;I will never again attend a meeting of this kind.&quot; Jaume Duch Guillot, chief spokesman for the Parliament, later said on Twitter that Juncker &quot;regretted&quot; the incident and that Tajani considered the case closed. However, it is not known whether Juncker apologised for his outburst.

==Personal life==
In addition to his native Luxembourgish, Juncker is fluent in English, French, German and Latin.

Juncker suffers from sciatica attacks following a 1989 car accident, which cause him occasional unsteadiness while walking. A video of Juncker stumbling and receiving assistance from several EU politicians at a NATO leaders&#x27; event in July 2018 prompted comments about his health, though his spokesman dismissed the concerns.

Speculations about alcoholism surrounded Juncker for several years and have been discussed by several high-profile EU politicians. In 2014, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, at the time Dutch Minister of Finance, described Juncker in an interview as a &quot;heavy smoker and drinker&quot;, but later apologized for his comments. Juncker himself has always denied these allegations in interviews.

Juncker is married to Christiane Frising. The couple have no children.

<text>Frederick Tluway Sumaye (born 29 May 1950) is a Tanzanian politician who was Prime Minister of Tanzania from 28 November 1995 to 30 December 2005.

==Life and career==
As a member of the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Sumaye was a Member of Parliament for Hanang Constituency from 1983 to 2005 and served in the Cabinet as the Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Cooperatives. He was the Prime Minister from 1995 to 2005.

After leaving office, Sumaye was a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization; subsequently, in 2006, he enrolled for a year as a mid-career student in the Edward S. Mason Program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, earning a Master of Public Administration.

Sumaye unsuccessfully sought the ruling CCM&#x27;s nomination as its presidential candidate in 2015. Thereafter, he joined one of the opposition parties (CHADEMA) which was among the opposition parties that formed the opposition movement UKAWA on 22 August 2015. In a speech that he gave shortly after announcing that he was joining the opposition, Sumaye said he was doing so in order to strengthen the opposition.

On 4 December 2019, Sumaye announced that he was leaving CHADEMA following his defeat in an internal party election for the Coast Zone CHADEMA chairman position. That came less than a week after the election where he was the only contestant for the position.

Einars Repše graduated from Latvia State University (now known as University of Latvia) in 1986 with a degree in physics (specialisation – radio electronics).
He first entered politics in 1988 as one of the founders of the Latvian National Independence Movement (LNNK), a political organization promoting Latvia&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union. He was elected to the parliament of Latvia in 1990.

== Career ==

=== 1990s ===
From 1991 to 2001, Repše was the president of the Bank of Latvia (Latvia&#x27;s central bank). During this period, he oversaw the introduction of the Latvian rouble, Latvia&#x27;s temporary transitional currency and the Lats, independent Latvia&#x27;s new currency. Under Repše, the Bank of Latvia pursued a tight monetary policy, implementing a de facto currency board for the Lats. As a result, the exchange rate of the lat has been stable since the early 1990s till now. Inflation was brought down from almost 1000% initially to low single digits within a few years. The success of the Lats made Repše very popular in Latvia.
=== 2000s ===
In 2001, Repše resigned from the Bank of Latvia to return to politics. He founded the New Era Party, a Populist anti-corruption party. After the 2002 elections, Repše became the Prime Minister of Latvia in November 2002. He led a coalition of his own New Era Party, the Latvia&#x27;s First Party, the Union of Greens and Farmers and For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK. Repše&#x27;s government became known for an outspoken fight against corruption and tax evasion. Several high-ranked government officials, including the head of Latvia&#x27;s state revenue service, were fired or resigned. The anti-corruption measures resulted in some success, as the revenues from the gasoline tax, previously notorious for tax evasion, increased by 30% in one year. The revenues from other taxes, however, were not significantly different, compared to the previous governments, and some of the anti-corruption measures backfired (for example, some of the fired officials successfully sued the Latvian government for wrongful dismissal). Repše&#x27;s government also implemented a tight control on budget expenses, reducing the budget deficit from 3% of GDP in 2002 to 1.8% in 2003.

Starting in September 2003, a conflict between Repše and the Latvia First Party, one of his coalition partners, became apparent. Repše blamed the conflict on vested interests resisting his anti-corruption plans. The coalition partners mentioned Repše&#x27;s authoritarian management style and unofficially delegating many of his powers as prime minister to his chief of staff Dans Titavs as the main reason for the conflict. Repše&#x27;s government became a minority administration in January 2004 after the Latvia First Party left the government. He and his cabinet resigned in February 2004. After being in opposition during Indulis Emsis government, the New Era Party joined the Aigars Kalvītis coalition government in December 2004, with Repše becoming the minister of defence. During his service, however, he at times was portrayed by the press as more involved in his hobbies and business, than in governmental activities, losing popularity among the electorate.

In 2003, Repše bought real estate at various locations in rural Latvia for a total of 323 718 lats (approx. 500 000 euros). His real estate purchases were funded by loans from two Latvian banks, Hansabanka and Nord/LB Latvia. Repše&#x27;s opponents immediately questioned his real estate deals, claiming that Repše has used his position to obtain loans on conditions better than those available to the general public. His deals were investigated by a special committee of the Latvian parliament. In December 2005, a criminal probe was started by the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB). Due to this investigation, Repše resigned from his position as the minister of defence, even though he was never officially declared a suspect under the case. On 12 October 2007 KNAB closed the criminal probe – no wrongdoing was discovered.

Repše&#x27;s real estate deals, confrontational management style and somewhat flamboyant lifestyle led to a major decline in his popularity. In 1999 and 2000, Repše was one of the most trusted politicians in Latvia, with 75%–80% Latvians having a positive opinion of him. By the time of his resignation in 2005, he was the least popular minister in the Latvian government.

Repše was Minister of Finance of Latvia from 12 March 2009 to 3 November 2010, during the toughest time right after the world credit crisis. He brought down the deficits ruthlessly, put the state finances in order, and paved the way for Latvia to join the euro which was accomplished during the next government.

=== 2010s ===
In 2013 Repše returned to active politics and founded society, later transformed into political party &quot;For Latvia&#x27;s Development&quot;.
After unsuccessful parliamentary elections in October 2014, Repše completely retired from politics. 

== Personal life ==
As to his hobbies, he is known to be interested in flying, aircraft building, painting and mountaineering.

<text>The torrent salamanders or Cascade salamanders are a family of salamanders (Rhyacotritonidae) with only one genus, Rhyacotriton. The torrent salamanders have highly reduced lungs and are endemic to the United States in the Pacific Northwest (including northwestern California).

==Description==
Maximum adult snout-vent length is 6 cm. They have complete metamorphosis, but a few neotenic traits have been found, like the presence of conical teeth and reduced or absent nasal bones. Nasal bones have never been seen in &quot;R. olympicus&quot;. but are present in some specimens of the other species, and occurs most often in &quot;R. variegatus&quot;. The lungs are minute; in &quot;R. olympicus&quot; they are 5 to 7 mm in length, but highly vascular and filled with air. They are very sensitive to desiccation and warm temperatures. More than 83 °F (28 °C) can be fatal, and they can only tolerate a water loss of 19.4 percent of initial body weight at most (compared to 29.0 to 32.9 percent for other species). Because of this, they are rarely found more than a meter away from free-running water. On rare occasions adults can be found under objects a few meters from water after heavy rain. Males have a unique vent gland.

==Reproduction==
Courtship is terrestrial. The male will deposit a spermatophore on the ground, which is then picked up by the female. The eggs have a pale yellow-white ova, and are deposited separately and haphazardly in slow-flowing water. Sometimes communal oviposition occurs. They are attached neither to each other or to the substrate, which is unique in salamanders. Parental care is absent.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Rhyacotriton&quot; includes four species:
*Cascade torrent salamander (&quot;R. cascadae&quot;)
*Columbia torrent salamander (&quot;R. kezeri&quot;)
*Olympic torrent salamander (&quot;R. olympicus&quot;)
*Southern torrent salamander (&quot;R. variegatus&quot;)

==Taxonomy==
Originally the genus &quot;Rhyacotriton&quot; was placed in the family Ambystomatidae, later in the family Dicamptodontidae, and finally in 1992 it was placed into a family of its own. At the same time the only species &quot;Rhyacotriton olympicus&quot; was split into four species due to genetic analysis.

<text>Haenam (&quot;Haenam-gun&quot;) is a county in South Jeolla Province, South Korea.
The capital of Haenam-gun is Haenam-eup (Haenam town).

The economy of the county is based mainly on agriculture, with rice and radish being the two most common crops.

==History==
Haenam County has been inhabited since the Neolithic. Relics of the Bronze Age, such as dolmens and shell mounds, were discovered here. The term Haenam appeared during the Goryeo dynasty but a definite record does not exist. After 1895 (32nd year of King Gojong in the Joseon dynasty) it came to be called as Haenam-gun, and became the biggest county in Jeonnam.

== Welfare ==
=== Birth promotion policy ===
Haenam is attracting attention with its birth rate more than double the average in South Korea. In &#x27;2014 Birth Statistics&#x27;, its total fertility rate was 2.4 per person, making it the nation&#x27;s first birth rate. This is the result of various childbirth policies implemented by the birth policy team. Some of these policies are introduced.

# It is the settlement of worry about housing arrangement. The sale price of apartments in Jeollanamdo, which Haenam County belongs to, is less than half the national average. To get a 99 square meters apartment, you need 152 million won (Korean currency unit). This is not only a quarter of the Seoul apartment sale price, but also less than the private rent price.
# It is an extraordinary birth grant. In Haenam County, if you give birth to the first child, 3 million won will be paid. If you give birth to a second child, you will receive 3.5 million won. If you give birth to a third child, you will receive 6 million won. If you have a fourth child, you will receive 7,200,000 won.
# It is a witty birth related program. Haenam notifies the birth of the baby through the local newspaper and plans harmony of local residents. In addition, there are many interesting programs such as &#x27;Dad Camp for the Land&#x27;, which encourages dad to take part in housekeeping and housework, a &#x27;stroller marching concert&#x27; that all residents can enjoy, and &#x27;escape trip to the end of the earth&#x27; for unmarried men and women.
# Finally, job creation is through agricultural and marine products and food-specific complexes. Haenam is actively working on building a wealthy farming and fishing village, focusing on the issue of jobs and cultivating processed sweet potatoes and eco-friendly items. The &#x27;Haenam Food Specialization Complex&#x27;, a food manufacturing and agro-industrial complex based on eco-friendly farming, aquatic and livestock products, is currently sold under the guidance of the military.

==Economy==

The county has large farmland and reclaimed land. As of 2019, there are about 20,000 agricultural workers. Since the total population is about 65,000, the proportion of agricultural workers is high. The total length of the county&#x27;s coastline is 302 km, and there are a total of 65 manned and uninhabited islands. The population engaged in fishing is 9,403, about half of the agricultural workers.

The county contains the historic restaurant Cheonil Sikdang, the seventh-oldest active restaurant in South Korea.

==Geography==
Haenam faces Gangjin to the east, Yeongam to the north, Jindo and Wando to the west and south across the sea.

Additionally, Haenam is located below Taebaek Mountains and goes through an oceanic climate. It is quite a warm area even among southern region of South Korea. There is rias coast around Hwawon peninsula.

===Climate===
==Products==
Thanks to its large-scale farming, Haenam has been the main source of crops from sweet potatoes to cabbages. The cabbage is specially produced in wintertime and Haenam occupies 70% of production.

A special type of orange, the hallabong, is also grown in Haenam county. Before, Jeju was the only place to grow hallabong but many counties in Jeonnam started to cultivate this breed, which is largely owing to the greenhouse effect.

<text>Hampyeong County (&quot;Hampyeong-gun&quot;) is a county in South Jeolla Province, South Korea.

==History==
Hampyeong used to be called Jinguk(진국) in prehistoric times, and Mahan in the Samhan age. Mahan consisted of 54 smaller counties, and it is estimated that one or two of these counties were part of present-day Hampyeong County according to the evidence of dolmens in the area.

Hampyeong was divided into two hyeon, Gulrae-hyeon and Daji-hyeon during the reign of Baekje Kingdom(18 B.C ~ 660 A.D.). Gulrea-hyeon was called Hampyeong-hyeon during the reign of the Silla Kingdom and in the Goryeo Kingdom. Today it covers Hampyeong-eub, Sonbul-myeon, Singwang-myeon, and Dadong-myeon.

Dagyeong-myeon, Dadong-myeon, Sonbul-myeon, Singwang-myeon, pyeongreung-myeon, Sinji-myeon, Haebo-myeon, Wolak-myeon, Modong-myeon, Daeya-myeon.

On May 26, 1989, Hampyeong-hyeon changed its name to Hampyeong county. On November 11, 1932, Sikji-myeon and pyeongreung-myeon were annexed, and Nasan-myeon was added. On January 1, 1963, Hampyeong-myeon became Hampyeong-eub and it consisted of one eup and 8 myeons.

On July 1, 1973, Sang-ok, Wolsong, Geumgok, and Baekho were annexed into Dadong-myeon.

<text>In anatomy, a meatus (, , : meatus or meatuses) is a natural body opening or canal.

Meatus may refer to:
* the external acoustic meatus, the opening of the ear canal
* the internal auditory meatus, a canal in the temporal bone of the skull
* the urinary meatus, which is the opening of the urethra, situated on the glans penis in males and in the vulval vestibule in females
* one of three nasal meatuses: the superior meatus, middle meatus and inferior meatus; each are passages through the nasal cavity within the skull

(The plural forms of &quot;meatus&quot; are: &quot;meatus&quot;, as a Latin form (of the fourth declension noun class, which the word belongs to); or &quot;meatuses&quot;, as a normally derived English plural; or often, and incorrectly, &quot;meati&quot;, by false analogy with the very common Latin &quot;-us/-i&quot; forms (such as &quot;alumnus/alumni&quot;), i.e., the second declension noun class.)

<doc id="393887" wikidata="Q849486" url="?curid=393887" title="Havok (character)">
<text>Havok is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. He first appears in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #54 (March 1969), and was created by writer Arnold Drake and penciller Don Heck. Havok generates powerful &quot;plasma blasts&quot;, an ability he has had difficulty controlling.

One of the sons of Corsair, Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; Summers is the younger brother of the X-Men&#x27;s Cyclops, and the older brother of Vulcan and the older half brother of Adam X. He often resents Cyclops&#x27;s authoritarian attitude and reputation as a model member of the X-Men. In contrast, Havok and his longtime love interest Polaris have had a love-hate relationship with the team, often finding themselves roped into it. Both were also members of the 1990s-era Pentagon-sponsored mutant team X-Factor. After X-Factor disbanded, Havok starred in &quot;Mutant X&quot;, a series in which he explored a strange alternate reality. He has since returned to the X-Men, later taking over his father&#x27;s role as leader of the Starjammers to bring Vulcan&#x27;s reign over the Shi&#x27;ar to an end.

In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Havok as #44 on their list of the &quot;50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot;. Lucas Till played Havok in the films &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011), &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), and &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016).

==Publication history==

Created by writer Arnold Drake and artist Don Heck, Havok first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; (March 1969). He is typically portrayed as struggling under the shadow of his more esteemed brother.

In the 2012 relaunch of Marvel comic books, Havok led a team called the Uncanny Avengers, a mix of the X-Men and the Avengers teams.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
Alexander Summers was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the second of the three known sons of Christopher Summers, a United States Air Force Major and test pilot, and his wife Katherine Anne. When Alex was a boy growing up in Anchorage, Alaska, United States, his father took the family for a flight in their airplane, which came under attack by a Shi&#x27;ar spaceship. As the plane caught fire and was crashing, his parents fastened Alex and his older brother Scott into a parachute and pushed them off the plane in hopes that they would survive. His brother hit his head and was in a coma for a short while.

The Summers boys were recovered and put into an orphanage and Alex was soon adopted though Scott remained there for much of his childhood. Alex was raised by the Blandings whose son Todd had died in a car accident. They tried to make Alex fit into the image of their son, and he tried to do as best he could. When the boy responsible for Todd&#x27;s death kidnapped Alex and his foster sister, Haley, Alex manifested his powers for the first time, incinerating the boy. Mister Sinister, an evil geneticist who was obsessed with the Summers bloodline, appeared eager yet surprised that Alex&#x27;s potential exceeded Scott&#x27;s – despite the fact that he seemed to lack control over his gift. Sinister placed psi-blocks on both Alex and Haley&#x27;s minds, causing them to forget what had happened that night.

===First encounter with X-Men===
Alex went on to study and earn a degree in geophysics at college. There he first met the original X-Men, and learned that Cyclops is his brother. His mutant powers became apparent when he was kidnapped by the Living Pharaoh, who declared Alex the only being able to rival his power. The two shared the same cosmic energy-absorption abilities, in reverse proportion to each other. By locking Alex in a shielded cell, the Pharaoh was able to absorb enough cosmic energy to become the Living Monolith. The X-Men fought a losing battle against the virtually unstoppable Monolith, until Alex managed to free himself, and the Monolith turned back into the Living Pharaoh.

Alex&#x27;s mutant power at first seemed to manifest itself only when he was near death. He was unable to control it, and feared its immense power.

Alex was later captured by Larry Trask and his Sentinels, who were bent on controlling or eradicating all mutants. Trask fashioned a costume for Alex that would help him control his powers and Alex was given the code name Havok. Trask turned out to be a mutant himself and the Sentinels were defeated by the X-Men. Havok lost control of his powers, however, and his excess energy was absorbed by Sauron. Havok then gained control of his powers.

Havok actively joined the X-Men team, and began a relationship with Lorna Dane/Polaris, much to the anger of Iceman who was romantically interested in her as well. While the senior X-Men were in the Savage Land, Havok and Polaris were approached by Professor X about the imminent invasion of the alien Z’Nox. During this time, the couple fell in love.

With the original X-Men, Havok and Polaris were captured by Krakoa the living island, but were rescued by the new X-Men. Havok and Polaris then quit the team&#x27;s active membership along with most of the original members.

Havok was again captured by the Living Pharaoh, and was this time rescued by Spider-Man and Thor.

Havok and Polaris were occasional members and allies of the X-Men for years. They alternated between doing graduate work and earning a postgraduate degree in the American Southwest – where they occasionally encountered the Hulk – and helping out Moira MacTaggert at her facility for genetic research on Muir Island, off the coast of Scotland. It was during their stay on Muir Island that Havok helped the X-Men battle Proteus.

Eventually, Alex learned that Corsair of the Starjammers was really his father.

During one of their adventures, Polaris was possessed by the mutant Marauder Malice, ending the romantic relationship for a time. Havok then sought out and rejoined the X-Men.

===Wolverine and the X-Men===
During this period, Havok became involved with Madelyne Pryor. Both of them had been rejected by their previous lovers: Pryor&#x27;s then-husband Cyclops had left her for Jean Grey. Madelyne was manipulated by N&#x27;astirh and became the Goblin Queen. She attempted to use Havok to help take over the world and transform it into a demonic realm. Havok eventually came to his senses and Madelyne killed herself after discovering she was a clone of Jean Grey.

Havok befriended Wolverine and others, then they shared adventures. While they were vacationing in Mexico, they were targeted by a terrorist cell. They defeated the cell, but were fooled by a damsel in distress who was actually a member of the terrorist group. Havok woke up in a hospital, in the care of nurse Scarlett McKenzie, the assassin without disguise. She manipulated Havok and made him fall in love with her. Scarlett was working for the Russian terrorists, Dr. Neutron and Meltdown. Having previously failed to charge up Meltdown&#x27;s superpowers with the energy released from Chernobyl nuclear disaster, they wanted to use Havok as a conduit to channel the energy of an atomic reactor into Meltdown. Scarlett fed Havok with false information that terrorists were trying to sabotage a nuclear power station. When he ventured into the heart of the reactor, he found it reaching critical limit. According to plan, Havok tried to absorb the dangerous radiation; however, when he witnessed Meltdown killing Scarlett, he unleashed the energy into Meltdown bringing him up to full power. Wolverine arrived and prevented a full disaster by battling with Meltdown, while Havok continued to absorb energy from the reactor, still on the verge of explosion. Wolverine killed Meltdown by penetrating his body with multiple control rods that slowed down the nuclear reactions raging within him, and Havok redirected the nuclear radiation into space.

===Genosha===
Havok ultimately went through the Siege Perilous with several other X-Men fleeing the Reavers, the cyborg hunters. Havok ended up an amnesiac in Genosha, a country that used mutants and genetically-engineered slaves called Mutates. He became a high-ranking Magistrate in the Genoshan army. His fellow X-Men had no idea what had happened to him until, during the &quot;X-Tinction Agenda&quot;, the Genoshan government kidnapped members of the mutant teams X-Men, X-Factor and the New Mutants. During a pitched battle with Cyclops, Havok&#x27;s memory returned, but he kept it a secret hoping to catch the Genoshan leader, Cameron Hodge, off guard. He succeeded and delivered the killing blow to Hodge, yet he and Wolfsbane decided to remain in Genosha, as they wanted to help in rebuilding the once proud nation.

===X-Factor===
Havok and Wolfsbane were soon brought back from Genosha by Professor X and Cyclops as they wanted him to become the leader of the new government-sponsored X-Factor. He reunited with Polaris and Havok led the team effectively for quite some time. He dealt with the unwilling, unwitting affections of Wolfsbane, the physical problems of Strong Guy and various public relations disasters, such as the destruction of the Washington Monument. Much of the team&#x27;s bad image was orchestrated by Mister Sinister, his Nasty Boys and a mutant senator who could cause bad luck. He dealt physically with Random and personally, as they clashed for various reasons. He grew in new directions as a leader, once seemingly drinking poison in an effort to buck up the spirits of Strong Guy, who had been poisoned. (What Alex drank had been water).

Havok and X-Factor were called on to subvert a civil war aggravated by the Pantheon. In this instance, Alex physically challenged the Hulk. He soaked up the various energies that fuel Hulk and used them to bolster his plasma blasts, thereby gaining an advantage. It was the second time Havok had beaten the Hulk.

During this time, Havok&#x27;s team participated in the events of the Infinity War and the Infinity Crusade. Alex and Strong Guy participated the most in far reaching, reality altering cosmic battles.

Multiple Man had contracted the Legacy Virus in Genosha and later chose to undergo a seemingly mystical healing effort. Despite the procedure&#x27;s previous success with Wolfsbane, curing her of her unnatural love for Alex, Multiple Man perished. This hit Havok hard, as he felt responsible since Madrox was under his command. He left the team for Hawaii, where he and Polaris enjoyed a romantic honeymoon until Malice, Mr. Sinister and The Nasty Boys showed up. Reinforcements helped Havok and Polaris survive the villains. Shortly afterward, Strong Guy suffered a heart attack and ended up in stasis, and Wolfsbane left to be with her foster mother.

After the Age of Apocalypse event, Havok accidentally destroyed a dam and was forced back into his old containment suit. After new members Wild Child, Shard and Mystique were introduced to the team, Havok fought Random and was captured by the Dark Beast. He was brainwashed into serving Dark Beast and Onslaught. He broke free of the brainwashing, but used it as an opportunity to infiltrate the enemy and recreated a version of the Brotherhood of Mutants. He succeeded in defeating Dark Beast and attempted to mend fences with his former X-Factor teammates, specifically Polaris and Multiple Man (the man who had died had been a Madrox duplicate).

While Havok was attempting to reform X-Factor, one of his time-traveling team members, Greystone, created an experimental time travel device to return him to the future. It exploded in mid-air, seemingly killing Havok and Greystone in front of their teammates.

===Mutant X===
In actuality, Havok was cast into a parallel world where he was the leader of a drastically altered version of X-Factor, known as The Six. In this world, he was the leader of the original X-Men, since his brother Cyclops was abducted by the Shi&#x27;ar along with his parents. He found he was married to Madelyne Pryor, with whom he had a son named Scotty, and all his friends were twisted versions of the ones he knew. Despite being unfamiliar with this realm, Havok willingly took over the role of father for Scotty, though the boy knew he was not really his dad. Havok becomes leader of The Six and his adventures in this reality lead to a disaster which leaves most of the superhumans dead. Havok is able to save the world itself before being cast into black nothingness.

===Resurrection===
However, Havok was found back in the original reality in a coma. The X-Men were able to restore his psyche with the help of the son of Havok&#x27;s nurse, Annie Ghazikhanian. When he was reunited with Polaris, she asked him to marry her, to which he did not respond. Beast immediately congratulated them, and Havok said nothing further. Likely he felt he &quot;should&quot; want to marry Lorna, but did not love her as he had before. Unknown to Havok, Polaris, and Annie, Carter had used his telepathy to link Annie and Alex&#x27;s dreams while Alex was comatose. In their dreams, Havok and Annie fell in love, unknown to Alex but not Annie. Before his wedding, Scott tested Alex&#x27;s resolve by hiring a shapeshifter to morph into Annie, something that disturbed Alex very deeply. The night before the wedding, Alex had a dream convincing him that he now loved Annie. During the wedding, Alex stopped the proceedings and called off the marriage. Lorna, already affected by the incident at Genosha, tried to kill Annie and Carter, only to be stopped by Juggernaut and Havok.

Alex revealed to Annie that it was Carter who linked the two due to their loneliness and that Alex loved her. Despite the fact that Iceman had started a relationship with Annie, he expressed his feelings for Lorna.

Havok and Annie&#x27;s relationship continued until an impending attack on the X-Mansion at the hands of a new Brotherhood of Mutants led by Exodus. This caused Annie to leave Havok and take her son away from the X-Men, feeling it was no longer safe for the two to live at the mansion. She wanted Alex to come with them but his duty was to his team, so mother and son left for parts unknown.

===Decimation===
With Annie and Carter now gone, Havok&#x27;s mind seems to be mending, since he expressed interest in resuming his relationship with Polaris, who moved on after being rejected and was dating her former boyfriend Iceman. During the post-&quot;House of M&quot; storyline titled &quot;Decimation,&quot; many mutants lost their powers. When Polaris revealed that she had lost her powers, she left the X-Men, and Havok decided to leave with her. However, after he and Polaris encountered the creature called &quot;Daap&quot;, during which Lorna was abducted, Havok returned to the X-Mansion to see a sphinx bearing the face of Apocalypse.

He then returned to active duty to bring down Apocalypse with the remainder of his squad, composed of Rogue, Iceman, and new member Mystique. Havok single-handedly destroyed the antidote to Apocalypse&#x27;s meta-plague, which had been a key element in his plan to decimate the human population. Gambit was turned into a horseman and clashed with Havok and the other X-Men. During the last battle, Iceman struck down Polaris&#x27;s Pestilence form. As her esophagus closed down, Havok administered CPR to save her life but was infected with the meta-plague. Luckily, Emma Frost had saved some of the antidote that Havok destroyed earlier and cured him with it.

===The rise and fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire===
Havok was recruited by Professor X, along with Marvel Girl (Rachel Summers), Nightcrawler, Warpath, Darwin, and Polaris to participate in a space mission to stop Vulcan from unleashing his powers on the Shi&#x27;ar empire. Havok had recently been reunited with Corsair, his father, and brought him news about Vulcan. His current relationship with Polaris is still developing. Polaris seems to finally show concrete signs of forgiving Havok, telling him to &quot;just shut up and kiss&quot; her after the team won their first battle against the entire regiment of Shi&#x27;ar soldiers in their beginning struggle against D&#x27;Ken and in support of Lilandra. Although Havok initially rebuffs her advances, hesitant to &quot;start up again after&quot; everything that happened between them, Lorna says that he needs to &quot;blow off some steam&quot; and the scene ends with them kissing. During the final battle, Corsair tries to reason with his son Vulcan but Vulcan kills his father where he stands. Havok, enraged by this, launches an attack on his brother with intention of killing him but is easily defeated. In the end, Nightcrawler, Warpath, and Hepzibah get the injured Professor X and Darwin back to the ship, but Lilandra sends the ship back to Earth, leaving Havok and his teammates stranded.

Havok, along with Polaris, Rachel, Korvus, Ch&#x27;od, and Raza form a new team of Starjammers after the death of Corsair, dedicated to defeating Vulcan and restoring Lilandra to the throne.

===Starjammers===
The civil war between Vulcan&#x27;s forces and those loyal to the dethroned Lilandra rages on. Led by Havok and the Starjammers, Lilandra&#x27;s forces gradually whittle away at Vulcan&#x27;s forces, which are plagued by defections. The Shi&#x27;ar, contrary to Vulcan&#x27;s expectations, are not happy to have an outsider as their ruler. Vulcan is discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinces him that they will come to accept him.

Warned in advance of a rebel raid on Feather&#x27;s Edge, Vulcan and his fleet ambush the Starjammers. However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the &quot;Hammer&quot;, is destroyed by the Scy&#x27;ar Tal (translates as &quot;Death to the Shi&#x27;ar&quot;). Vulcan and Gladiator attack the leader of the Scy&#x27;ar Tal and are easily defeated, whereupon they retreat deeper into Shi&#x27;ar space. Marvel Girl makes contact with the Eldest Scy&#x27;ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy&#x27;ar Tal were originally called the M&#x27;Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi&#x27;ar attacked them and killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi&#x27;ar settled on their planet, took the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra and K&#x27;ythri. The M&#x27;Kraan then changed their name to Scy&#x27;ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather&#x27;s Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After that, Vulcan makes contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.

Under the ceasefire, the Shi&#x27;ar and the Starjammers decide to take out the Finality, thus crippling the Scy&#x27;ar&#x27;s biggest threat. Once Havok and Vulcan are in a position to destroy Finality, the Eldest Scy&#x27;ar tries to stop them. When Vulcan figures out how the Eldest is powered, he severs the connection that Eldest has with his brothers, making him powerless. Once the connection is severed, the Scy&#x27;ar become unorganized and the tide of the battle shifts to the Shi&#x27;ar. The Shi&#x27;ar then proceed to attack both the Scy&#x27;ar and the Starjammers. Meanwhile, Vulcan blasts Havok into a sun.

Vulcan decides to use Finality to destroy the Scy&#x27;ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet. Alex returns and, having absorbed enough power to burn Vulcan, decides to end things with him. While they battle, Rachel and Korvus try but fail to stop the beacon that will initiate the attack by the Shi&#x27;ar. The Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard end Alex&#x27;s battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity, threatening to kill them. Before surrendering, Alex destroys Finality. Alex and the Starjammers are then taken into Vulcan&#x27;s custody and placed in prison, while Rachel Summers remains free.

===Divided We Stand===
Alex and Lorna, along with the other captured Starjammers, are kept in a deep underwater prison below a planet&#x27;s surface. Alex and Lorna are tortured daily and forced to hear each other&#x27;s screams, and Alex is powerless as he&#x27;s nowhere near a star from which to draw his powers. Vulcan informs Havok of the events of Messiah Complex and that the baby is gone, Charles Xavier is dead, and the X-Men are no more (not knowing the full truth of the result). Alex laughs off Vulcan, seeing the baby as a beacon of hope.

===&quot;X-Men: Kingbreaker&quot; and &quot;War of Kings&quot;===
Despite ploys such as telling Havok that his teammates are dead and it was all Alex&#x27;s fault, Havok remains defiant. Alex Summers was last seen displaying energy coming from his left hand proving that he had at least some power left.

Havok allowed some time to go by, allegedly with these moments of exposure continuing, before making his move. Waiting until it was his mealtime and the guards slid the food through the door, he blasted it open, warning the guards to run. When they instead attacked, he mercilessly defeated them, killing both. Alex then raced into the depths of the complex searching for his teammates.

He had no problem locating the cells of his crew and liberating them from captivity. He then went in search of Lorna, defeating more guards along the way. Alex, with Raza and Ch&#x27;od in tow, made it to Lorna&#x27;s lab where Alex set her free. After receiving a thank-you kiss upon waking her, Havok surprised his team as he informed them of his true plan. Instead of running, they would wait; Vulkan would be coming to defeat them and Havok planned to kill him when he did.

===Realm of Kings===
Due to the incident of Rachel and Korvus both losing their connection to the Phoenix Force, Havok, Polaris, Rachel and Korvus have departed for Earth. According to Rachel, they are still &quot;half a universe away&quot; from Earth. Havok, Polaris, and Rachel return in &quot;X-Men Legacy&quot; #254, in which Rogue launches a rescue mission after Rachel sends a telepathic distress signal. Frenzy, Magneto, Gambit, and Rogue help de-brainwash Polaris and Havok from the mental control of the insect-like alien &quot;Friendless&quot;.

===Regenesis===
Havok and Polaris are seen joining Wolverine&#x27;s side due to Polaris wanting to keep herself away from her father Magneto. Shortly after they arrived back on Earth, the duo is encouraged by Wolverine to lead X-Factor Investigations after Jamie Madrox&#x27;s death. Jamie returns to life shortly after, but Havok remains with X-Factor for a while. Polaris decides to remain with the team even after he leaves.

===Uncanny Avengers===
During &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, Havok joined the Avengers, the X-Men, and Nova in the final battle against his brother. He is asked to lead the Avengers Unity Squad by Captain America, reasoning that the mutant race needs a new &#x27;spokesperson&#x27; with Xavier dead and Cyclops imprisoned, although Havok doubts his ability to fulfill such a role.

The Celestials destroyed Earth and mutants were relocated to &#x27;Planet X&#x27; by the machinations of Eimin—one of the children of the Celestial-infected Archangel and the latest Horseman of Pestilence. Havok married the Wasp (Janet van Dyne) and they had a daughter, Katie, but Katie is lost when she is captured by Kang the Conqueror after he helps the team avert this timeline by projecting their minds back into their past selves. Although Alex is left disfigured after the battle, he and Janet remain together, and are contacted by Immortus, who informs them that he can return their daughter to them if they take action at the right time and place to conceive her, but also warns them about the imminent threat posed by the Red Skull.

During the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, the Red Skull and Scarlet Witch accidentally morally invert various heroes and villains. Havok is among those affected by the inversion spell. He resigns from the Avengers Unity Division and reconciles with his brother. Havok remains corrupted after the other heroes and villains are returned to normal, where Havok and Sabretooth have been unintentionally &#x27;protected&#x27; from the reversion by a shield generated by Iron Man, prompting him to join Cyclops&#x27; team after using the Wasp as a hostage to escape.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Unlike Iron Man (who was apparently restored to normal after reality was reconstructed after the Incursions) and like Sabretooth, Havok remained inverted. Havok and Emma Frost are later seen observing the funeral of his brother Cyclops from afar. Because he does not believe his brother had become suicidal at all and was convinced that Scott was actually alive but in hiding, Emma tells him the truth about what truly happened in the confrontation with the Inhumans. Emma takes Alex to see his brother&#x27;s dead body and reveals that Scott was one of the victims of the Terrigenesis clouds. She used a telepathic projection of him to rally mutant attempts to destroy a Terrigenesis cloud, subsequently faking his death in a final confrontation with Black Bolt.

After the truth of Emma&#x27;s actions is revealed at the conclusion of the war against the Inhumans, which ended with Medusa destroying the Terrigenesis cloud to save the mutants, Havok saves Emma when the mutants and the Inhumans turn on her. Havok makes it clear that he is only doing this out of respect for his brother&#x27;s memory and his old feelings for Emma rather than forgiving her for what she did to Cyclops&#x27; reputation. Havok then began working with the White Queen, Bastion, and Miss Sinister to infect the world’s population with the Mothervine virus, thereby making mutants the dominant species on the planet until he was eventually inverted back to his normal self by Emma Frost and Lorna Dane, and Elixir soon afterward cured his scars.

===Dawn of X===
In the new status quo for mutants post-&quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;, Professor X and Magneto invite all mutants to live on Krakoa and welcome even former enemies into their fold. He spends some time with his family in the Summer House, the new residence of the Summers Family, located on the Moon.

Later, he joins a loose group of outcast mutants, operating under Mister Sinister: the Hellions, which also comprise Wild Child, Kwannon, Empath, John Greycrow, Nanny, and Orphan Maker.

==Powers and abilities==
Havok is a mutant possessing the power to absorb ambient cosmic energy, process it, and emanate it from his body as waves of energy that heat the air in their path, turning it into plasma in the form of a beam with a tell-tale concentric circle pattern. These waves will emanate from his body in all directions unless he purposefully tries to channel them in a single direction, usually along the length of his arms. This results in control over an extremely powerful sort of destructive force. He is immune to the adverse effects of most forms of radiation and heat. In the past, he was not entirely able to control this ability, which made him a danger to those around him unless he wore a special containment suit equipped with special sensors for measuring and controlling his power output.

Despite past accounts, the energy that Havok releases is not truly a concussive force. When Havok strikes an object with hot plasma, the sudden temperature jump often causes objects to shatter or disintegrate. Should Havok direct his energy at the lowest level, he can project it toward a human being and his target will suffer a severe headache but will not burn up.

While his absorption capabilities are normally passive, he can also willingly absorb, store, and re-process various other energies from other sources through conscious force of will (such as starlight, x-rays, and gamma radiation). He once absorbed the whole energies of a collapsing star to fight his brother Vulcan, and actually beat the Hulk twice, once with a tightly focused beam to the forehead, and once by absorbing parts of his gamma energy during an invasion of Transia.

Nonetheless, Havok&#x27;s body is constantly absorbing cosmic radiation. When his body reaches its capacity, excess energy is then immediately re-emitted in negligible quantities. The circle on his chest is an indicator of how much energy he has left. Upon the expenditure of all his available energy, it takes Havok about 17 hours to recharge to peak level under normal circumstances. The concentration involved in releasing his energy in focused beams is exhausting for Havok, especially if he does it over an extended period.

Havok can also use stored energy for flight by directing it as a downward thrust. At full energy capacity, he has an easier time managing his energized propulsion through his powers. By emanating plasma from his body in directed waves, he can form a sort of shield against projectile weapons for a short time.

Havok has demonstrated immunity to his brother Cyclops&#x27;s optic beam. Similarly, Cyclops is immune to Havok&#x27;s power.

Havok has the normal human strength, height, and build of a man who engages in intensive regular exercise. Havok is well-educated in the field of geophysical science, where he has earned a master&#x27;s degree and completed some doctoral work, and he has been trained in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts by Wolverine. He is an instinctive tactician and strategist.

It was also revealed in the &quot;Mutant X&quot; and &quot;Exiles&quot; books that his body and mind were a nexus for all other Alex Summers in other realities and his very existence is sort of a &quot;back door&quot; to the others. This revelation caused the problem in the &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; and &quot;Exiles&quot; crossover. Not much more is known about his multidimensional status.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Havok 12th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse continuity, Alex and his brother Scott are not separated after the plane crash but adopted together by Sinister. Raised together as the cream of the new mutant aristocracy in Apocalypse&#x27;s America, the brothers, under the rank of Prelate, work to oversee their foster father&#x27;s interests. Alex, being the more emotional and thus unstable of the two, loses ground in Sinister&#x27;s eyes and watches with envy as his brother gains favor.

The two brothers reunite briefly with their real father, Christopher Summers, who has been kept in Sinister&#x27;s medical labs. They discover that Christopher had been infected by the Brood and was transforming into the new Brood Queen, forcing Scott to kill him. Alex refuses to believe that there were no other options and blames his brother for their father&#x27;s death.

Alex meets Lorna once, but they have no relationship other than that of jail warden and prisoner. The power-hungry Alex is arrogant about his powers both as a mutant and as a Prelate. He frequents the club which Angel owns, Heaven, and has an affair with the club&#x27;s diva, a flatscan (or human) woman named Scarlett (presumably that reality&#x27;s version of the woman who appeared in the &quot;Meltdown&quot; miniseries). Because of the antagonism between humans and mutants, they both must keep this affair a secret. Scarlett, it turns out, is a spy working for the Human High Council. Scarlett is arrested right after she discovers that she is pregnant with Alex&#x27;s child.

At almost that moment, Alex has just recaptured Jean Grey to use against his brother, Scott. Indeed, when Jean was originally a prisoner, she had captivated Scott and inspired him to release other prisoners. Alex exposes his brother as a traitor by asking Scott to execute Jean Grey, which Scott refuses to do. Following this, Alex has Scott arrested and gives him over to the Dark Beast for experiments; however, Jean Grey and Scott escape. Alex tracks them down and knocks out his brother and seemingly kills Jean, but this action proves fatal for Alex when Weapon X takes vengeance on Jean&#x27;s behalf.

===Age of Ultron===
When Wolverine kills Hank Pym to avert the future in which Ultron nearly annihilated the human race in the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; reality, a new timeline where Morgan le Fay conquered half the world is created in which Havok relinquished his birthname and married Rogue. He worked as leader of the Morlocks until he was killed by Archangel&#x27;s son Uriel of the Apocalypse Twins.

===Marvel Zombies===
In &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; #23, Havok is seen as one of the zombies attacking the surviving humans.

===Mys-Tech Wars===
In the four-issue series &quot;Mys-Tech Wars&quot;, an alternate universe version of Havok, along with the rest of X-Factor, appear in order to assist the mainstream heroes in their battles. An enemy&#x27;s energy bolt pierces Havok through the neck, killing him instantly.

===New Exiles===
On the world of the Sons of Iron and Daughters of the Dragon, the New Exiles face a squad of alternate &#x27;core X-Men&#x27; who are loyal to Lilandra. These X-Men include an alternate version of Alex who is codenamed &#x27;Warshot&#x27;. Alex is covered from head to toe in battle armor and combines his mutant powers with his weaponry.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel continuity of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, Alex Summers, a.k.a. Havok, is the headstrong, brash field leader of the Academy of Tomorrow, the mutant peacekeeping squad of Emma Frost. In this incarnation, he is the boyfriend and teammate of Polaris.

In this incarnation, he also is the brother of Cyclops. As in the mainstream comics, their powers are useless on each other. However, there are several key differences: first, Alex is sometimes called the older brother and other times called the younger brother; second, in this world, Alex and Scott are frequently at odds with each other, both ideologically and physically; and third, neither seems interested in mending this rift. Ideologically, their rift was evidenced by Alex&#x27;s affiliation with Emma Frost&#x27;s Academy of Tomorrow. There is also more than one reference to their physical competition over Polaris. In one case, Alex even knocked out Scott with a wrench, though he states that this was because Scott let him. The two have shown to help each other in great danger, but in general, they have a lot of sibling issues separating them.

During the Ultimatum event, the Academy of Tomorrow is attacked and everyone inside is killed by Madrox, but Alex&#x27;s body isn&#x27;t found and he is listed as missing in action after the end of the event. Alex is later revealed not only to be alive but also a patient in Kennerman Acres mental institute; he suffers from amnesia but has recollections of an explosion and his only company is an imaginary version of his brother Scott. Alex is eventually found by Nathaniel Essex (who can see the imaginary version of Scott) and brought to Roxxon where Essex introduces him to Layla Miller as one of the four mutants they needed for their unknown plans.

===X-Men: The End===
In the alternate future &quot;X-Men: The End&quot;, Carter creates an illusion that he is still a child and Havok and Annie are together. Both Havok and Annie are killed prior to the beginning of the series.

=== Baegyangsa Temple ===
A head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, Baegyangsa (백양사; 白羊寺) was established in 632 AD by the great Zen Master Yeohwan (여환선사; 如幻禪師). Originally named Baegamsa (백암사; 白巖寺), it was renamed Jeongtosa (정토사; 淨土寺) in 1034 by the monk Jungyeon (중연; 中延), who spearheaded a reconstruction of the temple. It got its current name after the mid-Joseon period. The renowned Seon Buddhist nun and chef, Jeong Kwan, lives in the temple. Visitors can also participate in its Templestay program.

=== Pilam Seowon ===
Founded in 1590 to commemorate a local scholar and civil servant Kim In-hu (김인후; 金麟厚, 1510-1560), Pilam Seowon ko] (필암서원; 筆巖書院) was burned down in 1597 during the Imjin War. It was rebuilt in 1624, and in 1662, King Hyeongjong personally gave a plaque containing the temple&#x27;s name. In 1672 it moved to its current location. Besides being a designated Historic Site of Korea, it is also one of the nine &quot;seowons&quot; that was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 6, 2019.

This &quot;seowon&quot; is built in the Jeonhakhumyo (전학후묘; 前學後廟) form, where the study area is located in the front, and the area for performing ancestral rites are at the back. A number of old documents are stored here, from records of students and personnel to woodblock print collections of cultural property status.

=== Ibamsanseong Fortress ===
Built on the mountain Ibamsan (626m), the exact founding of Ibamsanseong Fortress ko] (입암산성; 笠岩山城) is unclear, although it is first mentioned in the History of Goryeo, where, in 1256 during the Mongol invasions of Korea, General Song Gunbi ko] (송군비; 宋君斐, ?-1270) who was in charge of this fortress, successfully defeated the Mongols. The fortress was rebuilt in 1409 during King Taejong&#x27;s reign, and later it underwent several modifications to allow its defenders to hold out for an extended period of time. Today, 3.2km of the fortress remains.

=== Jangseong Hwangryong Battle Site ===
This is the site of the Battle of Hwangryong River, part of the Donghak Peasant Revolution. From 1994, the county government began building a memorial park in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the revolution, and in 1997 it was opened to the public, being designated as National Historic Site No. 406 in 1998. There is also a monument to Lee Hak-seung, a general of the government troops who was killed in action.

=== Hong Gil-dong Theme Park ===
This theme park introduces visitors to Hong Gil-dong, who was assumed to be born in Jangseong-gun. Facilities include an archery range, an exhibition hall, 4D theater, futsal field, a camping site for both tents and vehicles, a &quot;hanok&quot;, a store and a restaurant.

=== Namchang Valley ===
At four kilometers long, this large valley consists of six smaller valleys; within its vicinity lies Ibamsanseong Fortress and Baegyangsa Temple. Waterfalls and oddly-shaped rocks dot its hiking trail. During summer, it is popular with hikers as they immerse themselves in nature.

=== Chungnyeongsan Cypress Forest ===
The area around Chungnyeongsan (축령산; 祝靈山), a mountain which height is 620.5m, saw a successful afforestation project under Chunwon (춘원; 春園) Im Jung-guk (임종국; 林種國, 1915-1987), who in 1956 began to plant trees at the foot of the mountain, entirely at his own expense. His determination endured even in the face of a severe drought in 1968. Eventually, nearby villagers volunteered to help him, and over the course of 20 years approximately 1,150 hectares of land had turned into a cypress forest, with over 2.5 million trees being planted by him alone. After dying from illness, his body was buried here. The Korea Forest Service purchased the forest in 2002 and has maintained it ever since. Because of his actions, Chungnyeongsan is now a famous tourist attraction, with a folk village and tourist farm built at the entrance. Nearby villages also benefit from increased tourism. 

In 2024, a &quot;changgeuk&quot; performance depicting Im Jung-guk&#x27;s life story and his dedication to the forest was held at Jangseong Cultural Arts Center, to raise awareness of sustainable regional development.

==May 2014 fire==
A fire at a 397-bed hospital, which had opened in 2007 in Jangseong was the scene of a major fire just after midnight on 28 May 2014. Twenty one patients and a nurse died in the fire, while several more people were injured.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Jangseong is twinned with:

* Jung-gu, South Korea 
* Haman County, South Korea 
* Gwacheon, South Korea

<doc id="393889" wikidata="Q1521059" url="?curid=393889" title="Tullamarine, Victoria">
<text>Tullamarine ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Brimbank, Hume and Merri-bek local government areas. Tullamarine recorded a population of 6,733 at the .

The suburb is a collection of recent housing estates and light industry. Generally flat and exposed to the hot northerly winds of Melbourne&#x27;s summer, as well as cold southerly winds in winter, its most notable feature is the nearby Melbourne Airport. Tullamarine&#x27;s residential area is contained in a circular loop of the Moonee Ponds Creek, and its western boundary is the Melbourne Airport. Tullamarine contains the smaller residential area of Gladstone Park. The Albion-Jacana railway line separates Tullamarine from Airport West to the south.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name is thought to derive from Tullamareena, a young member of the Wurundjeri (who later in 1838 escaped from the first Melbourne Gaol, burning it down in the process) according to Reverend Langhorne, an advisor to the first government surveyor, Robert Hoddle. Forty years ago the area was named as Toolimerin.

===19th century===
Tullamarine Village was on Bulla or Lancefield Road, which is now Melrose Drive. It was positioned at the intersection of three municipal boundaries (Broadmeadows, Bulla and Keilor), which came together at Victoria Street and Melrose Drive. The primary school was on land now in the airport (south of Victoria Street) and the post office was near the present-day Tullamarine Reserve. Originally Tullamarine extended westwards to the Organ Pipes National Park, and the nearby area bounded by the Maribyrnong River, Jacksons Creek and Deep Creek was called Tullamarine Island because of the difficulties faced by inhabitants in getting across the watercourses during wet weather.

When the land in the Tullamarine Parish was subdivided into farm lots in 1842 only one lot sold, and the rest were sold by selection in 1850. A Wesleyan school was opened in 1855 and two other schools in 1859 and 1864. The Wesleyan one continued until the State primary school was opened in 1884. Tullamarine Post Office opened on 4 March 1859. By 1865 Tullamarine had a hotel and a district population of about 200 persons.

Section 1 of the parish of Tullamarine was just over the river from Keilor. Its most noted occupants were Edward Wilson, editor of &quot;The Argus&quot;, and an acclimatation enthusiast, and Robert McDougall, a famed breeder of the Booth strain of Shorthorns. Section 2, Annandale, gave Annandale Road its name. Its most noted occupant was Bill Parr. Section 3 was granted to William Foster and became known as the Springs. His younger brother J.F.L.Foster took it, and section 21 Doutta Galla (south of Sharps Road) over later while he was acting Governor and the homestead on 21DG was called the Governor&#x27;s House by locals. Section 21 became James Sharp&#x27;s &quot;Hillside&quot; and the Crotty family&#x27;s dairy farm called Broomfield. The southern part of Section 3 became the Reddans&#x27; &quot;Brightview&quot; and Tommy Loft&#x27;s &quot;Dalkeith&quot;. The Wesleyan School was near the bend in Cherie Street and the Methodist Church was on the south corner of Post office Lane at the northern boundary of Section 3. Also on Section 3 was the Junction Hotel.

Between Broadmeadows-Mickleham Rd and the Moonee Moonee Ponds was section 4, the southern half of which became E. E. Kenny&#x27;s &quot;Camp Hill&quot; because diggers bound for the goldfields camped on his property. Eventually the part west of Bulla Rd (Melrose Drive) was sold off and became (Samuel) Mansfield&#x27;s Triangle. The northern half of section 4 became Edmond Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Viewpoint&quot;. It was between Mickleham Road and the creek, north of Camp Hill Park to the Lackenheath Drive corner. North of Viewpoint was &quot;Stewarton&quot; whose occupant (1846–1855) was Peter McCracken, who later had a dairy in Kensington and built Ardmillan in Moonee Ponds. He was followed by John Kerr and, from 1892, by John Cock. A later prominent owner was Jim Barrow who had the first tractor in the district. Stewarton was renamed Gladstone and now, with Viewpoint, comprises the of Gladstone Park.

On the west side of Broadmeadows Road (now Mickleham Road) was section 6. This and section 15 (north to the Westmeadows Football Ground) were granted to John Carre Riddell, after whom Riddells Creek was named. The land from Freight Road to the creek was a farm called Chandos (after which a street was named in nearby Attwood) but in the early 1900s John Cock divided it into three farms; from the north, Judd&#x27;s Chandos, Lockhart&#x27;s &quot;Springburn&quot; and Wright&#x27;s &quot;Strathconnan&quot;.

Section 7 was to the west and was granted to John Pascoe Fawkner. As Bulla Road bisected sections 6 and 7, Fawkner and Riddell swapped land so that Fawkner&#x27;s was now to the south west and Riddell&#x27;s to the north east. Fawkner divided his land into blocks to enable his beloved yeoman farmers to obtain a block. James Henry Parr consolidated many of the blocks to form his farm &quot;The Elms&quot;. Nearer to Grants Lane was the Loves&#x27; dairy farm. Riddell&#x27;s land became Wallace Wright&#x27;s &quot;Sunnyside&quot; (later Heaps) and Charles Nash&#x27;s &quot;Fairview&quot;. The area bounded by Derby Street as far north of Springbank was called Hamilton Terrace after Riddell&#x27;s partner and subdivided into acre blocks. At the suggestion of Alec Rasmussen, the Tullamarine Progress Association bought Noah Holland&#x27;s 6 acres and donated what is now called Tullamarine Reserve to Broadmeadows Shire in late 1929. A triangular part of section 15, now containing the airport terminal, later became the Paynes&#x27; &quot;Scone&quot;.

Most of the airport is now on Section 14, &quot;Gowrie Park&quot;, owned by the Ritchies of Aucholzie, James Lane and Donovan during most of the years until airport acquisitions began. Gowrie Park Drive recalls this farm. Section 8, east of McNabs Road and south of Grants Lane, was granted to John Grant and the McNabs. Grant&#x27;s farm, the northern half, was called &quot;Seafield&quot; and the McNabs had two farms, Victoria Bank and Oakbank but the middle farm was absorbed into Oakbank. The two families are credited with introducing Ayrshire cattle into Australia. The Seafield School was where the runway crosses the line of Grants Lane.

Across McNabs Road was Fox&#x27;s Barbiston and on the North of Barbiston Road, the McNabs&#x27; second Victoria Bank (later owned by journalist Cornelius Percy Blom) and the Ritchies&#x27; Aucholzie. On both sides of Mansfields Road were farms owned by the descendants of David Mansfield. North of these farms was &quot;Glenara&quot; owned by Alister Clark, the breeder of the Black Rose and first Chairman of the Moonee Valley Racing Club until his death.

The three great leaders in Tullamarine&#x27;s history were Alec Rasmussen, Major Murphy and Leo Dineen. The Spring Street Reserve was renamed after Leo because of his efforts to establish various sporting clubs and facilities. Alec Rasmussen was responsible for the progress association purchasing the Melrose Drive Reserve and donating it to Council. Walter Murphy moved two war memorials and Ann Greene&#x27;s church as well as leading fire-risk-lessening burn offs (sources below).

The Tullamarine Methodist Church (just north of Trade Park Drive) was built in 1870 and managed to reach its centenary plus about two decades. Its stained glass windows were incorporated into the Uniting Church in Carrick Drive, Gladstone Park. Tullamarine State School 2613 was on the north corner of Conders Lane (Link Rd) but was relocated onto &quot;Dalkeith&quot; circa 1961 and given a new number. The Progress Association was formed in 1924 at a meeting convened by Tom Loft of Dalkeith (See The Argus 19 8 1924 page 13.). Tennis was played at the Johnson&#x27;s Glendewar (east of the Airport Terminal buildings) until they moved to Cumberland (See The Argus 23 7 1914, page 4.). An application to play Sunday tennis at Tullamarine (Argus 1 9 1939 page 15) was refused but there is no evidence in newspapers of organised tennis apart from the above. By the 1930s, there was less demand for hay so pig farmers such as Heaps, Lacy and Payne (on the Airport Terminal site) became more common.

===20th century===
By the 1930s the Tullamarine Village also had a church, tennis and football clubs and a progress association. The chief activities were hay production and grazing. During the mid-1950s Tullamarine Village became an agricultural and residential township. Later in that decade the Federal Government announced that it was examining a site north and west of the township for a new airport, and land acquisition began in the early 1960s. The school was moved to a new site in 1961.

In 1955 the Village Drive-In was opened with one screen and a capacity of 862 Cars. The drive-in closed in 1984 and the site was developed into a housing estate with streets named after famous film studios such as Forum and Paramount.

Between 1967 and 1970 Tullamarine Freeway was built, dividing Tullamarine from its eastern area, which is Gladstone Park. The part west of the freeway has housing, a large industrial estate and is skirted by the Western Ring Road with interchanges where it crosses the freeway.

In 1988, Anthony Rowhead of F.A.C. developed a scheme to rename roadways within the airport after aborigines, and pioneers of Tullamarine and aviation. It was fully developed when it was cancelled at the last moment with no reason given, with Gowrie Park Drive the only named road. It was named after the farm owned by James Lane in the 1920s when it was used as a landing ground by those daring young men who would visit the Inverness Hotel (near the north end of the runway). When Donovans had the farm during World War II, planes were parked there overnight in case a bombing raid struck Essendon Aerodrome.

===21st century===
Sharps Road, which runs east–west near the southern border of Tullamarine, was until the late 1980s a single carriageway road. On its southern side was a line of tall pine trees hiding a small pony club. Today, Sharps Road is a dual-carriageway road running adjacent to the Western Ring Road to Melbourne Airport.

In 1987 the median house price in Tullamarine was 97% of the median for metropolitan Melbourne, and in 1996 it was 82% of the metropolitan median.

<doc id="393892" wikidata="Q623873" url="?curid=393892" title="Vostok programme">
<text>The Vostok programme (; , , translated as &quot;East&quot;) was a Soviet human spaceflight project to put the first Soviet cosmonauts into low Earth orbit and return them safely. Competing with the United States Project Mercury, it succeeded in placing the first human into space, Yuri Gagarin, in a single orbit in Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961. The Vostok capsule was developed from the Zenit spy satellite project, and its launch vehicle was adapted from the existing R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) design. The name &quot;Vostok&quot; was treated as classified information until Gagarin&#x27;s flight was first publicly disclosed to the world press.

The programme carried out six crewed spaceflights between 1961 and 1963. The longest flight lasted nearly five days, and the last four were launched in pairs, one day apart. This exceeded Project Mercury&#x27;s demonstrated capabilities of a longest flight of just over 34 hours, and of single missions.

Vostok was succeeded by two Voskhod programme flights in 1964 and 1965, which used three- and two-man modifications of the Vostok capsule and a larger launch rocket.

==Background==

The world&#x27;s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, had been put into orbit by the Soviets in 1957. The next milestone in the history of space exploration would be to put a human in space, and both the Soviets and the Americans wanted to be the first.

==Cosmonaut selection and training==

By January 1959, the Soviets had begun preparations for human spaceflight. Physicians from the Soviet Air Force insisted that the potential cosmonaut candidates be qualified Air Force pilots, arguing that they would have relevant skills such as exposure to higher g-forces, as well as ejection seat experience; also the Americans had chosen the Mercury Seven in April 1959, all of whom had aviation backgrounds. The candidates had to be intelligent, comfortable in high-stress situations, and physically fit.

Chief designer of the Soviet space program, Sergei Korolev, decided that the cosmonauts must be male, between 25 and 30 years old, no taller than 1.75 meters, and weigh no more than 72 kilograms. The final specifications for cosmonauts were approved in June 1959. By September interviews with potential cosmonauts had begun. Although the pilots were not told they might be flying into space, one of the physicians in charge of the selection process believed that some pilots had deduced this. Just over 200 candidates made it through the interview process, and by October a series of demanding physical tests were conducted on those remaining, such as exposure to low pressures, and a centrifuge test. By the end of 1959, 20 men had been selected. Korolev insisted on having a larger group than NASA&#x27;s astronaut team of seven. Of these 20, five were outside the desired age range; hence, the age requirement was relaxed. Unlike NASA&#x27;s astronaut group, this group did not particularly consist of experienced pilots; Belyayev was the most experienced with 900 flying hours. The Soviet spacecraft were more automated than the American counterparts, so significant piloting experience was not necessary.

On January 11, 1960, Soviet Chief Marshal of Aviation Konstantin Vershinin approved plans to establish the Cosmonaut Training Center, whose exclusive purpose would be to prepare the cosmonauts for their upcoming flights; initially the facility would have about 250 staff. Vershinin assigned the already famous aviator Nikolai Kamanin to supervise operations at the facility. By March, most of the cosmonauts had arrived at the training facility; Vershinin gave a welcome speech on March 7, and those who were present were formally inducted into the cosmonaut group. By mid-June all twenty were permanently stationed at the center. In March the cosmonauts were started on a daily fitness regime, and were taught classes on topics such as rocket space systems, navigation, geophysics, and astronomy.

Owing to the initial facility&#x27;s space limitations, the cosmonauts and staff were relocated to a new facility in Star City (then known as &quot;Zelenyy&quot;), which has been the home of Russia&#x27;s cosmonaut training program for over 60 years. The move officially took place on June 29, 1960.

===Vanguard Six===
At the Gromov Flight Research Institute, a spacecraft simulator had been built, called the &quot;TDK-1&quot;. Owing to the inefficiency of training all 20 cosmonauts in the simulator, it was decided they would select six men who would go through accelerated training. This group, which would be known as &quot;The Vanguard Six&quot;, was decided on May 30, 1960, and initially consisted of Gagarin, Kartashov, Nikolayev, Popovich, Titov, and Varlamov. Alexei Leonov recalls that these six were the shortest of the group of 20.

In July, shortly after relocation to Star City, two of the six were replaced on medical grounds. Firstly, during a centrifuge test of 8 &quot;g&quot;, Kartashov experienced some internal damage, causing minor hemorrhaging on his back. Despite Gagarin&#x27;s requests for him to stay, the doctors decided to remove Kartashov from the group of six. Later in July, Varlamov was involved in a swimming accident. During a dive into a lake near the training center, he hit his head on the bottom, displacing a cervical vertebra. So by the end of July, the Vanguard Six were: Gagarin, Bykovskiy, Nelyubov, Nikolayev, Popovich, and Titov.

By January 1961, these six had all finished parachute and recovery training, as well as three-day regimes in simulators. On January 17, the six participated in their final exams, including time spent in a simulator, and a written test. Based on these results, a commission, supervised by Kamanin, recommended the use of the cosmonauts in the following order: Gagarin, Titov, Nelyubov, Nikolayev, Bykovskiy, Popovich. At this stage Gagarin was the clear favorite to be the first man in space, not only based on the exams, but also among an informal peer evaluation.

==Missions==
Vostok 1, the first human spaceflight in April 1961, was preceded by several preparatory flights. In mid-1960, the Soviets learned that the Americans could launch a sub-orbital human spaceflight as early as January 1961. Korolev saw this as an important deadline, and was determined to launch a crewed orbital mission before the Americans launched their human suborbital mission. By April 1960, designers at Sergei Korolev&#x27;s design bureau, then known as &quot;OKB-1&quot;, had completed a draft plan for the first Vostok spacecraft, called &quot;Vostok 1K&quot;. This design would be used for testing purposes; also in their plan was &quot;Vostok 2K&quot;, a spy satellite that would later become known as Zenit 2, and &quot;Vostok 3K&quot;, which would be used for all six crewed Vostok missions.

Despite the very large geographical size of the Soviet Union, there were obvious limitations to monitoring orbital spaceflights from ground stations within the country. To remedy this, the Soviets stationed about seven naval vessels, or tracking ships, around the world. For each ground station or tracking ship, the duration of communications with an orbiting spacecraft was limited to between five and ten minutes.

===Korabl-Sputnik 1===

The first &quot;Vostok&quot; spacecraft was a variant not designed to be recovered from orbit; the variant was also called &quot;Vostok 1KP&quot; (or &quot;1P&quot;). At Korolev&#x27;s suggestion, the media would call the spacecraft &quot;Korabl-Sputnik&quot;, (&quot;Satellite-ship&quot;); the name &quot;Vostok&quot; was still a secret codename at this point. This first Vostok spacecraft was successfully sent into orbit on May 15, 1960. Owing to a system malfunction, on the spacecraft&#x27;s 64th orbit the thrusters fired and sent it into an even higher orbit. The orbit eventually decayed, and it re-entered the atmosphere several years later.

===Vostok 1K===

The next six launches were all of the &quot;Vostok 1K&quot; design, equipped with life-support facilities, and planned to be recovered after orbit. The first spacecraft launched on July 28, 1960 carried two space dogs named Chayka and Lisichka. An explosion destroyed the spacecraft shortly after launch, killing both dogs, and the mission was not given a name. The next mission, designated Korabl-Sputnik 2, was launched on August 19, 1960, carrying two more dogs, Belka and Strelka, as well as a variety of other biological specimens such as mice, insects, and strips of human skin. This mission was successful, and Belka and Strelka became the first living beings recovered from orbit. The spacecraft was only the second object ever to have been recovered from orbit, the first being the return capsule of the American Discoverer 13 the previous week. During the mission there was some concern for Belka and Strelka&#x27;s health, after images of Belka vomiting had been obtained from the onboard cameras. The spacecraft and dogs were recovered following the 26-hour spaceflight, and extensive physiological tests revealed that the dogs were in good health. This represented a significant success for the Vostok programme.

The success of Korabl-Sputnik 2 gave the designers confidence to put forward a plan leading to a human spaceflight. A document regarding a plan for the Vostok programme, dated September 10, 1960, and declassified in 1991, was sent to the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and approved by Premier Nikita Khrushchev. This document had been signed by the top leaders in the Soviet defence industry at the time, the most senior being Deputy Chairman Dmitriy Ustinov; this indicated the elevated importance of the document. The plan called for one or two more &quot;Vostok 1K&quot; flights, followed by two uncrewed &quot;Vostok 3K&quot; flights, followed by a crewed flight in December 1960.

A major setback occurred on October 24, when a rocket explosion killed over 100 people, including Chief Marshal of Artillery Mitrofan Nedelin, in what is now called the Nedelin catastrophe. This was one of the worst disasters in the history of spaceflight. It involved a rocket that was not designed by Korolev, and was not necessary for the Vostok programme; the rocket was by rival designer Mikhail Yangel, intended to be a new generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles. It would be two weeks before work on the Vostok programme continued, and it was realised that the original target of a December crewed launch was unrealistic.

On December 1, 1960, the next &quot;Vostok 1K&quot; spacecraft, called Korabl-Sputnik 3 by the press, was launched. It carried the two dogs Pchyolka and Mushka. After about 24 hours, the engines were intended to fire to begin re-entry, but they fired for less time than had been expected. This meant that the spacecraft would enter the atmosphere, but not over Soviet territory. For this reason the self-destruct system was activated, and the spacecraft and the two dogs were destroyed. At the time, the press reported that an incorrect altitude caused the cabin to be destroyed upon re-entry.

The next &quot;Vostok 1K&quot; spacecraft was launched on December 22, 1960, but it was unnamed because it failed to reach orbit. It carried two dogs, named Kometa and Shutka. The third stage of the launch system malfunctioned, and the emergency escape system was activated. The spacecraft landed 3,500 kilometres downrange of the launch site. The resulting rescue operation took several days, in -40 °C conditions. After a few days, the dogs were both recovered alive, and the spacecraft was returned to Moscow a few weeks later. Despite Korolev&#x27;s desire to announce this failure to the press, the State Commission vetoed the idea.

===Vostok 3KA===

The two uncrewed missions immediately preceding the first human flight used the same spacecraft design as in the crewed missions, a design called &quot;Vostok 3KA&quot; (or &quot;3A&quot;). The only differences were that they would carry a single dog into orbit, a life-size mannequin would be strapped into the main ejection seat, and (unlike the crewed missions) they had a self-destruct system. The recent failures of Vostok 1K were not encouraging, but it was decided to proceed with launches of an automated variant of &quot;Vostok 3KA&quot;, the spacecraft design that would conduct a human spaceflight. The approval of a crewed mission was contingent upon the success of the two automated &quot;Vostok 3KA&quot; missions. Unlike the previous &quot;Vostok 1K&quot; flights, the two uncrewed &quot;Vostok 3KA&quot; flights were planned to last only a single orbit, to imitate the plan for the first human flight.

The first of these uncrewed flights, Korabl-Sputnik 4, was launched on March 9, 1961. It carried the dog Chernushka into orbit, as well as a mannequin called Ivan Ivanovich, who wore a functioning SK-1 spacesuit. The dog was contained in a small pressurized sphere, which also contained 80 mice, several guinea pigs, and other biological specimens. Additional mice, guinea pigs, and other specimens were placed within the mannequin. After one orbit, the descent module successfully re-entered the atmosphere, the mannequin was safely ejected, and the dog and other specimens landed separately in the descent module by parachute. The spaceflight lasted 106 minutes, and the dog was recovered alive after landing. The mission was a complete success.

On March 23, before the next mission, an accident occurred during training which led to the death of cosmonaut candidate Valentin Bondarenko. He was burned in a fire in an oxygen-rich isolation chamber, and died in a hospital eight hours after the incident. Bondarenko&#x27;s death was the first known cosmonaut or astronaut fatality. It is not clear whether other cosmonauts were told of his death immediately; the media did not learn of Bondarenko&#x27;s death – or even of his existence – until many years later, in 1986. Unsubstantiated reports of other cosmonaut deaths created the myth of the lost cosmonaut.
The next uncrewed flight, Korabl-Sputnik 5, was launched on March 25, two days after Bondarenko&#x27;s death. Like the previous &quot;Vostok 3KA&quot; flight, it lasted for only a single orbit, carried a mannequin and many animals, which included frogs, plants, mice, rats, and a dog, Zvezdochka (&quot;Starlet&quot;, or &quot;Little star&quot;). This mission was also a complete success, which was the final step required to get approval for a crewed mission. The re-entry module of the Korabl-Sputnik 5 spacecraft, also called &quot;Vostok 3KA-2&quot;, was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s on April 12, 2011, the 50th anniversary of the first human spaceflight, Vostok 1. Evgeny Yurchenko, a Russian investment banker, paid $2,882,500 for the capsule.

===Crewed flights===
===Cancelled missions===
One different (1963) and seven original (going through to April 1966) Vostok flights were originally planned:
*Vostok 6A - pair to Vostok 5 group flight with female cosmonaut instead fulfilled Vostok 6 flight 
*Vostok 7 - 8-days high-altitude flight for radiological-biological studies with natural re-entry from orbit 
*Vostok 8 - pair to Vostok 9 10-days group high-altitude flight for extended scientific studies with natural re-entry from orbit 
*Vostok 9 - pair to Vostok 8 10-days group high-altitude flight for extended scientific studies with natural re-entry from orbit 
*Vostok 10 - 10-days high-altitude flight for extended scientific studies with natural re-entry from orbit 
*Vostok 11 - supplemental flight for extra-vehicular activity tests 
*Vostok 12 - supplemental flight for extra-vehicular activity tests 
*Vostok 13 - 10-days high-altitude flight for extended scientific studies with natural re-entry from orbit 

All these original missions were cancelled in early 1964 and the components recycled into the Voskhod programme, which was intended to achieve more Soviet firsts in space.

<text>Jindo County (&quot;Jindo-gun&quot;) is a county in South Jeolla Province, South Korea. It consists of the island of Jindo and several smaller nearby islands. Jindo Bridge connects Jindo county with Haenam county.

Together with Jindo Island, Jindo County contains an archipelago of about 230 small islands, of which only 45 are inhabited by 4,855 people. Women made up 50.4% of the total county population of 29,538 in 2015. Most of the land is covered by forests (60%) and cultivated fields (30%). The county tree is &quot;Malchilus thunbergii&quot;, the flower camellia and the bird the swan. The local food specialties are wolfberry, which is used for liquor, tea and paste; cheongju red-colored rice wine, brown seaweed and black rice.

<text>The following is a list of national constitutions by country, semi-recognized countries, and by codification.

== Codified constitutions (most recent, in use today) ==
A codified constitution is a constitution that is contained in a single document, which is the single source of constitutional law in a state. An uncodified constitution is one that is not contained in a single document, but consists of several different sources, which may be written or unwritten.

=== Sovereign states (UN member and observer states) ===

=== Unrecognized and partially recognized countries ===
=== Dependent territories ===

== Uncodified constitutions ==
An uncodified constitution is one where not all elements are written into law. Typically some elements, such as constitutional conventions, are not written into law. Such elements are almost always written down somewhere (perhaps across multiple documents and/or publications), however written in documents that are not enforceable in law. Approximate dates have been listed below based on fundamental founding documents on governance of the respective countries.

* Constitution of Canada (1867, 1982)
* Basic Laws of Israel (1950)
* Constitution of New Zealand (1840, 1979–2016)

Created by writer Arnold Drake and artist Jim Steranko, the character first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #49 (October 1968). Lorna Dane belongs to the subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. She can control magnetism in a manner similar to her father Magneto. The character has been known as Polaris, Malice, and Pestilence at various points in her history. Dane has also been a member of the X-Men and the X-Factor.

The character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise. Lorna Dane made her live-action debut in &quot;The Gifted&quot; (2018), portrayed by Emma Dumont.

== Development ==

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Lorna Dane met the original team of X-Men while still a student. When the villain Mesmero used his &quot;psyche-generator&quot; to summon mutants in North America with latent powers, Lorna found herself compelled to travel to San Francisco, where Mesmero was. There she encountered the X-Man Iceman, who broke her trance by causing her to slip on a patch of ice and then convinced her to come to his apartment. At the apartment, Lorna met the rest of the X-Men who soon learned that she had latent mutant powers. Mesmero and his android Demi-Men captured her and took her to their desert headquarters, with the X-Men in pursuit. The psyche-generator awakened her mutant powers and Mesmero named her &quot;Queen of the Mutants&quot;.

When the X-Men attempted to rescue her, Magneto revealed himself as the leader of the group behind her abduction—and, more importantly, claimed to be Lorna&#x27;s father. Despite the X-Men&#x27;s assertions that Magneto is evil, Lorna could not bring herself to fight her own father. Iceman returns from meeting with her foster parents who told him that her birth parents had died in a plane crash years earlier. This information caused Lorna to turn against Magneto but it was later revealed that she had caused the accident and Magneto had her memories of it erased with the help of Mastermind. For a while, Iceman was attracted to her, but Lorna did not truly reciprocate his feelings. She instead fell in love with their teammate Havok.

Unbeknownst to Lorna, the Magneto who claimed to be her father is revealed to be an android. Shortly after, Lorna was captured by Sentinels, but was rescued by the X-Men. Lorna joined the X-Men and began living at Xavier&#x27;s mansion. Lorna aided Havok and the X-Men in repelling the alien Z&#x27;Nox&#x27;s attempted invasion of Earth.

Lorna Dane&#x27;s first &quot;code name&quot; was Magnetrix, but she quickly decided that she did not like this name. However, that did not keep Havok from continuing to use that name as a way to annoy and flirt with her. The two leave the X-Men to pursue their mutual interest in geophysics. They moved to the Diablo mountain range in California. 

Lorna, with Havok, is later seen battling the Hulk. When the old and new X-Men fought the mutant island Krakoa, Lorna displayed the full potential of her powers for the first time by disrupting the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, which sent Krakoa into deep space. They then joined Moira MacTaggert at her facility for genetic research on Muir Island.

===Mind controlled===
Lorna received a new costume of Shi&#x27;ar design, when her mind came under the domination of the Shi&#x27;ar Intelligence agent Davan Shakari, also known as Erik the Red. It was Erik the Red who gave Lorna the codename Polaris, which she has continued to use ever since. At the time, Shakari served D&#x27;Ken, then emperor of the Shi&#x27;ar Galaxy. Shakari kidnapped Alex Summers and Lorna, and subjected them to a powerful form of mind control. He turned them against the X-Men in an attempt to assassinate Professor Charles Xavier. A massive battle ensued at Kennedy International Airport, with the duo battling the X-Men. Polaris was defeated by Storm, but Shakari managed to escape with both her and Havok. Xavier eventually freed both Polaris and Havok from Shakari&#x27;s control.

Polaris and Havok remained inactive as members of the X-Men, though they did return from time to time to assist the team. With the X-Men, they battled Proteus on Muir Island. For the most part, Lorna and Alex remained in civilian life for a number of years, settling in New Mexico and completing their college degrees. They were forced to reluctantly help the X-Men in Arcade&#x27;s Murderworld. Their new life was interrupted when the Marauders ambushed them around the time of the Mutant Massacre. Polaris’ mind was overtaken by the psionic being known as Malice.

Under Malice&#x27;s control, Lorna attacked the X-Men as leader of the Marauders. Shortly thereafter, the Malice entity found that it had become permanently bonded to Lorna&#x27;s body. She led the Marauders against the X-Men during Inferno. After Mister Sinister was seemingly killed, Malice&#x27;s hold over Lorna weakened. Temporarily regaining control of her own mind, Lorna was able to place a phone call to the X-Men in Australia for help, but they arrived too late. Lorna had been taken to be with her alleged half-sister Zaladane, a priestess for the Savage Land&#x27;s Sun People. The X-Men arrived in time to witness Zaladane&#x27;s getaway, though Havok managed to infiltrate her army in disguise while the X-Men followed. In the Savage Land, the X-Men found that Zaladane had amassed an army of Savage Land natives who were being mentally controlled for her by Worm, one of the Savage Land Mutates. Zaladane revealed that she is in fact Lorna&#x27;s sister and, using the High Evolutionary&#x27;s machinery, stripped Lorna of her magnetic powers, taking them as her own. In addition, the process managed to finally separate Lorna from Malice. Zaladane and her forces clashed with Ka-Zar and the X-Men. During the encounter, Lorna&#x27;s secondary mutation activated: she grew in height, became invulnerable, and gained superhuman strength. Zaladane&#x27;s army was released from Worm&#x27;s control, and Lorna finally regained her freedom.

Having nowhere else to go, Lorna went to Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s mutant research station on Muir Island. On her way there, her secondary mutation activated again, as evidenced by a sudden increase in height. At this time, she discovered that her new mutation also affects those around her, amplifying negative emotions such as anger and hate.

===Muir Island===
Upon examination, Dr. MacTaggert was at a loss to explain Lorna&#x27;s new mutation, although she did confirm that the only way Zaladane could have taken her powers away was if she had been a biological sibling. Shortly after her arrival, Lorna joined the Muir Island X-Men team formed by Moira and former X-Man Banshee. This team defended Muir Island from the attacking Reavers, who were hunting for Wolverine.

Prior to this time, it had not been clear that Polaris was actually drawing strength from being a nexus for negative emotional energies. Polaris’ status as a nexus, however, was perceived by the villainous Shadow King. The Shadow King used Polaris as a gateway to allow him access to the physical world from the astral plane, causing a worldwide increase in anger, hatred, and violence in the process. Polaris was freed of his influence with the help of X-Factor and the X-Men during the Muir Island Saga. Upon the defeat of the Shadow King, Polaris’ magnetic powers return due to a combination of Zaladane&#x27;s death a short time before and the neural-disruptive psionic blade of the X-Man Psylocke, leaving no trace of her increased size, strength, or emotion-control powers.

===X-Factor===
Polaris was then asked to join the newly formed X-Factor by Valerie Cooper, and, tired of hiding out on Muir Island, she accepted. Havok and Polaris were set as its leaders. Although joining X-Factor offered Polaris the chance to reunite with Havok, their relationship remained largely unresolved. Polaris was able to come to terms with her experiences with mind control thanks to psychiatrist Dr. Leonard Samson, helping her to develop her confidence. Polaris developed a strong belief in Xavier&#x27;s dream while a member of X-Factor. Polaris became the government&#x27;s secret weapon against a possible attack from Magneto, with the government hiring the mercenary Random to test her abilities. Malice later returned to bother her once more but Havok and Polaris, out of their love for each other, each tried to absorb her, preventing the other from being possessed. In the end, Malice perished at the hands of Mister Sinister.

Shortly thereafter, Havok was kidnapped by agents of the Dark Beast, who forged a note explaining that Havok needed to get away from Polaris. This devastated Polaris, causing her to feel abandoned and betrayed. X-Factor&#x27;s atmosphere changed as the criminals Mystique and Sabretooth were forced by the government to join the group. Polaris began to question her place on the team after this, especially as most of her original teammates were no longer active. She discovered Havok&#x27;s fate as he attacked X-Factor with the Dark Beast&#x27;s agents, apparently under mind-control. After Havok was defeated, Polaris tried to reach out to him, only to be attacked and severely injured when she felt she could trust him. When Sabretooth betrayed and attacked the team, Polaris was severely injured.

After recovering from her injuries, and learning that Havok&#x27;s &quot;terrorist&quot; activities had been a front for his true undercover work, Polaris forgave him, although she rejected him romantically. She also agreed to join Havok&#x27;s new X-Factor team. However, during their first team meeting, she could only watch as Havok was seemingly killed in the explosion of a faulty time machine constructed by the mutant from the future, Greystone. Although Havok had left Polaris in charge of his team while trying to stop Greystone, she apparently did not feel like she could keep the team together, and they disbanded shortly thereafter.

===The Twelve===
Weeks later, Nightcrawler encountered Lorna in a church and she confided in him that she felt she was being followed and that she was sure Alex was still alive. A group of Skrulls working with Apocalypse were indeed shadowing her and broke into her apartment to retrieve the headgear from Havok&#x27;s original costume. Lorna then learned that she was one of , a team of mutants supposedly destined to usher in a new golden age for mutant-kind. Polaris journeyed with the X-Men to Egypt to battle Apocalypse. During the encounter, Magneto, another member of The Twelve, discovered that he could use Lorna to tap into the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field with incredible force, effectively hiding the reduced state of his powers at the time.

===Acolyte===
After Apocalypse was defeated, Polaris returned to Genosha with Magneto to supply him with power and help him keep order. She believed she was doing it for the greater good, but also enjoyed the education in her powers that she received. Magneto launched a full-scale assault on Carrion Cove, the last city opposing his rule, to gain access to technology that would restore his full abilities. Polaris attempted to stop him, but she was defeated and left the country with the Avengers. She later returned with Quicksilver to help oppose Magneto&#x27;s tyrannical rule.

Although Quicksilver was discovered and forced to leave Genosha, Polaris maintained a low profile to covertly transport refugees from the war to other nations, as well as monitor Magneto&#x27;s actions. After Magneto&#x27;s spine was severed by Wolverine, Polaris was able to steal a blood sample from his medical tests, which she used to confirm that Magneto was her biological father. When Cassandra Nova’s Sentinels destroyed Genosha and massacred millions, Polaris was one of the few survivors. She was left emotionally scarred after witnessing the massacre after being unable to save them.

===Trauma===
Later, some of the X-Men went to Genosha to survey what occurred there. They encountered a nude and deranged Polaris in Genosha after its population was massacred by Cassandra Nova&#x27;s Sentinels. When Polaris rejoined the X-Men, the extremely traumatic experience had left her with a darker, more ruthless personality, even killing some members of the anti-mutant Church of Humanity. Havok broke up with Polaris after they were about to be married, leaving her at the altar for nurse Annie Ghazikhanian with whom he had an affair while he was in a coma using telepathy. Polaris now driven to instability yet again went berserk and commenced to go on a rampage that nearly resulted in her killing Havok. A case was made that it was due to the trauma from Genosha but nobody bought it. Juggernaut succeeded in knocking her out. She remained this way until some psychic therapy with Professor Xavier. Polaris promised to do no more harm and she was accepted back to the X-Men.

Iceman later admitted to Polaris that he still had feelings for her and after some mild flirtation, the two began a relationship. The relationship was not to last, however, since Lorna&#x27;s other relationships (namely with Havok) were still unresolved. Havok has confessed to still loving her after Annie had left him, however, Polaris pushed him away.

===Decimation===
It was revealed that Polaris had lost her powers on M-Day, but had avoided telling her teammates. When confronted by Valerie Cooper, who has knowledge of her power loss, Polaris claimed that her power loss is psychological and she believes she is preventing herself from using them. Polaris eventually was forced by circumstance to accept that her powers were gone and admit the fact to the rest of the team—whereupon all the other members of her squad, except her would-be-paramours Iceman and Havok, revealed to her that they had already guessed it. She then left the mansion with Havok to &quot;search&quot; for her lost powers, irrationally convinced they lay with an alien named Daap, a seeming twin to the deceased X-Statix member Doop, who she had seen on a recent mission in space. Daap soon crashed to Earth and kidnapped Polaris and the Leper Queen, the leader of the anti-mutant group known as the Sapien League.

===Horseman of Apocalypse===
Apocalypse took them both, restrained the Leper Queen, and forcibly transformed Polaris into the new Pestilence. Seemingly mind-wiped, she ingested viruses from the World Health Organization and was attempting to create a meta-plague. In the climactic battle between the X-Men, the Avengers, and Apocalypse, Wolverine discovered a choking Pestilence was Lorna. She was recovering in the X-Mansion when former Horsemen of Apocalypse Gambit and Sunfire returned to take her away. She arose and refused to go with them, but also decided to quit the X-Men. Polaris decided to leave that night to search for Apocalypse in Egypt. She went alone and was later hunted until Havok and the new Uncanny X-Men team saved her. Emma Frost has also noted that her powers seem to be &quot;strange and mutating&quot;.

===The Rise and Fall of The Shi&#x27;ar Empire===
After being rescued from an anti-Apocalypse cult by the new team, Polaris agreed to join Professor X, Darwin, Havok, Marvel Girl, Nightcrawler, and Warpath on their mission to stop Vulcan. Her current relationship with Havok is still developing. Polaris seemed to finally show concrete signs of forgiving Havok, telling him to &quot;just shut up and kiss me&quot; after the team won their first battle against the entire regiment of Shi&#x27;ar soldiers in their beginning struggle against D&#x27;Ken and in support of Lilandra. Although Havok initially rebuffs her advances, hesitant to &quot;start up again after&quot; everything that happened between them, Lorna says that he needs to &quot;blow off some steam&quot; and the scene ends with them kissing. Polaris helps in the big fight and seriously hurts Vulcan and Gladiator with her powers, but in the end she is one of the X-Men left behind.

===Starjammers===
Following the death of Corsair at the hands of Vulcan, Polaris joined the newest incarnation of the Starjammers, intending to kill Vulcan and restore Lilandra Neramani to the Shi&#x27;ar throne. Their mission proved unsuccessful and Polaris, along with Havok, Ch&#x27;od, and Raza, was captured and incarcerated on an underwater planet by Vulcan.

===X-Men: Kingbreaker===
Lorna was later shown to still be a prisoner of Vulcan and his forces. Vulcan ordered her to be heavily drugged so they can further study this. She was later freed by Havok and the other Starjammers, who vowed to kill Vulcan.

===War of Kings===
Polaris and the Starjammers played a large role in the War of Kings storyline, which also featured Vulcan, The Inhumans, Nova, and The Guardians of the Galaxy. Pursued by a Shi&#x27;ar superdestroyer after escaping, Lorna uses the fact that she is Crystal&#x27;s sister-in-law to allow the Starjammers through the Kree&#x27;s defensive shield. After the Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard&#x27;s attack on Crystal and Ronan&#x27;s wedding, Lorna plays a minor but pivotal role in regaining Kree popular support for the Inhumans by making sure that Crystal&#x27;s humanitarian acts towards the injured Kree civilians are broadcast all over the Kree networks. After this, she once again joins the Starjammers on their mission to rescue Lilandra. They promptly commandeer a Shi&#x27;ar Ironclad (which she helps capture by magnetizing the Starjammer to its hull) which they then use to join the main Shi&#x27;ar fleet until their cover is blown when they rescue Rocket Raccoon and his team, the Guardians of the Galaxy. Following the surrender of the Shi&#x27;ar to the Inhumans, Lorna remains on the Shi&#x27;ar homeworld along with Havok and Marvel Girl.

===Realm of Kings===
Through Ch&#x27;od, and apparently due to the incident of Rachel and Korvus both losing the connection to the Phoenix Force, it is known that Polaris, Havok, Rachel and Korvus have departed for Earth.

===X-Men Legacy===
Magneto, Rogue, Frenzy, and Gambit respond to Rachel&#x27;s distress call and Rogue uses Legion&#x27;s powers to teleport to the space station they are on. Lorna, Korvus and Alex are mind controlled by an alien force and are being used to help torture and kill Shi&#x27;ar. When she meets up with Magneto their reunion is short lived as the Shi&#x27;ar attack the assembled group and Lorna, Alex and Korvus attack Magneto, Frenzy and Gambit. Rachel&#x27;s actions break them free of the mind control and the X-Men join forces. Polaris says she has many things she wanted to ask Magneto and he responds by saying at another time when they are out of danger. The team works together to build a black hole that takes the space station and all aboard back to Earth ending Lorna&#x27;s space arc.

===Regenesis===
Polaris along with Havok are seen joining Wolverine&#x27;s side after Wolverine suggests that they go out on their own away from their family and join X-Factor.

===Return to X-Factor===
During the Breaking Points storyline, Longshot used his psychometric powers to read a photograph of Lorna&#x27;s mother and nominal father from which Longshot learned the truth about their death. Lorna forced Longshot to show her what he had seen, using M&#x27;s telepathic powers to make a connection. Lorna was devastated to learn that the first outbreak of her powers led to their death in a plane crash. Magneto had Mastermind manipulate her memories to repress her involvement in her parents&#x27; death. Later, Polaris and Havok have broken up, due to Havok agreeing to lead the Uncanny Avengers, and Polaris wanting to remain with X-Factor.

===All New X-Factor===
Polaris is now the leader of X-Factor. The name was bought from Maddox by Serval&#x27;s CEO Harrison Snow. X-Factor is a corporate team that protects the interest of the company. It is revealed that Harrison secretly had nanos put in her right eye, without her consent. Her half brother Quicksilver is on the team and is secretly spying on her for her ex Havok.

===Secret Wars (2015)===
During the &quot;Last Days&quot; part of the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Polaris assisted Magneto during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. As the energies of the two planets inched closer to impact cascade and send chaos through the streets, Magneto and Polaris are taking the fight to this &quot;other&quot; Earth, battling the parallel Sentinels sent after them. Polaris is shocked to see the energy levels her father is exhibiting, all the while trying to protect the people caught in the crossfire of Magneto and the Sentinels.

===Secret Empire===
During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Polaris breaks in on a prison in New Tian when Havok is about to attack the time-displaced Jean Grey and Jimmy Hudson. While Jean and Jimmy look for their teammates, Polaris manages to defeat Havok and helps the young mutants to escape. Upon escaping, Polaris and Danger reveal to the team that Magneto assigned them to look after them, which they&#x27;ve done secretly.

===Dawn of X===
In the new status quo for mutants post &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;, Professor X and Magneto invite all mutants to live on Krakoa and welcome even former enemies into their fold. Polaris is seen with Magneto as he explains the process of resurrection for mutants involving the combined powers of The Five (Hope Summers, Goldballs, Proteus, Eva Bell and Elixir).

Polaris is seen attacking the last compound of Orchis on Earth with Magneto, Storm, and Cyclops. Later, she joins Rachel Summers, Daken, Northstar and former X-students Eye-Boy and Prodigy in a new initiative in Krakoa: they are to investigate any mutant death and prepare a report for The Five as part of the Resurrection Protocols of Krakoa. Their first case involves the supposed death of Northstar&#x27;s twin sister, Aurora. Following the conclusion of the &quot;X-Factor&quot; title, Polaris was elected during the Hellfire Gala to become a new member of the main X-Men team.

==Powers and abilities==

She had also been shown to fight off toxins and drugs quicker than normal.

Additionally, Lorna Dane possesses expertise in geophysics, and has earned a doctorate in that field.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
Alex Schlesinger of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; described Polaris as one of the &quot;X-Men&#x27;s most iconic mutants&quot; and as an &quot;iconic hero.&quot; Deirdre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called Polaris a &quot;role model&quot; and a &quot;truly heroic&quot; female character. Maite Molina of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; noted the popularity of Polaris among comic book fans, saying, &quot;She does not believe there is a point in one’s heroic journey where you have to establish yourself. Polaris has fought against the tension of her agency. She has lived a history where much was taken from her. Ultimately, she has endured. So, despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles and countless foes, Lorna has never faltered in her steadfast role as a member of the X-Men. This is why she is so beloved.&quot; Lukas Shayo of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called Polaris one of the best female X-Men characters, writing, &quot;Lorna Dane is a force to be reckoned with in the field, and she is remarkably creative with her powers.&quot;
=== Impact ===
Polaris was the winner of a popularity contest held by Marvel Comics in 2021, which served to determine who would be the final member of a new X-Men team that would debut during the Hellfire Gala storyline.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
An alternate version of Polaris appears in the Age of Apocalypse reality. She was one of the many prisoners in Sinister&#x27;s Breeding Pens, and a victim of the Dark Beast&#x27;s tests. She had been rendered nearly powerless because Rogue had absorbed her abilities and permanently retained half of her powers when the two had a fallout prior to Rogue being taken to the X-Men. Prelate Scott Summers frees her, but she cannot recognize him; she mistakes him for Magneto, whom she believes is her father.

===House of M===
An alternate version of Polaris appears in the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline. Magneto becomes romantically involved with Susanna Dane an American exchange student in Europe who is helping smuggle him from place to place. When Magneto finds out she is having a child he tells her to go home because what she is doing is likely to get her and her child killed. Lorna Dane grows up in California and watches Magneto declare war on the human governments as a child. Eventually Magneto reveals he is her father when he becomes ruler of Genosha. Polaris is shocked and storms off due to him never having been there for her. She eventually comes around as she is seen later when the new world order began, where mutants were the ruling class and with Magneto being their monarch. Lorna is still residing with him in his palace on Genosha with all his children. Polaris, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were considered royalty in this reality, and Lorna eventually develops a close relationship with her father.

Polaris is framed for killing dozens of people with her powers during a rescue mission, and imprisoned in the Triskelion of the Ultimates with mutant terrorist Magneto. After beating him at Chess after only 12 or so games, Magneto beats her into unconsciousness with a chair, and then uses her to goad Havok into rescuing her, so that he can escape the maximum-security cell by swapping places with Mystique. In the end, Polaris&#x27; name is cleared and she returns to the Academy of Tomorrow. She was killed in Ultimatum along with the rest of the Academy of Tomorrow except for Havok.

<text>Muan County () is a county in South Jeolla Province, South Korea. In 2005, Muan County became the capital of South Jeolla following the transfer of the provincial office from its previous location in Gwangju to the village of Namak in Muan. Muan International Airport was opened here and will eventually replace the airport in Gwangju (it already replaced Mokpo Airport).

== Modern history ==
On 1 January 1963, several villages (ri in Korean) were incorporated into Mokpo city and huge reorganization was made by the South Korean government. In 1979, Muan township was promoted to a township (eup of South Korea). In 1980, Illo was also promoted into a township.

On 29 December 2024, a Jeju Air Boeing 737–800 passenger aircraft operating as Flight 2216 overshot the runway at Muan International Airport and crashed into a barrier. Out of the 181 occupants, 179 people (all 175 passengers and 4 of 6 crew members) were confirmed to have been killed and at least two were injured in the worst aviation accident to have occurred on South Korean soil.

== Administrative divisions ==
Muan County administers three towns (&quot;eup&quot;) and six townships (&quot;myeon&quot;). 

Namak-ri, where the provincial government of South Jeolla is located, is in Samhyang-eup. 

== Location ==
Muan County is located on the western tip of the southwestern part of the Korean peninsula. It acts as the primary link between Sinan County with the rest of the Korean mainland. Numerous beaches are also found on Muan&#x27;s coast.

Muan borders Yeongsan River with Naju and Hampyeong to the north, Yeongam to the east, Mokpo to the south. These surroundings have influenced the industrial and cultural structure of Muan County.

== Enterprise city ==
Muan was designated an enterprise city by the South Korean government for the Honam region (Southwest). The South Korean government and China have agreed to develop an industrial complex in a joint venture. It was reported that the Chinese government officially promised to invest in and help establish the complex area, which includes the construction of a college and distribution warehouses among other things such as a Chinatown for expatriates.

== Mud ==
Muan includes a large area of mudlands. The western area of the Korean peninsula has a large amount of mud thanks to the Rias coast. However, many mudlands have been destroyed or reclaimed for expanding city areas or industrial complexes.

The mudlands of Muan were designated one of the wetlands of the Ramsar Convention.

In the Muan mudflats, tourists cannot enter the sea without permission to protect the mudflats. But tourists can see the road that opens like the &quot;Miracle of Moses&quot; to reveal its face when the tide falls twice a day.

== Festival ==
Muan is widely known for its White Lotus Festival () located in Illo-eup. The festival occurs in mid-August when the white lotus flowers bloom fully onsite at the Hoesan White Lotus Pond (). Tourists can walk into the huge lotuslands via the many bridges that crisscross the water. Visitors may also ride the &#x27;duck boats.&#x27;

== Products ==
Muan is known for several famous products characteristic of the area. They are largely farming goods from onions to lotus products. Muan puts out 16% of the national onion production making its production volume the largest in Korea.

Muan county officially reported to host farming cluster of sweet potato, onion and lotus plants. The powder of lotus plants is used for making noodles.

<text>Chatham Island ( ) (Moriori: , &#x27;Misty Sun&#x27;; ) is the largest island of the Chatham Islands group, in the south Pacific Ocean off the eastern coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is said to be &quot;halfway between the equator and the pole, and right on the International Date Line&quot;, although that point is 173 miles WSW of the island&#x27;s westernmost point. The island is called &quot;Rekohu&quot; (&quot;misty skies&quot;) in Moriori, and &quot;Wharekauri&quot; in Māori.

The island was named after the survey ship HMS &quot;Chatham&quot; which was the first European ship to locate the island in 1791. It covers an area of .
Chatham Island lies south-east of Cape Turnagain, the nearest point of mainland New Zealand to the island.

== Geography ==

The geography of the roughly T-shaped island is dominated by three features: two bays and a lagoon. More than half of the west coast of Chatham is taken up by the deep indentation of Petre Bay. The island&#x27;s main settlement of Waitangi is located in a small indentation in Petre Bay&#x27;s southern coast. Other significant settlements are Kaingaroa on the northeast promontory, and Owenga on the south side of Hanson Bay.

On the east coast is the even larger Hanson Bay, which stretches for the entire length of the island ().

Much of the area between the bays is taken up by the large Te Whanga Lagoon, which drains to the sea to the east, into the southern half of Hanson Bay. This lagoon covers about , and drains several small rivers that rise in the hills at the south end of the island. The next largest lakes are Rangitahi and Huro, respectively northeast and southwest of Te Whanga. The central and north part of Chatham Island are mostly flat, with altitudes ranging from a few metres on the northeast and centre to 50 m on the northwest, but with a few scattered hillocks. The south part is higher, generally sloping down towards north and west; about half of it is over 150 m above sea level. The south coast of the island is mostly cliffs 100 m high or more. The highest point of the island (299 m) lies close to its southernmost point.




==Climate==
Chatham Island has an oceanic climate (Koppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) characterised by a narrow temperature range and relatively frequent rainfall. Their isolated position far from any sizeable landmass renders the record high temperature for the main settlement (Waitangi) just . The climate is cool, wet and windy, with average high temperatures between in summer, and between in July (in the Southern Hemisphere winter). Snowfall is extremely rare, the fall recorded near sea level in July 2015 marking the first such reading for several decades. Under the Trewartha climate classification, Chatham Island has a humid subtropical climate (Cf) for the lack of cold weather during the winter and a daily mean temperature above for eight months or more.
== Flora and fauna ==
Chatham Island hosts the only known breeding population of the endemic and critically endangered magenta petrel or tāiko (&quot;Pterodroma magentae&quot;). The seabird was thought to be extinct until 1978, and had a population of under 200 in 2017.

==In popular culture==
Chatham Island (or &quot;Isle&quot;) is featured in the first and in the final chapter of &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, the 2004 novel by David Mitchell. The novel was adapted for screen in 2012.

<text>Epistemic minimalism is the epistemological thesis that mere true belief is sufficient for knowledge. That is, the &quot;meaning&quot; of &quot;Smith knows that it rained today&quot; is accurately and completely analyzed by these two conditions:

# Smith believes that it rained today.
# It is true that it rained today.

The thesis is called &quot;minimalist&quot; by way of contrast with the competing accounts, which more or less universally require that true belief is necessary but insufficient for knowledge—that is, that a belief needs to be true in order to count as knowledge, but that truth alone is not enough—that &quot;something else&quot; is needed. Traditionally, that something else was held to be evidential justification; today it is usually held to be either justification &quot;and also&quot; some other condition, or else some other condition &quot;instead of&quot; justification, which will avoid the Gettier problem.

Whatever the analysis, though, the standard view (both pre-Gettier and post-Gettier) pushes for &quot;narrower&quot; analyses of knowledge than mere true belief. Epistemic minimalism turns in exactly the opposite direction, and argues for a much more &quot;inclusive&quot; analysis--one which includes even Gettier cases, lucky guesses, and completely unjustified beliefs, as long as they happen to be true. The thesis is a &quot;minimalism&quot; in the sense that it eschews the additional requirements piled on top of true belief and argues that the intuitive reasons given for the justified true belief (JTB) analysis and its descendants are either misleading or misunderstood.

The most famous (or infamous) proponent of epistemic minimalism is Crispin Sartwell (1991). The view has been criticized by many epistemologists, with an influential criticism being delivered by William Lycan (1994).

<doc id="393905" wikidata="Q1187461" url="?curid=393905" title="Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)">
<text>The Battle of Tanagra was a land battle that took place in Boeotia in 457 BC between Athens and Sparta during the First Peloponnesian War. Tension between Athens and Sparta had built up due the rebuilding of Athens&#x27; walls and Spartan rejection of Athenian military assistance. The Athenians were led by Myronides and held a strength of 14,000. The Spartans were led by Nicomedes and had a total of 11,500 soldiers. While both the Athenians and Spartans suffered great losses, Sparta ultimately claimed victory in this battle.

==Background==

Prior to the breakout of this battle, in the Persian Wars, the Spartan-led Peloponnesian League won a hegemony. As time progressed the Peloponnesian League grew to fear the power of the Athenian Empire. Relations between the Peloponnesian League worsened due to a breakdown in diplomatic affronts and demands.

In 478 BC, wanting to deny any future Persian invasion a base from which to operate, Sparta had urged Athens, along with other Greek cities, to refrain from rebuilding their walls. However, suspecting a Spartan ploy and having already begun the work of construction, Athens employed subterfuge to delay the wheels of diplomacy until Athens could finish them. Athens did this by waiting to send Athenian politician Themistocles to Lacedaemon until Athens had started constructing the walls resulting in the Long Walls being nearly completed by the time Themistocles told Sparta that there were plans to rebuild the Long Walls.In 464 BC, suffering another Helot rebellion and failing to make progress in the siege against their stronghold Ithome, Sparta had asked for Athens&#x27; aid along with its other allies. A &quot;considerable force&quot; was sent out to support the Spartans at the urging of Cimon, who was appointed its commander. Sparta grew suspicious that the Athenians were potentially aiding the helots in Ithome in their uprising. Sparta turned away the Athenian forces that were sent to aid Sparta. These actions resulted in rising political tensions between Athens and Sparta. Athens was insulted and humiliated by Sparta’s actions, and this led to Athens breaking their alliance with Sparta.

In 458 BC, Athens began building the Long Walls, a defensive structure that secured the communication lines between the city and Piraeus. Like other walls that were built, it allowed the Athenians to refuse battle and retreat without fear of being cut from supplies coming from the sea.

==Battle==
When the Phocians made war on the cities of Doris—the traditional homeland of Doric Greeks—the Doric Sparta sent a relief force under the command of Nicomedes, son of Cleombrotus, acting as regent for his under-age nephew, King Pleistoanax. An army of 1,500 Spartan hoplites with 10,000 of their allies entered Boeotia and compelled the submission of Phocis.

Athens, already contemptuous of Spartan treatment and now suspecting Athens of negotiating with factions within the city to undermine democracy and prevent the construction of the Long Walls, maneuvered to cut off the Spartan army isolated in Boeotia.

The exiled Athenian politician and general Cimon met with the Athenian with his own forces known as the tribe known as the Oeneis to assist Athens. Cimon was turned away from assisting the Athenian forces due to the Council of 500 fearing it would disrupt Athens forces.

Facing either transport through waters controlled by the Athenian navy or a difficult march through the Geraneia mountain passes held by Athenian soldiers supported from Megara, the Spartans decided to wait either for the opening of a safe route home or an outright Athenian assault.

The battle was fought at Tanagra where the Athenian forces of 14,000 strong with their 1,000 allies from Argos met Sparta with 11,500 strong with 1,500 Spartans and 10,000 allied Hoplites. No details or accounts of the battle have been found. 

While no description of the events within the battle was given, both the Spartan and Athenian forces claimed both suffered great losses. Sparta claimed victory of this battle and were now able to return home through the mountain passes of the Isthmus, cutting down the fruit trees once crossing into the Megarid along the journey home.

==Aftermath==
Sixty two days after the battle, the Athenians regrouped under the command of Myronides. They then defeated Thebes at the Battle of Oenophyta and took control of Boeotia, taking down the wall the Spartans had built and taking one hundred of the richest men of the Opuntian Locris as hostages. With the victory, the Athenians also occupied Phocis, the original source of the conflict and the Opuntian Locris. Years after the Battle of Tanagra, Cimon was recalled from exile due to the special relations they had between Sparta and Athens. With these special relations, Cimon helped create a five year peace treaty between Athens and Sparta.

<text>Vostok (Russian: Восток, translated as &quot;East&quot;) was a family of rockets derived from the Soviet R-7 Semyorka ICBM and was designed for the human spaceflight programme. This family of rockets launched the first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) and the first crewed spacecraft (Vostok) in human history. It was a subset of the R-7 family of rockets.

On March 18, 1980, a Vostok-2M rocket exploded on its launch pad at Plesetsk during a fueling operation, killing 48 people. An investigation into a similarbut avoidedaccident revealed that the substitution of lead-based for tin-based solder in hydrogen peroxide filters allowed the breakdown of the H2O2, thus causing the resultant explosion.

== Variants ==
The major versions of the rocket were:

* Luna 8K72 – used to launch the early Luna spacecraft
* Vostok-L 8K72 – Variant of the Luna, used to launch prototype Vostok spacecraft
* Vostok-K 8K72K – a refined version of the above. This was the version actually used for human spaceflight
* Vostok-2 8A92 – used for launching Zenit reconnaissance satellites throughout the 1960s
* Vostok-2M 8A92M – modified version for launching Meteor weather satellites into higher orbits.
* Soyuz/Vostok 11A110 – hybrid of Soyuz and Vostok rockets used as an interim for two launches

<text>Yeonggwang County (&quot;Yeonggwang-gun&quot;) is a county in South Jeolla Province, South Korea.

==Speciality==
Yeonggwang is a large producer of a fish, the small yellow croaker which are sometimes given by Korean people as a gift to others. It is called &quot;Yeonggwang gulbi&quot; (meaning &quot;dried croaker&quot;) among Koreans, and it is nicknamed &quot;rice thief&quot; because of its wide popularity.

The fish originated from the Goryeo Dynasty. They migrate northward from the East China Sea, where they spend the winter season, to Yeonpyeongdo Island, to spawn at the start of the thawing season. They spawn at sea in front of Chilsan, near Beopseongpo in Yeonggwang, between April 10 and 30, while moving northward.

==Nuclear power plant==
The Hanbit Nuclear Power Plant was established in 1979 and has reached its full capacity. Now there are six plants. In 2007, plants of Yeonggwang achieved a position of third in the world, ranked by the degree of utilization.

<doc id="393917" wikidata="Q7636388" url="?curid=393917" title="Sullivan Act">
<text>The Sullivan Act was a gun control law in New York state that took effect in 1911. The NY state law requires licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Private possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, and carrying them in public is a felony. The law was the subject of controversy regarding both its selective enforcement and the licensing bribery schemes it enabled. The act was named for its primary legislative sponsor, state senator Timothy Sullivan, a Tammany Hall Democrat.

For handguns, the Sullivan Act qualifies as a &quot;may issue&quot; act, meaning the local police have discretion to issue a concealed carry license, as opposed to a &quot;shall issue&quot; act, in which state authorities &quot;must&quot; give a concealed handgun license to any person who satisfies specific criteria, often a background check and a safety class. According to a 2022 study, the law had no impact on overall homicide rates, reduced overall suicide rates, and caused large and sustained decrease in gun-related suicide rates.

The case &quot;New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen&quot; was decided in the U.S. Supreme Court, evaluating the constitutionality of this law on Second Amendment grounds. Arguments were held in November of 2021, with the majority of the court striking down the &quot;proper cause&quot; requirement of the current law on June 23, 2022, for violating both the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

==History==

Sullivan introduced the state-wide legislation &quot;partly in response to a marked increase in highly publicized violent street crime below Fourteenth Street&quot; (i.e. in the largely Italian immigrant Lower East Side) and was partially an anti-Italian reaction to perceived violent crime committed by Italian immigrants in New York City. Sullivan and other prominent New Yorkers were under public pressure to act, in the form of letters and recommendations from George Petit le Brun, who worked in the city&#x27;s coroner&#x27;s office, after a &quot;brazen early afternoon&quot; murder-suicide near Gramercy Park. The law went into effect on August 31, 1911.

The law also made it a felony to own or sell other items defined as so called &quot;dangerous weapons&quot;, including &quot;blackjacks, bludgeons, sandbags, sandclubs, billies, slungshots and metal knuckles.&quot;

According to Richard F. Welch, who wrote a 2009 biography of Sullivan, &quot;all the available evidence indicates that Tim&#x27;s fight to bring firearms under control sprang from heartfelt conviction.&quot; At the time, &quot;some complained that the law would only succeed in disarming lawful citizens, while others suspected that Sullivan was just trying to rein in the thugs on his own payroll.&quot; Lawman Bat Masterson, a friend of Sullivan&#x27;s, criticized the law as &quot;obnoxious&quot; and said that he questioned Sullivan&#x27;s mental state of mind over the law.

==New York City license holders==

In New York State, apart from New York City, the practices for the issuance of concealed carry licenses vary from county to county.

In New York City, the licensing authority is the police department, which rarely issues carry licenses to anyone except retired police officers, or those who can describe why the nature of their employment (for example, a diamond merchant who regularly carries gemstones, or a district attorney who regularly prosecutes dangerous criminals) requires carrying a concealed handgun. Critics of the law have alleged that New Yorkers with political influence, wealth, or celebrity appear to be issued licenses more liberally. The &quot;New York Post&quot;, the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, and other newspapers have periodically obtained the list of licensees through Freedom of Information Act requests and have published the names of individuals they consider to be wealthy, famous, or politically connected that have been issued carry licenses by the city police department.

Several NYPD license division officers and others were convicted in federal court for participating in a bribery scheme where they accepted bribes from at least 2012 through 2016 in exchange for hundreds of permits in instances where permits would not be approved. These officers conspired with &quot;expediting&quot; businesses and some created these businesses after retiring from the police force. 

==Litigation==

In the case &quot;Kachalsky v. Cacace&quot; (2012), a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the Sullivan Act, and rejected challengers&#x27; positions that New York state handgun law violates the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.

On April 26, 2021, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in &quot;New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen&quot;, seeking to examine whether the Sullivan Act and the may-issue policies, in general, violate the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. On June 23, 2022, the &quot;proper cause&quot; requirement of the Sullivan Act was struck down by the Supreme Court of the United States, leaving the general licensing requirement in place.

&quot;New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen&quot;, (Bruen), marked a significant point in second amendment cases. Prior to &quot;Bruen&quot;, the United States Supreme Court had not made a major development in second amendment cases since its decision in Columbia v. Heller in 2008 (Heller). As such, the Court&#x27;s decision had major effect on all fifty states. In &quot;Bruen&quot;, the majority set a new standard for evaluating the constitutionality of regulations that restrict Second Amendment freedoms. Specifically, the Court established that &quot;only if a firearm is consistent with the Nation&#x27;s &#x27;historic tradition&#x27; may a court conclude that the individuals conduct falls outside the Second Amendment&#x27;s &quot;unqualified command.&quot;

In supporting its opinion, the Court drew very strongly on its prior opinion in District of &quot;Heller&quot;. In &quot;Heller&quot;, the Court established that individuals have constitutional right provided for by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution to both &quot;keep and bear arms&quot; within the confines of their homes. As such, laws in which restricted or barred an individuals ability to keep said arms in their homes usually violate the Second Amendment. This included any statutory provisions that resulted in arms being rendered inoperable for the purposes of home defense such as requiring that such arms be &quot;disassembled or bound by a trigger lock.&quot;

The Court referenced its reluctance in &quot;Heller&quot; to rely on the balancing approach employed by lower courts, because its focus was on whether or not any restrictive regulations were &quot;analogous&quot; to those existent at the time that both the Second and fourteenth amendments were ratified. Moreover, the Court also had strong support for its reasoning based on their finding in &quot;Heller&quot; that the right to bear arms afforded by the Second Amendment is not diminished by the fact that the Second Amendment was established to ensure the creation of a future militia. Further drawing support from its decision in Heller, the Court noted that while gun owners can keep arms in their home, its not a place where they need to &quot;bear or carry&quot; guns. As such, it must be the Second Amendment&#x27;s intention to protect the right to bear or carry arms in the public to provide an avenue for self-defense.

The Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bruen&quot; continues to have ripple effects on cases based in the Second Amendment, including administratively. In Ms. Donna Y. Frazier the Office of the Attorney General of Louisiana held that a requirement for firearms ammunition be kept separate from the firearms themselves was unconstitutional pursuant to both the Second and the Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court applied the test established in Bruen requiring the government to &quot;affirmatively prove that its firearms regulation is part of the historical tradition that delimits the outer bounds of the right to keep and bear arms.&quot; In so doing, the court found that this law made essentially rendered a citizens ability to rely on self-defense &quot;impossible&quot;. Consequently, given that there was no adequate support provided via evidence or otherwise that would &quot;overcome the presumptive right&quot; established in &quot;Bruen&quot;.

In &quot;Range v. Attorney General United States of America&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit adopted the Bruen standard to justify allowing Range who would be considered a felon in most states to purchase a firearm. Specifically, Range pled guilty to the misdemeanor of making a false statement to obtain food stamps, which was punishable by up to five years incarceration. As such, Range was denied the ability to purchase a firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §922(g)(1) which makes it unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition. However, the court noted that post Bruen, the proper standard is no longer means-end scrutiny, but rather the focus on history and tradition. Consequently, the court held that the Government did not show that the historical tradition of firearms regulation supports depriving Range of his Second Amendment right to possess a firearm. As such, the court opened the door for individuals who would otherwise be barred from exercising their second amendment right as a result of the fact that their crimes may technically classified as felonies due to their punishable years, to exercise such rights.

==Controversy==

The first person convicted under the law was an Italian immigrant named Marino Rossi who was traveling to a job interview and carrying a revolver for fear of the Black Hand. At sentencing the judge, condemning Italian immigrants in general, declared: &quot;It is unfortunate that this is the custom with you and your kind, and that fact, combined with your irascible nature, furnishes much of the criminal business in this country.&quot; Prior to Marino&#x27;s arrest, others had been arrested under the new law but were released without charges. Whether this was part of the law&#x27;s intent, it was passed on a wave of anti-immigrant and anti-Italian rhetoric as a measure to disarm an alleged Italian and immigrant criminal element. The police department who granted the licenses could easily discriminate against &quot;undesirable&quot; elements. Days before the law took effect &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article saying &quot;Low-browed foreigners bargained for weapons of every description and gloated over their good fortune in hearing of the drop in the gun market before it was too late&quot;. After Rossi&#x27;s conviction &quot;The New York Times&quot; called this &quot;warning to the Italian community&quot; both &quot;timely and exemplary&quot;.

According to Peter Duffy of the New York Times, the Sullivan Law did not just affect second amendment laws in New York state, but it also became the blueprint for legislation that was later enacted throughout the united states. Moreover, Duffy noted that the bill itself received serious hostility from gun manufacturers, and that one state senator even noted that Sullivan&#x27;s bill &quot;won&#x27;t stop murders.&quot; An anonymous citizen also wrote to the New York Times and states that &quot;he objected to the automatic establishment of a presumption of felonious intent by the proposed law on the part of a citizen possessed of arms for home defense. Hence the unconstitutionality of the proposed law.&quot;

According to New York City historian George Lankevich, the Act was passed so that Sullivan could have friends in the police force plant handguns on his rivals and take them to jail. There were others who also tied the act to Sullivans ties with criminals so much so that they &quot;suggested that Big Tim pushed through his law so Tammany could keep their gangster allies under control.&quot;

<text>Kevin Sydney is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Werner Roth, the character first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #35 (Aug. 1967).

Sydney first appeared as Changeling, a mutant shapeshifter. He was a short-lived adversary for the X-Men who subsequently joined Professor X and died shortly after, making him the first member of the X-Men to die in action. The character was adapted as [[Morph (X-Men: The Animated Series)|Morph]] in the 1990s for &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;. An alternate reality version of the character under the codename Morph reappeared in the comics as part of the Exiles in 2001.

==Publication history==
The first run of appearances occurred in 1967–1968 when he appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #37–42 as Changeling. Although dying at the end of this run, he was thought to have been seen as a ghost in &quot;Excalibur: The Possession&quot; (1991) and returned as a zombie in &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; #34–35 (1991–1992).

The character was later reintroduced as an easygoing comic-relief character for &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;. According to showrunner Eric Lewald&#x27;s behind-the-scenes book, &quot;Previously on X-Men: The Making of an Animated Series&quot;, the creators (including writer Mark Edward Edens) had intended for Thunderbird to be the series&#x27; early sacrifice, but they became uncomfortable with the idea of killing off a Native American character. Scanning the X-books for a substitute, the character Changeling was found and repurposed for the series. Sydney&#x27;s codename was changed to Morph because DC Comics owned the trademark to &quot;Changeling&quot; when the series debuted.

Morph&#x27;s first comic book appearance was 1992&#x27;s &quot;X-Men Adventures&quot; #1, which adapted the &quot;Night of the Sentinels&quot; TV pilot. Then in 1995, inspired by the character in the animated series, a new Morph was featured in the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; crossover event, debuting in the one-shot comic &quot;X-Men Alpha&quot;. The character underwent a drastic change in appearance for this event, appearing white-skinned and hairless. Then in 2001, Marvel introduced an alternate-reality version of this Morph, from Earth-1081. He first appeared in &quot;Exiles&quot; #1.

==Fictional character biography==
===Earth-616 character===
Kevin Sydney, known as &quot;Changeling&quot;, originally worked for the villainous organization Factor Three. He acted as the Mutant Master&#x27;s second-in-command in an effort to trigger World War III. After successfully capturing the heroic X-Men, the Mutant Master is exposed as an extraterrestrial and goes out of control. The mutants of Factor Three ultimately joined with the X-Men to defeat the Mutant Master.

Following that group&#x27;s defeat, Changeling sought to reform. He divulged to Professor X that he was suffering from an unspecified terminal illness with only a few months left to live and wished to atone for his misdeeds. Professor X recruited Changeling to act as a stand-in, unbeknownst to the X-Men, while the Professor isolated himself to prepare a defense against the alien Z&#x27;Nox&#x27;s invasion. Changeling, masquerading as Professor X, led the X-Men&#x27;s efforts to defeat the Subterranean Grotesk. He was mortally wounded in battle with Grotesk by the explosion of an oscillotron machine and, consequently, died preventing the destruction of Earth. The X-Men mourned the loss of Professor X until it was later revealed that it was, in fact, Changeling.

When the mystical Darkhold was recreated, Changeling&#x27;s spirit used the opportunity to possess Meggan. Angry that he used his remaining time helping the X-Men instead of seeking a cure for himself, Changeling sought revenge against Professor X. However, Merlyn later admits that the encounter was merely fantasy, having orchestrated the event to prepare Excalibur.

Changeling is later raised from the dead as a zombie by Black Talon to form part of the team X-Humed (which also consisted of Harry Leland, Living Diamond, and Scaleface), and used to attack She-Hulk. He is able to break Talon&#x27;s control of him long enough to allow She-Hulk to win and lay the zombies back to rest.

===Earth-1081 character===
Morph is a hero from Earth-1081 who was a member of the New Mutants, X-Men, and Avengers. He was a unique son of loving parents. Early on in life, he managed to use his powers, and was able to give everyone what they wanted from him. Morph always used his power to joke around and keep everyone at ease with him, only comfortable to be himself around his parents.

His mother died of lung cancer and Morph tried in every way to cheer up his emotionally distraught father (often acting in a childish way whenever his father wanted him to act serious), who, unable to let his suffering go, chose to enroll his son in a boarding school; luckily, that school happened to be the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning.

Promoted to the X-Men, Morph&#x27;s sense of humor initially grated upon the much more serious team but eventually his humor and humility won them over. He was instrumental in many of the team&#x27;s victories and was chosen to be part of a pilot program with the Avengers, along with the Beast, as a public representative of mutant-kind.

Morph would return to the X-Men because, in his own words, &quot;he missed his freaky mutant brothers and sisters.&quot; On a subsequent mission, Morph and the rest of the X-Men were facing off against a threat known only as Stonehenge when Morph became unhinged from time.

====The Exiles====
After becoming unhinged from time, the mysterious Timebroker appeared to him, explaining that his unhinging was the result of a chain of events that caused his reality to change. In that new reality a wounded Morph is unable to maintain his form, and is in a coma, being only a white muddy substance in Beast&#x27;s lab. Hoping to save his own future, he becomes a member, and comic relief, of the Exiles, a group of universe-hopping heroes trying to save realities from ripples and alteration. Morph is a founding member of the Exiles and he is the only original member remaining throughout the series.

He soon befriended the mutant Sunfire, and her death left him emotionally wrecked.

====Mojo&#x27;s World====
The Exiles battled on, fixing reality after reality and struggling to keep it together. Following one of these missions the team was kidnapped by Mojo, the insane evil dictator of the Mojoverse. Mojo considered Morph the best entertainer he had ever seen and brought him back to entertain the masses. If he didn&#x27;t, Mojo would kill his fellow Exile, Nocturne. Eventually, Nocturne was able to escape and set Morph free. Mojo went crazy and threatened to kill Morph&#x27;s friends. An enraged Morph was on the verge of killing Mojo when the Timebroker stopped them. The Timebroker revealed Mojo had disrupted time but he was a necessary evil and could not be killed.

====Weapon X====
Morph continued to be the heart of the team until a mission in which Mimic was taken over by a Brood egg. During the battle, he killed Sunfire. Mimic was eventually cured but Morph was enraged. He was devastated by Sunfire&#x27;s death and told Mimic he should have killed himself rather than let something like this happen. Morph stormed off and threatened to leave the team. Magik, an unlikely ally, followed and tried to calm him. The two connected and despite her past attitude during missions, Morph realized Illyana was just a scared girl trying to get home. He remained angry with Mimic but helped his team fight against the rogue reality-hopping team, Weapon X.

Before the battle began, Magik attempted to switch sides, believing her team was weaker. Hyperion, the self-appointed leader of Weapon X, snapped her neck and Morph was driven into a rage. He attacked Hyperion, who attempted to blast Morph with his eyebeams, but Mimic saved him. During the brawl with Weapon X, Morph fought against an evil Ms. Marvel. Their battle caused a building to fall in on them, killing Ms. Marvel but Morph was able to survive.

The Exiles were triumphant and the Timebroker told Morph he could finally go home. His mission was fulfilled. Morph considered the offer but asked if he could stay with his team. He realized they needed him and he could not leave them behind. The Timebroker agreed; Morph asked him not to tell the rest of the Exiles of his decision. Morph and Mimic reconciled since he realized that Sunfire&#x27;s death was not Mimic&#x27;s fault and that the Brood was controlling him. The team moved on.

====Proteus====
Morph helped the team take down Proteus by impersonating the Maestro and weakening Proteus with a steel strip in his head. Morph went to take down Proteus but Proteus knocked the steel plate out of his head and took over Morph&#x27;s body in issue #80. When the Exiles tracked him to the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; world, cosmic entities &quot;O&quot; and &quot;K&quot; kidnapped him, saying his presence has tipped the balance of power. Using a tiara hooked to a brainwasher device, his teammate Blink managed if not to restore his consciousness, to brainwash Proteus, forcing him to act like Morph, and access to only Morph&#x27;s memories, functionally &quot;bringing him again to life.&quot; With Proteus trapped and believing he is Morph, he remained an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. Considering Morph&#x27;s body does not burn out like other hosts, Morph&#x27;s consciousness is still active beneath Proteus. Also, Proteus is immune to metal while in Morph&#x27;s body, since wearing a metal tiara during the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; world did not kill him. However, concerns about some discrepancies in &quot;Morph&#x27;s&quot; behavior forced his teammates to plan regular brainwashings with the same device, and, eventually, put him in stasis whenever his behavior would change again. However, that device was destroyed when Psylocke and Sabretooth fought so intensely that they shook the Crystal Palace, causing a bookcase to fall on Morph&#x27;s head, shattering the device. With the device shattered, it was only a matter of time before Proteus would re-emerge.

During a confrontation where Proteus reawakened, he found himself lacking in power to defeat the adversary. About to be crushed, Proteus shouted aloud his desire to stay alive. In a vision, he saw a figure, almost identical to his own true, energy form, telling him to take its hand, and he would survive. Upon doing so, Proteus found himself full of even greater power, using it to defeat his god-like enemy. Afterward, it was revealed that this being was the personality and soul of the true Morph, having been in limbo, gaining strength within Proteus and his own body, who had before only been able to speak a few sentences through Proteus&#x27; control. Revealing to Proteus that he had the ability to eject him from his body, Morph gave Proteus the chance to work together and share his body and their powers, in order to do more good, something which Morph had discovered Proteus desired deep within him. Proteus accepted, and the two now work together harmoniously, better than either could be alone.

However, soon after, when the New Exiles became immersed within the Crystal Palace, Proteus was absorbed in Morph&#x27;s place, freeing Morph once and for all.

==Powers and abilities==
Kevin Sydney is a mutant metamorph with the ability to alter his physical appearance and voice at will to resemble that of any person he chooses. His power could also transform the appearance of his costume as well, which was made of unstable molecules. Morph&#x27;s mutation to shape-shift has also made it so that his body is a Play-Doh-like substance and he can reattach limbs after they have been severed. He has limited telepathic abilities, which (in the original timeline) were enhanced by Professor X. As a side effect, he also gained limited telekinetic abilities. Upon choosing to work together and share his body with the energy mutant Proteus, Morph&#x27;s powers appear to be amplified, at least enough to defeat a self-proclaimed god. Whether the two have access to Proteus&#x27; reality changing abilities has yet to be determined.

He has also stated that his mutation gives him a high metabolism and makes him very hormonal. In &quot;Exiles&quot; #33 Sasquatch said she was never able to detect a scent on Morph and Sabretooth stated that while hunting Proteus in Morph&#x27;s body, Morph stands out like a sore thumb in a crowd of &quot;normal&quot; people to Sabretooth&#x27;s senses regardless of his form. It also appears he has the ability to fly as demonstrated in &quot;Exiles&quot; #27. Due to his shapeshifting ability he does not wear any actual clothing, and he takes joy in pointing this out.

Kevin Sydney is a skilled actor, and a highly trained and efficient organizer of subversive activities. He carried various advanced weaponry of alien Siri design belonging to Factor Three, including a ray gun carried in a holster at his side. Though Morph is a prankster who downplays his intelligence, he is deceptively smart. He has a Master&#x27;s degree in computer engineering, which he earned at Xavier&#x27;s Institute.

==Other versions==
Changeling is the character&#x27;s codename in the contiguous Marvel Universe, Earth-616. However, the character&#x27;s reinvention as Morph in the &quot;X-Men&quot; animated series raised his profile such that alternate versions of the character, now also named Morph, began to appear in stories set in other universes.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Morph was, like his &quot;regular Marvel Universe&quot; counterpart Changeling, an early recruit of the X-Men. Unlike Changeling, Kevin Sydney of AoA never died while impersonating Professor X, because in the Age of Apocalypse Xavier died before the X-Men were ever founded.

In the AoA timeline, Morph often agitated his teammates with his off-the-wall sense of humor and inappropriate timing; he describes himself as wanting to die with a smile on his face when his time comes. Despite his happy-go-lucky attitude, Morph has displayed signs of a softer, more empathetic side several times. For example, he morphed into Sabretooth in an effort to comfort Blink while she doubted her abilities, and he later gave Rogue the strength to endure against the horseman Holocaust by acting as her son. Shortly after the defeat of Apocalypse, he accompanied fellow X-Men Iceman, Wildchild and Exodus on an unspecified mission, during which they disappeared. Their fate has yet to be revealed, except for Wildchild, who has since joined a new team of Exiles.

===The Lost Generation===
A Morph is also seen as a member of First Line, set in Earth-616 but in the period after World War II.

===House of M===

In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, this reality&#x27;s Morph/Kevin Sydney is Kevin MacTaggert, as the son of Moira as a result of a mind-transfer between her son Proteus and Morph.

<text>Elizabeth Castor (; born May 11, 1941) is an American educator and former politician. Castor was elected to the Florida Senate and as Florida Education Commissioner, and she subsequently served as the President of the University of South Florida, and President of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.

Her public service included three terms in the Florida State Senate and one term as a Hillsborough County Commissioner. In 2004, she was the Democratic nominee for the open U.S. Senate seat of retiring Senator Bob Graham and was narrowly defeated by Mel Martinez.

After leaving elected politics, Castor was the director of the Patel Center for Global Solutions at the University of South Florida and later became chair of the J. William Fulbright Scholarship Board. She also works with Ruth&#x27;s List Florida, a group dedicated to recruiting and aiding qualified Democratic women candidates, receiving the Architect of Change Award from them in May 2018.

==Early life and education==
Castor was born and grew up in Glassboro, New Jersey, the daughter of Gladys F. (née Wright) and Joseph L. Bowe. Her father was the mayor of Glassboro.

She attended Glassboro State College, now Rowan University, where earning her bachelor&#x27;s degree. While at Glassboro, she was active in organizing a drive to support education in Uganda. President John F. Kennedy appointed her to a diplomatic mission to attend the independence celebrations in Kampala, Uganda, in 1962.

Following her graduation from Glassboro State in 1963, she attended Teachers College, Columbia University for a summer and then returned to Uganda, where she taught secondary school as part of the Teachers for East Africa program. While in East Africa, Castor participated in a project to help lead two dozen African school girls to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the first all-female expedition to accomplish this.

She returned to the U.S. in 1965, and settled in Miami-Dade County, Florida, where she was a teacher while studying for her Master of Education degree at the University of Miami, which she received in 1968.

==Career==
After receiving her Master&#x27;s degree from the University of Miami, Castor moved to Tampa, Florida, where she joined the League of Women Voters&#x27;s Tampa chapter, and became its president in 1970. Castor&#x27;s second daughter, Karen, was born in 1968 and her son, Frank, who currently serves as judge in Palm Beach County, Florida, in 1970. 

In 1972, she ran for the Hillsborough County Commission. Castor faced ten opponents in the Democratic Primary and a general election opponent. She won all the contests, becoming the first woman ever elected to the County Commission. During her term, she chaired the Environmental Protection Commission and became chair of the Board of County Commissioners in 1976. 

In 1976, she was elected to the State Senate and served until 1978, when she ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor. She was elected again to the Florida Senate in 1982 and became the president pro tempore of the Senate in 1985, the first woman to hold the post. Castor served on numerous education committees and became chair of the appropriations sub-committee on education. She was the co-sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment (1977) and championed bills to end discrimination and fund spouse abuse centers statewide. She successfully sponsored legislation providing for the early childhood education program.

In 1986, Castor was elected statewide to the Florida Cabinet as Florida Education Commissioner, the first woman ever elected to the state cabinet. As Commissioner of Education, Castor served on the Board of Regents and as a member of the Community College Coordination Board. She worked with the legislature to fund the first statewide program to provide funding for the early childhood education program. She worked also with the Insurance Commissioner to develop the Healthy Kids program, providing health insurance for low-income children enrolled in public schools.

===President of the University of South Florida===
In 1994, Castor became the first female president of the University of South Florida (USF), one of the largest universities in the southeast with an enrollment of over 40,000 students, four campuses, and a medical school. During her tenure, USF gained the Research I designation and the endowment tripled from US$65 million to just over US$200 million. The Honors Program was expanded dramatically and a major expansion of residential on-campus housing was approved. USF joined its sister institution, the University of Central Florida, in creating an academic and economic partnership, the I-4 High Technology Corridor. She pursued international exchanges with institutions in China, led a delegation of faculty and staff to the African Economic Summit in Harare, Zimbabwe, and encouraged new opportunities for USF faculty to study abroad.

===National Board for Professional Teaching Standards===
From 1999 to 2002, Castor served as president for the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The mission of the board is to build a system of high standards for education and encourage teachers throughout America to pursue its rigorous certification process. The number of board certified teachers grew under Castor&#x27;s leadership from about 2070 to 25,000 by 2003. Financial incentives were developed in 48 states and hundreds of school districts.

===2004 Senate campaign===

In the 2004 Senate campaign, Castor faced two Democratic candidates, Miami-Dade County, Florida mayor Alex Penelas, U.S. Congressman Peter Deutsch, and businessman Bernard Klein in the Democratic primary election.

Castor won the Democratic nomination on August 31, but lost the general election to Republican Mel Martinez on November 2, 2004, 49.5% to 48.4%. The overwhelming support for Martinez among Latinos effectively counterbalanced Castor&#x27;s relatively high popularity among swing voters throughout the state.

===Patel Center for Global Solutions===
In January 2007, Castor was appointed executive director of the Patel Center for Global Solutions at the University of South Florida. In June 2009, she resigned as executive director of the Patel Center, returning her focus back to education and politics.

==Personal life==
Castor married Donald Castor with whom she had three children: Kathy Castor, Karen Castor Dentel, and Frank Castor. Kathy Castor has been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives since 2007. Karen Castor Dentel is a former member of the Florida House of Representatives and current school board member of the Orange County Public Schools in Orlando, Florida since August of 2018. Frank Castor has served as a judge in Palm Beach County, Florida, since 2007. 

Betty and Donald Castor divorced in 1978. 

In 1989, Castor married Samuel P. Bell III, an attorney and lobbyist who had also served as a state legislator. He died in 2023, at the age of 83.

<text>The Voskhod (, &quot;Sunrise&quot;) was a spacecraft built by the Soviet Union&#x27;s space program for human spaceflight as part of the Voskhod programme. It was a development of and a follow-on to the Vostok spacecraft. Voskhod 1 was used for a three-man flight whereas Voskhod 2 had a crew of two. They consisted of a spherical descent module (diameter ), which housed the cosmonauts, and instruments, and a conical equipment module (mass , long, wide), which contained propellant and the engine system. Voskhod was superseded by the Soyuz spacecraft in 1967.

==Design==
The Voskhod spacecraft was, essentially, a Vostok spacecraft that had a backup solid fuel retrorocket added to the top of the descent module. The ejection seat was removed for more space and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90° angle to that of the Vostok crew position. There was no provision for crew escape in the event of a launch or landing emergency.

Lack of space meant that the three crew members of Voskhod 1 did not wear space suits. Both crew members wore spacesuits on the Voskhod 2 mission, as it involved an EVA and used an inflatable airlock. This allowed cosmonaut Alexei Leonov to exit and re-enter the craft. It was needed because the vehicle&#x27;s electrical and environmental systems were air-cooled, and complete capsule depressurization would lead to overheating. The airlock weighed , was in diameter, high when collapsed for launch. When extended in orbit, it was long, had an internal diameter of and an external diameter of . The second crew member wore a spacesuit as a precaution against accidental descent module depressurization. The airlock was jettisoned after use.

The lack of ejection seats meant that the Voskhod crew would return to Earth inside their spacecraft, unlike the Vostok cosmonauts who ejected and parachuted down separately. Because of this, a new landing system was developed, which added a small solid-fuel rocket to the parachute lines. It fired as the descent module neared touchdown, providing a softer landing.

A backup solid-fueled retrorocket was added to the top of the descent module in the event that the main retrorocket failed. This had not been necessary on Vostok as the orbit was low enough that the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit would decay in ten days if the retrorocket failed, there being enough onboard consumables to sustain the cosmonaut that long. In any case, the Blok E equipped R-7 booster lacked sufficient lift capacity for a backup retrorocket. Since Voskhod was well below the maximum lift capacity of the larger Blok I equipped R-7, it would be put into a quite high orbit and not decay in ten days.

Voskhod utilized the 11A57 booster, essentially the Molniya 8K78L with the Blok L stage removed to create a medium-lift LEO launcher, and later the launch vehicle for the Soyuz program.

The spacecraft lacked any launch escape system, meaning that the crew would not survive a booster failure that occurred in the first 2.5 minutes of launch (after payload shroud jettison, the descent module could be detached). Although work had begun on an LES in 1962, it was not ready yet and so the engineers and cosmonauts had to gamble that the booster functioned properly during ascent, as by 1964, the R-7&#x27;s success rate was improving but still not perfect.

Nations of early date ascended in the year 200. The Baekje Kingdom invaded and incorporated several small mahan states in the 13th year of King Onjo&#x27;s reign.
The Baekje Kingdom changed its name to Byeogol, but when is not clear.

In the Joseon period, Gimje first appeared in the year 1466 when Sejo of Joseon ruled. He promoted Gimje to an independent county. In 1628, Gwanghaegun of Joseon combined the nearby district of Mangyeong District into Gimje County.

Baekje was ruined by the Tang and Silla, and Unified Silla changed the city&#x27;s name to Gimje.

Goryeo promoted Gimje to Gimje District in the 21st year of King Injong&#x27;s reign.

The city government has always highly regarded and promoted the cultivation of rice and other crop species. From the Baekje Kingdom through the 21st century, Gimje has been one of the best areas for growing rice.

==Horizon Festival==
Gimje is known as the region where the sky meets the ground, hence the festival of horizon or &#x27;jipyeongseon.&#x27; It is held at Byeokgolje area, and more than one million tourists visit it each year. Gimje Horizon Festival hosts a wide range of programs including Samullori (traditional percussion quartet) contest, rural landscape drawing contest, celebratory performances, street parade, Ssireum (wrestling), and traditional weddings. Gimje is the only region where Koreans can see the horizon from a landlocked area. The festival was appointed an &quot;Excellent Festival&quot; for 4 years between 2004 and 2008. It also provides city residents a chance to experience traditional farming methods.

<doc id="393935" wikidata="Q2723601" url="?curid=393935" title="Mimic (comics)">
<text>Mimic (Calvin Montgomery Rankin) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was briefly a member of the X-Men in the 1960s, and was the first character to be added to the team after the original line-up and the first X-Man who was originally believed to not be a mutant, but Xavier later revealed that he had always known that Calvin was actually a mutant.

An alternate reality version of Mimic became a popular member of the Exiles, the reality-hopping team.

==Publication history==

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Werner Roth, he first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #19 (April 1966) as a villain.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
Calvin Rankin was born in Passaic, New Jersey. After an accidental mixup of chemicals from his father Ronald Rankin&#x27;s experiments, his latent mutation activated and he gained the ability to temporarily copy the skills, physical traits, knowledge, and superpowers of any person within close range (approximately ten feet), which led people to fear him. When Ronald found out about this, he retreated with Calvin into a mine where his father worked on a machine which, as he claimed, would make the abilities his son absorbed permanent. However, these experiments with the device caused several power outages in the vicinity; to hold off the mob which was tracking these disturbances, Ronald blasted the mine entrance, but was accidentally caught and killed in the explosion, and the device sealed deep inside the mine.

===With the X-Men===
Calvin first encountered the X-Men when he got into a fight with X-Men members Beast and Iceman in their civilian identities and duplicated their powers to defeat them. He later came across Marvel Girl, and found out her secret after gaining Marvel Girl&#x27;s telekinetic power. Rankin decided to seek out the X-Men in a plot to get to the machine and make their powers his permanently. Taking the costumed identity &quot;Mimic&quot;, he went to their mansion and battled the X-Men. He then escaped them, taking Marvel Girl hostage and drove to the mine, knowing the rest would follow. As the others came near, he regained their abilities, and he used Cyclops&#x27;s optic power to break through the rubble to the machine. The other X-Men freed Marvel Girl and battled Mimic. Initially, he gained the upper hand and activated the machine after using Professor X&#x27;s power to understand how the machine worked, but his powers were removed by Ronald&#x27;s device, as Professor Xavier had expected. Xavier then wiped his memory and let him go.

It was while attending the same college as Jean Grey that his memory returned. In another attempt to gain the X-Men&#x27;s abilities, Mimic set his sights on joining their ranks, becoming deputy leader in the process when he blackmailed his way into joining the X-Men. As a member of the team, he aided them against Banshee and the Ogre of Factor Three, but soon began to antagonize the other X-Men with his arrogant behavior and ended up expelled after a fight with Cyclops. However, shortly afterwards he saved his ex-teammates from the Super-Adaptoid, defeating the android by tricking it into trying to copy his artificial powers. This battle robbed him of his abilities, and he was left powerless but a better person.

===After the X-Men===
Eventually, Mimic regained his powers, but they were enhanced to also absorb people&#x27;s life forces, killing them. As the Beast tried to work out a solution, Calvin seemingly perished in a self-sacrificial fight against the Hulk after absorbing Hulk&#x27;s gamma radiation. For a long time, the X-Men believed him to be dead. In actuality, Mimic was in a coma which lasted for years. Mimic woke up when Wolverine came near him, because his power copied Wolverine&#x27;s healing ability. Mimic also ended up copying Wolverine&#x27;s other powers, including his claws, but after a confrontation with Wolverine, the Hulk (in his &quot;Joe Fixit&quot; persona) and an artificial intelligence remnant of his father, he began learning self-control by a meditation technique Wolverine taught him.

Mimic&#x27;s powers soon began to drain the life energy of those around him again. He fled to a remote Siberian village, where he soon encountered X-Force investigating a distress call. X-Force arrived to find a number of dead scientists and the enraged Mimic who illogically blamed X-Force for their deaths. During the fight, Mimic copied Sunspot&#x27;s powers, and their identical charge caused a large explosion, after which Mimic disappeared.

Mimic was later recruited by the entity Onslaught and his powers stabilized. Along with the Blob, he confronted X-Force member Warpath. But with the assistance of Risque, Warpath was able to subdue them. Soon after, Onslaught himself was defeated and imprisoned Mimic. Later, Excalibur tracked his telepathic signature and freed him, thinking that he was Professor Xavier. He was injured in this encounter and came to Muir Island to recover.

===Excalibur===
Mimic became friends with Excalibur. He helps confront the threat of the misguided Feron confronting the team with the Crazy Gang and the Technet. Mimic attends Captain Britain&#x27;s wedding.

Mimic later joined Mystique&#x27;s Brotherhood of Mutants and assisted in freeing the real Xavier. That group eventually disbanded, and Mimic was not among later groupings.

===Dark X-Men===
During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Mimic became a member of Norman Osborn&#x27;s Dark X-Men featured in Matt Fraction&#x27;s &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; stint where it was revealed that his unstable behavior was caused by his previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder which is now being treated with medication.

After Emma Frost and Namor defect to the X-Men taking Cloak and Dagger along with, Rankin continues as a member of Osborn&#x27;s X-Men alongside former Brotherhood member Mystique, Weapon Omega and Dark Beast as they try to capture Nate Grey during Osborn&#x27;s reign. Osborn forces Mimic to mimic the powers of Weapon Omega and forces the two to siphon Grey, succeeding in neutralizing Nate&#x27;s powers at least temporarily.

===Wolverine&#x27;s X-Men===
After Osborn was taken down by the Avengers following the Siege of Asgard, Mimic and Weapon Omega left H.A.M.M.E.R. where Weapon Omega&#x27;s powers started acting up. Mimic went to Hank McCoy, the only person who had always aided him when he needed, for help. Mimic took Weapon Omega to the Xavier Institute where Beast found out that Weapon Omega was about to explode. The X-Men tried various ways to prevent the explosion. But in the end, the only way left outside of death was an induced artificial coma. Weapon Omega asked his only friend to do it and Mimic complied. Borrowing Rachel Grey&#x27;s powers, Mimic put Weapon Omega to sleep promising to stay by the man&#x27;s side until waking up. After the ordeal, he asked Rogue if he could stay at the school to which Rogue agrees noting that he is going to be a wonderful teacher.

Following the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Mimic and Rogue were the only ones to respond to a prison riot at an unnamed prison. Although they were overpowered by the villains Griffin, Icemaster, Lightmaster, Quicksand, Ruby Thursday, Schizoid Man, Silk Fever and Supercharger, Rogue and Mimic were able to stop the riot by copying the powers of Armadillo, Equinox and Man-Bull.

===Extermination===
When the mutant-hunting Ahab comes from the future to try and kill the time-displaced original five X-Men, a younger version of Cable abducts the displaced team to send them home after killing his future self. He also captures Mimic so that he can amputate Mimic&#x27;s wings and transplant them to the younger Warren in place of his &#x27;new&#x27; cosmically-enhanced wings so as to preserve the timeline, but Mimic makes it clear that he knew what he was signing up for and agreed to the procedure. When Ahab tries to attack Cable&#x27;s base, Mimic sacrifices himself by posing as the young Cyclops, distracting Ahab long enough for the young X-Men to return to their home time after finding a way to stop Ahab.

==Powers and abilities==
Mimic has the mutant ability to copy the knowledge, skills, and powers (if any) of every individual within a certain range of him; different sources list this as anywhere from several feet to a mile radius. In his first appearances, he needed to get within about 5 feet to initially copy someone&#x27;s powers, but once he copied them he would retain the abilities so long as he was within several miles of them, even if he left that radius and then returned later. This was established shortly after he joined the X-Men, when Professor X had him fly in increasing circles using Angel&#x27;s wings and he flew beyond his copy range and the wings started to vanish, but they returned immediately when he turned back, but this has been retconned and changed several times. This applies to both superpowered and &quot;normal&quot; abilities, as shown when he duplicated Kitty Pryde&#x27;s ninja training. He has shown the capacity to manifest numerous powers at the same time, and since he also absorbs knowledge, he can immediately use copied powers with the same skill level as the original owner. However, he occasionally shows difficulty in juggling multiple powers, and his body can be overloaded by absorbing too many at once. Usually the Mimic loses his duplicated abilities once out of range of the owner, but due to the length of time spent with them, his body permanently retains the powers of the original five X-Men: Angel, The Beast, Cyclops, Iceman and Marvel Girl (the High Evolutionary&#x27;s temporary elimination of the mutant gene once erased these powers from the Mimic&#x27;s genetic template, but they appear to have returned since). Thus, he has the powers of flight (granted by angelic wings) of Angel, the increased strength and agility of Beast (complete with enlarged hands and feet), the optic blasts of Cyclops (because he lacks Cyclops&#x27; brain damage, Mimic is able to control them), the temperature manipulation of Iceman, and the telekinesis of Jean Grey. He partly retains Professor X&#x27;s telepathic powers, which once caused his telepathic signature to be mistaken for that of Charles Xavier, although he was not shown to be located during more recent searches for Xavier. He may also retain Wolverine&#x27;s recuperative abilities. 

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Mimic 78th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the Age of Apocalypse, Calvin Rankin was a prisoner and test subject of the time travelling Sugar Man who had travelled back from Earth-616 in order to create a plague. Rankin died because of the Sugar Man&#x27;s experiments. It is unknown if he had the copied powers of any mutants here.

===Civil War: House of M===
In &quot;House of M&quot;, Mimic is one of the government agents (alongside Nuke and Agent Barnes) sent to Genosha to kill Magneto and as many of his followers as possible. He and Nuke served as a distraction while Agent Barnes sneaked into Magneto&#x27;s headquarters. He then engaged Magneto in battle. But despite all the mutant powers he manipulated simultaneously, he was ultimately defeated when Magneto used an inhibitor collar to disable Mimic&#x27;s powers. The powers Mimic has copied are of Magneto&#x27;s and some unnamed Genoshans who possesses the abilities of hydrokinesis, flight (through reptilian wings), claws, optic blasts, cryokinesis, sharp fangs, pyrokinesis, and having multiple eyes.

===Exiles===

Mimic&#x27;s heroic counterpart from the parallel world Earth-12 is a founding member of the multiverse-traveling Exiles superhero team. This iteration has a clear mutant origin and his powers have a restriction: he can only copy a maximum of five mutant powers at a time. The copied abilities are about half as powerful as those of the original owners, and he is not able to copy knowledge or skill. For most of his appearances, he retains the powers of Wolverine, Colossus, Cyclops and Beast. He is originally depicted with the feathered wings of Angel, but gives those up in order to briefly copy the Dark Phoenix&#x27;s powers, and soon after mimics Northstar&#x27;s abilities.

In this reality, Calvin Rankin joined the Brotherhood of Mutants and was defeated by the X-Men. Abandoned by the Brotherhood, Mimic was imprisoned and was only freed by Professor X&#x27;s intervention, inviting him to join the X-Men. Mimic became a dedicated member. His abilities raised the team&#x27;s morale, as each member knew they were not alone in their powers, as Calvin could do exactly what they could. Calvin eventually rose to become leader of the team, and helped make his world one where mutants, along with other heroes, are respected and treated with a level of fame and celebrity. Much like Wolverine, who in Rankin&#x27;s reality is one of his closest friends, Rankin is fond of beer and music and has an unrequited love for Jean Grey. Rankin owns a chain of record stores and is a published author.

Although Rankin is accustomed to leading, he defers leadership to Blink on the grounds that she is from a reality that is more removed from the &#x27;mainstream&#x27; universe than the other Exiles, and will therefore be able to make the judgement calls that their missions require without being potentially compromised by her connection to the counterparts of their opponents. Rankin also begins a romantic relationship with Blink. The Exiles&#x27; missions grow increasingly dangerous, and Mimic is forced to kill more than once to safeguard entire realities. Many of those he slays are alternate versions of heroes he knows as allies in his home reality and their deaths weigh heavily on his mind, Mimic coming to increasingly resent how so many versions of the people he knows have been corrupted by their power. After an encounter with the sorcery of a vampiric Union Jack, Mimic is trapped for four years on an Earth overrun by the Brood. On this Earth, he is implanted with a Brood egg. He returns to his teammates incubating an egg only held at bay by his acquired healing factor. The Brood egg hatches during a moment of weakness, and the possessed Rankin is forced to attack his teammates, killing Mariko Yashida (Sunfire). Devastated by his actions, Mimic swears never to kill again. During an encounter with Weapon X, Mimic is forced to mimic Deadpool&#x27;s healing factor in order to survive. Unfortunately for Mimic, the healing factor also comes with Deadpool&#x27;s unique skin condition; the very sight of which instigated a conflict with Blink concerning their relationship. After swearing never to kill again, his subsequent hesitation to do so, further compounded by an illusion in which Blink claims to no longer love him, allows the villain Proteus to possess him when the Exiles visit the House of M version of the regular Marvel Universe. After Proteus leaves Mimic&#x27;s burnt husk of a corpse, the Exiles put his body into stasis. Blink later takes him back to his home reality for burial.

===The Big M===
Set on Earth-Earth-5423, another alternate Mimic called The Big M was his world&#x27;s greatest criminal and leader of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. With his team he slaughtered his reality&#x27;s X-Men and committed numerous other crimes — including mass murder — until he was finally captured by the Avengers and sent to a high security prison.

He encounters the Exiles Mimic when the latter enters his dimension. Using his telepathy, The Big M reads the Exiles Mimic&#x27;s mind and realizes that the only difference between the lives they led is that while one of them accepted Xavier&#x27;s offer of training and help, the other rejected it and sought a more destructive path. He reforms and reinvents the Brotherhood as his world&#x27;s X-Men. He retains the powers of Magneto, Professor X, Cannonball, Blink, and one unknown mutant.

===&quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot;===
In issue #6 of the &quot;X-Men: Evolution&quot; comic book, Mimic befriends Spyke but leaves the team due to his arrogance. His body apparently does not change in appearance when he copies powers, with the brief exception of taking on Nightcrawler&#x27;s skin coloration.

===Ultimate Marvel===
During the &quot;&quot; storyline, an Ultimate Marvel equivalent of Mimic is a prototype weapon who is being sold on the black market labeled as Super Soldier under Nick Fury. He was originally a soldier that served in Afghanistan who volunteered for the project, possibly due his admiration for Captain America. Shown to be transported by a terrorist cell in Bulgaria but intercepted, the collision activated his abilities while being released by the terrorists in the hopes of fighting the Ultimates. His powers go haywire while coming into contact with Scott Lang and is consoled by Giant-Man as Mimic died in front of the team.

===Marvel Noir===
In the &quot;Marvel Noir&quot; reality, an unpowered spy named Calvin Rankin/&quot;The Mimic&quot; is shown to be the target of Kurt Wagner and his agency Weapon X to broker a deal between Germany and its borders. Wagner freed him but later Rankin revealed himself as Weapon X, the target of the agency to replicate his skills of unmatched deception.

<text>PFLAG is an LGBT advocacy organization founded and led by friends and family of LGBT people. PFLAG is a national organization presiding over decentralized local and regional chapters. PFLAG has nearly 400 chapters across the United States, with more than 350,000 members and supporters.

&quot;PFLAG&quot; (pronounced ) was originally an acronym, standing for Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (later broadened to Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays). Until 1993, the name was hyphenated as P-FLAG. In 2014, the organization&#x27;s members voted to make PFLAG the group&#x27;s only official name and drop the phrase for which it previously stood, citing wider advocacy for groups beyond homosexual men and women.

==History==

The organization was founded by Jeanne Manford and her husband after their son, a gay man and gay rights activist, was beaten at a protest. On June 25, she participated with her son in the New York Pride March, carrying a hand-lettered sign that read &quot;Parents of Gays Unite in Support for Our Children&quot;. Manford soon founded the organization as &quot;a bridge between the gay community and the heterosexual community&quot;.

The first formal meeting of Parents of Gays (later PFLAG) took place on March 11, 1973, at the Metropolitan-Duane United Methodist Church in Greenwich Village (MDUMC – later the Church of the Village). Approximately 20 people attended. Rev. Ed Egan of MDUMC (1971–1977) was one of the founding members of &quot;Parents of Gays.&quot; Parents of Gays continued to meet monthly at MDUMC until at least 1984. 

The organization spread through regional chapters. In 1976, PFLAG LA had their first meeting of 30 parents. Following the 1979 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, representatives from these groups met for the first time in Washington, DC.

By 1980, PFLAG, then known as Parents FLAG, began to distribute information to educational institutions and communities of faith nationwide, establishing itself as a source of information for the general public. In 1981, members decided to launch a national organization. The first PFLAG office was established in Los Angeles under founding president Adele Starr.

In 1982, the Federation of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, Inc., then representing some 20 groups, was incorporated in California and granted nonprofit, tax-exempt status. In 1987, PFLAG relocated to Denver, under President Elinor Lewallen. During this time, PFLAG began advocating for lesbians and gay men in the military, where they were still formally banned under the Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell rules. PFLAG expanded to new communities in this time, including rural areas.

In 1990, following a period of significant growth, PFLAG employed an Executive Director, expanded its staff, and moved to Washington, DC. Also in 1990, PFLAG President Paulette Goodman sent a letter to Barbara Bush asking for Mrs. Bush&#x27;s support. Bush&#x27;s letter was inadvertently given to the Associated Press, leading to significant controversy for its perceived support of PFLAG.

PFLAG later expanded its advocacy to include bisexual and transgender people. In particular, in 1998, gender identity, including transgender people, was added to the mission of PFLAG after a vote at their annual meeting in San Francisco.
PFLAG was the first national LGBT organization to officially adopt a transgender-inclusive policy. In 2002, PFLAG&#x27;s Transgender Network, also known as TNET, became PFLAG&#x27;s first official &quot;Special Affiliate&quot;, recognized with the same privileges and responsibilities as regular chapters. In 2013, TNET was replaced by the Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Advisory Council.

In 2004, PFLAG/Chicago was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community.
In 2013, Jeanne Manford was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by then President Barack Obama.

In 2013, a bronze plaque was installed at The Church of the Village in Greenwich Village, memorializing the first meeting of PFLAG at the church. The plaque reads,In 1972, Queens schoolteacher Jeanne Manford walked alongside her gay son, activist Morty Manford, at the 1972 Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade, carrying a sign that read &#x27;Parents of Gays: Unite in Support of Our Children.&#x27; The overwhelming response to that simple act led Jeanne, her husband Jules, and early pioneers of the LGBT equality movement to create a support group for LGBT people, their parents, family, and friends. The first meeting of that group - now known as PFLAG - took place on this site in March 1973. Placed by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation &quot;in partnership with PFLAG members everywhere, in honor of the legacy of love that began here&quot;.In 2017, PFLAG celebrated the 45th anniversary of founder Jeanne Manford&#x27;s famous march with her son, gay-rights activist Morty Manford.

==Programs==
&quot;Straight for Equality&quot; is a national outreach and education project created by PFLAG National to empower new straight allies and trans allies who, unlike a more traditional PFLAG member, do not necessarily have a family or friend connection to the LGBTQ community. The Straight for Equality project was launched in 2007. This nationwide initiative expanded the organization&#x27;s efforts to include more people in the equality movement.

Since the 2007 launch, Straight for Equality in the Workplace has been PFLAG&#x27;s most successful initiative, with an array of workshops available to corporations in the US. In 2009, PFLAG launched Straight for Equality in Healthcare to educate and engage healthcare providers in all disciplines to be more culturally inclusive in their work. In 2012, PFLAG launched Straight for Equality in Faith Communities, which features faith-focused resources and tools for people of all denominations to start having critical conversations in their faith communities to create more welcoming institutions. And in 2014, PFLAG launched a new trans ally program through Straight for Equality.

Each year since 2009, PFLAG National has held the Straight for Equality Awards Gala, the only awards gala that exclusively celebrates the contributions of straight allies to the movement for LGBT equality. Past winners include civil rights pioneers like Maya Angelou and Johnnetta B. Cole; entertainer Liza Minnelli; actors Rosie Perez, Patrick Stewart, Martha Plimpton, and Sigourney Weaver; Broadway stars Audra McDonald and Will Swenson; sports icons Brendon Ayanbadejo, Scott Fujita, Chris Kluwe, and Hudson Taylor; authors Charlaine Harris and John Irving; faith leaders like Jay Bakker; and organizations including IBM, KPMG, MetLife, Sodexo, and Whirlpool.

&quot;Cultivating Respect: Safe Schools For All&quot; is PFLAG National&#x27;s umbrella program to support the efforts of educators, parents, and other trusted adults to make schools safe and inclusive.

&quot;Claim Your Rights&quot;, created in partnership with GLSEN, is a program to help parents, teachers, administrators and other trusted adults file complaints with the Office for Civil Rights at the US Department of Education on behalf of youth who have experienced school-based bullying, harassment, or discrimination.

&quot;PFLAG Connects&quot; was created in April 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of PFLAG&#x27;s local chapters moved their in-person support meetings to virtual meetings. PFLAG National also launched &quot;PFLAG Connects: Communities&quot; which are national support group meetings for a variety of BIPOC communities.

==Campaigns==

In the mid-1990s, &quot;Project Open Mind&quot; caused some controversy from Pat Robertson. He threatened to sue PFLAG and any television station that aired the project&#x27;s ads, which showed clips of anti-LGBT quotes from several people, including Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and United States Senator Jesse Helms. The ads can currently be seen on the Commercial Closet webpage.

==Advocacy work==
PFLAG National and the PFLAG chapter network engages in advocacy at the local, state and federal level and has issued public policy statements on a wide variety of issues. In the early 1990s, PFLAG chapters in Massachusetts helped pass the first Safe Schools legislation in the country. By the mid-1990s a PFLAG family was responsible for the Department of Education&#x27;s ruling that Title IX protects gay and lesbian students from harassment based on sexual orientation. When Pat Robertson threatened to sue any station that carried Project Open Mind advertisements, the resulting media coverage drew national attention to PFLAG&#x27;s message linking hate speech with hate crimes and LGBT teen suicide. PFLAG National campaigned to repeal &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; and in the fight for marriage equality in the United States—including filing an amicus brief with the United States Supreme Court. It continues working to end the practice of conversion therapy, to combat laws that permit discrimination under the guise of religious freedom such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and more.

==List of presidents==
==Outside the United States==
Similarly purposed (and sometimes similarly named) organizations have been established outside the United States since PFLAG&#x27;s 1973 establishment, although the majority of such organizations are unaffiliated with each other or with the PFLAG National in the U.S. (the founding organization). Inspired by PFLAG, one of the first group gathered 1974 in Switzerland (Elternkontakstelle, active from 1974 to 1984, a forunner of fels). Most recently, a PFLAG organization in People&#x27;s Republic of China, PFLAG China, was established in June 2008 by Wu Youjian in Guangzhou after she accepted her son&#x27;s homosexuality.

<text>Randy Glasbergen (February 20, 1957 – August 11, 2015) was an American cartoonist and humorous illustrator best known for three decades of newspaper syndication as well as a freelance career. He produced the syndicated strip &quot;The Better Half&quot; from 1982 to 2014.

Glasbergen&#x27;s work appeared in magazines, newspapers, greeting cards, calendars, social media, websites, textbooks, video screens and advertising worldwide. Thousands of Glasbergen&#x27;s cartoons and comic illustrations have been used by clients including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;China Daily&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, Microsoft, Dow Jones, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, Time Warner Cable, the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; &quot;Funny Times&quot;, American Greetings, Hallmark Cards, America Online, and many others around the globe. In addition to cartooning, Randy Glasbergen wrote text for hundreds of greeting cards for Hallmark Cards, American Greetings, and others.

== Biography ==
Glasbergen began his professional cartooning career at age 15. While still in high school, his cartoons were published regularly in many major magazines, including the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Kiplinger’s Changing Times&quot;, the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, Weight Watchers, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, and &quot;New Woman&quot;. After two semesters of journalism studies at Utica College of Syracuse University, he left school to pursue a full-time career as a freelance cartoonist in 1976.

Glasbergen&#x27;s comic panel &quot;The Better Half&quot; (originated by Bob Barnes in 1956) was syndicated by King Features Syndicate for 32 years, starting in 1982. From 1982 to 1992, Glasbergen did the strip under the pseudonym &quot;Jay Harris,&quot; so as not to confuse publishers who were familiar with his different style of humor and character design. (&quot;Harris&quot; was his wife&#x27;s maiden name.) At the end of syndication, &quot;The Better Half&quot; was appearing seven days a week in approximately 150 print and online newspapers around the world. With newspapers losing more and more readers to the Internet, Glasbergen retired &quot;The Better Half&quot; at the end of 2014 to devote more time and energy to his cartoon licensing operation, Glasbergen Cartoon Service.

His &quot;Glasbergen Cartoons&quot; feature was syndicated online by GoComics. Glasbergen&#x27;s &quot;Thin Lines&quot; health and fitness cartoons also appeared on GoComics as a weekly cartoon panel. Daily Glasbergen cartoons were found on his own website and sponsored editions of his cartoons appeared regularly on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media outlets.

== Personal life ==
Glasbergen lived in Sherburne, New York, a small rural town, with his wife and three basset hounds. He worked at home on the third floor of a very old house that once served as a boarding house for local school teachers.

He died on August 11, 2015, of cardiac arrest following admission to a hospital for an infection.

Glasbergen&#x27;s cartoons are still being used around the world in presentations, textbooks, newsletters and all forms of social media thanks to his family and their desire to continue his legacy.

== Bibliography ==
More than a dozen collections of Glasbergen&#x27;s cartoons were published in paperback and hardcover book form in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, and China. He was also the author of three bestselling North Light Books about the art and business of cartooning: &quot;Getting Started Drawing and Selling Cartoons&quot;, &quot;How To Be A Successful Cartoonist&quot;, and &quot;TOONS!&quot;

Glasbergen&#x27;s cartoon books have been published in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, and China. The following is a list of his cartoon books:
* &quot;Attack of the Zit Monster&quot; (Intervarsity Press)
* &quot;Technology Bytes&quot; (CCC Publications)
* &quot;Are We Dysfunctional Yet?&quot; (CCC Publications)
* &quot;Oh Baby!&quot; (CCC Publications)

<text>Fabrizio Moretti (born June 2, 1980) also known as Fab, is a Brazilian-American musician and visual artist best known as the drummer for American rock band The Strokes, with whom he has released six studio albums since 2001. A collaborative artist, he has been part of a series of groups since the mid-2000s, most notably the Brazilian-American band Little Joy, which released one album in 2008, and the experimental pop collective Machinegum, which he has led since 2018. Throughout his career, Moretti has worked on a variety of art projects which span the mediums of drawing, sculpture, and installation and performance art.

==Early life==
Moretti was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Stefano, an Italian nuclear engineer, and Ana Moretti, a Brazilian. He was raised with his older brother, Leo Moretti. Moretti and his family moved to New York City when he was three years old for his father&#x27;s career; they planned to live there for only three years, but ended up staying for seventeen before returning to Brazil. Speaking on identity during his young adulthood in New York, Moretti said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel like a Brazilian, I didn&#x27;t feel like an Italian, and I certainly didn&#x27;t feel like an American. So I was walking around trying to find my identity through New York City.&quot;

He began playing the drums at age five, playing in a soundproofed closet in his family&#x27;s Midtown Manhattan apartment, and became more serious during high school. As an adolescent, Moretti attended the Anglo American International School, which later merged with the Dwight School and is where he met fellow band members Nick Valensi and Julian Casablancas. Upon graduating high school, Moretti studied sculpture at SUNY New Paltz before dropping out to focus on his music career with The Strokes.

== Career ==

=== The Strokes ===

Moretti began drumming in an informal band with vocalist Casablancas and guitarist Valensi in high school, and continued after the two left Dwight. Later, Nikolai Fraiture joined as the bassist and the band was formed when guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. joined in fall 1998. Their first show as The Strokes was at the Spiral in New York City on September 14, 1999. The band released &quot;The Modern Age&quot; EP in 2001 under Rough Trade Records and was signed for a five-album record deal by RCA Records. The band released six LPs including &quot;Is This It&quot;, &quot;Room on Fire&quot;, &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot;, &quot;Angles&quot;, &quot;Comedown Machine and The New Abnormal&quot; with tours and festival sets in the North America, Europe, South America, East Asia and Australia. Following the completion of their album contract deal with RCA Records in 2013, the band has continued to release new music through Casablancas&#x27; Cult Records.

Moretti&#x27;s drumming style has been called crisp and clean, and having a mature elegance. He has said that he wants to provide a steady, driving force with his playing which resulted in him simplifying his drum kit to a four-piece set up with a hi-hat and ride cymbals. He commonly uses a Ludwig Classic Maple drum kit with Zildjian cymbals and Ahead sticks. Early on, he was known for drumming very hard, often breaking his drumsticks. Early records convey a more simplistic and &#x27;punk&#x27; style of playing and recording, while later records feature more compressed drums in the style of industrial and dance music.

===Little Joy===
In 2007, Moretti joined with Los Hermanos guitarist, singer, songwriter Rodrigo Amarante and Binki Shapiro to form the trio Little Joy, a Los Angeles-based Brazilian/American rock supergroup. Amarante and Moretti had met in 2006, at a festival in Lisbon where both their bands were performing, and the idea came up to start a new musical project unrelated to their respective bands. Little Joy was signed to Rough Trade Records label. Their debut album, produced by Noah Georgeson, was released in 2008.

=== Machinegum ===

Since 2018, Moretti has led the New York synth pop band and artist collective Machinegum (stylized machinegum) which both performs and records music and presents gallery installations. The group is composed of Moretti and Ian Devaney (vocalist of Nation of Language), Delicate Steve, Chris Egan, Martin Bonventre, and Erin Victoria Axtel. The group has also collaborated with architect Joseph Vescio and actor/director Justin Bartha in the past.

Machinegum released their debut album &quot;Conduit&quot; in December 2019. Released on Frenchkiss Records, the group later signed to the record label in February 2020.

=== Other projects ===
====Music====
Outside of his more traditional musical work, Moretti&#x27;s output often blends musical, performance, and visual art. He has frequently collaborated with musicians Devendra Banhart, Rodrigo Amarante, and New York City contemporaries including his Strokes bandmates. He has contributed songwriting and remixes to other artists and, throughout his career, has deejayed events.

Moretti was part of a project, Megapuss, with Devendra Banhart, Gregory Rogove and Noah Georgeson in 2008. The group released one album, &quot;Surfing&quot;. The following year, Moretti and Banhart collaborated on a project called Permanent Adventure. Moretti played drums for Neon Neon, on their track &quot;Dream Cars&quot;, from 2008&#x27;s &quot;Stainless Style&quot;. Moretti also played on Kesha&#x27;s 2012 song &quot;Only Wanna Dance With You&quot;, together with bandmate Julian Casablancas. He co-wrote &quot;Prisoner,&quot; from Har Mar Superstar&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Bye Bye 17&quot;, with Banhart and Amarante. Moretti and Amarante also were part of Banhart&#x27;s backing band during his 2013 tour which had dates in the US and Europe. Moretti also contributed to Amarante&#x27;s debut solo album in 2014.

In 2015, Moretti remixed Spoon&#x27;s 2014 track &quot;Inside Out&quot; for the band&#x27;s remix EP. In 2016, Moretti contributed an Eagles of Death Metal cover for the Play it Forward campaign, supporting aid for the victims of the 2015 Paris attacks; with Beck and Nick Valensi, he covered &quot;I Love You All the Time.&quot; Moretti sat-in as drummer for The 8G Band, the house band for Late Night with Seth Meyers, during the second weeks of April 2016 and January 2023. Moretti played drums on the 2017 track &quot;Indignities” by New York synth-pop band Nation Of Language; he also filled in as bassist on one of the band&#x27;s tours. In 2018, Moretti contributed the original instrumental song &quot;In Case of Separation&quot; to French conceptual artist Sophie Calle&#x27;s &quot;tribute&quot; album, &quot;Souris Calle&quot;.

In 2007, it was announced that Moretti was to executive produce a VH1 series called &quot;Clash of the Music Videos&quot; with then-girlfriend Drew Barrymore. However, the show was never produced.

====Art====
Moretti is an enthusiastic visual artist and enjoys sculpture and drawing. Since the mid-2000s, he has been contributing his work to various projects. This includes a 2013 art installation for Rag + Bone and showcasing his drawings in New York. He has also worked on artistic project FUZLAB with French cartoonist Luz in 2012; he continued to collaborate with Luz later in the decade, at one point sharing a studio with him in Paris. In 2017, a sculpture of his was included at a show in New York City&#x27;s Elizabeth Street Garden.

In December 2019, Moretti collaborated with Italian art dealer Fabrizio Moretti to present the exhibit &quot;Fabrizio Moretti x Fabrizio Moretti In Passing&quot; at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York City. The latter Moretti curated a collection of Old Master paintings and the former conceptualized the interactive exhibit.

In December 2021, Moretti designed and built, &quot;Kube,&quot; a nine-foot tall installation made of one-way mirror, polished steel and fluorescent lights. Inspired by the work of Yayoi Kusama and Bruce Nauman, &quot;Kube&quot; was crafted by hand in Brooklyn with the help of welder Franco V. and artist girlfriend Gabriella Corey, and was designed to showcase the viewer and the object together as one being repeated ad infinitum. Anish Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Mirror (Pagan Gold to Organic Green)&quot;, a disc of polished and highly reflective aluminium, is placed inside the Kube. In an interview with &quot;Flaunt Magazine&quot;, Moretti describes the experience from within the Kube, &quot;[t]he crux of this is that you become part of the art work when you’re in it, as you just experienced. When you’re inside, you can’t see out. It’s almost like the viewer becomes this nebulous being—but outside the box, you can be seen very clearly.” Speaking to the &quot;LA Times&quot; on the concept of the work, Moretti describes, &quot;[t]he mirror can be a source of vanity... But it can also be a point of self-reflection, you kind of see yourself outside yourself, one of many perhaps. And being able to see yourself and the relationship you have with the artwork kind of sanctifies that moment—I’m hoping.&quot;

==Personal life==
He was born in Brazil and has lived in the United States from a young age, having recently become a citizen of the United States in addition to holding citizenship with his father&#x27;s country of origin, Italy. Moretti speaks English, Portuguese, Italian and French.

From 2002 to 2007, Moretti was in a highly publicized relationship with actress Drew Barrymore. In 2007, he briefly dated actress Kirsten Dunst. He was later in a four-year relationship with Little Joy bandmate Binki Shapiro. From late 2011 to 2013, he dated actress Kristen Wiig. In August 2020, he started dating art historian Gabriella Corey. The two were engaged in 2023 and married in 2024. 

Moretti resides in New York City; he maintains an apartment near Union Square in the East Village, which he first bought in 2003. During the late 2010s, he lived in Paris for some time.

<text>Peter Russell Deutsch (born April 1, 1957) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Florida. Deutsch was a Democratic Representative from Florida&#x27;s 20th congressional district from 1993 until 2005.

== Background ==
Deutsch was born in the borough of the Bronx in New York City in 1957.

He graduated from the Horace Mann School in 1975 and attended Swarthmore College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1979. In college, he worked as an intern for the Senate Judiciary Committee. Deutsch graduated from Yale Law School with a Juris Doctor in 1982.

After graduating from Yale, Deutsch moved to Broward County, Florida, where he was a lawyer in private practice. He founded the nonprofit Medicare Information Program of Broward County, while working to help Medicare recipients in the area, and served as the group&#x27;s director during 1982.

In 1982, Deutsch was elected for the first of five two-year terms in the Florida House of Representatives, where he wrote legislation protecting seniors from illegal nursing home evictions.

In the 1992 House election Deutsch was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He was reelected in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002. Several times, including in 2000 and 2002, he ran for reelection unopposed. In the House he became the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which investigated amongst other things the Enron scandal, the Firestone Tire issue, NIH Conflicts and Martha Stewart’s ImClone stock trading case. Deutsch served from January 3, 1993, to January 3, 2005.

During the Florida election recount after the 2000 presidential election, Deutsch led many of the recount efforts in Broward County and brought the motion to the floor of the Senate to contest the results of the 2000 election, an effort that had been seconded by Alcee Hastings.

==U.S. Senate race, 2004==
In 2004, Deutsch declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat being vacated in 2005 by retiring Democratic Senator Bob Graham. Although Deutsch consistently led opinion polls in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area, and had the largest amount of cash on hand for most of the race, he lagged in statewide opinion polls behind rival Betty Castor, whose fundraising dramatically accelerated during the summer of 2004 with the help of EMILY&#x27;s List, which contributed close to $4.5 million in television and advertising dollars. The Castor campaign was accused of inappropriate coordination with EMILY&#x27;s List, and a lawsuit was filed with the Federal Election Commission.

In May 2004, Deutsch hired Roy Teicher, a former television writer, newspaper reporter and editor, as his communications director. In June 2004, he hired Sanford Dickert, CTO for the John Kerry for President Campaign, as his Director of Internet Strategy. In June, he came under heavy criticism from the Castor campaign after American Democracy Project, a 527 group run by Bernie Friedman, began attacking Castor&#x27;s handling of the Sami al-Arian incident. On March 2, 2006, Al-Arian entered a guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to help the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a &quot;specially designated terrorist&quot; organization. He was sentenced to 57 months in prison, and ordered deported following his prison term. Deutsch denied any involvement in the ADP efforts and denounced their tactics in public.

Later in the campaign, Senator Bob Graham and Florida’s other senator Bill Nelson proposed a pledge between Castor, Deutsch, and Alex Penelas to refrain from negative campaigning; Deutsch agreed to the pledge, but added a clause allowing him to raise &quot;legitimate&quot; electability issues. Deutsch released an ad questioning the veracity of Castor&#x27;s statements on the investigation and suspension of al-Arian.

Deutsch was defeated by Castor in the Democratic primary on August 31, winning only three counties (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Monroe). Castor went on to lose the Senate election to Republican nominee Mel Martinez. Deutsch was unable to run for reelection to the House because of his Senate campaign, and was succeeded by the new Democratic candidate, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

==Post-congressional career==
In the 2024 Presidential election, Deutsch endorsed former President and Republican Donald Trump. The announcement was made during a call by the Trump campaign marking the one year anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Deutsch said the former president&#x27;s stance on foreign affairs was the deciding issue for him, along with his stance on immigration and school choice.

==Personal life==
Deutsch currently resides in Ra&#x27;anana, Israel, with his family. However, he has not taken Israeli citizenship, does not speak Hebrew, and frequently visits Florida.
He also founded Ben Gamla Charter School in Hollywood, Florida. Deutsch and his wife Lori have two children, Jonathan and Danielle.

==Electoral history==

Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2000, write-ins received 187 votes.

**According to Florida law, no totals need be submitted when there is no opposition.

<text>The platinum-group metals (PGMs) are six noble, precious metallic elements clustered together in the periodic table. These elements are all transition metals in the d-block (groups 8, 9, and 10, periods 5 and 6).

The six platinum-group metals are ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum. They have similar physical and chemical properties, and tend to occur together in the same mineral deposits. However, they can be further subdivided into the &quot;iridium-group platinum-group elements&quot; (IPGEs: Os, Ir, Ru) and the &quot;palladium-group platinum-group elements&quot; (PPGEs: Rh, Pt, Pd) based on their behaviour in geological systems.

The three elements above the platinum group in the periodic table (iron, nickel and cobalt) are all ferromagnetic; these, together with the lanthanide element gadolinium (at temperatures below 20 °C), are the only known transition metals that display ferromagnetism near room temperature.

== History ==
Naturally occurring platinum and platinum-rich alloys were known by pre-Columbian Americans for many years. However, even though the metal was used by pre-Columbian peoples, the first European reference to platinum appears in 1557 in the writings of the Italian humanist Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484–1558) as a description of a mysterious metal found in Central American mines between Darién (Panama) and Mexico (&quot;up until now impossible to melt by any of the Spanish arts&quot;).

The name platinum is derived from the Spanish word &quot;platina&quot; (&quot;little silver&quot;), the name given to the metal by Spanish settlers in Colombia. They regarded platinum as an unwanted impurity in the silver they were mining.

By 1815, rhodium and palladium had been discovered by William Hyde Wollaston, and iridium and osmium by his close friend and collaborator Smithson Tennant.

== Properties and uses==


The platinum metals have many useful catalytic properties. They are highly resistant to wear and tarnish, making platinum, in particular, well suited for fine jewellery. Other distinctive properties include resistance to chemical attack, excellent high-temperature characteristics, high mechanical strength, good ductility, and stable electrical properties. Apart from their application in jewellery, platinum metals are also used in anticancer drugs, industries, dentistry, electronics, and vehicle exhaust catalysts (VECs). VECs contain solid platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh) and are installed in the exhaust system of vehicles to reduce harmful emissions, such as carbon monoxide (CO), by converting them into less harmful emissions.

==Occurrence== 
Generally, ultramafic and mafic igneous rocks have relatively high, and granites low, PGE trace content. Geochemically anomalous traces occur predominantly in chromian spinels and sulfides. Mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks host practically all primary PGM ore of the world. Mafic layered intrusions, including the Bushveld Complex, outweigh by far all other geological settings of platinum deposits. Other economically significant PGE deposits include mafic intrusions related to flood basalts, and ultramafic complexes of the Alaska, Urals type.

==PGM minerals==
Typical ores for PGMs contain ca. 10 g PGM/ton ore, thus the identity of the particular mineral is unknown.

===Platinum===
Platinum can occur as a native metal, but it can also occur in various different minerals and alloys. That said, Sperrylite (platinum arsenide, PtAs2) ore is by far the most significant source of this metal. A naturally occurring platinum-iridium alloy, platiniridium, is found in the mineral cooperite (platinum sulfide, PtS). Platinum in a native state, often accompanied by small amounts of other platinum metals, is found in alluvial and placer deposits in Colombia, Ontario, the Ural Mountains, and in certain western American states. Platinum is also produced commercially as a by-product of nickel ore processing. The huge quantities of nickel ore processed makes up for the fact that platinum makes up only two parts per million of the ore. South Africa, with vast platinum ore deposits in the Merensky Reef of the Bushveld complex, is the world&#x27;s largest producer of platinum, followed by Russia. Platinum and palladium are also mined commercially from the Stillwater igneous complex in Montana, USA. Leaders of primary platinum production are South Africa and Russia, followed by Canada, Zimbabwe and USA.

===Osmium===
Osmiridium is a naturally occurring alloy of iridium and osmium found in platinum-bearing river sands in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Trace amounts of osmium also exist in nickel-bearing ores found in the Sudbury, Ontario, region along with other platinum group metals. Even though the quantity of platinum metals found in these ores is small, the large volume of nickel ores processed makes commercial recovery possible.

===Iridium===
Metallic iridium is found with platinum and other platinum group metals in alluvial deposits. Naturally occurring iridium alloys include osmiridium and iridosmine, both of which are mixtures of iridium and osmium. It is recovered commercially as a by-product from nickel mining and processing.

===Ruthenium===
Ruthenium is generally found in ores with the other platinum group metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Small but commercially important quantities are also found in pentlandite extracted from Sudbury, Ontario, and in pyroxenite deposits in South Africa.

===Rhodium===
The industrial extraction of rhodium is complex, because it occurs in ores mixed with other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold. It is found in platinum ores and obtained free as a white inert metal which is very difficult to fuse. Principal sources of this element are located in South Africa, Zimbabwe, in the river sands of the Ural Mountains, North and South America, and also in the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury Basin region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of nickel ore processed makes rhodium recovery cost effective. However, the annual world production in 2003 of this element is only 7 or 8 tons and there are very few rhodium minerals.

===Palladium===
Palladium is preferentially hosted in sulphide minerals, primarily in pyrrhotite. Palladium is found as a free metal and alloyed with platinum and gold with platinum group metals in placer deposits of the Ural Mountains of Eurasia, Australia, Ethiopia, South and North America. However it is commercially produced from nickel-copper deposits found in South Africa and Ontario, Canada. The huge volume of nickel-copper ore processed makes this extraction profitable in spite of its low concentration in these ores.

== Production ==

The production of individual platinum group metals normally starts from residues of the production of other metals with a mixture of several of those metals. Purification typically starts with the anode residues of gold, copper, or nickel production. This results in a very energy intensive extraction process, which leads to environmental consequences. Carbon dioxide emissions are expected to rise as a result of increased demand for platinum metals and there is likely to be expanded mining activity in the Bushveld Igneous Complex because of this. Further research is needed to determine the environmental impacts. Classical purification methods exploit differences in chemical reactivity and solubility of several compounds of the metals under extraction. These approaches have yielded to new technologies that utilize solvent extraction.

Separation begins with dissolution of the sample. If &quot;aqua regia&quot; is used, the chloride complexes are produced. Depending on the details of the process, which are often trade secrets, the individual PGMs are obtained as the following compounds: the poorly soluble (NH4)2IrCl6 and (NH4)2PtCl6, PdCl2(NH3)2, the volatile OsO4 and RuO4, and [RhCl(NH3)5]Cl2.

===Production in nuclear reactors===

Significant quantities of the three light platinum group metals—ruthenium, rhodium and palladium—are formed as fission products in nuclear reactors. With escalating prices and increasing global demand, reactor-produced noble metals are emerging as an alternative source. Various reports are available on the possibility of recovering fission noble metals from spent nuclear fuel.

== Environmental concerns ==
It was previously thought that platinum group metals had very few negative attributes in comparison to their distinctive properties and their ability to reduce harmful emission from automobile exhausts. However, even with all the positives of platinum metal use, its possible future harm should be considered. Metallic Pt is considered not chemically reactive and non-allergenic, so that Pt emitted from VECs in metallic and oxide forms is considered relatively safe. However, Pt can solubilise in road dust, enter water sources, the ground, and increase dose rates in animals through bioaccumulation. These impacts from platinum groups were previously not considered, however over time the accumulation of platinum group metals in the environment may actually pose more of a risk than previously thought. As more internal combustion cars are driven, platinum metal emissions increase.

The bioaccumulation of Pt metals in animals can pose a health risk to both humans and biodiversity. Species whose food source is contaminated by these hazardous Pt metals emitted from VECs may accumulate them, as may the species that consume them, including humans.

Platinum metals extracted during the mining and smelting process can also cause environmental damage. In Zimbabwe, platinum-group mining caused pollution in water sources, acidic water drainage, and environmental degradation.

Another hazard of Pt is being exposed to halogenated Pt salts, which can cause allergic reactions leading to high rates of asthma and dermatitis. This response is sometimes seen in workers employed in production of industrial catalysts. Workers removed immediately from further contact with Pt salts showed no evidence of long-term effects, however continued exposure could lead to health effects.

Platinum use in drugs also may need to be reevaluated, as some of the side effects to these drugs include nausea, hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity. Handling of these drugs by medical personal also led to side effects including chromosome aberrations and hair loss. The long-term medical effects of platinum drug use and exposure await evaluation.

While exposure to relatively low volumes of platinum group metal emissions may not have long-term health effects, it is unknown how the accumulation of Pt metal emissions will affect the environment as well as human health, what levels of risk are safe, and how potential hazards from platinum-group metals can be mitigated.

<doc id="393945" wikidata="Q2888296" url="?curid=393945" title="Portuguese conquest of Ceuta">
<text>The Portuguese conquest of Ceuta took place on 21 August 1415, between Portuguese forces under the command of King John I of Portugal and the Marinid sultanate of Morocco at the city of Ceuta. The city&#x27;s defenses fell under Portuguese control after a carefully prepared attack, and the successful capture of the city marked the beginning of the Portuguese Empire. Ceuta was held under Portuguese control until being transferred to Spain in 1668.

==Background==
Ceuta is a north African coastal city strategically located on the Strait of Gibraltar. In 711, shortly after the Arab conquest of North Africa, the city was used as a departure point for the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. However, the city was destroyed in 740 and only rebuilt in the 9th century, passing to the Caliphate of Córdoba in the 10th century. In the subsequent centuries it was ruled by the Almoravids, the Almohads as well as various Andalusian Taifas. Ceuta then experienced a period of political instability, under competing interests from the Marinid Empire and the Kingdom of Granada. A Nasrid fleet sent by Abu Said Faraj, Governor of Málaga, conquered Ceuta from the &#x27;Azafids in May 1306; later, in 1309, the city was taken by the Marinids with the support of an Aragonese fleet.

The city featured rich trade with the Levant, Egypt, Libya, abundant tuna fishing stocks in its surrounding waters as well as coral, which constituted its main export industry, besides being also a notorious pirate haven, where Berber pirates sold their prey after raiding Iberian coasts and shipping. Ceuta&#x27;s position opposite the straits of Gibraltar gave it control of one of the main outlets of the trans-African Sudanese gold trade; and it could enable Portugal to flank its most dangerous rival, Castile. It was defended by a composite system of walls, built and added to by various Moroccan dynasties throughout the centuries, most recently the Marinids, and with a high number of gates which could prove difficult to defend. It included a strong citadel built by the Marinids.

Relations between the Muslim Marinids of Morocco and the Nasrids Granada in southern Iberia were strained after Abu Said Uthman III had attempted to capture Gibraltar in 1411, while Yusuf of Granada in turn instigated a revolt in Morocco as a response.

After defeating a Castillian army that had invaded Portugal in 1385 at the Battle of Aljubarrota, the recently crowned King John I of Portugal signed a peace treaty with Castille, in 1411.

Even before signing peace with its only neighbour, King John I cast an eye at gaining Ceuta and began preparations as early as 1409. The chief promoter of the Ceuta expedition was João Afonso, royal overseer of finance. The children of King John, prince-heir Duarte, prince Peter and Prince Henry (later nicknamed &#x27;the Navigator&#x27;) eagerly supported the project, as the prospect of taking Ceuta offered them an opportunity to win wealth and glory.

==Preparations for the conquest==
Preparations for the conquest of Ceuta, such as the gathering of materials and money started years beforehand and carried out slowly, though the objective was kept a secret. No taxes were raised because such a course of action demanded a gathering of Cortes and it would risk leaking the objective of the projected expedition. Nor was currency debased. Loans were taken, foreign ships chartered, galleys repaired and new ones built, until 30 had been assembled by the admiral of Portugal Carlos Pesanha, and expenses closely controlled.

Prince Henry, later surnamed &#x27;the Navigator&#x27; was tasked with organizing the recruitment of men in the provinces of Beira and Trás-os-Montes and assemble them in the city of Porto. Henry&#x27;s brother Peter was tasked with enlisting in the southern provinces of Extremadura, Alentejo and Algarve, with the gathering point at Lisbon. Prince-heir Duarte handled paperwork and judicial matters, though he fell into depression.

===Faux embassy to Sicily===
In order to scout the defenses of Ceuta beforehand, King John nominated the Prior of Crato Dom Álvaro Gonçalves Camelo as ambassador to the then regent and heir of the Kingdom of Sicily Blanche of Navarre. He was to take two galleys commanded by general-of-the-sea Afonso Furtado de Mendoça and officially propose to Blanche the marriage of Prince Peter, but stop at Ceuta to take in supplies. They stopped at Ceuta for four days, and measured the depth of the harbour. Having successfully reached Sicily and received a negative reply, as King John had anticipated, they headed back to Portugal, again stopping at Ceuta.

After returning to Portugal, at the royal Palace of Sintra Dom Álvaro drew for King John and the princes in private a map of Ceuta and its surrounding geography with sand and thread.

===Disclosure of the plan to the privy council===
Only after he was in possession of these precise informations about Ceuta did King John then disclose his intentions to capture Ceuta to his wife Queen Philippa of Lancaster. By occasion of a hunting trip in Montemor-o-Novo later, the king then disclosed the project to the Constable of Portugal, the renowned general Dom Nuno Álvares Pereira, who approved it in earnest.

Finally, the King disclosed the project to the highest members of the Court, at Torres Novas, to where he summoned the Queen, the princes, the Constable Dom Nuno Álvares Pereira, the royal chancellor João das Regras, the archbishop of Braga Dom Lourenço, the grandmaster of the Orders of Christ Dom Lopo Dias de Sousa, the grandmaster of the Portuguese order of Santiago Dom Fernando Afonso de Albuquerque, the grandmaster of Aviz Fernão Rodrigues de Sequeira, the prior of the Hospitallers Álvaro Gonçalves Camelo, the Marshal of Portugal Gonçalo Vasques Coutinho, lord Martim Afonso de Mello, and the royal ensign João Gomes da Silva. By order of the King, the Constable expressed his vote in favor of the expedition first, the council then voting unanimously in favour too.

===Faux embassy to Holland===
The secretive nature of the expeditions purpose caused numerous theories to rise among Portuguese society as to its true objective, some speculating the King meant to undertake a Crusade to the Levant, others to conquer the Kingdom of Sicily, still others (correctly) guessing Ceuta. By that point, rumours of the preparations being carried out in Portugal against a secret objective spread to many neighbouring realms and their rulers. The residents of Ibiza and Sicily made preparations to resist a possible Portuguese attack, in which they incurred considerable expense. Some French wrote to King Ferdinand of Aragon expressing their suspicion that the Portuguese were preparing to participate in the Hundred Years War alongside the English, in France.

King John II of Castile, King Ferdinand I of Aragon and the emir of Granada Yusuf III all sent embassies to the Portuguese Court enquiring on the purpose of King John&#x27;s preparations; the Castilian and Aragonese ambassadors were reassured that the purpose of the armada aimed neither Kingdom, but the ambassador of Granada was only given evasive answers.

In order to conceal the true objective of the expedition, John dispatched Fernão Fogaça as an ambassador to the Count of Holland William VI, with the official mission of publicly demanding from the Count a compensation over a number of abuses the Hollanders had supposedly carried out at sea against Portuguese mariners. The Count had in fact been informed by King John of the true purpose of this phony embassy beforehand, hence he entertained Fogaça with a public audience in which he offered such a rude reply that it might be understood as a declaration of war. As a result, rumour thus spread that King John was about to depart on an expedition to attack Holland.

===Final gathering in Lisbon===

In the Spring of 1415, plague broke out in Lisbon, forcing the Court to relocate to the nearby town of Sacavém. On July 10, 1415, Prince Henry called at Lisbon with a fleet of 7 galleys and 20 naus bearing a numerous corps of well-equipped men. Among them was Aires Gonçalves de Figueiredo, a 90 year old &quot;fidalgo&quot; at the command of a nau.

The Portuguese fleet probably numbered 59 galleys, 33 carracks or naus and 120 smaller vessels, bearing as many as 50,000 men, of which about 20,000 were combat personnel. It featured English, French and German mercenaries or soldiers of fortune. One German baron commanded 50 men of his household, while an Englishman by the name of Mondo commanded four ships.
The expedition included among its ranks some of the most important persons in Portugal at the time besides the king, such as prince-heir Duarte, prince Peter, prince Henry, the Count of Barcelos Dom Afonso de Cascais, the Constable of Portugal Dom Nuno Álvares Pereira and his nephew Dom Álvaro Pereira, the Grandmaster of the Order of Christ Dom Lopo Dias de Sousa, the prior of the Knights Hospitaller Dom Álvaro Gonçalves Camelo, the Admiral Carlos Pessanha, the Count of Viana Dom Diarte de Meneses, the General of the Sea Afonso Furtado de Mendonça, the first Duke of Braganza Dom Afonso, the Marshal of Portugal Gonçalo Vascques Countinho and the Royal Ensign João Gomes da Silva, among others. All of the main noble houses in Portugal participated in the expedition, with the notable exception of the Lima family.

Shortly before their departure, Queen Fillippa fell ill from the plague that was then affecting Lisbon. She moved from Lisbon to Sacavém and called her sons to her bedside so that she could give them her blessing. Philippa presented her three eldest sons with jewel-encrusted swords, which they would use in their impending knighthoods, and gave each a portion of the True Cross, &quot;enjoining them to preserve their faith and to fulfil the duties of their rank&quot;.

Though he had been reluctant to marry her, the king had grown quite fond of his wife, and it is said that he was &quot;so grieved by [her] mortal illness… that he could neither eat nor sleep&quot;. In her final hours, Philippa was said to be lucid and without pain. According to legend she was roused by a wind which blew strongly against the house and asked what wind it was, upon hearing it was the north wind, she claimed it quite beneficial for her son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s voyage to Africa, which she had coordinated. At her death she prayed with several priests and, &quot;without any toil or suffering, gave her soul into the hands of Him who created her, a smile appearing on her mouth as though she disdained the life of this world&quot;. The expedition was nearly called off, but King John decided to carry it through. A day of mourning was decreed, at the end of which Prince Henry commanded that all participants wear their best, the ships be decorated and trumpets be sounded with fanfare.

The grandmaster of the Order of Aviz was appointed to administer Portugal in the king&#x27;s absence on July 23, and that day King John embarked on the royal galley. Two days later, the entire fleet weighted anchor and departed from Lisbon, while the citizens and local inhabitants watched from the surrounding hills and beaches.

From Sacavém, the Aragonese spy Ruy Dias de Vega wrote a few days later to the King of Aragon Ferdinand I that the objective of the expedition was rumoured to be either Ceuta or Gibraltar.

==Itinerary of the Portuguese fleet==
From the mouth of the Tagus River, the Portuguese fleet sailed south along the south-western coast of Portugal and rounded the Cape St. Vincent on July 26, and that night anchored at Lagos.

===Lagos===

The king disembarked at Lagos the day after arriving to hear Sunday mass, at the cathedral of Lagos by the royal chaplain the Franciscan João de Xira, who on the occasion read to the royal family and commanders the Crusade bull issued by the Pope in favour of all who would participate in the attack against Ceuta.

===Faro===
On 30 July the fleet weighted anchor to Faro, and as the wind blew weak, the fleet remained by that city till August 7, when they got on their way again. By late afternoon the Portuguese sighted Cape Espartel and turned out to sea, that night entered the Strait of Gibraltar and anchored by the Castilian town of Tarifa. Many members of the expedition were at that point convinced the ultimate goal of the fleet was to attack Sicily.

===Tarifa===
The settlement was then governed by the Portuguese Martim Fernandes Porto-Carreiro, who offered the king supplies and lifestock as refreshments. Since the fleet was well provided, King John refused the gift, but Porto-Carreiro was so offended by such rejection that he had the animals slaughtered and abandoned on the beach. As a compensation for this spirited act, the King and the royal princes gifted Porto-Carreiro rich jewels and 1000 &quot;dobras&quot;.

===Algeciras===
From Tarifa, the fleet next anchored at Algeciras, then belonging to the Emirate of Granada, subject to the Marinids of Morocco. King John ordered the attack on Ceuta from Tarifa on August 12, but when they moved out strong currents and contrary winds blew the Portuguese carracks east almost as far as Málaga, while the oarships proceeded to Ceuta and anchored in its harbour.

==Attack on Ceuta==

After the Portuguese galleys were in the harbour, the Marinid governor of Ceuta Salah ben Salah evacuated many of the women and children to the surrounding lands and was reinforced by the tribal inhabitants of the region, voluntarily led by religious leaders. So many took up arms in the defense of Ceuta that the Portuguese would later claim no less than 100,000 had reinforced it. Ceuta received no aid whatsoever from the Sultan Abu Said Uthman III of Fez, either because the Marinid dynasty was too embroiled in internal disputes to be able to organize relief or because Salah ben Salah had been acting in an independent manner in recent years.

The first engagements between the Portuguese and the defenders of Ceuta then took place, with the Portuguese galleys being shot at from the walls, the vessel of the Admiral Carlos Pessanha being damaged the worst, as it was the closest to shore. Despite the separation of the fleet, Pessanha landed a detachment of men to skirmish with the Moroccans ashore.

Having gathered the armada in front of Ceuta on the 16th, King John determined to assault the city the following day, but heavy winds then scattered the Portuguese fleet once more, forcing the king to seek refuge in the bay of Algeciras with the oarships, while the carracks were blown further east.
Seeing the Portuguese fleet scatter and believing the attack would not longer take place, many of the undisciplined warriors and militias that had gathered in the city for its defense withdrew to their lands, while governor Salah ben Salah took the fatal decision of demobilizing the rest of the volunteers to prevent further conflict, leaving nothing but the usual garrison.

===Interlude===
From Algeciras, Prince Henry was instructed to bring back all the scattered carracks in tow of the galleys. Plague broke out among the fleet and ravaged the crews. King John then held a Council of war with his command while anchored off Punta Carnero, Spain, but he rejected the opinion of those who suggested calling off the attack. On the night of August 20 the Portuguese fleet set out again, and anchored in the harbour of Ceuta, with the landing scheduled for the following day.

Salah Ben Salah ordered that as many available men as possible be posted on the walls and as many lights and candles be lit to give the impression of readiness and of a large and well-garrisoned city, but although brilliant the effect proved null on the Portuguese.

===Assault of Ceuta===

On the morning of 21 August 1415, John I of Portugal gave out the orders for the landing of the troops and a general assault on the city. As the king boarded a longboat to be taken ashore however, he was wounded in a leg. Prince Henry was signalled to lead the troops ashore instead.

The first to land was Ruy Gonsalves, who encountered resistance upon landing at Playa San Amaro. Prince Henry was the first prince to land at the head of a squadron of men. He was followed by his brother, the prince-heir Edward, and at the head of about 300 men both succeeded in driving the Muslims defenders back to the &quot;Almedina&quot; gate, which was breached by the Portuguese before it could be securely shut.

The Moroccans managed to put up some resistance within the cramped urban environment just beyond the gate, encouraged by a very large Nubian or Sudanese who stood his ground hurling large stones. After he was slain by Vasco Martins de Albergaria however, the Muslims turned and fled, chased deeper into the city by prince Pedro, prince Henry and the Constable at the head of the Portuguese troops.

As the Portuguese poured into the city, Salah ben Salah descended from the high citadel to try and check the advance of the attackers in the narrow streets, so the residents could at least flee in time with their families and belongings. Disregarding the open gate through which Prince Henry had breached into the city, Vasco Fernandes de Ataíde attempted to open another gate at the head of a squadron of men, however they were repulsed and Ataíde mortally wounded.
Prince Henry left behind a detachment of men to secure the gate while they waited for rest of the army; it arrived shortly afterwards commanded by the King, prince Pedro and the Constable Nuno Álvares Pereira. King John would however take no further part in the fighting, and sat by the gate. During the urban fighting, rumour spread among the Portuguese troops that prince Henry had perished, as he could not be located. Upon being informed of the rumoured death of his son, king John is supposed to have replied that &quot;such is the end which soldiers must expect&quot;.

Salah ben Salah held the citadel of Ceuta till sundown, but seeing no way to resist the Portuguese, he fled the city with a number of his men, taking their families and all they could carry. Only in the following morning of 21 August did the Portuguese realize the citadel was deserted. Ceuta was entirely in Portuguese hands and fighting ceased. Most of Ceutas residents fled the city, though a considerable number was killed in the action, and a few women, children and elderly unable to flee or take up arms could still be found in their houses.

Álvaro Vaz de Almada, 1st Count of Avranches was first hoisted the flag of Lisbon (or of Saint Vicent) over the Ceuta castle per orders of the king. This symbol still stands today as the flag of Ceuta, but in which the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Portugal were added to the center.
John&#x27;s son Henry the Navigator distinguished himself in the battle, being wounded during the conquest.

==Aftermath==
On the 21st of August the Portuguese consecrated the main mosque into the city&#x27;s cathedral. The Portuguese later found in its minaret two bells, which had previously been plundered by pirates from a Portuguese church in Lagos. Ceuta was constituted into a diocese, and the English Franciscan confessor of late Queen Philippa, friar Aymar d&#x27;Aurillac was appointed first bishop of Ceuta. That night was spent in careful watchfulness, and the morning of 22 of August was stormy with rain and hail.

The looting of the city was immense, though still less profitable than king John had expected. The Count of Barcelos Dom Afonso plundered more than 600 columns of marble and alabaster from the palace of Salah ben Salah and other buildings, along with an entire vaulted roof built with elaborate gilt work from a town square, for his residence in Portugal.

King John dispatched envoys to various European Courts notifying them of the victory. Among them, King John invited King Ferdinand of Aragon to join him in conquering north African lands, which Ferdinand appreciated, but died shortly after receiving the message.

Against the wishes of a considerable number of his men, he ultimately decided to keep the city, in order to pursue further enterprises in the area.

Appointing a governor proved unexpectedly difficult however, as many high-ranking nobles such as the Constable Nuno Álvares Pereira, the Marshal Gonçalo Vasques Coutinho and the head of the royal bodyguard Dom Martim Afonso de Melo all turned down the proposal of the king, but the Count of Viana Dom Pedro de Meneses willingly volunteered for the dangerous position. The father of Dom Pedro had sided with Castile against King John during the 1383–1385 Civil War, which may explain why Dom Pedro so eagerly sought the distinction.

The king ordered nearly 3000 men to stay behind as a garrison. It included 300 squires of the royal household, 300 squires of the household of prince-heir Edward, 250 squires of the household of prince Peter, 300 squires of the household of prince Henry, 600 crossbowmen on foot and horse, an unrecorded number of squires from the cities of Évora and Beja plus a number of nobles with their followers. Many common foot-soldiers deeply resented the prospect of living in an isolated frontier city, surrounded by hostile Muslim powers eager to obtain revenge on Christians, and fearing certain death or captivity, begged to be taken back, bribed officials to sneak them back aboard the ships or feigned illnesses. Some willingly settled in the city as militia, such as craftsmen.
Others eagerly embraced the life of frontiersmen. Likely many were nobles and their vassals, seeking wealth and glory in service overseas, such as Rui de Sousa, who stayed behind with 40 retainers. Such nobles could have become a serious factor of internal destabilization and conflict after peace had been signed with Castile in 1411.

===Later history===

As soon as the Portuguese fleet returned home with most of the army, the residents of Ceuta who had sought refuge in the surrounding hills and orchards attempted to recover the city numerous times, however they were easily fought back by the garrison in almost daily skirmishes. Dom Pedro had the houses, towers, orchards and groves around the city pulled down and ditches filled up so as to clear the line of sight around the city, and prevent ambushes.

After the conquest of Ceuta, the &quot;Casa de Ceuta&quot; was established in Portugal, being a royal institution with clerks, treasurers, warehouse officials and factors and numerous offices in Lisbon, Porto, Santarém and elsewhere, in charge of overseeing the supply of the city.

In 1419, the Marinid Sultan of Morocco Abu Said Uthman III laid siege to Ceuta with the help of the Nasrid Emir of Granada Muhammad VIII in an attempt to recover it, however the Portuguese successfully repulsed the attack under the able command of Dom Pedro de Meneses. Blamed for losing Ceuta, the sultan was later assassinated when a coup took place in Fez in 1420, leaving only a child as his heir. Morocco descended into anarchic chaos, as rival pretenders vied for the throne and local governors carved out regional fiefs for themselves, selling their support to the highest bidder. The political crisis in Morocco released the pressure on Ceuta for the next few years.
In time, Ceuta became a formidable military base, and one of the main havens for Christian privateering in the western Mediterranean, and the main base from which Portuguese ships raided hostile Muslim shipping from Salé to Granada and Tunis, an activity which yielded the captain of Ceuta Dom Pedro de Meneses and King John I valuable profits. On the other hand, Christian navigation in the Strait of Gibraltar became safer. Portuguese raids caused the Moroccan shores to be abandoned by a considerable number of inhabitants, who fled inland, while foreign trade gradually faltered. Ceuta was sought by soldiers of fortune of various nationalities, such as Castilians, Aragonese, Flemings, Germans and even Poles looking to gain wealth and glory.

Prince Henry distinguished himself at Ceuta as a daring commander. Later, Henry V of England, Pope Martin V, Emperor Sigismund and King John II of Castile all offered Prince Henry the command of their armies upon hearing of his reputation; however, Henry turned down these offers.

Under King John&#x27;s son, Duarte, the stronghold of Ceuta rapidly became a drain on the Portuguese treasury. Trans-Sahara caravans journeyed instead to Tangier. It was soon realised that without the city of Tangier, possession of Ceuta was worthless.

After Edward succeeded king John on the throne of Portugal, in 1437 Henry and Ferdinand persuaded him to launch a new attack on the Marinid sultanate. The resulting attack on Tangier, led by Henry, was a debacle. In the resulting treaty, Henry handed his brother Ferdinand to the Moroccans as a hostage and promised to deliver Ceuta back to the Marinids in return for allowing the Portuguese army to depart unmolested.

Possession of Ceuta would indirectly lead to further Portuguese expansion. The main area of Portuguese expansion, at this time, was the coast of Morocco, where there was grain, cattle, sugar, and textiles, as well as fish, hides, wax, and honey.

Ceuta had to endure alone for 43 years, until the position of the city was consolidated with the taking of Ksar es-Seghir (1458), Arzila and Tangier (1471). The city was recognized as a Portuguese possession by the Treaty of Alcáçovas (1479) and by the Treaty of Tordesilhas (1494).

Ceuta was transferred to Spain under the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668 after the Restoration War.

<text>Jeongeup (; ), is a city in North Jeolla Province, South Korea. The city limits include Naejang-san National Park, a popular destination particularly in autumn due to its foliage. Jeongeup is on the Honam Expressway and Honam Line, with the Seohaean Expressway also within easy reach, providing links to Seoul and Mokpo.

==Demographics==
Jeongeup&#x27;s population is in decline, with an average of 56 people moving to the city every day but 91 leaving, with the birth and death rates being equal. The divorce rate currently runs at 50%.

==Geography==

The main hills in Jeongeup are Naejang-san National Park and Ibamsan, though there are also several smaller hills in the city. It is the east of the city which is more mountainous, the west being a plain around the Dongjin River. There are several streams in Jeongeup, most notably the Jeongeupcheon, a tributary of the Dongjin. This over went a makeover by the city council in December 2009.

==Attractions==
Jeongeup, like many cities in Korea, had a &quot;hyanggyo&quot;, or Confucian school, where people were trained in Confucian ways. This building is a tourist attraction today, but is not open to the public.

Jeongeup is known for a traditional song from the Baekje Kingdom era, known as Jeongeup-ga. The song tells the tale of the lamenting heart of a woman waiting for her peddler husband&#x27;s return.

Naejangsa Temple: first erected in 636, but most of its current buildings were built after the Japanese invasions of Korea in 1597 and the Korean War. On 31 October 2012, the temple was destroyed in a fire that broke out.

==Festivals==
A maple festival around Naejang-san is held annually. The maple leaves here are widely regarded as some of the most beautiful in the country. The festival was abolished in 2002 but was revived in 2007. This festival includes several events regarding the chrysanthemum love.

Additionally, a century ago, Jeongeup was the site of a revolution by the religious movement of Cheondoism. A lot of peasants joined the movement against the Japanese invaders. For this, Jeongeup holds an annual ceremony to commemorate the event.

==Notable people==
* Seung Hwan Oh, professional baseball player, Olympic gold medalist
* Song Dae-kwan, singer
* Yu Sung-yup, politician

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Jeongeup is twinned with:
* Jongno District, Seoul
* Sacheon, South Gyeongsang Province
* Sokcho, Gangwon
* Suseong District, Daegu
* Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China
* Narita, Chiba, Japan

==Climate==

<doc id="393953" wikidata="Q1785499" url="?curid=393953" title="Roscoe Mitchell">
<text>Roscoe Mitchell (born August 3, 1940) is an American composer, jazz instrumentalist, and educator, known for being &quot;a technically superb – if idiosyncratic – saxophonist&quot;. &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; described him as &quot;one of the key figures&quot; in avant-garde jazz; All About Jazz stated in 2004 that he had been &quot;at the forefront of modern music&quot; for more than 35 years. Critic Jon Pareles in &quot;The New York Times&quot; has mentioned that Mitchell &quot;qualifies as an iconoclast&quot;. In addition to his own work as a bandleader, Mitchell is known for cofounding the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM).

== History ==
=== Early life ===
Mitchell, who is African American, was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States. He also grew up in the Chicago area, where he played saxophone and clarinet at around age twelve. His family was always involved in music with many different styles playing in the house when he was a child as well as having a secular music background. His brother, Norman, in particular was the one who introduced Mitchell to jazz. While attending Englewood High School in Chicago, he furthered his study of the clarinet. In the 1950s, he joined the United States Army, during which time he was stationed in Heidelberg, Germany and played in military parades with fellow saxophonists Albert Ayler and Rubin Cooper, the latter of whom, Mitchell commented, &quot;took me under his wing and taught me a lot of stuff&quot;. He also studied under the first clarinetist of the Heidelberg Symphony while in Germany. Mitchell returned to the United States in the early 1960s, relocated to the Chicago area, and performed in a band with Wilson Junior College undergraduates Malachi Favors (bass), Joseph Jarman, Henry Threadgill, and Anthony Braxton (all saxophonists). Mitchell also studied with Muhal Richard Abrams and played in his band, the Muhal Richard Abrams&#x27; Experimental Band, starting in 1961.

=== AACM and the Art Ensemble of Chicago ===
In 1965, Mitchell was one of the first members of the non-profit organization Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), along with Jodie Christian (piano), Steve McCall (drums), and Phil Cohran (composer). The following year Mitchell, Lester Bowie (trumpet), Kalaparusha Maurice McIntyre (tenor saxophone), Favors, Lester Lashley (trombone), and Alvin Fielder (drums), recorded their first studio album, &quot;Sound&quot;. The album was &quot;a departure from the more extroverted work of the New York-based free jazz players&quot;, due in part to the band recording with &quot;unorthodox devices&quot; such as toys and bicycle horns.

From 1967, Mitchell, Bowie, Favors and, on occasion, Jarman performed as the Roscoe Mitchell Art Ensemble, then the Art Ensemble, and finally in 1969 were billed as the Art Ensemble of Chicago. The group included Phillip Wilson on drums for short span before he joined Paul Butterfield&#x27;s band. The group lived and performed in Europe from 1969 to 1971, though they arrived without any percussionist after Wilson left. To fill the void, Mitchell commented that they &quot;evolved into doing percussion ourselves&quot;. The band did eventually get a percussionist, Don Moye, who Mitchell had played with before and was living in Europe at that time. For performances, the band often wore brilliant costumes and painted their faces. The Art Ensemble of Chicago have been described as becoming &quot;possibly the most highly acclaimed jazz band&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s.

=== Creative Arts Collective and beyond ===

Mitchell and the others returned to the States in 1971. After having been back in Chicago for three years, Mitchell then established the Creative Arts Collective (CAC) in 1974 that had a similar musical aesthetic to the AACM. The group was based in East Lansing, Michigan and frequently performed in auditoriums at Michigan State University. Mitchell also formed the Sound Ensemble in the early 1970s, an &quot;outgrowth of the CAC&quot; in his words, that consisted mainly of Mitchell, Hugh Ragin, Jaribu Shahid, Tani Tabbal, and Spencer Barefield.

In the 1990s, Mitchell started to experiment in classical music with such composers/artists such as Pauline Oliveros, Thomas Buckner, and Borah Bergman, the latter two of which formed a trio with Mitchell called Trio Space. Buckner was also part of another group with Mitchell and Gerald Oshita called &quot;Space&quot; in the late 1990s. He then conceived the Note Factory in 1992 with various old and new collaborators as another evolution of the Sound Ensemble.

He lived in the area of Madison, Wisconsin and performed with a re-assembled Art Ensemble of Chicago. In 1999, the band was hit hard with the death of Bowie, but Mitchell fought off the urge to recast his position in the group, stating simply &quot;You can&#x27;t do that&quot; in an interview with Allaboutjazz.com editor-in-chief Fred Jung. The band continued on despite the loss.

Mitchell has made a point of working with younger musicians in various ensembles and combinations, many of whom were not yet born when the first Art Ensemble recordings were made. Mainly from Chicago, these players include trumpeter Corey Wilkes, bassist Karl E. H. Seigfried, and drummer Isaiah Spencer.

In 2007, Mitchell was named Darius Milhaud Chair of Composition at Mills College in Oakland, California, where he currently lives. Mitchell was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in March 2012 in Minehead, England.

=== Teaching ===
Mitchell has taught at the University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and the California Institute of the Arts. From 2007 to 2019 Mitchell has taught at Mills College in Oakland, California. Among his notable students is David Sulzer.

<doc id="393959" wikidata="Q574598" url="?curid=393959" title="Anti–Corn Law League">
<text>The Anti–Corn Law League was a successful political movement in Great Britain aimed at the abolition of the unpopular Corn Laws, which protected landowners’ interests by levying taxes on imported wheat, thus raising the price of bread at a time when factory-owners were trying to cut wages. The League was a middle-class nationwide organisation that held many well-attended rallies on the premise that a crusade was needed to convince parliament to repeal the corn laws. Its long-term goals included the removal of feudal privileges, which it denounced as impeding progress, lowering economic well-being, and restricting freedom.

The League played little role in the final act in 1846, when Sir Robert Peel led the successful battle for repeal. However, its experience provided a model that was widely adopted in Britain and other democratic nations to demonstrate the organisation of a political pressure group with the popular base.

==Corn Laws==

The Corn Laws were taxes on imported grain introduced in 1815. The laws indeed did raise food prices and became the focus of opposition from urban groups who had less political power than rural Britain. The corn laws initially prohibited foreign corn completely from being imported at below 80s a quarter, a process replaced by a sliding scale in 1828. Such import duties still made it expensive for anyone to import grain from other countries, even when food supplies were short. The League was responsible for turning public and elite opinion against the laws. It was a large, nationwide middle-class moral crusade with a utopian vision. Its leading advocate Richard Cobden, according to historian Asa Briggs, promised that repeal would settle four great problems simultaneously:
* First, it would guarantee the prosperity of the manufacturer by affording him outlets for his products. 
* Second, it would relieve the &#x27;condition of England question&#x27; by cheapening the price of food and ensuring more regular employment.
* Third, it would make English agriculture more efficient by stimulating demand for its products in urban and industrial areas.
* Fourth, it would introduce through mutually advantageous international trade a new era of international fellowship and peace. The only barrier to these four beneficent solutions was the ignorant self-interest of the landlords, the &#x27;bread-taxing oligarchy, unprincipled, unfeeling, rapacious and plundering.&#x27;

==The League==
The first Anti–Corn Law Association was set up in London in 1836; but it was not until 1838 that the nationwide League, combining all such local associations, was founded, with Richard Cobden and John Bright among its leaders. Cobden was the chief strategist; Bright was its great orator. A representative activist was Thomas Perronet Thompson, who specialized in the grass-roots mobilisation of opinion through pamphlets, newspaper articles, correspondence, speeches, and endless local planning meetings. The League was based in Manchester and had support from numerous industrialists, especially in the textile industry.

The League borrowed many of the tactics first developed by British abolitionists, while also attempting to replicate its mantle of moral reform. Among these were the use of emotionally charged meetings and closely argued tracts: nine million were distributed by a staff of 800 in 1843 alone. The League also used its financial strength and campaign resources to defeat protectionists at by-elections by enfranchising League supporters through giving them a 40-shilling freehold: the strategy certainly alarmed the Tories. One of the most nationally visible efforts came in the 1843 election in Salisbury. Its candidate was defeated, and it was unable to convince voters regarding free trade. The political parties in the 1830s targeted bigger cities for more support on &#x27;free trade&#x27;. However, the League did learn lessons that helped to transform its political tactics. It learned to concentrate on elections where there was a good expectation of victory.

Nevertheless, the League had a restricted capability for contesting electoral seats, and its role in the final act of 1846 was largely that of creating a favourable climate of opinion. 1845 saw Lord John Russell, the Whig leader, declare for complete repeal of the corn duty as the only way to satisfy the League; while the Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, had also been privately won over by Cobden&#x27;s reasoning to the league&#x27;s way of thinking. When the crunch came, Peel put through a (staggered) repeal through Parliament without a general election, to the applause of Cobden and Bright.

The League then prepared to dissolve itself. The Tory victory of 1852 saw preparations to revive the League, however, in order to keep a watching brief on Protectionist forces; and it was only after Disraeli’s 1852 budget that Cobden felt able to write to George Wilson: “The Budget has finally closed the controversy with Protection... The League may be dissolved when you like”. Many of its members thereafter continued their political activism in the Liberal Party, with the goal of establishing a fully free-trade economy.

W. H. Chaloner argues that the repeal in 1846 marked a major turning point, making free trade the national policy into the 20th century, and demonstrating the power of &quot;Manchester-school&quot; industrial interests over protectionist agricultural interests. He says repeal stabilized wheat prices in the 1850s and 1860s; however other technical developments caused the fall of wheat prices from 1870 to 1894.

==Model for other lobbying organisations==

The League marked the emergence of the first powerful national lobbying group into politics, one with a centralized office, consistency of purpose, rich funding, very strong local and national organization, and single-minded dedicated leaders. It elected men to Parliament. Many of its procedures were innovative, while others were borrowed from the anti-slavery movement. It became the model for later reform movements.}}

The model of the League led to the formation of the Lancashire Public School Association to campaign for free, locally financed and controlled secular education in Lancashire. It later became the National Public-School Association. It had little success because national secular education was a divisive issue even among the radical groups. However, it did help convert the Liberal Party from its laissez-faire philosophy to that of a more interventionist character.

Historian A. C. Howe argues:

==Critics==
* Thomas Carlyle declined invitations to lend support for the league, despite his opposition to the Corn Laws. He wrote to Thomas Ballantyne in January 1840: &quot;the abrogation of the Corn-Laws seems to be the cause of the Middle Classes and manufacturing Capitalists still &quot;more&quot; than it is that of the Lower Classes,—whose wretched social situation, however it might be alleviated for a few years, could in no wise, as I think, be &quot;cured&quot; thereby, nor even, without other provisoes, be put more decisively on the way towards cure&quot;.
* R. S. Surtees satirized the league in his 1845 novel, Hillingdon Hall. His cockney protagonist refers to “the ‘umbuggery of its ways...strong symptoms of utilitarian self-interest”; while a roguish actor is shown being couched as a paid lecturer for the League: “you have nothing to do but repeat the same old story over and over again…. Whatever is wrong, lay it to the corn tax. If a man can’t pay his Christmas bills, attribute it to the bread tax”.

<doc id="393968" wikidata="Q1585142" url="?curid=393968" title="Hardline (subculture)">
<text>Hardline is a subculture that has its roots in the vegan straight edge hardcore punk scene. It is commonly seen as a more extreme version of straight edge, with influences from deep ecology philosophy. From its outset, hardline adherents put out statements and literature pushing a biocentric view of the world, which advocated for veganism, animal rights, pro-life, anti-homosexuality, and a much more militant version of the straight edge philosophy, which advocates for a no alcohol, no drugs, no tobacco lifestyle. The hardline worldview has been accused by critics as ecoauthoritarian. Hardline co-founder Sean Muttaqi adamantly rejected racism and fascism.

A handful of hardline bands existed, the most well known of which were Vegan Reich and Raid. Earth Crisis was loosely aligned with the subculture, but were not necessarily classified as a hardline band.

The heyday of hardline was in the early to mid-1990s when hardline chapters existed in a number of cities across the United States as well in the United Kingdom and Germany. However, by end of the 1990s, the subculture had mostly faded out of existence.

==Beliefs==
The Hardline philosophy forbids its adherents from smoking or chewing any form of tobacco, drinking alcoholic beverages, and using illicit drugs or employing medicine. Hardliners (as they are called) are expected to follow a strict dietary regimen based on the above-mentioned pillars of respect for innocent life and the &quot;natural order&quot;. Hardliners eat only foods that are vegan and relatively natural (e.g. brown rice over white, evaporated cane juice over granulated sugar, organic produce over conventional, natural oils over hydrogenated oils). Human rights issues are also factored into the movement&#x27;s &quot;food politics&quot;, and followers are urged to shun third-world cash crops such as coffee, chocolate, sugar, and most tropical fruits. Hardliners include caffeine in their stance on mind-altering drugs so the first two items are generally abstained from, but consumption of the last two is often given more leeway.

The sexual politics of the Hardline movement are very conservative. Sex is not allowed except for the reason of procreation; thus homosexuality is seen as anathema. Pornography and masturbation are abjured. The use of birth control is avoided, and the practice of abortion is militantly opposed. Although the Hardliner stance on sexual activity is that its natural purpose is purely procreative, many hardliners justify recreational sex within the context of committed relationships as potentially procreative by opting not to use fertility control.

Hardline has always been highly syncretic (over time absorbing influences from Islam and a host of other schools of thought) and initially claimed a Taoist foundation for their sexual morals. This appeal to the orientation of the punk and hardcore scenes met with little success, and the topics of abortion and homosexuality have always been sources of tension between hardliners and their subcultural cousins.

==History==
The hardline subculture grew out of the hardcore punk scene in the 1990s. In the early 1990s, Earth Crisis were one of the first bands to infuse hardcore punk music with strict vegan messaging, and their popularity influenced other bands to follow suit. Hardline began to attract followers shortly after the 1990 release of Vegan Reich&#x27;s &quot;Hardline&quot; EP; shortly thereafter Vegan Reich, and in particular band member Sean Muttaqi, took active leadership in the emerging &quot;Hardline&quot; subculture. Other bands soon formed; the most notable of them being Raid from Tennessee. Another source credited as influencing the creation of Hardline was the militant animal rights group Animal Liberation Front, in operation since 1980.

Muttaqi has said that he was first exposed to the idea of fusing veganism and abstinence from drugs by an English punk named Rat of the band Statement. Rat had allegedly coined the term &quot;vegan straight edge&quot; by the mid-1980s. However, Rat was doing little to spread his ideology while Muttaqi was transforming and propagating it. Vegan Reich was for many in the hardcore scene their first exposure to ideas about militant animal liberation, and the controversy they aroused drew considerable attention to their positions. Those in the subculture who gravitated toward animal-related causes but disagreed with some of hardline&#x27;s finer points found themselves becoming vegan straightedge. Vegan straightedge band Earth Crisis initially wanted Muttaqi to release their debut EP, &quot;All Out War&quot; on his record label, Uprising Records.

Sean Muttaqi, as editor of the zine &quot;Vanguard&quot; (hardline&#x27;s official press organ), was able to exert ideological influence on the movement, and caused the center of its activities to become shifted to Tennessee. Many in the Memphis hardcore scene adopted Hardline stances and started editing magazines, organizing protests, engaging in direct action against industries that exploited animals, and otherwise acting on their new beliefs. Some of the most notable achievements of Memphis Hardline were organizing the movement&#x27;s first annual gathering and founding the long-standing Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade (CAFT). Hardliners were instrumental in CAFT, the Animal Defense League, and Vegans For Life. Some were also involved in Earth First!, anti-imperialist organizations, and other radical causes and groups.

As hardline came into its own, many hardliners decided that their philosophy was so beyond the narrow scene politics of straightedge that the two were entirely different things. The &quot;X&quot; was removed from the crossed rifles logo, straightedge was harshly criticized, and hardliners were encouraged to leave the hardcore scene. Much of this sprang from the momentum being gained by the more activist-oriented elements within the subculture. Eventually hardliners came to consider their network wholly divorced from the hardcore scene. However, the nature of information dissemination in a mostly pre-Internet media environment made recruiting from outside the hardcore subculture next to impossible. Although hardline served to involve people heavily in political activity, the overwhelming bulk of new members were straight-edgers who would with time come to identify primarily as activists instead of hardcore kids. Two of the more famous people associated with Hardline include Animal Liberation Front activist and former prisoner Walter Bond and Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy

In the late 1990s some Hardliners from Massachusetts set out to establish an intentional community in Hawaii. The effort quickly failed due to personality conflicts (especially the ongoing debate among group members as to whether or not cooked food was natural enough) and a distinct lack of required agricultural and engineering skills. This self-defeating arc reflects tensions in similarly idealistic communes of the 1960s and 1970s during the hippie movement and the back-to-the-land movement.

In 1999, a number of punk groups in Salt Lake City, Utah, were designated as criminal gangs by law enforcement. In an internal report, the Salt Lake City Police Department noted three punk factions in the city; Straight Edge, Vegan Straight Edge, and Hardline, and suggested they were &quot;pro-violence, and ... have been responsible for a high number of assaults, stabbings, and beatings in the Salt Lake metro area&quot;. That same year CBS News in Utah ran a report about a number of Salt Lake City Hardliners who had firebombed fast food outlets and clothing stores selling leather items, attributing 30 attacks to Hardliners.

As Hardline began to falter at the end of the 1990s, Muttaqi attempted to stabilise it by organising a &quot;Hardline Central Committee&quot; which would act as an official leadership body for Hardliners. However, this body was not able to stop the breaking a part of Hardline. In 1999, Muttaqi and former Hardliner Micah Collins (aka Adam Naziri) formed an Islamic-oriented group similar to Hardline named Ahl-i Allah (People of God) and, a few years later, this morphed into the nearly identical Taliyah al-Mahdi (Vanguard of the Messiah). Both groups existed primarily online, remained small, and had disappeared by 2006 (until Naziri resurrected the Taliyah website in 2020).

<text>Pinto is a Portuguese, Spanish, Jewish (Sephardic), and Italian surname. It is a high-frequency surname in all Portuguese-speaking countries and is also widely present in Spanish-speaking countries, Italy, India (especially in Mangalore, Karnataka), France and Israel. Historically, it has been common among political elites in Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking countries, as numerous presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state have shared the surname.

In many languages, Pinto means &quot;coloured&quot; or &quot;painted&quot; as it derives from the Late Latin and Classical Latin , and in some cases, at least from the same word in the sense &quot;lively or restless person&quot;. It is linguistically related to the name of Columbus&#x27; ship &quot; La Pinta&quot;, meaning &quot;The Painted One&quot;, &quot;The Look&quot;, or &quot;The Spotted One&quot;. Also related, though greatly diverging in meaning, is the unit of measurement pint, which comes from the Old French word and perhaps ultimately from Vulgar Latin meaning &quot;painted&quot;, for marks painted on the side of a container to show capacity.

<doc id="393988" wikidata="Q3050552" url="?curid=393988" title="Electric Eels (band)">
<text>The Electric Eels (written with lowercase e&#x27;s in honor of E. E. Cummings) were an American rock band active between 1972 and 1975, formed by John D Morton in Cleveland, Ohio.

The electric eels played only five public shows, but during their brief existence they earned a reputation locally for being angry, confrontational and violent. They were notorious for starting fights with audiences which drew police attention; members were also abusive to each other off-stage. Their style was a discordant, noisy amalgam of hard garage rock and free jazz. Stiv Bators, the singer of The Dead Boys was particularly influenced by the vocal styling and stage presence of Dave &quot;E&quot; McManus. While the eels didn&#x27;t play many shows, they rehearsed often, eventually making many recordings which were released many years after their demise.

== Background ==

Along with Morton (guitar), other original members were Dave &quot;E&quot; McManus (vocals, clarinet) and Brian McMahon (guitar; not to be confused with Slint member), all ex-pupils of Lakewood High School, Lakewood, Ohio in 1972. The three had been to see a Captain Beefheart gig and been unimpressed enough by the support band (Youngstown&#x27;s Left End) to decide that they could do better themselves. Unlike other rock groups of the era, Morton had also been influenced by free jazz: &quot;I remember listening to Ornette Coleman, John Cale, Sun Ra and Albert Ayler. That&#x27;s what the eels was supposed to be, but we didn&#x27;t really understand it&quot;. This had also led to early meetings with Peter Laughner of Rocket from the Tombs at the local record store.

The Electric Eels featured unconventional instrumentation initially, with no drummer nor anyone who was technically competent on any musical instruments. Their rare performances did feature at various times, sheet metal hit with sledgehammers, anvils, a power lawnmower and fist fights. This led to the description of their act as &quot;art terrorism&quot;. Much of 1973 and 1974 was spent, mostly unsuccessfully, trying to get gigs in bars that normally booked Top 40 covers bands in Cleveland and then Columbus, where the band moved for some months. Morton has claimed that this move was caused by death threats he had received in Cleveland for sleeping with &quot;one too many married women&quot;. When gigs did happen, promoters were known to pull them half way through. On their debut show the band were arrested by police for being drunk and disorderly. Morton resisted arrest and gained a broken hand, which caused him to play their next gig, three weeks later with an improvised splint made from a slide rule and a wrench.

Morton, in particular, had an inclination for violence that often led to physical fights and temporary splits in the band, or he and Dave E would go to a working class bar and provoke a fight by dancing together as if a homosexual couple.

In late 1973 McMahon left the band, replaced by Paul Marotta, who was a competent musician on both guitar and keyboards and was simultaneously a member of Mirrors. Drummers came and left during the history of the band, but bass guitar was always absent. By early 1975, Marotta had quit and McMahon had returned. Marotta would record the band throughout that year and play during some August recording sessions that also included a bass.

The deliberate provocation and controversy of the band also saw them use the Nazi imagery of the swastika, Morton later claiming that this was influenced by William Burroughs and Lenny Bruce: &quot;That is something we wanted, to have that provocation, we wanted to confront those issues&quot;. In addition, excerpts taken from racist American Nazi Party literature were used as an inspiration sheet for extemporaneous lyrics in the song &quot;Spinach Blasters&quot; (AKA &quot;Spin Age Blasters&quot;). Marotta: &quot;It was shock tactics, it was confrontational art, it was meant to be satire&quot;. This presaged the use of similar shock tactics and images by other punks in New York City and London, such as Johnny Thunders, Sid Vicious and Siouxsie Sioux.

Eventually the Electric Eels got a gig at a Cleveland venue which would support original music, The Viking Saloon&#x27;s &quot;Special Extermination Night&quot; 22 December 1974 with Rocket from the Tombs and Mirrors. This gig marked the public start of a new and unique Cleveland punk rock scene. However the repeat event in January 1975 would see the eels banned from the last bar that would have them, due to their use on stage of a gas-powered lawnmower. This led to the departure from the band of Marotta.

After Marotta left the band, Brian McMahon rejoined and they also recruited drummer Nick Knox, later to find fame with The Cramps. They made their peace with Marotta, who went on to record some of their rehearsals in early 1975. It is these sessions which make up most of the eels material released since their demise, including the 1978 Rough Trade single &quot;Agitated&quot; b/w &quot;Cyclotron&quot;, which was their only released recording for many years. The song &quot;Cyclotron&quot; has a lyrical reference to Elton John whose music and style often crossed over into the glam rock scene.

However, the Knox line-up of the band was short-lived, performing only one gig – the band&#x27;s fifth, overall – at Case Western Reserve University in 1975 (sources differ as to whether this was in May or September of that year), before finally splitting there and then due to a Morton-inspired fist fight.

Later that year the original three eels members, Marotta and two members of Mirrors formed a new band, The Men from UNCLE, but this lasted only two rehearsals before splitting again. Marotta went on to form The Styrenes, of which Morton was also an occasional member.

<doc id="393991" wikidata="Q927765" url="?curid=393991" title="National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics">
<text>The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) established in 1940, is a college athletics association for colleges and universities in North America. Most colleges and universities in the NAIA offer athletic scholarships to their student athletes. Around $1.3 billion in athletic scholarship financial aid is awarded to student athletes annually.

For the 2023–24 season, it had 241 member institutions, of which two are in British Columbia, one in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the rest in the continental United States, with over 83,000 student-athletes participating. The NAIA, whose headquarters is in Kansas City, Missouri, sponsors 28 national championships. CBS Sports Network, formerly called CSTV, serves as the national media outlet for the NAIA. In 2014, ESPNU began carrying the NAIA Football National Championship.

==History==
In 1937, James Naismith and local leaders, including George Goldman and Emil S. Liston, staged the first National College Basketball Tournament at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri, of which Goldman was director, one year before the first National Invitation Tournament and two years before the first NCAA tournament. The goal of the tournament was to establish a forum for small colleges and universities to determine a national basketball champion. The original eight-team tournament expanded to 32 teams in 1938. On March 10, 1940, the National Association for Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) was formed in Kansas City, Missouri.

In 1952, the NAIB was transformed into the NAIA, and with that came the sponsorship of additional sports such as men&#x27;s golf, tennis and outdoor track and field. Football in the NAIA was split into two divisions in 1970, based on enrollment (Divisions I and II); it was consolidated back into a single division in 1997.

===African-American participation===
The 1948 NAIB national tournament was the first intercollegiate postseason to feature a Black student-athlete, Clarence Walker of Indiana State under coach John Wooden. Wooden had withdrawn from the 1947 tournament because the NAIB would not allow Walker to play.

The association furthered its commitment to African-American athletes when, in 1953, it became the first collegiate association to invite historically black colleges and universities into its membership. In 1957, Tennessee A&amp;I (now Tennessee State) became the first historically Black institution to win a collegiate basketball national championship. In 1959, Southern University became the first HBCU to win the NAIA Baseball championship.

===Transgender participation===

In 2024, NAIA instituted a ban on transgender men who have begun transgender hormone therapy and all transgender women from competing in women’s sports, with the exception of cheerleading and dance.

===Female participation===
The NAIA began sponsoring intercollegiate championships for women in 1980, the second coed national athletics association to do so, offering collegiate athletics championships to women in basketball, cross country, gymnastics, indoor and outdoor track and field, softball, swimming and diving, tennis and volleyball. The National Junior College Athletic Association had established a women&#x27;s division in the spring of 1975 and held the first women&#x27;s national championship volleyball tournament that fall.

In 1997, Liz Heaston became the first female college athlete to play and score in a college football game when she kicked two extra points during the 1997 Linfield vs. Willamette football game.

===Champions of Character===
Launched in 2000 by the NAIA, the Champions of Character program promotes character and sportsmanship through athletics. The Champions of Character conducts clinics and has developed an online training course to educate athletes, coaches, and athletic administrators with the skills necessary to promote character development in the context of sport.

=== Eligibility Center ===
In 2010, the association opened the NAIA Eligibility Center, where prospective student-athletes are evaluated for academic and athletic eligibility.

===Other firsts===
Membership – The NAIA was the first association to admit colleges and universities from outside the United States. The NAIA began admitting Canadian members in 1967.

Football – The NAIA was the first association to send a football team to Europe to play. In the summer of 1976, the NAIA sent Henderson State and Texas A&amp;I to play 5 exhibition games in West Berlin, Vienna, Nuremberg, Mannheim and Paris.

Flag football – In May 2020, the NAIA, in partnership with the National Football League (NFL), announced the addition of flag football as a varsity sport for female student-athletes. The NAIA became the first collegiate governing body to sanction the sport at the varsity level. Women&#x27;s flag began during the 2021 season as an emerging sport with about 15 teams.

Name, image, and likeness reform — In October 2020, the NAIA passed legislation that allows student-athletes at its member institutions to be compensated for the use of their name, image, and likeness (NIL). According to an NAIA press release, student-athletes can now &quot;receive compensation for promoting any commercial product, enterprise, or for any public or media appearance&quot;, and can also &quot;reference their intercollegiate athletic participation in such promotions or appearances.&quot; The NAIA had allowed student-athletes to receive NIL compensation since 2014, but had not previously allowed them to reference their status as such. The NAIA was several years ahead of the NCAA in NIL reform; the NCAA did not adopt NIL reform until 2021, after its hand was forced by multiple states passing legislation to allow student-athletes to receive such compensation, most notably California. In December 2020, Chloe Mitchell, a volleyball player at NAIA member Aquinas College who at the time had more than 2 million followers on TikTok with a series of do-it-yourself home improvement videos, became the first college student-athlete known to have profited from an endorsement under the current rules.

==Championship sports==
The NAIA sponsors 16 sports in which it conducts 28 annual championships (13 for men, 13 for women, 2 co-ed). The NAIA recognizes three levels of competitions: &quot;emerging&quot; (15 or more institutions sponsoring as varsity and declared), &quot;invitational&quot; (25 or more institutions sponsoring as varsity and declared for postseason, Approval of the National Administrative Council), and &quot;championship&quot; (40 or more institutions sponsoring as varsity, Minimum of two Invitationals held, Approval of the National Administrative Council). The association conducts, or has conducted in the past, championship tournaments in the following sports (year established).

===Basketball championships===
*Men&#x27;s basketball
**Division I (1937–present)
**Division II (1992–2020)
*Women&#x27;s basketball
**Division I (1981–present)
**Division II (1992–2020)

The NAIA men&#x27;s basketball championship is the longest-running collegiate national championship of any sport in the United States. The tournament was the brainchild of Dr. James Naismith, creator of the game of basketball; Emil Liston, athletic director at Baker University; and Frank Cramer, founder of Cramer Athletic Products.

The event began in 1937 with the inaugural tournament at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. The 2017 men&#x27;s championship marked the 80th edition of what has been tabbed College Basketball&#x27;s Toughest Tournament. The tournament has awarded the Chuck Taylor Most Valuable Player award since 1939, as well as the Charles Stevenson Hustle Award (&quot;Charlie Hustle&quot;), which was the basis for Pete Rose&#x27;s nickname, given to him by Whitey Ford. From 1992 to 2020, basketball was the only NAIA sport in which the organization&#x27;s member institutions were aligned into divisions.

Effective with the 2020–21 academic year, the NAIA returned to a single division for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball.

<text>Ishmael Wadada Leo Smith (born December 18, 1941) is an American trumpeter and composer, working primarily in the field of creative music. He was one of three finalists for the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Music for &quot;Ten Freedom Summers&quot;, released on May 22, 2012.

==Biography==
Smith was born in Leland, Mississippi, United States. He started out playing drums, mellophone, and French horn before he settled on the trumpet. He played in various R&amp;B groups and, by 1967, became a member of the AACM and co-founded the Creative Construction Company, a trio with Leroy Jenkins and Anthony Braxton. In 1971, Smith formed his own label, Kabell. He also formed another band, the New Dalta Ahkri, with members including Henry Threadgill, Anthony Davis and Oliver Lake.

In the 1970s, Smith studied ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University. He played again with Anthony Braxton, as well as recording with Derek Bailey&#x27;s Company. In the mid-1980s, Smith became Rastafarian and began using the name Wadada. In 1993, he began teaching at Cal Arts, a position he held until 2014. In addition to trumpet and flugelhorn, Smith plays several world music instruments, including the koto, kalimba, and atenteben (Ghanaian bamboo flute). He has also taught courses in instrument making. His compositions often use a graphic notation system he calls &quot;Ankhrasmation&quot;, which he developed in 1970.

In 1998, Smith and guitarist Henry Kaiser released &quot;Yo, Miles!&quot;, a tribute to Miles Davis&#x27;s then-lesser-known 1970s electric period. On this album, Smith, Kaiser and a large cast of musicians recorded cover versions and original compositions inspired by Miles&#x27;s electric music. The follow-ups &quot;Sky Garden&quot; (released by Cuneiform in 2004) and &quot;Upriver&quot; (released in 2005) were recorded with a different cast of musicians. Both line-ups featured Michael Manring on bass.

Smith&#x27;s Golden Quartet (with which he has released several albums) originally featured Jack DeJohnette on drums, Anthony Davis on keyboards, and Malachi Favors on bass. After several iterations, the Golden Quartet now features Pheeroan akLaff on drums, John Lindberg on bass, and Davis on piano.

During the 2000s, Smith recorded albums for John Zorn&#x27;s label Tzadik, as well as Pi Recordings. In 2008, he and his Golden Quartet released a DVD entitled &quot;Freedom Now&quot;.

Smith has lived in New Haven, Connecticut for many years, a city where he helped create a prominent culture for creative music.

<text>The Imperial Order of Saint Prince Vladimir () was an Imperial Russian order established on by Empress Catherine II in memory of the deeds of Saint Vladimir, the Grand Prince and the Baptizer of the Kievan Rus&#x27;.

== Grades ==
The order had four degrees and was awarded for continuous civil and military service. People who had been awarded with the St. Vladimir Order for military merits bore it with a special fold on the ribbon – &quot;with a bow&quot;. There was a certain hierarchy of Russian Orders. According to this, the First Class Order of Saint Vladimir was the second one—the first was the Saint George Order—by its significance.

According to Russian laws on nobility, people who were awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir had the rights of hereditary nobility until the Emperor&#x27;s decree of 1900 was issued. After this, only three first classes of the order gave such a right, the last one granting only personal nobility.

Today, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, claimant to the Headship of the Russian Imperial House, continues to award the Russian Imperial Order of Saint Vladimir as a dynastic order of knighthood. The validity of her awards is disputed by some historians and by some members of the Romanov Family Association.

=== Styles ===

; First class: A red cross with black and golden borders; the badge of the order depended from a sash worn over the right shoulder, and a gold-and-silver eight-rayed star was fastened over the left chest
; Second class: The red cross on the neck and the star over the left chest
; Third class: The red cross of a smaller size on the neck
; Fourth class: The red cross over the left chest

== Insignia ==

A red enamelled cross pattée with black enamelled borders, and a black enamelled central disc bearing a crowned red and ermine mantle with the monogram of Saint Vladimir. Worn on a sash by the first degree, on a necklet by the second and third degrees, and on a chest ribbon by the fourth degree.

A four-pointed star superimposed upon a four-pointed gold star, with a golden cross pattée and the letters &quot;CPKB&quot; between the arms of the cross on a black enamel background at the centre surrounded by the motto of the order &quot;Benefit, Honour and Glory&quot;.

Worn on the left chest by the first and second degrees. This motto was transferred to present-day star of the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, which was established in 1992 by President Boris Yeltsin and is today the second highest ranking decoration of that country.

== Order of Saint Vladimir of the Russian Orthodox Church ==
In 1957, in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Patriarch of Moscow&#x27;s restoration in Russia, an Order of Saint Vladimir was created by the Russian Orthodox Church. The order is to be awarded to priests and nuns of the Orthodox church for their service to the Soviet Union and later Russia.

There are three degrees of the order. It has no relation to the imperial order.

<text>Logical possibility refers to a logical proposition that cannot be disproved, using the axioms and rules of a given system of logic. The logical possibility of a proposition will depend upon the system of logic being considered, rather than on the violation of any single rule. Some systems of logic restrict inferences from inconsistent propositions or even allow for true contradictions. Other logical systems have more than two truth-values instead of a binary of such values. Some assume the system in question is classical propositional logic. Similarly, the criterion for logical possibility is often based on whether or not a proposition is contradictory and as such, is often thought of as the broadest type of possibility.

In modal logic, a logical proposition is possible if it is true in some possible world. The universe of &quot;possible worlds&quot; depends upon the axioms and rules of the logical system in which one is working, but given some logical system, any logically consistent collection of statements is a possible world. The modal diamond operator formula_1 is used to express possibility: formula_2 denotes &quot;proposition formula_3 is possible&quot;.

Logical possibility is different from other sorts of subjunctive possibilities. The relationship between modalities (if there is any) is the subject of debate and may depend upon how one views logic, as well as the relationship between logic and metaphysics, for example, many philosophers following Saul Kripke have held that discovered identities such as &quot;Hesperus = Phosphorus&quot; are metaphysically necessary because they pick out the same object in all possible worlds where the terms have a referent. It is logically possible for “Hesperus = Phosphorus” to be false, since denying it does not violate a logical rule such as consistency. Other philosophers are of the view that logical possibility is broader than metaphysical possibility, so that anything which is metaphysically possible is also logically possible.

<doc id="394027" wikidata="Q380421" url="?curid=394027" title="Nouhak Phoumsavanh">
<text>Nouhak Phoumsavanh or Phoumsavan (; ; 9 April 1910– 9 September 2008) was a longtime Pathet Lao revolutionary and communist party official who was the 3rd President of Laos from 1992 to 1998.

==Life ==
Nouhak was born in Ban Phalouka in Mukdahan Province, Siam (now Thailand) in 1910, according to official sources, although his year of birth has also been given as 1914. He married his first wife, Chanthome, in 1933 and they had four children, Phouthone, Phonesavanh, Khankeo and a son. He later remarried in 1944 to Bounema, who was of Vietnamese descent. 

==Political career==
He was a founding member of the Lao revolutionary movement in 1945, and he became Chairman of the Lao Resistance Committee for the Eastern Region in 1949. In the Lao Resistance Government, he was named Minister of Finance in 1950. He participated in the founding congress of the Lao People&#x27;s Party (later renamed the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party, LPRP) in 1955 and was elected as the second-ranking member of its Central Committee (Deputy Director of the Central Committee).

Nouhak was subsequently the secretary of the Lao People&#x27;s Party cell in Vientiane, the capital, and was a member of the National Assembly in 1958. He was arrested in 1959 and spent a year in prison in Vientiane before escaping along with Souphanouvong. He was then secretary of the party cell in Khangkhay and had important roles in the party during the 1960s and 1970s, while the Laotian Civil War was ongoing. He was elected to the Politburo at the LPRP&#x27;s 2nd Congress in February 1972 and was assigned responsibility for economic affairs.

When the Pathet Lao took power in December 1975, Nouhak was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. For years, he was considered &quot;Number 2&quot; in the leadership under Prime Minister Kaysone Phomvihane. He was elected as First Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers in April 1982, then as a standing member of the Council of Ministers in charge of economic affairs in November 1986. Nouhak was subsequently elected to the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly in 1989 and became President of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly in the same year. Also in 1989, he was chosen as chairman of the commission charged with drafting a new constitution, which was adopted in 1991. With the adoption of this constitution, Kaysone assumed the presidency, which was transformed from a ceremonial to an executive position. After Kaysone&#x27;s death, Nouhak was elected to succeed him as President of Laos by the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly in an extraordinary session on November 25, 1992.

Despite the presidency&#x27;s executive powers, Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon held the country&#x27;s most powerful position as General Secretary of the LPRP. When Khamtai decided to move from Prime Minister to President in 1998, Nouhak, who was by then one of the oldest heads of state in the world, retired, leaving office on 24 February 1998.

Nouhak remained on the Central Committee and Politburo of the LPRP until the party&#x27;s 6th Congress in 1996. At the 6th Congress in 1996 and the 7th Congress in 2001, he was named as Adviser to the Central Committee&#x27;s Executive Committee. He reportedly remained in good health throughout his old age, and he was said to have continued making visits to the provinces by helicopter until 2007. 

== Later life ==
Nouhak died on 9 September 2008 at the age of 98. The state news agency attributed his death simply to &quot;old age&quot;, while noting that he had received medical treatment both in Laos and outside the country. A committee of 26 members, including leading party and state figures (with President Choummaly Sayasone as its chairman), was formed to organize his funeral, and a five-day national mourning period was declared for 10–14 September, during which time all entertainment was prohibited. He was cremated in Vientiane on 14 September.

In 2011, a memorial honoring him was erected at his birthplace in Mukdahan Province.

<text>The Battle of Oenophyta took place between Athens and the Boeotian city-states in 457 BC during the First Peloponnesian War.

In this period between the Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War, alliances and leagues sprang up and collapsed, although there was very little prolonged warfare. In 457 BC Athens, the leader of the Delian League, came into conflict with Corinth and their ally Sparta (leader of the Peloponnesian League) over Megara; 62 days prior to the Battle of Oenophyta, the Athenians were defeated at the Battle of Tanagra by Sparta, but Sparta had lost so many men that they could not take advantage of their victory. 

The Athenians, who had 14,000 men at Tanagra, regrouped after that battle and marched into Boeotia. At Oenophyta, led by Myronides they defeated the Boeotians, and then destroyed the walls of Tanagra and ravaged Locrida and Phocis. Their victory at Oenophyta was quickly followed by the surrender of Aegina, and the completion of the construction of the Long Walls to the Athenian port of Piraeus (an action opposed by Sparta). 

Athens remained in control of Boeotia until 447 BC, when they were defeated at the Battle of Coronea.

<text>The NAIA football national championship is decided by a post-season playoff system featuring the best National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) college football teams in the United States. Under sponsorship of the NAIA, the championship game has been played annually since 1956. 

In 1970, NAIA football was divided into two divisions based on enrollment, Division I and [[NAIA Division II football national championship|Division II]], with a championship game played in each division. In 1997, NAIA football was again consolidated back into one division.

<text>John George Lynch-Staunton (June 19, 1930 – August 17, 2012) was a Canadian senator, who served as interim leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, from December 2003 to March 2004. He represented the Senate division of Grandville, Quebec. Lynch-Staunton was the first Senator to lead a federal political party since Arthur Meighen from 1941 to 1942.

==Early years and education==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Lynch-Staunton was educated at Collège Stanislas and Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf in Montreal. He obtained a B.Sc in Foreign Service from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. in 1953, and did graduate work towards a Master of Arts degree in Canadian History at Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Ontario, from 1953 to 1955.

==Family==
Lynch-Staunton married Juliana de Kuyper in 1958. The couple had five children: Mark (d: 2013), Peter (d: 2015), Gabrielle, Sophie and Sean.
Lynch-Staunton has 9 grandchildren: Caitlin, Harrison, Connor, Juliana, Aidan, Jaryd, Monique, Jack, Matthew and Tyce (b: 2016).

==City councillor==
Lynch-Staunton was elected to the city council of Montreal in 1960. He represented the district of Côte-des-Neiges and was a member of Mayor Jean Drapeau&#x27;s Parti civique de Montréal. He was re-elected in 1962, 1966 and 1970. Mayor Drapeau appointed him to the executive committee as vice chairman. In 1974 he lost his bid for re-election to Nick Auf der Maur as the &quot;Rassemblement des citoyens et citoyennes de Montréal (RCM)&quot; achieved its first political breakthrough.

==Provincial politics==
Lynch-Staunton ran as a Union Nationale candidate for a provincial by-election in the district of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in 1968. He was defeated by Liberal candidate William Tetley.

==Senator==
Lynch-Staunton was appointed to the Senate on the recommendation of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on September 23, 1990. The following year, he was appointed Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, and he became Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in December 1993 following the Liberal victory in that year&#x27;s general election. From December 8, 2003, with the merger of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada ratified by both parties, he served as interim leader of the new Conservative Party of Canada until the election of Stephen Harper in March 2004. &quot;Lynch-Staunton&#x27;s high-road leadership of a Senate majority in opposition to an elected majority government in the Commons is a model for students of Parliament – and for future reference when history repeats itself&quot;. He remained Leader of the Opposition in the Senate until September 30, 2004, and retired from Parliament when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 on June 19, 2005.

==Retirement==
Lynch-Staunton won a council seat in Stanstead in the Quebec municipal elections on November 1, 2009.

==Death==
Lynch-Staunton died on August 17, 2012, following a heart attack while he was at a family reunion in Pincher Creek, Alberta; he was 82 years old.

<doc id="394045" wikidata="Q6345975" url="?curid=394045" title="Kaena Point">
<text>Kaena or Kaena Point is the westernmost tip of the island of Oahu. In Hawaiian, &quot;kaena&quot; means &quot;the heat&quot;. The area was named after a brother or cousin of Pele. The point is designated as a Natural Area Reserve.

==History==
According to ancient Hawaiian folklore, Kaena Point is the &quot;jumping-off&quot; point for souls leaving this world.

In 1899, the Oahu Railway and Land Company constructed a railway that encompassed 70 miles from Honolulu through Kahuku to transport sugarcane. Most of the tracks were destroyed by a tsunami in 1946. Parts of them are visible along the Ka&#x27;ena Point Trail.

==Ecology==
Ka&#x27;ena Point sustains an ecosystem that is home to many native Hawaiian plants and animals.

Plants:
* ‘ohai (&quot;Sesbania tomentosa&quot;)
* naupaka kahakai (&quot;Scaevola sericea&quot;)
* ‘ilima papa (&quot;Sida falax&quot;)
* naio (&quot;Myoporum sandwicense&quot;)
* pa‘u-o-Hi‘iaka (&quot;Jacquemontia ovalifolia&quot;)
* ma‘o - Hawaiian cotton (&quot;Gossypium tomentosum&quot;)
* Ka‘ena ‘akoko (&quot;Chamaesyce celastroides&quot; var. &quot;kaenana&quot;)
* hinahina (&quot;Heliotropium anomulum&quot;)
* pohinahina (&quot;Vitex rotundifolia&quot;)
* nehe (&quot;Lipochaeta integrifolia&quot;)
* &#x27;Ahinahina (&quot;Achyranthes splendens&quot;)

Animals:
* Hawaiian monk seal (&quot;Neomonachus schauinslandi&quot;)
* Moli (&quot;Phoebastria immutabilis&quot;)
* Yellow-faced bees (&quot;Hylaeus longiceps&quot;)

===Preservation===

In 2011, the United States&#x27; first predator-proof fence was constructed at Ka’ena Point, costing about $290,000. The fence is about 2,133 feet long (650 m), and encompasses of land. The population of wedge-tailed shearwater fledglings, Laysan albatross fledglings, ohia, sandalwood trees, and several other species has risen significantly.

==Access==
Ka&#x27;ena Point is a park and hiking site, and is also known for snorkeling. This spot has a white sandy beach that runs from Oahu&#x27;s western tip to the Waianae Mountains. A can be entered from Keawaula Beach or Mokuleia.

Until January 28, 1998, when professional surfer Ken Bradshaw was photographed riding a wave with a reported face, it was believed that Greg Noll&#x27;s 1969 photo had showed the largest wave ever photographed. During that famous swell in January 1998, several people reported seeing waves with faces at Kaena Point.

<text>Réal Ménard (born May 13, 1962) is a Canadian politician, who was a Bloc Québécois member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2009. He was the second Canadian member of Parliament to come out as gay.

Ménard is a political scientist with B.A. and M.A. degrees and also holds his law degree from the University of Ottawa.

==Federal politics==
He first stood for federal office in the 1984 federal election as candidate for the small Parti nationaliste du Québec in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. Defeated in this first try, he contested the riding in the 1993 election for the new and larger Bloc Québécois. He was elected, and re-elected in the riding in the 1997 and 2000 elections. Following redistricting, he was re-elected in the new riding of Hochelaga in the 2004, 2006 and 2008 federal elections.

Early in his parliamentary career, he served variously as Bloc critic for Health, for science, research and development, for Labour, for National Defence, and for the Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec. From 1998 to June 29, 1999, he was critic for Citizenship and Immigration and for public housing; he then returned as health critic and served as vice-chair of the Standing Committee for three sessions. On September 14, 2001, he took on additional critic responsibility for the Montreal region.

On February 15, 1994, Ménard was the first member in the house of commons to use the word &#x27;internet&#x27; saying &quot;in building the electronic highway, the government will respect areas of provincial jurisdiction and ensure that communications linking us to Internet are also in French&quot; 

In March 2006 he was shuffled from the health critic position to become the Bloc Québécois justice critic.

==Municipal politics==

In June 2009, Ménard announced that he was resigning from the House of Commons, effective September 16, in order to run as a Vision Montreal candidate for borough mayor of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in Montreal&#x27;s 2009 municipal election. Prior to his first election to the House of Commons, he was a political assistant to Louise Harel, Vision Montreal&#x27;s 2009 candidate for Mayor of Montreal, when she was a provincial MNA.

He won election to the borough mayoralty on November 1, 2009.

<doc id="394048" wikidata="Q525361" url="?curid=394048" title="Justification (jurisprudence)">
<text>Justification is a defense in a criminal case, by which a defendant who committed the acts asserts that because what they did meets certain legal standards, they are not criminally culpable for the acts which would otherwise be criminal. Justification and excuse are related but different defenses (see Justification and excuse).

Justification is an exception to the prohibition of committing certain offenses. Justification can be a defense in a prosecution for a criminal offense. When an act is justified, a person is not criminally liable even though their act would otherwise constitute an offense. For example, to intentionally commit a homicide would be considered murder. However, it is not considered a crime if committed in self-defense. In addition to self-defense, the other justification defenses are defense of others, defense of property, and necessity.

A justification is not the same as an excuse. In contrast, an excuse is a defense that recognizes a crime was committed, but that for the defendant, although committing a socially undesirable crime, conviction and punishment would be morally inappropriate because of an extenuating personal inadequacy, such as mental defect, lack of mental capacity, sufficient age, intense fear of death, lacking the ability to control their own conduct, etc.

<text>The Vancouver Art Gallery (VAG) is an art museum in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The museum occupies a adjacent to Robson Square in downtown Vancouver, making it the largest art museum in Western Canada by building size. Designed by Francis Rattenbury, the building the museum occupies was originally opened as a provincial courthouse, before it was re-purposed for museum use in the early 1980s. The building was designated the Former Vancouver Law Courts National Historic Site of Canada in 1980.

The museum first opened its doors to the public in 1931, housed within a structure crafted by the architectural firm Sharp and Johnston. In 1950, the museum underwent its initial expansion within this original building. Later, the institution embarked on a transition to the former provincial courthouse premises, with the relocation being completed in 1983. Subsequently, in the late 2000s and 2010s, the museum initiated plans for a further relocation to a new facility situated in Larwill Park.

The Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection serves as a repository of art for the Lower Mainland region, and has approximately 12,000 works by artists from Canada, and around the world. As of 2020, the museum holds seasonal exhibitions as well as hosts travelling exhibitions.

==History==
In April 1931, the Vancouver Art Gallery Association was established under the provincial &quot;Society Act&quot;, in order to establish and maintain a museum for the City of Vancouver. The Association opened the art museum to the public at 1145 West Georgia Street on 5 October 1931. The building was designed by architectural firm Sharp and Johnston, and featured four galleries, one of which included a sculpture hall, a lecture hall, and a library. The cost to construct the building was approximately .
Works by British, and other European artists dominated the works exhibited at the museum at the time of its opening. In 1938, the museum was one of the buildings occupied by unemployed protesters during a sitdown strike in the weeks leading up to Bloody Sunday. Paintings were not damaged while the protesters occupied the building.

In 1950, the museum conducted renovations to its building, reshaping the design of the building towards an International Style of architecture; with the removal of the building&#x27;s Art Deco facade. Renovations were also conducted to accommodate the 157 works bequeathed to the museum by Emily Carr, with the building reopened to the public in 1951. Cost for the renovation was approximately , funded by the City of Vancouver government, and funds raised by Lawren Harris.

In 1983 the museum was relocated to its present location, the former provincial courthouse. The building continues to be owned by the Government of British Columbia, although the museum occupies the building through a 99-year sublease signed with the City of Vancouver government in 1974; who in turn leases the building from the provincial government. Before the re-purposed building was opened to the public, it was renovated by architect Arthur Erickson at a cost of million, as a part of his larger three city-block Robson Square redevelopment. The gallery connects to the rest of Robson Square via an underground passage below Robson Street.

===Relocation planning===
Planning to relocate the museum began as early as 2004, a result from the gallery&#x27;s need for more exhibition and storage space for its collections. In November 2007, the museum announced plans to move to seek the approval of Vancouver City Council to build a new building at Larwill Park. In May 2008, the municipal government and the museum announced plans to relocate around the Plaza of Nations. However, Vancouver City Council later reversed its decision in April 2013, opting to approve the original proposed site in Larwill Park. The museum would occupy the building under similar arrangements as the former courthouse, with the museum leasing the property from the City of Vancouver.

The museum issued a request for qualifications for a new building design in September 2013. Herzog &amp; de Meuron&#x27;s bid was selected by the museum in April 2014. The development of the Vancouver Art Gallery&#x27;s new building is the first project for the architectural firm in the country. Perkins and Will&#x27;s Vancouver branch was contracted as the project&#x27;s executive architects.

The building was originally planned to be completed in 2020, and was named the Chan Centre for the Visual Arts after a major donor. However, developments for the project stalled due to a funding dispute between the federal and provincial governments. As of March 2023, the new building&#x27;s cost is estimated at $400 million. As of March 2023, the museum has raised over $340 million from public and private sources. Over $190 million was raised through private donations, including a $40 million contribution from the Chan Foundation in 2019 and a $100 million donation from the Audain Foundation in 2021. The latter was the largest cash donation to a Canadian public art museum.

Groundbreaking for the new museum building occurred on 15 September 2023.

On the 3 December 2024 the new gallery plans were cancelled and new design is to be selected. Constructed was halted over the summer due to costs rising from $400 million to $600 million.

==Building==

The art museum is in the former provincial courthouse for Vancouver. The neoclassical building was designed by Francis Rattenbury after winning a design competition in 1905. The building was opened as a provincial courthouse in 1911, and operated as such until 1979, with the provincial courts moved to the Law Courts south of the building. The building was designated the Former Vancouver Law Courts National Historic Site of Canada in 1980. Both the main and annex portions of the building are also designated &quot;A&quot; heritage structures by the municipal government. The Vancouver Art Gallery moved into the former courthouse in 1983.

The Centennial Fountain on the Georgia Street side of the building was installed in 1966 to commemorate the centennial of the union of the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia; although it was later removed in 2017 as part of the Georgia Street plaza renovations. Shortly after the provincial courts moved out of the building, the building was renovated for museum use, and as a part of Arthur Erickson&#x27;s redevelopment of Robson Square. The Annex Building is the only part of the building complex that was not converted for museum use.

The design of the building includes ionic columns, a central dome, formal porticos, and ornate stonework. The building was constructed using marble imported from Alaska, Tennessee, and Vermont. Construction for the building began in 1906 and replaced the previous courthouse at Victory Square. At the time, the building contained 18 courtrooms. An annex designed by Thomas Hooper was added to the western side of the building in 1912. It was declared a heritage site and retains the original judges&#x27; benches and walls as they were when the building was a courthouse.

A notable feature of the building is a pair of granite lions, placed on either side of the old entrance to the courthouse. They were carved from granite chunks brought from Nelson Island and placed in their current location in 1910. On November 4, 1942, two dynamite blasts damages the rear end of the western lion. The blasts also shattered the windows of surrounding hotels and cause some people to believe the city was under air attack. Two stonecutters who had worked on the original carvings and who were still working, John Whitworth and Herbert Ede, were hired to carve and fit new hindquarters; the join line is still visible. The culprits were never found.

===Gathering place===
The front lawn and steps of the building has hosted a number of public gatherings and protests. The building serves as the monthly meeting spot for Vancouver&#x27;s Critical Mass, as well as flash mobs, the Zombie Walk, pro-marijuana rallies, and numerous environmental demonstrations. The steps on both the Robson Street and Georgia Street sides of the building are popular gathering spots for protest rallies. The Georgia Street side is also a popular place in the summertime for people to relax or socialize.

In February 12, 2007, the 2010 Olympic countdown clock was placed in the front lawn of the building. It was open for free for the public to see. The clock has since been disassembled after the games, with one half going to BC Place and the other to Whistler Village.

In June 2021, Cheryle Gunargie created a vigil in honour of the unmarked remains of children discovered at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. The vigil consists of 215 pairs of shoes, one for each of the children whose remains were discovered.

==Permanent collection==

As of December 2018, the Vancouver Art Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection had approximately 12,000 works by Canadian, and international artists. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection is formally owned by the City of Vancouver, with the museum acting as the custodians for the collection under a lease and license agreement. The permanent collection acts as the principal repository of works produced in the Lower Mainland region, with museum acquisitions typically focused on historical and contemporary art from the region. Approximately half of the works in its collection were produced by artists from Western Canada. In addition to art from the region, the collection also has a focus on First Nations art, and art from Asia. The museum&#x27;s collection is organized into several smaller areas, contemporary art from Asia, photography and conceptual photography, works by indigenous Canadian artists from the region, and artists from Vancouver and British Columbia.

The museum&#x27;s photography and conceptual art collection includes photographs from the 1950s to the present, and includes photos by the N.E. Thing Co. artist collective, photographers of the Vancouver School of conceptual photography, and other artists including Dan Graham, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff, Cindy Sherman, Robert Smithson, and Thomas Struth. The museum&#x27;s collection of contemporary Asian art includes works by Eikoh Hosoe, Mariko Mori, Fiona Tan, Jin-me Yoon, Reena Saini Kallat, Song Dong, Wang Du, Wang Jianwei, Yang Fudong, and O Zhang.

===Canadian art===

Serving as a repository for art for the region, the museum holds a number of works by artists based in the Lower Mainland, in addition to artists based in other regions of British Columbia. 

The museum&#x27;s collection includes works from Canadian artists, including members of the Group of Seven, Gathie Falk, Michael Snow, and Joyce Wieland. The museum&#x27;s collection also features a significant number of works by Emily Carr, dating from 1913 to 1942. The painting &quot;Totem Poles, Kitseukla&quot;, by Carr, was among the original set of works acquired for the museum&#x27;s collection prior to opening in 1931. As of 2023, the museum has over 250 works by Carr. The permanent collections of the Vancouver Art Gallery, along with the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, hold the largest number of works by Carr of any collection in the world.

In December 2023, the museum officially acknowledged 10 of its Group of Seven J.E.H. MacDonald oil sketches, acquired in 2015, as forgeries, with an exhibit.

The museum&#x27;s also features a collection of indigenous Canadian art from the region, including works from Haida, Heiltsuk, Inuit, Kwakwakaʼwakw, Nuu-chah-nulth, Nuxalk, and Tlingit artists. Regular acquisitions of indigenous Canadian works was undertaken by the museum beginning in the 1980s; with the museum&#x27;s practices prior to the 1980s typically leaving the acquisition of indigenous Canadian works for the collections of ethnographic, or history museums. In 2015, George Gund III bequeathed to the museum 37 First Nations works, including totem poles by Ken Mowatt and Norman Tait, drawings by Bill Reid, and thirteen carved works by Robert Davidson. Other works in the museum&#x27;s indigenous Canadian collection includes works by Sonny Assu, Rebecca Belmore, Dempsey Bob, Dana Claxton, Joe David, Reg Davidson, Beau Dick, Brian Jungen, Marianne Nicolson, and Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun.
