<text>Marriage in the Catholic Church, also known as holy matrimony, is the &quot;covenant by which a man and woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life and which is ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring&quot;, and which &quot;has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament between the baptized&quot;. Catholic matrimonial law, based on Roman law regarding its focus on marriage as a free mutual agreement or contract, became the basis for the marriage law of all European countries, at least up to the Reformation.

The Catholic Church recognizes as sacramental, (1) the marriages between two baptized non-Catholic Christians or between two baptized Orthodox Christians, as well as (2) marriages between baptized non-Catholic Christians and Catholic Christians, although in the latter case, consent from the diocesan bishop must be obtained, with this termed &quot;dispensation to enter into a mixed marriage&quot;. To illustrate (1), for example, &quot;if two Lutherans marry in the Lutheran Church in the presence of a Lutheran minister, the Catholic Church recognizes this as a valid sacrament of marriage&quot;. On the other hand, although the Catholic Church recognizes marriages between two non-Christians or those between a Catholic Christian and a non-Christian, these are not considered to be sacramental, and in the latter case, the Catholic Christian must seek permission from his/her bishop for the marriage to occur; this permission is known as &quot;dispensation from disparity of cult&quot;.

Weddings in which both parties are Catholic faithful are ordinarily held in a Catholic church, while weddings in which one party is a Catholic faithful and the other party is a non-Catholic can be held in a Catholic church or a non-Catholic church, but in the latter case permission of one&#x27;s Bishop or ordinary is required for the marriage to be free of defect of form. 

== Catholic Church view of the importance of marriage ==

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states: &quot;The intimate community of life and love which constitutes the married state has been established by the Creator and endowed by him with its own proper laws. . . . God himself is the author of marriage. The vocation to marriage is written in the very nature of man and woman as they came from the hand of the Creator. Marriage is not a purely human institution despite the many variations it may have undergone through the centuries in different cultures, social structures, and spiritual attitudes. These differences should not cause us to forget its common and permanent characteristics. Although the dignity of this institution is not transparent everywhere with the same clarity, some sense of the greatness of the matrimonial union exists in all cultures. The well-being of the individual person and of both human and Christian society is closely bound up with the healthy state of conjugal and family life&quot;.

It also says: &quot;The Church attaches great importance to Jesus&#x27; presence at the wedding at Cana. She sees in it the confirmation of the goodness of marriage and the proclamation that thenceforth marriage will be an efficacious sign of Christ&#x27;s presence. In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original meaning of the union of man and woman as the Creator willed it from the beginning: permission given by Moses to divorce one&#x27;s wife was a concession to the hardness of hearts. The matrimonial union of man and woman is indissoluble; God himself has determined it, &#x27;what therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder&#x27;. This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy – heavier than the Law of Moses. By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God&quot;.

==History of marriage in the Catholic Church==

===Early period===
Marriage was considered a necessary passage into adulthood, and strongly supported within the Jewish faith. The author of the letter to the Hebrews declared that marriage should be held in honor among all, and early Christians defended the holiness of marriage against the Gnostics and the Antinomians.

At the same time, some in the emerging Christian communities began to prize the celibate state higher than marriage, taking the model of Jesus as a guide. This was related to a widespread belief about the imminent coming of the Kingdom of God; and thus the exhortation by Jesus to avoid earthly ties. The apostle Paul in his letters also suggested a preference for celibacy, but recognized that not all Christians necessarily had the ability to live such a life: &quot;Now as a concession, not a command, I say this. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion&quot;. This teaching suggested that marriage be used only as a last resort by those Christians who found it too difficult to exercise a level of self-control and remain abstinent, not having the gift of celibacy. Armstrong has argued that to a significant degree, early Christians &quot;placed less value on the family&quot; and saw celibacy and freedom from family ties as a preferable state for those capable of it. Nevertheless, this is tempered by other scholars who state Paul would no more impose celibacy than insist on marriage. What people instinctively choose manifests God&#x27;s gift. Thus, he takes for granted that the married are not called to celibacy.

As the Church developed as an institution and came into contact with the Greek world, it reinforced the idea found in writers such as Plato and Aristotle that the celibate unmarried state was preferable and more holy than the married one. At the same time, it challenged some of the prevalent social norms such as the buying and selling of women into marriage, and defended the right of women to choose to remain unmarried virgins for the sake of Christ. The stories associated with the many virgin martyrs in the first few centuries of the Catholic Church often make it clear that they were martyred for their refusal to marry, not necessarily simply their belief in Christ.

The teaching on the superiority of virginity over marriage expressed by Paul was accepted by the early Church, as shown in the 2nd-century &quot;Shepherd of Hermas&quot;. Justin Martyr, writing in the middle of the 2nd century, boasted of the &quot;many men and women of sixty and seventy years of age who from their childhood have been the disciples of Christ, and have kept themselves uncorrupted&quot;. Virginity was praised by Cyprian (c. 200 – 258) and other prominent Christian figures and leaders. Philip Schaff admits that it cannot be denied that the later doctrine of the 16th century Council of Trent – &quot;that it is more blessed to remain virgin or celibate than to be joined in marriage&quot; – was the view that dominated the whole of the early Christian church. At the same time, the Church still discouraged anyone who would &quot;condemn marriage, or abominate and condemn a woman who is a believer and devout, and sleeps with her own husband, as though she could not enter the Kingdom [of heaven]&quot;.

For much of the history of the Catholic Church, no specific ritual was therefore prescribed for celebrating a marriage – at least not until the late medieval period: &quot;Marriage vows did not have to be exchanged in a church, nor was a priest&#x27;s presence required. A couple could exchange consent anywhere, anytime&quot;.

===Church Fathers===
Markus notes this impact on the early Christian attitude, particularly as Christian anxiety about sex intensified after 400: &quot;The superiority of virginity and sexual abstinence was generally taken for granted. But a dark undercurrent of hostility to sexuality and marriage became interwoven with the more benign attitudes towards the body. Attitudes diverged, and mainstream Christianity became infected with a pronounced streak of distrust towards bodily existence and sexuality. This permanent &#x27;encratite&#x27; tendency was given powerful impetus in the debates about Christian perfection at the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth centuries&quot;.

While the Church Fathers of the Latin or Catholic Church did not condemn marriage, they nevertheless taught a preference for celibacy and virginity.

Bishop Ignatius of Antioch, writing around 110 to Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna said, &quot;[I]t becomes both men and women who marry to form their union with the approval of the bishop, that their marriage may be according to God, and not after their own lust&quot;.

In his &quot;On Exhortation to Chastity&quot; Tertullian argued that a second marriage, after someone has been freed from the first by the death of a spouse, &quot;will have to be termed no other than a species of fornication&quot;. Claiming to find in the Book of Leviticus a prohibition of remarriage by the priests of the Old Law similar to that for Christian clergy in the Pauline pastoral epistles, he used it as an argument against remarrying even on the part of lay Christians, whom Christ made &quot;a kingdom, priests to his God and Father&quot;: &quot;If you are a digamist, do you baptize? If you are a digamist, do you offer? How much more capital (a crime) is it for a digamist laic to act as a priest, when the priest himself, if he turn digamist, is deprived of the power of acting the priest! &#x27;But to necessity&#x27;, you say, &#x27;indulgence is granted&#x27;. No necessity is excusable which is avoidable. In a word, shun to be found guilty of digamy, and you do not expose yourself to the necessity of administering what a digamist may not lawfully administer. God wills us all to be so conditioned, as to be ready at all times and places to undertake (the duties of) His sacraments&quot;.

In his earlier &quot;Ad uxorem&quot; also, Tertullian argued against second marriages, but said that, if one must remarry, it should be with a Christian. In other writings, he argued strongly against ideas like those he expressed in his &quot;On Exhortation to Chastity&quot;; and in his &quot;De Anima&quot; he explicitly stated that &quot;the married state is blessed, not cursed by God&quot;. Adhémar d&#x27;Alès has commented: &quot;Tertullian wrote a lot about marriage, and on no other subject has he contradicted himself as much&quot;.

Cyprian (c. 200 – 258), Bishop of Carthage, recommended in his &quot;Three Books of Testimonies against the Jews&quot; that Christians should not marry pagans.
Addressing consecrated virgins he wrote: &quot;The first decree commanded to increase and to multiply; the second enjoined continency. While the world is still rough and void, we are propagated by the fruitful begetting of numbers, and we increase to the enlargement of the human race. Now, when the world is filled and the earth supplied, they who can receive continency, living after the manner of eunuchs, are made eunuchs unto the kingdom. Nor does the Lord command this, but He exhorts it; nor does He impose the yoke of necessity, since the free choice of the will is left&quot;.

Jerome (c. 347 – 420) commenting on Paul&#x27;s letter to the Corinthians wrote: &quot;If &#x27;it is good for a man not to touch a woman&#x27;, then it is bad for him to touch one, for bad, and bad only, is the opposite of good. But, if though bad, it is made venial, then it is allowed to prevent something which would be worse than bad. ... Notice the Apostle&#x27;s carefulness. He does not say: &#x27;It is good not to have a wife&#x27;, but, &#x27;It is good for a man not to touch a woman&#x27;. ... I am not expounding the law as to husbands and wives, but discussing the general question of sexual intercourse – how in comparison with chastity and virginity, the life of angels, &#x27;It is good for a man not to touch a woman&#x27;&quot;. He also argued that marriage distracted from prayer, and so virginity was better: &quot;If we are to pray always, it follows that we must never be in the bondage of wedlock, for as often as I render my wife her due, I cannot pray. The difference, then, between marriage and virginity is as great as that between not sinning and doing well; nay rather, to speak less harshly, as great as between good and better&quot;. Regarding the clergy, he said: &quot;Now a priest must always offer sacrifices for the people: he must therefore always pray. And if he must always pray, he must always be released from the duties of marriage&quot;. In referring to Genesis chapter 2, he further argued that, &quot;while Scripture on the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days relates that, having finished the works of each, &quot;God saw that it was good&quot;, on the second day it omitted this altogether, leaving us to understand that two is not a good number because it destroys unity, and prefigures the marriage compact&quot;. Jerome reaffirmed (&quot;God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth&quot;) and (&quot;Marriage is honourable in all&quot;), and distanced himself from the disparagement of marriage by Marcion and Manichaeus, and from Tatian, who thought all sexual intercourse, even in marriage, to be impure.

There were, of course, counter-views. Pelagius thought Jerome showed bitter hostility to marriage akin to Manichaean dualism, an accusation that Jerome attempted to rebut in his &quot;Adversus Jovinianum&quot;: &quot;We do not follow the views of Marcion and Manichaeus, and disparage marriage; nor, deceived by the error of Tatian, the leader of the Encratites, do we think all intercourse impure; he condemns and rejects not only marriage but also food which God created for the use of man. We know that in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware. [...] While we honour marriage we prefer virginity which is the offspring of marriage. Will silver cease to be silver, if gold is more precious than silver?&quot; Elsewhere he explained: &quot;Someone may say: &#x27;And do you dare disparage marriage, which is blessed by the Lord?&#x27; It is not disparaging marriage when virginity is preferred to it. No one compares evil with good. Let married women glory too, since they come second to virgins. &quot;Increase&quot;, He says, &quot;and multiply, and fill the earth&quot;. Let him who is to fill the earth increase and multiply. Your company is in heaven&quot;. Mocking a monk who accused him of condemning marriage, Jerome wrote: &quot;He must hear at least the echo of my cry, &#x27;I do not condemn marriage&#x27;, &#x27;I do not condemn wedlock&#x27;. Indeed — and this I say to make my meaning quite clear to him — I should like every one to take a wife who, because they get frightened in the night, cannot manage to sleep alone&quot;.

It was Augustine (354–430), whose views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology, that was most influential in developing a theology of the sacramentality of Christian marriage. In his youth, Augustine had also been a follower of Manichaeism, but after his conversion to Christianity he rejected the Manichaean condemnation of marriage and reproduction for imprisoning spiritual light within material darkness. He subsequently went on to teach that marriage is not evil, but good, even if it is not at the level of choosing virginity: &quot;Marriage and fornication are not two evils, whereof the second is worse: but marriage and continence are two goods, whereof the second is better&quot;.

In his &quot;On the Good of Marriage&quot;, of 401, he distinguished three values in marriage: fidelity, which is more than sexual; offspring, which &quot;entails the acceptance of children in love, their nurturance in affection, and their upbringing in the Christian religion; and sacrament, in that its indissolubility is a sign of the eternal unity of the blessed. Like the other Church Fathers of East and West, Augustine taught that virginity is a higher way of life, although it is not given to everyone to live at that higher level. In his &quot;De bono coniugali&quot; (On the Good of Marriage), he wrote: &quot;I know what people are murmuring: &#x27;Suppose&#x27;, they remark, &#x27;that everyone sought to abstain from all intercourse? How would the human race survive?&#x27; I only wish that this was everyone&#x27;s concern so long as it was uttered in charity, &#x27;from a pure heart, a good conscience, and faith unfeigned&#x27;; then the city of God would be filled much more speedily, and the end of the world would be hastened&quot;. Armstrong sees this as an apocalyptic dimension in Augustine&#x27;s teaching. Reynolds says that Augustine&#x27;s comment on this wildly hypothetical objection by Jovinian may have been that the saintliness of a church in which all had chosen celibacy would mean that it comprised enough members to fill God&#x27;s city or that the church would thereby gather souls to herself even more rapidly than she was already doing. Nevertheless, Augustine&#x27;s name &quot;could, indeed, be invoked through the medieval centuries to reinforce the exaltation of virginity at the expense of marriage and to curtail the role of sexuality even within Christian marriage&quot;.

Finally, Isidore of Seville (c. 560 – 636) refined and broadened Augustine&#x27;s formulation and was part of the chain by which it was transmitted to the Middle Ages.

Although not a church father, but belonging to the same period, in Adomnan of Iona&#x27;s biography of St Columba, the saint at one point is mentioned as meeting a woman who refuses to sleep with her husband and perform her marriage duties. When Columba meets the woman, she says that she would do anything, even to go to a monastery and become a nun, rather than to sleep with him. Columba tells the woman that the commandment of God is for her to sleep with her husband and not to leave the marriage to be a nun, because once they are married the two have become one flesh.

===Medieval period===

====Sacramental development====

The medieval Christian church, taking the lead of Augustine, developed the sacramental understanding of matrimony. However, even at this stage the Catholic Church did not consider the sacraments equal in importance. Marriage has never been considered either to be one of the sacraments of Christian initiation (Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist) or of those that confer a character (Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Orders).
With the development of sacramental theology, marriage was included in the select seven to which the term &quot;sacrament&quot; was applied. Explicit classification of marriage in this way came in reaction to the contrary teaching of Catharism that marriage and procreation are evil: the first official declaration that marriage is a sacrament was made at the 1184 Synod of Verona as part of a condemnation of the Cathars. In 1208, Pope Innocent III required members of another religious movement, that of the Waldensians, to recognize that marriage is a sacrament as a condition for being received back into the Catholic Church. In 1254, Catholics accused Waldensians of condemning the sacrament of marriage, &quot;saying that married persons sin mortally if they come together without the hope of offspring&quot;. The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 had already stated in response to the teaching of the Cathars: &quot;For not only virgins and the continent but also married persons find favour with God by right faith and good actions and deserve to attain to eternal blessedness&quot;. Marriage was also included in the list of the seven sacraments at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274 as part of the profession of faith required of Michael VIII Palaiologos. The sacraments of marriage and holy orders were distinguished as sacraments that aim at the &quot;increase of the Church&quot; from the other five sacraments, which are intended for the spiritual perfection of individuals. The Council of Florence in 1439 again recognised marriage as a sacrament.

The medieval view of the sacramentality of marriage has been described as follows: &quot;Like the other sacraments, medieval writers argued marriage was an instrument of sanctification, a channel of grace that caused God&#x27;s gracious gifts and blessings to be poured upon humanity. Marriage sanctified the Christian couple by allowing them to comply with God&#x27;s law for marriage and by providing them with an ideal model of marriage in Christ the bridegroom, who took the church as his bride and accorded it highest love, devotion, and sacrifice, even to the point of death&quot;.

====Liturgical practice====
Matrimony, for most of Church history, had been celebrated (as in traditions such as the Roman and Judaic) without clergy and was done according to local customs. The first available written detailed account of a Christian wedding in the West dates only from the 9th century and appears to be identical to the old nuptial service of Ancient Rome. However, early witnesses to the practice of intervention by the clergy in the marriage of early Christians include Tertullian, who speaks of Christians &quot;requesting marriage&quot; from them, and Ignatius of Antioch, who said Christians should form their union with the approval of the bishop – although the absence of clergy placed no bar, and there is no suggestion that the recommendation was widely adopted.

In the 4th century in the Eastern Church it was the custom in some areas for marriages to receive a blessing by a priest to ensure fertility. There are also a few accounts of religious nuptial services from the 7th century onward. However, while in the East the priest was seen as ministering the sacrament, in the West it was the two parties to the marriage (if baptized) who effectively ministered, and their concordant word was sufficient proof of the existence of a sacramental marriage, whose validity required neither the presence of witnesses nor observance of the law of the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council that demanded publication of the banns of marriage.

Thus, with few local exceptions, until in some cases long after the Council of Trent, marriages in Europe were by mutual consent, declaration of intention to marry and upon the subsequent physical union of the parties. The couple would promise verbally to each other that they would be married to each other; the presence of a priest or witnesses was not required. This promise was known as the &quot;verbum&quot;. If freely given and made in the present tense (e.g., &quot;I marry you&quot;), it was unquestionably binding; if made in the future tense (&quot;I will marry you&quot;), it would constitute a betrothal. One of the functions of churches from the Middle Ages was to register marriages, which was not obligatory. There was no state involvement in marriage and personal status, with these issues being adjudicated in ecclesiastical courts. During the Middle Ages marriages were arranged, sometimes as early as birth, and these early pledges to marry were often used to ensure treaties between different royal families, nobles, and heirs of fiefdoms. The church resisted these imposed unions, and increased the number of causes for the nullification of these arrangements. As Christianity spread during the Roman period and the Middle Ages, the idea of free choice in selecting marriage partners increased and spread with it.

The validity of such marriages even if celebrated under a tree or in a tavern or in a bed was upheld even against that of a later marriage in a church. Even after the Council of Trent made the presence of the parish priest or his delegate and of at least two more witnesses a condition for validity, the previous situation continued in many countries where its decree was not promulgated. It ended only in 1908, with the coming into force of the decree.

In the 12th century, Pope Alexander III decreed that what made a marriage was the free mutual consent by the spouses themselves, not a decision by their parents or guardians. After that, clandestine marriages or youthful elopements began to proliferate, with the result that ecclesiastical courts had to decide which of a series of marriages that a man was accused of celebrating was the first and therefore the valid one. Though &quot;detested and forbidden&quot; by the Church, they were acknowledged to be valid. Similarly today, Catholics are forbidden to enter mixed marriages without permission from an authority of the Church, but if someone does enter such a marriage without permission, the marriage is reckoned to be valid, provided the other conditions are fulfilled, although illicit.

===Counter-Reformation===

In the 16th century, various groups adhering to the Protestant Reformation rejected to different degrees the sacramental nature of most Catholic sacraments. In reaction, the Council of Trent on 3 March 1547 carefully named and defined the Catholic Church&#x27;s sacraments, reaffirming the teaching that marriage is a sacrament − from 1184, 1208, 1274 and 1439. Recalling scripture, the apostolic traditions and the declarations of previous councils and of the Church Fathers, the bishops declared that there were precisely seven sacraments, with marriage one of them, and that all seven are truly and properly sacraments.

Desiderius Erasmus influenced the debate in the first part of the 16th century by publishing 1518 an essay in praise of marriage (&quot;Encomium matrimonii&quot;), which argued that the single state was &quot;a barren way of life hardly becoming to a man&quot;. The theologian Josse Clichtove working at the University of Paris interpreted this as an attack on chastity, but Erasmus had found favor with Protestant reformers who acknowledged the argument as a useful tool to undermine compulsory clerical celibacy and monasticism.
Diarmaid MacCulloch argued that the action taken at Trent was therefore partly a response by Roman Catholicism to demonstrate that it was as serious about marriage and the family as the Protestants.

On 11 November 1563, the Council of Trent condemned the view that &quot;the marriage state is to be placed above the state of virginity, or of celibacy, and that it is not better and more blessed to remain in virginity, or in celibacy, than to be united in matrimony&quot;. And while Catholics upheld the supernatural character of marriage, it was Protestants who viewed it as not a sacrament and who admitted divorce.

The decree &quot;Tametsi&quot; of 1563 was one of the last decisions made at Trent. The decree effectively sought to impose the Church&#x27;s control over the process of marriage by laying down as strict conditions as possible for what constituted a marriage. John P. Beal says the Council, &quot;stung by the Protestant reformers&#x27; castigation of the Catholic Church&#x27;s failure to extirpate clandestine marriages&quot;, issued the decree &quot;to safeguard against invalid marriages and abuses in clandestine marriages&quot;, which had become &quot;the scourge of Europe&quot;. In 1215 the Fourth Lateran Council had prohibited marriages entered into clandestinely but, unless there was some other impediment, considered them valid though illicit. &quot;Tametsi&quot; made it a requirement even for validity, in any area where the decree was officially published, that the marriage take place in the presence of the parish priest and at least two witnesses. This revolutionised earlier practice in that &quot;marriages that failed to meet these requirements would from the time of the promulgation of the decree be considered invalid and of no effect&quot;; and it required that the priest keep written records, with the result that parents had more control over their children&#x27;s marriages than before. It also instituted controls over the marriages of persons without fixed addresses (&quot;vagrants are to be married with caution&quot;), &quot;regulated the times at which marriages could be celebrated, abolished the rule that sexual intercourse created affinity, and reiterated the ban on concubinage&quot;.

For fear that the decree would &quot;identify and multiply the number of doubtful marriages, particularly in Protestant areas, where &#x27;mixed&#x27; marriages were common&quot;, the council hesitated to impose it outright and decided to make its application dependent on local promulgation. In fact, &quot;Tametsi&quot; was never proclaimed worldwide. It had no effect in France, England, Scotland and many other countries and in 1907 was replaced by the decree &quot;Ne Temere&quot;, which came into effect universally at Easter 1908.

== Validity of marriage in the Catholic Church ==

The Catholic Church also has requirements before Catholics can be considered validly married in the eyes of the Church. A valid Catholic marriage results from four elements: (1) the spouses are free to marry; (2) they freely exchange their consent; (3) in consenting to marry, they have the intention to marry for life, to be faithful to one another and be open to children; and (4) their consent is given in the canonical form, i.e., in the presence of two witnesses and before a properly authorized church minister. Exceptions to the last requirement must be approved by church authority. The Church provides classes several months before marriage to help the participants inform their consent. During or before this time, the would-be spouses are confirmed if they have not previously received confirmation and it can be done without grave inconvenience (Canon 1065).

The Catholic Church also recognizes as sacramental, (1) the marriages between two baptized Protestants or between two baptized Orthodox Christians, as well as (2) marriages between baptized non-Catholic Christians and Catholic Christians, although in the latter case, consent from the diocesan bishop must be obtained, with this termed &quot;permission to enter into a mixed marriage&quot;. To illustrate (1), for example, &quot;if two Lutherans marry in the Lutheran Church in the presence of a Lutheran minister, the Catholic Church recognizes this as a valid sacrament of marriage&quot;. On the other hand, although the Catholic Church recognizes marriages between two non-Christians or those between a Catholic Christian and a non-Christian, these are not considered to be sacramental, and in the latter case, the Catholic Christian must seek permission from his/her bishop for the marriage to occur; this permission is known as &quot;dispensation from disparity of cult&quot;. The Church prefers that marriages between Catholics, or between Catholics and other Christians, be celebrated in the parish church of one of the spouses. Those helping to prepare the couple for marriage can assist with the permission process. In present-day circumstances, with communities no longer so homogeneous religiously, authorization is more easily granted than in earlier centuries.

=== Canonical form ===

The canonical form of marriage began to be required with the decree &quot;Tametsi&quot; issued by the Council of Trent on 11 November 1563. The decree &quot;Ne Temere&quot; of Pope Pius X in 1907 made the canonical form a requirement even where the decree of the Council of Trent had not been promulgated.

While allowing for exceptions, the canonical form of marriage, as laid down in Canons 1055–1165 of the &quot;1983 Code of Canon Law&quot; and Canons 776-866 of the &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot;, normally recognizes marriages of Catholics as valid only if contracted before the local bishop or a parish priest delegated by the bishop or (in the Latin Church only) a deacon delegated by them, and also at least two witnesses. In earlier times, validity was not made dependent on the fulfillment of these two conditions.

==== Freedom to marry ====
The participants in a marriage contract must have the freedom to marry. That is, there must be no impediment according to canon law.

==== Impediments ====

A Catholic marriage cannot be formed if one or more of the following impediments are present, although for some of these a dispensation can be given:
* Antecedent and perpetual impotence, whether on the part of the man or the woman
* Consanguinity to the fourth degree in the collateral line (first cousin), including legal adoption to the second collateral line
* Affinityrelationship by marriage, e.g. a mother-in-law, in the direct line
* Prior bondthe bond of a previous marriage
* Those in sacred orders
* Public and perpetual vow of chastity in a religious institute
* Disparity of cultone of the persons was baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it, and the other is not baptized
* Crimenone party previously conspiring to marry upon the condition of the death of their spouse while still married; also called &quot;conjugicide&quot;.
* The minimum age for entering into a valid marriage has not yet been reached (14 for women, 16 for men)
* Abduction

==== Times of year for celebrating a marriage ====
In the Latin Church, marriage may be celebrated during Lent even within a Nuptial Mass; however, it is considered inappropriate to have such a celebration during Holy Week and impossible during the Easter Triduum. In principle, no day of the week is excluded from marriage. Some Eastern Catholic Churches do not allow marriage during Lent. In earlier times, while the Latin Church allowed marriage to be celebrated at any time, it prohibited the solemn blessing of marriages during Advent and on Christmas Day, and during Lent and on Easter Sunday.

=== Mixed marriages ===

While marriage between a Catholic and any non-Catholic is commonly spoken of as a mixed marriage, in the strict sense a mixed marriage is one between a Catholic (baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it) and a non-Catholic &quot;Christian&quot;, known in popular parlance as an &quot;interdenominational marriage&quot;.

The Catholic Church has from the start opposed marriage between a Catholic and any non-Catholic, baptized or not, seeing it as &quot;degrading the holy character of matrimony, involving as it did a communion in sacred things with those outside the fold. [...] it was but natural and logical for the Church to do all in her power to hinder her children from contracting marriage with those outside her pale, who did not recognize the sacramental character of the union on which they were entering&quot;. The Church thus saw as obstacles to a Catholic&#x27;s marriage what came to be called the two impediments of mixed religion (in Latin, &quot;mixta religio&quot;) and of difference of worship (in Latin &quot;disparitas cultus&quot;).

==== Marriage with a non-Catholic Christian ====

From an early stage, Church councils forbade Catholic Christians to marry heretics or schismatics. Unlike marriage with a non-Christian, which came to be considered invalid, marriage with a heretic was seen as valid, though illicit unless a dispensation had been obtained. However, the Church&#x27;s opposition to such unions is very ancient. Early regional councils, such as the 4th-century Council of Elvira and the Council of Laodicea, legislated against them; and the ecumenical Council of Chalcedon prohibited such unions especially between members of the lower ecclesiastical grades and heretical women.

In 692, the Council in Trullo declared such marriages invalid, a decision accepted in the East, but not in the West.

With the Reformation in the 16th century, more legislation regarding mixed marriages was passed. In those countries where the Council of Trent&#x27;s &quot;Tametsi&quot; decree was promulgated, mixed marriages began to be viewed as invalid in the West, not directly because of being mixed, but because a condition for validity imposed by the decree was not observed, namely, that marriages be contracted before the parish priest or a priest delegated by him and at least two witnesses. This decree required the contract to be entered into before the parish priest or some other priest delegated by him, and in the presence of two or three witnesses under penalty of invalidity. Even where the &quot;Tametsi&quot; decree had been promulgated, the Church did not find it possible to insist on the rigour of this legislation in all countries, owing to strong Protestant opposition. However, the legislation was frequently enforced by Catholic parents stipulating in their wills that their children be disinherited if they renounced Catholicism.

Pope Benedict XIV issued a declaration (the &quot;Benedictine dispensation&quot;) concerning marriages in the Netherlands and Belgium (1741), in which he declared mixed unions to be valid, provided they were according to the civil laws. A similar declaration was made concerning mixed marriages in Ireland by Pope Pius, in 1785, and gradually the &quot;Benedictine dispensation&quot; was extended to various localities. Pius VI allowed mixed marriages in Austria to take place in the presence of a priest, provided no religious solemnity was employed, and with the omission of public banns, as evidence of the unwillingness of the Church to sanction such unions. In 1869, the Congregation of the Propaganda further permitted such marriages but only under the condition of grave necessity, fearing the faithful &quot;expose themselves to the grave dangers inherent in these unions&quot;. Bishops were to warn Catholics against such marriages and not to grant dispensations for them except for weighty reasons and not at the mere will of the petitioner. In countries where the decree was not promulgated, marriages otherwise contracted, called clandestine marriages, continued to be considered valid until the decree was replaced in 1908 by the decree &quot;Ne Temere&quot; of Pope Pius X, which revoked the &quot;Benedictine dispensation&quot;.

Catholic Christians are permitted to marry validly baptized non-Catholic Christians if they receive permission to do so from a &quot;competent authority&quot; who is usually the Catholic Christian party&#x27;s local ordinary; if the proper conditions are fulfilled, such a marriage entered into is seen as valid and also, since it is a marriage between baptized persons, it is a sacrament. 

Weddings in which both parties are Catholic Christians are ordinarily held in a Catholic church, while weddings in which one party is a Catholic Christian and the other party is a non-Catholic Christian can be held in a Catholic church or a non-Catholic Christian church.

A condition for granting permission to marry a non-Catholic is that the Catholic Christian party undertake to remove dangers of defecting from the faith and to do all in his or her power so that all the children are baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church; the other party is to be made aware of this undertaking and obligation of the Catholic Christian party.

==== Marriage with a non-Christian ====

The early Church did not consider invalid a Catholic&#x27;s marriage with a non-Christian (someone not baptized), especially when the marriage had taken place before the Catholic&#x27;s conversion to the faith. It was nevertheless hoped that the converted wife or husband would be the means of bringing the other party into the Church, or at least safeguarding the Catholic upbringing of the children of the union. With the growth of the Church, the need for such unions diminished and the objection to them grew stronger. More by custom than by church legislation, such marriages gradually came to be considered invalid and &quot;disparitas cultus&quot; came to be seen as an impediment to marriage by a Catholic. There were also enactments on a local level against marriages with pagans (Council of Carthage (397), and under Stephen I of Hungary in the early 11th century) and with Jews (Third Council of Toledo in 589).

When the Decretum of Gratian was published in the 12th century, this impediment became part of canon law. From that time forward, all marriages contracted between Catholics and non-Christians were held to be invalid unless a dispensation had been obtained from the ecclesiastical authority. 

A marriage between a Catholic and a non-Christian (someone not baptized) is seen by the Church as invalid unless a dispensation (called a dispensation from &quot;disparity of cult&quot;, meaning a difference of worship) is granted from the law declaring such marriages invalid. This dispensation can only be granted under certain conditions. If the dispensation is granted, the Church recognizes the marriage as valid, but natural rather than sacramental, since the sacraments can be validly received only by the baptized, and the non-Christian person is not baptized.

=== Matrimonial Consent ===
According to Canon 1057 of the Code of Canon Law (1983), marriage is established through the consent of the parties legitimately manifested between persons who are capable, according to the law, of giving consent. 

Consent, which no human power can replace, is the efficient cause of marriage. It is defined by Canon 1057.1 as an act of the will by which a man and a woman through an irrevocable personal covenant mutually give and accept each other for the purpose of establishing marriage. 

Such consent, however, must be manifested in a legitimate manner, that is, in a manner that has been determined by the Church in the formal solemnities prescribed for the validity of marriage (the canonical form). 

The persons manifesting their consent must be capable of doing that according to the law. 

===Remarriage of widows or widowers===

The teaching of the Catholic Church is that a married couple commits themselves totally to one another until death. The vows they make to each other in the wedding rite are a commitment &quot;til death do us part&quot;. After the death of one, the other is free to marry again or to remain single. Some choose to become priests or religious. This path was chosen by some even in the early Christian centuries by people such as Saint Marcella, Saint Paula, Saint Galla of Rome and Saint Olympias the Deaconess.

== Ministers of matrimony ==

=== Western Church ===
The husband and wife must validly execute the marriage contract. In the Latin Catholic tradition, it is the spouses who are understood to confer marriage on each other. The spouses, as ministers of grace, naturally confer upon each other the sacrament of matrimony, expressing their consent before the church.

This does not eliminate the need for church involvement in the marriage; under normal circumstances, canon law requires for validity the attendance of the local bishop or parish priest (or a priest or deacon delegated by either of them) and at least two witnesses. The priest has merely the role to &quot;assist&quot; the spouses in order to ensure that the marriage is contracted in accord with canon law, and is supposed to attend whenever it is possible. A competent layperson may be delegated by the Church, or may just attend in place of the priest, if it is impractical to have a priest attending. In the event that no competent layperson is found, the marriage is valid even if done in the presence of two witnesses alone. For example, in May 2017, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments granted a bishop&#x27;s request that a nun be granted permission to officiate at a marriage ceremony in Quebec because of a shortage of priests.

=== Eastern Churches ===
Eastern Catholic churches share the tradition common throughout Eastern Christianity, according to which the minister of the sacrament is the bishop or priest who &quot;crowns the bridegroom and the bride as a sign of the marriage covenant&quot;, a ceremony that has led to the rite being called the Mystery of Crowning.

== Indissolubility ==
Catholic theology teaches that a validly contracted sacramental marriage is accompanied by divine ratification, creating a virtually indissoluble union until the couple consummate, after which the sacramental marriage is dissoluble only by the death of a spouse. An unconsummated marriage can be dissolved by the Pope, as Vicar of Christ.

In the eyes of the Church, even validly contracted natural marriages (marriages in which at least one of the parties is not baptized) cannot be dissolved by the will of the couple or by any action of the state. Accordingly, &quot;the Catholic Church does not recognize or endorse civil divorce of a natural marriage, as of a sacramental marriage&quot;. However, a natural marriage, even if consummated, can be dissolved by the Church when to do so favours the maintenance of the faith on the part of a Christian, cases of what has been called Pauline privilege and Petrine privilege. In these cases, which require intervention by the Holy See, the Church admits real divorce, the actual dissolution of a valid marriage, as distinct from the granting by merely human power of a divorce that, according to Catholic theology, does not really dissolve the marriage bond.

While the violation of some regulations may make a marriage illicit, but not invalid, some conditions are essential and their absence means that there is in fact no valid marriage, and the participants are considered not to be actually married. However, Canon 1137 states that children born to a &quot;putative&quot; marriage (defined in Canon 1061, sec. 3 as one that is not valid but was entered into in good faith by at least one spouse) are legitimate; therefore, the declaration that a marriage is null does not render the children of that marriage illegitimate.

=== Annulments ===
The Catholic Church has consistently taken the position that, while the dissolution of a valid natural marriage, even if consummated, may be granted for the sake of someone&#x27;s Christian faith (&quot;in favorem fidei&quot;), though not for other reasons, and that a valid sacramental marriage, if not consummated, may be dissolved, a valid sacramental consummated marriage is indissoluble. There is no divorce from such a marriage. However, what is referred to as a marriage annulment occurs when two competent ecclesiastical tribunals hand down concordant judgments that a particular marriage was not in fact a valid one.

Requirements for the validity of marriage are listed in the Code of Canon Law under the headings &quot;Diriment Impediments&quot; (such as being too young, being impotent, being already married, being ordained), &quot;Matrimonial Consent&quot; (which requires, for instance, sufficient use of reason, psychic ability to assume the essential obligations of marriage, and freedom from force and fear), and &quot;The Form of the Celebration of Marriage&quot; (normally requiring that it be contracted in the presence of the parish priest or his delegate and at least two other witnesses).

An annulment is a declaration that the marriage was invalid (or null) at the time the vows were exchanged. Thus, an annulment is declared only when an ecclesial tribunal finds a lack of validity in the marriage at the time of the marital contract. Behaviour subsequent to the contract is not directly relevant, except as &quot;post factum&quot; evidence of the validity or invalidity of the contract. That is, behaviour subsequent to the contract cannot actually change the validity of the contract. For example, a marriage would be invalid if one of the parties, at the time of marriage, did not intend to honour the vow of fidelity. If the spouse did intend to be faithful at the time of the marriage but later committed adultery this does not invalidate the marriage.

The teaching of the Catholic church is that annulment and divorce therefore differ, both in rationale and effect; an annulment is a finding that a true marriage never existed, whereas a divorce is a dissolution of marriage.

In canon law there are numerous reasons for granting annulments of marriages that were entered into invalidly. MacCulloch has noted the &quot;ingenuity&quot; of Roman Catholic lawyers in deploying these in the historical context.

Annulments are not restricted to marriages. A similar process can lead to the annulment of an ordination.

== Sins against marriage and conjugal chastity ==
The teaching of the Catholic Church is that marriage may only be between one man and one woman with each partner&#x27;s free and willing consent for the good of each other and for the transmission of human life. The church believes adultery, divorce, remarriage after divorce, marriage without the intent to transmit life, polygamy, incest, child abuse, free union, and trial marriage are sins against the dignity of marriage. The church also believes that chastity must be practiced by spouses, and that sins against chastity include lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution, rape, incest, child abuse, and homosexuality in any shape or form. 

The Catholic Church opposes the introduction of both civil and religious same-sex marriage. The Church also holds that same-sex unions are an unfavourable environment for children and that the legalization of such unions damages society.
Leading figures in the Catholic hierarchy, including cardinals and bishops, have publicly voiced or actively opposed legislation of civil same-sex marriage and encouraged others to do the same, and have done likewise with regard to same-sex civil unions and adoption by same-sex couples.

There are a growing number of Catholics globally who dissent from the official position of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and express support for civil unions or same-sex marriage. In some locations, for example North America, Northern and Western Europe, there is stronger support for LGBT rights (such as civil unions, civil same-sex marriage and protection against discrimination) among Catholics than the general population at large.

In 2021, the Catholic Church reaffirmed its position: That &quot;the Church does not have the power to give the blessing to unions of persons the same sex&quot;. In 2023 the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith clarified that individual sinners may be blessed in non-liturgical settings that do not confuse the simple blessing with sacramental marriage in a decree called Fiducia Supplicans.

<doc id="395674" wikidata="Q39718" url="?curid=395674" title="Bob Kerrey">
<text>Joseph Robert Kerrey (born August 27, 1943) is an American politician who served as the 35th governor of Nebraska from 1983 to 1987 and as a United States Senator from Nebraska from 1989 to 2001.

Before entering politics, he served in the Vietnam War, as a United States Navy SEAL officer and was awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery in combat. During the action for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor, he was severely wounded, precluding further naval service. He later faced controversy for being the commanding officer during the Thanh Phong raid, where numerous civilians were killed.

Kerrey was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. He retired from the Senate in 2000 and was replaced by former governor and fellow Democrat Ben Nelson. From 2001 to 2010, he served as president of The New School, a university in New York City. In May 2010, he was selected to become the head of the Motion Picture Association of America. The MPAA, however, could not reach an agreement with him and chose former Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd instead. In 2012, Kerrey sought election to his old Senate seat to succeed his successor, the retiring Democratic incumbent Ben Nelson. He lost to Republican nominee Deb Fischer.

In 2013, Kerrey joined the Carmen Group lobbying firm. Kerrey is a co-chair for the advisory board of Issue One, an organization that describes its mission as &quot;fighting for real solutions to the problem of money in politics&quot;. In 1987, Kerrey was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board.

==Early life and education==
Kerrey was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on August 27, 1943, the son of Elinor Fern (née Gonder), a University of Nebraska instructor, and James Henry Kerrey, a builder and businessman. He attended the public schools of Lincoln and graduated from Lincoln Northeast High School in 1961. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 1966. Kerrey pledged Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and during his senior year he was admitted into the Society of Innocents, the chancellor&#x27;s senior honorary society of spirit boosters.

==Military service==
Kerrey served in the United States Navy as a SEAL officer during the Vietnam War. He completed Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1967. He then received assignment to Naval Amphibious Base Coronado and subsequently completed Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training with class 42 in December 1967. He received direct assignment to SEAL Team ONE, a separate organization from the Underwater Demolition Teams to which new personnel were normally assigned. After extensive pre-deployment training, Kerrey deployed to the Republic of Vietnam as assistant platoon commander with Delta Platoon, SEAL Team ONE in January 1969.

Kerrey was seriously wounded and lost the lower part of his right leg in combat on Hon Tre island near Nha Trang Bay on March 14, 1969. While suffering shrapnel wounds and blood loss, Kerrey organized his squad in a counterattack that killed or captured enemy Viet Cong. He was later medically discharged from the US Navy due to his wounds. On May 14, 1970, President Richard Nixon awarded Kerrey the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions.

===Medal of Honor citation===
His Medal of Honor citation reads:


===Thanh Phong raid===

In 2001, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; and &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; carried reports on an incident that occurred during Kerrey&#x27;s Vietnam War service. On February 25, 1969, he led a Swift Boat raid on the isolated peasant village of Thanh Phong, Vietnam, targeting a Viet Cong leader who intelligence suggested would be present. The village was considered part of a free-fire zone by the U.S. military.

Kerrey&#x27;s SEAL team first encountered a villager&#x27;s hut. Later, according to Kerrey, the team was &quot;shot at&quot; from the village and returned fire, only to find after the battle that some of the killed appeared to be children. &quot;The thing that I will remember until the day I die, is walking in and finding, I don&#x27;t know, 14 or so, I don&#x27;t even know what the number was, women and children who were dead&quot;, Kerrey said in 1998. &quot;I was expecting to find Viet Cong soldiers with weapons, dead. Instead I found women and children.&quot; Kerrey denied personally participating in the operation, but admitted to his own complicity. 

Gerhard Klann, a member of Kerrey&#x27;s SEAL team, gave a different version. According to Klann, the team rounded up civilians and decided to &quot;kill them and get out of there&quot;, for fear that they would alert enemy soldiers. He said that Kerrey gave the order. Kerrey responded to Klann&#x27;s account by stating &quot;it&#x27;s not my memory of it&quot;. Another witness, Pham Tri Lanh, said she hid in a banana grove as the soldiers entered the village. She says she witnessed the soldiers kill five civilians. Another survivor, Bui Thi Luom, was twelve at the time of the attack. She says seven men entered their hut of sixteen civilians, including five of her relatives, and killed the occupants with gunfire and an explosive device. She was the only survivor.

Kerrey expressed anguish and guilt over the events of that night, saying: &quot;You can never, can never get away from it. It darkens your day. I thought dying for your country was the worst thing that could happen to you, and I don&#x27;t think it is. I think killing for your country can be a lot worse. Because that&#x27;s the memory that haunts.&quot;

In a speech to ROTC candidates at Virginia Military Institute in 2001, Kerrey acknowledged using &quot;lethal procedures when there was doubt.&quot; And admitted &quot;It was a tragedy, and I had ordered it,&quot; he said. &quot;Though it could be justified militarily, I could never make my own peace with what happened that night. I have been haunted by it for 32 years.&quot;

He was awarded a Bronze Star for the raid on Thanh Phong, after his unit had falsely reported all the dead civilians as enemy guerrillas. The citation for the medal reads, &quot;The net result of his patrol was 21 Viet Cong killed, two hooches [huts] destroyed and two enemy weapons captured.&quot;

A display at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City is based on the incident. It includes several photos and a drain pipe, which it describes as the place where three children hid before they were found and killed.

==Business career==
After his military service, Kerrey pursued a business career. From 1972 to 1982, he owned and operated Grandmother&#x27;s Inc. a chain of restaurants known as Grandmother&#x27;s Skillet. Another company, Kerrey Holdings, included several fitness centers and a bowling alley. After he ceded active management to his brother-in-law in 1983, the businesses grew to include 10 restaurants, three fitness centers, a bowling alley, and other enterprises. Kerrey&#x27;s other ventures included trading in cattle futures and a partnership that invested in commercial real estate including shopping centers.

While engaged in his business career, Kerrey gained his initial political experience. These activities included working on a 1971 voter registration drive with anti-war activist Allard K. Lowenstein. Kerrey also managed a friend&#x27;s successful campaign for a seat in the state legislature. In addition, he served as a member of the city of Lincoln&#x27;s Human Rights Commission.

==Governor of Nebraska==

In 1982, Kerrey ran for Governor of Nebraska; he easily won the Democratic nomination 71 percent to 29 over state senator George &quot;Bill&quot; Burrows, then achieved a narrow victory over incumbent Republican Charles Thone, 51% to 49%. He served as one term, 1983 to 1987, and did not run for reelection in 1986. During his governorship, Kerrey pursued policies including welfare reform, education reform, job training, and environmental conservation. Several of these programs became models for other states and the federal government.

In 1986, Kerrey served as chair of the Midwestern Governors Association. As governor, he was known for his transparency and criticism of &quot;politics as usual&quot; obfuscating and clichés. He was the subject of nationwide news coverage in July 1986, when he ordered the Nebraska State Patrol to halt a train after the federal government failed to notify him of a rail shipment of nuclear waste that would pass through Nebraska, and directed the Nebraska Army National Guard to park a tank on the tracks at the Kansas-Nebraska border to ensure that the train did not proceed. After Kerrey&#x27;s chief of staff and the head of the state patrol met with federal authorities in Kansas, the train was allowed to proceed, with representatives of the federal government agreeing to notify state officials of the dates, times and routes for similar trains in the future.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

====1988====

In 1988, Kerrey ran for the U.S. Senate seat held by recently appointed incumbent Republican David Karnes. He won the Democratic primary with 92% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Karnes 57% to 42%.

====1994====

Kerrey won re-election to a second term defeating businesswoman Jan Stoney 55% to 45%

====2012====

Kerrey ran again for his old Senate seat after the retirement of Incumbent Democratic Senator Ben Nelson in 2012, but was defeated by Republican candidate State Senator Deb Fischer.

===Tenure===

Senator Kerrey was a member of the Agriculture Committee and the Finance Committee, and was a member of the Appropriations Committee from 1989 to 1996. He also served as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee from 1995 to 1999. He was the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the 104th Congress before retiring in 2001.

Kerrey voted for the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act in 1999, defending his position against opposition by stating, &quot;The concerns that we will have a meltdown like 1929 are dramatically overblown&quot;. Most famously, Kerrey cast the deciding vote in favor of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1993 budget plan.

==9/11 Commission==

After his retirement from the Senate, Kerrey served on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, commonly known as the 9/11 Commission. The commission was created by Congressional legislation to investigate the circumstances of the attacks on September 11, 2001, and to provide recommendations of actions that could help prevent future similar attacks. It was a bipartisan commission of five Democrats and five Republicans. The commission issued its final report, the 9/11 Commission Report on July 22, 2004.

Kerrey criticized the 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture as &quot;unfair&quot; and &quot;partisan&quot;.

==1992 presidential election==
In September 1991, Kerrey announced his candidacy for the 1992 Democratic nomination for president. In a small field of five second-tier candidates devoid of an early frontrunner, Kerrey was seen as the early favorite. However, his performance on the campaign trail sometimes seemed lackluster, especially in comparison to that of Arkansas governor Bill Clinton.

Kerrey finished third in the New Hampshire primary in February 1992, despite spending heavily on television advertising. He briefly rebounded after winning the South Dakota primary but soon dropped out of the race after finishing fourth in the Colorado primary. Kerrey was on Clinton&#x27;s &quot;short list&quot; of vice presidential candidates, but Tennessee Senator Al Gore received the nod instead.

==The New School==

Kerrey served as President of The New School from 2001 to 2010. During this time he more than doubled the endowment, taking it from $94 million in 2001 to $206 million. He also secured substantial federal funding for the school. Both of these factors helped the New School accomplish major academic growth and expansion in the decade that Kerrey was president.

Kerrey presided over an ambitious program of academic development at the university. Under his leadership, the university launched numerous new academic programs, including several joint degree programs. Enrollment increased by 44% to over 10,200, and online course enrollment doubled. He also oversaw an increase in the size of the faculty. The number of full-time faculty members grew from 156 in 2001 to more than 372 in 2009. He also helped to establish the Faculty Senate, which allowed the school to set university-wide standards for promotion, hiring, and faculty evaluation. Additionally, tenure was instituted for all academic departments.

On April 14, 2005, Kerrey announced that the university was changing its name from &quot;New School University&quot; to &quot;The New School&quot;, and rebranding its eight divisions as specialized, separate entities serving different constituencies.

On April 17, 2005, a week after accepting a position as head of Democrats for Bloomberg in support of Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s re-election as Mayor of New York City, Kerrey publicly stated that he was considering running against Bloomberg in the 2005 New York City mayoral election. Three days after announcing his interest, Kerrey announced that he would not run for Mayor, focusing instead on his position as President of the New School.

On December 10, 2008, it was announced that Kerrey had received a vote of no confidence from the university&#x27;s senior faculty. This was perceived to have come as a response to his management style. The no-confidence vote was largely a symbolic gesture. The Board of Trustees offered their unanimous support for Kerrey at a meeting following the faculty vote.

On December 16, 2008, dozens of students took over the cafeteria in the 65 5th Avenue building; as the occupation continued, the group grew into hundreds of students from the New School, other New York City based universities, labor union members, and other supporters. Initially, the students stated that they would not leave the building unless several school officials resigned. Kerrey attempted to have a discussion with the students at the beginning of the occupation, but the students voted down that option. The occupation ended after 30 hours when the two parties accepted a treaty; Kerrey agreed to amnesty for the students involved in the occupation, more student space, and more student input in school investments and decision making.

Early in the morning of April 10, 2009, 19 students took over the 65 5th Avenue building, erecting an anarchist flag and demanding once again that Kerrey resign. A few hours later, about 20 police officers entered the building, arresting 22 students and ending the occupation after five hours.

In December 2012, the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; reported that in 2010, the year of his anticipated departure, his salary was more than $600,000, and his total take-home pay, including bonuses, deferred compensation and nontaxable benefits, was $3,047,703, making Kerrey the highest-paid private college president in the United States.

Kerrey&#x27;s time as president concluded on January 1, 2011. He was succeeded by David E. Van Zandt. Kerrey was then appointed President Emeritus.

==Fulbright University Vietnam controversy==
While visiting Vietnam in May 2016, then Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the United States had appointed Kerrey to be chairman of the Board of Trustees of Fulbright University Vietnam. This announcement unleashed a heated controversy, in view of Kerrey&#x27;s role as the person in charge of the Thanh Phong village massacre in 1969.

Outspoken Vietnamese critics of the appointment of Kerrey included Tôn Nữ Thị Ninh, a former ambassador to the European Union, who exclaimed: “the decision to appoint Bob Kerrey to be chairman of the board of the first American-style university in Vietnam strikes me as insensitive to the Vietnamese at best, and taking us for granted at worst.” and the award-winning Vietnamese-American author Viet Thanh Nguyen. On the other hand, Kerrey&#x27;s appointment was endorsed by Đinh La Thăng, who at that time was Communist Party Secretary of Ho Chi Minh City and a member of the Politburo, but in January 2018 was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 13 years in prison on corruption charges.

A critic Bao Anh Thai, a lawyer in Ho Chi Minh City, said that leading a university was not the proper place for a man with Kerrey’s war record. “Please tell me the name of any prestigious university in this world, where a killer in cold blood of women and children — which he admitted to it and he is not charged for it — could be the president!,” also pointing out Kerrey’s previous tenure as President of The New School. 

Nguyen Duc Hien, another critic and journalist at a legal newspaper, noted that Kerrey kept quiet about the atrocities in Thanh Phong for more than 30 years and only spoke publicly about it when journalists had exposed him and forced his hand. “After killing and lying, he should not represent knowledge and contributing the values of America in Vietnam!”

In May 2018, H. Kim Bottomly, former president of Wellesley College, was appointed to succeed Kerrey.

==Failed comeback bid==
On December 27, 2011, Political Wire reported that Ben Nelson, who had succeeded Kerrey in the Senate, would not seek re-election, and asserted that Kerrey was in talks with senior Democrats about the possibility of replacing him. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Kerrey would neither confirm nor deny the rumor. American Crossroads had been running advertisements critical of Kerrey&#x27;s potential Nebraska Senate run, focusing on the fact that Kerrey had been living in New York for the last ten years. Kerrey responded to the ads with an invitation for Karl Rove to eat at one of Kerrey&#x27;s restaurants in Nebraska, or to work out at one of his gyms that he owns in that state. On February 27, 2012, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Kerrey had earlier decided against a run, but that an aide had confirmed that he was now filing to seek election to his old Senate seat. He won the May 15 Democratic primary against four minor candidates. However, he was defeated on November 6 by Republican state senator Deb Fischer. in a landslide. Kerrey narrowly won the state&#x27;s two largest counties, Douglas and Lancaster—home to Omaha and Lincoln, respectively—but only won three other counties. His margin in Omaha and Lincoln was not nearly enough to overcome Fischer&#x27;s margin in the more rural parts of the state.

==Circinus==
Kerrey works closely as an advisor to Elliott Broidy&#x27;s firm Circinus, a paramilitary firm Broidy purchased in 2014 which has large contracts with the United Arab Emirates.

==Personal life==
While he was Governor of Nebraska, Kerrey dated actress Debra Winger while the latter was in Lincoln filming &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (part of which is set in Nebraska), which won the 1983 Oscar for Best Picture. When confronted with intense questioning by the press over the nature of the relationship, Kerrey famously replied; &quot;What can I sayshe swept me off my foot&quot;, alluding to the fact that the lower part of one of his legs was amputated because of injuries sustained in his Medal of Honor action in Vietnam.

Kerrey is friends with fellow Vietnam veteran Jim Webb. In 2006 he became involved in convincing Webb to run for the US Senate. Webb entered the Virginia Democratic Primary, and Kerrey volunteered to serve as Webb&#x27;s National Finance Chair. Webb went on to win the extremely close election in Virginia, defeating George Allen. Kerrey also endorsed and appeared at campaign events for Al Franken in his bid for the U.S. Senate in Minnesota.

<text>Crème caramel (), flan, caramel pudding, condensed milk pudding or caramel custard is a custard dessert with a layer of clear caramel sauce.

== History ==
Custard has a long documented history, but crème caramel or flan in its modern form, with soft caramel on top, and prepared and cooked using a bain-marie, is first documented in by Jean Baptiste Reboul published in 1897.

In the late 20th century, crème caramel was common in European restaurants. The food historian Alan Davidson speculates that this may have been because the dish could be prepared in bulk, in advance.

==Etymology==
In this context, &quot;crème&quot; in French means &#x27;custard&#x27;. The names (French) and (Spanish) allude to the custard being turned over to be served.

Both &quot;crème caramel&quot; (&quot;caramel cream&quot;) and &quot;flan&quot; are French names; however, &quot;flan&quot; has come to have different meanings in different regions.

In Spanish-speaking countries (and often in the United States), crème caramel is known as &quot;flan&quot;. This was originally a Spanish-language usage. However, in North America the word is now best known in Latin American contexts; the other meaning is less common. Elsewhere, including in Britain, the English word flan means a type of tart somewhat like a quiche.

The Modern English word &quot;flan&quot; comes from French &quot;flan&quot;, from Old French &#x27;, in turn from Medieval Latin &#x27;, derived from the Old High German &quot;&quot;, a sort of flat cake, probably from an Indo-European root for &#x27;flat&#x27; or &#x27;broad&#x27;.

== Preparation ==
Crème caramel is a variant of plain custard (crème) where sugar syrup cooked to caramel stage is poured into the mold before adding the custard base. It is usually cooked in a bain-marie on a stovetop or in the oven in a water bath. It is turned and served with the caramel sauce on top, hence the alternate French names or &quot;&quot;. The milk may be flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, or lemon peel. The resulting texture is gelatinous and creamy.

Turning out larger dishes requires care, as the custard easily splits. Larger dishes also require more care to avoid undercooking the interior or overcooking the exterior. Thus, crème caramel is often cooked and served in individual ramekins. The objective is to obtain a homogeneous and smooth cream on the surface of the &quot;crème caramel&quot; with a liquid caramel base. Cooking it in a bain-marie avoids burning the caramel.

===Imitations===
An imitation of crème caramel may be prepared from &quot;instant flan powder&quot;, which is thickened with agar or carrageenan rather than eggs. In some Latin American countries, the true custard version is known as &quot;milk flan&quot; (flan de leche) or even &quot;milk cheese&quot;, and the substitute version is known as just &quot;flan&quot;.

==Regional varieties==
=== Argentina and Uruguay ===

In Argentina and Uruguay, crème caramel is usually eaten with &quot;dulce de leche&quot;, whipped cream, or both (&quot;flan mixto&quot;).

=== Brazil and Venezuela ===
In Venezuela and Brazil, it is often made with condensed milk, milk, eggs, and caramelized sugar on top. The Venezuelan version is known as &quot;quesillo&quot; (&quot;small cheese&quot;) and in Brazil, a local version is known as &quot;pudim&quot;, specifically &quot;pudim de leite&quot; (&quot;milk pudding&quot;), though the traditional &quot;flan&quot; is also commercially available. Pudim can have variations of flavor, such as chocolate, coconut, paçoca (peanut candy), cheese, and others, condensed milk pudding being a base recipe.

=== Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand ===
In Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand crème caramel often made with condensed milk, milk, coconut milk (as alternative), coconut cream, eggs and caramelized sugar on top.

=== Caribbean ===
In many Caribbean countries, the inclusion of coconut, condensed milk and evaporated milk is widespread. The milk base may also be flavored with nuts and fruits.

=== Chile ===
In Chile, &quot;Leche asada&quot; or &#x27;roasted milk&#x27; is similar to Crème caramel because it is made with the same ingredients, but &quot;Leche asada&quot; has a less smooth texture and is baked directly, which creates a toasted layer on the surface. In Chile, it is often eaten with &quot;dulce de membrillo&quot; (quince jelly) or condensed milk.

=== Costa Rica ===
Flan in Costa Rica often features coconut or coffee (&quot;flan de café&quot;).

=== Croatia ===

In Croatia, &quot;rožata&quot;, &quot;rozata&quot;, &quot;rožada&quot; or &quot;rozada&quot; () is flavored with the Dubrovnik liqueur rozalin (rose liqueur), which gives the cake its characteristic aroma. It has a documented history stretching from medieval times. Modern variations include vanilla and other flavorings.

=== Cuba ===
Cuban flan (&quot;flan de Cuba&quot;) is made with the addition of egg whites and a cinnamon stick. A similar Cuban dish is &quot;Copa Lolita&quot;, a small caramel flan served with one or two scoops of vanilla ice cream. Other variations include coconut or rum raisin topping.

=== Dominican Republic ===
In the Dominican Republic, only egg yolks are used, mixed with vanilla, evaporated milk, and condensed milk. Coconut flan is known as &quot;quesillo&quot;.

=== France ===
Regional variations of crème caramel in France include:

* &quot;Crème Renversée à la Normande&quot;: This variation of crème caramel is specific to the Normandy region of France. It is made with the addition of Calvados, an apple brandy produced in Normandy, which gives the dessert a distinct apple flavor.
* &quot;Crème Caramel à la Bretonne&quot;: This variation hails from Brittany and is made with the addition of salted butter, which adds a savory element to the dessert. The salted butter caramelizes with the sugar to create a unique flavor profile.
* &quot;Crème Caramel à la Provençale&quot;: In the Provence region, crème caramel is often flavored with lavender or orange blossom water, giving it a floral and aromatic twist.
* &quot;Crème Caramel à la Parisienne&quot;: This variation is commonly found in Parisian restaurants and is typically made with whole milk and egg yolks for a rich and creamy texture. It is often served in individual portions or as a large version.

=== India ===
Caramel custard is popular, especially in the larger coastal cities, and in former Portuguese colonies such as Goa, Daman and Diu. Sometimes, masala chai is added on the side. It is a staple on restaurant menus in the beach resorts along India&#x27;s coasts and also prepared regularly in the home kitchens of the Anglo-Indian Goan, Malayali, Mangalorean and Parsi communities.

=== Japan ===
Packaged crème caramel is ubiquitous in Japanese convenience stores under the name (i.e., &quot;pudding&quot;), or &quot;custard pudding&quot;. The same kind of dessert is sold in convenience stores in Taiwan.

=== Malaysia ===

Caramel custard (locally knows as &quot;puding karamel&quot; or &quot;puding karamel kastard&quot;) is a very popular dessert in Malaysia. First introduced by the Portuguese in the 16th century and sold year-round today, this dessert is popular served in restaurants, cafes, hotels, and even Ramadan bazaars for breaking the fast.

=== Mexico ===
Crème caramel is extremely popular in Mexico, being made at home, found pre-made at grocery stores, served in restaurants, and even sold on the streets. A variation of the dish called &quot;Flan Napolitano&quot; is made in some parts of Mexico where cream cheese is added to create a creamier consistency, though it is not as popular or widespread. Flan&#x27;s popularity among Mexican-Americans helped the dish become popular in the United States. Another variation is &quot;Flan de Cajeta&quot;, which replaces the standard caramel with cajeta (milk caramel with a base of goat milk).
A popular Mexican dessert involving crème caramel is &quot;chocoflan&quot; (a portmanteau of its constituents), which is a layered Bundt cake-styled dessert made of chocolate cake and Crème caramel baked in a water bath. It also has the nickname &quot;impossible cake&quot; due to how it is prepared: despite the Crème caramel layer making up the top half in the final dessert, the chocolate cake batter is poured in the tin first. Its popularity has spread to other Latin American countries, such as Chile.

=== Peru ===
In Peru, &quot;crema volteada&quot; &#x27;flipped cream&#x27; may use condensed rather than regular milk. Fruit may also be added, such as lucuma, custard apple, soursop, or granadilla.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, crème caramel is known as &quot;leche flan&quot; (an anglicization of Spanish &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;milk flan&quot;), which is a heavier version of the Spanish dish, made with condensed milk and more egg yolks. Leche flan is usually steamed over an open flame or stove top in an oval-shaped tin mold known as &quot;llanera&quot; (also spelled &quot;lyanera&quot;, which is also used to make hardinera), although rarely it can also be cooked in an oven. Leche flan is a staple dessert in celebratory feasts.

An even heavier version, called &quot;tocino de cielo&quot; or &quot;tocino del cielo&quot; (Spanish for &quot;heaven&#x27;s bacon&quot;), is similar, but has significantly more egg yolks and sugar.

Leche flan is also commonly baked into pastries. The most common is the Filipino dessert flan cake or leche flan cake, a Filipino chiffon or sponge cake base () with a layer of leche flan on top. It can similarly be baked into steamed cupcakes known as &quot;puto mamón&quot;, a combination known as &quot;puto flan&quot;.

Leche flan is also commonly used as a topping for the shaved ice dessert &quot;halo-halo.&quot;

=== Portugal ===
Known as &quot;Pudim flan&quot;, it is made with milk, eggs, caramelized sugar, and vanilla. Variations include orange or lemon zest, cinnamon, pineapple, Port wine, or even bacon, as is the case with Pudim Abade de Priscos. It characteristically has a hole in the center.

=== Puerto Rico ===
Most Puerto Rican flans are based on eggs and milk. Egg white and egg yolks are beaten separately with sugar to achieve a light flan. The Puerto Rican dessert &quot;flancocho&quot; combines (cream cheese flan) with a cake base ().

===Spain===
In Spain, crème caramel is a typical dessert that is often homemade and is also sold in grocery stores and restaurants with many variations. The best known version is the typical (egg flan), but there are many other versions, such as &quot;flan de queso&quot;, &quot;flan de leche&quot;, &quot;flan de vainilla&quot;, etc. In the original version, the flan has a layer of caramelised sugar that is sometimes crystallised to make it hard.

=== Vietnam ===

Crème caramel was introduced by the French and is common in Vietnam. It is known as &quot;caramen&quot;, or &quot;kem caramel&quot; in northern Vietnam or &quot;bánh flan&quot; or &quot;kem flan&quot; in southern Vietnam. Variations include serving with black coffee poured on top, or browning the caramel past typical caramelization point to make a darker, more bitter &quot;burnt caramel&quot;.

<doc id="395683" wikidata="Q27321" url="?curid=395683" title="One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich">
<text>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (, ) is a short novel by the Russian writer and Nobel laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, first published in November 1962 in the Soviet literary magazine &quot;Novy Mir&quot; (&quot;New World&quot;). The story is set in a Soviet labor camp in the early 1950s and features the day of prisoner Ivan Denisovich Shukhov.

The book&#x27;s publication was an extraordinary event in Soviet literary history, since never before had an account of Stalinist repressions been openly distributed in the Soviet Union. &quot;Novy Mir&quot; editor Aleksandr Tvardovsky wrote a short introduction for the issue entitled &quot;Instead of a Foreword&quot;.

==Translations==
At least six English translations have been made, the first five from the censored text as published in the Soviet Union. Of those, Ralph Parker&#x27;s translation (New York: Dutton, 1963) was the first to be published, followed by Ronald Hingley and Max Hayward&#x27;s (New York: Praeger, 1963), Bela Von Block&#x27;s (New York: Lancer 1963), Thomas P. Whitney&#x27;s (New York: Fawcett, 1963), and Gillon Aitken&#x27;s (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1971).

The sixth translation, by H.T. Willetts (New York: Noonday/Farrar Straus Giroux, 1991), is the only one that is based on the canonical Russian text and the only one authorized by Solzhenitsyn. The English spelling of some character names differs slightly among the translations.

==Plot==
Ivan Denisovich Shukhov has been sentenced to a camp in the Soviet Gulag system. He was accused of becoming a spy after being captured briefly by the Germans as a prisoner of war during World War II. Although innocent, he is sentenced to ten years in a forced labor camp.

The day begins with Shukhov waking up feeling unwell. For arising late, he is forced to clean the guardhouse, but this is a comparatively minor punishment. When Shukhov is finally able to leave the guardhouse, he goes to the dispensary to report his illness. It is relatively late in the morning by this time, however, so the orderly is unable to exempt any more workers and Shukhov must work.

The rest of the novel deals mainly with Shukhov&#x27;s squad (the 104th, which has 24 members), their allegiance to the squad leader, and the work that the prisoners (&quot;zeks&quot;) do in hopes of getting extra food for their performance. For example, they are seen working at a brutal construction site where the cold freezes the mortar used for bricklaying if not applied quickly enough. Solzhenitsyn also details the methods used by the prisoners to survive; the whole camp lives by the rule of day-to-day survival.

Tyurin, the foreman of gang 104, is strict but kind, and the squad&#x27;s fondness for him becomes more evident as the book progresses. Though a morose man, he is liked because he understands the prisoners, talks to them, and helps them. Shukhov is one of the hardest workers in the squad, possessing versatile skills that are in great demand, and he is generally well-respected. Rations are meager – prisoners only receive them on the basis of how productive their work units are (or how productive the authorities think they have been) – but they are one of the few things that Shukhov lives for. He conserves the food that he receives and is always watchful for any item that he can hide and trade for food at a later date, or for favors and services he can do for prisoners that they will thank him for in small gifts of food.

At the end of the day, Shukhov is able to provide a few special services for Tsezar (Caesar), an intellectual who does office work instead of manual labor. Tsezar is most notable, however, for receiving packages of food from his family. Shukhov is able to get a small share of Tsezar&#x27;s packages by standing in lines for him. Shukhov reflects on his day, which was both productive and fortuitous for him. He did not get sick, his group had been assigned well paid work, he had filched a second ration of food at lunch, and he had smuggled into camp a small piece of metal he would fashion into a useful tool.

==Main characters==
The 104th is the labor-camp team to which protagonist Ivan Denisovich belongs. There are over 24 members, though the book describes the following characters the most thoroughly:
* (Иван Денисович Шухов), the protagonist of the novel. The reader is able to see Russian camp life through Shukhov&#x27;s eyes, and information is given through his thoughts, feelings, and actions. Although the title refers to the main character by his given name, Ivan, and patronymic name, Denisovich (son of Denis), the character is primarily referred to by his surname, Shukhov.
* (Алёшка), a Baptist. He believes that being imprisoned is something that he has earned, since it allows him to reflect more on God and Jesus. Alyoshka, surprisingly, is able to hide part of a Bible in the barracks. Shukhov responds to his beliefs by saying that he believes in God but not heaven or hell, nor in spending much time on the issue.
* (Гопчик), a young member of the squad who works hard and for whom Shukhov has fatherly feelings, as he reminds Shukhov of his dead son. Gopchik was imprisoned for taking food to Ukrainian ultranationalists. Shukhov believes that Gopchik has the knowledge and adjustment skills to advance far at the camp.
* (Андрей Прокофьевич Тюрин), the foreman/squad leader of the 104th. He has been in the camp for Tyurin likes Shukhov and gives him some of the better jobs, but he is also subject to the camp hierarchy; Tyurin must argue for better jobs and wages from the camp officers in order to please the squad, who then must work hard in order to please the camp officers and get more rations.
* (Фетюков), a member of the squad who has thrown away all of his dignity. He is particularly seen as a lowlife by Shukhov and the other camp members. He shamelessly scrounges for bits of food and tobacco.
* , or (Цезарь Маркович), an inmate who works in the camp office and has been given other special privileges; for example, his civilian fur hat was not confiscated by the Personal Property department. Tzesar is a film director who was imprisoned before he could finish his first feature film. Some discussions in the novel indicate that he holds formalist views in art, which were probably the reason for his imprisonment. A cultured man, Tzesar discusses film with Buynovsky. His somewhat higher class background assures him food parcels.
* (Буйновский) also called &quot;The Captain&quot;, a former Soviet Naval captain and a relative newcomer to the camp. Buynovsky was imprisoned after he received a gift from an admiral on a British cruiser on which he had served as a naval liaison. In the camp, Buynovsky has not yet learned to be submissive before the wardens.
* (Павло), a Ukrainian who serves as deputy foreman/squad leader and assists Tyurin in directing the 104th, especially when Tyurin is absent.
* , or (Иван Кильдигс), the leading worker of the 104th squad along with Shukhov, a Latvian by birth. He speaks Russian like a native, having learned it in his childhood. Kilgas is popular with the team for making jokes.
* (Сенька Клевшин), a member of the 104th who became deaf from intense fighting during World War II. He escaped from the Germans three times and was recaptured each time, ending up in the Buchenwald concentration camp.

==History==
&quot;One Day&quot; is a sparse, tersely written narrative of a single day of the ten-year labor camp imprisonment of a fictitious Soviet prisoner, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had first-hand experience in the Gulag system, having been imprisoned from 1945 to 1953 for writing derogatory comments in letters to friends about the conduct of the war by Joseph Stalin, whom he referred to by epithets such as &quot;the master&quot; and &quot;the boss&quot;. Drafts of stories found in Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s map case had been used to incriminate him (Frangsmyr, 1993). Solzhenitsyn claimed the prisoners wept when news of Stalin&#x27;s death reached them. He uses the epithet &quot;batka usaty&quot; () in his novel, which translates to &quot;Old Whiskers&quot; or &quot;Old Man Whiskers&quot;. This title was considered offensive and derogatory, but prisoners were free to call Stalin whatever they liked: &quot;Somebody in the room was bellowing: &#x27;Old Man Whiskers won&#x27;t ever let you go! He wouldn&#x27;t trust his own brother, let alone a bunch of cretins like you!&quot;

In 1957, after being released from the exile that followed his imprisonment, Solzhenitsyn began writing &quot;One Day&quot;. In 1962, he submitted his manuscript to &quot;Novy Mir&quot;, a Russian literary magazine. The editor, Aleksandr Tvardovsky, was so impressed with the detailed description of life in the labor camps that he submitted the manuscript to the Communist Party Central Committee for approval to publish it—until then Soviet writers had not been allowed to refer to the camps. From there it was sent to the de-Stalinist Nikita Khrushchev, who, despite the objections of some top party members, ultimately authorized its publication with some censorship of the text. After the novel was sent to the editor, Aleksandr Tvardovsky of &quot;Novy Mir&quot;, it was published in November 1962.

The labor camp featured in the book was one that Solzhenitsyn had served some time at, and was located in Karaganda in northern Kazakhstan.

==Reception and influence==
&quot;One Day&quot; was published in 1962 in &quot;Novy mir&quot; with the endorsement of CPSU First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, who praised the novella at the Party plenum. In 1964, it was a candidate for the Lenin Prize and evoked heated debates among the prize committee, but ultimately failed to win the nomination. It evoked heated debates among the Soviet reading public, as well. As Miriam Dobson notes: The &quot;Novyi mir&quot; mailbag contains letters from lawyers, teachers, party members, purge victims and their relatives, self-confessed thieves, prisoners, camp workers, pensioners, an army captain, a collective farmer, a worker in a chemical laboratory, and simply &quot;young people.&quot; These letters reflect a broad spectrum of opinion. On the one hand, jubilant readers lavished praise on Solzhenitsyn, [&quot;Novy mir&quot; editor] Aleksandr Tvardovskii, and all that seemed to truly promise a &quot;new world&quot;; on the other hand, skeptical voices remained convinced that the camps had been populated by inveterate enemies of the Soviet people. Yet in the extant corpus of citizens&#x27; letters, such stark positions appear relatively rare.Such open publicity was, however, short lived. In October 1964, Khrushchev was ousted and the themes of gulags was disallowed in the Soviet press. Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s later novels were published abroad and circulated within the Soviet Union illegally. In 1969, Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Soviet Writers&#x27; Union. In 1970, he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature. 

Solzhenitsyn was arrested, stripped of his Soviet citizenship, and exiled from the Soviet Union in 1974. Two days after his expulsion, Glavlit issued an order removing all his books from libraries&#x27; open stacks. Until Gorbachev&#x27;s perestroika allowed their re-publication, they circulated only illegally, as samizdat. Vitaly Korotich, the perestroika-era editor of the magazine Ogoniok wrote: &quot;The Soviet Union was destroyed by information – and this wave started from Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;One Day&quot;&quot;.

==Film==
A one-hour dramatization for television, made for NBC in 1963, starred Jason Robards Jr. in the title role and was broadcast on November 8, 1963. A 1970 film adaptation based on the novella starred British actor Tom Courtenay in the title role. Finland banned the film from public view, fearing that it could hurt external relations with its eastern neighbor.

<doc id="395688" wikidata="Q7838851" url="?curid=395688" title="Trestle desk">
<text>There are two kinds of trestle desk: as with trestle tables, some have trestles joined by one or more stretchers (and sometimes to the desktop), and some have free-standing trestles. They can be dismantled, with the desk top removed from the trestles, for storage or transport.

==Antique trestle desk (linked trestles)==

The antique trestle desk has linked trestles. It is usually very much like the writing table desk form, which offers a simple flat desktop surface with a few drawers underneath it. Unlike the writing table the trestle desk is supported by two legs instead of four, and the legs are designed to be dismantled easily in order to store or move the desk efficiently. More precisely, the two legs are two strong side supports which branch out in two feet each (for a total of four) at the bottom. These trestles are fastened together, and sometimes to the desktop, to make a rigid support.

Some antique trestle desks are fitted with small cubbyholes and nooks or small drawers at the extremity of the work surface, and thus resemble a bureau à gradin.


As with most antique desk forms, this trestle desk surface is usually 29 inches (73.7 cm) from the floor (suitable for handwriting).

==Modern trestle desk==

The modern trestle desk is not so much a desk form as a desk improvisation. In shape and manufacture it sometimes resembles certain variations of the antique field desk which was used by officers not too far from the battlefield. Basically, the modern trestle desk improv is a plank of wood set on two trestles.

It is eminently portable, and eminently practical, when care is taken to provide stable trestles. The advent of the cubicle desk created a market for independent desk elements of all kinds, such as short, rolling filing cabinets. These proved suitable for use under a trestle desk and encouraged improvisation.

In the United States, a desk or a table set on X-shaped trestles is sometimes called a sawbuck table.

<text>Paavo Järvi (; born 30 December 1962) is an Estonian-American conductor. He has been chief conductor of Zurich&#x27;s Tonhalle since 2020. 

==Early life==
Järvi was born in Tallinn, Estonia (then occupied by the Soviet Union), to Liilia Järvi and the Estonian conductor Neeme Järvi. His siblings, Kristjan Järvi and Maarika Järvi, are also musicians. After leaving Estonia in 1980, the family settled in the United States. Järvi studied privately with Leonid Grin in Philadelphia, at the Curtis Institute of Music with Max Rudolf and Otto-Werner Mueller, and at the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute with Leonard Bernstein.
==Career==
From 1994 to 1997, Järvi was principal conductor of the Malmö Symphony Orchestra. From 1995 to 1998, he shared the title of principal conductor of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra with Sir Andrew Davis. Järvi was music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra from 2001 to 2011. The orchestra made a number of recordings for the Telarc label during Järvi&#x27;s tenure. In May 2011, he was named the orchestra&#x27;s Music Director Laureate. Since 2004, he has been the Artistic Director of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen and an Artistic Advisor to the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra. In 2006, Järvi became the Principal Conductor of the Frankfurt Radio Symphony, and served in the post until 2014. In 2010, he became Music Director of the Orchestre de Paris, concluding his tenure in 2016, the same year in which he was named Artist of the Year by both &quot;Gramophone&quot; and &quot;Diapason&quot; magazines.
Järvi is the founder and artistic director of both the Pärnu Music Festival and the Estonian Festival Orchestra. Järvi first guest-conducted the Tonhalle Orchestra in 2009, and returned in December 2016. In May 2017, the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich announced the appointment of Järvi as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2019–2020 season, with an initial contract of five years. In December 2022, the orchestra announced an extension of Järvi&#x27;s contract as its chief conductor through the 2028-2029 season.

Outside of Europe, in June 2012, the NHK Symphony Orchestra announced the appointment of Järvi as its chief conductor, beginning in the 2015–2016 season, with an initial contract of three years, which was extended a further three years to 2021. In November 2019, the NHK Symphony announced an extension of his contract through August 2022, at which time he stood down as its chief conductor.

Järvi has recorded for such labels as RCA, Deutsche Grammophon, PENTATONE, Telarc, ECM, BIS and Virgin Records. His Virgin Classics recording of Sibelius Cantatas with the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra, Estonian National Male Choir and Ellerhein Girls Choir won a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Choral Performance&quot;.

==Personal life==
Järvi has two daughters, Lea and Ingrid, from his past marriage to the violinist Tatiana Berman. Järvi was featured in the documentary &quot;Maestro&quot;, directed by David Donnelly. He became an American citizen in 1985.

<doc id="395703" wikidata="Q3027443" url="?curid=395703" title="Legend of Diego Salcedo">
<text>Diego Salcedo (died 1511) was a semi-legendary Spanish conquistador who is said to have lived during the colonization of the Americas. According to legend, his death at the hands of the indigenous Taíno people ignited the Taíno rebellion of 1511.

==Salcedo&#x27;s death==
According to the story, Salcedo died in 1511, during a trip to Puerto Rico, when Taínos, under the command of Agüeybaná II (brother of the great Taino Cacique Agüeybaná) and the Cacique of Añasco, Urayoán, drowned him in the Río Grande de Añasco. Historically, two versions about how Salcedo was lured to his death have collided. Many books assert that the soldier had been told he&#x27;d be taken to a lake filled with Taíno women that he could have sex with, and, once there, he found not women, but men who then proceeded to drown him. The other version has Salcedo being offered a ride across a river by Taínos who carried him on their arms, and then drowned him and kept him for days, afraid he&#x27;d still be alive and waiting until they were certain he was dead.

A third, and most accepted version of Salcedo&#x27;s death says that the Tainos, fearing that the Spaniards might be gods, refrained from harming them. After suffering under the Spaniards for so long, the Tainos, by order of Agüeybaná, ambushed Salcedo as he was drinking water at the edge of a river. Fearing that Salcedo might resurrect after three days—based on their understanding of the Christian teachings wielded by Catholic priests—they sat around for three days waiting for Salcedo to come back from the dead, but all they saw was Salcedo&#x27;s body rotting due to the heat just as they would. At that moment the Tainos realized that these were no gods.

It was with Salcedo&#x27;s death that the Taínos were encouraged to declare war on the Spaniards in Puerto Rico. This led to the Taino rebellion of 1511. However, the Tainos were quickly defeated due to the Spaniards&#x27; better weaponry and war expertise. After the death of Agüeybaná II, the native warriors retracted and became disorganized. Agüeybaná II&#x27;s followers opted for engaging the Spaniards via guerilla tactics. Such guerilla warfare lasted for the next eight years, until 1519. A second round of raids erupted in 1513 when Ponce de Leon departed the island to explore Florida. The settlement of Caparra, the seat of the island government at that time, was sacked and burned by an alliance between Taínos and natives from the northeastern Antilles.

By 1520 the Taíno presence on the island had almost disappeared. A government census in 1530 reports the existence of only 1,148 Taínos remaining in Puerto Rico. However, oppressive conditions for the surviving Taíno continued. Many of those who stayed on the island soon died either due to cruel treatment or the smallpox epidemic, which attacked the island in 1519.

==Legend==
A local legend tells of a ghostly Taino woman, supposedly Salcedo&#x27;s lover, that still haunts the site of his drowning at Añasco. This belief is exemplified by a verse in the town&#x27;s anthem:

==Salcedo in popular culture==
Salcedo is referenced in a song of Puerto Rican rock band Fiel a la Vega. The song is titled &quot;El Asunto: Salcedo Sigue Siendo Mortal&quot; (The Issue: Salcedo is still a Mortal) and it makes a comparison between the Spaniards&#x27; rule in the island and the United States&#x27; invasion of 1898.

<text>Pad Thai, phat Thai, or phad Thai ( or ; , , ISO: &quot;p̄hạd thịy&quot;, , &#x27;Thai stir fry&#x27;), is a stir-fried rice noodle dish commonly served as a street food in Thailand as part of the country&#x27;s cuisine. Thailand&#x27;s national dish, it is typically made with rice noodles, shrimp, peanuts, scrambled egg, sugar and bean sprouts. The ingredients are fried in a wok.

==History==

Pad Thai was originally called &quot;Kuai Tiao Pad Thai&quot; but this was later shortened to simply Pad Thai. &quot;Kuai tiao&quot; () is a Thai borrowing of the Teochew word &quot;guê2 diao5&quot; (), a type of thick Chinese rice noodle also known as shahe fen. The word &quot;kuai tiao&quot; has cognates in several other Southeast Asian countries where Chinese immigrants settled; with &quot;kuyteav&quot; in Cambodia, &quot;hủ tiếu&quot; in Vietnam, and &quot;kway teow&quot; in Malaysia and Singapore being analogues. 

Although stir-fried rice noodles were introduced to Thailand from China centuries ago, the dish &quot;pad Thai&quot; was invented in the mid-20th century. Author Mark Padoongpatt maintains that pad Thai is &quot;...not this traditional, authentic, going back hundreds of years dish. It was actually created in the 1930s in Thailand. The dish was created because Thailand was focused on nation-building. So this dish was created using rice noodles and it was called Pad Thai as a way to galvanize nationalism.&quot;

Another explanation of pad Thai&#x27;s provenance holds that, during World War II, Thailand suffered a rice shortage due to the war and floods. To reduce domestic rice consumption, the Thai government under Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram promoted consumption of noodles instead. His government promoted rice noodles and helped to establish the identity of Thailand. As a result, a new noodle called &quot;sen chan pad Thai&quot; (named after Chanthaburi Province) was created. Pad Thai has since become one of Thailand&#x27;s national dishes.

Thai-American food writer Kasma Loha-unchit disputes the claim of a native Thai origin and suggests that pad Thai was actually invented by the Chinese immigrants themselves, because &quot;for a dish to be so named in its own country clearly suggests an origin that isn&#x27;t Thai&quot;. Noodle cookery in most Southeast Asian countries was introduced by the wave of immigrants from southern China settling in the region the past century. Loha-unchit states that the ethnic Chinese of Thailand were aware that &quot;Central Thai people were very fond of the combination of hot, sour, sweet and salty flavors, they added these to their stir-fried noodle dishes and gave it a fusion name, much like Western chefs today are naming their dishes Thai this or Thai that on their East-West menus.&quot; 

At least as early as 2001, the Thai government used pad Thai as a form of &quot;soft power,&quot; creating &quot;the Global Thai Restaurant Company, Ltd., in an effort to establish at least 3,000 Thai restaurants worldwide.&quot; The plan included numerous government agencies and resulted in nearly tripling the number of Thai restaurants globally in seventeen years. 

Pad Thai is listed at number five on a list of &quot;World&#x27;s 50 most delicious foods&quot; readers&#x27; poll compiled by CNN Go in 2011.

==Ingredients==

Pad Thai is made with rice noodles, which are stir fried with eggs and chopped firm tofu, flavored with tamarind juice, fish sauce, dried shrimp, garlic, shallots, and sometimes red chili pepper and palm sugar, and served with lime wedges and often crushed roasted peanuts. It may contain other vegetables like bean sprouts, garlic chives, preserved radish, and raw banana flowers. It may also contain fresh shrimp, crab, squid, or other fish or meat.

Many of the ingredients are provided on the side as condiments, such as red chili pepper, lime wedges, roasted peanuts, bean sprouts, garlic chives, and other miscellaneous fresh vegetables. Vegetarian versions may substitute soy sauce for the fish sauce and omit the shrimp entirely.

<text>Cuautitlán Izcalli () is a city and one of the 125 municipalities that make up the State of Mexico. Its municipal seat is Cuautitlán Izcalli. It is located in the Valley of Mexico area, and is part of the Metropolitan area of Mexico City. It borders to the north and northwest with Tepotzotlán, to the northeast and to the east with Cuautitlán, to the south with Tlalnepantla de Baz, to the southeast with Tultitlán, to the southwest with Atizapán de Zaragoza and to the west with the municipality of Nicolás Romero.

== Identity elements ==

=== Shield ===
It is formed by a red triangle, fragmented in the center of each of its sides and with rounded corners, which represents the conjunction of the municipalities of Cuautitlán, Tepotzotlán and Tultitlán; Inside the triangle, a white circle stands out with ramifications towards each of the sides that form it. Forming a single image, a letter «C», in green, and a letter «I», in black, appear integrated.

=== Glyph ===
The glyph is formed by a tree with a tooth open in the center of the trunk, and means &quot;abundance between the heads&quot;. The spindles or malacates with the cotton are the glyph that represented the goddess Tlazolteotl, protector of the weavers, and &quot;Izcalli&quot; is represented by the glyph &quot;calli&quot;, “house”.

==History==
There is proof that the place that the municipality occupies today has been important for more than two thousand years, when indigenous groups, including hunters nomadics and settled peoples, such as the teotihuacanos, the Toltecs, Chichimecas and Olmecs, occupied the territory. With the defeat and fall of Mexico-Tenochtitlan in 1521, the kingdom of Spain exercised its power in the newly conquered regions. Hernán Cortés entrusted the town of Cuautitlán to Alonso de Ávila and this, to his brother Gil González Dávila. During this time, Cuautitlán was one of the first places where the Franciscan friars taught their doctrine, because a nephew of Moctezuma Xocoyotzin, the &quot;Señor de Tenayuca&quot; (), reigned there.

In the period of the independence war, in order to control by the Spanish the participation of the “rebels” in the war, a proclamation was issued to the sub-delegate of Cuautitlán, offering the grace of pardon to all those who belonged to its jurisdiction and who participated in the movement. Already promulgated, in 1827, the Political Constitution of the Free and Sovereign State of Mexico, the Departmental Board decreed on December 23, 1837, that the department of Mexico be divided into 13 districts, of which the fourth was Cuautitlán.

In 1855, nine districts and 33 districts were delimited, and the fifth was named Tlalnepantla, made up of that locality, Cuautitlán, Tlalpan and Zumpango. The history and strategic location gave rise to the original towns of the municipality: Axotlán, San Juan Atlamica, La Aurora, Santa Bárbara Tlacatecpan, San José Huilango, San Lorenzo Riotenco, San Mateo Ixtacalco, San Martín Tepetlixpan, Santa María Tianguistengo, San Francisco Tepojaco, Santiago Tepalcapa, El Rosario, and San Sebastián Xhala.

To keep the workers close to the various factories that flourished in the city, especially in the town of La Aurora, 225 adobe or tepetate houses were built around the facilities known as rancherías. They had services such as: drinking water, drainage, bathrooms, a tienda de raya () called &quot;La Vizcaya&quot;, a school (they were provided with supplies such as notebooks, pencils, books), streets and passenger cars for their transportation. La Vizcaya was the first factory that existed in this direction of Cuautitlán and that shipped products by rail.

In 1965, Gonzalo Monroy Ortega, then municipal president of Cuautitlán, asked the local legislature to make the colony of &quot;La Aurora&quot; disappear to become part of the town of La Aurora, but this request was not answered positively, because the two towns are only separated by a canal. On April 1, 1961, La Vizcaya closed due to the competition that arose at that time with the production of products derived from petroleum, which reduced the sale and distribution of coastals of natural fibers.

On July 31, 1971, the then President of the Republic, Luis Echeverría Álvarez, laid the first stone of the city, located next to what is now the Parque de las Esculturas. Originally, Cuautitlán Izcalli was planned to be the first self-sufficient city in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, and for this, a large part of the territory of existing municipalities was taken, such as Cuautitlán, Tepotzotlán, Tultitlán and Atizapán de Zaragoza. Like many other projects of the time, one of the objectives of building this city was the regulation of population growth and the reduction of congestion in the metropolitan area. The city was created using the plans of European and American cities as a base, which helped to transform the land into appropriate areas for the establishment of work, service and housing centers, with the idea of having sports areas and industrial, residential and green areas.

On May 1, 1972, President Luis Echeverría, together with the then Governor of the State of Mexico Carlos Hank González, made the symbolic delivery of 225 houses, and also began to operate the first office of telegraphs of Cuautitlán Izcalli; but it was not until August 21 of the same year, when the keys to the first 227 houses were handed over to normal school teachers from the entity and the first “Conasuper” shopping center was inaugurated in the vicinity of Plaza Isidro Fabela, in Cumbria.

Decree Number 71 of the H. XLV Legislature of the State of Mexico, signed on June 22, 1973, stipulates that the official name of municipality number 121 of the State of Mexico is Cuautitlán Izcalli:

Once the official designation of the city was finalized, the first political administration of the municipality was headed by the lawyer Gabriel Marcelino Ezeta Moll, who began his activities with a limited budget that amounted to 3 million 103 thousand 166 pesos until the end of 1973. Serving in the role of ruler from 1973 to 1976, the first seats of government were established first in the &quot;Calmecac&quot; secondary school in Cumbria, then in four houses on Jocotitlán street, later in some offices installed in the upper part of a sub-commercial center located on Jilotzingo street, and Finally, it was not until 1976 that a government building was established that began to function as the municipal presidency. The headquarters was inaugurated by Luis Cuauhtémoc Riojas Guajardo, who was elected as the second municipal president of Izcalli after the end of the term of governance of Gabriel Marcelino.

=== Villages ===
Cuautitlán Izcalli was formed from 13 original villages:
== Geography ==
It has a territorial extension of 109.54 square kilometers, it represents 0.5% of the surface of the State of Mexico.

The highest portions are located to the south of the municipality at a maximum height of 2430 m s. n. m. (metros sobre el nivel del mar, English: meters above sea level) and the lowest is to the west with 2200 m s. n. m., the municipal seat is at 2280 m s. n. m.

=== Location and access ===
The municipality of Cuautitlán Izcalli is located in the northwestern part of the Mexico Basin. It has a territorial extension of 109,924 km2.

Its location is along the infrastructure chain formed by the Mexico-Querétaro highway, México-Pachuca, México-Puebla, Chamapa-Lechería, and Peñón-Texcoco, with which a large number of areas are connected conurbations through high-specification highways, and integrated in turn, towards the regions of Toluca, Puebla, Hidalgo and Querétaro. Izcalli is also connected to the Tren Suburbano.

It has four entrances: the entrance of Constitución avenue, Chalma avenue, Adolfo López Mateos avenue, México Cuautitlán avenue. The authorities of Cuautitlán Izcalli, in coordination with the government of the State of Mexico, built the James Watt bridge, which increased by 75 percent the capacity of vehicles at the entrance of the Mexico-Cuautitlán highway.

=== Hydrography ===

The principal water currents in Izcalli are the río Cuautitlán, which crosses an approximate extension of 40 km of the municipal territory, and the Hondo de Tepotzotlán River. The main bodies of water in the municipality are:

* Presa de Guadalupe ()
* Laguna de la Piedad ()
* Espejo de los Lirios ()
* Presa de Angulo ()
* Laguna de Axotlán ()

=== Lago de Guadalupe ===
El lago de Guadalupe () is a dam that was built between 1936 and 1943, for flood control and irrigation. It extends over 348 hectares, being 2,200 meters above sea level. It belongs to the basin of the Moctezuma River.

The dam is the second most important body of water in the Valley of Mexico, and is supplied by the Cuautitlán, Xinte and San Pedro rivers. Starting in 2006, as a result of the death of hundreds of fish between the months of May 2004 and February 2005, the Guadalupe Dam Basin Commission was created, with the aim of restoring the natural resources of this sub-basin, in addition to promoting sustainable development, having as its main axis this water resource.

=== Ecosystems ===

The municipality has a great variety of vegetation, mainly made up of forests and grasslands. The former occupy a land area of approximately 451 hectares. The main reason why the municipality has several green areas is because the initial construction lands were covered by several plains.

=== Natural areas ===
The Presa de Guadalupe () is a protected natural area which is shared with Nicolás Romero, a neighboring municipality of Izcalli. As it is a protected area with the category of state park, it falls under the exclusive jurisdiction and competence of the State of Mexico, for which reason it is managed by the Secretary of the Environment of the Government of the State of Mexico, through the Comisión Estatal de Parques Naturales y de la Fauna (CEPANAF), ().

Other green areas in the city include the Parque Espejo de los Lirios (), the Parque Central (), and the laguna de Axotlán (), a body of water belonging to the town of the same name dating from the year 1627. Although this lagoon is also considered a protected area, there have been several times in which businessmen have tried to dry it to be able to build, highlighting the attempts of 2002, 2010, 2014, and 2021.

== Economy ==
Shopping malls in the city include Centro San Miguel, San Marcos Power Center, and Luna Parc, which compete with Galerías Perinorte to the south of the municipality. Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Cuautitlán Assembly plant is based in Izcalli, assembling Fiestas (F-Series before 2010). Companies like Alpura and Becton Dickinson installed their industrial plants in this municipality.

== Culture ==
Some of the cultural centers and places that Izcalli has include:
* The Centro Regional de Cultura Cuautitlán Izcalli (), a cultural space managed by the Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura in which workshops are given on ballet, Mexican folk dance, theater, guitar, piano, children&#x27;s theater, singing, among other classes.
* The Plaza Estado de México (), inaugurated on April 20, 2013, in homage to the Mexican Army and the Mexican Air Force, it is located next to the Mexico-Querétaro Highway.
* The Parque de las Esculturas (), that offers an environment in nature, accompanied by the art of the sculptor Charlotte Yazbek.
* The Teatro San Benito Abad (), which belongs to the private school Centro Escolar del Lago (), has a capacity of 1,500 spectators.

<doc id="395725" wikidata="Q889604" url="?curid=395725" title="David Walters">
<text>David Lee Walters (born November 20, 1951) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 24th governor of Oklahoma from 1991 to 1995.

Born in Canute, Oklahoma, Walters was a project manager for Governor David Boren and the youngest executive officer working for the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. He also worked in commercial real estate. As governor, he increased education funding, but his term was marred by controversies that ended with him pleading guilty to a misdemeanor election violation. He did not seek re-election and was defeated in a 2002 campaign for the United States Senate. He is the CEO of Walters Power International, a global provider of local power.

==Early life==
Walters was born near Canute, Oklahoma, and graduated as valedictorian from Canute High School in 1969. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in industrial engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1973 and a master&#x27;s degree in business administration from Harvard University in 1977.

He worked as the project manager for Governor David Boren and as the assistant and associate provost of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. At the age of 29, he was the youngest executive officer in the university’s history. In 1982, he joined The Burks Group, a commercial real estate company. He was appointed co-chairman of the governor&#x27;s 100-member Reform Commission in 1984 and became the president of American Fidelity Property Company in 1985.

==Governor of Oklahoma==
In 1986, Walters was the Democratic nominee for governor of Oklahoma, but was defeated by Republican Henry L. Bellmon, who returned to the governorship after completing his first term 20 years earlier.

On November 6, 1990 Walters was elected governor, carrying 75 of the state’s 77 counties. During his term education funding increased by approximately 30 percent and a $350 million bond issue for higher education brought construction and renovation to every state college campus.

Walters planned on making the Blue Room, a large ceremonial hall in the State Capitol, into his office.

While in office he was accused of election violations in that he conspired to hide $18,000 in campaign donations by attributing them to someone else. At the end of procedures, Governor Walters asked prosecutors what they wanted to end the rather lengthy process. An agreement was reached that the governor would plead guilty to a misdemeanor offense and pay a fine, in return for which his record would be expunged in twelve months. Though Walters claimed his innocence of the charges, he said it was in the best interest of the state and his family to accept the plea agreement. Twelve months later the charge was expunged from his record. He did not run for re-election in 1994, citing the pressure and negative publicity of political office, which he partly blamed for the suicide of his son in 1991.

<doc id="395726" wikidata="Q1545681" url="?curid=395726" title="Executive Council of Hong Kong">
<text>The Executive Council of Hong Kong (ExCo) is the cabinet of the Government of Hong Kong, acting as a formal body of advisers to the Chief Executive of Hong Kong that serves as a core policy-making organ assisting the chief executive. It is analogous to other Executive Councils in the Commonwealth such as the Federal Executive Council of Australia, the Executive Council of New Zealand, and the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

Under the presidency of the chief executive, the executive council consists of 21 Official Members (the most senior of these being the Chief Secretary of Hong Kong, head of the Government Secretariat and chair of the Policy Committee), and 16 Non-official Members (also known as ministers without portfolio who are normally leading legislators from pro-establishment political parties) headed by the Convenor of the Non-official Members. The Council normally meets once a week.

==History==
The executive council was set up by the British Hong Kong Government. The first &quot;ex officio&quot; members were the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer in the 1840s. The Attorney General was added in the 1850s. In 1949, the Executive Council had five &quot;ex officio&quot; members: the senior military officer (Commander of British Forces Overseas), the colonial secretary, the attorney general, the secretary for Chinese affairs and the financial secretary; the Commissioner of Labour, while an &#x27;official&#x27; was not an &quot;ex officio&quot; member. In addition, there were six &#x27;unofficial members&#x27;: the chief manager of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Tai-Pan of Jardine&#x27;s, a solicitor, two barristers, and a physician.

In 1994 the title &#x27;Senior Member&#x27; or &#x27;Senior Unofficial Member&#x27; was changed to &#x27;Convenor&#x27;, when Lydia Dunn was succeeded in the post by Rosanna Wong.

The format of the executive council was retained after the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 until a ministerial system (named Principal Officials Accountability System or POAS) was introduced in 2002, Tung Chee Hwa&#x27;s second term of office. Since then all secretaries are political appointees and have to leave the civil service. All secretaries are appointed to the council, transforming the council effectively into a cabinet. Non-official members are minorities in the council, and are like ministers-without-portfolio. The position of convenor was abolished.

In fulfilling his election platform, Chief Executive Sir Donald Tsang appointed eight new non-official members the day after delivering his first policy address on 12 October 2005. Secretaries of bureaux would sit in meetings of the Council when the agenda was related to their portfolio, and the position of convenor was restored. It was presented as a move to re-strengthen the role of the council as a link with the community.

===Change in composition===
==Functions==
The executive council is to advise the chief executive in policy-making and the administration of the government. The chief executive acting after consultation with the executive council is known as Chief Executive in Council.

Under Article 54 of the Basic Law, the chief executive must consult the executive council before making important policy decisions, introducing bills to the Legislative Council, making delegated legislation, regulating certain public institutions, or dissolving LegCo. The chief executive in council also hears appeals and objections under certain Ordinances. A Chief Executive rejecting a majority opinion of the Executive Council is required to put the specific reasons for the rejection on record.

==Composition==

The members of Executive Council are appointed by the Chief Executive from among principal officials (heads of department, informally called &quot;ministers&quot;), members of Legislative Council, and public figures. Their appointment and removal is decided by the chief executive. There is no fixed term of office, but the term of office of members cannot extend beyond the expiry of that of the chief executive who appoints them (Article 55 of the Basic Law).

The council is presided over by the Chief Executive. In addition to the 21 principal officials there are 16 Non-official members. Other than the Chief Secretary, Financial Secretary and Secretary for Justice, official members only sit in meetings that are related to their portfolio. In accordance with the Oaths and Declarations Ordinance, the members of the Executive Council should take the Oath of Fidelity after his/her appointment and promise not to reveal any matters being discussed in the council. The aim of this principle was to ensure that the members could speak freely without any fears and pressure, so as to facilitate the chief executive to receive prompt and objective advices in the policy making process.

The following list includes all members of the executive council in the order of precedence: 
*Note: To avoid confusion, all the names on this list follow the Hong Kong convention (English name &lt;if available&gt;, family name, Chinese given name &lt;if available&gt;) for consistency.

* 2012–2017: CY Leung as Chief Executive of Hong Kong
* 2017–2022: Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong

==Location==
The executive council meets in the Lower Block of the Central Government Complex, Tamar. Until 2012, ExCo met in the Main Wing of the Central Government Offices on Government Hill, in Central and below Government House (former residence of the British Governor of Hong Kong).

Prior to the Handover, the Provisional Executive Council of Hong Kong, headed by Tung Chee Hwa, met in Shenzhen or Tung&#x27;s office on the 11th floor of the Asia Pacific Finance Tower in Hong Kong. Members of the outgoing British Hong Kong ExCo were not permitted to attend this body.

Both Executive Council sittings were on Tuesdays.

<text>Marmora&#x27;s warbler (Curruca sarda) is a typical warbler in the &quot;Sylviidae&quot; family. The specific &quot;sarda&quot; is a Latin feminine form for a person from Sardinia.

==Taxonomy==
Marmora&#x27;s warbler was formerly described in 1820 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck under the binomial name &quot;Sylvia sarda&quot;. Temminck based his account on a manuscript by the Italian soldier and naturalist Alberto della Marmora that had been read at the Academy of Turin in August 1819. Marmora&#x27;s warbler is now one of 27 species placed in the genus &quot;Curruca&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1802. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds on Mediterranean islands, typically including Corsica and Sardinia. The smaller Balearic Islands bird is given specific status as Balearic warbler, &quot;Curruca balearica&quot;. These two seem to form a superspecies which in turn groups with Tristram&#x27;s warbler and the Dartford warbler. They are generally resident but some birds migrate south to winter in north Africa. They are rare vagrants to northern and western Europe. These small passerine birds are found in open country with thorny bushes and heather. 3-5 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush. Like most warblers, they are insectivorous.

==Description==
These are small, long tailed, large-headed birds, overall very similar to their close relatives in the Dartford warbler group. Marmora&#x27;s warblers are grey above and below, lacking the brick-red underparts of the Dartford warbler. Adult males have darker patches on the forehead and between the eye and the pointed bill. The legs and iris are red. The song is a fast rattle. Immature birds can be confused with young Dartford warblers, which are also grey below, but Marmora&#x27;s have a paler throat. Their iris is dark.

<doc id="395734" wikidata="Q1760073" url="?curid=395734" title="The Angels (American group)">
<text>The Angels were an American girl group best known for their 1963 No. 1 hit single &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot;.

The Angels originated in New Jersey as the Starlets, consisting of sisters Barbara &quot;Bibs&quot; and Phyllis &quot;Jiggs&quot; Allbut, Bernadette Carroll, and Lynda Malzone. They had local hits and worked as backup singers in the studio. Linda Jansen replaced Malzone as lead singer, and the group eventually changed their name to the Angels. In 1963, they signed with Mercury Records&#x27; subsidiary Smash Records and released their biggest hit, &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back,&quot; which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over one million copies. The group underwent several lineup changes and disputes over their name, resulting in a temporary rebranding as the Halos. In 2005, the Angels were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. As of 2021, Phyllis Allbut and Peggy Santiglia are the last remaining founding members of the group still alive.

== History ==
The group originated in New Jersey as the Starlets which consisted of sisters Barbara &quot;Bibs&quot; and Phyllis &quot;Jiggs&quot; Allbut, Bernadette Carroll, and Lynda Malzone. They had minor local hits and wound up doing back-up work in the studio. When Malzone left, Linda Jansen became the new lead singer. Their manager, Tom DeCillis, turned his focus to Bernadette Carroll and dropped the rest of the group. Carroll would find solo success in 1964 with her Laurie Records single &quot;Party Girl&quot;. After a failed attempt at a record deal with producer Gerry Granahan, the Allbut sisters turned their focus to education: Phyllis was in teacher&#x27;s college at the time and Barbara was accepted into the Juilliard School for her abilities as a musical arranger. Soon Granahan, who had previously rejected the group, saw hit potential in the song they had performed for him in their audition, a version of &quot;Till&quot;, and wanted them to record it in the studio. &quot;Till&quot; became their first single under their new name, the Angels, and also their first hit (No. 14 US) when it was released by Granahan&#x27;s Caprice label in 1962. The song was followed up with a second national hit, &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;. The Angels had one album on Caprice, titled &quot;...And the Angels Sing,&quot; in 1962.

Jansen left the group in late 1962 to go solo and was replaced by Peggy Santiglia, formerly of The Delicates (with Denise Ferri and Arleen Lanzotti). Santiglia had sung jingles for WINS Radio, appeared on Broadway, and had songwriting experience. In 1963, the trio signed to Mercury Records&#x27; subsidiary label Smash Records and began working with the Feldman-Goldstein-Gottehrer songwriting team, who wrote &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot;. The Angels&#x27; performance (with Santiglia on lead) was originally intended as a demo for The Shirelles&#x27; consideration, but the music publishers chose instead to release it as it stood. The song was a major hit, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The follow-up was the lower-charting &quot;I Adore Him&quot; (No. 25 US). The B-side &quot;Thank You And Goodnight&quot; charted at No. 84 US. During their Smash career, the Angels maintained a steady string of moderately successful singles which included &quot;Wow Wow Wee (He&#x27;s The Boy For Me)&quot; (No. 41 US). Their album &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back &quot; made the top forty, charting at No. 33. but their next, &quot;A Halo to You&quot;, did not chart. The group left Smash in 1964 and signed with Congress Records.

The group became the Halos, following a dispute over the ownership of the name &quot;the Angels&quot;. Peggy Santiglia took a leave of absence from the group in 1965 and was replaced by Toni Mason. The group released several more singles, none of which charted. Mason left the group in 1967 and was replaced by Debra Swisher (previously of The Pixies Three), who had recently recorded and released her own version of &quot;Thank You And Goodnight&quot; on the ABC-Paramount Records subsidiary, Boom Records. This lineup resumed using the name &quot;the Angels&quot; and released a handful of singles on RCA Records. Former Starlet Bernadette Carroll was back in the group and became the new lead. They appeared on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; before disbanding in 1968. Santiglia and Phyllis and Barbara Allbut regrouped in the early 1970s and released a new single on Polydor Records.

Phyllis Allbut and Santiglia continued to perform as the Angels, joined occasionally by Barbara Allbut.

In 2005, the Angels were inducted in the Vocal Group Hall of Fame.

Depicted by actresses, the Angels are shown singing &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot; in the 2014 film &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;, based on the Broadway hit musical about Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. Both groups originated in New Jersey.

On October 5, 2018, former member Bernadette Carroll died at the age of 74.

On February 19, 2019, the Angels&#x27; original lead singer Linda Jansen died at the age of 74.

On July 10, 2021, founding member Barbara &quot;Bibs&quot; Allbut Brown died at the age of 80, leaving her sister Phyllis and Peggy as the last remaining founding members of the group still alive.

He co-founded the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, and was the band&#x27;s guitarist, leader, primary composer, and sole continuous member for over five decades. He is considered one of the pioneers of heavy metal music and is responsible for inspiring numerous subgenres of metal, most notably doom metal. Iommi was ranked number 13 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2023 list of the “250 Greatest Guitarists of all Time.

On his last day of work in a sheet metal factory, as a teenager, Iommi lost the tips of the middle and ring fingers of his right hand in an accident, an event which crucially impacted his playing style. He briefly left Black Sabbath (then known as Earth) in 1968 to join Jethro Tull, but did not record any material with the band, and subsequently returned to Black Sabbath in 1969. In 2000, he released his first solo album &quot;Iommi&quot;, followed by 2005&#x27;s &quot;Fused&quot;, which featured his former bandmate Glenn Hughes. After releasing &quot;Fused&quot;, he formed Heaven &amp; Hell, which disbanded shortly after the death of Ronnie James Dio in 2010 (they toured on Black Sabbath songs when Dio was in the band but changed the name for legal reasons).

In 2011, Iommi published his autobiography, entitled &quot;Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath&quot;.

==Early life==
Iommi was born at Heathfield Road Maternity Hospital in Birmingham; he is the only child of Italian immigrants Sylvia Maria (née Valenti) from Palermo, Sicily, and Anthony Frank Iommi Sr. from Marche. Sylvia&#x27;s family were vineyard owners in Italy. The family was Catholic, though they rarely attended Mass. Their family home in the Park Lane area of Aston also housed a shop which was a popular meeting place in the neighbourhood, with the living room doubling as the shop&#x27;s stockroom. His mother ran the shop while his father was a carpenter by trade.

Born and raised in Handsworth, Birmingham, Iommi attended Birchfield Road School, where future bandmate Ozzy Osbourne was also a pupil one year behind him. At age 8 or 9, while being chased by another boy, Iommi fell and cut his upper lip. As a result, he gained the nickname &quot;Scarface&quot;, which made him self-conscious, so he eventually grew his trademark moustache as a means of covering the scar.

At about age 10, Iommi began working out and learned judo, karate, and later boxing as a means of protecting himself from the local gangs which congregated in his neighbourhood. He envisioned a future as a bouncer in a nightclub. Iommi initially wanted to play the drums, but due to the excessive noise he chose the guitar instead as a teenager, after being inspired by the likes of Hank Marvin and the Shadows. He has always played guitar left-handed. After completing school, Iommi worked briefly as a plumber and later in a factory manufacturing rings. He stated that at one point he worked in a music store, but quit after being falsely accused of stealing.

===Factory accident===
At the age of 17, Iommi lost the tips of the middle and ring fingers of his right hand (his fret-board hand, since he is left-handed) in an industrial accident on his last day of work in a sheet metal factory. Iommi described how he &quot;was told &#x27;you&#x27;ll never play again&#x27;. It was just unbelievable. I sat in the hospital with my hand in this bag and I thought, that&#x27;s it – I&#x27;m finished. But eventually I thought &#x27;I&#x27;m not going to accept that. There must be a way I can play&#x27;.&quot; After the injury, Iommi&#x27;s factory foreman played him a recording of famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, which encouraged him to continue as a musician. As Iommi later wrote:
Inspired by Reinhardt&#x27;s two-fingered guitar playing, Iommi decided to try playing guitar again, though the injury made it quite painful to do so. Although it was an option, Iommi never seriously considered switching hands and learning to play right-handed. In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, he was asked if he was &quot;ever tempted to switch to right-handed playing.&quot; Iommi responded:

To play left-handed, he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the thimbles were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle – &quot;melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger&quot; – and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic, which created two technical problems. First, the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to press down very hard on them. Second, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek light-gauge guitar strings to make it easier to do so. However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used banjo strings instead, until around 1970–71 when Picato Strings began making light-gauge guitar strings. Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos. In 1974, Iommi told &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine that the thimbles &quot;helped with his technique&quot; because he had to use his little finger more than he had before the accident. Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;, &quot;Lord of this World&quot;, and &quot;Into the Void&quot;, all on the album &quot;Master of Reality&quot;). Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a &quot;bigger, heavier sound&quot;, slackening the strings makes it easier to bend them.

Iommi reflected in 2016 saying that his greatest regret is losing his fingertips:

== Career ==

=== Pre-Black Sabbath ===
Iommi had played in several blues/rock bands, one of the earliest of which was the Rockin&#x27; Chevrolets from 1964 to 1965. The band had regular bookings. Iommi later joined The Birds And Bees, and when they were offered work in Germany, Iommi decided to leave his factory job to take up the opportunity. From 1966 to 1967, Iommi played in a band named the Rest. It was in the Rest that Iommi first met future-Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, who played drums and sang in the band.

From January until July 1968, Iommi was guitarist in Mythology, with Ward joining a month later in mid-February. In May 1968 police raided the group&#x27;s practice flat and found cannabis resin, which resulted in fines for the band members. Most significantly, the incident made it quite difficult for the band to secure future bookings as most club owners avoided bands they viewed as drug users. Mythology subsequently split up after a gig in Silloth on 13 July 1968.

In August 1968 at the same time as the break-up of Mythology, another Birmingham band called Rare Breed also broke up. Vocalist Ozzy Osbourne joined with Iommi and Ward after the duo responded to an advert in a local music shop proclaiming &quot;Ozzy Zig Requires Gig – has own PA&quot;. Requiring a bassist, Osbourne mentioned his former Rare Breed bandmate Geezer Butler, who was subsequently hired along with slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips and saxophonist Alan &quot;Aker&quot; Clarke. The six-piece band were named the Polka Tulk Blues Band. After just two gigs (the last of which was at the Banklands Youth Club in Workington), Phillips and Clarke were dismissed from the band, which soon after shortened its name to Polka Tulk.

=== Earth and Jethro Tull===

Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne renamed the band Earth in September 1968. The same month Iommi briefly departed to join Jethro Tull. However, after only two performances (an appearance on &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock &amp; Roll Circus&quot; in which the band mimed &quot;A Song for Jeffrey&quot; while Ian Anderson sang live, and a live appearance at BBC), Iommi was back with Earth in November 1968.

Concerning his brief working relationship with Jethro Tull vocalist Ian Anderson, Iommi said:
===Black Sabbath ===
In August 1969, after being confused with another group named Earth (who had minor success in England), the group renamed themselves Black Sabbath. His factory accident affected the Black Sabbath sound; Iommi had tuned down his guitar by 1971&#x27;s &quot;Master of Reality&quot; album, lowering string tension and easing the pain to his fingertips. Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler did the same to match Iommi. Sabbath was among the first bands to utilize lower tunings, and the technique became a mainstay of heavy metal music. Iommi combined blues-like guitar solos and dark, minor-key riffing with a revolutionary high-gain, heavily distorted tone with his use of power chords, a modified treble-boosting effect-pedal and a Gibson SG.
By the late 1970s, Black Sabbath were experiencing problematic substance use, managerial problems, and touring exhaustion. In addition, the band&#x27;s slow, blues-driven riffs were seen by some as outmoded against the rising generation of metal bands such as Judas Priest and Motörhead. After the albums &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; and &quot;Never Say Die!&quot; were not universally critically well received, Iommi and Butler decided that Sabbath needed a fresh start so, in the summer of 1979, they replaced Osbourne with Ronnie James Dio, the former vocalist for Rainbow. With Dio, Black Sabbath produced &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, an album that attempted to update Black Sabbath&#x27;s sound for the 1980s and include the soaring vocals that characterised the NWOBHM (New wave of British heavy metal) scene. Halfway through the 1980 tour, Bill Ward dropped out due to alcohol problems and displeasure with the direction that Dio was taking the band. He was replaced by Vinny Appice. With Iommi and Geezer Butler the only original members, this line-up produced &quot;Mob Rules&quot;. Dio quit the following year to begin a solo career, so Sabbath went through a revolving door line-up for the next decade with a succession of frontmen: Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen, and Tony Martin. After Ian Gillan (formerly of Deep Purple) departed the band in 1984, Geezer Butler left as well. With Sabbath in effective hiatus, Iommi recorded his first solo album, entitled &quot;Seventh Star&quot;. The album featured Glenn Hughes (also formerly of Deep Purple) on vocals, but due to label pressures, it was billed as a release by &quot;Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi&quot;.

In 1992, Iommi appeared at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, playing four songs with the remaining members of Queen and other guest artists. Geezer Butler also returned to Sabbath that year. In the following year Iommi teamed up with fellow Black Country band Diamond Head and co-wrote the song &quot;Starcrossed (Lovers in the Night)&quot; for their 1993 &quot;Death and Progress&quot; album. At Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;farewell&quot; concert at Costa Mesa in 1992, Dio refused to perform and abruptly left the band. As a result, Rob Halford was recruited to perform as the vocalist for two gigs (Halford also sang at one of the dates on the 2004 Ozzfest tour, when Osbourne couldn&#x27;t perform due to bronchitis). Following Osbourne&#x27;s solo set, the show concluded with the other members of the original Black Sabbath line-up joining for a 4-song reunion.

Black Sabbath went on to record two further albums with Tony Martin before the original line-up reunited as a touring band in 1997. While Bill Ward played at the two initial reunion shows at Birmingham NEC in December 1997, he was not present for the following two reunion tours, his second absence due to a heart attack. Ward was replaced by Mike Bordin and then Vinny Appice.

On 11 November 2011, Black Sabbath announced that they would be reuniting with the original line-up and would be recording a new album. Bill Ward did not participate and was eventually replaced by Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk for drum sessions. The new album, &quot;13&quot;, was released in June 2013. They disbanded at the conclusion of The End Tour in early 2017.

On 9 September 2022, Iommi was featured as a guitarist for two tracks on Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s album &quot;Patient Number 9&quot;. On 8 August 2022, Iommi reunited with Osbourne to play at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in their home city of Birmingham. They were joined by 2017 Black Sabbath touring musicians Tommy Clufetos and Adam Wakeman for a medley of &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot;. Iommi was also involved in the opening ceremony on 28 July 2022, where he played guitar on a song called &quot;Hear My Voice&quot; performed by British saxophonist and rapper Soweto Kinch.

=== Solo career ===

In 2000, Iommi released his first proper solo album, titled &quot;Iommi&quot;. The album featured several guest vocalists including Ian Astbury, Skin, Henry Rollins, Serj Tankian, Dave Grohl, Billy Corgan, Phil Anselmo, Peter Steele, and Osbourne. In late 2004 Iommi&#x27;s second solo album was released, entitled &quot;The 1996 DEP Sessions&quot;. This album was originally recorded in 1996 but was never officially released. However, a copy with a drum track by Dave Holland was available as a bootleg called &quot;Eighth Star&quot;. Glenn Hughes performed vocals on the album and he furthered his collaboration with Hughes with the release of his third solo album, &quot;Fused&quot;. Released on 12 July 2005, John Mellencamp drummer Kenny Aronoff completed the trio on the album.

Iommi has signed with Mike Fleiss&#x27;s movie production company Next Films to score a series of horror films entitled &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;.
Starting in 1989, Tony Iommi was involved in the Rock Aid Armenia project. In October 2009 Iommi and his colleague Ian Gillan were awarded the Orders of Honor – Armenia&#x27;s highest order, which were delivered to them by the Prime Minister of Armenia for their help after the Spitak earthquake. They formed the supergroup WhoCares and recorded a single called &quot;Out of my Mind&quot;, which was released 6 May 2011 for the benefit of the music school to be built in Gyumri, Armenia. In January 2012, when Iommi was announced to have stage 3 lymphoma, the Armenian Prime Minister sent a letter of support: &quot;We know your spirit is strong as ever, and we do believe the genius of your inspiration that guides you through the work on the new Black Sabbath album will transform into a boost of strength and energy that you need now, when things look tough&quot;.

Iommi made an appearance in 2020 on the track &quot;Astorolus—The Great Octopus&quot; by Candlemass, which received a Grammy nomination.

November 2021 saw a completely different side to Tony with the launch of a perfume in collaboration with Italian brand Xerjoff. As well as the scent, Tony created a track and video, his first instrumental single – &quot;Scent of Dark&quot;.

2022 brought appearances at both the opening and closing of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Tony duetted at the opening with Indigo Marshall and was joined by Ozzy for the closing song.

He featured on two songs from the Ozzy Osbourne album &quot;Patient Number 9&quot; – &quot;No Escape from Now&quot; and &quot;Degradation Rules&quot;, the latter winning the Best Metal Performance Grammy in February 2023.

2023 has seen collaboration with Birmingham&#x27;s Royal Ballet on &quot;Black Sabbath – The Ballet&quot;, which has proved to be a resounding success. His music from the first few Sabbath albums formed the bedrock that the complete music score was based on.  

A Sky Arts documentary, &quot;Greatest Guitar Riffs&quot;, aired in November 2023, featured Tony and many close friends including Brian May discussing his work.

Tony&#x27;s most recent solo release is the instrumental track &quot;Deified&quot;, revisiting his partnership with Xerjoff.

=== Heaven &amp; Hell ===
In October 2006 it was reported that Iommi would tour with Ronnie James Dio, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward again, but under the name &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot;. Later it was announced that Ward had decided not to participate and Vinny Appice was hired as his replacement. Rhino Records released &quot;The Dio Years&quot; (under the &#x27;Black Sabbath&#x27; moniker) album on 3 April 2007. The album showcased older tracks with Dio and also included three brand new songs recorded with Dio and Appice.

The band started an American tour in April 2007 with Megadeth and Down as opening acts. The tour finished in November in England with the prospect of an album to follow in 2008. During this period the band&#x27;s show at the New York Radio City Music Hall was released as both a live DVD and CD with a vinyl release in the UK in 2008. During the summer of 2008 the band embarked on the Metal Masters Tour along with Judas Priest, Motörhead and Testament. The band&#x27;s first and only studio album, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, was released on 28 April 2009.

In November 2008 Iommi had a star revealed on the Birmingham Walk of Stars. Dio died of stomach cancer in May 2010, and on 14 June 2010, Iommi announced that Heaven &amp; Hell would perform a one-off tribute to Ronnie James Dio at the High Voltage Festival, London on 24 July 2010. This was the band&#x27;s last performance under the name.

=== Eurovision Song Contest ===
Iommi wrote the song &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; which was sung by Dorians for Armenia in the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest.

==Personal life==
Iommi purchased his first house in Stafford, England, in 1972. He also purchased an adjacent property for his parents. Iommi has been married four times: 
*In late 1973, Iommi married Susan Snowden, to whom he had been introduced by Black Sabbath&#x27;s then-manager Patrick Meehan. The song &quot;Fluff&quot;, one of Iommi&#x27;s instrumental compositions later released on the &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; album, was played as Snowden walked down the aisle. Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham was Iommi&#x27;s best man for the ceremony. The marriage lasted for three years. Iommi said in a 1991 &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview that the troubled recording and mixing of Black Sabbath&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; contributed to the end of his marriage.
*Iommi married American model Melinda Diaz in 1980. They had a daughter, Toni-Marie Iommi, in 1983, who was the vocalist for the now-defunct band LunarMile. Iommi divorced Melinda in the mid-1980s. When Toni-Marie was 12 years old, Iommi won custody of her after she was placed in foster care. Toni-Marie has described her early childhood with a mentally unbalanced mother as difficult but says that her father finally &quot;saved her&quot;. She has stated that with her father she was able to regain her trust in other people. Mikko &quot;Linde&quot; Lindström, guitarist with Finnish band HIM, became engaged to Toni-Marie in August 2010. In 2013, the couple were reported to have broken up.
*In 1986–1987, Iommi met an English woman named Valery, and after a six-year relationship they married. She had a son from a previous relationship named Jay. They divorced in the late 90s. Iommi confirmed in the same &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview referenced above (a co-interview with Metallica&#x27;s James Hetfield) that he has a son. He told Hetfield regarding the band&#x27;s so-called &quot;Black Album&quot;, that &quot;my son gave me a copy of your latest album...&quot;. 
*In 2005, Iommi married Maria Sjöholm, formerly vocalist for Swedish alternative metal band Drain STH. They met around 1998, when Tony was working on music for Drain STH. After a year of talking on the phone, in 1999, Maria relocated to England and moved into Tony&#x27;s home. On 19 August 2005, without telling anyone, Maria and Tony married at the Sunset Marquis hotel. On page 312 of his book, Tony calls the low-key wedding the &quot;Best thing I ever did!&quot;

During the mid-1980s Iommi was briefly engaged to rock musician Lita Ford, formerly of The Runaways. Iommi co-produced her solo album &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot;, which to date remains unreleased. Ford herself has said that her involvement with him during that period was strictly personal and that he had no involvement in the half-finished album. She said in a 1989 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; interview that &quot;there&#x27;s a certain amount of bad blood between Tony and I.&quot;

On 19 November 2013, Iommi received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts degree from Coventry University. The honorary degree came &quot;in recognition of his contribution to the world of popular music&quot;, and recognised &quot;his role as one of the founding fathers of heavy metal music and his status as one of the industry&#x27;s most influential figures&quot;, the university said. Iommi is also a visiting professor of music at Coventry University.

Iommi holds dual British and Italian citizenship, acquiring the latter due to his parents.

=== Health ===
In early 2012, Iommi was diagnosed with the early stages of lymphoma, for which he underwent successful treatment. Black Sabbath&#x27;s 2013 tour dates were arranged so that Iommi was free to return to the UK once every six weeks to have an antibody administered. On 3 January 2014, in a New Year message, Iommi announced that he would be finishing his regular treatment some time that year. A few months later, Black Sabbath announced that due to Iommi&#x27;s health issues, they were undertaking their final tour. Tony Iommi announced that his cancer was in remission.

According to a report in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine from 9 December 2016, Iommi revealed that he was due to have an operation to remove a lump from his throat. In an early 2017 interview with the UK radio show &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, Iommi explained that the lump was not cancerous.

===Religion===
Iommi said in 2016 that he believed in God and was a Catholic, but that he had not attended church services since childhood. In January 2017, a choral work by Iommi entitled &quot;How Good It Is&quot; – with lyrics inspired by Psalm 133 – received its debut performance at Birmingham Cathedral. Catherine Ogle, the Dean of Birmingham, said, &quot;This is a most wonderful gift Tony offered to the cathedral.&quot; Despite this, Iommi clarified to NBC News that &quot;How Good It Is&quot; wasn&#x27;t anything to do with religion: &quot;I don&#x27;t follow any religious path... religiously&quot;, he stated.

In his autobiography, Tony writes that his parents were Catholics but weren&#x27;t regular churchgoers. He continues, &#x27;I hardly go to church either. I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do there. I actually do believe in a God, but I don&#x27;t feel that I have to press the point.&#x27;

==Legacy and influence==

Tony Iommi is widely regarded as one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. In 2005, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine ranked him number 1 on the poll of the &quot;Riff Lords&quot;, praising his &quot;highly distinctive style of fretsmanship that&#x27;s economical yet crushingly effective&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine ranked him number 6 on their list of the &quot;100 Wildest Guitar Heroes&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 25 in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Joel McIver ranked him the 6th greatest metal guitarist of all time. In 2012, readers of &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked Iommi the seventh-greatest rock guitarist of all time. Editors of the same magazine ranked him the greatest heavy metal guitarist of all time.

Iommi has won a number of awards. These include Q Awards (Gibson Les Paul Award, 2015), Kerrang! Awards (Icon, 2018), as well as three Grammy Awards.

Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull has said: &quot;Tony managed to turn his physical impairment around into something that makes him one of the guitar legends – if not for his dexterity of playing but at least for the fact that his contribution to rock music is a unique one&quot;. Gene Simmons of Kiss regards him as &quot;the man who came up with the riffs that launched an army of guitar players&quot;; Ozzy Osbourne calls him &quot;the master of the metal riff&quot; and Ronnie James Dio called him &quot;the ultimate riff master&quot;.

Furthermore, Iommi is recognised by many as the main creator of heavy metal music. Brian May of Queen considers him &quot;the true father of heavy metal&quot;, Eddie Van Halen stated that &quot;without Tony, heavy metal wouldn&#x27;t exist. He is the creator of heavy!&quot; and James Hetfield of Metallica, who was profoundly influenced by Iommi, defines him &quot;The king of the heavy riff&quot;. Rob Halford, vocalist for Judas Priest, when filling in for Ozzy Osbourne during an August 2004 concert in Philadelphia, introduced Iommi to the audience as &quot;The man who invented the heavy metal riff&quot;. Michael Amott of Carcass and Arch Enemy considers Iommi his &quot;guitar hero&quot; and the world&#x27;s greatest guitarist &quot;because he invented the heavy tone and evil riff&quot;. According to Lamb of God singer Randy Blythe, &quot;Iommi is the reason heavy metal exists&quot;. HP Newquist of the National Guitar Museum stated that &quot;His guitar playing has defined the sound of heavy metal for more than four decades, and he has influenced countless thousands—if not millions—of players.&quot;

He has been credited as the forerunner of other styles: Martin Popoff defines him &quot;the godfather of stoner rock&quot;; Jeff Kitts and Brad Tolinski of &quot;Guitar World&quot; assert that &quot;grunge, goth, thrash, industrial, death, doom... whatever. None of it would exist without Tony Iommi&quot;. According to Hawaii Public Radio: &quot;it is hard to imagine Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains without Black Sabbath, and without Tony Iommi. Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Metallica, Slayer, Pantera and essentially every metal band can be traced to the musical framework found in Iommi compositions&quot;.

Many notable musicians count Iommi as a major influence on their own playing; some of them include Jeff Hanneman (Slayer), Dimebag Darrell (Pantera), Slash (Guns N&#x27; Roses, Velvet Revolver), Scott Ian (Anthrax), Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black Label Society), Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine), Billy Corgan (The Smashing Pumpkins), Kim Thayil (Soundgarden), and Nick Oliveri (Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age). Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains was strongly influenced by Iommi&#x27;s dark bendings, which he uses often. Andy LaRocque of King Diamond said that the clean guitar part of &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot; from the &quot;Conspiracy&quot; album is inspired by Iommi&#x27;s playing on &quot;Never Say Die!&quot;.

==Equipment==
Iommi&#x27;s deep and heavy sound was partly born out of necessity—his &quot;revolutionary signature sound&quot; being the result of the accident and the subsequent downtuning by three semitones. He said that his &quot;extreme volume&quot; was likewise necessary, &quot;because we were fed up with people talking over us while we were playing.&quot;

===Guitars===

*Jaydee Custom SGs
Built in Birmingham by luthier John Diggins sometime between 1975 and 1978, the guitar was first used for overdubs on the &#x27;Heaven and Hell&#x27; album and later became one of Iommi&#x27;s main guitars. The guitar is equipped with a 24 fret neck with custom cross inlays, four control knobs (three of which are functional), a disconnected second output jack, a hole for a master volume knob on the pick guard covered up with a black stopper and a highly distressed finish. He had two more built for him. One was made to the same specifications of his first Jaydee SG with a red finish. Another one was made and used during the &quot;Born Again&quot; era, which can be seen on the music videos for &quot;Trashed&quot; and &quot;Zero the Hero&quot;. The differences are the finish, headstock, use of a stoptail bridge, and use of rail humbuckers, as opposed to the 18-pole humbuckers on his two other versions.

*Gibson SG, aka &quot;Monkey&quot;
A 1965 Gibson SG Special in red finish fitted with a Gibson P-90 pick-up in the bridge position and a custom-wound John Birch Simplux, a P-90 style single coil in the neck position. The guitar became Iommi&#x27;s main instrument after his white Stratocaster&#x27;s neck pick-up failed during the recording of Black Sabbath&#x27;s self-titled album. It is currently on permanent display at the New York City Hard Rock Café.
*Gibson Custom Shop SG
The guitar was built by the Gibson Custom Shop in Nashville after Iommi&#x27;s specifications and finished in 1997. The guitar is one of two made as prototypes for the Gibson Custom Shop Limited Edition Iommi Special SG. The guitar features a neck with 24 frets and four control knobs, of which only two are active (much like his old Jaydee Custom guitar).

On 11 August 2010, Iommi announced on his website that this guitar was stolen from the RJD tribute show that Heaven &amp; Hell performed at High Voltage on 24 July 2010. He is asking that anyone with information or leads let them know. He is offering a reward for its safe return.
*Epiphone P94 Iommi SG
A stock Epiphone SG signature model in black finish fitted with P-94 pick-ups which is a version of the Gibson P-90 pick-up designed to fit into existing humbucker housings.
*Gibson SG Standard
A regular left-handed version of the SG fitted with two extra frets to give Iommi the full two octaves which he prefers. The guitar is equipped with his signature pick-up. Iommi was the first guitarist to have a signature pick-up designed and built by Gibson. He also has another model fitted with a Floyd Rose floating tremolo.

*Fender Stratocaster
Iommi played a Fender Stratocaster that was spraypainted white by Iommi and his father during the early days with Black Sabbath. However, the neck pick-up malfunctioned during the recording of their first album, so Iommi quickly turned to his backup Gibson SG to finish the record. Currently Iommi owns two Stratocasters, one of which has been modified with his signature pick-up in the bridge position.
*St. Moritz Tony Iommi Custom SG
Custom built for Iommi by St. Moritz guitars, this is a replica of Iommi&#x27;s Gibson SG &quot;Monkey&quot;. It was used on the 13 album and for the tour.
*BC Rich Ironbird
Custom built for Iommi by BC Rich. Features include Dimarzio pick-ups, two built-in preamps, scalloped fretboard and Iommi&#x27;s trademark cross inlays. This guitar can be seen in Tony&#x27;s Star Licks Video, for Star Licks Productions along with a left handed BC Rich mockingbird.
*Gibson Barney Kessel

They also feature in the two SGs (one black and one red) that the Gibson Custom Shop built for Iommi in late 1997, as prototypes for the Tony Iommi special Custom Shop model. The pick-up is still in production, and available in silver, gold or black covers. It has been used in the Custom Shop models, the factory Iommi SG and most recently in the Epiphone Iommi SG.

<text>Arthur Alexander (May 10, 1940 – June 9, 1993) was an American country-soul songwriter and singer. Jason Ankeny, music critic for AllMusic, said Alexander was a &quot;country-soul pioneer&quot; and that, though largely unknown, &quot;his music is the stuff of genius, a poignant and deeply intimate body of work on par with the best of his contemporaries.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s songs were covered by such stars as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Otis Redding, Tina Turner, Pearl Jam, and Jerry Lee Lewis.

==Life==
Alexander was born in Sheffield, Alabama, United States. Working with Spar Music in Florence, Alabama, Alexander recorded his first single, &quot;Sally Sue Brown&quot;, under the name of June Alexander (short for Junior), which was released in 1960 on Jud Phillips&#x27; Judd Records. (Phillips is the brother of music pioneer Sam Phillips).

A year later, Alexander cut &quot;You Better Move On&quot;, at the fledgling FAME Studios, which at that point was located above the City Drug Store in Florence, Alabama. (The studio would shortly move to its more famous location in nearby Muscle Shoals, Alabama.) Released on Nashville&#x27;s Dot Records, the song became a soul/R&amp;B chart hit, and laid the foundation for the modern recording studio FAME. &quot;You Better Move On&quot; is perhaps Alexander&#x27;s best-known song, covered by the Rolling Stones, the Hollies, George Jones &amp; Johnny Paycheck, Gene Clark (from the Byrds) and Mink DeVille. &quot;Anna (Go to Him)&quot;, a U.S. R&amp;B Top Ten Hit, was covered by the Beatles, Roger McGuinn (from The Byrds) and Humble Pie. The Beatles did live recordings of &quot;Soldier of Love&quot; (also performed by Marshall Crenshaw and Pearl Jam), &quot;A Shot of Rhythm and Blues&quot;, and &quot;Where Have You Been&quot; at the Star-Club in Hamburg in 1962.

In 1962, Steve Alaimo was the first to record Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Every Day I Have to Cry&quot;, which reached No.46 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Dusty Springfield also recorded the song for her first UK solo EP, &quot;I Only Want to Be With You&quot;, released in 1964.

In the mid-1960s, Alexander switched to another label, Sound Stage 7, but failed to find commercial success. Although a 1972 album for Warner Brothers was promising, the singer&#x27;s potential seemed to wither. He secured a pop hit with &quot;Every Day I Have to Cry Some&quot; on Buddah Records in 1975, but the success remained short-lived. The song was also covered by Ike and Tina Turner (produced by Phil Spector), the McCoys, Dusty Springfield, Joe Stampley, C.J. Chenier, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Gentrys and others. The follow-up single &quot;Sharing The Night Together&quot; (written by Muscle Shoals songwriters Ava Aldridge and Eddie Struzick) reached No. 92 on the R&amp;B charts, but earned Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show a Top 10 hit in 1978; the Dr. Hook version was used in the 2012 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Stewie&quot;.

That same year, he first recorded &quot;Burning Love&quot;, which would be covered by Elvis Presley.

For many years, Alexander was out of the music business; he was a bus driver for much of this time. In 1990, he was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. He began to perform again in 1993 as renewed interest was shown in his back catalogue. His last album, &quot;Lonely Just Like Me&quot;, was his first in 21 years.

He signed a new recording/publishing contract in May 1993 but suffered a fatal heart attack on June 9, 1993, in Nashville, three days after performing there with his new band. He is buried in Florence City Cemetery in Florence, Alabama.

==Legacy==
Alexander is the only songwriter whose songs have been covered on studio albums by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan (who recorded &quot;Sally Sue Brown&quot; on his 1988 LP &quot;Down in the Groove&quot;). In 1987, Paul McCartney claimed that &quot;If the Beatles wanted a sound, it was R&amp;B. That&#x27;s what we used to listen to and what we wanted to be like. Black, that was basically it. Arthur Alexander.&quot;

<text>Small GTPases (), also known as small G-proteins, are a family of hydrolase enzymes that can bind and hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP). They are a type of G-protein found in the cytosol that are homologous to the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, but unlike the alpha subunit of G proteins, a small GTPase can function independently as a hydrolase enzyme to bind to and hydrolyze a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to form guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The best-known members are the Ras GTPases and hence they are sometimes called [[Ras subfamily]] GTPases.

A typical G-protein is active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP (i.e. when the GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP). The GDP can then be replaced by free GTP. Therefore, a G-protein can be switched on and off. GTP hydrolysis is accelerated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), while GTP exchange is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Activation of a GEF typically activates its cognate G-protein, while activation of a GAP results in inactivation of the cognate G-protein.
Guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDI) maintain small GTPases in the inactive state.

Small GTPases regulate a wide variety of processes in the cell, including growth, cellular differentiation, cell movement and lipid vesicle transport.

== The Ras superfamily ==

There are more than a hundred proteins in the Ras superfamily. Based on structure, sequence and function, the Ras superfamily is divided into five main families, (Ras, Rho, Ran, Rab and Arf GTPases). The Ras family itself is further divided into 6 subfamilies: Ras, Ral, Rit, Rap, Rheb, and Rad. &quot;Miro&quot; is a recent contributor to the superfamily.

Each subfamily shares the common core G domain, which provides essential GTPase and nucleotide exchange activity.

The surrounding sequence helps determine the functional specificity of the small GTPase, for example the &#x27;Insert Loop&#x27;, common to the Rho subfamily, specifically contributes to binding to effector proteins such as IQGAP and WASP.

The Ras family is generally responsible for cell proliferation, Rho for cell morphology, Ran for nuclear transport and Rab and Arf for vesicle transport.

<text>Maia Christine Anu (born on 15 March 1970) is an Australian singer-songwriter and actress of Torres Strait Islander origin. She gained popularity with the cover song release of the Warumpi Band&#x27;s song &quot;My Island Home&quot; in 1995. Anu has been nominated for many ARIA Awards, winning several, as well as five Deadly Awards, among others. In August 2024 she released a new album and single of the same name, &quot;&quot;.

She started her career as a dancer, and has had an acting career in film, stage (including musical theatre), and television, as well as hosting the &quot;Evenings&quot; radio show on ABC Radio.

==Early life and education==
Maia Christine Anu, was born in Cairns, Queensland, on 15 March 1970. She did not know who her biological father was, and grew up with her Torres Strait Islander mother and stepfather all over Queensland. Her mother is from Saibai Island, and her stepfather was a respected songman on Saibai, originally from Mabuiag Island. He sang traditional songs of the islands, and encouraged family singalongs. He died in 1979 when Christine was 10 years old.

Anu attended Emmaus College in Rockhampton, from which she graduated in 1987. Dancing being her first love, she moved to inner-city Sydney to study at the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association (later known as NAISDA Dance College), which had been established by Carole Johnson. She earned an Associate degree in dance in 1992.

==Career==
===Music===

Anu began performing as a dancer while at college, and became a member of the Bangarra Dance Theatre and the Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre troupes. She toured with Bangarra in 1992 and 1993.

She went on to sing back-up vocals for the Rainmakers, which included Neil Murray, formerly founder-member of the Warumpi Band, for a year. Her first recording was in 1993 with &quot;Last Train&quot;, a dance remake of a Paul Kelly song. The follow-up, &quot;Monkey and the Turtle&quot;, was based on a traditional nursery rhyme from the Torres Strait Islands.

In 1995, Neil Murray won an Australasian Performing Right Association songwriting award for writing &quot;My Island Home&quot;. Anu covered the song, which gained immediate popularity, causing her to be remembered as the principal singer of the song. She released her first album, &quot;Stylin&#x27; Up&quot;, which went platinum, in 1995.

&quot;Come On&quot; was released as the fourth and final single from &quot;Stylin&#x27; Up&quot;. The song peaked at number 94 in Australia on the ARIA Charts. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1996 the song won two of three awards for which it was nominated, including Best Female Artist and Best Indigenous Release. In that year she also won a Deadly Award for best female artist.

Baz Luhrmann asked her to sing on the song &quot;Now Until the Break of Day&quot; on his 1997 album &quot;Something for Everybody&quot; album. It was released as a single, with the video winning another ARIA award in 1999, and led to her being cast in &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;.

In January 1998, Anu teamed up with Archie Roach, Paul Kelly, Judith Durham, Renee Geyer, Kutcha Edwards and Tiddas and formed Singers for the Red Black and Gold. Together they released a cover of &quot;Yil Lull&quot;. In that year, she won the Female Artist of The Year Deadly Award.

In 2000, Anu released &quot;Come My Way&quot; which peaked at number 18 on the ARIA albums chart and went gold. She released the hit single &quot;Sunshine on a Rainy Day&quot;, for which she won the ARIA Awards for both Best Female Artist and Engineer of the Year.

<doc id="395748" wikidata="Q1193729" url="?curid=395748" title="Communicative competence">
<text>The concept of communicative competence, as developed in linguistics, originated in response to perceived inadequacy of the notion of linguistic competence. That is, communicative competence encompasses a language user&#x27;s grammatical knowledge of syntax, morphology, phonology and the like, but reconceives this knowledge as a functional, social understanding of how and when to use utterances appropriately.

Communicative language teaching is a pedagogical application of communicative competence.

The understanding of communicative competence has been influenced by the field of pragmatics and the philosophy of language, including work on speech acts.

The term was coined by Dell Hymes in 1966, reacting against the perceived inadequacy of Noam Chomsky&#x27;s (1965) distinction between &quot;linguistic competence&quot; and &quot;performance&quot;. To address Chomsky&#x27;s abstract notion of competence, Hymes undertook ethnographic exploration of communicative competence that included &quot;communicative form and function in integral relation to each other&quot;. The approach pioneered by Hymes is now known as the ethnography of communication.

==Applications==
The notion of communicative competence is one of the theories that underlies the communicative approach to foreign language teaching. At least three core models exist. The first and most widely used is Canale and Swain&#x27;s model and the later iteration by Canale. In a second model, sociocultural content is more precisely specified by Celce-Murcia, Dornyei, and Thurrell in 1995. For their part, they saw communicative competence as including linguistic competence, strategic competence, sociocultural competence, actional competence, and discourse competence. A third model widely in use in federal language training in Canada is Bachman and Palmer&#x27;s model.

<text>Three Books of Occult Philosophy (&quot;De Occulta Philosophia libri III&quot;) is Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa&#x27;s study of occult philosophy, acknowledged as a significant contribution to the Renaissance philosophical discussion concerning the powers of magic, and its relationship with religion. The first book was printed in 1531 in Paris, Cologne, and Antwerp, while the full three volumes first appeared in Cologne in 1533.

The three books deal with elemental, celestial and intellectual magic. The books outline the four elements, astrology, Kabbalah, numerology, angels, names of God, the virtues and relationships with each other as well as methods of utilizing these relationships and laws in medicine, scrying, alchemy, ceremonial magic, origins of what are from the Hebrew, Greek and Chaldean context.

These arguments were common amongst other hermetic philosophers at the time and before. In fact, Agrippa&#x27;s interpretation of magic is similar to the authors Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola and Johann Reuchlin&#x27;s synthesis of magic and religion, and emphasize an exploration of nature.

== History ==
The first draft of the Three Books was presented by Agrippa in 1510 to Abbot Johannes Trithemius. The text survives to this day and draws heavily from Ficino, Pliny the Elder and Pico Della Mirandola, among other works well-known to scholars of the Renaissance.

In 1526-27, Agrippa published a satirical-critical work called &quot;De Incertitudine Et Vanitate Scientiarum Liber,&quot; in which he seemingly retracted his Three Books, apparently admitting that his occult studies were misguided. However, whether Agrippa was genuine remains a matter of scholarly debate.

The final and complete edition of the Three Books was published in Cologne in 1533. A first English translation was published in 1651.

<text>Coleville (2016 population: ) is a village in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan within the Rural Municipality of Oakdale No. 320 and Census Division No. 13. The village&#x27;s main economic factors are oil and farming, namesake of the Coleville oilfields. The village is named for Malcolm Cole who became the community&#x27;s first postmaster in 1908.

== History ==

;Early settlers
In 1905, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company surveyed the area in preparation for a railway line, and the prospect of rail service attracted settlers to the area. The first settlers arrived in 1906, most of whom had shipped their effects to Battleford, the site of the Dominion Lands office in the area. With the nearest source of wood being on the banks of the South Saskatchewan River, approximately away, most of the first homes constructed in the area were sod houses, either frame structures covered with sods, or else built entirely out of sods. These structures generally collapsed after a few years; however one sod house built by English immigrant James Addison, between 1909 and 1911, has been occupied continuously from its construction to the present.

The site for the Hamlet of Coleville was purchased from Charles Farris, and built on his purchased homestead NE 6-32-23-W3. In 1913, Charles Cole submitted names to the railway, and Coleville was chosen for the station and townsite.

Coleville incorporated as a village on July 1, 1953.

;Railway
The grade was built for the Biggar–Loverna line of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1912, and steel was laid in 1913. The construction of the rail site in Coleville began in 1913 with the construction of the railway station and coal box. Jack Binks, section foreman, was the station&#x27;s first occupant, and George Barrett was the first station agent. After the construction of the station, a water well was required for the steam engines. In 1914 a two-pen, four-car stock yard and hog chute were built, and an 18 metre (60 foot) well was dug by hand. A pump house was built, and the Coleville water tower, which is still in use today, was erected. The first pumpman was Mike Crown. The Bigger–Loverna line became part of the Canadian National Railway in 1923. The section toolhouse was built in 1926, and in 1953 a two-car loading platform was built, and an electric pump was installed in the pumphouse.

The station was closed in 1979, and the tracks were torn up in 1998.

;Elevators
Soon after the arrival of the railroad in 1913, a grain elevator was built by the Scottish Co-op. Bill Donald was its first agent. This original elevator was replaced in 1940 by a new elevator with a storage capacity of . The Alberta Pacific elevator was built in 1917, with Joe Barrows as its first agent. The elevator had a capacity of . It was bought out by Federal Grain in 1943.

The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool was formed in 1924, and built an elevator in Coleville in 1925, now called Pool A. Alf Beal was the first operator. Pool A had a storage capacity of . In the late 1970s Pool A was sold and torn down. The Scottish Co-op elevator was purchased in 1948 by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and became Pool B. The Federal Grain elevator was acquired by the Pool in 1972, and became Pool C. Pool C was torn down in 1998.

;Coleville Post Office
One of the first settlers was Malcolm Cole, who came with his father in 1906, and set up a post office and general store on his homestead shortly thereafter, in the summer of 1907. He named the post office Coleville, derived from his own last name, and the suffix &quot;-ville&quot;. His brother, Charles Cole, who arrived in 1907, was the postmaster from 1908 until 1917. Around 1914 the post office was moved from the Cole homestead to the townsite of Coleville. When John Brent turned the post office over to H. L. Dumouchel, the post office was moved to the Dumouchel store.

Before railway service to the area, mail was carried in from Battleford. After the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was built, the mail was carried from Scott by R. A. Cummings of Kerrobert.

Cork obliterators (used to cancel stamps) in the second half of the 20th century are comparatively rare; however, cork obliterators created by H.L. Dumouchel (acting postmaster from 1928 until 1950) were still in use until they were lost in a post office remodelling sometime after 1951.

;Coleville Rural Telephone Co.
The Coleville Rural Telephone Co. came into being on Friday, January 28, 1916, following a meeting of a group of ratepayers in Dumouchel&#x27;s Drug Store. Shortly thereafter a charter was granted by the Department of Telephones and the company was started by issuing a debenture. On February 5, 1917, a tender of $11,298.40 by Heise, O&#x27;Bready and Small of Elstow was accepted for the construction of the system. The switchboard was located in the store of A. G. Bridger, who was also publisher of the district news sheet. Bridger resigned in 1919, and George Manning became secretary-treasurer and operator. His salary was $40 a month plus long distance commissions. In 1921 this increased to $60 a month. The linesman was Ed Hogarth, who was paid 50¢ an hour plus 10¢ for mileage.

Subscribers paid an annual rental, which covered switching fees and operator costs. Landowners paid a tax levy on phone lines running through their property, which covered repairing and building lines. The levy was based on the quarters of land through which telephone lines ran. There were two rates. A quarter of land which had a line passing through it paid a &#x27;straight&#x27; rate, and a quarter of land in which someone lived and had a phone paid a higher &#x27;take-off&#x27; rate. Since the &#x27;straight&#x27; rate levy was charged regardless of whether the owner had phone service, land owners without phones could be paying as much or more as land owners with phone service. In spite of attempts to reform this system, it remained in place until the government took over the service. In addition to the annual rental and line levy, there was a special levy to pay back the debenture.

Financing for the company was always difficult, as the large rural population meant the construction and maintenance of many miles of poles and wire for each rural subscriber. In the early years, subscribers who could not pay rentals had their phone removed at their expense; however, by the time of the depression in the 1930s, this was no longer practical or desirable. Instead, subscribers were able to pay off their debt by assisting in the erection of new lines and the maintenance of old ones. Because of the difficulties associated with providing rural telephone service, it was resolved by the Rural Telephone Company as early as 1930 that they ask the provincial government to take over telephone operation for the entire province. While the government did finally take over telephone service, this did not occur until the late 1970s.

Early on, use of the phones and the company&#x27;s equipment was strictly regulated. There was a three-minute time limit for conversations. Those who did not have a phone were asked to pay 75¢ for using their neighbour&#x27;s. Farmers and housewives faced fines or prosecution for the use of telephone poles as hitching posts, or incorporating them into their barbed wire fences or clotheslines.

In 1935 George Manning died, and his wife carried on in his capacity until October 1, 1937, when Pat O&#x27;Bready, along with his wife Irene, took over as operator, linesman, and troubleman. They were paid $800 per year plus commissions, though this salary was on paper only. In 1940 the company began to emerge from the depression and gain solid financial footing, and in February 1942 the debenture debt was retired.

In 1950, a wind storm on April 15 damaged or destroyed nearly the entire telephone system, which took six months to repair.

In March 1954, Saskatchewan Government Telephones bought the Coleville Telephone plant for $2,301 while the Rural Company remained agent for the town. A new switchboard was installed, and private lines were made available. In 1956 black wall or desk cradle phones arrived, and the old box-crank phones were reclaimed. On July 1, 1957, Pat O&#x27;Bready resigned as linesman and operator, although he retained the post of troubleman. Six months later the Rural Company resigned as agent for the Government Telephones.

By the 1960s, 24-hour service was being provided. Previously official hours had been from 8 a.m. until 9 or 10 p.m. (depending on season) on weekdays and Saturday, and from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Sundays, although there was always someone available for emergencies. In 1965 the automatic dial system was completed, and calls were no longer routed through the operator. In 1967 the Coleville Rural Teleqhone Co. Ltd. was sold to the Kindersley Rural Telephone Co. Ltd. for $1, and Coleville was allowed one member to sit on the Kindersley board. In 1977 the government took over the Kindersley Rural Telephone Co.

== Demographics ==

In the 2016 Census of Population, the Village of Coleville recorded a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Attractions ==
Amenities in the community include a library, a skating rink and a two-sheet curling rink. At nearby Laing&#x27;s Park, also referred to as the three-mile park in reference to its distance from village, are several ball diamonds and a nine-hole golf course. The golf course once featured a pumpjack hazard.

== Education ==
Coleville is located within the Sun West School Division. Children attend the Rossville School located within the community for kindergarten through grade 7. For grades 8–12, students are bused to Kindersley Composite School, located approximately twenty minutes away in Kindersley.

The Warwick School was a one-room schoolhouse for the area that was closed in 1940. It was moved to Main Street in Coleville in 1946 where it served as the RM&#x27;s office. When the RM moved to a new building in the 1980s, it continued to serve the community, first as the local Scout and Brownie hall, and now as a playschool.

== Notable people ==
Jeni Mayer, author of such children&#x27;s books as &quot;The Mystery of the Turtle Lake Monster&quot; and &quot;Suspicion Island&quot;, was born and raised in Coleville. Canadian artist, Jean A. Humphrey lived in Coleville for over 50 years.

<text>Boy is the debut studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Steve Lillywhite and was released on 20 October 1980 by Island Records. &quot;Boy&quot; contains songs from the band&#x27;s 40-song repertoire at the time, including two tracks that were re-recorded from their original versions on the group&#x27;s debut release, the EP &quot;Three&quot;.

&quot;Boy&quot; was recorded from July to September 1980 at Dublin&#x27;s Windmill Lane Studios, which became U2&#x27;s chosen recording location during the 1980s. It was their first time working with Lillywhite, who employed non-standard production techniques, such as recording drummer Larry Mullen Jr. playing in a stairwell, and recording smashed bottles and cutlery skimmed against a spinning bicycle wheel. The band found Lillywhite to be very encouraging and creative, and he subsequently became a frequent producer of their recorded work. Thematically, the album&#x27;s lyrics reflect on adolescence, innocence, and the passage into adulthood, themes represented on its cover artwork through the photo of a young boy&#x27;s face.

&quot;Boy&quot; received generally positive reviews and included one of U2&#x27;s first singles to receive airplay on US radio, &quot;I Will Follow&quot;. The release was followed by the band&#x27;s first tour of continental Europe and the US, the Boy Tour. The album peaked on the UK chart at number 52 in August 1981 and in the US at number 63. In 2003, &quot;Boy&quot; was ranked 417th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2008, a remastered edition of the record was released.

==Background==

Originally, &quot;Boy&quot; was slated to be produced by Martin Hannett, an in-demand producer at that time for his critically acclaimed work with Joy Division. Hannett had produced U2&#x27;s first single with Island Records, &quot;11 O&#x27;Clock Tick Tock&quot;, but the band did not enjoy working with him, and the prospect of him producing the album was abandoned by Island due to the band&#x27;s objections. Hannett was also severely affected by the May 1980 suicide of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis, the distress of which temporarily impaired his ability to work. Island A&amp;R representative Nick Stewart said: &quot;Martin by that stage was unwell; he seemed to be suffering from a little overdose of one thing or another.&quot;

Looking for a replacement producer, Island sent a copy of U2&#x27;s first release, the EP &quot;Three&quot; (1979), to Steve Lillywhite to gauge his interest in working with them. Listening to the record, he &quot;liked the voice&quot; but thought &quot;it didn&#x27;t sound very good&quot;. Before deciding whether to work with the group, he wanted to see them perform live to figure out a potential creative approach he could take in studio. After visiting Ireland to attend a concert of theirs at a small school hall, Lillywhite was convinced to come on board, thinking, &quot;Oh my God, there&#x27;s something about this&quot;. He subsequently agreed to produce a single for them, &quot;A Day Without Me&quot;. Although the song failed to chart, U2 found they could work amicably with Lillywhite and agreed to have him produce their debut studio album.

==Recording==
&quot;Boy&quot; was recorded at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin from July to September 1980. Lillywhite was displeased with how the &quot;A Day Without Me&quot; single had sounded, particularly the drums, and decided to change how he recorded the band for the rest of the album. He found Windmill Lane Studios to be &quot;very, very dead sounding&quot; and thought it was more conducive to capturing quiet recordings of folk music than the energy of rock music; engineer Kevin Moloney concurred, calling the studio a &quot;late &#x27;70s design, a very wooden dead kind of room&quot;. At that stage in his career, Lillywhite was interested in capturing &quot;3D sound&quot; that conveyed a perspective to the recording. While walking through the stone-walled reception area of the studio, he was impressed with how the space sounded and decided to record drummer Larry Mullen Jr.&#x27;s drum kit in the area&#x27;s stairwell. Using microphones hung from the ceiling at the top of the stairwell, Lillywhite recorded what he described as &quot;this wonderful clattery sound&quot;. They had to wait until the studio&#x27;s receptionist went home in the evenings to record the drums, as the phone rang during the day. Even in the evenings, they were not allowed to disable the phone&#x27;s ringer, resulting in it occasionally interrupting recording in the middle of a take. Mullen found the arrangement strange at first, as he was still acclimating to working with his bandmates together in a studio when Lillywhite set him up separate from the others.

Lillywhite employed a creative, experimental approach as the producer, recording smashed bottles and silverware skimmed against a spinning bicycle wheel for sound effects. The band found him to be very encouraging; lead vocalist Bono called him &quot;such a breath of fresh air&quot;, while guitarist the Edge said he &quot;had a great way of pulling the best out of everybody&quot;. The group&#x27;s rhythm section struggled to keep time at that stage in their career, forcing Lillywhite and Moloney to spend extensive amounts of time at night splicing tape of the multi-track recordings to create drum loops that would be in time. Lillywhite recorded several bass parts played by Adam Clayton in order to teach Clayton the bassline that he ultimately wanted to be played. The approach necessitated Clayton recording many overdubs. With the band members still inexperienced at that point and manager Paul McGuinness giving them autonomy in their music-making process, Lillywhite speculated that he had more influence over the sound of &quot;Boy&quot; than any other producer of any other U2 album.

Some of the songs, including &quot;An Cat Dubh&quot; and &quot;The Ocean&quot;, were written and recorded at the studio. Many of the songs were taken from the band&#x27;s 40-song repertoire at the time, including &quot;Stories for Boys&quot;, &quot;Out of Control&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot;. Without much studio time, the band quickly recorded each song, before spending a few hours on overdubs and moving onto the next song. Bono had not finalized his lyrics prior to the recording sessions; during the group&#x27;s earlier live performances, he often changed lyrics from concert to concert, owing to his lack of interest in lyric writing. The procrastination forced him to finish missing couplets in the studio while his bandmates were busy recording guitars and percussion. Bono was displeased with the vocal performances that he gave in the studio when wearing headphones, and as a result, he changed his approach to sing into a handheld microphone in the control room while listening to playback of the music at high volume. After about six takes of each song, Lillywhite would edit together a composite vocal track of the best parts, after which Bono would listen back and replicate the results by singing another six takes.

==Composition and songwriting==
The Edge recorded all the songs using his Gibson Explorer guitar, and he drew inspiration from music he was listening to at the time, including Television and early Siouxsie and the Banshees. When asked by Elvis Costello about the band&#x27;s musical influences at the time, the Edge explained: &quot;I think we were influenced a lot by music that was rooted in Europe, the German sort of sensibility, the music of Neu! and Kraftwerk, which was about a different sort of way of using chord changes and a sort of nihilistic approach to the backbeat&quot;, &quot;and the UK bands&quot;, &quot;like [Siouxsie and] the Banshees, probably Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&quot; &quot;and Magazine&quot;.

The album&#x27;s theme is the psychological nature of the transition of adolescence from childhood to manhood, with lyrics and atmospheric music examining a dawn of sexuality (&quot;An Cat Dubh&quot;), the entry into adolescence (&quot;Twilight&quot;), mortality (&quot;Out of Control&quot;), the exile from one&#x27;s past enforced by the passage of time (&quot;Into the Heart&quot;), mental disturbance (&quot;The Electric Co.&quot;) and youthful ambition (&quot;The Ocean&quot;). &quot;I Will Follow&quot; focused on the trauma of the early death of Bono&#x27;s mother when he was 14 years old. The album&#x27;s lyrics contain several literary references. For example, &quot;Shadows and Tall Trees&quot; takes its name from a chapter title in the dystopian William Golding novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and &quot;The Ocean&quot; mentions Oscar Wilde&#x27;s novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;.

Music author and ambient historian Mark Prendergast writes that &quot;Boy&quot; has &quot;an aquatic quality, contrasting anthemic rock songs with brooding instrumental passages of spray, fine drizzle and lapping waves&quot;. He further highlighted Lillywhite&#x27;s addition of musique concrète sounds, namely milk bottles and scraped bicycle spokes, to &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, and commented that the Edge&#x27;s &quot;unconventional approach&quot; to his Gibson Explorer throughout the record &quot;was to eschew blues influences for echoed chords and sustained harmonics. He used a system of two Vox amplifiers coupled to two Memory Man echo units linked to a switchbox connected to his guitar.&quot; Music critic Mark Cooper reflected that &quot;U2&#x27;s sound seemed to have come out of nowhere&quot;; he added that the album&#x27;s &quot;drive and exuberance belongs to punk&quot;, citing Mullen&#x27;s crashing drums, the more glam-derived riffs of the Edge, and the chorus of &quot;Stories for Boys&quot; for their similarities with punk&#x27;s &quot;football terrace&quot; sound, but commented that the band&#x27;s &quot;emotional palette&quot; was distinct from punk: &quot;Here was a music thriving on teenage spiritual awakenings with a musical approach that owed next to nothing to tradition.&quot;

==Artwork==
The model boy on the cover is Peter Rowen, the younger brother of Guggi, Bono&#x27;s friend and a former member of the Virgin Prunes. Peter also appeared on the covers of &quot;Three&quot;, &quot;War&quot;, &quot;The Best of 1980–1990&quot;, the unreleased &quot;Even Better than the Early Stuff&quot;, &quot;Early Demos&quot; and many singles. The photographer, Hugo McGuiness, and the sleeve designer, Steve Averill (a friend of Clayton), went on to work on several more U2 album covers.

For the American release and other international distributors, the album&#x27;s cover image was changed, due to Island Records&#x27; fears that it could be perceived as pedophilic. The label&#x27;s in-house designer Bruno Tilley commissioned artist and photographer Sandy Porter to design the new cover. The two were given a very limited budget, precluding them from traveling to U2 and taking photos of them, leaving them with little choice but to use photos of the four band members from a prior shoot. Tilley visited Porter in London to collaborate on the cover. Porter&#x27;s initial idea was to distort the images and create a &quot;more graphic, stylised piece of artwork&quot;, leading to several experiments. These included: photocopying the images and pulling them during the scanning; using a photographic enlarger while moving the baseboard; and photographing the image prints using long exposure while moving them. The result of these processes gave Porter the &quot;raw material&quot; to continue, though some areas of the images did not distort well and were subsequently marked up with a black pen. Taking inspiration from the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; reference in the song &quot;Shadows and Tall Trees&quot;, Porter selected four &quot;rough and distorted images that had a feel how the sea washes and distorts marks in the sand&quot;. He then cut the images with a scalpel, spray mounted them, and further &quot;copied, printed, touched up, recopied and printed&quot; them onto high-contrast photographic paper.

==Release==
&quot;Boy&quot; was released on 20 October 1980 in the UK, and 3 March 1981 in the US. The album reached number 52 in the UK. In the US, it peaked at number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but after the success of U2&#x27;s later material, it re-entered the American charts for a lengthier spell. In the band&#x27;s native Ireland, the album reached number 13, and it placed highest in Canada at number 12. The original releases of &quot;Boy&quot; sold nearly 200,000 copies.

&quot;A Day Without Me&quot; and &quot;I Will Follow&quot; were released as singles on 18 August and 24 October 1980, respectively. &quot;I Will Follow&quot; peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Tracks rock chart in the US, becoming a hit on college radio and establishing a buzz surrounding the group&#x27;s debut.

The album&#x27;s sexual overtones led to its enthusiastic acceptance in American gay clubs shortly after its release. Bono commented on this phenomenon, saying: &quot;import copies got in and, as you know, in America a lot of music is broken in gay clubs and so we had a gay audience, a lot of people who were convinced the music was specifically for them. So there was a misconception if you like.&quot;

In 2008, a remastered edition of &quot;Boy&quot; was released, featuring remastered tracks, along with B-sides and rarities. Three different formats of the remaster were made available. The artwork for the remastered editions of the album was standardised worldwide to that of the 1980 UK release. For Record Store Day 2020, in commemoration of its 40th anniversary, the album was reissued on white vinyl in a limited edition of 10,000 copies.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Boy&quot; received generally favourable reviews. Paul Morley of &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;honest, direct and distinctive&quot;, adding that he found it &quot;touching, precocious, full of archaic and modernist conviction&quot;. Betty Page of &quot;Sounds&quot; said that they &quot;achieved a rare mixture of innocence and aggression&quot;, and described the album as &quot;an overall feeling of loving care and energy intertwined with simplistic and direct hooks and chords&quot;. Lyndyn Barber from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; hailed it as a &quot;rich&quot; record, writing that &quot;&quot;Boy&quot; is more than just a collection of good tracks assembled in an arbitrary order&quot;, and that it had &quot;youthful innocence and confusion&quot;. Robin Denselow of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that it was a &quot;strong debut album&quot;, praising Lillywhite for helping U2 improve since a live show that the reviewer attended. Denselow said the group succeeded at their goal of achieving a balance of &quot;power and sensitivity&quot; and said the record &quot;only needs slightly stronger melodies to be very impressive indeed&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot;″s critic Ian Birch hailed &quot;Boy&quot; as a &quot;timely&quot; album and said, &quot;Firing off a tradition laid down by the likes of Magazine, [Siouxsie and] the Banshees and Joy Division, U2 have injected their own brand of grace and sinewy spaciousness to create a romanticism exactly right for those who sport chunky riffs and mackintoshes&quot;. Declan Lynch of Irish magazine &quot;Hot Press&quot; remarked that he found &quot;Boy&quot; &quot;almost impossible to react negatively to&quot;. K.R. Walston of the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; said that U2 &quot;knows how to nurse a listener along, toying with tempo and chord structures just enough to sound original but not overly avant garde&quot;. The review concluded, &quot;the future shines brightly for bands like this&quot;.

Terry Atkinson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Boy&quot; a &quot;subtly ravishing first album, by turns pretty, propulsive, playful and irresistably catchy&quot;, while further describing it as &quot;supple and melodic, but tough and vital as well&quot;. Atkinson believed that the lyrics had &quot;occasionally trite or vague passages&quot; but were transcended by Bono&#x27;s &quot;heartfelt, soaring vocals&quot;. Sean McAdam of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described it as &quot;a hypnotic album with nuance&quot; that he &quot;recommended without a bit of reservation&quot;. He praised Lillywhite&#x27;s production for creating an &quot;eerie ambience&quot; and said of the band, &quot;U2 have the musical chops, a compelling vocalist... and most importantly 4-minute pop songs that sound at once concise and infectious&quot;. Scot Anderson of the &quot;Iowa City Press-Citizen&quot; called &quot;Boy&quot; &quot;an album that, while flawed, shows the potential of the band&quot;. Anderson thought certain songs were too long or too short, but believed U2 distinguished themselves from their peers with their spirit and humanity, making &quot;a most refreshing splash in the New Wave&quot;. Dave Marsh of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the record&#x27;s music was &quot;unpretentious and riveting&quot; and called U2 &quot;easily the best Irish rock band since Van Morrison&#x27;s original Them troupe&quot;. He also lauded Lillywhite for his &quot;always spearheaded production&quot;. In a separate review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Debra Rae Cohen found the band skilled and likeable while crediting Lillywhite for helping them &quot;blend echoes of several of Britain&#x27;s more adventurous bands into a sound that&#x27;s rich, lively and comparatively commercial.&quot; Overall, she believed the album did not live up to the high standard set by the opening track &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, finding most of it &quot;diffuse and uneven&quot;. More critical was Robert Christgau, who dismissed the album in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;: &quot;Their youth, their serious air, and their guitar sound are setting a small world on fire, and I fear the worst.&quot; The album finished in 18th place on the &quot;Best Albums&quot; list from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1981 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

==Boy Tour==

Following the album&#x27;s release, U2 embarked on the Boy Tour, their first concert tour of continental Europe and the US. Despite being unpolished, these early live performances demonstrated the band&#x27;s potential, as critics complimented their ambition and Bono&#x27;s exuberance. On an otherwise successful American leg of the tour, Bono&#x27;s briefcase containing in-progress lyrics and musical ideas (which were intended for the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;October&quot;) was lost backstage during a March 1981 performance at a nightclub in Portland, Oregon.
== Legacy ==
In 2003, &quot;Boy&quot; was included at number 417 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. The magazine wrote, &quot;Too ingenuous for punk, too unironic for new wave, U2 arrived on &quot;Boy&quot; as big-time dreamers with the ambition to back it up.&quot; In 2006, &quot;Uncut&quot; ranked the album at number 59 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Debut Albums&quot;. It was ranked as the seventh-best U2 album in a 2017 list by &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s Zach Schonfeld, who also called it &quot;a U2 album without the ego&quot; and the &quot;preaching or presumptions of saving the world&quot; that plagued them in the future. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Boy&quot; in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list, praising the band for creating &quot;an incredible collection of songs steeped in lost innocence and apprehensions about entering the adult world.&quot; In &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, Margaret Moser recalled the popularity of &quot;Boy&quot; in Austin amidst the closures and decline of local music clubs: &quot;The newer, hipper Club Foot was a beacon, and we danced away the summer on its cement floor to U2. &quot;Boy&quot; was a glimmer of hope in the approaching darkness of the Reagan years&quot;. In her opinion, the record was &quot;a shout disguised as a whisper, the calm before a storm&quot;, its musical formula foreshadowing the band&#x27;s subsequent success. Reviewing the 2008 reissue, &quot;Q&quot; appraised &quot;Boy&quot; as a remarkably ambitious debut, noting a distinct &quot;adolescent energy&quot; and &quot;gauche charm&quot; to the album, while &quot;Mojo&quot; said it retained its &quot;palpable ardency&quot; years after its release. According to Steven Hyden of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, &quot;&quot;Boy&quot; showed U2 had a strong enough musical identity to command the world&#x27;s attention from the very beginning&quot;.

Some critics have been less impressed by the album in retrospect. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Bill Wyman found it &quot;heady&quot; but &quot;erratic&quot;, while &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot described the album as &quot;callow post-punk that owes a lot to Joy Division and early Public Image Ltd.&quot; According to Ann Powers in the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995), the album &quot;established what might be called [U2&#x27;s] revelationary reputation, hints at the impulse toward faith (after all, its hit was &#x27;I Will Follow&#x27;), but mostly communicates confusion of the adolescent variety.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; critic David Quantick was more negative in his reappraisal, recalling his enjoyment of the album in 1980 as a &quot;rockier&quot; contemporary of Joy Division and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, in spite of Bono&#x27;s &quot;preening&quot; vocal performance, but upon listening to the reissue, felt &quot;shock at how bad it is&quot;. He wrote: &quot;Lilywhite&#x27;s production is stunningly thin, Bono&#x27;s voice is awful, the lyrics are dismal, and only the singles—the Ian Curtis-obsessed &#x27;I Will Follow&#x27; and the great &#x27;Out of Control&#x27;—stand up. The rest is awful prog noodling&quot;.

&quot;Boy&quot; is one of only three U2 albums from which every song has been performed live at least once. &quot;Boy&quot; held this distinction individually until 2017 when all songs from &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; were performed live on the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary tour.
==Track listing==


Early vinyl and some cassette copies have an unlisted and untitled 30-second instrumental sample at the end of the album (following &quot;Shadows and Tall Trees&quot;) of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, a song that would later become &quot;Fire&quot; on the 1981 record &quot;October&quot;. It was dropped from most vinyl and all early CD versions, but was reinstated as an unlisted 12th track on the 2008 remastered edition of &quot;Boy&quot; and appeared in full for the first time as &quot;Saturday Night&quot; on the Deluxe Edition B-sides CD. The 30-second sample is now known as &quot;Saturday Matinee&quot; since the release of the album on online streaming services. Until the remastered release of &quot;Boy&quot;, it was referred to as an early sample of the song &quot;Fire&quot;.

Some pressings of the album, (mostly in North America) indexed the track length of &quot;An Cat Dubh&quot; and &quot;Into the Heart&quot; at 6:21 and 1:53, respectively. The 2008 remastered edition of the album reinstated the original European track lengths of 4:47 and 3:28. Early compact disc releases (West German-pressed and in a digipak) combined the two songs into a single track at 8:15, as did some US jewel-case versions (on the disc itself, but not on the packaging).

==2008 remastered edition==
On 9 April 2008 U2.com confirmed that the band&#x27;s first three albums (&quot;Boy&quot;, &quot;October&quot; and &quot;War&quot;) would be re-released as newly remastered versions. The remastered &quot;Boy&quot; was released on 21 July 2008 in the UK, with the US version following it the next day. As with &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, the cover artwork has been standardised to the original UK release. The remaster of &quot;Boy&quot; was released in three different formats:
#Standard format: A single CD with re-mastered audio and restored packaging. Includes a 16-page booklet featuring previously unseen photos, full lyrics and new liner notes by Paul Morley. The 11 tracks match the previous release of the album.
#Deluxe format: A standard CD (as above) and a bonus CD including b-sides, live tracks and rarities. Also includes a 32-page booklet with previously unseen photos, full lyrics, new liner notes by Paul Morley, and explanatory notes on the bonus material by the Edge.
#Vinyl format: A single album re-mastered version on 180 gram vinyl with restored packaging.

<doc id="395786" wikidata="Q1053713" url="?curid=395786" title="Wakasa Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area that is today the southwestern portion of Fukui Prefecture in the Hokuriku region of Japan. Wakasa bordered on Echizen, Ōmi, Tanba, Tango, and Yamashiro Provinces. It was part of Hokurikudō Circuit. Its abbreviated form name was . Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Wakasa was ranked as a &quot;medium country&quot; (中国) and a near country (近国) in terms of its importance and distance from the capital.

==History==
===Ancient and classical Wakasa===
Wakasa existed as a political entity before the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system and the implementation of the Taihō Code of the Nara period. Wooden shipping tags labelled &quot;Wakasa&quot; have been found in the ruins of Fujiwara-kyō. Per the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, ancient Wakasa was governed by a Kuni no miyatsuko, who was a descendant of Amenohiboko, a semi-legendary prince of Shilla, who settled in Tajima province during the reign of Emperor Suinin. There are archaeological indications that Wakasa was under control of the Yamato state from the mid-4th century. The province of Wakasa was formally established with the creation of the &quot;Ritsuryō&quot; provincial system around 701 AD, and initially consisted of the two districts of Onyū and Mikata. In 825 AD, Ōi was separated from Onyū.

During the Nara and Heian periods, Wakasa was an important source of sea products (salt, fish and &quot;konbu&quot;) to the aristocracy of the capital, so much so that the province was nicknamed . Salt production was especially and important industry. Wakasa was also a strategically important province due to its seaport on the Sea of Japan and was the closest ocean harbour to Kyoto .

The exact location of the provincial capital of Wakasa is unknown, but is believed to have been in what is now the city of Obama. The Wakasa Kokubun-ji and the &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of Wakasa, the Wakasahiko Shrine are also located in Obama.

===Medieval and pre-modern Wakasa===
Due to its location and strategic importance, during the Kamakura period, the position of &quot;shugo&quot; of Wakasa Province was retained directly by the Hōjō clan. After the start of the Muromachi period, the &quot;shugo&quot; of Wakasa was held by the Shiba clan, followed by the Isshiki clan, and then by a cadet branch of the Takeda clan. During the Sengoku period, the Takeda clan were powerful supporters of the Ashikaga shogunate and their &quot;kanrei&quot;, the Hosokawa clan. However, when the Takeda clan erupted into a civil war over an internal succession dispute, the Asakura clan from neighbouring Echizen Province asserted control. The Asakura were in turn destroyed by Oda Nobunaga. The province was the briefly held by Niwa Nagahide, and under the rule of Toyotomi Hideyoshi by Yamauchi Kazutoyo.

Following the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, the victorious Tokugawa Ieyasu assigned the province to Kyōgoku Takatsugu, as &quot;daimyō&quot; of the 92,000 &quot;koku&quot; Obama Domain. Kyōgoku Takatsugu began the construction of Obama Castle and rebuilt the ancient port town as a &quot;jōkamachi&quot; and a centre for the &quot;kitamaebune&quot; coastal trade network. The Kyōgoku clan were transferred to Izumo Province in 1634 and were replaced by Sakai Tadakatsu, an important retainer of the shogunate, who had served as &quot;Tairō&quot; under shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu and Tokugawa Ietsuna. The Sakai clan continued to rule Obama for fourteen generations over 237 years to the end of the Edo period.

===Meiji period and beyond===
During the Bakumatsu period, Obama Domain initially supported the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1865, the domain executed Mito rebellion leader Takeda Kōunsai and 353 of his followers and nominally participated in the Battle of Toba–Fushimi of the Boshin War. However, seeing that the shogunate was doomed, Sakai Tadaaki came out of retirement to seize control of the domain from his adopted son and defected to the imperial cause. Consequently, he was appointed imperial governor of Wakasa by the new Meiji government until the abolition of the han system in 1871.

At the end of 1871, Wakasa was joined by Tsuruga District, Imadate District and Nanjō District to form &quot;Tsuruga Prefecture&quot;. In 1876, Tsuruga Prefecture was divided, with former Wakasa and Tsuruga District joining Shiga Prefecture. In 1881, these area were given to Fukui Prefecture, which then assumed its present borders. Due to geography and these political changes, the area of former Wakasa Province and Tsuruga District have a separate identity, and form the region of modern Fukui.

==Historical districts==
Wakasa Province consisted of three districts:

* Fukui Prefecture
** Mikata District (三方郡)
** Ōi District (大飯郡)
** Onyū District (遠敷郡) - dissolved

<text>Embrace is the debut studio album (and only release) by American post-hardcore band Embrace.

The album, released by Dischord Records, consists of songs composed and performed in the context of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s 1985 Revolution Summer by one of its mainstay acts. Although recorded between November 1985 and February 1986, the album would not be released until 1987, after the demise of that social movement and the dissolution of the band.

==Style==
According to music journalist Andrew Earles, Ian and Alec MacKaye&#x27;s previous bands Minor Threat and The Faith were composed of &quot;highly intelligent, creatively restless personalities--precisely the types artistically fleeing hardcore in droves&quot;. Building off the aggression of Minor Threat, the album draws influence from New Order, The Cure, and &quot;late-&#x27;70s/early-&#x27;80s&quot; post-punk, which Earles says the band played &quot;through the filter of tuneful post-hardcore.

==Production and release==
&quot;Embrace&quot; was compiled from the only two studio sessions the band recorded. The first eleven tracks were laid down in November 1985, while the other three were done in February 1986. All of the songs were recorded by the same lineup at Inner Ear Studios in Arlington, Virginia, with Don Zientara as audio engineer.

The album was released in September 1987 on Dischord Records, in LP format.

==Critical reception==
Though not &quot;as gripping or inventive&quot; as that of Fugazi&#x27;s, the music in the record, &quot;as a vehicle for [Ian MacKaye&#x27;s] righteous, cutting lyrics and strong voice&quot;, is &quot;more than fine&quot;, according to reviewer Ned Raggett, who has described it as having production values that switched around from the &quot;usual domination via guitar&quot; with an emphasis on Ivor Hanson&#x27;s drums, while comparing the work of guitarist Michael Hampton to John McGeoch&#x27;s early work with post-punk bands Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

&quot;Trouser Press&quot;, for its part, was of the view that:

==Reissues==
In 1992, &quot;Embrace&quot; was reissued on CD and Compact Cassette, featuring alternate cover art.

In 2002, the original album was remastered by Chad Clark at Silver Sonya Recording and Mastering in Arlington, Virginia, for its re-release on CD, featuring, as bonus tracks, previously unreleased alternate versions of &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Dance of Days&quot; taken from band&#x27;s second recording session. This edition was reissued in 2008 on red vinyl, although without the additional cuts.

Also in 2002, the song &quot;Money&quot; was featured on the 3-CD compilation box set &quot;20 Years of Dischord&quot;.

In 2009, the album was remastered again, this time at Chicago Mastering Service in Chicago, Illinois, for a reissue in its original vinyl disc format and cover art.

<doc id="395792" wikidata="Q907469" url="?curid=395792" title="Kaga Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area that is today the south and western portion of Ishikawa Prefecture in the Hokuriku region of Japan. Kaga bordered on Echizen, Etchū, Hida, and Noto Provinces. It was part of Hokurikudō Circuit. Its abbreviated form name was .

==History==
 was an ancient province of Japan and is listed as one of the original provinces in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;. The region as a whole was sometimes referred to as . In 701 AD, per the reforms of the Taihō Code, Koshi was divided into three separate provinces: Echizen, Etchū, and Echigo.

In 823 AD, the two eastern districts of Echizen Province (Kaga and Enuma) were separated to form Kaga Province. Kaga was thus the last province to be created under the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system. The same year, the northern portion of Enuma District became Nomi District, and the southern portion on Kaga District became Ishikawa District. Kaga District itself was renamed Kahoku District.

The provincial capital and provincial temple were located in what is now the city of Komatsu; however, there does not appear to have been a provincial nunnery. The &quot;Ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Shirayama Hime Shrine in what is now the city of Hakusan. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Kaga was ranked as a &quot;superior country&quot; (上国) in terms of importance and &quot;middle country&quot; (中国) in terms of distance from the capital. Despite this classification, Kaga never developed a powerful local &quot;gōzoku&quot; clan but was divided into many &quot;shōen&quot; estates.

During the early Sengoku period, the province was largely under the control of the Ikkō-ikki, who established a loosely governed confederation in the province. The area was eventually conquered by Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s general Shibata Katsuie and subsequently came under the control of Maeda Toshiie under the rule of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Maeda clan retained control of the province as part of Kaga Domain during the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. From 1639, Enuma Domain and a portion of Nomi Domain were separated from Kaga Domain into the 100,000 &quot;koku&quot; Daishōji Domain, which was ruled by a junior branch of the Maeda clan.

Following the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the han system in 1871, Kaga Province was divided into Kanazawa Prefecture and Daishōji Prefecture, which were merged with Fukui Prefecture. However, only a few months later in 1872, Kanazawa and Daishōji were divided back out and merged with Nanao Prefecture (the former Noto Province) to form today&#x27;s Ishikawa Prefecture. In 1876, former Etchū Province was united with Ishikawa, only to become separated again in 1883.

==Historical districts==
Kaga Province consisted of four districts:

* Ishikawa Prefecture
** Enuma District (江沼郡) – dissolved
** Ishikawa District (石川郡) – dissolved
** Kahoku District (河北郡)
** Nomi District (能美郡)

==Bakumatsu period domains==

<text>The New Statesman (known from 1931 to 1964 as the New Statesman and Nation) is a British political and cultural news magazine published in London. Founded as a weekly review of politics and literature on 12 April 1913, it was at first connected with Sidney and Beatrice Webb and other leading members of the socialist Fabian Society, such as George Bernard Shaw, who was a founding director. The longest-serving editor was Kingsley Martin (1930–1960), and the most recent editor was Jason Cowley, who assumed the post in 2008 and left in 2024.

Today, the magazine is a print–digital hybrid. According to its present self-description, it has a modern liberal and progressive political position. Jason Cowley, the magazine&#x27;s editor, has described the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as a publication &quot;of the left, for the left&quot; but also as &quot;a political and literary magazine&quot; with &quot;sceptical&quot; politics.

The magazine has recognised and published new writers and critics, as well as encouraging major careers. Its contributors have included John Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Virginia Woolf, Christopher Hitchens, and Paul Johnson. Historically, the magazine was jocularly referred to as &quot;The Staggers&quot; – an example of Oxford &quot;-er&quot; undergraduate slang. The nickname is now used as the title of its rolling politics blog.

Circulation was at its highest in the mid-1960s at 93,000. The magazine encountered substantial difficulties in the following decades as readership fell, but it was growing again by the mid-2010s. In 2020, the certified average circulation was 36,591. Traffic to the magazine&#x27;s website that year reached a new high with 27 million page views and four million distinct users. Associated websites have included CityMetric (now defunct), Spotlight and NewStatesman Tech. In 2018, &quot;New Statesman America&quot; was launched.

== History ==

===Early years===

The &quot;New Statesman&quot; was founded in 1913 by Sidney and Beatrice Webb with the support of George Bernard Shaw and other prominent members of the Fabian Society. The Fabians previously had supported &quot;The New Age&quot; but that journal by 1912 had moved away from supporting Fabian politics and issues such as women&#x27;s suffrage. The first editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; was Clifford Sharp, who remained editor until 1928. Desmond MacCarthy joined the paper in 1913 and became literary editor, recruiting Cyril Connolly to the staff in 1928. J. C. Squire edited the magazine when Sharp was on wartime duties during the First World War.

In November 1914, three months after the beginning of the war, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; published a lengthy anti-war supplement by Shaw, &quot;Common Sense About The War&quot;, a scathing dissection of its causes, which castigated all nations involved but particularly savaged the British. It sold a phenomenal 75,000 copies by the end of the year and created an international sensation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reprinted it as America began its lengthy debate on entering what was then called &quot;the European War&quot;.

During Sharp&#x27;s last two years in the post, from around 1926, he was debilitated by chronic alcoholism and the paper was actually edited by his deputy Charles Mostyn Lloyd. Although the Webbs and most Fabians were closely associated with the Labour Party, Sharp was drawn increasingly to the Asquith Liberals.

Lloyd stood in after Sharp&#x27;s departure until the appointment of Kingsley Martin as editor in 1930 – a position that Martin was to hold for 30 years.

===1931–1960: Kingsley Martin===
In 1931 the &quot;New Statesman&quot; merged with the Liberal weekly &quot;The Nation and Athenaeum&quot; and changed its name to the &quot;New Statesman and Nation&quot;, which it kept until 1964. The chairman of &quot;The Nation and Athenaeum&quot;″s board was the economist John Maynard Keynes, who came to be an important influence on the newly merged paper, which started with a circulation of just under 13,000. It also absorbed &quot;The Week-end Review&quot; in 1934 (one element of which survives in the shape of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;″s Weekly Competition, and the other the &quot;This England&quot; feature). The Competition feature, in which readers submitted jokes and often parodies and pastiches of the work of famous authors, became one of the most famous parts of the magazine. Most famously, Graham Greene won second prize in a challenge to parody his own work.

During the 1930s, Martin&#x27;s &quot;New Statesman&quot; moved markedly to the left politically. It became strongly anti-fascist and pacifist, opposing British rearmament. After the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot;, Martin wrote: &quot;Today if Mr. Chamberlain would come forward and tell us that his policy was really one not only of isolation but also of Little Englandism in which the Empire was to be given up because it could not be defended and in which military defence was to be abandoned because war would totally end civilization, we for our part would wholeheartedly support him.&quot;

The magazine provoked further controversy with its coverage of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union. In 1932, Keynes reviewed Martin&#x27;s book on the Soviet Union, &quot;Low&#x27;s Russian Sketchbook&quot;. Keynes argued that Martin was &quot;a little too full perhaps of good will&quot; towards Stalin, and that any doubts about Stalin&#x27;s rule had &quot;been swallowed down if possible&quot;. Martin was irritated by Keynes&#x27;s article but still allowed it to be printed. In a 17 September 1932 editorial, the magazine accused the British Conservative press of misrepresenting the Soviet Union&#x27;s agricultural policy but added that &quot;the serious nature of the food situation is no secret and no invention&quot;. The magazine defended the Soviet collectivisation policy, but also said the policy had &quot;proceeded far too quickly and lost the cooperation of farmers&quot;. In 1934 it ran an interview with Stalin by H. G. Wells. Although sympathetic to aspects of the Soviet Union, he disagreed with Stalin on several issues. The debate resulted in several more articles in the magazine; in one of them, George Bernard Shaw accused Wells of being disrespectful to Stalin during the interview.

In 1938 came Martin&#x27;s refusal to publish George Orwell&#x27;s celebrated dispatches from Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War because they criticised the communists for suppressing the anarchists and the left-wing Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). &quot;It is an unfortunate fact&quot;, Martin wrote to Orwell, &quot;that any hostile criticism of the present Russian regime is liable to be taken as propaganda &quot;against socialism&quot;&quot;. Martin also refused to allow any of the magazine&#x27;s writers to review Leon Trotsky&#x27;s anti-Stalinist book &quot;The Revolution Betrayed&quot;.

Martin became more critical of Stalin after the Hitler-Stalin pact, claiming Stalin was &quot;adopting the familiar technique of the Fuhrer&quot;, and adding: &quot;Like Hitler, he [Stalin] has a contempt for all arguments except that of superior force.&quot; The magazine also condemned the Soviet Invasion of Finland.

Circulation grew enormously under Martin&#x27;s editorship, reaching 70,000 by the end of the Second World War. This number helped the magazine become a key player in Labour politics. The paper welcomed Labour&#x27;s 1945 general election victory but took a critical line on the new government&#x27;s foreign policy. The young Labour MP Richard Crossman, who had become an assistant editor of the magazine before the war, was Martin&#x27;s chief lieutenant in this period, and the &quot;Statesman&quot; published &quot;Keep Left&quot;, the pamphlet written by Crossman, Michael Foot and Ian Mikardo, that most succinctly laid out the Labour left&#x27;s proposals for a &quot;third force&quot; foreign policy rather than alliance with the United States.

During the 1950s, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; remained a left critic of British foreign and defence policy and of the Labour leadership of Hugh Gaitskell, although Martin never got on personally with Aneurin Bevan, the leader of the anti-Gaitskellite Labour faction. The magazine opposed the Korean War, and an article by J. B. Priestley directly led to the founding of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

There was much less focus on a single political line in the back part of the paper, which was devoted to book reviews and articles on cultural topics. Indeed, with these pages managed by Janet Adam Smith, who was literary editor from 1952 to 1960, the paper was sometimes described as a pantomime horse: its back half was required reading even for many who disagreed with the paper&#x27;s politics. This tradition would continue into the 1960s with Karl Miller as Smith&#x27;s replacement.

===1960–1996: After Kingsley Martin===
Martin retired in 1960 and was replaced as editor by John Freeman, a politician and journalist who had resigned from the Labour government in 1951 along with Bevan and Harold Wilson. Freeman left in 1965 and was followed in the chair by Paul Johnson, then on the left, under whose editorship the &quot;Statesman&quot; reached its highest ever circulation. For some, even enemies of Johnson such as Richard Ingrams, this was a strong period for the magazine editorially. From 1964 to 1981, the &quot;Statesman&quot; was chaired by Jock Campbell, who endowed the &quot;Jock Campbell-New Statesman Award&quot;, a prize of £1,000 that was given every three years for 12 years, with writers born in Africa or the Caribbean being eligible (and winners including Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Shiva Naipaul, Derek Walcott and Buchi Emecheta).

After Johnson&#x27;s departure in 1970, the &quot;Statesman&quot; went into a long period of declining circulation under successive editors: Richard Crossman (1970–72), who tried to edit it at the same time as playing a major role in Labour politics; Anthony Howard (1972–78), whose recruits to the paper included Christopher Hitchens, Martin Amis and James Fenton (surprisingly, the arch anti-Socialist Auberon Waugh was writing for the &quot;Statesman&quot; at this time before returning to &quot;The Spectator&quot;); Bruce Page (1978–82), who moved the paper towards specialising in investigative journalism, sacking Arthur Marshall, who had been writing for the &quot;Statesman&quot; on and off since 1935, as a columnist, allegedly because of the latter&#x27;s support for Margaret Thatcher; Hugh Stephenson (1982–86), under whom it took a strong position again for unilateral nuclear disarmament; John Lloyd (1986–87), who swung the paper&#x27;s politics back to the centre; Stuart Weir (1987–90), under whose editorship the &quot;Statesman&quot; founded the Charter 88 constitutional reform pressure group; and Steve Platt (1990–96).

The &quot;Statesman&quot; acquired the weekly &quot;New Society&quot; in 1988 and merged with it, becoming &quot;New Statesman and Society&quot; for the next eight years, then reverting to the old title, having meanwhile absorbed &quot;Marxism Today&quot; in 1991. In 1993, the &quot;Statesman&quot; was sued by Prime Minister John Major after it published an article discussing rumours that Major was having an extramarital affair with a Downing Street caterer. Although the action was settled out of court for a minimal sum, the magazine&#x27;s legal costs almost led to its closure.

In 1994, KGB defector Yuri Shvets said that the KGB utilised the &quot;New Statesman&quot; to spread disinformation. Shvets said that the KGB had provided disinformation, including forged documents, to the &quot;New Statesman&quot; journalist Claudia Wright, which she used for anti-American and anti-Israel stories in line with the KGB&#x27;s campaigns.

===Since 1996===
The &quot;New Statesman&quot; was rescued from near-bankruptcy by a takeover by businessman Philip Jeffrey but in 1996, after prolonged boardroom wrangling over Jeffrey&#x27;s plans, it was sold to Geoffrey Robinson, the Labour MP and businessman. Following Steve Platt&#x27;s resignation, Robinson appointed a former editor of &quot;The Independent&quot;, Ian Hargreaves, on what was at the time an unprecedentedly high salary. Hargreaves fired most of the left-wingers on the staff and turned the &quot;Statesman&quot; into a strong supporter of Tony Blair&#x27;s leadership of the Labour Party.

Hargreaves was succeeded by Peter Wilby, also from the &quot;Independent&quot; stable, who had previously been the &quot;Statesman&quot;s books editor, in 1998. Wilby attempted to reposition the paper back &quot;on the left&quot;. His stewardship was not without controversy. In 2002, for example, the periodical was accused of antisemitism when it published an investigative cover story on the power of the &quot;Zionist lobby&quot; in Britain, under the title &quot;A Kosher Conspiracy?&quot; The cover was illustrated with a gold Star of David resting on a Union Jack. Wilby responded to the criticisms in a subsequent issue. During Wilby&#x27;s seven-year tenure, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; moved from making a financial loss to having a good operating profit, though circulation only remained steady at around 23,000.

John Kampfner, Wilby&#x27;s political editor, succeeded him as editor in May 2005 following considerable internal lobbying. Under Kampfner&#x27;s editorship, a relaunch in 2006 initially saw headline circulation climb to more than 30,000. However, more than 5,000 of these were apparently monitored free copies, and Kampfner failed to maintain the 30,000 circulation he had pledged. In February 2008, Audit Bureau Circulation figures showed that circulation had plunged nearly 13% in 2007. Kampfner resigned on 13 February 2008, the day before the ABC figures were made public, reportedly due to conflicts with Robinson over the magazine&#x27;s marketing budget (which Robinson had apparently slashed in reaction to the fall in circulation).

In April 2008, Geoffrey Robinson sold a 50% interest in the magazine to businessman Mike Danson, and the remainder a year later. The appointment of the new editor Jason Cowley was announced on 16 May 2008, but he did not take up the job until the end of September 2008.

In January 2009, the magazine refused to recognise the National Union of Journalists, the trade union to which almost all of its journalists belonged, though further discussions were promised but never materialised.

Cowley was named current affairs editor of the year at the British Society of Magazine Editors awards in 2009, and in 2011 he was named editor of the year in the Newspaper &amp; Current Affairs Magazine Category at the British Society of Magazine Editors awards, while Jon Bernstein, the deputy editor, gained the award for Consumer Website Editor of the Year. Cowley had been shortlisted as Editor of the Year (consumer magazines) in the 2012 PPA (Professional Publishers Association) Awards. He was also shortlisted for the European Press Prize editing award in January 2013, when the awards committee said: &quot;Cowley has succeeded in revitalising the New Statesman and re-establishing its position as an influential political and cultural weekly. He has given the New Statesman an edge and a relevance to current affairs it hasn’t had for years.&quot;

The magazine published a 186-page centenary special in April 2013, the largest single issue in its history. It also published two special editions (250 and 150 pages), showcasing 100 years of the best and boldest journalism from its archives. In the following year it expanded its web presence by establishing two new websites: May2015.com, a polling data site focused on the 2015 general election, and CityMetric, a cities magazine site under the tagline, &quot;Urbanism for the social media age&quot; and edited by Jonn Elledge.

It was announced in December 2016 that the Weekend Competition, a feature inherited from &quot;The Week-end Review&quot;, would be discontinued, for reasons of space.

The &quot;New Statesman&quot; took a neutral position in the 2019 general election. It was the first time in the magazine&#x27;s history it had explicitly chosen not to endorse Labour.

As of 2020, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; considers itself a &quot;print-digital hybrid&quot; with peak online traffic of more than 4 million unique visitors per month, almost a four-fold increase since 2011. This compares to the magazine&#x27;s overall circulation of 36,591, and paid-for circulation of 34,451 as of January 2021, the highest level for 40 years.

At the 2020 British Society of Magazine Editors (BSME) awards, editor Jason Cowley was named Current Affairs and Politics editor of the year for the fourth time, defeating rivals from &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Big Issue&quot; and &quot;Prospect&quot;. &quot;In increasingly tribal times, Jason Cowley continues to champion independence of thought and diversity of opinion, challenging his audience and producing a magazine that&#x27;s imaginative, unpredictable and interesting&quot;, the BSME judges said on presenting the award.

The magazine&#x27;s Spotlight series (which publishes specialist business content) also won the Launch of the Year award, with judges describing the supplements as a &quot;great example of monetising a brand without losing its integrity&quot;. Following Andrew Marr&#x27;s leaving the BBC in 2021, he joined the magazine as chief political commentator.

In June 2024, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; accidentally spread the false report that Noam Chomsky had died.

==Guest editors==
In March 2009, the magazine had its first guest editor, Alastair Campbell, the former head of communications for Tony Blair. Campbell chose to feature his partner Fiona Millar, Tony Blair (in an article &quot;Why we must all do God&quot;), football manager Alex Ferguson, and Sarah Brown, the wife of Prime Minister Gordon Brown. This editorship was condemned by Suzanne Moore, a contributor to the magazine for twenty years. She wrote in a &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; article: &quot;&quot;New Statesman&quot; fiercely opposed the Iraq war and yet now hands over the reins to someone key in orchestrating that conflict&quot;. Campbell responded: &quot;I had no idea she worked for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. I don&#x27;t read the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;. But professing commitment to leftwing values in that rightwing rag lends a somewhat weakened credibility to anything she says.&quot;

In September 2009, the magazine was guest-edited by Labour politician Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London.

In October 2010, the magazine was guest-edited by British author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. The issue included a previously unpublished poem by Ted Hughes, &quot;Last letter&quot;, describing what happened during the three days leading up to the suicide of his first wife, the poet Sylvia Plath. Its first line is: &quot;What happened that night? Your final night.&quot;—and the poem ends with the moment Hughes is informed of his wife&#x27;s death.

In April 2011, the magazine was guest-edited by human rights activist Jemima Khan. The issue featured a series of exclusives including the actor Hugh Grant&#x27;s secret recording of former &quot;News of the World&quot; journalist Paul McMullan, and a much-commented-on interview with Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, in which Clegg admitted that he &quot;cries regularly to music&quot; and that his nine-year-old son asked him, &quot;&#x27;Why are the students angry with you, Papa?&#x27;&quot;

In June 2011, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, created a furore as guest editor by claiming that the Coalition government had introduced &quot;radical, long term policies for which no one had voted&quot; and in doing so had created &quot;anxiety and anger&quot; among many in the country. He was accused of being highly partisan, notwithstanding his having invited Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary to write an article and having interviewed the Foreign Secretary William Hague in the same edition. He also noted that the Labour Party had failed to offer an alternative to what he called &quot;associational socialism&quot;. The &quot;Statesman&quot; promoted the edition on the basis of Williams&#x27; alleged attack on the government, whereas Williams himself had ended his article by asking for &quot;a democracy capable of real argument about shared needs and hopes and real generosity&quot;.

In December 2011 the magazine was guest-edited by Richard Dawkins. The issue included the writer Christopher Hitchens&#x27;s final interview, conducted by Dawkins in Texas, and pieces by Bill Gates, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett and Philip Pullman.

In October 2012 the magazine was guest-edited by Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei and, for the first time, published simultaneously in Mandarin (in digital form) and English. To evade China&#x27;s internet censors, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; uploaded the issue to file-sharing sites such as BitTorrent. As well as writing that week&#x27;s editorial, Ai Weiwei interviewed the Chinese civil rights activist Chen Guangcheng, who fled to the United States after exposing the use of compulsory abortions and sterilisations. The issue was launched on 19 October 2012 at the Lisson Gallery in London, where speakers including artist Anish Kapoor and lawyer Mark Stephens paid tribute to Ai Weiwei.

In October 2013 the magazine was guest-edited by Russell Brand, with contributions from David Lynch, Noel Gallagher, Naomi Klein, Rupert Everett, Amanda Palmer, and Alec Baldwin, as well as an essay by Brand.

In October 2014, the magazine was guest-edited by the artist Grayson Perry, whose essay titled &quot;Default Man&quot; was widely discussed.

The former British prime minister Gordon Brown guest-edited the magazine in 2016, a special edition exploring Britain&#x27;s relationship with Europe ahead of the EU referendum. Contributors to the issue included the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and Michael Sandel.

<text>In ancient Etruscan and Roman mythology, Mania (), also spelled Manea, was a goddess of the dead, spirits and chaos: she was said to be the mother of ghosts, the undead, and other spirits of the night, as well as the Lares and the Manes.
She, along with Mantus (), ruled the underworld.

Her counterpart in Greek mythology, also named Mania (or Maniae), was the goddess of insanity and madness.

== Etymology ==
Her name links her to the Manes, Mana Genita, and Manius.

Both the Greek and Latin &quot;Mania&quot; derive from PIE (Proto-Indo-European) *&quot;men-&quot;, &quot;to think.&quot; Cognates include Ancient Greek , and Avestan .

==See also==
* Mother of the Lares () – Roman chthonic goddess identified with Mania by Varro

==Biography==

===Personal life===
John T. L. &quot;Jack&quot; Hitt was born in 1957 in Charleston, South Carolina to Ann Leonard Hitt and Robert Hitt Jr. He was the youngest of five children. He was raised in Charleston and attended the Porter-Gaud School. At Porter-Gaude, Hitt got his start in writing by contributing to and editing the school&#x27;s literary magazine. While growing up in Charleston, Hitt lived in the same neighborhood as Dawn Langley Simmons who would receive one of the first sex reassignment surgeries in the United States.

Hitt attended the in Sewanee, Tennessee where he majored in comparative literature. As an undergrad, he worked at the Learning Disabilities Center and taught math and English to teens and children. He also tutored Latin. He was president of the Spanish House and a member of the Spanish Honor Society.

It was at Sewanee that Hitt first heard about the road to Santiago de Compostela. He would write about the experience of walking the road in his first book, &quot;Off The Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim&#x27;s route into Spain.&quot;

Hitt graduated from the University of the South in 1979.

&quot;I was nearly a Latin professor&quot;, said Hitt in an interview with &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. &quot;Upon graduation, my Classics teacher warned me that while I&#x27;d read the hundred or so greatest works of Latin literature, post-graduate work meant reading the 1,000 &#x27;eh&#x27; works of Latin literature...I seized my diploma and I&#x27;ve never translated a line of Latin since.&quot;

Hitt lived in an apartment in New York City for about 8 years before he met and married his current wife Lisa Sanders in the late 1980s. They live together in New Haven, Connecticut and have two daughters.

Jack Hitt&#x27;s older brother Robert M. Hitt III served as Secretary of Commerce for the state of South Carolina from January 2011 to June 2021.

===Writing and journalism career===
Hitt has been a contributing editor to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;This American Life&quot;, and &quot;Lingua Franca&quot;.

Hitt&#x27;s &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; piece about a dying language called &quot;Say No More&quot; was selected for inclusion in &quot;The Best American Travel Writing&quot; 2005. A piece originally published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; titled &quot;Mighty White of You: Racial Preferences Color America&#x27;s Oldest Skulls and Bones&quot; was selected for inclusion in &quot;Best American Science Writing&quot; 2006. Another piece from &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; titled &quot;Toxic Dreams: A California Town Finds Meaning in an Acid Pit&quot;, was included in Ira Glass&#x27;s &quot;The New Kings of Nonfiction&quot; (2007).

Jack Hitt and Paul Tough won a Livingston award for an article published in &quot;Esquire&quot; they wrote about Hackers titled &quot;Terminal Delinquents.&quot;

<text>Mazarine Marie Mitterrand Pingeot (; born Mazarine Marie Pingeot on 18 December 1974) is a French writer, journalist and professor.

== Biography ==
Pingeot is the daughter of former French president François Mitterrand and his mistress Anne Pingeot. She is said to be named after the Bibliothèque Mazarine, the oldest library in France, because of her parents&#x27; love for books. She could also be named after cardinal Mazarin, who was admired by her father. Her existence was long hidden from the press but was once almost revealed by the French writer Jean-Edern Hallier. Keeping Mazarine Pingeot&#x27;s identity from the public was one of the motivations behind some of the illegal wiretapping that Mitterrand ordered under the guise of fighting terrorism. Pingeot legally adopted her father&#x27;s surname in November 2016.

She was a student first at the elite Lycée Henri-IV in Paris and then at the École Normale Supérieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud (now named the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon), a highly prestigious school. In 1997, she passed the &quot;agrégation de philosophie&quot;, and then briefly started - but did not complete - a Ph.D. thesis on the philosopher Spinoza, working as a teaching assistant at the Université de Provence Aix-Marseille I.

She was also a journalist (writing for &quot;Elle&quot; between 1999 and 2001) and a television anchor (on a French cable television channel, Paris Première).

==Works==
In 1998, she published her first novel, titled &quot;Premier Roman&quot; (&quot;First Novel&quot;), which was not highly praised by critics but was translated into many languages, including English. In 2000, she published &quot;Zeyn or the Reconquest&quot;, for which Charles Bremner of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote &quot;If there was a prize for braving the &quot;ridicule&quot; of critics, it would go to Mazarine Pingeot&quot; (8 May 2000). In 2003, she published a series of literary comments, &quot;They told me who I was&quot; (&quot;they&quot; being the books). In February 2005, she published her fourth book, &quot;Not a Word&quot;, a diary about her childhood life as a national secret. In 2007, she published her fifth book, &quot;Le Cimetière des poupées&quot; (The Cemetery of the Dolls), a novel about a woman who kills her baby and puts it in a freezer.

In 2019, Mitterrand Pingeot published a novel titled &quot;Se taire&quot; (&quot;Keeping quiet&quot;) about a female photographer raped by a prominent politician. Commentators have drawn parallels with the accusations by her niece Pascale Mitterrand against the French politician Nicolas Hulot, which accusations had been dismissed by the French authorities.
Mitterrand Pingeot&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Et la peur continue&quot; (&quot;And the fear is constant&quot;) follows a woman who lives in a constant state of fear caused by the everyday pressures she experiences in her professional and personal life.

==Family==
She has one son, Astor, born in 2005, and two daughters, born in 2007 and 2009, with her former partner , a film director. In 2017 she married diplomat .

<doc id="395822" wikidata="Q204208" url="?curid=395822" title="The Knight in the Panther's Skin">
<text>The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin ( literally &quot;the one with the skin of a tiger&quot;) is a Georgian medieval epic poem, written in the 12th or 13th century by Georgia&#x27;s national poet Shota Rustaveli. A definitive work of the Georgian Golden Age, the poem consists of over 1600 Rustavelian Quatrains and is considered to be a &quot;masterpiece of the Georgian literature&quot;. Until the early 20th century, a copy of this poem was part of the dowry of every bride.

Although the poem takes place in the fictional settings of &quot;India&quot; and &quot;Arabia&quot;, events in these distant lands are but a colorful allegory of the rule of Queen Tamar of Georgia, and the size and glory of the Kingdom of Georgia in its Golden Age. It tells of the friendship of two heroes, Avtandil and Tariel, and their quest to find the object of love, Nestan-Darejan, an allegorical embodiment of Queen Tamar. These idealized heroes and devoted friends are united by courtly love, generosity, sincerity, and dedication. The poem is regarded as the &quot;coronation of thought, poetic and philosophical art of medieval Georgia&quot;, a complex work with rich and transcending genres. It has been described as &quot;epic&quot;, &quot;chivalric romance&quot;, &quot;epic romance&quot; and &quot;epic poem of lyric poetry.&quot; Despite its formal complexity, it bears to this day &quot;the Georgian vision of the world.&quot;

==History of the work==
===Context and time===
The poem was written during the Golden Age of the Kingdom of Georgia and the reign of Queen Tamar, who was enthroned by her father King George III of Georgia. Tamar was celebrated by poets for her beauty, intelligence, and diplomatic skills. She expanded the Georgian kingdom to its historical maximum, repulsed invasions, and established protectorates over many area Muslim and Christian lands. Under her reign, the economy prospered. Georgian trading caravans reached Ayyubid Egypt, the Kievan Rus, and the Byzantine Empire. Medieval science developed, and the largest monasteries and churches in Georgia were built. Secular literature developed to the point of equaling the greatest religious texts. 

Against the backdrop of this &quot;remarkable growth&quot;, Shota Rustaveli composed his poem. Rustaveli, born in Rustavi, a Meskhetian village, was close to King Tamar and possibly served as her treasurer. He likely participated in many military campaigns. The stories in his poem are set in faraway lands, but his allegorical representations of contemporaneous Georgia are recognizable. For instance, he refers to wine culture and a female king who became an heir of her father.

In the prologue, Rustaveli says that he wrote this poem to praise the &quot;King&quot; Tamar.
And in the epilogue (given here with a formal paraphrase), he praises the queen&#x27;s king consort David Soslan.
===Genre and style===
Though written in Georgian at the height of the pan-Caucasian empire of the Georgian Bagratids, according to the modern historian Stephen H. Rapp, &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; &quot;was an expression of the Iranian/Iranic epic and not some genre of Byzantine literature&quot;. Rustaveli used a Persian model for writing &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;. In the work&#x27;s prologue, the modern historian Nile Green explains, Rustaveli publicly declares his 1,600-quatrain epic, written in the &quot;shairi&quot; verse form, as a &quot;Persian tale, translated into Georgian / Like an orphaned pearl, like a toy passed from hand to hand&quot;.

==Content and form==

===Title===
Georgian title () literally means &quot;one with a skin of &quot;. The identity of the animal that it refers to is not certain and it can be a tiger, panther or leopard. In modern Georgian, it refers to the tiger. However, according to more modern research it would rather mean a panther. Similarly, the qualification of &quot;knight&quot; is not derived from the original title and its alternative translations exist, such as the &quot;valiant&quot; or simply a &quot;man.&quot; The alternative English titles of the poem also are &quot;Lord of the Panther Skin&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;.

===Story===
The story can be divided into two parts: the first part is Avtandil&#x27;s quest for Tariel, the titular &quot;knight in the panther&#x27;s skin&quot;, and the second part is Avtandil&#x27;s quest for Nestan-Darejan, Tariel&#x27;s love.

====Search for Tariel====

The King of Arabia, Rostevan, has no sons and confers the kingship on his only daughter, the beautiful and wise Tinatin. She has a tender affection for Avtandil, the knight and commander-in-chief of Rostevan&#x27;s armies. One day, Avtandil challenges King Rostevan to a hunting competition. After three days of shooting game, they encounter a knight crying by a river. He is dressed in a panther&#x27;s skin, and kills the slaves sent by the king to contact him, then disappears. Rostevan sends parties across the world to search for the mysterious knight, but becomes disheartened when he fails. 

Tinatin asks Avtandil to find the strange knight in three years, promising him her hand in marriage in return. After two years and nine months of searching, Avtandil finds the knight in the panther&#x27;s skin hiding in a cave, with only a maiden for company. His name is Tariel, son of King Saridan, who has the seventh kingdom of India. He had served as heir to King Pharsadan, king of the other six kingdoms, for many years before falling in love with Pharsadan&#x27;s daughter, Nestan-Darejan. Tariel wages war with the Khatavians to earn the favor of Nestan, but is dismayed to learn that she has already been promised to the Khwarezmian prince. 

Tariel could not bear the idea of her marriage, and at Nestan&#x27;s request, he killed the suitor. The princess was placed on a boat and set adrift on the seas. Despite Tariel&#x27;s lengthy search for his love, he could not find her. Later he met Nuradin-Phridon, ruler of Mulgazanzar, who told him that Nestan was alive but trapped on a distant boat. Tariel retired to a cave to live in the wilderness with Asmat, the former servant and messenger of Nestan. Moved by this story, Avtandil promises his friendship and brotherhood to Tariel, and agrees to help him find his love, Nestan-Darejan. Avtandil returns home to Arabia, and tells Tinatin the story of Tariel. Against King Rostevan&#x27;s wishes, he returns to his new friend.

====Search for Nestan-Darejan====
Avtandil then leaves Tariel to go to the kingdom of Phridon, where he does not hear anything new about Nestan. Continuing his quest, he arrives in the city of Gulansharo. He meets Patman, the wife of the chief Usen, who falls in love with him. Avtandil, sensing she knows the fate of Nestan, succumbs to Patman&#x27;s seduction. She tells him she has been keeping Nestan at her place and, as Nestan was promised to the king&#x27;s son, she helped her escape, but in her flight Nestan was abducted by Kaji the demon king. Avtandil then returns home to Phridon and to the cave of Tariel and later all three friends decide to go to the country of Kaji with an army of three hundred men to find and deliver Nestan. When she is released, all return to Arabia, where King Rostevan forgives Avtandil his flight and breaking the king&#x27;s order. They all celebrate the marriage of the latter with the king&#x27;s only daughter, Tinatin. They then leave for India where Tariel marries his love Nestan. Phridon also returns to his homeland and the three friends reign happily with prosperity and generosity in their own respective realms.

==Places and characters==
===Places===
The poem is placed far away from Georgia in countries that the poet has certainly never visited: Arabia, India and &quot;Khataeti&quot; that is to say, China. The indications are vague and do not designate any particular site. It is the Georgian kingdom that has existed through these distant lands. It seems that the choice of places refers primarily to the national character of these peoples: the Arabs are portrayed as more rational, as the king Rostevan and his knight Avtandil with their communication skills and action help to break deadlocks. Conversely, the Indians appear to be more emotional and impulsive and cause unintended disasters, as of the image of Tariel and Nestan. Other locations mentioned as the Kajeti or country of Kaj demons are imaginary. Gulansharo, capital of the &quot;Kingdom of the Seas&quot;, has been compared to Venice.

===Characters===

;The brave and loyal knights — Avtandil and Tariel
These two characters represent the most devoted friends, and tender lovers; both heroes capable of courtly love and men endowed with free will. They initially were actively involved and served the kingdoms held position of modern &quot;steward&quot; or &quot;Mayor of the Palace&quot;. Besides their position they only obey their beloveds, therefore their love and dedication is unwavering. The mutual commitment and friendship they swear, also extends to a third person, Nuradin-Pridon, who is also endowed with the same heroic qualities. Tariel is, however, distinguished by his wild character as symbolized by his wearing the panther&#x27;s skin. The qualities associated with the cat, his dedication and courage, his hatred and violence could be extreme and uncontrollable. It is also close to Saint George slaying the dragon whose cult was particularly strong in the 12th century especially in the episode where Tariel kills a lion and a panther.

;The faithful and patient lovers — Tinatin and Nestan-Darejan
Although they take little action, the female characters, Tinatin and Nestan-Darejan are constantly present in thoughts of the knights and serve to give the narrative tension as a whole. Princesses, higher in social rank than their servant knights, are inspired by the Queen Tamar or reflect the fact that each of them is the sovereign in their own realm. Tinatin chooses her own husband which references Queen Tamar (who also chose her second husband) as her role as the sovereign. and her father Rostevan, ceding his throne to his daughter references King George III of Georgia who was succeeded by her daughter in 1178, after his death.

Tinatin is a static character who leaves no time to the court of her father in Arabia. Nestan, a prisoner in distant regions, is also passive. But their confidence, righteousness, shows these two women being faithful and respective lovers. As for Patman, she is an altered representation of their type but an adulteress during the absence of her husband. Patman takes little account of family honor as she humiliates her husband on account of his bodily defects. Her character is true to life from the artistic point of view. Despite everything, she is capable of displaying both affection and sincere warmth peculiar to a woman. She spares no effort to save Nestan. It is very characteristic that when Patman learns of the purpose of Avtandil&#x27;s journey, she makes no attempt to keep the man she loves at her side even for a short time.

==Human relationships==

Rustaveli is a great humanist. The poet focuses his attention on a man as a complex of sincere feelings, emotions, passions and aspirations. To counterbalance the mentality of the Middle Ages and the ecclesiastic morality of asceticism, Rustaveli proclaims the freedom of man as a personality, free of thought and feeling.

===Love===
In the prologue, Rustaveli describes three types of love: inaccessible, heavenly love; physical love; and finally, a higher earthly love, or passionate love. Rustaveli thinks that pure and constant love does not expect love in return. Such love can not be felt without a strong spirit; he suggests that the only possibility of enjoying love of this order is to have the natural qualities of a true human being. The valiant must win his beauty by impeccable behavior, including a constant devotion, the rejection of social duties, and selfless loyalty. And as the author says, &quot;love is a severe trial for man as for woman&quot;.

Nestan&#x27;s loyalty is expressed in the dramatic tension well before the appearance of her character; She is a model of righteousness. When it was announced that Nestan would be married against her will, she protests with force, and supports the consequences by her heroic courage and stoicism. For the three heroes who go to her aid, fearless and selfless, their fight is intended as a quest for justice. Amorous conquest is noticeably absent from the poem. Both romantic relationships are paralleled and never mixed, as the true brotherhood between the two heroes prevent such incidents. Love, like friendship, often gives rise to hyperbolic descriptions in the poem.

===Friendship===
The friendship between the three heroes sworn, Avtandil, Tariel and Pridon, a clear narrative of the entire epic, binds them together and at the same time it binds their peoples. These three men belong to different nations, they find themselves with the same aspirations and the same goal and that is their union of forces that can and will destroy a tyranny and evil what is represented by the Kajs. This friendship, full of honesty and courage, free of cowardice and sycophancy, must go to the death if necessary. Such friendship is also possible between persons of different sexes in this case of Tariel and Asmat who share the same cave in brotherhood. However, love and friendship are intertwined as love of a knight with his heroism is fully realized with the help of a disinterested friendship and absolute loyalty. Both feelings are also expressed in the terms when Avtandil even against the will and order of his king departs to help his friend in need. Moreover, the happiness of each is conditioned by the happiness of others. Tinatin allows Avtandil to leave for Tariel, because it is the duty of her suitor to rescue his friend to whom he has promised to help.

==Morals, religion and philosophy==

===Values===
With the glorification of courtly love, Rustaveli leads to strongly condemn forced marriages. The poem also shows an admiration for the woman and demands for gender equality. Even though Queen Tamar is the first female monarch and the sovereign of the kingdom, women&#x27;s political function, position and leading role in Georgia was very high be it the patronage of Georgia by the Virgin Mary or conversion of Georgians to Christianity by a woman, Saint Nino in the 4th century. This &quot;cult of woman&quot; celebrates her honor and freedom to choose her own husband and Nestan is the model of a noble woman who puts reason above passion. In equal rights, women can develop a sincere friendship with the opposite sex without love and desire and Asmat is dedicated to Tariel. Slavery is also condemned in the poem.

Politically, the poem does not lack and is not without patriotism. The state must be led by a strong and autocratic central government, however, sovereigns must rule with justice and prudence.

In general, the poem is a &quot;manifest of living with joy&quot;. The success of the three heroes in the liberation of Nestan shows that justice can exist on earth, as with enough courage and perseverance, one can find the happiness here.

===Religious and philosophical views===
The poem sometimes gives the impression of being a pagan work. In fact, there are no prayers in the poem, and no references to Christ, the Virgin Mary, or the Trinity. However, Paul the Apostle is mentioned, and there are a number of references to the Gospels and the Old Testament, including ten occurrences of the Garden of Eden, as well as references to the Euphrates, Gibeon and Levi).

Nevertheless, the moral framework of the work is Christian, with a clear dichotomy between a good god and a hard and disappointing world. This Christianity is not, however, fanatical. Rustaveli refers to the Quran multiple times to indicate that most of the characters are Muslim. He never offends Islam in his work and uses it as an allegory for Christianity, since most of the values that the poem promotes are of Christian origin. He also mentions the twelve apostles (verse 799) and how they spread the philosophy of benevolence and love.

There are philosophical references in the poem to the work of Pseudo-Dionysius (verse 1478) which may be attributed to the influence of the Georgian monk Peter the Iberian, an idealist, who believed in the oneness of God but sees the impossibility of knowing God&#x27;s real existence. Rustaveli&#x27;s presentation of God as a universal force rather than only a Christian one once led to the suppression of the poem. Believing Rustaveli was a Muslim (an opinion also proffered by Nicholas Marr in 1917), the Georgian Orthodox Church in the past systematically destroyed copies of the poem.

==Translations==

Within Georgia, the poem has been translated into other Kartvelian languages like Laz, Svan and Mingrelian.

Outside of Georgia, interest in the poem first appeared in 1802, when Eugene Bolkhovitinov published a verbatim translation of the first stanza of the poem into Russian. In France in 1828, Marie-Félicité Brosset made his first partial French translation. In the 19th century the poem saw full translations into Polish, German and Russian. In 1845, extracts were published in Russian, French and Armenian. Vahan Terian, a prominent Georgian-born Armenian poet, translated the prelude, which was first published posthumously in 1922. It was praised by Nicholas Marr. In 1912, Marjory Wardrop published the first English translation available. In 1968, a verse translation by Venera Urushadze was published in Georgia. It was also translated into modern Azerbaijani in 1978 by Dilara Aliyeva. In 2015, an English poetic translation by Lyn Coffin was published, combining literary achievement with academic precision.

Today, unabridged editions are available in many languages: Abkhaz, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Bashkir, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Chechen, Chinese, Chuvash, Czech, Esperanto, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Kazakh, Korean, Kurdish, Kyrgyz, Moldovan, Mongolian, Ossetian, Persian, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Tatar, Turkmen, Ukrainian, Hindi, and Uzbek.

Among the translations, the 1989 Esperanto version by Zurab Makaŝvili and the 2015 English version by Lyn Coffin are notable not only for faithfully reproducing the content of the poem, but also for preserving the poetic structure of the epic in shairi (rhymed stanzas of four sixteen-syllable lines).

<text>Newberry Volcano is a large, active, shield-shaped stratovolcano located about south of Bend, Oregon, United States, east of the major crest of the Cascade Range, within the Newberry National Volcanic Monument. Its highest point is Paulina Peak. Newberry is the largest volcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, with an area of when its lava flows are taken into account. From north to south, the volcano has a length of , with a width of and a total volume of approximately . It was named for the geologist and surgeon John Strong Newberry, who explored central Oregon for the Pacific Railroad Surveys in 1855.

The volcano contains a large caldera, in diameter, known as the Newberry Caldera. Within the caldera are two lakes: Paulina Lake and East Lake. The volcano and its vicinity include many pyroclastic cones, lava flows and lava domes; Newberry has more than 400 vents, the most of any volcano in the contiguous United States. Glaciers may have once been present at the volcano, though this remains contested. The area has a dry climate with low precipitation levels and little surface runoff.

The origin of the volcano remains somewhat unclear; while some scientists believe it originated from an independent hotspot, most evidence indicates that it formed from the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca and Gorda tectonic plates under the continental North American Plate. Eruptive activity at Newberry Volcano began about 600,000 years ago and has continued into the Holocene, the last eruption taking place 1,300 years ago. Unlike other shield-shaped volcanoes, which often erupt basaltic lavas only, Newberry Volcano has also erupted andesitic and rhyolitic lavas. A popular destination for hiking, fishing, boating, and other recreational activities, the volcano lies within of 16,400 people and within of nearly 200,000 people, and it continues to pose a threat to life. Still considered an active volcano, it could erupt and produce lava flows, pyroclastic flows, lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows), ashfall, earthquakes, avalanches, and floods. To track this threat, the volcano and its surroundings are closely monitored with sensors by the United States Geological Survey.

== Geography ==

The center of Newberry Volcano lies to the south of the city of Bend, at the intersection of Deschutes, Klamath and Lake counties in Oregon, where it is one of the most accessible volcanoes in the state. It is the largest volcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc at , and has roughly the same area as the state of Rhode Island at if its lava flows are included. Newberry lies east of the major crest of the Cascade Range in the High Lava Plains region, rising above its surroundings. From north to south, the volcano runs for a length of , with a width of and a total volume of about . Because of its enormous size and topographic prominence, it is often confused for an entire mountain range.

Newberry Volcano has a somewhat dry climate due to its location in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range. Climate data for the Newberry National Volcanic Monument are collected at the Lava Butte cinder cone, which had an average annual precipitation of from 2002 to 2012. Summer temperatures average from , dipping to average minimum and maximum temperatures of during the winter season. Spring has average temperatures of , while fall temperatures average . Each year, total precipitation consisting of winter snow and summer rain varies from in the highest parts of the region, and surface runoff rarely occurs even during heavy rain showers. Only one stream appears on Newberry&#x27;s entire surface, and it remains unclear whether the volcano has ever been able to support glaciers on its slopes, since the mountain lacks cirques (amphitheater-like valleys formed by glacial erosion) or evidence of contact between lava and ice. However, displaced glacial erratics have been found far from their native areas, moraine sediment has been deposited on the eastern and northeastern slopes of the volcano, and the mountain&#x27;s various cone features have &quot;boat&quot; shapes that indicate glacial alteration. The precise history of glaciers on the volcano is debated, but dry channels and dry waterfalls on the eastern and western slopes are evidence that the volcano once held water.
The volcano has two crater lakes, Paulina Lake and East Lake, which are filled by precipitation and percolation of ground water. Paulina Lake occupies an area of and reaches a maximum depth of , and it is separated from East Lake by a narrow isthmus, which is composed of rhyolite lava. East Lake has a smaller area of with a maximum depth of . The lakes have historically flooded channels surrounding the volcano. A large flood between 4,000 and 2,300 years ago released up to 12,000 acre feet (0.0148 km3) in volume from Paulina Lake, filling the valley floor above the Paulina Prairie, which surrounds the lake. It was possibly caused by the failure of a rock ledge in height, rather than eruptive activity. Another flood took place in 1909 on the Deschutes River downstream from where it meets its tributary the Little Deschutes River.

== Ecology ==

The Newberry National Volcanic Monument forms part of the northern section of the Mazama Ecological Province, which has soil comprised by aeolian pumice and volcanic products over basalt bedrock. Flora within the Newberry Volcano area includes forests of juniper, whitebark pine, ponderosa pine (including Oregon&#x27;s largest ponderosa pine tree), lodgepole pine, jack pine, and white fir, in addition to other plants like Indian paintbrush, purple penstemon, bitterbrush, manzanita, and snowbrush. Infestations by mountain pine beetles have killed many lodgepole pines in the area. Animals near Newberry Volcano include burrowing owls, kangaroo rats, lizards, bats, rattlesnakes, eagles, porcupines, otters, bobcats, mule deer, Roosevelt elk, ducks, and American pika.

Lava flows from Newberry display varied vegetation cover, and there are variable levels of flora between flows, though the level of vegetation and species diversity generally increase with elevation. Dominant plant species on lava flows include oceanspray and wax currant, with rabbitbrush also common. Though forbs are not widespread on the lava flows, where they do occur Davidson&#x27;s penstemon and hotrock penstemon dominate. Above elevations of , roundleaf alumroot is common, particularly near the edges of lava flows. All lava flows support patches of grasses such as Idaho fescue, especially on north-facing slopes. One lava flow at Lava Butte is barren except for scattered, dense patches of greenleaf manzanita.

The Lava Cast Forest is a group of trees molded by lava from an eruption 6,000 years ago. Today, the surrounding site lies within the Newberry National Volcanic Monument and includes 11 kīpukas, plots of land surrounded by one or more younger lava flows. These habitat islands range from in area and sustain forests that have not been significantly altered by humans other than nearby fire suppression and land management efforts. Consisting of pure and mixed forest stands, these forests include ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and grand fir/white fir hybrid trees, which are supported by young soils derived from Mazama pumice.

== Geology ==
Overlapping with the northwestern corner of the Basin and Range Province, also known as the High Lava Plains, Newberry Volcano lies within a Cenozoic highland marked by normal faults known as the Brothers Fault Zone. It is situated at the intersection of the Brothers Fault Zone with the north–northwest-trending Sisters and northeast-trending Walker Rim fault zones. In the mantle under Newberry Volcano, P and S seismic waves exhibit an unusually low wave velocity. The Earth&#x27;s crust thins from at the nearby Three Sisters volcano complex to near Newberry, where it has a high Poisson&#x27;s ratio.

The oldest rocks in this region include silicic (rich in silica) lava domes from the late Miocene or early Pliocene, which lie near the province&#x27;s eastern and southern borders, respectively. Volcanism in this area suggests a progression of silicic eruptions, known as the Newberry Trend, that moves in a northwest-trending direction from the Harney Basin to Newberry Volcano and the rest of the Cascade Range. Newberry Volcano&#x27;s origins are somewhat controversial; some scientists think it originated from an independent hotspot, but overwhelming evidence suggests that it is part of the Cascades Arc and was produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca and Gorda tectonic plates under the continental North American Plate. However, Newberry Volcano has been transformed by tectonic processes, possibly related to subductive mechanisms that enhance melting of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. The High Lava Plains Trend, or the Newberry Trend, moves at an oblique angle to the underlying North American tectonic plate, for which subduction counterflow, gravitational flow along the lithosphere&#x27;s base, faulting, and extension of the Basin and Range Province have all been proposed as possible mechanisms. At Newberry, the subducting plate has a depth that is shallower than elsewhere in the major crest of the Cascades, accounting for its unique magmas. Newberry Volcano is likely fed by a magma chamber under the large, cauldron-like caldera at its summit. This caldera has dimensions of and formed about 75,000 years ago.

Newberry Volcano first formed about 600,000 years ago and has since been built up by several thousand eruptions. About 500,000 years ago, Mount Newberry attained an elevation of . The caldera-forming event occurred about 75,000 years ago from a major explosive eruption. It formed the crater lakes and Paulina Peak—which is the highest point on the volcano, at .

As a result of its caldera-forming eruption, Newberry has a horizontal profile, which is typical of a shield volcano. However, it is also considered a composite volcano, made up of a matrix of lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Unlike more typical composite volcanoes in the Cascades, it formed from several eruption types including more traditional explosive eruptions and more fluid effusive events; thus it is usually classified as a &quot;shield-shaped composite volcano&quot;, or shield-shaped stratovolcano. The volcano has a caldera at its summit, which has a diameter of and features two crater lakes: Paulina Lake and East Lake. This caldera, known as the Newberry Crater, is forested, with small parts of its surface covered with lava flows and pumice deposits. Before the caldera&#x27;s creation, the mountain&#x27;s summit was greater in height than its current elevation. The caldera has reformed several times throughout the volcano&#x27;s history, burying the caldera floor to a depth of and creating concentric calderas, each smaller than its predecessor. The first caldera—the volcano&#x27;s largest caldera, forming approximately 300,000 years ago—was produced by the eruption of of pyroclastic ejecta, which created the Tepee Draw tuff and ash deposits that cover the volcano&#x27;s eastern flank. The last crater formed after an explosive eruption about 80,000 years ago, which ejected up to of pyroclastic materials. Throughout this progression, the volcano shifted from rhyodacitic pumice to basaltic ash flows, the latter producing the Black Lapilli tuff that covers the western side of the volcano. Since the last caldera-forming eruption 80,000 years ago, the volcano has undergone silicic eruptions at the caldera and produced basaltic and basaltic andesite lava flows that extended down its outer flanks. The tephra and ash from the Black Lapilli tuff by the caldera formed agglutinates around its rim. Newberry Volcano is cut by several fault scarps, small step offsets on the ground surface where one side of a fault has moved vertically with respect to the other.

At the center of the isthmus that separates Newberry Volcano&#x27;s two crater lakes is the central volcanic cone, named Central Pumice cone, which reaches above East Lake. With a broad, flat top, it formed during an explosive eruption about 7,000 years ago, and sits in the center of the caldera.

Compositionally, lava from the Newberry Volcano has varied from primitive basalts with high magnesium levels to more evolved tholeiitic and calc-alkaline deposits (based on the major element characteristics of the lavas). Primitive lavas exhibit high abundances of chromium and nickel as well as variable concentrations of fluid-mobile elements like barium and strontium. Tholeiitic and calc-alkaline lavas display overlap in magnesium, calcium oxide, and aluminum oxide levels but differ in that the tholeiites have lower contents of silica and potassium oxide and higher iron(II) oxide, titanium dioxide, and sodium oxide. There is also much overlap in isotopic composition, though the tholeiitic lavas mark the low point for 87Sr/86Sr and the high point for 143Nd/144Nd and 176Hf/177Hf. Examination of Newberry lavas with olivine-plagioclase hygrometry shows that tholeiites are anhydrous (less than ) and thus distinct from calc-alkaline deposits (); both have different fractional crystallization sequences that derive from primitive magmas, which had their compositions influenced by equilibrium with peridotite in the mantle. By volume, basaltic andesite is the principal lava type at Newberry Volcano, with large volumes of silicic lava among older ash flow tuff deposits.

=== Subfeatures ===
Vents at the volcano follow north-east and north-west trends influenced by extension of the Basin and Range Province. With more than 400 vents, Newberry has more individual subfeatures than any other volcano in the contiguous United States. These include cinder cones, lava domes, and various other lava edifices, with at least 25 vents on the volcano&#x27;s flanks and summits becoming active within the past 10,000 years. Most of the cinder cones on the volcano&#x27;s edifice vary from in elevation, though a number of them reach heights above with diameters greater than . Most of these exhibit saucer-like summit depression landforms, with notable exceptions at Lava Top and North Kawak Buttes, which have craters that are in depth. Basaltic and basaltic andesite lava flows have penetrated the bases of many of these cinder cones, forming a matrix of connected flows, and a veneer of pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā lavas can be found on Newberry volcano&#x27;s northern and southern sides. The northern flank holds three distinct lava tube systems that formed out of pāhoehoe lava: the Horse Lava Tube System (also known as the Horse System), Arnold Lava Tube System, and the Lava Top Butte basalt.

About 7,000 years ago, at Newberry&#x27;s Northwest Rift Zone, lava fountains erupted from a fissure with a length of , yielding basaltic and andesitic lava flows. Strombolian eruptions (which eject incandescent cinder, lapilli, and lava bombs) produced tephra that formed Lava Butte, a cinder cone near Newberry with a height of , a base diameter of , and a crater depth of . With a lopsided shape where the northeastern rim is taller than the southwestern counterpart, this cinder cone sits south of Bend.

The nearby Badlands shield volcano, which formed out of a rootless vent to produce a large basaltic lava flow at Newberry, has a diameter of . It has pāhoehoe lava throughout its surface, with tumuli (mounds of earth and stones) and a pit crater.

Dacite and rhyodacite domes can be found on the middle and upper flanks, and Newberry also features twenty rhyolitic lava domes and lava flows among its western, eastern, and southern flanks. These include East Butte and China Hat at the eastern base of the volcano, which date to 850,000 and 780,000 years ago, and therefore predate Newberry. The McKay Butte, found on the volcano&#x27;s western side, formed 580,000 years ago. Other Holocene eruptions have produced rhyolite lava that remained close to the summit, including Paulina Peak, which has a width of one mile and reaches within of the wall of the caldera.

Hot springs can be found at Paulina Lake and East Lake, along with one fumarole gas vent at Lost Lake, located near the Big Obsidian lava flow. These discharge gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide and give off a rotten smell, though the composition has few noxious components.

== Eruptive history ==
During the late Pleistocene, Newberry Volcano produced a number of voluminous lava flows, made of basalt, which originated from several vents on its northern flank and reached the modern areas of Bend and Redmond. They filled canyons that served as precursors for the Deschutes and Crooked rivers–since eroded–and extended tens of miles from the volcano. Lava from the last of these eruptions about 78,000 years ago covered the Bend area, surrounded the Pilot Butte cinder cone, and filled the Deschutes River bed.

In addition to its production of large lava flows, Newberry Volcano has also produced a number of Plinian eruptions similar to the eruption of Vesuvius that destroyed Pompeii and Peléan eruptions like the 1902 explosion of Mount Pelée. These include a number of caldera-forming eruptions, producing ash flow deposits including the Tepee Draw tuff and Black Lapilli tuff, and rising or more into the stratosphere. The last of these eruptions covered tens of thousands of square miles with ash, extending to the San Francisco Bay Area in California nearly to the southwest. Here, it reaches a thickness of one centimeter. Additionally, Newberry has produced multiple, voluminous explosive eruptions, with certain studies estimating up to 60 eruptive events of rhyolite and dacite tephra that reach Idaho, Utah, and northern California. These include the eruption that produced the Paulina Creek tephra between 55,000 and 50,000 years ago, and the eruption from 20,000 years ago responsible for the Wono tephra, which extends into western Nevada and east-central California. As a result of compositional zoning within the magma chamber that feeds the volcano, its ash deposits may show different chemical and mineralogical makeups. The last of these tephra eruptions yielded the Newberry pumice just before 1,300 years ago, reaching several hundred miles to the east.

Between the last Ice Age about 12,000 years ago and 7,700 years ago, the volcano erupted at least 12 times. Mount Mazama erupted 7,700 years ago, producing volcanic ash and pumice that accumulated to a thickness of up to on the Newberry Volcano, covering many of the lava flows on its slopes. During three eruptive periods at Newberry over the past 7,500 years, the caldera has seen rhyolitic eruptions from seven individual vents. About 7,000 years ago, eruptions occurred along the rift zone northwest of Newberry Volcano&#x27;s caldera, yielding 12 lava flows that encompassed an area of . At about the same time, the Central Pumice cone was produced by eruptions that also formed the Interlake and Game Hut obsidian flows from a vent on the cone&#x27;s southern flank. An eruption from a fissure zone at East Lake, 3,500 years ago, yielded tephra and formed the East Lake obsidian lava flows.

The volcano underwent its most recent eruptions 1,300 years ago, producing the Big Obsidian flow. A silicic deposit, it is made up of rhyolite and features a number of lava blocks. Although it is frequently cited as the largest Holocene obsidian formation in the United States, its area of and volume of actually place it fifth in the nation. The eruptions, which were both explosive and effusive, began with a Plinian explosion of pumice and tephra that covered the caldera&#x27;s eastern half and reached several hundred miles to the east. This deposit, called the Newberry pumice, reaches a thickness of up to from the vent that produced it, which is located at the southern flank of the caldera, and a thickness of up to from the volcano. Because of strong westerly winds, tephra reached as far east as Idaho. This eruption also produced pyroclastic flows that left volcanic bombs in Paulina Lake.

=== Recent activity and current threats ===

Though Newberry Volcano is currently quiet, the United States Geological Survey considers it an active volcano with a &quot;very high&quot; threat level. Hot springs within the caldera remain active, and small earthquakes have occurred within recent local history. Any future eruptions would likely show similar characteristics to eruptions from the past 15,000 years, ranging from effusive production of lava flows to explosive eruptions ejecting pumice and ash. If future lava flows from Newberry Volcano are of comparable size to its late Pleistocene eruptions, they would bury settlements throughout the Central Oregon region. They would also likely destroy segments of U.S. Route 97, disabling transportation in the area, in addition to likely ruining gas pipelines and power lines that extend electricity to California, both of which would be accompanied by serious economic consequences.

Flank lava flows, which would likely be basaltic in origin, might form lava fountains that could scatter cinders and lava for several thousand meters, building cinder cones or initiating forest fires. While the flows themselves move at rates of per minute, and thus could be escaped by animals and humans, they would destroy stationary structures in their paths. Pyroclastic flows, on the other hand, travel at speeds of , and their violent force could incinerate or pulverize objects in their path, or asphyxiate living things.

If another caldera-forming eruption of similar magnitude to previous ones at the volcano occurred, pyroclastic flows could devastate the area surrounding the volcano for up to . However, pyroclastic flows have been rare at Newberry. Tephra from explosive eruptions would short-circuit electric transformers and power lines, clog engine filters, produce clouds that might yield lightning, and pose a hazard to aircraft overhead. It would also pose health hazards because ash particles can irritate eyes, and when ingested, lungs, among other health issues. Because of water from the two crater lakes, eruptions at Newberry Volcano may become more explosive and more likely to produce pyroclastic flows. Moreover, if pyroclastic flows mix with snow or water overflowing from the crater lakes, they could spawn lahars, volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows that could devastate the Paulina Creek valley and reach the La Pine valley within 30 minutes. Threats from the volcano pose hazards to about 16,400 people who live within and more than 180,000 people living within .

In addition to threats from volcanic activity, at least one flood has taken place at Newberry Volcano in the past, though it may not have been a result of eruptive activity. If lava flows from an eruption blocked the Deschutes River, they might generate floods upstream by increasing water level and downstream once the blockage clears. Earthquakes unrelated to volcanic activity also take place in Oregon, though they are usually less than 2.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. Volcanoes can also cause earthquakes reaching magnitudes up to 5 on the Richter scale, which sometimes occur as swarms. These clusters of tremors cause shaking of houses, walls, and windows and can crack plaster or walls in older buildings but rarely cause major damage. Powerful earthquakes close to magnitude 7 would cause damage independently, but they would not cause Newberry Volcano to erupt unless it were already on the verge of activity. Additional threats exist for rockfalls and avalanches.

If Newberry Volcano were to erupt, it should be possible to detect increased seismic activity, while increased production of volcanic gas would likely kill trees near the volcano, which scientists would quickly recognize before notifying emergency management agencies. Before 2011, Newberry was monitored by just one seismic station that had been installed in 1987 and had only detected seven earthquakes within of the volcano. In 2011, scientists from the Cascades Volcano Observatory installed eight more seismic and deformation monitors in the volcano&#x27;s vicinity, which has seen the number of detectable earthquakes rise to 10–15 per year. The volcano continues to be closely monitored by the United States Geological Survey, which monitors a seismometer network with the geophysics program at the University of Washington and regularly conducts leveling surveys to check for deformation that could suggest impending activity, in addition to sampling geothermal areas. There are GPS instruments installed within the volcano&#x27;s vicinity to monitor any swelling that occurs as a result of underground movement of magma. Despite historical uplift at the volcano, deformation has remained continuously low in recent years.

== Human history ==
The area around Newberry Volcano has been inhabited by Native American peoples for more than 10,000 years, though only intermittently as a result of eruptive activity at the volcano and in the surrounding area. During an archaeological excavation near Paulina Lake in 1992, researchers discovered remnants of a central hearth and a housing structure with support posts and linear rock arrangements with dimensions of . Radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples from the site were dated to 11,000 years ago. The mountain&#x27;s caldera was used to harvest obsidian, which they used to sharpen arrowheads and tools and traded throughout the Pacific Coast region for several thousand years.

The first recorded European to visit the volcano was Peter Skene Ogden, a trapper who reached the crater in 1826. In 1855, the volcano&#x27;s namesake, John Strong Newberry, a surgeon and geologist for the Williamson and Abbot survey party, visited central Oregon while mapping the local area for the Pacific Railroad, but never visited the volcano. Paulina Lake, Paulina Creek, and Paulina Peak are named after Paulina, a Snake Indian chief who headed raiding parties against whites during the 1850s and 1860s before he was pursued and shot by settler Howard Maupin. Near the end of the 19th century, the Lava River Cave was used by the hunter Leander Dillman to store perishable foods. The name Mount Newberry was proposed by Israel Russell, who visited the area in 1903, though the name did not come into use. Instead, it was known as Newberry Crater until it was renamed to the Newberry Volcano in the 1930s by geologist Howel Williams, a name which was formally accepted in 2003 when geologist Larry Chitwood supported it through the official geographic naming process.

Because of the efforts of Hollis Dole, head of the Oregon Department of Geology, to promote the area, in 1963 NASA scientists became interested in using lava fields at Newberry to prepare for the United States&#x27; first Moon landing. NASA used the area in October 1964 and July 1966 to geologically train the Apollo Astronauts in recognizing volcanic features, such as cinder and pumice cones, lava flows, ash and obsidian flows, and a lava tube. Astronauts who would use this training on the Moon included Apollo 11&#x27;s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 12&#x27;s Alan Bean, Apollo 14&#x27;s Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 15&#x27;s James Irwin, and Apollo 16&#x27;s Charlie Duke. Notable geologist instructors included Aaron Waters.

The Newberry National Volcanic Monument was established in November 1990 by the United States Congress. With an area of more than , it forms a near-circular shape around the summit caldera and then a long corridor from the mountain&#x27;s northwestern side to the Deschutes River that includes a rift zone. The Monument lies within the Deschutes National Forest, which is managed by the United States Forest Service. As of 1997, the caldera area of Newberry holds seven campgrounds, two resort areas, and six summer houses.

=== Mining and geothermal energy ===
Because Newberry has had recent eruptive activity, has remained active for a long time, and has a shallow heat source feeding hot springs, it represents a source of geothermal energy. An investigation conducted by the United States Geological Survey in 1981 drilled a well in depth at a location to the east of the Big Obsidian flow, finding temperatures of under the surface there. An energy company drilled two holes with a depth of in 1995 and 1996, but they were unable to find fluids, so they lacked a mechanism to drive turbines and opted to end the project at Newberry. According to many scientists, Newberry Volcano represents the best geothermal energy candidate in the Pacific Northwest; in 2012, a deep well was built to determine whether water directed into the hole might be heated and returned to the surface in order to yield energy.

== Recreation ==
Newberry Volcano is visited by 250,000 people each year, who come to go fishing for trout in East Lake, to camp on Paulina Lake, or go mountain biking around the loop that surrounds the crater. The lakes are also popular for boating. At the Newberry National Volcanic Monument, camping, fishing, and hiking are popular, including on the Trail of the Molten Land, which follows a 7,000-year-old lava flow from Lava Butte, and the Trail of the Whispering Pines, which traverses a ponderosa pine forest. Horse riding is also possible in a section of the Peter Skene Ogden Trail, long, which runs through the monument area; snowmobiling and cross-country skiing are also popular.

The Lava Lands Visitor Center within the Monument has an exhibit on the area&#x27;s geology and culture and offers a paved path that runs for . A shuttle leaves from the center every 20 minutes during the peak season from Memorial Day through Labor Day, costing $2 per traveler. The area can also be accessed by personal motorized vehicles during off season with a permit from the visitor center, and the center&#x27;s parking area remains open year-round. The area offers eight campgrounds operated by the United States Forest Service.

The last lava flow from Newberry during the Pleistocene formed the Lava River Cave, to the south of Bend. This feature is the state&#x27;s longest continuous lava tube, which can be hiked for more than one mile to the north and west and has an arching ceiling with a thickness of . This trail represents the monument&#x27;s most popular attraction and can be hiked between May and mid-September with a recreation day pass that costs $5. Jackets are recommended, as the temperature within the cave is usually . The Lava Cast Forest, a group of trees molded by lava from an eruption 6,000 years ago, covers an area of and can be observed from a paved, narrow, and steep one-mile trail. The area was designated as the Lava Cast Forest Geological Area in April 1942 by the United States Forest Service, which included of land in the region. Known to the American public since 1928, by the mid-1940s the Lava Cast Forest was visited by thousands of tourists each year. In the mid-1970s, the region had 150,000 tourist visitors annually, with the Lava Lands Visitors Center built by the Forest Service in September 1975.

The trail to the volcano&#x27;s summit at Paulina Peak lasts from Highway 97, with an easy paved road to the caldera and four rest stops, though it grows steep and twisty near the end. The winding trail near the end is made of gravel and lasts for three miles, offering views of Mount Hood, Mount McLoughlin, and the Three Sisters volcanoes.

<text>Mount Jefferson is a stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, part of the Cascade Range in the U.S. state of Oregon. The second highest mountain in Oregon, it is situated within Linn County, Jefferson County, and Marion County and forms part of the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. Due to the ruggedness of its surroundings, the mountain is one of the hardest volcanoes to reach in the Cascades. It is also a popular tourist destination despite its remoteness, with recreational activities including hiking, backpacking, mountaineering, and photography. Vegetation at Mount Jefferson is dominated by Douglas fir, silver fir, mountain hemlock, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and several cedar species. Carnivores, insectivores, bats, rodents, deer, birds, and various other species inhabit the area.

Also known as Seekseekqua by Native American populations, the volcano was named after United States President Thomas Jefferson, and was first ascended by E. C. Cross and R. L. Farmer in 1888. It sits atop an area of crustal melting, and was produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the continental North American tectonic plate, forming about 730,000 years ago. Consisting of basaltic andesite, andesite, and dacite, the mountain has been extensively altered by glacial erosion. The surrounding area contains a number of other volcanic features like cinder cones, shield volcanoes, and tuyas (flat-topped, steep-sided volcanoes formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet). It is considered a low threat by the United States Geological Survey. Despite the low chance of future eruptions, many scientists still consider mudflows a major threat at Mount Jefferson.

== Geography ==
The second tallest mountain in the U.S. state of Oregon after Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson lies within Jefferson, Linn, and Marion counties, in the central part of the state. Reaching an elevation of , the volcano has a proximal relief of . It is not usually visible from the city of Portland, though it is visible on clear days from Salem and can be noticed from highways to both the east and the west of the Cascade Range. The average elevation of the terrain around Jefferson is , meaning that Jefferson&#x27;s cone rises nearly above its surroundings.

=== Wilderness ===
Mount Jefferson&#x27;s eastern segment lies within the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, and its western portion within the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, of the Willamette National Forest and Deschutes National Forests. The wilderness area covers , with more than 150 lakes. It also has of trails, including of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail. Mount Jefferson is the major feature of the wilderness, along with the nearby Three Fingered Jack volcano.

=== Physical geography ===
Mount Jefferson lies in the temperate maritime climate of Western Oregon. The Cascades absorb east-moving moisture, causing warm and dry summers. Winters show higher precipitation levels, especially at higher elevations, averaging at peak altitudes and consisting mostly of snow. Moving east, annual precipitation levels decrease from to lower than .

When Little Ice Age glaciers retreated during the 20th century, water filled in the spaces left behind, forming moraine-dammed lakes, which are more common in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness and the nearby Three Sisters Wilderness than anywhere else in the contiguous United States. A number of these lakes breached during the 20th century and inundated Jefferson Park and the Jefferson Creek drainage under Waldo Glacier. These breach events yielded floods and small lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows). The flood on August 21, 1934, at a lake formed near Whitewater Glacier, created a debris flow that reached the Whitewater River drainage and buried parts of Jefferson Park in of debris; another event took place in 1957, but was poorly documented.

Mount Jefferson has 35 snow and ice features, including four named glaciers: Whitewater, Jefferson Park, Russell, and Waldo. These features, for the most part on the northern, eastern, and southeastern parts of Mount Jefferson, span elevations from and cover an area of . The volcano, like much of the Oregon Cascades, was likely covered by an ice cap during the Pleistocene, with the glaciers at their peak size between 25,000 and 20,000 years ago. In recent years, the glaciers have retreated to form lateral moraines; Whitewater Glacier, for example, shrunk from in width and in length to in width and a length of . During the 20th century, scientists thought they had identified a new glacier, which they named Milk Creek Glacier, but later studies established that it was an artifact of stagnant ice that had been hidden by debris, and it is no longer considered its own distinct feature.

Other geographic features at Jefferson include rock outcrops, steep talus slopes, conifer forests, and alpine meadows. Additionally, a number of rivers drain Mount Jefferson. The northern and northwestern slopes feed the South Fork Breitenbush River, which flows into Detroit Lake, and the eastern side of Detroit Lake also receives water from Whitewater Creek, Russell Creek, and Milk Creek, which flow from the western flank of Mount Jefferson. The Whitewater Glacier and the northeastern side of the volcano drain into the Whitewater River, and Shitike Creek flows between Mount Jefferson and Olallie Butte before reaching the Deschutes River. Both Jefferson and Parker Creeks receive water from Jefferson&#x27;s southeastern slopes, then join the Metolius River.

Wildfires occur within the wilderness area at Mount Jefferson. In the late summer to early fall of 2017, the Whitewater and Little Devil fires occurred. While the Little Devil fire covered , the Whitewater fire reached more than in area, provoking the use of amphibious aircraft and causing trail closures. As a result of the Whitewater fire, officials closed the Mount Jefferson Wilderness during the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017.

==Climate==
== Ecology ==
Vegetation at Mount Jefferson is dominated by Douglas fir, silver fir, mountain hemlock, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and several species of cedar. Vine maple, rhododendron, purple lupine, yellow lupine, Indian paintbrush, wild strawberries, and red huckleberries are also common around Mount Jefferson. Above the timber line at above sea level, mountain hemlock and whitebark pine predominate, though mountain hemlock has also invaded into subalpine meadows at Mount Jefferson, possibly as a result of fire control programs, grazing, the influence of adjacent forest areas, and climate change.

Carnivorous animals at Mount Jefferson and its surroundings include American black bears, coyotes, cougars, red foxes, raccoons, American martens, stoats (also known as ermines), long-tailed weasels, American minks, North American river otters, and bobcats. Deer species include Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer; insectivores include vagrant shrews, American water shrews, and coast moles. Bats at Jefferson include little brown bats and silver-haired bats, and American pikas and snowshoe hares are also present. Rodents such as yellow-bellied marmots, mountain beavers, yellow-pine chipmunks, Townsend&#x27;s chipmunks, golden-mantled ground squirrels, western gray squirrels, Douglas squirrels, mountain pocket gophers, North American beavers, deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, water voles, Pacific jumping mice, and North American porcupines are present.

Birds at Jefferson include mallards, northern goshawks, sharp-shinned hawks, red-tailed hawks, dusky grouses, grey partridges, killdeers, spotted sandpipers, California gulls, band-tailed pigeons, great horned owls, mountain pygmy owls, common nighthawks, rufous hummingbirds, Northern flickers, pileated woodpeckers, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, hairy woodpeckers, and white-headed woodpeckers. Other bird species found in the area consist of Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, willow flycatchers, olive-sided flycatchers, tree swallows, Canada jays, Steller&#x27;s jays, common ravens, Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers, black-capped chickadees, mountain chickadees, chestnut-backed chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, pygmy nuthatches, Eurasian treecreepers, American dippers, wrens, American robins, varied thrushes, hermit thrushes, Townsend&#x27;s solitaires, golden-crowned kinglets, ruby-crowned kinglets, water pipits, blue-headed vireos, western tanagers, Cassin&#x27;s finches, gray-crowned rosy finches, pine siskins, red crossbills, green-tailed towhees, dark-eyed juncos, white-crowned sparrows, golden-crowned sparrows, fox sparrows, and Lincoln&#x27;s sparrows. Long-toed salamanders, California giant salamanders, rough-skinned newts, tailed frogs, western toads, Pacific tree frogs, northern red-legged frogs, Oregon spotted frogs, pygmy short-horned lizards, common garter snakes, and northwestern garter snakes make up some of the amphibious and reptilian animals in the vicinity. Roughly half the lakes in the Jefferson area contain rainbow trout.

== Geology ==
Mount Jefferson shows normal magnetic polarity, suggesting that it formed less than 730,000 years ago. Created by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the continental North American tectonic plate in an area where the Earth&#x27;s crust is thick, it is part of the Oregon High Cascades, which are influenced by the movement of the North American Plate and the extension of its continental crust. These extensional processes formed grabens, or valley-like depressions between parallel fault lines, at the eastern boundary of the central Cascades, including a deep formation. Jefferson does not lie in one of these grabens, but these tectonic processes continue, albeit at a less dramatic rate. At their peak rates, the crustal extension and depression of the Cascades area caused eruption of the Minto Lavas, made of basalt, followed by the Santiam basalts, named for their movement into the North Santiam River valley, which they filled to depths of . Though the Jefferson vicinity has produced andesitic and dacitic lavas for the past 5 to 6 million years, major volcanoes more than south of the area have erupted basaltic andesite.

The central Oregon Cascades are made up of Eocene to Quaternary volcanic, volcaniclastic, igneous, and sedimentary rock. Miocene and Pliocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks have been exposed in the Jefferson area, which also sits above lava flows, cinder material, and breccia from the High Cascades that formed during and after the Pliocene. Jefferson is the largest volcano in the Jefferson Reach, which forms the strip that makes up the northern part of the Oregon Cascade Range. Stretching from Frog Lake Buttes to South Cinder Peak, this segment consists of at least 175 Quaternary volcanoes. With a width of , it differs from the adjacent northern segment of the Cascades, where volcanoes show a scattered distribution. Other unusual features of the Jefferson Reach include that the northernmost of the strip does not contain many volcanoes formed since the early Pleistocene and that it features a number of andesitic and dacitic volcanoes, which are unlike the many mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) shield volcanoes within the stretch. North of Pinhead Buttes, the volcanoes in this region are older and less tall, usually between in elevation. South of Pinhead Buttes, the Cascades becomes younger Pleistocene volcanoes, which often have glaciers.

Mount Jefferson may form part of a long-lasting intracrustal melting and magma storage area that encompasses an area of , where relatively little mafic eruptive activity has occurred. The melting of the metamorphic rocks amphibolite and at deeper strata, granulite, have both produced intermediate and silicic lavas at Jefferson. The strip may still be active, as monogenetic vents near Jefferson have produced basaltic andesite since the last glacial period. Jefferson — with Mount Hood, the Three Sisters-Broken Top area, and Crater Lake — represents one of four volcanic centers responsible for much of the Oregon Cascades&#x27; Quaternary andesite, dacite, and rhyolite deposits. Some of this andesite and dacite occurs in vents that underlie the Jefferson vicinity, which also erupted during the Quaternary. Quaternary volcanic production rates in the Cascade Range from Jefferson to Crater Lake have averaged per mile of arc length per million years.

In the area surrounding Mount Jefferson, monogenetic volcanoes constructed an upland area composed of basaltic lava flows and small volcanic vents. Within this region, basaltic vents occur at Olallie Butte, Potato Butte, Sisi Butte, North Cinder Peak, and South Cinder Peak, with basaltic lava flows at Cabot Creek, Jefferson Creek, and upper Puzzle Creek. There are several hundred other basaltic volcanoes within the central Oregon High Cascades, extending up to away. Mount Jefferson overlies an silicic volcanic field from the early Pleistocene.
 Between five and six million years old, the field reaches north from Jefferson to Olallie Butte, and it covers an area of . Scientists think that the setup of this field, where various vents have erupted lava, explains why the otherwise similar Cascades volcano at Mount Hood is three times as voluminous as Jefferson, because Hood has concentrated most of the eruptions from its magma chambers. The field is also likely underlain by a batholith, a large mass of intrusive igneous rock (also called a pluton) that forms from cooled magma deep in the Earth&#x27;s crust.

Mount Jefferson is a stratovolcano, made up of basaltic andesite, andesite, and dacite overlying basaltic shield volcanoes, with andesite and more silicic (rich in silica) rock forming the majority of the mountain. Rhyolite from the Quaternary can also be found at Jefferson, though it is not commonly found within the major volcanic centers of the Oregon Cascades. The volcano constitutes a small stratovolcano within the Cascades, with a current volume of , though prior to erosion and other alterations over time, it may have been as large as in volume at one time. Mount Jefferson has been significantly altered by erosion, and represents one of the most eroded stratovolcanoes in the state of Oregon. Glacial motion during the Pleistocene decreased the summit&#x27;s elevation by a few hundred feet and formed a cirque (an amphitheatre-like valley carved by glacial erosion) on the western side of the volcano. This feature, known as the West Milk Creek cirque, includes the two Milk Creek glaciers and extends into the interior of Mount Jefferson, exposing tephra and pyroclastic rock in the main volcanic cone. The final two advances of glaciers during the Pleistocene removed about a third of the volcano&#x27;s original volume, decreasing the overall elevation by . Currently, the Whitewater Glacier and the Milk Creek glaciers erode the mountain&#x27;s eastern and western flanks, respectively, and are likely to gradually form a cleft between the northern and southern horns of the summit.

Within Jefferson&#x27;s main volcanic cone, more than 200 andesitic lava flows are now exposed, with mean thicknesses from , as well as an immense, pink dacitic lava flow with a thickness of . The volcano also possess a small volcanic plug (created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano), situated under the summit. Jefferson&#x27;s main cone ranges from 58 to 64 percent silicon dioxide, and is mostly made up of andesite and dacite. The upper of Jefferson&#x27;s cone formed within the past 100,000 years, and consists mostly of dacite lava flows and lava domes. While it is possible that glaciers shed material from the burgeoning lava domes, any evidence of these domes generating pyroclastic flows or lahars has not been preserved in the geological record.

Basalt at Mount Jefferson contains olivine, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase phenocryst crystals, while basaltic andesite phenocrysts include plagioclase (variable among samples), clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene, and occasionally, magnetite. Dacite and rhyodacite samples show amphibole, plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, magnetite, apatite, and every so often ilmenite. Andesite shows similar composition to dacite samples, though sodic plagioclases and amphiboles are not as common.

=== Subfeatures ===

Volcanic activity in the vicinity of Mount Jefferson tends to originate from either stratovolcanoes that erupt for thousands of years or monogenetic volcanoes, which only erupt for a brief period of time before going extinct. At least 35 volcanic vents can be detected within of the main volcanic cone at Mount Jefferson. These have produced andesitic and dacitic lava flows, lava domes, small shield volcanoes, and lava aprons. Basalt lava flows, at least two of which are younger than 7,700 years old, have been produced from four monogenetic volcanoes to the south of Jefferson, and they are not directly related to activity at the Mount Jefferson volcano. Rhyodacitic lava flows and pyroclastic material, which have since been significantly altered and stripped by glaciation, originated from eight vents in the area. The Mount Jefferson vicinity contains at least 40 of the 190 documented lava domes in the Oregon Cascades, including the tall Goat&#x27;s Peak dome; it also contains monogenetic tuyas (flat-topped, steep-sided volcanoes formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet) and emplacements of hyaloclastite among mafic lava flows.

The area is full of cinder cone volcanoes and intrusive lava plugs, which occur in irregular patterns. Made up of red to gray cinders, some are loose and agglutinated, and some contain intrusive rock plugs, while others do not. Cinder cones south of Mount Jefferson erupted lava flows, such as Forked Butte and North Cinder Peak. About 1,000 years ago, the South Cinder Peak cinder cone erupted, generating a lava flow that reached Marion Lake. Other volcanic cones associated with Mount Jefferson include Forked Butte and Horseshoe Cone.

=== Eruptive history ===
Scientists lack a comprehensive record of activity at Mount Jefferson, as important details have been obscured by the erosion of deposits by large glaciers. A few eruptions have been documented from the deposits that have been preserved, but the broad outline of Jefferson&#x27;s eruptive history is understood, including that its activity has changed over time, producing both powerful explosive eruptions and lava flows. Historically, eruptive activity has alternated between andesitic and dacitic lavas.

The volcano formed over the course of several eruptive episodes, beginning about 300,000 years ago with the formation of rocks on the western and southwestern flanks of the volcano, and lasting until roughly 15,000 years ago. The two major eruptive episodes were separated by glacial erosion of the volcano. At least during the past 700,000 years, eruptions at the volcano have produced andesitic and dacitic lava. Most of the volcano formed within the past 100,000 years, with the latest activity building the central volcanic cone taking place between 30,000 and 20,000 years ago. These eruptions took place amidst the last glacial period and indicate interaction of lava with ice. They erupted dacite lava flows and silicic lava domes from vents east of the former central cone, and were influenced by ice on Mount Jefferson, which prevented them from diffusing across the volcano&#x27;s flanks. Instead, they formed lava tongues near the crater and coursed down spaces in between glaciers, creating volcanic glass and columnar joints, or arrays of prismatic shapes. Silicic lava domes from this eruptive episode collapsed over and over again, producing block-and-ash flows, or pyroclastic flows with many volcanic blocks among ash with a similar composition.

About 150,000 years ago, an eruption produced the volcanic rock in the Park Butte area. A huge explosive eruption took place between 100,000 and 35,000 years ago (scientists have been unable to create a more specific time frame for the event), producing ash layers that covered the Metolius and Deschutes River valleys and eventually extended to the city of Arco, in the southeastern part of the state of Idaho. This eruption may have excavated the existing crater, but if that were the case, eruptions have since refilled the area and obscured evidence of a crater-forming event. Eruptions around the same time period yielded pyroclastic flows that coursed down the Whitewater River drainage of the eastern side of Mount Jefferson, and the Whitewater Creek on the volcano&#x27;s western flank.

Basaltic lava flows at Forked Butte and to the south of Bear Butte mark the newest lava flows in the Jefferson area, as both were produced after Mount Mazama erupted roughly 7,600 years ago.

The last eruption occurred about a thousand years ago at a cinder cone on the flank of the South Cinder Peak cone.

=== Recent activity and potential hazards ===
The basaltic lava flows produced from four monogenetic vents near Mount Jefferson indicate that the local region could produce future eruptions and could be considered active. Mount Jefferson itself is listed with a &quot;Low/Very Low&quot; threat potential by the United States Geological Survey, but the agency has noted that &quot;it may be too soon to regard Mount Jefferson as extinct.&quot; In a 1987 report, Richard P. Hoblitt and other USGS scientists estimated that the yearly likelihood for a major explosive eruption at Jefferson does not exceed 1 in 100,000. However, given the incomplete geologic record, imprecise dating of its known deposits, and its lack of relatively recent activity, scientists from the United States Geological Survey have commented that &quot;It is almost impossible to estimate the probability of future eruptions at Mount Jefferson.&quot; They have designated proximal and distal hazard zones for the volcano, which extend and several tens of miles, respectively.

An eruption from the volcano would threaten the immediate surrounding area, in addition to places downstream near river valleys or downwind that could be affected by ashfall. Lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows) and tephra could extend far from the volcano, and Mount Jefferson may also produce pyroclastic flows, lava domes, and lava flows. Though the population within is only about 800 people, there are more than 550,000 people living within of the volcano.

Lava flows from Mount Jefferson or another volcano nearby might form lava domes that could collapse, also yielding pyroclastic flows. Moreover, while basaltic lava flows from surrounding monogenetic vents tend to travel slowly and typically only reach from their source, and therefore would not pose serious hazards to much wildlife or humans, they would still burn and bury anything they encountered. Mazama Ash in the region reached in thickness, and at least one explosive eruption from Jefferson deposited of ash onto its surroundings within . Finer ash particles from the volcano could threaten air traffic, as a large gas plume may form; clouds from such a plume might also spawn pyroclastic flows on the flanks of the Jefferson volcano. Moreover, ash can cause irritation of the eyes or respiratory system among the ill, the elderly, and infants, potentially leading to chronic lung disease. Tephra can also lead to the short-circuiting of electric transformers and power lines, collapse roofs, clog engine filters, damage car engines, and create clouds capable of producing lightning that can start fires. Even monogenetic volcanoes in the area could yield hazardous ashfall, reaching in thickness in areas within ; it is unlikely they would threaten areas outside the local Jefferson vicinity.

An eruption at Jefferson could create lahars that would reach Detroit Lake on the western side of the volcano or Lake Billy Chinook on the eastern side, leading to increased lake water levels (or lake dam failure) and endangering life downstream. In addition to the hazards from eruptions at Mount Jefferson, other safety threats include debris avalanches and lahars, which could be caused without an eruption as a result of the failure of glacial moraine dams; this has happened in the past at Jefferson. Even a small or mid-sized landslide could create lahars that travel far from the volcano. Flooding at one of the many lakes on the flanks of Jefferson could spawn lahars in the future. Many scientists think mudflows represent the largest threat at Jefferson.

Seismic activity at Mount Jefferson is monitored by a regional network of seismic meters operated by the United States Geological Survey at the University of Washington&#x27;s Geophysics Department. No frequent signs of detectable earthquake have been seen within the past two decades, but if earthquakes increased, scientists are prepared to deploy additional seismometers and other tools to monitor volcanic gas emissions and ground deformation indicating movement of magma into the volcano.

== Human history ==
A Native American name for the mountain is Seekseekqua; its English name, Mount Jefferson (originally called Mount Vancouver by the British) was decided in honor of U.S. President Thomas Jefferson by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The expedition, which was sponsored by President Jefferson, first saw the peak from the mouth of the Willamette River on March 30, 1806. Walter Eaton later described Mount Jefferson as &quot;the most remote, the most inaccessible and alluring&quot; mountain in Oregon, writing that Jefferson and Mount Hood &quot;seem to hold mystic converse with one another over the canyons between.&quot;

Mount Jefferson&#x27;s glaciers were named by Oregon Bureau of Mines scientist Ira A. Williams in 1915, with former professor of geology at the University of Oregon, Edwin T. Hodge, publishing a report on the volcano&#x27;s glaciers and geology in 1925. His report focused on the sequence of volcanic rocks at Jefferson, in addition to its physiography and glaciology. Aerial photographic surveys of the glaciers at Jefferson were conducted by the Mazamas, a hiking club from Portland, during the 20th century. In 1937, Thayer analyzed Mount Jefferson&#x27;s petrography and petrology from segments of the Western Cascades and High Cascades, which he separated into local units. He expanded on this research in a 1939 publication looking at Jefferson vicinity lava flows. Field work followed in summer during 1965, led by G. W. Walker, and a 1974 study of the volcano&#x27;s glacial and volcanic history was carried out by Kenneth G. Sutton and other geologists.

The first ascent of Mount Jefferson was probably accomplished by E. C Cross and Ray L. Farmer on 12 August 1888 by way of the south ridge. George J. Pearce, who accompanied Cross and Farmer on the expedition, wrote an account of the climb for the &quot;Oregonian&quot; newspaper on 22 August 1900. The first climber to reach the summit via the north face was S. S. Mohler in 1903.

== Recreation ==
Mount Jefferson is remote, and can usually only be reached on foot or by horse. There are no paved roads within of the mountain, and it is relatively little-known compared to other features near the Willamette Valley. Still, the mountain and its surrounding wilderness are visited by so many hikers, backpackers, and climbers each year, especially during the summer, that they face threats to their ecological well-being. The Warm Springs Tribal Council does not permit access to the volcano&#x27;s eastern side, so only the western flanks can be used by the public. The western side can be reached from the Oregon Route 22 highway.

Jefferson Park, on the northern slope of the mountain, can be reached on foot by taking the Whitewater Trail and following the Pacific Crest Trail for . Located within the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, it represents a popular tourist destination for its views, lakes, and meadows, with activities including backpacking, climbing, and hiking during the summer, as well as nature photography. The area contains 26 campsites, which enforce a maximum group size of 12 people, and do not allow campfires. As a result of increased traffic to the area between 2012 and 2014, the Willamette National Forest administration enforced a campsite reservation system as of 2016, but stopped the practice in 2017 due to its failure to reduce human impact within the region.

The Jefferson Lake Trail runs for round trip, with an elevation gain of . Parts of the Trail were destroyed by a fire in the wilderness area in 2003, but the surviving remnants of the trail reopened after maintenance work was completed. At Marion Lake, there are several trails, including a long route and a hike to Marion Mountain that lasts round-trip. These and other trails through the region offer views of the devastation of fires in the wilderness area in 2003 and 2006. The Whitewater Trail runs north through the wilderness area for before reaching a junction, with the right path moving to the Pacific Crest Trail. In the Maxwell trail area, hikes of all difficulty levels can be found, including the challenging Maxwell Butte Trail 3391, the round trip at Santiam Lake Trail 3491, and the slightly less demanding Duffy Lake Trail 3427. At the Pamelia Lake trail area, there are streams, lakes, and springs, as well as bathrooms, parking areas, and picnic tables. The Pamelia Limited Entry Area only allows 20 groups per day and limits their size to mitigate human impacts on the wilderness. Trails at Pamelia Lake include the Hunts Creek Trail 3440 and a segment of the Pacific Crest Trail, in addition to the Pamelia Lake Trail 3439, which rises before meeting the Hunts Creek Trail. The area is popular for backpacking, mountaineering, horseback riding, and day hiking. Other popular trails include the Firecamp Lakes Trail and Canyon Creek Meadows trails. In addition to the trails, some of the most popular areas around Mount Jefferson Wilderness include Eight Lakes Basin, Pamelia Lake, Jack Lake, Duffy Lake, Russell Lake, Santiam Lake and Wasco Lake.

Mount Jefferson can be climbed, but the route is challenging, especially the pinnacle of the summit. Nearly annually, at least one climber attempting Jefferson perishes. Because of the hazards and difficulty of climbing Mount Jefferson, the U.S. National Geodetic Survey recommends that only experienced climbers try to climb it.

<text>Mycobacterium is a genus of over 190 species in the phylum Actinomycetota, assigned its own family, Mycobacteriaceae. This genus includes pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals, including tuberculosis (&quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;) and leprosy (&quot;M. leprae&quot;) in humans. The Greek prefix &quot;myco-&quot; means &#x27;fungus&#x27;, alluding to this genus&#x27; mold-like colony surfaces. Since this genus has cell walls with a waxy lipid-rich outer layer containing high concentrations of mycolic acid, acid-fast staining is used to emphasize their resistance to acids, compared to other cell types.

Mycobacterial species are generally aerobic, non-motile, and capable of growing with minimal nutrition. The genus is divided based on each species&#x27; pigment production and growth rate. While most &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species are non-pathogenic, the genus&#x27; characteristic complex cell wall contributes to evasion from host defenses.

==Microbiology==

=== Morphology ===
Mycobacteria are aerobic with 0.2-0.6 μm wide and 1.0-10 μm long rod shapes. They are generally non-motile, except for the species &quot;Mycobacterium marinum&quot;, which has been shown to be motile within macrophages. Mycobacteria possess capsules and most do not form endospores. &quot;M. marinum&quot; and perhaps &quot;M. bovis&quot; have been shown to sporulate; however, this has been contested by further research. The distinguishing characteristic of all &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species is a thick, hydrophobic, and mycolic acid-rich cell wall made of peptidoglycan and arabinogalactan, with these unique components offering targets for new tuberculosis drugs.

=== Physiology ===
Many &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species readily grow with minimal nutrients, using ammonia and/or amino acids as nitrogen sources and glycerol as a carbon source in the presence of mineral salts. Temperatures for optimal growth vary between species and media conditions, ranging from 25 to 45 °C.

Most &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species, including most clinically relevant species, can be cultured in blood agar. However, some species grow very slowly due to extremely long reproductive cycles, such as &quot;M. leprae&quot; requiring 12 days per division cycle compared to 20 minutes for some &quot;E. coli&quot; strains.

=== Ecology ===
Whereas &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; and &quot;M. leprae&quot; are pathogenic, most mycobacteria do not cause disease unless they enter skin lesions of those with pulmonary and/or immune dysfunction, despite being widespread across aquatic and terrestrial environments. Through biofilm formation, cell wall resistance to chlorine, and association with amoebas, mycobacteria can survive a variety of environmental stressors. The agar media used for most water testing does not support the growth of mycobacteria, allowing it to go undetected in municipal and hospital systems.

=== Genomics ===
Hundreds of &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; genomes have been completely sequenced.

The genome sizes of mycobacteria range from relatively small ones (e.g. in &quot;M. leprae&quot;) to quite large ones, such as that as &quot;M. vulneris,&quot; encoding 6,653 proteins, larger than the ~6000 proteins of eukaryotic yeast.
== Pathogenicity ==

=== &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; complex ===
&quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; can remain latent in human hosts for decades after an initial infection, allowing it to continue infecting others. It has been estimated that a third of the world population has latent tuberculosis (TB). &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; has many virulence factors, which can be divided across lipid and fatty acid metabolism, cell envelope proteins, macrophage inhibitors, kinase proteins, proteases, metal-transporter proteins, and gene expression regulators. Several lineages such as &quot;M. t.&quot; var. &quot;bovis&quot; (bovine TB) were considered separate species in the &quot;M, tuberculosis&quot; complex until they were finally merged into the main species in 2018.

=== Leprosy ===
The development of Leprosy is caused by infection with either &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; or &quot;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&quot;, two closely related bacteria. Roughly 200,000 new cases of infection are reported each year, and 80% of new cases are reported in Brazil, India, and Indonesia. &quot;M. leprae&quot; infection localizes within the skin macrophages and Schwann cells found in peripheral nerve tissue.

=== Nontuberculosis &quot;Mycobacteria&quot; ===

Nontuberculosis Mycobacteria (NTM), which exclude &quot;M. tuberculosis, M. leprae,&quot; and &quot;M. lepromatosis,&quot; can infect mammalian hosts. These bacteria are referred to as &quot;atypical mycobacteria.&quot; Although person-to-person transmission is rare, transmission of &quot;M. abscessus&quot; has been observed between patients with cystic fibrosis. The four primary diseases observed in humans are chronic pulmonary disease, disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients, skin and soft tissue infections, and superficial lymphadenitis. 80-90% of recorded NTM infections manifest as pulmonary diseases.

&quot;M. abscessus&quot; is the most virulent rapidly-growing mycobacterium (RGM), as well as the leading cause of RGM based pulmonary infections. Although it has been traditionally viewed as an opportunistic pathogen like other NTMs, analysis of various virulence factors (VFs) have shifted this view to that of a true pathogen. This is due to the presence of known mycobacterial VFs and other non-mycobacterial VFs found in other prokaryotic pathogens.

=== Virulence factors ===
Mycobacteria have cell walls with peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan, and mycolic acid; a waxy outer mycomembrane of mycolic acid; and an outermost capsule of glucans and secreted proteins for virulence. It constantly remodels these layers to survive in stressful environments and avoid host immune defenses. This cell wall structure results in colony surfaces resembling fungi, leading to the genus&#x27; use of the Greek prefix &quot;myco-&quot;. This unique structure makes penicillins ineffective, instead requiring a multi-drug antibiotic treatment of isoniazid to inhibit mycolic acid synthesis, rifampicin to interfere with transcription, ethambutol to hinder arabinogalactan synthesis, and pyrazinamide to impede Coenzyme A synthesis.
== History ==
Mycobacteria have historically been categorized through phenotypic testing, such as the Runyon classification of analyzing growth rate and production of yellow/orange carotenoid pigments. Group I contains photochromogens (pigment production induced by light), Group II comprises scotochromogens (constitutive pigment production), and the non-chromogens of Groups III and IV have a pale yellow/tan pigment, regardless of light exposure. Group IV species are &quot;rapidly-growing&quot; mycobacteria compared to the &quot;slowly-growing&quot; Group III species because samples grow into visible colonies in less than seven days.

Because the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) currently recognizes 195 &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species, classification and identification systems now rely on DNA sequencing and computational phylogenetics. The major disease-causing groups are the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; complex (tuberculosis), &quot;M. avium&quot; complex (mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection), &quot;M. leprae&quot; and &quot;M. lepromatosis&quot; (leprosy), and &quot;M. abscessus&quot; (chronic lung infection).

Microbiologist Enrico Tortoli has constructed a phylogenetic tree of the genus&#x27; key species based on the earlier genetic sequencing of Rogall, et al. (1990), alongside new phylogentic trees based on Tortoli&#x27;s 2017 sequencing of 148 &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species:

===Proposed division of the genus===
Gupta &quot;et al.&quot; have proposed dividing &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; into five genera, based on an analysis of 150 species in this genus. Due to controversy over complicating clinical diagnoses and treatment, all of the renamed species have retained their original identity in the &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; genus as a valid taxonomic synonym:
* Mycobacterium based on the Slowly-Growing Tuberculosis-Simiae clade
* &quot;Mycobacteroides&quot; based on the Rapidly-Growing Abscessus-Chelonae clade
* &quot;Mycolicibacillus&quot; based on the Slowly-Growing Triviale clade
* &quot;Mycolicibacter&quot; based on the Slowly-Growing Terrae clade
* &quot;Mycolicibacterium&quot; based on the Rapidly-Growing Fortuitum-Vaccae clade

==Diagnosis==
The two most common methods for visualizing these acid-fast bacilli as bright red against a blue background are the Ziehl-Neelsen stain and modified Kinyoun stain. Fite&#x27;s stain is used to color &quot;M. leprae&quot; cells as pink against a blue background. Rapid Modified Auramine O Fluorescent staining has specific binding to slowly-growing mycobacteria for yellow staining against a dark background. Newer methods include Gomori-Methenamine Silver staining and Perioidic Acid Schiff staining to color &quot;Mycobacterium avium complex&quot; (MAC) cells black and pink, respectively.

While some mycobacteria can take up to eight weeks to grow visible colonies from a cultured sample, most clinically relevant species will grow within the first four weeks, allowing physicians to consider alternative causes if negative readings continue past the first month. Growth media include Löwenstein–Jensen medium and mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT).
== Mycobacteriophages ==
Mycobacteria can be infected by mycobacteriophages, a class of viruses with high specificity for their targets. By hijacking the cellular machinery of mycobacteria to produce additional phages, such viruses can be used in phage therapy for eukaryotic hosts, as they would die alongside the mycobacteria. Since only some mycobacteriophages are capable of penetrating the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; membrane, the viral DNA may be delivered through artificial liposomes because bacteria uptake, transcribe, and translate foreign DNA into proteins.

== Mycosides ==
Mycosides are glycolipids isolated from &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species with Mycoside A found in photochromogenic strains, Mycoside B in bovine strains, and Mycoside C in avian strains. Different forms of Mycoside C have varying success as a receptor to inactivate mycobacteriophages. Replacement of the gene encoding mycocerosic acid synthase in &quot;M. bovis&quot; prevents formation of mycosides.

<text>The Supreme Court of India (ISO: &quot;&quot;) is the supreme judicial authority and the highest court of the Republic of India. It is the final court of appeal for all civil and criminal cases in India. It also has the power of judicial review. The Supreme Court, which consists of the Chief Justice of India and a maximum of fellow 33 judges, has extensive powers in the form of original, appellate and advisory jurisdictions.

As the apex constitutional court, it takes up appeals primarily against verdicts of the High Courts of various states and tribunals. As an advisory court, it hears matters which are referred by the president of India. Under judicial review, the court invalidates both normal laws as well as constitutional amendments as per the Basic structure doctrine that it developed in the 1960s and 1970s.

It is required to safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens and settles legal disputes among the central government and various state governments. Its decisions are binding on other Indian courts as well as the union and state governments. As per the of the Constitution, the court has the inherent jurisdiction to pass any order deemed necessary in the interest of &quot;complete justice&quot; which becomes binding on the president to enforce. The Supreme Court replaced the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the highest court of appeal since 28 January 1950, two days after India was declared a republic.

With expansive authority to initiate actions and wield appellate jurisdiction over all courts and the ability to invalidate amendments to the constitution, the Supreme Court of India is widely acknowledged as one of the most powerful supreme courts in the world.

== History ==
In 1861, the &quot;Indian High Courts Act 1861&quot; was enacted to create high courts for various provinces and abolish Supreme Courts at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay and also the s&quot;adar adalats&quot; in presidency towns in their respective regions. These new high courts had the distinction of being the highest courts for all cases till the creation of the Federal Court of India under the &quot;Government of India Act 1935&quot;. The Federal Court had the jurisdiction to solve disputes between provinces and federal states and hear appeals against judgement of the high courts. The first CJI of India was H. J. Kania.

The Supreme Court of India came into existence on 28 January 1950. It replaced both the Federal Court of India and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which were then at the apex of the Indian court system. The first proceedings and inauguration, however, took place on 28 January 1950 at 9:45 am, when the judges took their seats; which is thus regarded as the official date of establishment.

The Supreme Court initially had its seat at the Chamber of Princes in the parliament building where the previous Federal Court of India sat from 1937 to 1950. The first Chief Justice of India was H. J. Kania. In 1958, the Supreme Court moved to its present premises. Originally, the Constitution of India envisaged a supreme court with a chief justice and seven judges; leaving it to Parliament to increase this number. In its formative years, the Supreme Court met from 10 to 12 in the morning and then from 2 to 4 in the afternoon for 28 days per month.

== Jurisdiction and Powers of the Supreme Court ==
The Supreme Court of India was constituted as per Chapter IV of Part V of the Constitution of India. The fourth Chapter of the Indian Constitution is &quot; The Union Judiciary&quot;. Under this Chapter, the Supreme Court of India is vested with all Jurisdiction.

== Members of Collegium ==
Presently, the Members of Collegium are:
*Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna
*Justice Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai
*Justice Surya Kant
*Justice Hrishikesh Roy
*Justice Abhay S. Oka

== Court building architecture ==
The building is shaped to symbolize scales of justice with its centre-beam being the Central Wing of the building, consisting of the chief justice&#x27;s court, the largest of the courtrooms, with two court halls on either side. The Right Wing of the structure has the Bar, consisting of rooms, the offices of the Attorney General of India and other law officers and the library of the court. The Left Wing has the offices of the court. In all, there are 15 courtrooms in the various wings of the building.
 These two wings act as the two limbs of the balance and end with two semi-circular hooks that represent the pans of the balance, and the centres of the two semi-circular pans connect to a centrally placed statue of ‘Mother and Child’ in the garden.

The foundation stone of the Supreme Court&#x27;s building was laid on 29 October 1954 by Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India. The main block of the building has been built on a triangular plot of 17 acres and has been designed in an Indo-British style by the chief architect Ganesh Bhikaji Deolalikar, the first Indian to head the Central Public Works Department. The design of scales of justice was to conform to this triangular site and according to Rajendra Prasad was the conception of justice for Indians. It has a high dome and a spacious colonnaded verandah. The court moved into the building in 1958. In 1979, two new wingsthe East Wing and the West Wingwere added to the complex. 1994 saw the last extension.

=== Mother and Child Sculpture ===
On 20 February 1978, a black bronze sculpture of height was installed in the lawn of the Supreme Court. The sculpture was made by the renowned artist Chintamoni Kar. The statue, as per its sculptor Kar, reproduces ‘‘Mother India sheltering young Republic represented by the symbol of a child upholding the law of the country shown in the form of an open book, with the symbol of the balance representing law and justice’’. The official account states that it represents a ‘‘dispensation of equal justice to all’’. The black bronze sculpture has been placed at the center of the park on the lawn of the Court just behind the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, which is in front of the staircase of the Supreme Court building in the front lawn. The statue, when it was being put in the Court premises, led to protests by advocates of the Court in 1978 and a demand was made for its removal. A memorandum was submitted to the then law minister Shanti Bhushan, which stated that ‘‘the statue is supposedly a symbol and inspiration for the highest institution of justice, the Supreme Court….The child is nondescript, but the mother’s resemblance to Mrs. Indira Gandhi is discernible even to the ordinary eye not trained for appreciating the nuances of sculpture’’. As the statue was put up in the year 1978, the post-emergency period of India, they contended that it is symbolic of perversity and is based on the theme of the mother-and-son cult built up during the Emergency (India) period. Different interpretations of the statue came from advocates, one said, ‘it’s like Indira mothering the judges and telling them you practice justice like I tell you to’, while the other said, ‘symbolizing justice is terribly conservative as justice is constantly changing’. Later on, though the advocates submitted an apology memorandum after they got to know that the maquette was made in the year 1969.

=== Seal ===

The design of the Court&#x27;s seal is reproduced from the wheel that appears on the Sarnath Lion capital of Ashoka with 24 spokes. The inscription in Sanskrit, &quot;यतो धर्मस्ततो जयः&quot; (IAST: ,) means &quot;whence justice (dharma), thence victory&quot;. It is also referred as the wheel of righteousness, encompassing truth, goodness and equity.

=== Flag ===
On 1 September 2024, the Supreme Court unveiled a flag for the Court&#x27;s use, combining elements of the seal and the Court&#x27;s architecture. The flag is a deep blue colour and depicts the Ashoka Chakra set above the rotunda of the Court. The flag also features the Constitution of India. The flag was inaugurated by President of India Droupadi Murmu on September 1, 2024, commemorating the 75th anniversary of supreme court.

=== Nyay Ki Devi ===
Nyay Ki Devi (Devanagari: न्याय की देवी) is a new symbolic statue of justice installed in the library of the judges in the Supreme Court. It is simply called &quot;Nyay Devi&quot;. It was installed on 16 October 2024.

The colour of the statue &quot;Nyay Ki Devi&quot; is white. The &quot;goddess of justice&quot; is shown in the Indian attire. She is in a &quot;sari&quot; having a crown on her head as well as a &quot;Bindi&quot; on her forehead and jewelleries on her ears and neck. In the right hand of the statue, there is scales which symbolises the equality in society during the process of justice. Similarly in the left hand, there is a book which symbolises the constitution of India. The book symbolises that the process of justice would be according to the constitution of India.

== Constitution of the Court ==

=== Registry ===
The registry of the Supreme Court is headed by the secretary-general, who is currently assisted by 10 registrars, several additional and deputy registrars, etc. Article 146 of the Constitution deals with the appointments of officers and servants of the Supreme Court registry.

=== Supreme Court advocates ===

Supreme Court Rules, 2013 entitle only those advocates who are registered with the Supreme Court, called advocates-on-record to appear, act and plead for a party in the court. Those advocates who are designated as &#x27;senior advocates&#x27; by the Supreme Court or any of the high courts can appear for clients along with an advocate-on-record. Any other advocate can appear for a party along with or under instructions from an advocate-on-record.

== Composition ==

=== Size of the court ===

Initially, the Constitution of India provided for a Supreme Court with a chief justice and 7 judges. In the early years, a full bench of the Supreme Court sat together to hear the cases presented before them. As the work of the Court increased and cases began to accumulate, Parliament increased the number of judges (including the chief justice) from the original 8 in 1950 to 11 in 1956, 14 in 1960, 18 in 1978, 26 in 1986, 31 in 2009, to 34 in 2019. As the number of the judges has increased, they sit in smaller benches of two or three (referred to as a division bench)—coming together in larger benches of five or more (referred to as a constitution bench) when required to settle fundamental questions of law. A bench may refer a case before it to a larger bench, should the need arise.

The largest-ever bench at the Supreme Court of India has been constituted in 1973 in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala. A bench of 13 judges was set up to decide whether Parliament had the unfettered right to amend the Constitution, which eventually gave rise to the Basic Structure doctrine.

=== Eligibility of a judge of the Supreme Court ===
A citizen of India not exceeding 65 years age per of the Constitution who has been:

* a judge of one high court or more (continuously), for at least five years,
* an advocate there, for at least ten years,
* a distinguished jurist, in the opinion of the president, power conferred by clause 2 of article 124 of the Constitution of India

is eligible to be recommended for appointment, a judge of the Supreme Court.

=== Court demographics ===
In practice, judges of the Supreme Court have been selected so far, mostly from amongst judges of the high courts. Barely nine justices—S. M. Sikri, S. Chandra Roy, Kuldip Singh, Santosh Hegde, R. F. Nariman, U. U. Lalit, L. Nageswara Rao, Indu Malhotra and P. S. Narasimha and K.V. Viswanathan—have been appointed to the Supreme Court directly from the bar (i.e., who were practising advocates).

The Supreme Court saw its first woman judge when Justice M. Fathima Beevi was sworn into office in 1989.

In 1968, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah became the first Muslim chief justice of India. In 2007, Justice K. G. Balakrishnan became the first judge as well as the chief justice of India from the &quot;dalit&quot; community. In 2010, Justice S. H. Kapadia coming from a Parsi minority community became the chief justice of India. In 2017, Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar became the first Sikh chief justice of India. Justice Indu Malhotra is the first and only woman judge to be selected directly from the bar.

== Judicial independence ==
The Constitution seeks to ensure the independence of Supreme Court judges in various ways. Per of directive principles of state policy, the state shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive. Independence of the judiciary, the supremacy of the constitution and rule of law are the features of the basic structure of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court and high courts are empowered to frame &quot;suo moto&quot; cases without receiving formal petitions/complaints on any suspected injustice, including actions/acts indulging in contempt of court and contempt of the Constitution by the executive, legislators, citizens, etc. It is acknowledged as one of the most autonomous judiciaries in the entirety of Southeast Asia.

The main purpose of the Supreme Court is to decide constitutional issues. It is the duty of the judiciary to frame &quot;suo moto&quot; cases or to probe cases/petitions at the earliest against the executive or legislature when laws are implemented which violate the basic foundation and structure of the Constitution as stated in Article 38 (1) of the Directive Principles. It ensures that-&quot;the state/judiciary shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing a social order in which social, economic and political justice is animated/informed in all institutions of life.&quot;

B. R. Ambedkar clarified as given below in the Constituent Assembly debates on highlighting its inevitable implementation.

=== Appointments and the collegium ===

As per the constitution, as held by the court in the Three Judges Cases – (1982, 1993, 1998), a judge is appointed to the Supreme Court by the president on the recommendation of the &quot;collegium&quot;  — a closed group of the Chief Justice of India, the four most senior judges of the court and the senior-most judge hailing from the high court of a prospective appointee. This has resulted in a Memorandum of Procedure being followed, for the appointments.

Judges used to be appointed by the president on the advice of the union cabinet. After 1993 (the Second Judges&#x27; Case), no minister, or even the executive collectively, can suggest any names to the president, who ultimately decides on appointing them from a list of names recommended only by the &quot;collegium&quot; of the judiciary. Simultaneously, as held in that judgment, the executive was given the power to reject a recommended name.

The collegium system has come under a fair amount of criticism. In 2015, Parliament passed a law to replace the collegium with a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). This was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, in the Fourth Judges&#x27; Case, as the new system would undermine the independence of the judiciary. Putting the old system of the collegium back, the court invited suggestions, even from the general public, on how to improve the collegium system, broadly along the lines ofsetting up an eligibility criteria for appointments, a permanent secretariat to help the collegium sift through material on potential candidates, infusing more transparency into the selection process, grievance redressal and any other suggestion not in these four categories, like transfer of judges. This resulted in the court asking the government and the collegium to finalize the memorandum of procedure incorporating the above.

In 2009, a challenge arose in the Supreme Court regarding the recommendation for the appointment of a high court judge made by the collegium of that specific court. The court asserted that the eligibility to become a judge was a factual matter, open to questioning by any individual. On the contrary, the determination of who should become a judge was deemed a matter of opinion and was beyond questioning. The court emphasized that, as long as a thorough consultation occurred within the collegium to form this opinion, the content or material considered in shaping the opinion was not subject to scrutiny in a court of law.

=== Tenure ===
Judges of the Supreme Court in India currently conclude their service upon reaching the age of 65. Nevertheless, there have been proposals put forth by Supreme Court judges advocating for the implementation of a predetermined tenure for judges, including the Chief Justice of India.

=== Salary ===
Article 125 of the Indian constitution leaves it to the Indian parliament to determine the salary, other allowances, leave of absence, pension, etc. of the Supreme Court judges. However, the parliament cannot alter any of these privileges rights to the judge&#x27;s disadvantage after his/her appointment. A judge of the Supreme Court draws a salary of per month—equivalent to the most-senior civil servant of the Indian government, Cabinet Secretary of India—while the chief justice earns per month.

=== Oath or affirmation ===
Per Article 124 and third Schedule of the constitution, the chief justice (or a judge) of the Supreme Court of India is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the president an oath or affirmation that they
=== Removal ===
 of the Constitution, the president of India can remove a judge on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity when parliament approves with a majority of the total membership of each house in favour of impeachment and not less than two thirds of the members of each house present. For initiating impeachment proceedings against a judge, at least 50 members of Rajya Sabha or 100 members of Lok Sabha shall issue the notice per &quot;Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968&quot;. Then a judicial committee would be formed to frame charges against the judge, to conduct the fair trial and to submit its report to parliament. When the judicial committee report finds the judge guilty of misbehaviour or incapacity, further removal proceedings would be taken up by Parliament if the judge is not resigning himself.

The judge upon proven guilty is also liable for punishment per applicable laws or for contempt of the constitution by breaching the oath under disrespecting constitution

=== Post-retirement ===
A person who has retired as a judge of the Supreme Court is debarred from practicing in any court of law or before any other authority in India. However, Supreme Court and high court judges are appointed to various posts in tribunals and commissions, after their retirement. Lawyer Ashish Goel in a recent article criticized this stating that post-retirement benefits for judges hampers judicial independence. Former law minister and senior advocate of the Supreme Court Arun Jaitley also criticized the appointment of judges in government posts after their retirement. Jaitley famously said:&quot;There are two kinds of judges – those who know the law and those who know the Law Minister. We are the only country in the world where judges appoint judges. Even though there is a retirement age, judges are not willing to retire. Pre-retirement judgements are influenced by post-retirement jobs.&quot;

=== Review petition ===
Article 137 of the Indian Constitution grants the Supreme Court the authority to reevaluate its own decisions. According to this article, the Supreme Court can review any judgment or order it has previously pronounced. This power is subject to any laws created by Parliament or rules established under Article 145. The Supreme Court holds the ability to invalidate parliamentary and governmental decisions if they violate fundamental features. Additionally, it can overturn the impeachment process of the President and Judges, as decided by Parliament, based on constitutional validity or fundamental features.

Under Order XL of the Supreme Court Rules, that have been framed under its powers under Article 145 of the constitution, the Supreme Court may review its judgment or order but no application for review is to be entertained in a civil proceeding except on the grounds mentioned in Order XLVII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

=== Powers to punish for contempt ===
Under Articles 129 and 142 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has been vested with power to punish anyone for contempt of any court in India including itself. The Supreme Court performed an unprecedented action when it directed a sitting Minister of State in Maharashtra government, Swaroop Singh Naik, to be jailed for 1-month on a charge of contempt of court on 12 May 2006.

== Rules ==
Article 145 of the Indian Constitution grants the Supreme Court the authority to create its own rules, subject to presidential approval, to govern the practice and procedures of the court. These rules have been revised and published three times, first in 1950, then in 1966, and most recently in 2013.

== Roster system ==
From 5 February 2018 onwards, the Supreme Court adopted a fresh roster system for assigning cases to judges. According to this new arrangement, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) is designated to preside over all special leave petitions (SLPs) and cases concerning public interest, social justice, elections, arbitration, criminal matters, and more. Other members of the collegium or senior judges are tasked with hearing cases related to labour disputes, taxation, compensation, consumer protection, maritime law, mortgage, personal law, family law, land acquisition, service, company matters, and other relevant areas.

== Reporting and citation ==
Supreme Court Reports is the official journal of reportable Supreme Court decisions. It is published under the authority of the Supreme Court of India by the Controller of Publications, Government of India, Delhi. In addition, there are many other reputed private journals that report Supreme Court decisions. Some of these other important journals are: SCR (The Supreme Court Reports), SCC (Supreme Court Cases), AIR (All India Reporter), SCALE, etc.

== Facilities in the campus ==
Legal-aid, court-fee vendors, first-aid post, dental clinic, physiotherapy unit and pathology lab; rail-reservation counter, canteen, post office and a branch and 3 ATMs of UCO Bank, Supreme Court Museum can be availed by litigants and visitors.

== Landmark judgments ==
=== Land reform ===
After some of the courts overturned state laws for redistributing land from &quot;zamindar&quot; (landlord) estates on the ground that the laws violated the zamindars&#x27; fundamental rights, Parliament passed the 1st amendment to the constitution in 1951, followed by the 4th amendment in 1955, to uphold its authority to redistribute land. The Supreme Court countered these amendments in 1967 when it ruled in &quot;Golaknath v. State of Punjab&quot; that Parliament did not have the power to abrogate fundamental rights, including the provisions on private property. The 25th amendment to the constitution in 1971 curtailed the right of a citizen to property as a fundamental right and gave authority to the government to infringe private property, which led to a furor amongst the &quot;zamindars&quot;.

=== During the Emergency (1975–1977) ===
The independence of the judiciary was severely curtailed during the Indian Emergency (1975–1977) of Indira Gandhi. The constitutional rights of imprisoned persons were restricted under preventive detention laws passed by Parliament. In the case of Shiva Kant Shukla (&quot;Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v. Shiv Kant Shukla&quot;), popularly known as the &quot;Habeas Corpus case&quot;, a bench of five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the state&#x27;s right to unrestricted powers of detention during the emergency. Justices A.N. Ray, P. N. Bhagwati, Y. V. Chandrachud, and M.H. Beg, stated in the majority decision:
:(under the declaration of emergency) no person has any locus to move any writ petition under Art. 226 before a High Court for habeas corpus or any other writ or order or direction to challenge the legality of an order of detention.
The only dissenting opinion was from Justice H. R. Khanna, who stated:
:detention without trial is an anathema to all those who love personal liberty... A dissent is an appeal to the brooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of a future day, when a later decision may possibly correct the error into which the dissenting judge believes the court to have been betrayed.

It is believed that before delivering his dissenting opinion, Justice Khanna had mentioned to his sister: &quot;I have prepared my judgment, which is going to cost me the chief justiceship of India.&quot; In January 1977, Justice Khanna was superseded despite being the most senior judge at the time and thereby the government broke the convention of appointing only the seniormost judge to the position of chief justice of India. Justice Khanna remains a legendary figure among the legal fraternity in India for this decision.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of this opinion: &quot;The submission of an independent judiciary to absolutist government is virtually the last step in the destruction of a democratic society; and the Indian supreme court&#x27;s decision appears close to utter surrender.&quot;

During the emergency period, the government also passed the 39th amendment, which sought to limit judicial review for the election of the prime minister; only a body constituted by parliament could review this election. Subsequently, Parliament, with most opposition members in jail during the emergency, passed the 42nd Amendment which prevented any court from reviewing any amendment to the constitution with the exception of procedural issues concerning ratification. A few years after the emergency, however, the Supreme Court rejected the absoluteness of the 42nd amendment and reaffirmed its power of judicial review in &quot;Minerva Mills v. Union of India&quot; (1980).

=== Post-1980: an assertive court ===
After Indira Gandhi lost elections in 1977, the new government of Morarji Desai, and especially law minister Shanti Bhushan (who had earlier argued for the detenues in the &quot;Habeas Corpus case&quot;), introduced a number of amendments making it more difficult to declare and sustain an emergency, and reinstated much of the power to the Supreme Court. It is said that the basic structure doctrine, created in &quot;Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala&quot;, was strengthened in &quot;Indira Gandhi&#x27;s&quot; case and set in stone in &quot;Minerva Mills v. Union of India&quot;.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s creative and expansive interpretations of Article 21 (Life and Personal Liberty), primarily after the Emergency period, have given rise to a new jurisprudence of public interest litigation that has vigorously promoted many important economic and social rights (constitutionally protected but not enforceable) including, but not restricted to, the rights to free education, livelihood, a clean environment, food and many others. Civil and political rights (traditionally protected in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Indian constitution) have also been expanded and more fiercely protected. These new interpretations have opened the avenue for litigation on a number of important issues.

=== Since 2000 ===
Among the important pronouncements of the Supreme Court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (Judgment of 11 January 2007). A unanimous bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the &quot;basic structure&quot; doctrine. It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the court regards as forming part of the &quot;basic structure&quot; of the constitution can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences. The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of Parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights. The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golaknath case regarding non-amendability of the constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights, contrary to the judgment in the &quot;Kesavananda Bharati&quot; case.

Another important decision was of the five-judge bench in &quot;Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India&quot;; where the constitutional validity of Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 was upheld, subject to the &quot;creamy layer&quot; criteria. Importantly, the court refused to follow the &#x27;strict scrutiny&#x27; standards of review followed by the United States Supreme Court. At the same time, the court has applied the strict scrutiny standards in Anuj Garg v. Hotel Association of India (2007) (Beyond Reasonableness – A Rigorous Standard of Review for Article 15 Infringement)a

==== 2G spectrum case ====
The Supreme Court declared allotment of spectrum as &quot;unconstitutional and arbitrary&quot; and quashed all the 122 licenses issued in 2008 during tenure of A. Raja (then minister for communications &amp; IT), the main official accused in the 2G case.

==== Right to Information ====
In the year 2010, the Supreme Court filed an appeal before itself challenging the judgement of the Delhi high court holding that the office of the chief justice of India came under the ambit of the RTI Act and was liable to reveal information under it. On 13 November 2019, the chief justice of India&#x27;s office was brought under RTI Act by a majority judgement.

==== Black money ====
The government refused to disclose details of about 18 Indians holding accounts in LGT Bank, Liechtenstein, evoking a sharp response from a bench comprising justices B Sudershan Reddy and S S Nijjar. The court ordered the Special investigation team (SIT) to probe the matter. Lack of enthusiasm made the court create a special investigative team (SIT).

==== Minority reservations ====
The Supreme Court upheld the Andhra Pradesh High Court judgement quashing 4.5% sub-quota for minorities under OBC reservation quota of 27%.

==== Online/postal ballot for Indian citizen living abroad (NRIs) ====
Three judge bench presided by the then chief justice of India Altamas Kabir issued notice to the Union government and the Election Commission of India (EC) on the PIL filed by a group of NRIs for online/postal ballot for the Indian citizens living abroad.

==== &quot;T. S. R. Subramanian vs. Union of India&quot; ====
While hearing &quot;T.S.R. Subramanian vs Union of India&quot;, a division bench of the Supreme Court ruled that
* Officers of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), officers other All India Services, and other civil servants were not required to follow oral instructions, as they &#x27;undermine credibility&#x27;.
* A Civil Services Board (CSB), headed by the Cabinet secretary at national level, and chief secretary at state level, be set up to recommend transfer/postings of the officers of the All India Services (IAS, IFoS and IPS).
* Transfers of Group &#x27;B&#x27; officers were to be done by the Heads of Departments (HoDs).
* There was to be no interference of Ministers in state, other than the Chief Minister, in transfers/postings of civil servants.
These rulings were received mostly positively, and were termed as &#x27;major reform(s)&#x27;.

==== Recognition of transgender as &#x27;third gender&#x27; in law ====
In April 2014, Justice K. S. Radhakrishnan declared transgender to be the &#x27;third gender&#x27; in Indian law, in the case, &quot;National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India&quot;. The ruling said:

Seldom, our society realises or cares to realise the trauma, agony and pain which the members of Transgender community undergo, nor appreciates the innate feelings of the members of the Transgender community, especially of those whose mind and body disown their biological sex. Our society often ridicules and abuses the Transgender community and in public places like railway stations, bus stands, schools, workplaces, malls, theatres [and] hospitals; they are sidelined and treated as untouchables, forgetting the fact that the moral failure lies in the society&#x27;s unwillingness to contain or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we have to change.

Justice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education. He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, &quot;These TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings, and therefore, they have every right to enjoy their human rights,&quot; concluding by declaring that:

(1) Hijras, eunuchs, apart from binary gender, were to be treated as &quot;third gender&quot; for the purpose of safeguarding their rights under Part III of the Indian Constitution and the laws made by Parliament and the State Legislatures.

(2) Transgender persons&#x27; right to decide their self-identified gender was to be upheld and that the Union and State Governments were to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.

==== Relief to over 35,000 public servants ====
In the case of B. Prabhakara Rao vs. State of A.P., a significant issue emerged involving an abrupt reduction in the retirement age from 58 to 55 years for more than 35,000 public servants of the State Government, public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, educational institutions, and Tirupathi-Tirumalai Devasthanams (TTD). Initially, they faced defeat in the initial legal proceedings in the Supreme Court. Recognizing the error, a new legislation was enacted to restore the original retirement age of 58 years. However, it included a provision stating that those whose reduction in retirement age had been previously upheld would not benefit from the new law.

Challenging this legislation, Subodh Markandeya argued that the remedy was simply to strike down the word &quot;not.&quot; This argument found favour with the Supreme Court, bringing relief to more than 35,000 public servants as the court ruled in their favour.

==== Right to privacy (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) &amp; Anr. vs. Union of India &amp; Ors) ====

The Court upheld that the right to privacy is protected as a fundamental right under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. This judgment clarified that the Right to Privacy could be infringed upon only when there was a compelling state interest for doing so. This position was the same as with the other fundamental rights. It explicitly overruled three previous judgements of the Supreme Court.

==== Decriminalisation of homosexuality ====

On 6 September 2018, a five-member constitutional bench decriminalised homosexuality by partially striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in the case Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India. The bench led by Dipak Misra unanimously declared that criminalisation of private consensual sex between adult persons of the same sex under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was clearly unconstitutional. The court, however, held that the section would apply to bestiality, sex with minors and non consensual sexual acts.

==== Ayodhya dispute ====
A political, historical, and socio-religious debate, the Ayodhya dispute has been going on since 1961 when the first case was filed in court. The Supreme Court, after a marathon 40 day hearing which concluded on 16 October, reserved the decision and revealed it on 9 November 2019 stating that the disputed land will be given to Hindus and also ruled that the Muslim community will be given an alternative piece of 5 acre land for the construction of a mosque. This was one of the biggest decisions before the retirement of then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi on 17 November 2019.

==== Electoral bond verdict ====

The Court struck down a scheme that allowed individuals and companies to anonymously donate to political parties, stating it was a violation of a voter&#x27;s right to information about political funding. They also pointed out that it &quot;would lead to &quot;quid pro quo&quot; arrangements&quot; between corporations and politicians. SBI and the Election Commission were obligated to publish all donor data available, including the names and the amount of donors they had collected.

== Critical assessment ==

=== Corruption ===
The year 2008 saw the Supreme Court embroiled in several controversies, from serious allegations of corruption at the highest level of the judiciary, expensive private holidays at the tax payers expense, refusal to divulge details of judges&#x27; assets to the public, secrecy in the appointments of judges&#x27;, to refusal to make information public under the Right to Information Act. The chief justice K. G. Balakrishnan invited a lot of criticism for his comments on his post not being that of a public servant, but that of a constitutional authority. He later went back on this stand. The judiciary has come in for serious criticisms from former presidents Pratibha Patil and A. P. J. Abdul Kalam for failure in handling its duties. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh, has stated that corruption is one of the major challenges facing the judiciary, and suggested that there is an urgent need to eradicate this menace.

The Cabinet Secretary of India introduced the judges Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2008 in parliament for setting up of a panel called the National Judicial Council, headed by the Chief Justice of India, that will probe into allegations of corruption and misconduct by High Court and Supreme Court judges.

=== Pending cases ===

According to Supreme Court newsletter, there are 58,519 cases pending in the Supreme Court, out of which 37,385 are pending for more than a year, at the end of 2011. Excluding connected cases, there are still 33,892 pending cases. Per the latest pendency data made available by the Supreme Court, the total number of pending cases in the Supreme Court as on 1 November 2017 is 55,259 which includes 32,160 admission matters (miscellaneous) and 23,099 regular hearing matters. In May 2014, former Chief Justice of India, Justice R.M. Lodha, proposed to make Indian judiciary work throughout the year (instead of the present system of having long vacations, specially in the higher courts) in order to reduce pendency of cases in Indian courts; however, per this proposal there is not going to be any increase in the number of working days or working hours of any of the judges and it only meant that different judges would be going on vacation during different periods of the year per their choice; but, the Bar Council of India rejected this proposal mainly because it would have inconvenienced the advocates who would have to work throughout the year. More over, various time frames specified in &#x27;code of civil procedure&#x27; are also diluted by Supreme Court judgements to give the courts right to endlessly adjourn the cases. The International Bar Association cited that access to speedy justice faces a serious crisis.

=== Rule of law ===
The Supreme Court has not taken up the trial of many pending cases, since April 2014 (more than 6 years), challenging the validity of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, which was enacted by the Parliament without following the stipulated procedure in the Constitution, and is claimed detrimental to the basic foundation of the constitution on which the basic structure of the constitution is resting. The basic foundation of the constitution is the dignity and the freedom of its citizens, which is of supreme importance and cannot be destroyed or infringed by any legislation of the parliament. Whereas the fair trial to examine the validity of the ninety-ninth constitutional amendment, dated 31 December 2014, to form National Judicial Appointments Commission for the purpose of appointing the judges of the Supreme Court and high courts, was conducted on utmost priority and the Supreme Court delivered its judgement on 16 October 2015 (within a year), quashing the constitutional amendment as unconstitutional and ultra vires, stating that the said amendment interferes with the independence of the judiciary. Disposal of the various petitions filed against the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 is also equally important as it has alienated the basic rights of a vast section of Indian citizens and also against the federal character of the constitution, which is part of the basic structure of the constitution. The Supreme Court is also wasting its valuable time by not taking up the case in toto but conducting a piecemeal trial by delivering its judgement to dispose of petitions related to the apportionment of assets between the newly formed states Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The Supreme Court is also conducting a piecemeal trial of the petitions filed by the states regarding water sharing of rivers and bifurcation of the common high court without considering the earlier pending petitions challenging the validity of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 which is the basic cause of all these disputes. Under checks and balances as provided in the Constitution, it is the duty of the judiciary/Supreme Court to establish the rule of law at the earliest by rectifying any misuse of the Constitution by Parliament and the executive without colluding with them and to remove perceptions of people that rule of law is sidelined and a section of its citizens are subjected to discrimination.

=== Four judges vs chief justice ===
On 12 January 2018, four senior judges of the Supreme Court; Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph addressed a press conference criticizing Chief Justice Dipak Misra&#x27;s style of administration and the manner in which he allocated cases among judges of the Supreme Court. However, people close to Misra denied the allegations that the allocation of cases was unfair. On 20 April 2018, seven opposition parties submitted a petition seeking the impeachment of Dipak Misra to Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, with signatures from seventy-one parliamentarians. On 23 April 2018, the petition was rejected by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, primarily on the basis that the complaints were about administration and not misbehaviour, and that thus impeachment would seriously interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of the judiciary.

=== Holidays and working hours ===
The Supreme Court works from 10:30am to 4pm, but is closed during winter and summer for two weeks each. Some critics feel that this delays pending cases. However, in an interview in June 2018 with NDTV, Justice Chelameswar revealed that most Supreme Court judges including him work around 14 hours per day, and continue to work for an average of 7 hours per day even during vacations. He further compared the court to the Supreme Court of the United States, which delivers judgement on around 120 cases in a year, while each judge in the Supreme Court of India delivers judgements on 1,0001,500 cases.

=== Appointment ===

It has been noted that consensus within the Collegium is at times achieved through trade-offs, resulting in unreliable appointments with consequences for litigants. There has also been a rise in sycophancy and &quot;lobbying&quot; within the system. Justice Chelameswar provided evidence from existing records to support this claim. In one case, &quot;a judge was blocked from elevation to the Madras High Court in 2009, in what &#x27;appeared to have been a joint venture in the subversion of the law governing the collegium system by both the executive and the judiciary.&#x27;&quot;

=== Controversies ===
On 18 April 2019 an unnamed woman employee of the Supreme Court filed an affidavit stating that Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had sexually harassed her on 10–11 October 2018 by pressing his body against hers against her will. An in-house committee of the Court quickly cleared Gogoi of the sexual harassment charges, although the report of the committee was not provided to the complainant. However, there were widespread protests against the manner in which the woman&#x27;s complaint was dealt with by Supreme Court. A petition was filed before the National Human Rights Commission to obtain the report of the in-house committee. National Law University Delhi topper Surbhi Karwa skipped her convocation to avoid receiving her degree from Ranjan Gogoi in protest. The in house committee which cleared Gogoi of sexual harassment was chaired by Justice S A Bobde, who himself succeeded Gogoi as chief justice. The woman complainant stated that she was terrified by the systematic victimisation of her family members who were all dismissed from service following her protest against Gogoi&#x27;s sexual advances.

<text>The cone penetration or cone penetrometer test (CPT) is a method used to determine the geotechnical engineering properties of soils and delineating soil stratigraphy. It was initially developed in the 1950s at the Dutch Laboratory for Soil Mechanics in Delft to investigate soft soils. Based on this history it has also been called the &quot;Dutch cone test&quot;. Today, the CPT is one of the most used and accepted soil methods for soil investigation worldwide.

The test method consists of pushing an instrumented cone, with the tip facing down, into the ground at a controlled rate (controlled between 1.5 -2.5 cm/s accepted). The resolution of the CPT in delineating stratigraphic layers is related to the size of the cone tip, with typical cone tips having a cross-sectional area of either 10 or 15 cm2, corresponding to diameters of 3.6 and 4.4 cm. A very early ultra-miniature 1 cm2 subtraction penetrometer was developed and used on a US mobile ballistic missile launch system (MGM-134 Midgetman) soil/structure design program in 1984 at the Earth Technology Corporation of Long Beach, California.

== History and development ==

The early applications of CPT mainly determined the logistics of soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical measurements of the total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the &quot;tip friction&quot;) and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed-in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20 cm but as small as 1 cm.
Manufacturers of cone penetrometer probes and data acquisition systems include Hogentogler, which has been acquired by the Vertek Division of Applied Research Associates, GeoPoint Systems BV and Pagani Geotechnical Equipment.

== Additional in situ testing parameters ==
In addition to the mechanical and electronic cones, a variety of other CPT-deployed tools have been developed over the years to provide additional subsurface information. One common tool advanced during CPT testing is a geophone set to gather seismic shear wave and compression wave velocities. This data helps determine the shear modulus and Poisson&#x27;s ratio at intervals through the soil column for soil liquefaction analysis and low-strain soil strength analysis. Engineers use the shear wave velocity and shear modulus to determine the soil&#x27;s behavior under low-strain and vibratory loads. Additional tools such as laser-induced fluorescence, X-ray fluorescence, soil conductivity/resistivity, pH, temperature and membrane interface probe and cameras for capturing video imagery are also increasingly advanced in conjunction with the CPT probe.

An additional CPT deployed tool used in Britain, Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and France is a piezocone combined with a tri-axial magnetometer. This is used to attempt to ensure that tests, boreholes, and piles, do not encounter unexploded ordnance (UXO) or duds. The magnetometer in the cone detects ferrous materials of 50 kg or larger within a radius of up to about 2 m distance from the probe depending on the material, orientation and soil conditions.

== Standards and use ==
CPT for geotechnical applications was standardized in 1986 by ASTM Standard D 3441 (ASTM, 2004). ISSMGE provides international standards on CPT and CPTU. Later ASTM Standards have addressed the use of CPT for various environmental site characterization and groundwater monitoring activities. For geotechnical soil investigations, CPT is more popular compared to SPT as a method of geotechnical soil investigation. Its increased accuracy, speed of deployment, more continuous soil profile and reduced cost over other soil testing methods. The ability to advance additional in situ testing tools using the CPT direct push drilling rig, including the seismic tools described above, are accelerating this process.

<doc id="395872" wikidata="Q10566404" url="?curid=395872" title="Right of abode in Hong Kong">
<text>Right of abode in Hong Kong entitles a person to live and work in the territory without any restrictions or conditions of stay. Someone who has that right is a Hong Kong permanent resident. Foreign nationals may acquire the right of abode after meeting a seven-year residency requirement and are given most rights usually associated with citizenship, including the right to vote in regional elections. However, they are not entitled to hold territorial passports or stand for office in some Legislative Council constituencies, unless they also naturalise as Chinese citizens.

As a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong does not have its own nationality law and natural-born residents are generally Chinese citizens. Prior to 1997, the territory was a colony of the United Kingdom and right of abode was tied to British nationality law. Although Hong Kong, mainland China, and Macau constitute a single country, local residents with Chinese citizenship do not have automatic residence rights in either of the other two jurisdictions, which both control immigration separately. Similarly, mainland Chinese and Macanese residents do not automatically have residence or employment rights in Hong Kong.

== History ==
=== Colonial era policy ===
Hong Kong was a British colony from 1842 until its transfer to China in 1997. Accordingly, regulations on local residence rights were closely tied to British nationality law during colonial rule. All British subjects previously had unrestricted access to live and work in any British territory. Parliament gradually restricted this from 1962 to 1971, when subjects originating from outside of the British Islands first had immigration controls imposed on them when entering the United Kingdom. Hong Kong followed suit and imposed greater restrictions on subjects from outside the territory. British subjects born in the colony were given belonger status, to indicate their possession of right of abode in Hong Kong. Nationality law reform in 1981 reclassified the vast majority of Hong Kong belongers as British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs).

The border between Hong Kong and mainland China was not regulated for over 100 years after establishment of the colony. Border controls did not exist until 1950, after communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. Although the border was guarded, the Hong Kong government was relatively lax in deporting illegal immigrants due to a shortage of unskilled labour within the territory, allowing large numbers of them to register as residents. Still, colonial authorities held almost unlimited discretionary deportation powers over Chinese migrants until 1971, when those resident in the territory for more than seven years were given the &quot;right to land&quot;. This exempted them from immigration control, though they could still be deported for serious crimes. Immigration became more restricted in 1974 at the start of the Touch Base Policy. Under this system, illegal immigrants captured by law enforcement were immediately deported but those who had managed to reach urban areas of Hong Kong and found housing accommodation were given legal status. This policy ended in 1980, after which all free migration was stopped.

Chinese migrants moving to Hong Kong forfeited their &quot;hukou&quot; in mainland China and became ineligible for Chinese passports. These individuals were treated as if they were stateless. The colonial government issued Documents of Identity as travel documents to those who could not obtain passports. After seven years of residence, they were issued Certificates of Identity (CIs).

=== Transitionary arrangements ===
The British and Chinese governments entered negotiations over the future of Hong Kong in the early 1980s and agreed on the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984. The basic principles for the right of abode are set as part of this treaty and further defined in the Hong Kong Basic Law, which encompass the right to land with the added entitlement that a bearer cannot be deported. Belonger status was renamed &quot;permanent resident status&quot; in 1987, when landed Chinese residents were given the right of abode along with Hong Kong BDTCs. All BDTCs who did not have a connection with a remaining British Dependent Territory other than Hong Kong lost BDTC status on 1 July 1997. Former ethnic Chinese BDTCs became Chinese nationals and could only retain British nationality if they had registered as British Nationals (Overseas) prior to the transfer of sovereignty. Individuals who were not ethnically Chinese, had not registered as BN(O)s, and would have been stateless at that date automatically became British Overseas citizens. Holders of CIs were able to replace them with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports after the handover.

== Acquisition and loss ==
How an individual could acquire (or lose) his or her right of abode in Hong Kong depends on his or her nationality.

=== Acquisition ===
Acquisition by birth operates on a modified &quot;jus soli&quot; basis; Chinese nationals born in Hong Kong are automatically permanent residents, while foreign nationals must have at least one parent who possesses right of abode. Children born outside of Hong Kong acquire right of abode if they are also Chinese nationals at birth. Chinese nationality is usually conferred by descent to children born abroad, unless the parents have obtained permanent residency in another country or foreign citizenship. However, while Chinese nationals born in mainland China to Hong Kong permanent resident parents do have right of abode, they must first be approved for One-way Permits by mainland authorities before claiming permanent residency. Residents of Macau also do not have automatic right of entry into Hong Kong.

Non-residents seeking to apply to become permanent residents must have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of at least seven years. &quot;Ordinarily resident&quot; in this context excludes certain classes of people, including central government officials, foreign domestic helpers, and incarcerated individuals. Chinese nationals may qualify using any seven-year residence period, while foreigners are only eligible on the basis of the seven years immediately preceding their applications. Individuals from mainland China seeking to settle in Hong Kong are additionally subject to emigration control by the central government.

=== Loss ===
Permanent residents who are not Chinese nationals will automatically lose their right of abode if they have been absent from Hong Kong for more than 36 months after they ceased to have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong. These individuals are then given the right to land, which also allows them unrestricted access to live and work in the territory. Foreign permanent residents can naturalise as Chinese nationals and become exempt from automatic loss, but are required to renounce their previous nationality on successful application. Children with foreign nationality who were born in Hong Kong and have permanent residency by descent also automatically lose right of abode at age 21 and are given the right to land. They may subsequently reapply for right of abode on the basis of a seven-year residence period. Chinese nationals with right of abode may only be deprived of the status if they lose their Chinese nationality.

Prior to 1997, acquisition of the right of abode was dependent on British nationality. Individuals born overseas to Hong Kong-connected BDTCs also became BDTCs and Hong Kong permanent residents by descent. After the transfer of sovereignty, if these individuals did not also acquire Chinese nationality or return to Hong Kong within three years, they would be nonpermanent residents with the right to land.

Individuals who lost permanent resident status before 1997 can immediately resume the right of abode under limited circumstances. Those who returned to settle in Hong Kong within 18 months after the transfer of sovereignty were automatically regranted the status, while former residents who return after that period can only immediately regain the right of abode if they have not been absent from the territory for any period longer than three years.

== Rights and restrictions ==
Permanent residents have the unrestricted right to live and work in Hong Kong and cannot be deported from the territory, regardless of their nationality. They are required to register for Hong Kong permanent identity cards (as opposed to standard identity cards which are issued to any person admitted to the territory for more than 180 days), eligible for welfare benefits, and able to vote in regional elections. Chinese nationals with territorial right of abode are eligible to hold Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports, which are different from those issued to mainland residents. Those who additionally do not possess right of abode in foreign countries may stand for office in geographical constituencies of the Legislative Council and can serve as principal officials of the government. A limited number of residents with foreign nationality or right of abode in other countries may be elected to functional constituency seats in the legislature.

According to Article 99 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, public servants serving in all government departments of the HKSAR must be permanent residents of the HKSAR except where otherwise provided for in Article 101, however, there is no stipulated requirement about the nationality or passport of a civil servant.

Hong Kong permanent residents do not have automatic residence or employment rights in mainland China. The central government issues Home Return Permits to residents who are Chinese citizens for travel purposes and Residence Permits if they intend to reside or work in the mainland for longer than six months. Hong Kong permanent residents are also subject to immigration controls in Macau, and must obtain residence permits if living there for more than one year.

== Legal challenges to eligibility requirements ==
The eligibility criteria for right of abode has been a contentious issue and repeatedly challenged in court since the transfer of sovereignty. Because constitutional issues require central government review, litigation on right of abode issues has highlighted conflicting differences between the legal systems of the territory and mainland and xenophobic sentiment among local residents.

=== Children born in mainland China ===
In 1999, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) issued two judgements that granted right of abode in Hong Kong to children born in mainland China with at least one parent who had the right of abode, including those whose parents had become a permanent resident after the time of birth. The regional government expected that 1.67 million new immigrants from the mainland would seek to acquire the right of abode on these terms over the next decade, and projected that Hong Kong would not be able to absorb such a sudden population increase. Although the CFA is the highest territorial court, the Court clarified that its authority to interpret the Basic Law derives from the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC). The government subsequently asked the Standing Committee to provide a new interpretation of Basic Law Article 24, which defines right of abode eligibility, and Article 22, which stipulates that people from other parts of China are required to seek central government approval before entering Hong Kong. The NPCSC duly issued an interpretation that reinforced requirements for mainland exit procedures and restricted eligibility for right of abode to the criteria as it was before the CFA rulings. The CFA confirmed its effect in local law in &quot;Lau Kong Yung v Director of Immigration&quot;.

While the interpretation resolved the immediate immigration crisis, the constitutionality and legality of bypassing the Court of Final Appeal was widely debated. Many legislators, especially the pro-democracy camp, and the Hong Kong Bar Association believed that amending the Basic Law would have been the appropriate course of remedy. They argued that arbitrary NPCSC interpretations without formal requests for them from the CFA would weaken the principle of &quot;one country, two systems&quot;, damage the rule of law, and erode the authority of the CFA as the territory&#x27;s final appellate court. Although constitutional judicial review is routine in common law systems, Beijing viewed the process as a limit to its authority as the sovereign power and preferred more flexible interpretation of the law. Additionally, the regional government believed that revising the Basic Law would delay resolving the issue for too long since amendments require review by the entire National People&#x27;s Congress, which only meets once each spring.

=== Children of mainland visitors ===
The Court of Final Appeal issued a further ruling in 2001 that all Chinese nationals born in Hong Kong would have right of abode in the region, even if neither parent was a permanent resident. This change directly led to a growing trend of birth tourism; increasing numbers of expectant mothers from the mainland entered Hong Kong to give birth with the express purpose of exploiting the healthcare system and giving their children permanent residency in the territory. Overcrowding in hospital maternity wards became a major factor in contributing to growing consternation among residents and the emergence of a hostile environment against mainland tourists.

=== Foreign domestic helpers ===
Foreign domestic helpers (FDHs), live-in female household workers mostly from the Philippines or Indonesia, constitute the largest non-Chinese minority group in Hong Kong. They are not considered ordinarily resident in the territory and cannot claim permanent residency. Racial tension between these workers and local residents, pervasive perceptions of FDHs as being lower class, and a general public unwillingness to integrate them led some FDHs to more actively protest their disadvantaged legal status. However, in 2013, the Court of Final Appeal upheld existing government exclusion of FDHs from right of abode eligibility in &quot;Vallejos v Commissioner of Registration&quot;. A majority of Hongkongers did not support the extension of residency rights to this minority group, fearing an increase in government spending to accommodate them. The current regulatory environment for FDHs, including the lack of access to right of abode, continues to be criticised for making this class of minorities particularly vulnerable to domestic exploitation and abuse.

<text>Bancroft Hall, at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, is said to be the largest contiguous set of academic dormitories in the U.S. Bancroft Hall, named after former U.S. Secretary of the Navy, and historian/author George Bancroft, is home for the entire brigade of 4,000 midshipmen, and contains some 1,700 rooms, of corridors, and of floor space. All the basic facilities that midshipmen need for daily living are found in the hall. It is referred to as &quot;Mother B&quot; or &quot;The Hall&quot; by Midshipmen.

==History==
Bancroft Hall was designed in the Beaux-Arts style with its mansard roof and dormer windows by architect Ernest Flagg and its central rotunda and first two wings were built in 1901–06. Over the intervening years it has been expanded to encompass eight wings of five stories (&quot;decks&quot;) each numbered 0–4. The original two wings (1906) are now the 3rd and 4th wings; the next pair, added in 1917, are now the 1st and 2nd wings; a pair added in 1939 became the 5th and 6th wings; and a final pair were added in the 1961 as the 7th and 8th wings. The 3rd wing was built over the remains of the old Fort Severn.

In addition to the midshipmen rooms, Bancroft Hall houses offices for the Commandant of Midshipmen, six battalion officers, six battalion chaplains, thirty company officers and their senior enlisted leaders, a barbershop, bank, travel office, a small restaurant known as &quot;Steerage,&quot; textbook store, general store (&quot;The Midshipmen Store&quot;), laundromat, uniform store, cobbler shop, the USNA Band, the USNA branch of the United States Postal Service, a gymnasium, spaces for extracurricular activities, and full medical &amp; dental clinics as well as small optometry and orthopedics clinics. The Hall has its own ZIP code (21412).

A nine-year renovation project completed in 2003 by The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company and RTKL Associates Inc. of Baltimore, Maryland included of wiring to equip the building with a modern data communication network.

The building also contains King Hall (named after Fleet Admiral Ernest King, (1878–1956), Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet in the Second World War) where all midshipmen are fed simultaneously three times daily, and Memorial Hall (see below). Memorial Hall and the Rotunda of Bancroft Hall are open to the general public, but access to the rest of the building is normally limited to assigned Naval personnel or accompanied authorized visitors.

There are rooms in Bancroft dedicated to each Academy graduate Medal of Honor recipient in the United States Navy or Marine Corps.

==The Rotunda and Memorial Hall==
Central to Bancroft Hall is the Rotunda, with wings on either side. Over the Rotunda is a large mural of the , during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in World War II.

Memorial Hall is up the large staircase from the Rotunda. This hall contains the honor roll of over 2,660 Naval Academy alumni who have died in military operations; their names are listed by class year on the walls and includes non-graduates and midshipmen. In the front of the hall, opposite the entrance, is a panel containing the full names and class years of the 963 alumni who are listed as killed in action. This panel is organized by war and alphabetically by last name. Throughout the rest of the hall there are memorials and plaques to specific alumni or small groups of alumni. (Details about the lives of the men and women honored in Memorial Hall are catalogued at the Virtual Memorial Hall project.)

There are 489 panes of glass in the skylight.

Below Memorial Hall is Smoke Hall.

===Memorial Hall Dedication===
The Dedication in Memorial Hall was written by William Nathaniel Thomas, Chaplain USNA (1892–1971) who was the seventh US Navy Chief of Chaplains (1945–1949). Memorial Hall within Bancroft Hall honors those United States Naval Academy alumni lost in combat or military operations in service to their country. In 1952 after soliciting suggestions for the dedication, Royal S. Pease, Professor, Department of English, USNA, wrote Chaplain Thomas &quot;...There was a very widespread search for this and scores of suggestions were made. None seemed at all satisfactory until yours was presented. It was at once seized upon as being the right sort of thing: in the right spirit and in the right phrase. Widespread criticism was invited... but they found none to improve upon yours. It is now in Memorial Hall, below the &#x27;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship&#x27; flag.&quot;

In the aftermath of the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident, the Navy balked at listing Lieutenant Commander Philip Armstrong Jr. and Lieutenant Stephen Toth, two &quot;Liberty&quot; crew members, on the memorial wall. It took Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer&#x27;s personal intervention to reverse their decision; Moorer angrily commented on the Academy&#x27;s attempt to omit the names: &quot;I intervened and was able to reverse the apparent idea that dying in a cowardly, one-sided attack by a supposed ally is somehow not the same as being killed by an avowed enemy.&quot;

==Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Trophy==
The Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Trophy is awarded to each season&#x27;s winner of the triangular college football series among the United States Naval Academy (Navy Midshipmen), the United States Military Academy (Army Black Knights), and the United States Air Force Academy (Air Force Falcons). When Navy has possession of the trophy, it is displayed in a glass case in the Rotunda.

<doc id="395877" wikidata="Q61233" url="?curid=395877" title="Histamine">
<text>Histamine is an organic nitrogenous compound involved in local immune responses communication, as well as regulating physiological functions in the gut and acting as a neurotransmitter for the brain, spinal cord, and uterus. Discovered in 1910, histamine has been considered a local hormone (autocoid) because it&#x27;s produced without involvement of the classic endocrine glands; however, in recent years, histamine has been recognized as a central neurotransmitter. Histamine is involved in the inflammatory response and has a central role as a mediator of itching. As part of an immune response to foreign pathogens, histamine is produced by basophils and by mast cells found in nearby connective tissues. Histamine increases the permeability of the capillaries to white blood cells and some proteins, to allow them to engage pathogens in the infected tissues. It consists of an imidazole ring attached to an ethylamine chain; under physiological conditions, the amino group of the side-chain is protonated.

== Properties ==
Histamine base, obtained as a mineral oil mull, melts at 83–84 °C. Hydrochloride and phosphorus salts form white hygroscopic crystals and are easily dissolved in water or ethanol, but not in ether. In aqueous solution, the imidazole ring of histamine exists in two tautomeric forms, identified by which of the two nitrogen atoms is protonated. The nitrogen farther away from the side chain is the &#x27;tele&#x27; nitrogen and is denoted by a lowercase tau sign and the nitrogen closer to the side chain is the &#x27;pros&#x27; nitrogen and is denoted by the pi sign. The tele tautomer, &quot;Nτ-H&quot;-histamine, is preferred in solution as compared to the pros tautomer, &quot;Nπ-H&quot;-histamine.

Histamine has two basic centres, namely the aliphatic amino group and whichever nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring does not already have a proton. Under physiological conditions, the aliphatic amino group (having a p&quot;K&quot;a around 9.4) will be protonated, whereas the second nitrogen of the imidazole ring (p&quot;K&quot;a ≈ 5.8) will not be protonated.
Thus, histamine is normally protonated to a singly charged cation. Since human blood is slightly basic (with a normal pH range of 7.35 to 7.45) therefore the predominant form of histamine present in human blood is monoprotic at the aliphatic nitrogen. Histamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter.

== Synthesis and metabolism ==
Histamine is derived from the decarboxylation of the amino acid histidine, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme -histidine decarboxylase. It is a hydrophilic vasoactive amine.

Once formed, histamine is either stored or rapidly inactivated by its primary degradative enzymes, histamine-&quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase or diamine oxidase. In the central nervous system, histamine released into the synapses is primarily broken down by histamine-&quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase, while in other tissues both enzymes may play a role. Several other enzymes, including MAO-B and ALDH2, further process the immediate metabolites of histamine for excretion or recycling.

Bacteria also are capable of producing histamine using histidine decarboxylase enzymes unrelated to those found in animals. A non-infectious form of foodborne disease, scombroid poisoning, is due to histamine production by bacteria in spoiled food, particularly fish. Fermented foods and beverages naturally contain small quantities of histamine due to a similar conversion performed by fermenting bacteria or yeasts. Sake contains histamine in the 20–40 mg/L range; wines contain it in the 2–10 mg/L range.

== Storage and release ==

Most histamine in the body is generated in granules in mast cells and in white blood cells (leukocytes) called basophils. Mast cells are especially numerous at sites of potential injury – the nose, mouth, and feet, internal body surfaces, and blood vessels. Non-mast cell histamine is found in several tissues, including the hypothalamus region of the brain, where it functions as a neurotransmitter. Another important site of histamine storage and release is the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell of the stomach.

The most important pathophysiologic mechanism of mast cell and basophil histamine release is immunologic. These cells, if sensitized by IgE antibodies attached to their membranes, degranulate when exposed to the appropriate antigen. Certain amines and alkaloids, including such drugs as morphine, and curare alkaloids, can displace histamine in granules and cause its release. Antibiotics like polymyxin are also found to stimulate histamine release.

Histamine release occurs when allergens bind to mast-cell-bound IgE antibodies. Reduction of IgE overproduction may lower the likelihood of allergens finding sufficient free IgE to trigger a mast-cell-release of histamine.

== Degradation ==
Histamine is released by mast cells as an immune response and is later degraded primarily by two enzymes: diamine oxidase (DAO), coded by AOC1 genes, and histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT), coded by the HNMT gene. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at these genes are associated with a wide variety of disorders, from ulcerative colitis to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Histamine degradation is crucial to the prevention of allergic reactions to otherwise harmless substances.

DAO is typically expressed in epithelial cells at the tip of the villus of the small intestine mucosa. Reduced DAO activity is associated with gastrointestinal disorders and widespread food intolerances. This is due to an increase in histamine absorption through enterocytes, which increases histamine concentration in the bloodstream. One study found that migraine patients with gluten sensitivity were positively correlated with having lower DAO serum levels. Low DAO activity can have more severe consequences as mutations in the ABP1 alleles of the AOC1 gene have been associated with ulcerative colitis. Heterozygous or homozygous recessive genotypes at the rs2052129, rs2268999, rs10156191 and rs1049742 alleles increased the risk for reduced DAO activity. People with genotypes for reduced DAO activity can avoid foods high in histamine, such as alcohol, fermented foods, and aged foods, to attenuate any allergic reactions. Additionally, they should be aware whether any probiotics they are taking contain any histamine-producing strains and consult with their doctor to receive proper support .

HNMT is expressed in the central nervous system, where deficiencies have been shown to lead to aggressive behavior and abnormal sleep-wake cycles in mice. Since brain histamine as a neurotransmitter regulates a number of neurophysiological functions, emphasis has been placed on the development of drugs to target histamine regulation. Yoshikawa et al. explores how the C314T, A939G, G179A, and T632C polymorphisms all impact HNMT enzymatic activity and the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. These mutations can have either a positive or negative impact. Some patients with ADHD have been shown to exhibit exacerbated symptoms in response to food additives and preservatives, due in part to histamine release. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, children with ADHD who responded with aggravated symptoms after consuming a challenge beverage were more likely to have HNMT polymorphisms at T939C and Thr105Ile. Histamine&#x27;s role in neuroinflammation and cognition has made it a target of study for many neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). De novo deletions in the HNMT gene have also been associated with ASD.

Mast cells serve an important immunological role by defending the body from antigens and maintaining homeostasis in the gut microbiome. They act as an alarm to trigger inflammatory responses by the immune system. Their presence in the digestive system enables them to serve as an early barrier to pathogens entering the body. People who suffer from widespread sensitivities and allergic reactions may have mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), in which excessive amounts of histamine are released from mast cells, and cannot be properly degraded. The abnormal release of histamine can be caused by either dysfunctional internal signals from defective mast cells or by the development of clonal mast cell populations through mutations occurring in the tyrosine kinase Kit. In such cases, the body may not be able to produce sufficient degradative enzymes to properly eliminate the excess histamine. Since MCAS is symptomatically characterized as such a broad disorder, it is difficult to diagnose and can be mislabeled as a variety of diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia.

Histamine is often explored as a potential cause for diseases related to hyper-responsiveness of the immune system. In patients with asthma, abnormal histamine receptor activation in the lungs is associated with bronchospasm, airway obstruction, and production of excess mucus. Mutations in histamine degradation are more common in patients with a combination of asthma and allergen hypersensitivity than in those with just asthma. The HNMT-464 TT and HNMT-1639 TT polymorphisms are significantly more common among children with allergic asthma, the latter of which is overrepresented in African-American children.

== Mechanism of action ==
In humans, histamine exerts its effects primarily by binding to G protein-coupled histamine receptors, designated H1 through H4. , histamine is believed to activate ligand-gated chloride channels in the brain and intestinal epithelium.

== Roles in the body ==
Although histamine is small compared to other biological molecules (containing only 17 atoms), it plays an important role in the body. It is known to be involved in 23 different physiological functions. Histamine is known to be involved in many physiological functions because of its chemical properties that allow it to be versatile in binding. It is Coulombic (able to carry a charge), conformational, and flexible. This allows it to interact and bind more easily.

=== Vasodilation and fall in blood pressure ===
It has been known for more than one hundred years that an intravenous injection of histamine causes a fall in the blood pressure. The underlying mechanism concerns both vascular hyperpermeability and vasodilation. Histamine binding to endothelial cells causes them to contract, thus increasing vascular leak. It also stimulates synthesis and release of various vascular smooth muscle cell relaxants, such as nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors and other compounds, resulting in blood vessel dilation. These two mechanisms play a key role in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis.

=== Effects on nasal mucous membrane ===
Increased vascular permeability causes fluid to escape from capillaries into the tissues, which leads to the classic symptoms of an allergic reaction: a runny nose and watery eyes. Allergens can bind to IgE-loaded mast cells in the nasal cavity&#x27;s mucous membranes. This can lead to three clinical responses:

# sneezing due to histamine-associated sensory neural stimulation
# hyper-secretion from glandular tissue
# nasal congestion due to vascular engorgement associated with vasodilation and increased capillary permeability

=== Sleep-wake regulation ===

Histamine is a neurotransmitter that is released from histaminergic neurons which project out of the mammalian hypothalamus. The cell bodies of these neurons are located in a portion of the posterior hypothalamus known as the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). The histamine neurons in this region comprise the brain&#x27;s histamine system, which projects widely throughout the brain and includes axonal projections to the cortex, medial forebrain bundle, other hypothalamic nuclei, medial septum, the nucleus of the diagonal band, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, striatum, substantia nigra, hippocampus, thalamus and elsewhere. The histamine neurons in the TMN are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle and promote arousal when activated. The neural firing rate of histamine neurons in the TMN is strongly positively correlated with an individual&#x27;s state of arousal. These neurons fire rapidly during periods of wakefulness, fire more slowly during periods of relaxation/tiredness, and stop firing altogether during REM and NREM (non-REM) sleep.

First-generation H1 antihistamines (i.e., antagonists of histamine receptor H1) are capable of crossing the blood–brain barrier and produce drowsiness by antagonizing histamine H1 receptors in the tuberomammillary nucleus. The newer class of second-generation H1 antihistamines do not readily permeate the blood–brain barrier and thus are less likely to cause sedation, although individual reactions, concomitant medications and dosage may increase the likelihood of a sedating effect. In contrast, histamine H3 receptor antagonists increase wakefulness. Similar to the sedative effect of first-generation H1 antihistamines, an inability to maintain vigilance can occur from the inhibition of histamine biosynthesis or the loss (i.e., degeneration or destruction) of histamine-releasing neurons in the TMN.

=== Gastric acid release ===
Enterochromaffin-like cells in the stomach release histamine, stimulating parietal cells via H2 receptors. This triggers carbon dioxide and water uptake from the blood, converted to carbonic acid by carbonic anhydrase. The acid dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions within the parietal cell. Bicarbonate returns to the bloodstream, while hydrogen is pumped into the stomach lumen. Histamine release ceases as stomach pH decreases. Antagonist molecules, such as ranitidine or famotidine, block the H2 receptor and prevent histamine from binding, causing decreased hydrogen ion secretion.

=== Protective effects ===
While histamine has stimulatory effects upon neurons, it also has suppressive ones that protect against the susceptibility to convulsion, drug sensitization, denervation supersensitivity, ischemic lesions and stress. It has also been suggested that histamine controls the mechanisms by which memories and learning are forgotten.

=== Erection and sexual function ===

Loss of libido and erectile dysfunction can occur during treatment with histamine H2 receptor antagonists such as cimetidine, ranitidine, and risperidone. The injection of histamine into the corpus cavernosum in males with psychogenic impotence produces full or partial erections in 74% of them. It has been suggested that H2 antagonists may cause sexual dysfunction by reducing the functional binding of testosterone to its androgen receptors.

=== Schizophrenia ===
Metabolites of histamine are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with schizophrenia, while the efficiency of H1 receptor binding sites is decreased. Many atypical antipsychotic medications have the effect of increasing histamine production, because histamine levels seem to be imbalanced in people with that disorder.

=== Multiple sclerosis ===
Histamine therapy for treatment of multiple sclerosis is currently being studied. The different H receptors have been known to have different effects on the treatment of this disease. The H1 and H4 receptors, in one study, have been shown to be counterproductive in the treatment of MS. The H1 and H4 receptors are thought to increase permeability in the blood-brain barrier, thus increasing infiltration of unwanted cells in the central nervous system. This can cause inflammation, and MS symptom worsening. The H2 and H3 receptors are thought to be helpful when treating MS patients. Histamine has been shown to help with T-cell differentiation. This is important because in MS, the body&#x27;s immune system attacks its own myelin sheaths on nerve cells (which causes loss of signaling function and eventual nerve degeneration). By helping T cells to differentiate, the T cells will be less likely to attack the body&#x27;s own cells, and instead, attack invaders.

== Disorders ==
As an integral part of the immune system, histamine may be involved in immune system disorders and allergies. &quot;Mastocytosis&quot; is a rare disease in which there is a proliferation of mast cells that produce excess histamine.

Histamine intolerance is a presumed set of adverse reactions (such as flush, itching, rhinitis, etc.) to ingested histamine in food. The mainstream theory accepts that there may exist adverse reactions to ingested histamine, but does not recognize histamine intolerance as a separate condition that can be diagnosed.

The role of histamine in health and disease is an area of ongoing research. For example, histamine is researched in its potential link with migraine episodes, when there is a noted elevation in the plasma concentrations of both histamine and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). These two substances are potent vasodilators, and have been demonstrated to mutually stimulate each other&#x27;s release within the trigeminovascular system, a mechanism that could potentially instigate the onset of migraines. In patients with a deficiency in histamine degradation due to variants in the AOC1 gene that encodes diamine oxidase enzyme, a diet high in histamine has been observed to trigger migraines, that suggests a potential functional relationship between exogenous histamine and CGRP, which could be instrumental in understanding the genesis of diet-induced migraines, so that the role of histamine, particularly in relation to CGRP, is a promising area of research for elucidating the mechanisms underlying migraine development and aggravation, especially relevant in the context of dietary triggers and genetic predispositions related to histamine metabolism.

== Measurement ==
Histamine, a biogenic amine, involves many physiological functions, including the immune response, gastric acid secretion, and neuromodulation. However, its rapid metabolism makes it challenging to measure histamine levels directly in plasma. 

As a solution for the rapid metabolism of histamine, the measurement of histamine and its metabolites, particularly the 1,4-methyl-imidazolacetic acid, in a 24-hour urine sample, provides an efficient alternative to histamine measurement because the values of these metabolites remain elevated for a much longer period than the histamine itself.

Commercial laboratories provide a 24-hour urine sample test for 1,4-methyl-imidazolacetic acid, the metabolite of histamine. This test is a valuable tool in assessing the metabolism of histamine in the body, as direct measurement of histamine in the serum has low diagnostic value due to the specificities of histamine metabolism.

The urine test involves collecting all urine produced in a 24-hour period, which is then analyzed for the presence of 1,4-methyl-imidazolacetic acid. This comprehensive approach ensures a more accurate reflection of histamine metabolism over an extended period; as such, the 1,4-methyl-imidazolacetic acid urine test offered by commercial labs is currently the most reliable method to determine the rate of histamine metabolism, which may be helpful for the health care practitioners to assess individual’s health status, such as to diagnose interstitial cystitis.

== History ==
The properties of histamine, then called β-imidazolylethylamine, were first described in 1910 by the British scientists Henry H. Dale and P.P. Laidlaw. By 1913 the name &quot;histamine&quot; was in use, using combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;amine&quot;, yielding &quot;tissue amine&quot;.

&quot;H substance&quot; or &quot;substance H&quot; are occasionally used in medical literature for histamine or a hypothetical histamine-like diffusible substance released in allergic reactions of skin and in the responses of tissue to inflammation.

<text>The Black Dahlia (1987) is a crime fiction novel by American author James Ellroy. Its subject is the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short in Los Angeles, California, which received wide attention because her corpse was horrifically mutilated and discarded in an empty residential lot. The investigation ultimately led to a broad police corruption scandal. While rooted in the facts of the Short murder and featuring many real-life people, places and events, Ellroy&#x27;s novel blends facts and fiction, most notably in providing a solution to the crime when in reality it has never been solved. James Ellroy dedicated &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, &quot;To Geneva Hilliker Ellroy 1915-1958 &quot;Mother: Twenty-nine Years Later, This Valediction in Blood&quot;.&quot; The epigraph for &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; is &quot;Now I fold you down, my drunkard, my navigator, My first lost keeper, to love and look at later. -Anne Sexton.&quot;

This book is considered the one that gained Ellroy critical attention as a serious writer of literature, expanding his renown beyond the crime novels of his early career. &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; is the first book in Ellroy&#x27;s L.A. Quartet, a cycle of novels set in 1940s and 1950s Los Angeles. He portrays the city in this period as a hotbed of political corruption and depravity. The Quartet continues with &quot;The Big Nowhere&quot;, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, and &quot;White Jazz&quot;.

==Synopsis==
In 1946, the LAPD arranges a boxing match between patrolmen Dwight &quot;Bucky&quot; Bleichert and Lee Blanchard as a publicity stunt. The fight is promoted as &quot;Fire versus Ice&quot;, reflecting their contrasting boxing styles and personalities. Bucky is cautious and reserved, racked with guilt over his betrayal of two Japanese-American friends (resulting in their wartime internment) and involvement in violently suppressing of the Zoot Suit Riots. By contrast, Lee is outgoing and jovial, already famous for catching the notorious bank robber Bobby De Witt. Lee is openly cohabiting with De Witt&#x27;s girlfriend, Kay Lake, in violation of LAPD policy.

Bucky and Lee are promoted to plainclothes jobs in the Warrants Division and are subsequently partnered together. Bucky quickly forms a close bond with Lee and Kay, seeing them as a surrogate family. Kay becomes attracted to Bucky and attempts to seduce him, revealing that her relationship with Lee is platonic, but Bucky nevertheless rebuffs her advances in order to avoid upsetting the harmonious friendship between the three of them.

In January 1947, the hideously mutilated body of Elizabeth Short is discovered. The killing, which the press dub &quot;Black Dahlia&quot;, reminds Lee of the unsolved disappearance of his younger sister Laurie, prompting him to volunteer himself and Bucky for the investigation. Another detective, the thuggish Fritz Vogel, is in cahoots with Assistant DA Ellis Loew, who hopes to use the case to launch his political career. He and Vogel repeatedly try to frame innocent men in order to close the case quickly. Bucky is initially resentful of his and Lee&#x27;s involvement in the case, but gradually becomes obsessed with Short as he learns about her chaotic and unhappy life.

One line of enquiry leads Bucky to Madeleine Sprague, a spoiled socialite who closely resembles Short and was involved in a lesbian relationship with her. In exchange for Bucky suppressing evidence about her involvement, Madeleine has sex with him, causing him to fantasize that she &quot;is&quot; Short. Bucky meets the rest of Madeleine&#x27;s family, consisting of her tyrannical father Emmett, an amoral property developer; her sickly mother Ramona; and her sister Martha, an aspiring artist. He also learns about George Tilden, an old friend of Emmett&#x27;s who was badly disfigured in a car crash and subsequently became a reclusive handyman on Emmett&#x27;s estate.

Lee becomes increasingly agitated; besides being preoccupied with the Short case, he is also worried about De Witt&#x27;s imminent release from prison. When Bucky finds a pornographic film featuring Short, Lee absconds to Tijuana, ostensibly to track down the man who made the film. Bucky follows and stumbles across the body of De Witt, apparently murdered along with Mexican drug trafficker Felix Chasco by corrupt &quot;Rurales&quot; hired by Lee. Despite De Witt&#x27;s death, Lee fails to reappear and Bucky returns to Los Angeles.

Bucky discovers that Vogel has been suppressing evidence in order to hide the fact that Short was hired as a prostitute by his son Johnny shortly before her death. Bucky forces Johnny to confess as much, leading to his being arrested for soliciting, while Vogel commits suicide. Bucky is placed on two weeks&#x27; leave and uses the time off to return to Mexico to look for Lee. There, he learns from a San Diego private investigator that Lee was murdered by a Mexican woman, probably Chasco&#x27;s lover avenging his death. With the PI&#x27;s help, Bucky finds Lee&#x27;s body buried on the beach at Ensenada. He returns to L.A. and reveals all to Kay, who in turn reveals that Lee was the real leader of the De Witt gang, and that he turned on his former accomplices in order to stop De Witt&#x27;s domestic abuse. Bucky is horrified by this revelation but forgives Lee and marries Kay. He ends his relationship with Madeleine and puts the Dahlia case behind him.

Bucky&#x27;s superiors punish him for his part in Vogel&#x27;s downfall by transferring him to the forensics unit, a career dead-end. His initially happy marriage with Kay gradually sours. Two years later, he is assigned to collect evidence surrounding the suicide of Eldridge Chambers, a former friend of Emmett. At Chambers&#x27; house, he sees a painting of a grotesque clown with a Glasgow smile, similar to Short&#x27;s facial mutilations. His interest in the Dahlia case piqued again, Bucky stakes out the Sprague mansion and discovers that Madeleine is frequently making herself up to look like Short and picking up sailors in the same bars which Short once frequented. Bucky confronts Madeleine, who explains that she&#x27;s been mimicking Short in order to lure Bucky to her, having developed a sexual fixation on him. The two renew their affair, causing Kay to leave Bucky.

During the pageant to celebrate the removal of the last four letters of the &quot;Hollywoodland&quot; sign, a nearby shack is discovered to contain a mattress covered in dried blood. Bucky conducts a forensic examination of the shack and determines that it is the place where Short was tortured and killed. He matches fingerprints at the shack to Tilden and learns that the shack is owned by Emmett.

Bucky confronts Madeleine and Emmett, who are revealed to be lovers, but they explain it is not incestuous as Madeleine is not actually Emmett&#x27;s daughter but the result of an affair between Ramona and Tilden, for which Emmett got revenge by disfiguring Tilden with a knife. Years later, Madeleine shot the porno film featuring Short in one of Emmett&#x27;s empty houses, and Tilden witnessed it and became enamoured with Short. He subsequently blackmailed Emmett and Madeleine, threatening to reveal the circumstances of his disfigurement unless Madeleine arranged for him to go on a date with Short. Moreover, Emmett reveals that Tilden, the son of an anatomist, has always been obsessed with dead bodies and habitually exhumes corpses in order to collect their organs. Aware that he can&#x27;t publicly expose Tilden and the Spragues lest he also be convicted for suppression of evidence, Bucky tracks down Tilden and kills him.

The murder is seemingly solved, but Bucky is bugged by a discrepancy in the case files and speaks to Martha Sprague, from whom he discovers that Lee had actually deduced Emmett and Madeleine&#x27;s involvement in the first few days of the investigation and used this knowledge to blackmail Emmett for $100,000. Bucky is shocked by this revelation, and in particular by the fact that Kay acted as a go-between in the deal. He confronts Kay, who is so ashamed that she leaves Los Angeles.

Bucky bumps into Chambers&#x27; widow and learns that the clown painting is of a character from the novel &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot;. Remembering that a copy of that book was found at the shack where Short was killed, he discovers that Chambers bought the painting from Ramona. Ramona confesses to Bucky that she is the real murderer, having killed Short in Tilden&#x27;s shack after gatecrashing their date; she persuaded Tilden to go along with it by offering to let him keep Short&#x27;s organs after the murder. Having modelled her torture of Short upon the novel, she subsequently sold the painting to Chambers &quot;as an act of purging.&quot;

While vacillating about whether or not to arrest Ramona, Bucky discovers that Madeleine is again dressing up as Short. Desperate to get his attention, she reveals to Bucky that she, in disguise as a Mexican woman, was the one who murdered Lee, in order to retrieve the $100,000 that he extorted from her father. Bucky arrests her and she is institutionalized; she gets revenge by revealing Bucky&#x27;s suppression of evidence, causing him to be fired from the LAPD. Bucky doesn&#x27;t disclose what he knows about Ramona, and the Dahlia case remains officially unsolved. Kay writes to Bucky telling him that she is pregnant, and the two reconcile. The novel ends with Bucky flying out to join Kay, and on the plane, he prays for Short&#x27;s spirit to watch over him in his new home – Boston, her birthplace.

==Reception==
&quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; was one of numerous neo-noir novels published in the late 1970s and 1980s. Ellroy was known as an author of crime fiction but this novel is considered to have gained him critical notice as a serious writer of literature.

Ellroy wrote three other novels in what he termed the &quot;L.A. Quartet,&quot; a cycle of novels set in 1940s and 1950s Los Angeles. He portrays the city in this period as a hotbed of political corruption and depravity. The Quartet continues with &quot;The Big Nowhere&quot;, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, and &quot;White Jazz&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
&quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; was adapted for a 2006 film of the same name by director Brian De Palma. Starring Scarlett Johansson, Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart, it was a critical and commercial failure, with the consensus being that it had been poorly made and acted. It was criticized as sometimes appearing incoherent. The latter fault may have been caused by De Palma&#x27;s drastic editing of the finished product, which initially ran for three hours and he eventually cut down to two.

==Graphic novel==
In 2013, Matz and David Fincher adapted James Ellroy&#x27;s novel into a comic called &quot;&quot;, with Miles Hyman as the illustrator. Originally published in French, it was published in English in 2016 as &quot;The Black Dahlia: A Crime Graphic Novel&quot;.

==Anachronisms==
&quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; has several references to characters having been committed to Atascadero State Hospital, but this institution did not open until 1954. The character Madeleine is committed there (ch. 3–5), but the hospital&#x27;s patient population was historically limited to men.

Madeleine tells her father she and Bucky met at an art show at Stanley Rose&#x27;s bookstore. However, that store closed permanently eight years prior in 1939.

<doc id="395883" wikidata="Q57312331" url="?curid=395883" title="Bananaman">
<text>Bananaman is a fictional character appearing in British comic books. Bananaman is a parody of traditional superheroes, being portrayed as a schoolboy who is transformed into a muscled, caped adult man when he eats a banana. The character originally appeared in &quot;Nutty&quot; as the back page strip in Issue 1, dated 16 February 1980 drawn by John Geering.

He has since appeared in &quot;The Dandy&quot; and &quot;The Beano&quot;.

==Original strip==
The original strip, by Dave Donaldson and Steve Bright, written and developed by the latter, and mostly drawn by John Geering until his death in 1999, is essentially a parody of Superman and Batman with elements of Captain Marvel and his British twin, Marvelman, and occasionally other Silver Age characters, while also combining comic slapstick with a heavy dose of eccentric British humour similar to Alan Moore&#x27;s contemporary work on Captain Britain.

After John Geering died in 1999, Barrie Appleby took over and later Tom Paterson. In 2003, the original scriptwriter, Steve Bright, drew it, until 2007. Sporadically from 2007 to 2010 the character appeared in reprinted strips from the John Geering era. For a short time, in the end of 2008, artist Chris McGhie reinvented Bananaman in a series of new strips.

McGhie&#x27;s other work included The Three Bears for &quot;The Beano&quot; (in 2002) and the characters on Yoplait&#x27;s &#x27;Wildlife&#x27; product range. Two new strips drawn by Barrie Appleby appeared that year as well.

Following the &quot;Dandy&quot; revamp of October 2010, Wayne Thompson took over drawing Bananaman in a style reminiscent of French cartoonist Lisa Mandel. Thompson was a popular artist in &quot;The Dandy&quot; who had previously drawn Jak, Agent Dog 3-Zero and, occasionally, Bully Beef and Chips.

In Issue 3515, Thompson&#x27;s style changed notably, becoming more cartoonish and detailed. As of spring 2011, Thompson&#x27;s version of Bananaman appears in full colour over two pages. From 1983 to 1986, Bananaman also had his own annual. This was unusual because, unlike many other comics at the time, &quot;Nutty&quot; never had an annual.

Unlike Dennis the Menace and Bash Street Kids, which mostly consisted of reprints, all the material in these annuals was new. In Issue 3618, dated 14 January 2012, Bananaman made his debut appearance, as John Geering reprints, in &quot;The Beano&quot;; however, he continued to appear in &quot;The Dandy&quot;. Another &quot;Beano&quot; character, Bananagirl of &quot;Super School&quot;, was revealed to be his cousin.

The Dandy print comic ended in December 2012, but Bananaman was still seen in the digital version drawn by Andy Janes. New Bananaman strips drawn by Wayne Thompson and written by Nigel Auchterlounie, Kev F Sutherland and lately Cavan Scott continued to run in &quot;The Beano&quot; throughout 2014.

In 2016, writing duties for the strip were taken over by Tommy Donbavand and Danny Pearson, and since 2018, Bananaman has been written by Ned Hartley.

==Character==
In the strip, Eric Wimp, an ordinary schoolboy living at 29 Acacia Road, Nuttytown (later changed to Dandytown and then Beanotown when the strip moved to other comics), eats a banana to transform into Bananaman, an adult superhero, sporting a distinctive cowled blue and yellow outfit complete with a yellow two-tailed cape resembling a banana skin.

His superpowers include the ability to fly, superhuman strength (often quoted as &quot;twenty men... twenty &quot;big&quot; men&quot; but sometimes limitless, with &quot;nerks&quot;, &quot;women&quot; and &quot;snowmen&quot; all being used in place of &quot;men&quot;), and seeming invulnerability.

This is offset by the fact that he is just as naive and foolish (if not more so) as his alter ego; as mentioned in the comic once or twice, he has the &quot;muscles of twenty men and the brains of twenty mussels&quot;.

If Bananaman needs extra power, bananas can be eaten for strength boosts, provided by his faithful pet crow; if he does not have enough strength to shatter an ice block, for example, after eating another banana, he will have enough. If he eats many bananas in one sitting, he quickly becomes obese in his transformation; if he eats bananas that are not full, he transforms with extra weight in the lower part of his body.

There have also been comics where he has eaten a variant on normal bananas, and transforms differently, reflecting the difference in that banana. The effects of eating the bananas are not consistent from story to story. In one Beano issue with Eric unable to find a banana, he resorted to drinking banana milk, becoming a liquid, totally useless version of Bananaman who later in the story is mopped up by a janitor.

==Varying origins==
Eric Wimp was rocketed to Earth from the Moon as a baby, and gained his powers because the crescent moon resembles a banana. Bananaman resembles Superman in having a kryptonite style weakness to mouldy bananas, and a Fortress of Solitude style building at the North Pole, made out of a giant banana.

During early board meetings, the designers thought of having Bananagirl accompany the series. The girl would have been called Margaret Wimp, and be the &quot;sister&quot; of Eric. This idea was scrapped later in production, because the concept of two children being related without parents would be too far-fetched for children to understand; however, the idea was revived for a Beano comic strip.

In the 1991 &quot;Dandy Annual&quot;, Bananaman&#x27;s origin was changed to that of being a normal Earth baby in a maternity hospital, who obtained his powers after unintentionally eating a banana in which General Blight had hidden a stolen supply of &#x27;Saturnium&#x27;, and accidentally left it next to Eric. However, later issues referred to the first origin as the real one.

==Other characters==
Bananaman initially faced a different pastiche supervillain each week, who were often lampoons of the kind of single issue, uncreatively named villains that heroes fought during the Silver Age, or tips of the hat to famous supervillains. Bananaman&#x27;s arch enemy is General Blight, a parody of Adolf Hitler and generic criminal mastermind who in later strips largely replaced the criminal of the week.

Other villains included mad scientist Doctor Gloom, Bananaman&#x27;s evil fruit counterpart Appleman, the mischief making Weatherman and dessert fiend Captain Cream.

Eric&#x27;s punk-style shaved head was replaced by a more typical 1980s-style haircut, Bananaman gained a talking crow sidekick called simply Crow, and Bananaman became so stupid he often forgot how to fly or to use the door. Eventually, Bananaman even began to go to school despite being an adult.

Bananaman is allied with Chief O&#x27;Reilly, a stereotyped Irish policeman (apparently in homage to Batman&#x27;s James Gordon or the equally stereotyped Chief O&#x27;Hara in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series). He used to wear an Indian feather headdress as a visual pun on &quot;Chief&quot;, and in later strips wore a hat with a flashing blue light on the top.

Chief works in a police station shaped like a giant police helmet, which frequently has to be rebuilt after Bananaman accidentally destroys it. O&#x27;Reilly rings up Eric to get him to talk to Bananaman, presumably thinking Eric is Bananaman&#x27;s assistant of some kind, as in the cartoon series it is made clear that the Chief is not aware of Eric&#x27;s being the superhero.

==Television cartoon series==
From 1983 to 1986, the BBC aired a cartoon series based on Bananaman and featuring the voices of the members of The Goodies. It was produced by 101 Productions. Parts of the character were changed for the series: he was now called Eric Twinge, had a distinctive banana-shaped hairstyle rather than punk stubble, and had a love interest (only when transformed) in the form of Fiona, a newsreader based on Selina Scott and also a possible homage to Lois Lane.

Graeme Garden (incorrectly credited as &quot;Greame&quot; Garden on some episodes) voiced the characters of Bananaman, General Blight and Maurice of The Heavy Mob, Bill Oddie voiced the characters of Crow, Chief O&#x27;Reilly, Doctor Gloom and the Weatherman, and Tim Brooke-Taylor voiced the characters of Eric, King Zorg of the Nerks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie, and Appleman, as well as narrating the episodes.

Jill Shilling voiced Fiona and any additional female characters, including Eric&#x27;s cousin Samantha (but not her mother Auntie). The programme lasted for forty episodes between 3 October 1983 and 15 April 1986.

&quot;Bananaman&quot; was aired in the United States by the Nickelodeon cable network, as a companion piece to &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, but &quot;Bananaman&quot; never came close to reaching that series&#x27; American popularity. The show also aired during the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s (ABC) after-school timeslot, and is considered one of the Classic ABC shows.

In 1997, some episodes of &quot;Bananaman&quot; were used on the cartoon series &quot;The Pepe and Paco Show&quot;, created by Henson International Television.

Some of these episodes would eventually reappear in print form in &quot;The Dandy&quot; in 1998, coinciding with the BBC repeating the series that year, and were reprinted in the comic in the spring of 2007, now promoting the DVD. Each episode was roughly five minutes long. Phrases from the show, &quot;twenty big men&quot; and &quot;ever alert for the call to action&quot;, are still used in the comic today.

On 22 February 2021, Fox Entertainment announced that they would be producing a new &quot;Bananaman&quot; series with Bento Box Entertainment.

==Film adaptation==
In March 2014, it was announced that DC Thomson, in conjunction with Elstree Studio Productions, would be producing a movie on &quot;Bananaman&quot;, with a release date in 2015. In May 2014, DC Thomson unveiled the first teaser poster for the film. By September 2015, the official website stated &quot;coming soon&quot; instead of 2015. In September 2015, it was announced that the movie was in the early stages.

In January 2016, the &quot;Bananaman&quot; musical&#x27;s page on Facebook posted that the movie adaptation is now in development, saying &quot;This fruitiest of superheroes is experiencing a revival elsewhere – &quot;Bananaman The Movie&quot; is also in development&quot;. However, a release date was not mentioned.

On 8 June 2016, the now newly formed Beano Studios issued a press release. The release noted that Beano Studios was formed to bring their properties to life through television, film and live performances based upon present projects which were being worked on. &quot;Beano Studios is currently also exploring plans to take Beano characters to the bigger screens and stages worldwide.&quot;

By June 2017, the official site had been removed.

==Musical production==
Near the beginning of January 2016, it was reported that &quot;Bananaman&quot; would be turned into a musical for West End. An industry launch took place on 2 February 2016, showcasing the musical. The musical ran from the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018, at the Southwark Playhouse in London. It is unknown if it will be produced worldwide.

<doc id="395885" wikidata="Q6553407" url="?curid=395885" title="Linear algebraic group">
<text>In mathematics, a linear algebraic group is a subgroup of the group of invertible formula_1 matrices (under matrix multiplication) that is defined by polynomial equations. An example is the orthogonal group, defined by the relation formula_2 where formula_3 is the transpose of formula_4.

Many Lie groups can be viewed as linear algebraic groups over the field of real or complex numbers. (For example, every compact Lie group can be regarded as a linear algebraic group over R (necessarily R-anisotropic and reductive), as can many noncompact groups such as the simple Lie group SL(&quot;n&quot;,[[Linear algebraic group|R]]).) The simple Lie groups were classified by Wilhelm Killing and Élie Cartan in the 1880s and 1890s. At that time, no special use was made of the fact that the group structure can be defined by polynomials, that is, that these are algebraic groups. The founders of the theory of algebraic groups include Maurer, Chevalley, and . In the 1950s, Armand Borel constructed much of the theory of algebraic groups as it exists today.

One of the first uses for the theory was to define the Chevalley groups.

==Examples==
For a positive integer formula_5, the general linear group formula_6 over a field formula_7, consisting of all invertible formula_1 matrices, is a linear algebraic group over formula_7. It contains the subgroups 
:formula_10
consisting of matrices of the form, resp.,
:formula_11 and formula_12.
The group formula_13 is an example of a unipotent linear algebraic group, the group formula_14 is an example of a solvable algebraic group called the Borel subgroup of formula_6. It is a consequence of the Lie-Kolchin theorem that any connected solvable subgroup of formula_16 is conjugated into formula_14. Any unipotent subgroup can be conjugated into formula_13.

Another algebraic subgroup of formula_16 is the special linear group formula_20 of matrices with determinant 1.

The group formula_21 is called the multiplicative group, usually denoted by formula_22. The group of formula_7-points formula_24 is the multiplicative group formula_25 of nonzero elements of the field formula_7. The additive group formula_27, whose formula_7-points are isomorphic to the additive group of formula_7, can also be expressed as a matrix group, for example as the subgroup formula_13 in formula_31 : 
:formula_32

These two basic examples of commutative linear algebraic groups, the multiplicative and additive groups, behave very differently in terms of their linear representations (as algebraic groups). Every representation of the multiplicative group formula_33 is a direct sum of irreducible representations. (Its irreducible representations all have dimension 1, of the form formula_34 for an integer formula_5.) By contrast, the only irreducible representation of the additive group formula_27 is the trivial representation. So every representation of formula_27 (such as the 2-dimensional representation above) is an iterated extension of trivial representations, not a direct sum (unless the representation is trivial). The structure theory of linear algebraic groups analyzes any linear algebraic group in terms of these two basic groups and their generalizations, tori and unipotent groups, as discussed below.

==Definitions==
For an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot;, much of the structure of an algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is encoded in its set &quot;X&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of &quot;k&quot;-rational points, which allows an elementary definition of a linear algebraic group. First, define a function from the abstract group &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) to &quot;k&quot; to be regular if it can be written as a polynomial in the entries of an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; and in 1/det(&quot;A&quot;), where det is the determinant. Then a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot; is a subgroup &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of the abstract group &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) for some natural number &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is defined by the vanishing of some set of regular functions.

For an arbitrary field &quot;k&quot;, algebraic varieties over &quot;k&quot; are defined as a special case of schemes over &quot;k&quot;. In that language, a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is a smooth closed subgroup scheme of &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over &quot;k&quot; for some natural number &quot;n&quot;. In particular, &quot;G&quot; is defined by the vanishing of some set of regular functions on &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over &quot;k&quot;, and these functions must have the property that for every commutative &quot;k&quot;-algebra &quot;R&quot;, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is a subgroup of the abstract group &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;R&quot;). (Thus an algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is not just the abstract group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), but rather the whole family of groups &quot;G&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) for commutative &quot;k&quot;-algebras &quot;R&quot;; this is the philosophy of describing a scheme by its functor of points.)

In either language, one has the notion of a homomorphism of linear algebraic groups. For example, when &quot;k&quot; is algebraically closed, a homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; ⊂ &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) to &quot;H&quot; ⊂ &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a homomorphism of abstract groups &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) which is defined by regular functions on &quot;G&quot;. This makes the linear algebraic groups over &quot;k&quot; into a category. In particular, this defines what it means for two linear algebraic groups to be isomorphic.

In the language of schemes, a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is in particular a group scheme over &quot;k&quot;, meaning a scheme over &quot;k&quot; together with a &quot;k&quot;-point 1 ∈ &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) and morphisms 
:formula_38
over &quot;k&quot; which satisfy the usual axioms for the multiplication and inverse maps in a group (associativity, identity, inverses). A linear algebraic group is also smooth and of finite type over &quot;k&quot;, and it is affine (as a scheme). Conversely, every affine group scheme &quot;G&quot; of finite type over a field &quot;k&quot; has a faithful representation into &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over &quot;k&quot; for some &quot;n&quot;. An example is the embedding of the additive group &quot;G&quot;&quot;a&quot; into &quot;GL&quot;(2), as mentioned above. As a result, one can think of linear algebraic groups either as matrix groups or, more abstractly, as smooth affine group schemes over a field. (Some authors use &quot;linear algebraic group&quot; to mean any affine group scheme of finite type over a field.)

For a full understanding of linear algebraic groups, one has to consider more general (non-smooth) group schemes. For example, let &quot;k&quot; be an algebraically closed field of characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0. Then the homomorphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot; → &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot; defined by &quot;x&quot; ↦ &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; induces an isomorphism of abstract groups &quot;k&quot;* → &quot;k&quot;*, but &quot;f&quot; is not an isomorphism of algebraic groups (because &quot;x&quot;1/&quot;p&quot; is not a regular function). In the language of group schemes, there is a clearer reason why &quot;f&quot; is not an isomorphism: &quot;f&quot; is surjective, but it has nontrivial kernel, namely the group scheme μ&quot;p&quot; of &quot;p&quot;th roots of unity. This issue does not arise in characteristic zero. Indeed, every group scheme of finite type over a field &quot;k&quot; of characteristic zero is smooth over &quot;k&quot;. A group scheme of finite type over any field &quot;k&quot; is smooth over &quot;k&quot; if and only if it is geometrically reduced, meaning that the base change formula_39 is reduced, where formula_40 is an algebraic closure of &quot;k&quot;.

Since an affine scheme &quot;X&quot; is determined by its ring &quot;O&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of regular functions, an affine group scheme &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is determined by the ring &quot;O&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) with its structure of a Hopf algebra (coming from the multiplication and inverse maps on &quot;G&quot;). This gives an equivalence of categories (reversing arrows) between affine group schemes over &quot;k&quot; and commutative Hopf algebras over &quot;k&quot;. For example, the Hopf algebra corresponding to the multiplicative group &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot; = &quot;GL&quot;(1) is the Laurent polynomial ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;−1], with comultiplication given by
:formula_41

===Basic notions===
For a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, the identity component &quot;G&quot;o (the connected component containing the point 1) is a normal subgroup of finite index. So there is a group extension
:formula_42
where &quot;F&quot; is a finite algebraic group. (For &quot;k&quot; algebraically closed, &quot;F&quot; can be identified with an abstract finite group.) Because of this, the study of algebraic groups mostly focuses on connected groups.

Various notions from abstract group theory can be extended to linear algebraic groups. It is straightforward to define what it means for a linear algebraic group to be commutative, nilpotent, or solvable, by analogy with the definitions in abstract group theory. For example, a linear algebraic group is solvable if it has a composition series of linear algebraic subgroups such that the quotient groups are commutative. Also, the normalizer, the center, and the centralizer of a closed subgroup &quot;H&quot; of a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; are naturally viewed as closed subgroup schemes of &quot;G&quot;. If they are smooth over &quot;k&quot;, then they are linear algebraic groups as defined above.

One may ask to what extent the properties of a connected linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; are determined by the abstract group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). A useful result in this direction is that if the field &quot;k&quot; is perfect (for example, of characteristic zero), &quot;or&quot; if &quot;G&quot; is reductive (as defined below), then &quot;G&quot; is unirational over &quot;k&quot;. Therefore, if in addition &quot;k&quot; is infinite, the group &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is Zariski dense in &quot;G&quot;. For example, under the assumptions mentioned, &quot;G&quot; is commutative, nilpotent, or solvable if and only if &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) has the corresponding property.

The assumption of connectedness cannot be omitted in these results. For example, let &quot;G&quot; be the group μ&quot;3&quot; ⊂ &quot;GL&quot;(1) of cube roots of unity over the rational numbers Q. Then &quot;G&quot; is a linear algebraic group over Q for which &quot;G&quot;(Q) = 1 is not Zariski dense in &quot;G&quot;, because formula_43 is a group of order 3.

Over an algebraically closed field, there is a stronger result about algebraic groups as algebraic varieties: every connected linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field is a rational variety.

==The Lie algebra of an algebraic group==
The Lie algebra formula_44 of an algebraic group &quot;G&quot; can be defined in several equivalent ways: as the tangent space &quot;T&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) at the identity element 1 ∈ &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), or as the space of left-invariant derivations. If &quot;k&quot; is algebraically closed, a derivation &quot;D&quot;: &quot;O&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) → &quot;O&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) over &quot;k&quot; of the coordinate ring of &quot;G&quot; is left-invariant if
:formula_45
for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), where λ&quot;x&quot;: &quot;O&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) → &quot;O&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is induced by left multiplication by &quot;x&quot;. For an arbitrary field &quot;k&quot;, left invariance of a derivation is defined as an analogous equality of two linear maps &quot;O&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) → &quot;O&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) ⊗&quot;O&quot;(&quot;G&quot;). The Lie bracket of two derivations is defined by [&quot;D&quot;1, &quot;D&quot;2] =&quot;D&quot;1&quot;D&quot;2 − &quot;D&quot;2&quot;D&quot;1.

The passage from &quot;G&quot; to formula_44 is thus a process of differentiation. For an element &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), the derivative at 1 ∈ &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of the conjugation map &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, &quot;g&quot; ↦ &quot;xgx&quot;−1, is an automorphism of formula_44, giving the adjoint representation:
:formula_48

Over a field of characteristic zero, a connected subgroup &quot;H&quot; of a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; is uniquely determined by its Lie algebra formula_49. But not every Lie subalgebra of formula_44 corresponds to an algebraic subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, as one sees in the example of the torus &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;)2 over C. In positive characteristic, there can be many different connected subgroups of a group &quot;G&quot; with the same Lie algebra (again, the torus &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;)2 provides examples). For these reasons, although the Lie algebra of an algebraic group is important, the structure theory of algebraic groups requires more global tools.

==Semisimple and unipotent elements==

For an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot;, a matrix &quot;g&quot; in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is called semisimple if it is diagonalizable, and unipotent if the matrix &quot;g&quot; − 1 is nilpotent. Equivalently, &quot;g&quot; is unipotent if all eigenvalues of &quot;g&quot; are equal to 1. The Jordan canonical form for matrices implies that every element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) can be written uniquely as a product &quot;g&quot; = &quot;g&quot;ss&quot;g&quot;u such that &quot;g&quot;ss is semisimple, &quot;g&quot;u is unipotent, and &quot;g&quot;&quot;ss&quot; and &quot;g&quot;u commute with each other.

For any field &quot;k&quot;, an element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) is said to be semisimple if it becomes diagonalizable over the algebraic closure of &quot;k&quot;. If the field &quot;k&quot; is perfect, then the semisimple and unipotent parts of &quot;g&quot; also lie in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;). Finally, for any linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; ⊂ &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over a field &quot;k&quot;, define a &quot;k&quot;-point of &quot;G&quot; to be semisimple or unipotent if it is semisimple or unipotent in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;). (These properties are in fact independent of the choice of a faithful representation of &quot;G&quot;.) If the field &quot;k&quot; is perfect, then the semisimple and unipotent parts of a &quot;k&quot;-point of &quot;G&quot; are automatically in &quot;G&quot;. That is (the Jordan decomposition): every element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) can be written uniquely as a product &quot;g&quot; = &quot;g&quot;ss&quot;g&quot;u in &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) such that &quot;g&quot;ss is semisimple, &quot;g&quot;u is unipotent, and &quot;g&quot;&quot;ss&quot; and &quot;g&quot;u commute with each other. This reduces the problem of describing the conjugacy classes in &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) to the semisimple and unipotent cases.

A torus over an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot; means a group isomorphic to (&quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;)&quot;n&quot;, the product of &quot;n&quot; copies of the multiplicative group over &quot;k&quot;, for some natural number &quot;n&quot;. For a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot;, a maximal torus in &quot;G&quot; means a torus in &quot;G&quot; that is not contained in any bigger torus. For example, the group of diagonal matrices in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over &quot;k&quot; is a maximal torus in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), isomorphic to (&quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;)&quot;n&quot;. A basic result of the theory is that any two maximal tori in a group &quot;G&quot; over an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot; are conjugate by some element of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). The rank of &quot;G&quot; means the dimension of any maximal torus.

For an arbitrary field &quot;k&quot;, a torus &quot;T&quot; over &quot;k&quot; means a linear algebraic group over &quot;k&quot; whose base change formula_51 to the algebraic closure of &quot;k&quot; is isomorphic to (&quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;)&quot;n&quot; over formula_40, for some natural number &quot;n&quot;. A split torus over &quot;k&quot; means a group isomorphic to (&quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;)&quot;n&quot; over &quot;k&quot; for some &quot;n&quot;. An example of a non-split torus over the real numbers R is
:formula_53
with group structure given by the formula for multiplying complex numbers &quot;x&quot;+&quot;iy&quot;. Here &quot;T&quot; is a torus of dimension 1 over R. It is not split, because its group of real points &quot;T&quot;(R) is the circle group, which is not isomorphic even as an abstract group to &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;(R) = R*.

Every point of a torus over a field &quot;k&quot; is semisimple. Conversely, if &quot;G&quot; is a connected linear algebraic group such that every element of formula_54 is semisimple, then &quot;G&quot; is a torus.

For a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a general field &quot;k&quot;, one cannot expect all maximal tori in &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; to be conjugate by elements of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). For example, both the multiplicative group &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot; and the circle group &quot;T&quot; above occur as maximal tori in &quot;SL&quot;(2) over R. However, it is always true that any two maximal split tori in &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; (meaning split tori in &quot;G&quot; that are not contained in a bigger &quot;split&quot; torus) are conjugate by some element of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). As a result, it makes sense to define the &quot;k&quot;-rank or split rank of a group &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; as the dimension of any maximal split torus in &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot;.

For any maximal torus &quot;T&quot; in a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, Grothendieck showed that formula_51 is a maximal torus in formula_39. It follows that any two maximal tori in &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; have the same dimension, although they need not be isomorphic.

==Unipotent groups==
Let &quot;U&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the group of upper-triangular matrices in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) with diagonal entries equal to 1, over a field &quot;k&quot;. A group scheme over a field &quot;k&quot; (for example, a linear algebraic group) is called unipotent if it is isomorphic to a closed subgroup scheme of &quot;U&quot;&quot;n&quot; for some &quot;n&quot;. It is straightforward to check that the group &quot;U&quot;&quot;n&quot; is nilpotent. As a result, every unipotent group scheme is nilpotent.

A linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is unipotent if and only if every element of formula_57 is unipotent.

The group &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; of upper-triangular matrices in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a semidirect product
:formula_58
where &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the diagonal torus (&quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot;)&quot;n&quot;. More generally, every connected solvable linear algebraic group is a semidirect product of a torus with a unipotent group, &quot;T&quot; ⋉ &quot;U&quot;.

A smooth connected unipotent group over a perfect field &quot;k&quot; (for example, an algebraically closed field) has a composition series with all quotient groups isomorphic to the additive group &quot;G&quot;&quot;a&quot;.

==Borel subgroups==
The Borel subgroups are important for the structure theory of linear algebraic groups. For a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot;, a Borel subgroup of &quot;G&quot; means a maximal smooth connected solvable subgroup. For example, one Borel subgroup of &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the subgroup &quot;B&quot; of upper-triangular matrices (all entries below the diagonal are zero).

A basic result of the theory is that any two Borel subgroups of a connected group &quot;G&quot; over an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot; are conjugate by some element of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). (A standard proof uses the Borel fixed-point theorem: for a connected solvable group &quot;G&quot; acting on a proper variety &quot;X&quot; over an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot;, there is a &quot;k&quot;-point in &quot;X&quot; which is fixed by the action of &quot;G&quot;.) The conjugacy of Borel subgroups in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) amounts to the Lie–Kolchin theorem: every smooth connected solvable subgroup of &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is conjugate to a subgroup of the upper-triangular subgroup in &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

For an arbitrary field &quot;k&quot;, a Borel subgroup &quot;B&quot; of &quot;G&quot; is defined to be a subgroup over &quot;k&quot; such that, over an algebraic closure formula_40 of &quot;k&quot;, formula_60 is a Borel subgroup of formula_39. Thus &quot;G&quot; may or may not have a Borel subgroup over &quot;k&quot;.

For a closed subgroup scheme &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, the quotient space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is a smooth quasi-projective scheme over &quot;k&quot;. A smooth subgroup &quot;P&quot; of a connected group &quot;G&quot; is called parabolic if &quot;G&quot;/&quot;P&quot; is projective over &quot;k&quot; (or equivalently, proper over &quot;k&quot;). An important property of Borel subgroups &quot;B&quot; is that &quot;G&quot;/&quot;B&quot; is a projective variety, called the flag variety of &quot;G&quot;. That is, Borel subgroups are parabolic subgroups. More precisely, for &quot;k&quot; algebraically closed, the Borel subgroups are exactly the minimal parabolic subgroups of &quot;G&quot;; conversely, every subgroup containing a Borel subgroup is parabolic. So one can list all parabolic subgroups of &quot;G&quot; (up to conjugation by &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)) by listing all the linear algebraic subgroups of &quot;G&quot; that contain a fixed Borel subgroup. For example, the subgroups &quot;P&quot; ⊂ &quot;GL&quot;(3) over &quot;k&quot; that contain the Borel subgroup &quot;B&quot; of upper-triangular matrices are &quot;B&quot; itself, the whole group &quot;GL&quot;(3), and the intermediate subgroups
:formula_62 and formula_63
The corresponding projective homogeneous varieties &quot;GL&quot;(3)/&quot;P&quot; are (respectively): the flag manifold of all chains of linear subspaces
:formula_64
with &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; of dimension &quot;i&quot;; a point; the projective space P2 of lines (1-dimensional linear subspaces) in &quot;A&quot;3; and the dual projective space P2 of planes in &quot;A&quot;3.

==Semisimple and reductive groups==

A connected linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over an algebraically closed field is called semisimple if every smooth connected solvable normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot; is trivial. More generally, a connected linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over an algebraically closed field is called reductive if every smooth connected unipotent normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot; is trivial. (Some authors do not require reductive groups to be connected.) A semisimple group is reductive. A group &quot;G&quot; over an arbitrary field &quot;k&quot; is called semisimple or reductive if formula_39 is semisimple or reductive. For example, the group &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices with determinant 1 over any field &quot;k&quot; is semisimple, whereas a nontrivial torus is reductive but not semisimple. Likewise, &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is reductive but not semisimple (because its center &quot;G&quot;&quot;m&quot; is a nontrivial smooth connected solvable normal subgroup).

Every compact connected Lie group has a complexification, which is a complex reductive algebraic group. In fact, this construction gives a one-to-one correspondence between compact connected Lie groups and complex reductive groups, up to isomorphism.

A linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is called simple (or &quot;k&quot;-simple) if it is semisimple, nontrivial, and every smooth connected normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is trivial or equal to &quot;G&quot;. (Some authors call this property &quot;almost simple&quot;.) This differs slightly from the terminology for abstract groups, in that a simple algebraic group may have nontrivial center (although the center must be finite). For example, for any integer &quot;n&quot; at least 2 and any field &quot;k&quot;, the group &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) over &quot;k&quot; is simple, and its center is the group scheme μ&quot;n&quot; of &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity.

Every connected linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over a perfect field &quot;k&quot; is (in a unique way) an extension of a reductive group &quot;R&quot; by a smooth connected unipotent group &quot;U&quot;, called the unipotent radical of &quot;G&quot;:
:formula_66
If &quot;k&quot; has characteristic zero, then one has the more precise Levi decomposition: every connected linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is a semidirect product formula_67 of a reductive group by a unipotent group.

==Classification of reductive groups==

Reductive groups include the most important linear algebraic groups in practice, such as the classical groups: &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), &quot;SL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), the orthogonal groups &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and the symplectic groups &quot;Sp&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;). On the other hand, the definition of reductive groups is quite &quot;negative&quot;, and it is not clear that one can expect to say much about them. Remarkably, Claude Chevalley gave a complete classification of the reductive groups over an algebraically closed field: they are determined by root data. In particular, simple groups over an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot; are classified (up to quotients by finite central subgroup schemes) by their Dynkin diagrams. It is striking that this classification is independent of the characteristic of &quot;k&quot;. For example, the exceptional Lie groups &quot;G&quot;2, &quot;F&quot;4, &quot;E&quot;6, &quot;E&quot;7, and &quot;E&quot;8 can be defined in any characteristic (and even as group schemes over Z). The classification of finite simple groups says that most finite simple groups arise as the group of &quot;k&quot;-points of a simple algebraic group over a finite field &quot;k&quot;, or as minor variants of that construction.

Every reductive group over a field is the quotient by a finite central subgroup scheme of the product of a torus and some simple groups. For example,
:formula_68

For an arbitrary field &quot;k&quot;, a reductive group &quot;G&quot; is called split if it contains a split maximal torus over &quot;k&quot; (that is, a split torus in &quot;G&quot; which remains maximal over an algebraic closure of &quot;k&quot;). For example, &quot;GL&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a split reductive group over any field &quot;k&quot;. Chevalley showed that the classification of &quot;split&quot; reductive groups is the same over any field. By contrast, the classification of arbitrary reductive groups can be hard, depending on the base field. For example, every nondegenerate quadratic form &quot;q&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; determines a reductive group &quot;SO&quot;(&quot;q&quot;), and every central simple algebra &quot;A&quot; over &quot;k&quot; determines a reductive group &quot;SL&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;). As a result, the problem of classifying reductive groups over &quot;k&quot; essentially includes the problem of classifying all quadratic forms over &quot;k&quot; or all central simple algebras over &quot;k&quot;. These problems are easy for &quot;k&quot; algebraically closed, and they are understood for some other fields such as number fields, but for arbitrary fields there are many open questions.

==Applications==
===Representation theory===
One reason for the importance of reductive groups comes from representation theory. Every irreducible representation of a unipotent group is trivial. More generally, for any linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; written as an extension
:formula_69
with &quot;U&quot; unipotent and &quot;R&quot; reductive, every irreducible representation of &quot;G&quot; factors through &quot;R&quot;. This focuses attention on the representation theory of reductive groups. (To be clear, the representations considered here are representations of &quot;G&quot; &quot;as an algebraic group&quot;. Thus, for a group &quot;G&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, the representations are on &quot;k&quot;-vector spaces, and the action of &quot;G&quot; is given by regular functions. It is an important but different problem to classify continuous representations of the group &quot;G&quot;(R) for a real reductive group &quot;G&quot;, or similar problems over other fields.)

Chevalley showed that the irreducible representations of a split reductive group over a field &quot;k&quot; are finite-dimensional, and they are indexed by dominant weights. This is the same as what happens in the representation theory of compact connected Lie groups, or the finite-dimensional representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras. For &quot;k&quot; of characteristic zero, all these theories are essentially equivalent. In particular, every representation of a reductive group &quot;G&quot; over a field of characteristic zero is a direct sum of irreducible representations, and if &quot;G&quot; is split, the characters of the irreducible representations are given by the Weyl character formula. The Borel–Weil theorem gives a geometric construction of the irreducible representations of a reductive group &quot;G&quot; in characteristic zero, as spaces of sections of line bundles over the flag manifold &quot;G&quot;/&quot;B&quot;.

The representation theory of reductive groups (other than tori) over a field of positive characteristic &quot;p&quot; is less well understood. In this situation, a representation need not be a direct sum of irreducible representations. And although irreducible representations are indexed by dominant weights, the dimensions and characters of the irreducible representations are known only in some cases. determined these characters (proving Lusztig&#x27;s conjecture) when the characteristic &quot;p&quot; is sufficiently large compared to the Coxeter number of the group. For small primes &quot;p&quot;, there is not even a precise conjecture.

===Group actions and geometric invariant theory===
An action of a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; on a variety (or scheme) &quot;X&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is a morphism
:formula_70
that satisfies the axioms of a group action. As in other types of group theory, it is important to study group actions, since groups arise naturally as symmetries of geometric objects.

Part of the theory of group actions is geometric invariant theory, which aims to construct a quotient variety &quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot;, describing the set of orbits of a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; on &quot;X&quot; as an algebraic variety. Various complications arise. For example, if &quot;X&quot; is an affine variety, then one can try to construct &quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot; as Spec of the ring of invariants &quot;O&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)&quot;G&quot;. However, Masayoshi Nagata showed that the ring of invariants need not be finitely generated as a &quot;k&quot;-algebra (and so Spec of the ring is a scheme but not a variety), a negative answer to Hilbert&#x27;s 14th problem. In the positive direction, the ring of invariants is finitely generated if &quot;G&quot; is reductive, by Haboush&#x27;s theorem, proved in characteristic zero by Hilbert and Nagata.

Geometric invariant theory involves further subtleties when a reductive group &quot;G&quot; acts on a projective variety &quot;X&quot;. In particular, the theory defines open subsets of &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;semistable&quot; points in &quot;X&quot;, with the quotient morphism only defined on the set of semistable points.

==Related notions==
Linear algebraic groups admit variants in several directions. Dropping the existence of the inverse map formula_71, one obtains the notion of a linear algebraic monoid.

===Lie groups===
For a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over the real numbers R, the group of real points &quot;G&quot;(R) is a Lie group, essentially because real polynomials, which describe the multiplication on &quot;G&quot;, are smooth functions. Likewise, for a linear algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over C, &quot;G&quot;(C) is a complex Lie group. Much of the theory of algebraic groups was developed by analogy with Lie groups.

There are several reasons why a Lie group may not have the structure of a linear algebraic group over R.

*A Lie group with an infinite group of components G/Go cannot be realized as a linear algebraic group.
*An algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over R may be connected as an algebraic group while the Lie group &quot;G&quot;(R) is not connected, and likewise for simply connected groups. For example, the algebraic group &quot;SL&quot;(2) is simply connected over any field, whereas the Lie group &quot;SL&quot;(2,R) has fundamental group isomorphic to the integers Z. The double cover &quot;H&quot; of &quot;SL&quot;(2,R), known as the metaplectic group, is a Lie group that cannot be viewed as a linear algebraic group over R. More strongly, &quot;H&quot; has no faithful finite-dimensional representation. 
*Anatoly Maltsev showed that every simply connected nilpotent Lie group can be viewed as a unipotent algebraic group &quot;G&quot; over R in a unique way. (As a variety, &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to affine space of some dimension over R.) By contrast, there are simply connected solvable Lie groups that cannot be viewed as real algebraic groups. For example, the universal cover &quot;H&quot; of the semidirect product &quot;S&quot;1 ⋉ R2 has center isomorphic to Z, which is not a linear algebraic group, and so &quot;H&quot; cannot be viewed as a linear algebraic group over R.

===Abelian varieties===
Algebraic groups which are not affine behave very differently. In particular, a smooth connected group scheme which is a projective variety over a field is called an abelian variety. In contrast to linear algebraic groups, every abelian variety is commutative. Nonetheless, abelian varieties have a rich theory. Even the case of elliptic curves (abelian varieties of dimension 1) is central to number theory, with applications including the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

===Tannakian categories===
The finite-dimensional representations of an algebraic group &quot;G&quot;, together with the tensor product of representations, form a tannakian category Rep&quot;G&quot;. In fact, tannakian categories with a &quot;fiber functor&quot; over a field are equivalent to affine group schemes. (Every affine group scheme over a field &quot;k&quot; is &quot;pro-algebraic&quot; in the sense that it is an inverse limit of affine group schemes of finite type over &quot;k&quot;.) For example, the Mumford–Tate group and the motivic Galois group are constructed using this formalism. Certain properties of a (pro-)algebraic group &quot;G&quot; can be read from its category of representations. For example, over a field of characteristic zero, Rep&quot;G&quot; is a semisimple category if and only if the identity component of &quot;G&quot; is pro-reductive.

<text>The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial relations among 44 countries, including the United States, Canada, Western European countries, and Australia after the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement. The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent states. The Bretton Woods system required countries to guarantee convertibility of their currencies into U.S. dollars to within 1% of fixed parity rates, with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign governments and central banks at US$35 per troy ounce of fine gold (or 0.88867 gram fine gold per dollar). It also envisioned greater cooperation among countries in order to prevent future competitive devaluations, and thus established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to monitor exchange rates and lend reserve currencies to countries with balance of payments deficits.

Preparing to rebuild the international economic system while World War II was still being fought, 730 delegates from all 44 Allied countries gathered at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, also known as the Bretton Woods Conference. The delegates deliberated from 1 to 22 July 1944, and signed the Bretton Woods agreement on its final day. Setting up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the international monetary system, these accords established the IMF and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which today is part of the World Bank Group. The United States, which controlled two-thirds of the world&#x27;s gold, insisted that the Bretton Woods system rest on both gold and the US dollar. Soviet representatives attended the conference but later declined to ratify the final agreements, charging that the institutions they had created were &quot;branches of Wall Street&quot;. These organizations became operational in 1945 after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the agreement. According to Barry Eichengreen, the Bretton Woods system operated successfully due to three factors: &quot;low international capital mobility, tight financial regulation, and the dominant economic and financial position of the United States and the dollar.&quot;

On 15 August 1971, the United States ended the convertibility of the US dollar to gold, effectively bringing the Bretton Woods system to an end and rendering the dollar a fiat currency. Shortly thereafter, many fixed currencies (such as the pound sterling) also became free-floating, and the subsequent era has been characterized by floating exchange rates. The end of Bretton Woods was formally ratified by the Jamaica Accords in 1976.

==Origins==
The planners at Bretton Woods hoped to avoid a repetition of the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, which had created enough economic and political tension to lead to WWII. After World War I, Britain owed the U.S. substantial sums, which Britain could not repay because it had used the funds to support allies such as France during the War; the Allies could not pay back Britain, so Britain could not pay back the U.S. The solution at Versailles for the French, British, and Americans seemed to entail ultimately charging Germany for the debts. If the demands on Germany were unrealistic, then it was unrealistic for France to pay back Britain, and for Britain to pay back the US. Thus, many &quot;assets&quot; on bank balance sheets internationally were actually unrecoverable loans, which culminated in the 1931 banking crisis. Intransigent insistence by creditor countries for the repayment of Allied war debts and reparations, combined with an inclination to isolationism, led to a breakdown of the international financial system and a worldwide economic depression. 

The beggar thy neighbour policies that emerged as the crisis continued saw some trading countries using currency devaluations in an attempt to increase their competitiveness (i.e. raise exports and lower imports), though recent research suggests this de facto inflationary policy probably offset some of the contractionary forces in world price levels (see Eichengreen &quot;How to Prevent a Currency war&quot;).

In the 1920s, international flows of speculative financial capital increased, leading to extremes in balance of payments situations in various European countries and the US. In the 1930s, world markets never broke through the barriers and restrictions on international trade and investment volume – barriers haphazardly constructed, nationally motivated and imposed. The various anarchic and often autarkic protectionist and neo-mercantilist national policies – often mutually inconsistent – that emerged over the first half of the decade worked inconsistently and self-defeatingly to promote national import substitution, increase national exports, divert foreign investment and trade flows, and even prevent certain categories of cross-border trade and investment outright. Global central bankers attempted to manage the situation by meeting with each other, but their understanding of the situation as well as difficulties in communicating internationally, hindered their abilities. The lesson was that simply having responsible, hard-working central bankers was not enough.

Britain in the 1930s had an exclusionary trade bloc with countries and territories of the British Empire known as the Sterling Area. If Britain imported more than it exported to such trading partners, recipients of pounds sterling within these countries tended to put them into London banks. This meant that though Britain was running a trade deficit, it had a financial account surplus, and payments balanced. Increasingly, Britain&#x27;s positive balance of payments required keeping the wealth from across its Empire in British banks. One incentive for, say, South African holders of rand to park their wealth in London and to keep the money in Sterling, was a strongly valued pound sterling. In the 1920s, imports from the US threatened certain parts of the British domestic market for manufactured goods and the way out of the trade deficit was to devalue the currency. But Britain could not devalue, or the Empire surplus would leave its banking system.

Nazi Germany also worked with a bloc of controlled countries by 1940. Germany forced trading partners with a surplus to spend that surplus importing products from Germany. Thus, Britain survived by keeping Sterling-using countries&#x27; surpluses in its banking system, and Germany survived by forcing trading partners to purchase its own products. The U.S. was concerned that a sudden drop-off in war spending might return its population to the unemployment levels of the 1930s, and so wanted Sterling-using countries and everyone in Europe to be able to import from the US, hence the U.S. supported free trade and international convertibility of currencies into gold or dollars.

===Post-war negotiations===

When many of the same experts who observed the 1930s became the architects of a new, unified, post-war system at Bretton Woods, their guiding principles became &quot;no more beggar thy neighbor&quot; and &quot;control flows of speculative financial capital&quot;. Preventing a repetition of this process of competitive devaluations was desired, but in a way that would not force debtor countries to contract their industrial bases by keeping interest rates at a level high enough to attract foreign bank deposits. John Maynard Keynes, wary of repeating the Great Depression, was behind Britain&#x27;s proposal that surplus countries be forced by a &quot;use-it-or-lose-it&quot; mechanism, to either import from debtor states, build factories in debtor states or donate to debtor states. The U.S. opposed Keynes&#x27; plan, and a senior official at the U.S. Treasury, Harry Dexter White, rejected Keynes&#x27; proposals, in favor of an International Monetary Fund with enough resources to counteract destabilizing flows of speculative finance. However, unlike the modern IMF, White&#x27;s proposed fund would have counteracted dangerous speculative flows automatically, with no political strings attached—i.e., no IMF conditionality. Economic historian Brad Delong writes that on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.

Today these key 1930s events look different to scholars of the era (see the work of Barry Eichengreen &quot;Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919–1939&quot; and &quot;How to Prevent a Currency War&quot;); in particular, devaluations today are viewed with more nuance. Ben Bernanke&#x27;s opinion on the subject follows:

... [T]he proximate cause of the world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard. ... For a variety of reasons, including a desire of the Federal Reserve to curb the U.S. stock market boom, monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late 1920s—a contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard. What was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of 1931 instigated an international &quot;scramble for gold&quot;. Sterilization of gold inflows by surplus countries [the U.S. and France], substitution of gold for foreign exchange reserves, and runs on commercial banks all led to increases in the gold backing of money, and consequently to sharp unintended declines in national money supplies. Monetary contractions in turn were strongly associated with falling prices, output and employment. Effective international cooperation could in principle have permitted a worldwide monetary expansion despite gold standard constraints, but disputes over World War I reparations and war debts, and the insularity and inexperience of the Federal Reserve, among other factors, prevented this outcome. As a result, individual countries were able to escape the deflationary vortex only by unilaterally abandoning the gold standard and re-establishing domestic monetary stability, a process that dragged on in a halting and uncoordinated manner until France and the other Gold Bloc countries finally left gold in 1936. —&quot;Great Depression&quot;, B. Bernanke

In 1944 at Bretton Woods, as a result of the collective conventional wisdom of the time, representatives from all the leading allied states collectively favored a regulated system of fixed exchange rates, indirectly disciplined by a US dollar tied to gold—a system that relied on a regulated market economy with tight controls on the values of currencies. Flows of speculative international finance were curtailed by shunting them through and limiting them via central banks. This meant that international flows of investment went into foreign direct investment (FDI)—i.e., construction of factories overseas, rather than international currency manipulation or bond markets. Although the national experts disagreed to some degree on the specific implementation of this system, all agreed on the need for tight controls.

====Economic security====

Also based on experience of the inter-war years, U.S. planners developed a concept of economic security—that a liberal international economic system would enhance the possibilities of postwar peace. One of those who saw such a security link was Cordell Hull, the United States Secretary of State from 1933 to 1944. Hull believed that the fundamental causes of the two world wars lay in economic discrimination and trade warfare. Hull argued

====Rise of governmental intervention====

The developed countries also agreed that the liberal international economic system required governmental intervention. In the aftermath of the Great Depression, public management of the economy had emerged as a primary activity of governments in the developed states. Employment, stability, and growth were now important subjects of public policy.

In turn, the role of government in the national economy had become associated with the assumption by the state of the responsibility for assuring its citizens of a degree of economic well-being. The system of economic protection for at-risk citizens sometimes called the welfare state grew out of the Great Depression, which created a popular demand for governmental intervention in the economy, and out of the theoretical contributions of the Keynesian school of economics, which asserted the need for governmental intervention to counter market imperfections.

However, increased government intervention in domestic economy brought with it isolationist sentiment that had a profoundly negative effect on international economics. The priority of national goals, independent national action in the interwar period, and the failure to perceive that those national goals could not be realized without some form of international collaboration—all resulted in &quot;beggar-thy-neighbor&quot; policies such as high tariffs, competitive devaluations that contributed to the breakdown of the gold-based international monetary system, domestic political instability, and international war. The lesson learned was, as the principal architect of the Bretton Woods system New Dealer Harry Dexter White put it:

To ensure economic stability and political peace, states agreed to cooperate to closely regulate the production of their currencies to maintain fixed exchange rates between countries with the aim of more easily facilitating international trade. This was the foundation of the U.S. vision of postwar world free trade, which also involved lowering tariffs and, among other things, maintaining a balance of trade via fixed exchange rates that would be favorable to the capitalist system.

Thus, the more developed market economies agreed with the U.S. vision of post-war international economic management, which intended to create and maintain an effective international monetary system and foster the reduction of barriers to trade and capital flows. In a sense, the new international monetary system was a return to a system similar to the pre-war gold standard, only using U.S. dollars as the world&#x27;s new reserve currency until international trade reallocated the world&#x27;s gold supply.

Thus, the new system would be devoid (initially) of governments meddling with their currency supply as they had during the years of economic turmoil preceding WWII. Instead, governments would closely police the production of their currencies and ensure that they would not artificially manipulate their price levels. If anything, Bretton Woods was a return to a time devoid of increased governmental intervention in economies and currency systems.

====Atlantic Charter====
The Atlantic Charter, drafted during U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s August 1941 meeting with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on a ship in the North Atlantic, was the most notable precursor to the Bretton Woods Conference. Like Woodrow Wilson before him, whose &quot;Fourteen Points&quot; had outlined U.S. aims in the aftermath of the First World War, Roosevelt set forth a range of ambitious goals for the postwar world even before the U.S. had entered the Second World War.

The Atlantic Charter affirmed the right of all states to equal access to trade and raw materials. Moreover, the charter called for freedom of the seas (a principal U.S. foreign policy aim since France and Britain had first threatened U.S. shipping in the 1790s), the disarmament of aggressors, and the &quot;establishment of a wider and more permanent system of general security&quot;.

As the war drew to a close, the Bretton Woods conference was the culmination of some two and a half years of planning for postwar reconstruction by the Treasuries of the U.S. and the UK. U.S. representatives studied with their British counterparts the reconstitution of what had been lacking between the two world wars: a system of international payments that would let countries trade without fear of sudden currency depreciation or wild exchange rate fluctuations—ailments that had nearly paralyzed world capitalism during the Great Depression.

Without a strong European market for U.S. goods and services, most policymakers believed, the U.S. economy would be unable to sustain the prosperity it had achieved during the war. In addition, U.S. unions had only grudgingly accepted government-imposed restraints on their demands during the war, but they were willing to wait no longer, particularly as inflation cut into the existing wage scales with painful force (by the end of 1945, there had already been major strikes in the automobile, electrical, and steel industries).

In early 1945, Bernard Baruch described the spirit of Bretton Woods as: if we can &quot;stop subsidization of labor and sweated competition in the export markets&quot;, as well as prevent rebuilding of war machines, &quot;oh boy, oh boy, what long term prosperity we will have.&quot; The United States could therefore use its position of influence to reopen and control the rules of the world economy, so as to give unhindered access to all countries&#x27; markets and materials.

====Wartime devastation of Europe and East Asia====
United States allies—economically exhausted by the war—needed U.S. assistance to rebuild their domestic production and to finance their international trade; indeed, they needed it to survive.

Before the war, the French and the British realized that they could no longer compete with U.S. industries in an open marketplace. During the 1930s, the British created their own economic bloc to shut out U.S. goods. Churchill did not believe that he could surrender that protection after the war, so he watered down the Atlantic Charter&#x27;s &quot;free access&quot; clause before agreeing to it.

Yet U.S. officials were determined to open their access to the British empire. The combined value of British and U.S. trade was well over half of all the world&#x27;s trade in goods. For the U.S. to open global markets, it first had to split the British (trade) empire. While Britain had economically dominated the 19th century, U.S. officials intended the second half of the 20th to be under U.S. hegemony.

A senior official of the Bank of England commented:

A devastated Britain had little choice. Two world wars had destroyed the country&#x27;s principal industries that paid for the importation of half of the nation&#x27;s food and nearly all its raw materials except coal. The British had no choice but to ask for aid. Not until the United States signed an agreement on 6 December 1945 to grant Britain aid of $4.4 billion did the British Parliament ratify the Bretton Woods Agreements (which occurred later in December 1945).

==Design of the financial system==
Free trade relied on the free convertibility of currencies. Negotiators at the Bretton Woods conference, fresh from what they perceived as a disastrous experience with floating rates in the 1930s, concluded that major monetary fluctuations could stall the free flow of trade.

The new economic system required an accepted vehicle for investment, trade, and payments. Unlike national economies, however, the international economy lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use. In the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard, but the architects of Bretton Woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy. Instead, they set up a system of fixed exchange rates managed by a series of newly created international institutions using the U.S. dollar (which was a gold standard currency for central banks) as a reserve currency.

===Informal regimes===

====Previous regimes====
In the 19th and early 20th centuries gold played a key role in international monetary transactions. The gold standard was used to back currencies; the international value of currency was determined by its fixed relationship to gold; gold was used to settle international accounts. The gold standard maintained fixed exchange rates that were seen as desirable because they reduced the risk when trading with other countries.

Imbalances in international trade were theoretically rectified automatically by the gold standard. A country with a deficit would have depleted gold reserves and would thus have to reduce its money supply. The resulting fall in demand would reduce imports and the lowering of prices would boost exports; thus, the deficit would be rectified. Any country experiencing inflation would lose gold and therefore would have a decrease in the amount of money available to spend.

This decrease in the amount of money would act to reduce the inflationary pressure. Supplementing the use of gold in this period was the British pound. Based on the dominant British economy, the pound became a reserve, transaction, and intervention currency. But the pound was not up to the challenge of serving as the primary world currency, given the weakness of the British economy after the Second World War.

The architects of Bretton Woods had conceived of a system wherein exchange rate stability was a prime goal. Yet, in an era of more activist economic policy, governments did not seriously consider permanently fixed rates on the model of the classical gold standard of the 19th century. Gold production was not even sufficient to meet the demands of growing international trade and investment. Further, a sizable share of the world&#x27;s known gold reserves was located in the Soviet Union, which would later emerge as a Cold War rival to the United States and Western Europe.

The only currency strong enough to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions was the U.S. dollar. The strength of the U.S. economy, the fixed relationship of the dollar to gold ($35 an ounce), and the commitment of the U.S. government to convert dollars into gold at that price made the dollar as good as gold. In fact, the dollar was even better than gold: it earned interest and it was more flexible than gold.

===Fixed exchange rates===

The rules of Bretton Woods, set forth in the articles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), provided for a system of fixed exchange rates. The rules further sought to encourage an open system by committing members to the convertibility of their respective currencies into other currencies and to free trade.

What emerged was the &quot;pegged rate&quot; currency regime. Members were required to establish a parity of their national currencies in terms of the reserve currency (a &quot;peg&quot;) and to maintain exchange rates within plus or minus 1% of parity (a &quot;band&quot;) by intervening in their foreign exchange markets (that is, buying or selling foreign money).

In theory, the reserve currency would be the bancor (a World Currency Unit that was never implemented), proposed by John Maynard Keynes; however, the United States objected, and their request was granted, making the &quot;reserve currency&quot; the U.S. dollar. This meant that other countries would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, and—once convertibility was restored—would buy and sell U.S. dollars to keep market exchange rates within plus or minus 1% of parity. Thus, the U.S. dollar took over the role that gold had played under the gold standard in the international financial system.

Meanwhile, to bolster confidence in the dollar, the U.S. agreed separately to link the dollar to gold at the rate of $35 per ounce. At this rate, foreign governments and central banks could exchange dollars for gold. Bretton Woods established a system of payments based on the dollar, which defined all currencies in relation to the dollar, itself convertible into gold, and above all, &quot;as good as gold&quot; for trade. U.S. currency was now effectively the world currency, the standard to which every other currency was pegged.

The U.S. dollar was the currency with the most purchasing power and it was the only currency that was backed by gold. Additionally, all European states that had been involved in World War II were highly in debt and transferred large amounts of gold into the United States, a fact that contributed to the supremacy of the United States. Thus, the U.S. dollar was strongly appreciated in the rest of the world and therefore became the key currency of the Bretton Woods system.

Member countries could only change their par value by more than 10% with IMF approval, which was contingent on IMF determination that its balance of payments was in a &quot;fundamental disequilibrium&quot;. The formal definition of fundamental disequilibrium was never determined, leading to uncertainty of approvals and attempts to repeatedly devalue by less than 10% instead. Any country that changed without approval or after being denied approval was denied access to the IMF.

Maintaining the fixed exchange system required countries to maintain sufficient foreign exchange reserves to intervene in markets and prevent fluctuations away from the pegged rate. This also meant that international movement of capital could not be too large (because that might lead to large fluctuations in the exchange rate and necessitate costly market interventions that risked depleting a country&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves).

===Formal regimes===

The Bretton Woods Conference led to the establishment of the IMF and the IBRD (now the World Bank), which remain powerful forces in the world economy as of the 2020s.

A major point of common ground at the Conference was the goal to avoid a recurrence of the closed markets and economic warfare that had characterized the 1930s. Thus, negotiators at Bretton Woods also agreed that there was a need for an institutional forum for international cooperation on monetary matters. Already in 1944, the British economist John Maynard Keynes emphasized &quot;the importance of rule-based regimes to stabilize business expectations&quot;—something he accepted in the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. Currency troubles in the interwar years, it was felt, had been greatly exacerbated by the absence of any established procedure or machinery for intergovernmental consultation.

As a result of the establishment of agreed upon structures and rules of international economic interaction, conflict over economic issues was minimized, and the significance of the economic aspect of international relations seemed to recede.

====International Monetary Fund====

Officially established on 27 December 1945, when the 29 participating countries at the conference of Bretton Woods signed its Articles of Agreement, the IMF was to be the keeper of the rules and the main instrument of public international management. The Fund commenced its financial operations on 1 March 1947. IMF approval was necessary for any change in exchange rates in excess of 10%. It advised countries on policies affecting the monetary system and lent reserve currencies to countries that had incurred balance of payment debts.

=====Design=====

The big question at the Bretton Woods conference with respect to the institution that would emerge as the IMF was the issue of future access to international liquidity and whether that source should be akin to a world central bank able to create new reserves at will or a more limited borrowing mechanism.

Although attended by 44 governments, discussions at the conference were dominated by two rival plans developed by the United States and Britain. Writing to the British Treasury, Keynes, who took the lead at the Conference, did not want many countries. He believed that those from the colonies and semi-colonies had &quot;nothing to contribute and will merely encumber the ground&quot;.

As the chief international economist at the U.S. Treasury in 1942–44, Harry Dexter White drafted the U.S. blueprint for international access to liquidity, which competed with the plan drafted for the British Treasury by Keynes. Overall, White&#x27;s scheme tended to favor incentives designed to create price stability within the world&#x27;s economies, while Keynes wanted a system that encouraged economic growth. The &quot;collective agreement was an enormous international undertaking&quot; that took two years prior to the conference to prepare for. It consisted of numerous bilateral and multilateral meetings to reach common ground on what policies would make up the Bretton Woods system.

At the time, gaps between the White and Keynes plans seemed enormous. White basically wanted a fund to reverse destabilizing flows of financial capital automatically. White proposed a new monetary institution called the Stabilization Fund that &quot;would be funded with a finite pool of national currencies and gold… that would effectively limit the supply of reserve credit&quot;. Keynes wanted incentives for the U.S. to help Britain and the rest of Europe rebuild after WWII. Outlining the difficulty of creating a system that every nation could accept in his speech at the closing plenary session of the Bretton Woods conference on 22 July 1944, Keynes stated:

Keynes&#x27; proposals would have established a world reserve currency (which he thought might be called &quot;bancor&quot;) administered by a central bank vested with the power to create money and with the authority to take actions on a much larger scale.

In the case of balance of payments imbalances, Keynes recommended that &quot;both&quot; debtors and creditors should change their policies. As outlined by Keynes, countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries, build factories in debtor countries, or donate to them—and thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium. Thus, Keynes was sensitive to the problem that placing too much of the burden on the deficit country would be deflationary.

But the United States, as a likely creditor nation, and eager to take on the role of the world&#x27;s economic powerhouse, used White&#x27;s plan but targeted many of Keynes&#x27;s concerns. White saw a role for global intervention in an imbalance only when it was caused by currency speculation.

Although a compromise was reached on some points, because of the overwhelming economic and military power of the United States the participants at Bretton Woods largely agreed on White&#x27;s plan. White’s plan was designed not merely to secure the rise and world economic domination of the United States, but to ensure that as the outgoing superpower Britain would be shuffled even further from centre stage.

=====Subscriptions and quotas=====
What emerged largely reflected U.S. preferences: a system of subscriptions and quotas embedded in the IMF, which itself was to be no more than a fixed pool of national currencies and gold subscribed by each country, as opposed to a world central bank capable of creating money. The Fund was charged with managing various countries&#x27; trade deficits so that they would not produce currency devaluations that would trigger a decline in imports.

The IMF is provided with a fund composed of contributions from member countries in gold and their own currencies. The original quotas were to total $8.8 billion. When joining the IMF, members are assigned &quot;&quot; that reflect their relative economic power—and, as a sort of credit deposit, are obliged to pay a &quot;subscription&quot; of an amount commensurate with the quota. They pay the subscription as 25% in gold or currency convertible into gold (effectively the dollar, which at the founding, was the only currency then still directly gold convertible for central banks) and 75% in their own currency.

Quota subscriptions form the largest source of money at the IMF&#x27;s disposal. The IMF set out to use this money to grant loans to member countries with financial difficulties. Each member is then entitled to withdraw 25% of its quota immediately in case of payment problems. If this sum should be insufficient, each nation in the system is also able to request loans for foreign currency.

=====Trade deficits=====
In the event of a deficit in the current account, Fund members, when short of reserves, would be able to borrow foreign currency in amounts determined by the size of its quota. In other words, the higher the country&#x27;s contribution was, the higher the sum of money it could borrow from the IMF.

Members were required to pay back debts within a period of 18 months to five years. In turn, the IMF embarked on setting up rules and procedures to keep a country from going too deeply into debt year after year. The Fund would exercise &quot;surveillance&quot; over other economies for the U.S. Treasury in return for its loans to prop up national currencies.

IMF loans were not comparable to loans issued by a conventional credit institution. Instead, they were effectively a chance to purchase a foreign currency with gold or the member&#x27;s national currency.

The U.S.-backed IMF plan sought to end restrictions on the transfer of goods and services from one country to another, eliminate currency blocs, and lift currency exchange controls.

The IMF was designed to advance credits to countries with balance of payments deficits. Short-run balance of payment difficulties would be overcome by IMF loans, which would facilitate stable currency exchange rates. This flexibility meant a member state would not have to induce a depression to cut its national income down to such a low level that its imports would finally fall within its means. Thus, countries were to be spared the need to resort to the classical medicine of deflating themselves into drastic unemployment when faced with chronic balance of payments deficits. Before the Second World War, European governments—particularly Britain—often resorted to this.

=====Par value=====
The IMF sought to provide for occasional discontinuous exchange-rate adjustments (changing a member&#x27;s par value) by international agreement. Member states were permitted to adjust their currency exchange rate by 1%. This tended to restore equilibrium in their trade by expanding their exports and contracting imports. This would be allowed only if there was a fundamental disequilibrium. A decrease in the value of a country&#x27;s money was called a devaluation, while an increase in the value of the country&#x27;s money was called a revaluation.

It was envisioned that these changes in exchange rates would be quite rare. However, the concept of fundamental disequilibrium, though key to the operation of the par value system, was never defined in detail.

=====Operations=====
Never before had international monetary cooperation been attempted on a permanent institutional basis. Even more groundbreaking was the decision to allocate voting rights among governments, not on a one-state one-vote basis, but rather in proportion to quotas. Since the United States was contributing the most, U.S. leadership was the key. Under the system of weighted voting, the United States exerted a preponderant influence on the IMF. The United States held one-third of all IMF quotas at the outset, enough on its own to veto all changes to the IMF Charter.

In addition, the IMF was based in Washington, D.C., and staffed mainly by U.S. economists. It regularly exchanged personnel with the U.S. Treasury. When the IMF began operations in 1946, President Harry S. Truman named White as its first U.S. Executive Director. Since no Deputy Managing Director post had yet been created, White served occasionally as Acting Managing Director and generally played a highly influential role during the IMF&#x27;s first year. Truman had to abandon his original plan of naming White as IMF Executive Director when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover submitted a report to the president, asserting that White was &quot;a valuable adjunct to an underground Soviet espionage organization&quot;, who was placing individuals of high regard to Soviet intelligence inside the government.

====International Bank for Reconstruction and Development====

The agreement made no provisions to create international reserves. It assumed new gold production would be sufficient. In the event of structural disequilibria, it expected that there would be national solutions, for example, an adjustment in the value of the currency or an improvement by other means of a country&#x27;s competitive position. The IMF was left with few means, however, to encourage such national solutions.

Economists and other planners recognized in 1944 that the new system could only commence after a return to normality following the disruption of World War II. It was expected that after a brief transition period of no more than five years, the international economy would recover, and the system would enter into operation.

To promote growth of world trade and finance postwar reconstruction of Europe, the planners at Bretton Woods created another institution, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which is one of five agencies that make up the World Bank Group and is perhaps now the most important agency of the Group. The IBRD had an authorized capitalization of $10 billion and was expected to make loans of its own funds to underwrite private loans and to issue securities to raise new funds to make possible a speedy postwar recovery. The IBRD was to be a specialized agency of the United Nations, charged with making loans for economic development purposes.

==Readjustment==

===Dollar shortages and the Marshall Plan===
The Bretton Woods arrangements were largely adhered to and ratified by the participating governments. It was expected that national monetary reserves, supplemented with necessary IMF credits, would finance any temporary balance of payments disequilibria. But this did not prove sufficient to get Europe out of its conundrum.

Postwar world capitalism suffered from a dollar shortage. The United States was running large balance of trade surpluses, and U.S. reserves were immense and growing. It was necessary to reverse this flow. Even though all countries wanted to buy U.S. exports, dollars had to leave the United States and become available for international use so they could do so. In other words, the United States would have to reverse the imbalances in global wealth by running a balance of trade deficit, financed by an outflow of U.S. reserves to other countries (a U.S. financial account deficit). The U.S. could run a financial deficit by either importing from, building plants in, or donating to foreign countries. Speculative investment was discouraged by the Bretton Woods agreement, and importing from other locations was not appealing in the 1950s, because U.S. technology was cutting edge at the time. So, multinational corporations and global aid that originated from the U.S. burgeoned.

The modest credit facilities of the IMF were clearly insufficient to deal with Western Europe&#x27;s huge balance of payments deficits. The problem was further aggravated by the reaffirmation by the IMF Board of Governors of the provision in the Bretton Woods Articles of Agreement that the IMF could make loans only for current account deficits and not for capital and reconstruction purposes. Only the United States contribution of $570 million was actually available for IBRD lending. In addition, because the only available market for IBRD bonds was the conservative Wall Street banking market, the IBRD was forced to adopt a conservative lending policy, granting loans only when repayment was assured. Given these problems, by 1947 the IMF and the IBRD themselves were admitting that they could not deal with the international monetary system&#x27;s economic problems.

The United States set up the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan) to provide large-scale financial and economic aid for rebuilding Europe largely through grants rather than loans. Countries belonging to the Soviet bloc, e.g., Poland were invited to receive the grants, but were given a favorable agreement with the Soviet Union&#x27;s COMECON. In a speech at Harvard University on 5 June 1947, U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall stated:

From 1947 until 1958, the U.S. deliberately encouraged an outflow of dollars, and, from 1950 on, the United States ran a balance of payments deficit with the intent of providing liquidity for the international economy. Dollars flowed out through various U.S. aid programs: the Truman Doctrine entailing aid to the pro-U.S. Greek and Turkish regimes, which were struggling to suppress communist revolution, aid to various pro-U.S. regimes in the Third World, and most importantly, the Marshall Plan. From 1948 to 1954 the United States provided 16 Western European countries with $17 billion in grants.

To encourage long-term adjustment, the United States promoted European and Japanese trade competitiveness. Policies for economic controls on the defeated former Axis countries were scrapped. Aid to Europe and Japan was designed to rebuild productivity and export capacity. In the long run it was expected that such European and Japanese recovery would benefit the United States by widening markets for U.S. exports and providing locations for U.S. capital expansion.

===Cold War===

In 1945, Roosevelt and Churchill prepared the postwar era by negotiating with Joseph Stalin at Yalta about respective zones of influence; this same year Germany was divided into four occupation zones (Soviet, American, British, and French).

Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau insisted that the Big Four (United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China) participate in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, but their plans were frustrated when the Soviet Union would not join the IMF. The reasons why the Soviet Union chose not to subscribe to the articles by December 1945 have been the subject of speculation.

Facing the Soviet Union, whose power had also strengthened and whose territorial influence had expanded, the U.S. assumed the role of leader of the capitalist camp. The rise of the postwar U.S. as the world&#x27;s leading industrial, monetary, and military power was rooted in the fact that the mainland U.S. was untouched by the war, in the instability of the nation states of postwar Europe, and the wartime devastation of the Soviet and European economies.

Despite the economic cost implied by such a policy, being at the center of the international market gave the U.S. unprecedented freedom of action in pursuing its foreign affairs goals. A trade surplus made it easier to keep armies abroad and to invest outside the U.S., and because other countries could not sustain foreign deployments, the U.S. had the power to decide why, when and how to intervene in global crises. The dollar continued to function as a compass to guide the health of the world economy and exporting to the U.S. became the primary economic goal of developing or redeveloping economies. This arrangement came to be referred to as the &quot;Pax Americana&quot;, in analogy to the &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; of the late 19th century and the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; of the first. (&quot;See&quot; Globalism)

==Late application==
===U.S. balance of payments crisis===
After the end of World War II, the U.S. held $26 billion in gold reserves, of an estimated total of $40 billion (approx 65%). As world trade increased rapidly through the 1950s, the size of the gold base increased by only a few percentage points. In 1950, the U.S. balance of payments swung negative. The first U.S. response to the crisis was in the late 1950s when the Eisenhower administration placed import quotas on oil and other restrictions on trade outflows. More drastic measures were proposed, but not acted upon. However, with a mounting recession that began in 1958, this response alone was not sustainable. In 1960, with Kennedy&#x27;s election, a decade-long effort to maintain the Bretton Woods System at the $35/ounce price began.

The design of the Bretton Woods System was such that countries could only enforce convertibility to gold for the anchor currency—the United States dollar. Conversion of dollars to gold was allowed but was not required. Governments could forgo converting dollars to gold, and instead hold dollars. Rather than full convertibility, the system provided a fixed price for sales between central banks. However, there was still an open gold market. For the Bretton Woods system to remain workable, it would either have to alter the peg of the dollar to gold, or it would have to maintain the free market price for gold near the $35 per ounce official price. The greater the gap between free market gold prices and central bank gold prices, the greater the temptation to deal with internal economic issues by buying gold at the Bretton Woods price and selling it on the open market.

In 1960 Robert Triffin, a Belgian-American economist, noticed that holding dollars was more valuable than gold because constant U.S. balance of payments deficits helped to keep the system liquid and fuel economic growth. What would later come to be known as Triffin&#x27;s Dilemma was predicted when Triffin noted that if the U.S. failed to keep running deficits the system would lose its liquidity, not be able to keep up with the world&#x27;s economic growth, and, thus, bring the system to a halt. But incurring such payment deficits also meant that, over time, the deficits would erode confidence in the dollar as the reserve currency created instability.

The first effort was the creation of the London Gold Pool on 1 November 1961 between eight governments. The theory behind the pool was that spikes in the free market price of gold, set by the morning gold fix in London, could be controlled by having a pool of gold to sell on the open market, that would then be recovered when the price of gold dropped. Gold&#x27;s price spiked in response to events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, and other less significant events, to as high as $40/ounce. The Kennedy administration drafted a radical change of the tax system to spur more production capacity and thus encourage exports. This culminated with the 1964 tax cut program, designed to maintain the $35 peg.

In 1967, there was an attack on the pound and a run on gold in the sterling area, and on 18 November 1967, the British government was forced to devalue the pound. U.S. President Lyndon Baines Johnson was faced with a difficult choice, either institute protectionist measures, including travel taxes, export subsidies and slashing the budget—or accept the risk of a &quot;run on gold&quot; and the dollar. From Johnson&#x27;s perspective: &quot;The world supply of gold is insufficient to make the present system workable—particularly as the use of the dollar as a reserve currency is essential to create the required international liquidity to sustain world trade and growth.&quot;

While West Germany agreed not to purchase gold from the U.S., and agreed to hold dollars instead, the pressure on both the dollar and the pound sterling continued. In January 1968 Johnson imposed a series of measures designed to end gold outflow, and to increase U.S. exports. This was unsuccessful, however, as in mid-March 1968 a dollar run on gold ensued through the free market in London, the London Gold Pool was dissolved, initially by the institution of &quot;ad hoc&quot; UK bank holidays at the request of the U.S. government. This was followed by a full closure of the London gold market, also at the request of the U.S. government, until a series of meetings were held that attempted to rescue or reform the existing system.

All attempts to maintain the peg collapsed in November 1968, and a new policy program attempted to convert the Bretton Woods system into an enforcement mechanism of floating the gold peg, which would be set by either &quot;fiat&quot; policy or by a restriction to honor foreign accounts. The collapse of the gold pool and the refusal of the pool members to trade gold with private entities—on 18 March 1968 the Congress of the United States repealed the 25% requirement of gold backing of the dollar—as well as the U.S. pledge to suspend gold sales to governments that trade in the private markets, led to the expansion of the private markets for international gold trade, in which the price of gold rose much higher than the official dollar price.
U.S. gold reserves remained depleted due to the actions of some countries, notably France, which continued to build up their own gold reserves.

===Structural changes===
====Return to convertibility====
In the 1960s and 1970s, important structural changes eventually led to the breakdown of international monetary management. One change was the development of a high level of monetary interdependence. The stage was set for monetary interdependence by the return to convertibility of the Western European currencies at the end of 1958 and of the Japanese yen in 1964. Convertibility facilitated the vast expansion of international financial transactions, which deepened monetary interdependence.

====Growth of international currency markets====
Another aspect of the internationalization of banking has been the emergence of international banking consortia. Since 1964 various banks had formed international syndicates, and by 1971 over three-quarters of the world&#x27;s largest banks had become shareholders in such syndicates. Multinational banks can and do make large international transfers of capital not only for investment purposes but also for hedging and speculating against exchange rate fluctuations.

These new forms of monetary interdependence made large capital flows possible. During the Bretton Woods era, countries were reluctant to alter exchange rates formally even in cases of structural disequilibria. Because such changes had a direct impact on certain domestic economic groups, they came to be seen as political risks for leaders. As a result, official exchange rates often became unrealistic in market terms, providing a virtually risk-free temptation for speculators. They could move from a weak to a strong currency hoping to reap profits when a revaluation occurred. If, however, monetary authorities managed to avoid revaluation, they could return to other currencies with no loss. The combination of risk-free speculation with the availability of large sums was highly destabilizing.

===Decline===

====U.S. monetary influence====
A second structural change that undermined monetary management was the decline of U.S. hegemony. The U.S. was no longer the dominant economic power it had been for more than two decades. By the mid-1960s, the E.E.C. and Japan had become international economic powers in their own right. With total reserves exceeding those of the U.S., higher levels of growth and trade, and per capita income approaching that of the U.S., Europe and Japan were narrowing the gap between themselves and the United States.

The shift toward a more pluralistic distribution of economic power led to increasing dissatisfaction with the privileged role of the U.S. dollar as the international currency. Acting effectively as the world&#x27;s central banker, the U.S., through its deficit, determined the level of international liquidity. In an increasingly interdependent world, U.S. policy significantly influenced economic conditions in Europe and Japan. In addition, as long as other countries were willing to hold dollars, the U.S. could carry out massive foreign expenditures for political purposes—military activities and foreign aid—without the threat of balance-of-payments constraints.

Dissatisfaction with the political implications of the dollar system was increased by &quot;détente&quot; between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The Soviet military threat had been an important force in cementing the U.S.-led monetary system. The U.S. political and security umbrella helped make American economic domination palatable for Europe and Japan, which had been economically exhausted by the war. As gross domestic production grew in European countries, trade grew. When common security tensions lessened, this loosened the transatlantic dependence on defence concerns, and allowed latent economic tensions to surface.

====Dollar====
Reinforcing the relative decline in U.S. power and the dissatisfaction of Europe and Japan with the system was the continuing decline of the dollar—the foundation that had underpinned the post-1945 global trading system. The Vietnam War and the refusal of the administration of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to pay for it and its Great Society programs through taxation resulted in an increased dollar outflow to pay for the military expenditures and rampant inflation, which led to the deterioration of the U.S. balance of trade position. In the late 1960s, the dollar was overvalued with its current trading position, while the German Mark and the yen were undervalued; and, naturally, the Germans and the Japanese had no desire to revalue and thereby make their exports more expensive, whereas the U.S. sought to maintain its international credibility by avoiding devaluation. Meanwhile, the pressure on government reserves was intensified by the new international currency markets, with their vast pools of speculative capital moving around in search of quick profits.

In contrast, upon the creation of Bretton Woods, with the U.S. producing half of the world&#x27;s manufactured goods and holding half its reserves, the twin burdens of international management and the Cold War were possible to meet at first. Throughout the 1950s Washington sustained a balance of payments deficit to finance loans, aid, and troops for allied regimes. But during the 1960s the costs of doing so became less tolerable. By 1970 the U.S. held under 16% of international reserves. Adjustment to these changed realities was impeded by the U.S. commitment to fixed exchange rates and by the U.S. obligation to convert dollars into gold on demand.

===Paralysis of international monetary management===

====Floating-rate system during 1968–1972====

By 1968, the attempt to defend the dollar at a fixed peg of $35/ounce, the policy of the Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, had become increasingly untenable. Gold outflows from the U.S. accelerated, and despite gaining assurances from Germany and other countries to hold gold, the unbalanced spending of the Johnson administration had transformed the dollar shortage of the 1940s and 1950s into a dollar glut by the 1960s. In 1967, the IMF agreed in Rio de Janeiro to replace the tranche division set up in 1946. Special drawing rights (SDRs) were set as equal to one U.S. dollar but were not usable for transactions other than between banks and the IMF. Governments were required to accept holding SDRs equal to three times their allotment, and interest would be charged, or credited, to each nation based on their SDR holding. The original interest rate was 1.5%.

The intent of the SDR system was to prevent countries from buying pegged gold and selling it at the higher free market price and give governments a reason to hold dollars by crediting interest, at the same time setting a clear limit to the amount of dollars that could be held.

====Nixon Shock====

A negative balance of payments, growing public debt incurred by the Vietnam War and Great Society programs, and monetary inflation by the Federal Reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued. The drain on U.S. gold reserves culminated with the London Gold Pool collapse in March 1968. By 1970, the U.S. had seen its gold coverage deteriorate from 55% to 22%. This, in the view of neoclassical economists, represented the point where holders of the dollar had lost faith in the ability of the U.S. to cut budget and trade deficits.

In 1971 more and more dollars were being printed in Washington, then being pumped overseas, to pay for government expenditure on the military and social programs. In the first six months of 1971, assets for $22 billion fled the U.S. In response, on 15 August 1971, Nixon issued pursuant to the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, unilaterally imposing 90-day wage and price controls, a 10% import surcharge, and most importantly &quot;closed the gold window&quot;, making the dollar inconvertible to gold directly, except on the open market. Unusually, this decision was made without consulting members of the international monetary system or even his own State Department and was soon dubbed the &quot;Nixon Shock&quot;.

====Smithsonian Agreement====
The August shock was followed by efforts under U.S. leadership to reform the international monetary system. Throughout the fall (autumn) of 1971, a series of multilateral and bilateral negotiations between the Group of Ten countries took place, seeking to redesign the exchange rate regime.

Meeting in December 1971 at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., the Group of Ten signed the Smithsonian Agreement. The U.S. pledged to peg the dollar at $38/ounce with 2.25% trading bands, and other countries agreed to appreciate their currencies versus the dollar. The group also planned to balance the world financial system using special drawing rights alone.

The agreement failed to encourage discipline by the Federal Reserve or the United States government. The Federal Reserve was concerned about an increase in the domestic unemployment rate due to the devaluation of the dollar. In an attempt to undermine the efforts of the Smithsonian Agreement, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in pursuit of a previously established domestic policy objective of full national employment. With the Smithsonian Agreement, member countries anticipated a return flow of dollars to the U.S., but the reduced interest rates within the United States caused dollars to continue to flow out of the U.S. and into foreign central banks. The inflow of dollars into foreign banks continued the monetization of the dollar overseas, defeating the aims of the Smithsonian Agreement. As a result, the dollar price in the gold free market continued to cause pressure on its official rate; soon after a 10% devaluation was announced in February 1973, Japan and the EEC countries decided to let their currencies float. This proved to be the beginning of the collapse of the Bretton Woods System. The end of Bretton Woods was formally ratified by the Jamaica Accords in 1976. By the early 1980s, all industrialised states were using floating currencies.

==The Bretton Woods system in the 21st century==

===2007–2008 financial crisis ===
During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, some policymakers, such as James Chace and others called for a new international monetary system that some of them also dub &quot;Bretton Woods II&quot;.

On 26 September 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said, &quot;we must rethink the financial system from scratch, as at Bretton Woods.&quot;

In March 2010, Prime Minister Papandreou of Greece wrote an op-ed in the International Herald Tribune, in which he said, &quot;Democratic governments worldwide must establish a new global financial architecture, as bold in its own way as Bretton Woods, as bold as the creation of the European Community and European Monetary Union. And we need it fast.&quot; In interviews coinciding with his meeting with President Obama, he indicated that Obama would raise the issue of new regulations for the international financial markets at the next G20 meetings in June and November 2010.

Over the course of the crisis, the IMF progressively relaxed its stance on &quot;free-market&quot; principles such as its guidance against using capital controls. In 2011, the IMF&#x27;s managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn stated that boosting employment and equity &quot;must be placed at the heart&quot; of the IMF&#x27;s policy agenda. The World Bank indicated a switch towards greater emphases on job creation.

=== 2020 crisis ===
Following the 2020 Economic Recession, the managing director of the IMF announced the emergence of &quot;A New Bretton Woods Moment&quot; which outlines the need for coordinated fiscal response on the part of central banks around the world to address the ongoing economic crisis.

<text>An orphan drug is a pharmaceutical agent that is developed to treat certain rare medical conditions. An orphan drug would not be profitable to produce without government assistance, due to the small population of patients affected by the conditions. The conditions that orphan drugs are used to treat are referred to as orphan diseases. The assignment of orphan status to a disease and to drugs developed to treat it is a matter of public policy that depends on the legislation (if there is any) of the country.

Designation of a drug as an orphan drug has yielded medical breakthroughs that might not otherwise have been achieved, due to the economics of drug research and development. Examples of this can be that in the U.S. and the EU, it is easier to gain marketing approval for an orphan drug. There may be other financial incentives, such as an extended period of exclusivity, during which the producer has sole rights to market the drug. All are intended to encourage development of drugs which would otherwise lack sufficient profit motive to attract corporate research budgets and personnel.

==Definition==

=== United States ===
According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an orphan drug is defined as one &quot;intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a rare disease or condition, which is one that affects less than 200,000 persons in the US&quot; (which equates to approximately 6 cases per 10,000 population) &quot;or meets cost recovery provisions of the act&quot;. 

=== Europe ===
In the European Union (EU), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) defines a drug as &quot;orphan&quot; if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically and seriously debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 EU people. EMA also qualifies a drug as orphan if – without incentives – it would be unlikely that marketing the drug in the EU would generate sufficient benefit for the affected people and for the drug manufacturer to justify the investment. 

=== Japan ===
In Japan, drugs and medical devices are given the designation as an orphan drug or device based on the Act of Securing Quality, Efficacy, Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Regenerative or Cellular Therapy Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics if they are intended for use in less than 50,000 patients in Japan for which there is a high medical need.

==Global statistics==
, there were 281 marketed orphan drugs and more than 400 orphan-designated drugs in clinical trials. More than 60% of orphan drugs were biologics. The U.S. dominated development of orphan drugs, with more than 300 trials, followed by Europe. Cancer treatment was the indication in more than 30% of orphan drug trials.
* Number of orphan drugs in clinical trials: 40
* Number of orphan drugs in phase 2 trial: 231
* Number of orphan drugs in U.S. clinical trials: 350 in the pipeline from research until registration

==Effect on investment, sales and profit==
According to Thomson Reuters in their 2012 publication &quot;The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs&quot;, there has been increased investment in orphan drug research and development, partly due to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (ODA) and similar acts in other regions of the world driven by &quot;high-profile philanthropic funding&quot;.

According to &quot;Drug Discovery Today&quot;, the years 2001 to 2011 were the &quot;most productive period in the history of orphan drug development, in terms of average annual orphan drug designations and orphan drug approvals&quot;. For the same decade the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the orphan drugs was an &quot;impressive 25.8%, compared to only 20.1% for a matched control group of non-orphan drugs&quot;. By 2012, the market for orphan drugs was worth US$637 million, compared with US$638 million for a control group of non-orphan drugs.

By 2012,

According to a 2014 report, the orphan drug market has become increasingly lucrative for a number of reasons. The cost of clinical trials for orphan drugs is substantially lower than for other diseases because trial sizes are naturally much smaller than for more diseases with larger numbers of patients. Small clinical trials and minimal competition place orphan agents at an advantage in regulatory review.

Tax incentives reduce the cost of development. On average the cost per patient for orphan drugs is &quot;six times that of non-orphan drugs, a clear indication of their pricing power&quot;. The cost of per-person outlays are large and are expected to increase with wider use of public subsidies.

The 2014 Orphan Drug report stated that the percentage of orphan drug sales as part of all prescription drug sales had been increasing at a rapid rate. The report projected a total of US$176 billion by 2020. Although orphan disease populations are the smallest, the cost of per-patient outlays among them are the largest and are expected to increase as more people with rare diseases become eligible for subsidies – in the U.S., for example, through the Affordable Care Act.

==Legislation==
Orphan drugs generally follow the same regulatory development path as any other pharmaceutical product, in which testing focuses on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, dosing, stability, safety and efficacy. However, some statistical burdens are lessened to maintain development momentum. For example, orphan drug regulations generally acknowledge the fact that it may not be possible to test 1,000 patients in a phase III clinical trial if fewer than that number are affected by the disease.

Government intervention on behalf of orphan drug development takes several forms:
* Tax incentives
* Exclusivity (enhanced patent protection and marketing rights)
* Research subsidies
* Creating a government-run enterprise to engage in research and development as in a Crown corporation

A 2015 study of &quot;34 key Canadian stakeholders, including drug regulators, funders, scientists, policy experts, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and patient advocates&quot; investigated factors behind the pharmaceutical industry growing interest in &quot;niche markets&quot; such as orphan drugs.

===United States===
The Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of January 1983, passed in the United States, with lobbying from the National Organization for Rare Disorders and many other organizations, is meant to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for diseases that have a small market. Under the ODA drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic agents would qualify for orphan status if they were intended to treat a disease affecting fewer than 200,000 American citizens. Under the ODA orphan drug sponsors qualify for seven-year FDA-administered market Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE), &quot;tax credits of up to 50% of R&amp;D costs, R&amp;D grants, waived FDA fees, protocol assistance and may get clinical trial tax incentives.

In the U.S., orphan drug designation means that the sponsor qualifies for certain benefits, but it does not mean the drug is safe, effective or legal.

In 2002, the Rare Diseases Act was signed into law. It amended the Public Health Service Act to establish the Office of Rare Diseases. It also increased funding for the development of treatments for people with rare diseases.

===European Union===
In 2000, the European Union (EU) enacted similar legislation, Regulation(EC) No 141/2000, which refers to drugs developed to treat rare diseases to as &quot;orphan medicinal products&quot;. The EU&#x27;s definition of an orphan condition is broader than that of the US, in that it also covers some tropical diseases that are primarily found in developing nations. Orphan drug status granted by the European Commission gives marketing exclusivity in the EU for 10 years after approval. The EU&#x27;s legislation is administered by the Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

In late 2007 the FDA and EMA agreed to use a common application process for both agencies to make it easier for manufacturers to apply for orphan drug status but, while continuing two separate approval processes.

===Other countries===
Legislation has been implemented by Japan, Singapore, and Australia that offers subsidies and other incentives to encourage the development of drugs that treat orphan diseases.

===Numbers of new drugs===
Under the ODA and EU legislation, many orphan drugs have been developed, including drugs to treat glioma, multiple myeloma, cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, snake venom poisoning, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

The Pharmaceutical Executive opines, that the &quot;ODA is nearly universally acknowledged to be a success&quot;.
Before the US Congress enacted the ODA in 1983, only 38 drugs were approved in the US specifically to treat orphan diseases. In the US, from January 1983 to June 2004, 249 orphan drugs received marketing authorization and 1,129 received different orphan drug designations, compared to fewer than ten such products in the decade prior to 1983. From 1983 until May 2010, the FDA approved 353 orphan drugs and granted orphan designations to 2,116 compounds. As of 2010, 200 of the roughly 7,000 officially designated orphan diseases have become treatable.

Critics have questioned whether orphan drug legislation was the real cause of this increase, claiming that many of the new drugs were for disorders which were already being researched anyway, and would have had drugs developed regardless of the legislation, and whether the ODA has truly stimulated the production of non-profitable drugs; the act also has been criticised for allowing some pharmaceutical companies to make a large profit off drugs which have a small market but sell for a high price.

While the European Medicines Agency grants orphan drugs market access in all member states, in practice, they only reach the market when a member state decides that its national health system will reimburse for the drug. For example, in 2008, 44 orphan drugs reached the market in the Netherlands, 35 in Belgium, and 28 in Sweden, while in 2007, 35 such drugs reached the market in France and 23 in Italy.

Though not technically an orphan disease, research and development into the treatment for AIDS has been heavily linked to the Orphan Drug Act. In the beginning of the AIDS epidemic the lack of treatment for the disease was often accredited to a believed lack of commercial base for a medication linked to HIV infection. This encouraged the FDA to use the Orphan Drug Act to help bolster research in this field, and by 1995 13 of the 19 drugs approved by the FDA to treat AIDS had received orphan drug designation, with 10 receiving marketing rights. These are in addition to the 70 designated orphan drugs designed to treat other HIV related illnesses.

==Examples for selected diseases==
=== Cystic fibrosis ===
In the 1980s, people with cystic fibrosis rarely lived beyond their early teens. Drugs like Pulmozyme and tobramycin, both developed with aid from the ODA, revolutionized treatment for cystic fibrosis patients by significantly improving their quality of life and extending their life expectancies. Now, cystic fibrosis patients often survive into their thirties and some into their fifties.

=== Familial hypercholesterolemia ===
The 1985 Nobel Prize for medicine went to two researchers for their work related to familial hypercholesterolemia, which causes large and rapid increases in cholesterol levels. Their research led to the development of statin drugs which are now commonly used to treat high cholesterol.

=== Wilson&#x27;s disease ===
Penicillamine was developed to treat Wilson&#x27;s disease, a rare hereditary disease that can lead to a fatal accumulation of copper in the body. This drug was later found to be effective in treating arthritis. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate is currently under investigation as a therapy against Wilson&#x27;s disease.

=== Phospholipase 2G6-associated neurodegeneration ===
In 2017, FDA granted RT001 orphan drug designation in the treatment of phospholipase 2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN).

=== Transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis ===
The FDA granted Patisiran (Onpattro) orphan drug status and breakthrough therapy designation due to its novel mechanism involving RNA therapy to block the production of an abnormal form of transthyretin. Patisiran received full FDA approval in 2018 and its RNA lipid nanoparticle drug delivery system was later used in the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna RNA vaccines.

==Activism, research centers==
The Center for Orphan Drug Research at the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy helps small companies with insufficient in-house expertise and resources in drug synthesis, formulation, pharmacometrics, and bio-analysis.
The Keck Graduate Institute Center for Rare Disease Therapies (CRDT) in Claremont, California, supports projects to revive potential orphan drugs whose development has stalled by identifying barriers to commercialization, such as problems with formulation and bio-processing.

Numerous advocacy groups such as the National Organization for Rare Disorders, Global Genes Project, Children&#x27;s Rare Disease Network, Abetalipoproteinemia Collaboration Foundation, Zellweger Baby Support Network, and the Friedreich&#x27;s Ataxia Research Alliance have been founded in order to advocate on behalf of patients with rare diseases with a particular emphasis on diseases that affect children.

==Cost==
According to a 2015 report published by EvaluatePharma, the economics of orphan drugs mirrors the economics of the pharmaceutical market as a whole but has a few very large differences. The market for orphan drugs is by definition very small, but while the customer base is drastically smaller the cost of research and development is very much the same as for non orphan drugs. This, the producers have claimed, causes them to charge extremely high amounts for treatment, sometimes as high as $700,000 a year, as in the case of Spinraza (Biogen), FDA approved in December 2016 for spinal muscular atrophy, placing a large amount of stress on insurance companies and patients. An analysis of 12 orphan drugs that were approved in the US between 1990 and 2000 estimated a price reduction of on average 50% upon loss of marketing exclusivity, with a range of price reductions from 14% to 95%.

Governments have implemented steps to reduce high research and development cost with subsidies and other forms of financial assistance. The largest assistance are tax breaks which can be as high as 50% of research and development costs. Orphan drug manufacturers are also able to take advantage of the small customer base to cut cost on clinical trials due to the small number of cases to have smaller trials which reduces cost. These smaller clinical trials also allow orphan drugs to move to market faster as the average time to receive FDA approval for an orphan drug is 10 months compared to 13 months for non-orphan drugs. This is especially true in the market for cancer drugs, as a 2011 study found that between 2004 and 2010 orphan drug trials were more likely to be smaller and less randomized than their non-orphan counterparts, but still had a higher FDA approval rate, with 15 orphan cancer drugs being approved, while only 12 non-orphan drugs were approved. This allows manufactures to get cost to the point that it is economically feasible to produce these treatments. The subsidies can total up to $30 million per fiscal year in the United States alone.

By 2015, industry analysts and academic researchers agreed, that the sky-high price of orphan drugs, such as eculizumab, was not related to research, development and manufacturing costs. Their price is arbitrary and they have become more profitable than traditional medicines.

==Public funding==
===Evaluation criteria===
By 2007 the use of economic evaluation methods regarding public-funding of orphan drugs, using estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness, for example, became more established internationally. The QALY has often been used in cost-utility analysis to calculate the ratio of cost to QALYs saved for a particular health care intervention. By 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales, for example, operated with a threshold range of £20,000–30,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). By 2005 doubts were raised about the use of economic evaluations in orphan drugs. By 2008 most of the orphan drugs appraised had cost-effectiveness thresholds &quot;well in excess of the &#x27;accepted&#x27; level and would not be reimbursed according to conventional criteria&quot;. As early as 2005 McCabe et al. argued that rarity should not have a premium and orphan drugs should be treated like other pharmaceuticals in general. Drummond et al. argued that the social value of health technologies should also be included in the assessment along with the estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

===Abuse potential===

The very large incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to produce orphan drugs have led to the impression that the financial support afforded to make these drugs possible is akin to abuse. Because drugs can be used to treat multiple conditions, companies can take drugs that were filed with their government agency as orphan drugs to receive financial assistance, and then market it to a wide population to increase their profit margin. For example AstraZeneca&#x27;s cholesterol drug Crestor was filed as a treatment for the rare disease pediatric familial hypercholesterolemia. After the drug was approved for orphan drug designation, and AstraZeneca had received tax breaks and other advantages, AstraZeneca later applied and received FDA approval for the drug to be used to treat cholesterol in all diabetics.

===NICE===
The UK&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) can pay from £100,000 to £300,000 per QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year) for treatments of &quot;very rare conditions&quot;. This is compared to under £20,000 for non-orphan drugs.

In 2015, NICE held consultations with &quot;patient groups, the Department of Health, companies, learned societies, charities and researchers&quot; regarding the appraisal of medicines and other technologies. There was a call for more research into new processes, including:
